I love the music-machine feel to the game.  * The puzzles do not give any sort of instruction, and give little indication of whether or not you're getting closer to the proposed solution. You are given a toy that is 100x more complex than a Rubik's Cube™. With no instructions and no idea what the winning conditions are. Good luck.  * The developers tell you to explore this vast world in order to activate the machine totally... but give you no map. I recommend Youtube walkthroughs if you're a completist. The Steam achievements for this game are not very clear, either.  * The game, with its Tron-like feel, at times resembles Las Vegas. Everything is lit up like an arcade and you have no idea where you are supposed to go next, or what is activated and what is not. The lack of communication (e.g., score, progress, direction) with the player is terrible.  Unfortunately, while the game scores great originality points with me, there was far too much else that I found lacking or frustrating so I cannot recommend it. I hope to see a sequel or expansion with some of these issues addressed. ",

            "review_text": "I won't try to compare this game to other games. There is no comparison. This game is about synthesizers. You interact with a world at your own pace, and music follows your footsteps.  If you have any interest in this kind of music (watch the trailer), and have a little bit of understanding of rhythm, you can play this game and enjoy it. I only played about 8 hours before solving the final puzzle, but it was easily one of my favorite games I have played in recent times. This game made me happier than any game I have played all year.  It is short and minimalistic. There are few instructions, no directions, and no words. You solve puzzles, and get very little from it. But what you do get is everything that you need, perfected. There's a wonderful feeling when the bass suddenly kicks in, because you solved a puzzle, with an added kick of enjoyment from hearing *your* music incorporated into it. Exploration is rewarded by finding little crystals that sing when you get near them, or the faint sound of a puzzle in the distance as you look over a world constructed with little more than basic blocks yet is still beautiful and intriguing.   The puzzles are impressive. The first puzzles you will encounter for each area are simple, preparing you for future puzzles without obvious tutorials, building to the final puzzles which can be incredibly complicated. Each puzzle is two parts - an approach puzzle, and then an ostensibly musical puzzle - yet despite what many on the internet think, each one can be solved with only logic, no brute forcing needed. There are not nearly enough puzzle games in the world that hit the right balance of solvable and difficult.   tl;dr: You like music? You like puzzles? You like creating instead of destroying? Pick this up. It's worth it.",

I never really got stuck; the most stuck I got was trying to find the next station or something. Despite the puzzles not being challenging, they were still extremely satisfying to solve, because the music gradually builds up as you're solving it, and once the final piece clicks into place, it all comes together and sounds amazing.  The visual style was very cool. The materials were bland, but the glowing lights made up for that.  And of course the sound design was excellent. My only complaint would be not giving the player more freedom with the music on game, but that would probably ruin the atmosphere if the player doesn't know music. Keeping everything in the same scale/chord was a good idea.  Overall I'd give it an 8/10. Not my favorite, but still a good adventure puzzle game.",

I don't need my hand held when I'm playing a game, but I couldn't even tell when I was looking at a puzzle, or scenery. The openness of the world means it's impossible to have any kind of meaningful puzzle difficulty curve, which makes it very hard to learn the 'language' of the game, and understand what it is you're trying to do. The reviews indicate that there's probably a pretty decent experience to be had here. But thanks to the obtuse design, I found myself unable to find it, and unwilling to invest more time searching for it.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the best games of 2014, even on its concept alone. FRACT OSC is a puzzle/adventure game set in a world based on sound, entirely available to explore at your own pace and it executes its ideas extremely well. Having said that, you need to be interested in music to enjoy this game as a large portion of the puzzles are based on step sequencing and other musical/compositional concepts. This even extends to the rewards for solving each puzzle being new tools in a 'music studio' that allows you to create your own songs. It's on the shorter side (I beat it in 7 hours but there is a lot of additional hidden stuff to explore and you'll probably spend some time in the music studio too) and the 'world' is appropriately sized for the game, though it transforms over the course of the game in a way that feels extremely involving. I'm trying to be as vague as possible because discovering things for yourself is what makes this game great and I don't want to ruin that for anyone interested in playing it, though I will tell you that a small portion of the puzzles can be reasonably obtuse. In summary, if you like music, making music, neon, puzzles, open worlds and Com Truise then this is the game for you.",

The beautiful and submersive enviorment allows the player to alter the area to escape. The music and sounds add to the game tremendously. Just out of beauty and originality I'd give this a 10/10. I don't see this game exploding throughout steam and being in everyones library. But I'd like that.

Some of them are so cleverly made that I was more that surprised, but I won't spoil it for anybody. Let's just say that solving puzzles never felt this rewarding before.   As a musician, this has become one of my favourite games. The fact that all of the sounds are live rendered in the game (it is a bit heavy on your computer, and unless you have a good CPU, it might crackle a bit), makes it so much better. I won't even begin about the inclusion of a usable studio for music production. It might not be as powerful as some DAWs, but it is insanely fun to play around with the same synths you already had to use to solve all the puzzles.  More than recommended, especially if you love electronic music and adventure games.",

You get to play with synthesizers! There are simple settings and more complex ones that unlock after you beat the game for those of you who actually know what you are doing. Saving songs is a cinch, and uploading them to youtube is equally so. If you have ever enjoyed creating music, this game is hard to pass up.  Good: Cool atmosphere with amazing sound quality and some intense puzzles  Bad: May be too difficult for some, no jump button  Ugly: If you mess around with the advanced settings, you can produce some ****ed up sounds.

            "review_text": "FRACT OSC is a rather unique type of game. Puzzle doesn't really cover it, and neither does adventure. Exploration is a very important aspect of the game, and I guess that's the brunt of its charm.   The game starts you off in a curious environment, something akin to a studio, where the player has to find his or her own way around. A quick, wordless tutorial is all you get to help you get acquainted with how the game functions, before you are taken into the main area of the game.  Its expansiveness is mesmerising. A beautifully sculpted world will leave you wide-eyed as you stumble around until things make sense. The confusion can be disheartening at first. There's no explanation in words, no exposition. It can take a while before things start to click. But once they do, you'll feel very much in control. You feel like you have a purpose, like you know what you are doing and there's a healthy feeling of accomplishment that comes with it.   It's a shame that the game isn't too long. But it's something I'd want to do again, and probably even more than twice. The game speaks to the player not in words, but in music. And that means it plays on your emotions. Mind you, it doesn't bring you rage or sadness, but instead it knows how to make you feel euphoric after completing a section.   The end reward is something fun as well. After you've completed the exploration and puzzle sequences, you're left with a fully functional studio that allows you to mix and create your own songs. You can even use some of the puzzle solutions you've learned before in your songs if you so wish.  Overall, I guess it comes down to that wordless connection it builds with the player. It doesn't feel harsh or unforgiving at all, but the world, while desolate, seems to be reaching out to the player somewhat. It tunes in and draws you in far more strongly than most games would, and that's a big chunk of its charm.   I can recommend this to virtually anyone. People who do not like puzzles might want to steer clear, but for those who do: FRACT OSC is a must-have.",

Check the forums to see if you may be affected before throwing down your cash)   For me there's something entirely irresistible about the idea of playing a game that is ready to hand me the keys to a labyrinthine world slathered in elegant, minimalistic eye-candy, bolstered by a soundtrack that... well... is entirely unique.  By messing around with the puzzles you invariably encounter through exploration around the world of FRACT OSC, you quickly pick up on the musical theme of the game, and - more importantly - an idea of how to progress.  The puzzles smoothly ramp up in challenge, testing your ability to match the interface controls, with the visual stimulus in order to create the 'right music' to proceed. It's an ingeniously engaging concept that has immediate and tangible rewards.   Things only get better as you layer your puzzled-masterpiece and bring the 'world' back to life, revealing all-new challenges.    After all is said and done, you're left with a very functional, and extremely beautiful synthesiser. Compositions can be saved and nothing feels better than stepping back and watching the game's world flash and spin and shift with your music.    However, there's no free-dinner with this game - you'll have to pay for the multi-functionality (as well as the very dynamic audio-scape) with an intense and significantly high CPU requirement. Despite the minimalistic visuals, it's easy to find yourself in areas that place a strain on the game, bringing the smooth framerate to a choppy crawl. Thankfully the puzzles are not dependant on a high framerate (at least, not as much as your average game), making the poor performance more of a disappointing shame than a frustrating game-breaking (and game-quitting) problem.  For those with more than a twinge of an interest in exploration, puzzling and musical creativity, this game couldn't be better focused to your needs. Grab a solid set of headphones, or crank up the sound system and bathe in the joy that is FRACT OSC.",
