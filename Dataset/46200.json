            "review_text": "This game really has the feel of star wars pod racing. You can pick up power-ups that can affect the gameplay of the match. It can get a little frustrating in the begging to drive each vehicle. The graphics are alright and fun to look at. The opponents can be very stupid at times and run into the walls. The game is a good arcade racer with potential to be alot of fun. I would recommend this game to any racer that likes having power-ups to blow the competition away. Its a good game but can be improved.",
