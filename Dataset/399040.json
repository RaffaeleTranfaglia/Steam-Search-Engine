            "review_text": "This game is wonderful with only one drawback...you can't replay hands if you miss cards. This is very frustrating. You can replay the whole level but not individual hands. This is the only thing that irks me because I am a completionist. Otherwise its a great solitaire game, reminds me of The Chronicles of Emerland Solitaire a bit with the whole companion aspect.",

You have lots of levels to play through, different kind of weapons and potions you can buy and you get companions that give more ways to get rid of the cards. I played through the game in 11 hours but you can always replay the levels. Well worth a buy!          YouTube™ Video:  Legends Of Solitaire Curse Of The Dragons&nbsp;",

This plays in a similar manner/rules, but has a lot more muddling it. Random things like a dragons flame, or locks happening, either damning you to not get a perfect (unless you're very lucky with your card draws), or necessitating going into the shop to spend money on a consumable item. It breaks the flow and makes the game frustrating.  It's not a bad game but it feels like a downgrade--like there was artificial difficulty put in, just for the sake of being hard, rather than more fun. If you're about to purchase this game based on how much you like Faerie Solitaire, you might be disappointed...",
