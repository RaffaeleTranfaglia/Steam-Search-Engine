            "review_text": "Long before there was Candy Crush, there was Bejeweled. This is a simple, casual game with a grid that requires you to shift colored jewels and match them into lines of 3 - 5. You can only shift 2 jewels if it will result in a line of 3+ matching colors. Very easy game, but where this game blossoms is all of the mini games / variations of it. Dozens of modes, all centered around making lines. There is classic mode that has you going through levels making lines, lightning rush, which has a very limited time and you need to collect time ups to keep going, diamond mine, where you need to match lines near the bottom rock to destroy the rock and progress further down. Bejeweled poker which every line is like a hand gains you something similar to a card in poker. Butterfly mode has you making lines with jewel butterflies to keep them from reaching the top of the screen where it will be an end of game. There is also a never ending zen mode, which is just like classic only without levels that break the flow of what you have going. Finally, there is an ice breaker mode which forces you to keep up with rising and freezing water. Once a line gets frozen enough its game over.  In a way, I prefer Candy Crush, because they have focus on levels, rather than letting you free to pick modes to play. I just feel overwhelmed with all of the choices and just end up playing 'classic' mode for the most part. On a plus side, unlike Candy Crush, there are no micro transactions. You've bought the whole game and need to unlock the modes.  Bejeweled 3 has a level system that keeps track of all of your points throughout all of your games and a high score amongst your friends. That seems to be my real driving force to play the game, just to beat my friend's high scores and since every time you play, you start with a random grid of jewels, its got something to do with luck as well as skill.  I can recommend the game, but I could recommend it more on the phone. I just feel there are better games I could be playing on my PC than something as simple as this. Tetris sold Gameboys, not Nintendo Entertainment Systems.",

Although I am not the biggest fan of the genre this game has enough creative ideas and game modes to keep the game interesting and fresh. Although the game play is basic, simply moves gems around to create three of the same type, with enough practice you learn that there is some strategy involved.  I’m sure people who love these types of games can spend 100s of hours playing it.",

            "review_text": "I didn't think I could ever get into puzzle games until I picked this one up.  The Bejeweled franchise is similar to those typical facebook game apps (Candy Crush being a good example), where you must match identical gems next to each other by swapping them across the screen. However, you can only swap gems that are above, below, and to the left and right of each other. The game not only challenges your eyesight, but your strategical skills as well.  The main game can keep you entertained for a couple hours, though it offers other gamemodes if it feels too repetitive. Some require you to work under a time limit, destroying gems to accomplish objectives, and more. You'll find that a couple gamemodes may require you to plan ahead while you play on to guarantee your success.  Obviously, the game is perfect for casual gamers and competitive players alike. I am a little disappointed that the main game (Classic mode) usually predetermines your outcome for you. You can find yourself reaching past level 10+, or even lose at the beginning of level 2 - all because of the gem randomizer. A 'NO MORE MOVES' announcement will pop up on the screen, which means...well, there are no more successful gem movements you can make. This is the only way to get a game over, but it comes out of nowhere and you can't do anything about it. There may be some kind of strategy to minimize your chances (AKA scoring as many points as possible in single turns to move to the next level), but you are going to lose randomly eventually.  Overall it's still worth a buy with the amount of content provided. The game has an amazing HD polish, complimented by the clear sound effects. Go ahead and give it a try!",

            "review_text": "This review is based on the game's status as of August 20th, 2015 (4 years and 8 months after release).  First off, I just want to say that this game is very fun to play. As basic as it is, Bejeweled 3 has me beating a level, then saying to myself 'one more level,' which then turns into 5 more levels. With several modes and minigames, it seems that there is much to go around for $5.00, and I'm sure I would find myself playing this games for many hours at a time if it wasn't for one thing: hints.  There is a big button on the left of every level titled 'hints,' which I can click on as many times as I want for the game to tell me what move to make. This doesn't bother me, but what does bother me is the automatic hints. If I take about maybe 15-20 seconds to decide on my move, the game will actually tell me what to choose, which definitely removes the whole point of even playing this game. I don't know what PopCap was thinking, because this feature not only demotivates me from playing, but it makes me feel like I didn't complete the level by myself, and that's true.  PopCap support has released a statement reguarding the issue: 'The hunt function is built into the game and cannot be disabled.'  Seriously, this feature ruins the whole game for me. Why is there even a giant hint button on the screen if you're just going to give me the hint every turn anyway? That is beyond ridiculous and borderline stupid.  This game also supports only 4:3 aspect ratio resolutions, yet you can still play this game at 16:9, so that's not a big deal for me, which is why I'm only focusing on the hints. I only recommend this game to people who can deal with these issues.  I'm going to make one thing clear: I DON'T WANT THE GAME TO PLAY FOR ME!",

The base mode is mindless fun, while the various other modes run all the way from peaceful zen gaming to time-limited, intensive searching. Almost every aspect of this game shows that someone at Popcap decided to stop, test, and thnk, making it a smooth, polished experience. (Polished gemstones... heh.)  (2) Like Portal, the voice acting is annoying.  Heartily reccomended.",
