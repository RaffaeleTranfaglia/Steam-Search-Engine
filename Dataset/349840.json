            "review_text": "I'd like to preface this with something. Though I am the voiceover actor for Simo in Ancestory, I'd still like to write as concise and unbiased of a review as possible.  Ancestory is not perfect. It suffers from a lack of content and a dwindling playerbase straight out the door. But does this mean the game itself isnt worth the money? I'd probably say no.  Taking inspiration from the very best TCG games and mixing it with a Fire Emblem esque grid system, Ancestory is a unique game for sure.  Gameplay:  Simple and accessible, perfect to boot up against a friend every now and then. The game itself works with very few hitches, and runs at a snappy 60 FPS. The mix of minions and spells offer decent variety in strategy for the most part. Unfortunately, the overall card count is a tad low, and there are few comback mechanics to keep you invested in the event that your opponet makes a really good couple of plays early on. It's still fun and funtional, and that matters quite a bit.  Sound: The music and sound effects get the job done, though they arent anything groundbreaking. The Desert Temple track is one I am particularly fond of though. Voice acting is generally pretty solid overall, with a few standout performances.   Visuals: The game has a cool neon aesthetic that helps to differentiate teams, and the color coded minions have their own unique flavor because of it. Nothing incredible, but it works.  Replayability: This is where Ancestory stumbles a bit. The card count is low, and the multiplayer community is very, very small. Until Kajak adds some more features, the game may be on the backburner.  Overall Score: 7/10  Ancestory is good, but it's held back by a pretty severe lack of content. Fifteen bucks isnt too bad, and will most likely be worth it once more content is added. If you want to buy Ancestory, know that you may need to come back to it every now and then to see the new content. If you want a cheap, neat little strategy game, I would still reccomend it.",

            "review_text": "While not for everyone, I had quite a bit of fun with Ancestory. Ancestory is kind of a combination between a card game and a turn based strategy game. The objective of the game is to gain points. You earn points by controlling totems or killing the other player's shaman.   While there are more complicated card games on Steam, I liked that Ancestory decided to streamline the gameplay. The game doesn't require reading a lot of text on the cards or learning complex rules. You can pretty much learn the basics of the game within ten minutes and you can usually finish a game in around twenty minutes.   While the game has a computer player to play against, I would highly recommend playing against another person since the AI is not particularly good and you can beat it pretty easily. The camera is a little hard to control at times. I also wish there were more cards in the game and that you would unlock new cards quicker.   If you are looking for an easier turn based strategy game that uses cards, I think you should enjoy Ancestory. Note: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.
