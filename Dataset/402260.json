This game has great jumpscares, if it comes to it. Cause its not about it at all. Its about the atmosphere, about the thrilling environment and whole case is pretty good.   Also, great thing is, that the story is pretty amazing for horror game. Like you seriously want to solve that case and if you play it right, and if you play it carefuly slowly, you will solve the case.  I seriously loved this game. 11/10",

There are multiple endings depending on how you handle the murder case and the clues you find.   The story was very compelling and discovering more about the suspects and the victim was quite fun on its own. I would definetly recommend this game and if you can play it with a VR headset then please do!  10/10 perfectly timed scares and ambience",

            "review_text": "The story is great and the puzzles aren't too hard. Moving around took a bit getting used to, but I think that was because I was using a controller and having camera control in the left stick felt strange. Otherwise the limited movement was actually a good thing, because I tend to get confused in games where you can go everywhere, not knowing what to do next. For example, I got stuck in one place where I had just two rooms available, so I knew the answer had to be in those rooms and just kept looking until I found it.   There were some creepy moments and a couple of moments of panic. Unfortunately, what happened after the panic moments never got explained in the story, or at least in the parts I found. I did miss a few documents, so I didn't get quite the entire story. I rarely go back to games like this, because it's not the same once you know the story, but I think I'll replay this one, just to find the missing documents and see what I was supposed to do with the couple of items that got left over.",

            "review_text": "I'm a bit of a horror junkie when it comes to movies and TV shows, so I thought I might be into horror games, too. The problem is, I enjoy mystery and puzzle games more than survival or action games, so hack-and-slash zombie games and the like are all out. This game was perfect for what I wanted.  I can also honestly say that, despite having a series of jumpscares I could easily count on one hand, I had trouble playing this alone. There's just something about this game's atmosphere, lighting, music choices, etc. that I found terrifying. Not in an in-your-face, loud, or flashy sort of way, but in a creeping, get-under-your-skin kind of way.   In terms of gameplay, the puzzles vary in difficulty but are sufficiently interesting throughout. I also like that the game requires you to draw your own conclusions about who did the whodunit. A fun, somewhat bizarre, horror-tinged mystery game that you might enjoy playing if you're into puzzle and investigative games. With a friend. And the lights on.",

Once I got used to being inside someone elses body and staying lined up correctly (if you dont you see her body get all contorted and it was creepy at first haha) this game was an absolute joy. It took my a while to actually finish it....that dark basement downstairs was too much for me in VR but I finally built up the nerve to just do it and wow what a game. I will definitely play this one through a second maybe third time....I want to find all the endings!",

Once I got the mask I kept putting it on and just seeing things. Creepy things.  Was a little confused after jumping out a window and stuff but it goes back to the house.  Gah, I haven't even solved the mystery, yet. Had to take a break. I have Sim Sickness but it is getting better the more I used VR and didn't want to turn on the 'Sensitive' option on.",

            "review_text": "Good game for VR, really atmospheric and scary in places. Almost no Jump-scares, most of the horror comes from confronting the murderer head on, as well as the possibility the murderer could be anywhere nearby. The puzzles are not too taxing, most are realitively easy to solve. The story is interesting and kept me invested in the gameplay.   I have a few complaints; firstly the 'body' you inhabit in-game (the female reporter with the broken arm), is rooted to one spot, so roomscale movement causes her body to contort and stretch. Often it would even seemingly 'rise' up over the camera, making it difficult to see. Secondly, most of the game is spent reading clues (diary entries, letters, newspapers, story chapters), and the notebook you read from is always aimed downwards. Vives are more heavy than most VR headsets and at times I found myself getting a neck ache from looking down at an angle so much. This won't affect everybody but it will affect some, so it'd be nicer if the text was at eye level during reading.   Those complaints are rather minor, though, and I extremely enjoyed this little experience. I wish there was more of it and I can't wait for more VR horror games like this.",

CONS : You walk like a 90 old women with arthritis, as well as the monsters. Not as scary as I would have liked without VR, but if you are using VR it should meet your spooky expectations. Needs some tweaking for PC, W A S D controls would have made it A LOT more comfortable, they litteraly just exported it without doing anything to make it more suitable for PC. Also really short.  Some tips : Don't look at the monkey, don't touch the monkey, don't speak to the monkey, don't listen to the monkey, don't even think about the monkey. If your stuck in an endless hallway, just go backwards one space, i figured this out the hard way.  After thoughts : Nuclear Bombs and Spaceships where all the rage in the 1960's, should have been something to do with that. If this old geezer that was murdered was building a nuke in his basement this would have been a whole lot cooler.  Conclusion : Worth buying, you'll have fun, but don't set your expectations to high.",
