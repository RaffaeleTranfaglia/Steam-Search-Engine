        {
            "review_text": "This is a unique take on Match-Three Competitive games. It adds an area limitation - you can only make matches on your side, but matching 4 or more moves the divider over a column for the rest of your turn. This adds an additional level of complexity (on top of the traditional match-3 combat options like collecting resources and using abilities) which works surprisingly well. The story is laughably unimportant and the graphics are workable but not impressive. But honestly, none of that matters - the gameplay is sound and a lot of fun. If you're a fan of Puzzle Quest or Gems of War, this is a good, distinctive take on the style. It's relatively short, but there are lots of replay opportunities.",
