            "review_text": "I'll give just about any platformer a try, but this was one of those games that was just unplayable for me. The graphics and soundtrack are mediocre at best, and the level design is nothing spectacular, but what sent this game directly to the uninstall pile was the controls.  The first thing I did was to check the discussion forum for the game. The first thing I noticed was how few posts there were, and the second thing I noticed was that of the very few who have posted on the page, I'm not the only one with this issue, and no real help or even acknowledgement of the problem exists from the developer.   What I found interesting was that these issues were not just limited to controller support. While I was using a wired XBox 360 controller, another poster mentioned that he'd experienced these issues with both a controller and keyboard. I'm of the opinion that there shouldn't be a platformer in today's market that doesn't include native controller support, but to each his own.   The responsiveness of the controls is terrible. It's nowhere near consistent, and the delay/lag between button presses and action on the screen is frustrating. It is nearly impossible to consistently jump while in motion, and if you can't do that in a platformer, you're better off not playing at all.  I can't recommend the game at this time, and I encourage the developer to acknowledge and resolve these issues.",

            "review_text": "Though i've liked the visuals and music, the game is a complete crap when it comes to platforming. Fall damage, bad jumping mechanics, collectibles that force you to die at the end of level as there's no other way to get them, unavoidable damage, random sections where you rely on pure luck.  Avoid unless you're interested in half an hour 100% game.",

Game length is 30 mins max but is FUN! Kind of game you would blast out while waiting for your Dinner to cook!  BUT i dont undertand how you can have Fall Damage in a platformer!!! VERY VERY Fustrating!  ",
