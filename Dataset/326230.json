    "description": "Smugglers 5: Invasion is a standalone expansion for the turn-based science-fiction space trading game, Smugglers 5. It starts where the original game ended. After years of civil war, the Federation finally emerged victorious, crushing all rebellion. Then came the Jalkath, an invading alien race looking much like the tigers of Old Earth.",

            "review_text": "Invasion does not make everything different (it´s an expansion!!), but what it does make different adds so much more to the game! If you liked Smugglers and you have a remotely interest in the new scenario (cat-like warrior aliens invading humans), pick this game up. The base game had been 30$, so 10$ is a bargain and it´s well worth the money.",
