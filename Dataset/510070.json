            "review_text": "I’m Rick Harrison and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss, and in 23 years I’ve learned one thing. You never know what is gonna come through that door.  On this episode of Pawn Stars I got an original contract that the who signed to perform at Woodstock. The who is one of the biggest bands of all time. That's a pretty important piece of memorabilia. What are you trying to get out of it? So what have we got here? Old faithful high-speed washing machine. Looks real high-speed. The faster you crank it, the faster it goes. Could you imagine bringing this thing home to mom, telling her, 'this is what you're doing laundry with now'? She'd punch me in the face. I've got a set of antique pistols. This a dueling set. They could be worth some serious money. They look 98% real to me, except for one thing I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, big hoss. Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years, you never know what is gonna come through that door. [upbeat bluesy guitar music] What can I help you with, man? I have a flask, not just any flask. This one opens up at the bottom. There was a note in here. You have a message in a bottle. Yes, I do. Awesome. I decided to come to the pawn shop today to sell my civil war flask. I was cleaning out my grandfather's basement he passed away and I came across it in a box, and I saw the note in it, and then I figured, you know, it was worth something. I just lost my job and need the money. I figured a couple hundred bucks would help me out. So when did you write the note? I didn't write that. Yeah, right. Okay, it says, 'silver whiskey flask 'carried by David Alexander Shepherd '1823 to 1883 'before, during, and after the civil war 'in which he was entrusted with the funds 'of two confederate banks 'with the instructions to stay out of the way of the Yankees. ' Well, there's a whole little story along with him. I mean, the neat thing was, I mean, if you were a spy or something like that, I mean, unless someone looked at this thing really closely, they wouldn't have noticed. This flask is awesome. It's definitely silver and very high-quality. It's the type of item that wouldn't sit around long on the shelves of my store. I'm interested, because the only thing better than making money is making money fast. Smells like stagnant water in there. [Laughter] All right. You can just tell by the hallmarks, it's old. Those are English hallmarks, and it says 'd. A. Shepherd' right across the front of it. The great thing is, it's in beautiful shape. So what do you want to do? You want to pawn it or sell it? I want to sell it. Okay, and how much do you want for it? I don't know. I don't what something like this is worth. I mean, this thing is from the 1850s or the 1840s. All right. How about $800? Um, it's not too far off. I was thinking more in the neighborhood of $500. $650, you have a deal. [Sighs] I'll tell you what, I'll do 600 bucks. Yeah, I think it's a fair price. All right. Okay? All right, chum, can you go write him up? Sure. I'm psyched to get this flask. You can tell by the way it's made, it's definitely old, but I keep thinking about that note, and if there's any way to validate the story, I can probably get a few hundred more bucks for it, so I'm gonna call in my buddy and see if he can authenticate it for me. [Cash register dings] [Bluesy guitar music] Ã Ã hey, how's it going, man? Hey, what's going on? What do we got? I got an original contract that the who signed to perform at Woodstock, the greatest band of all time. Don't you hope you die before you get old? Stone cold. [Laughter] I came to the pawn shop today to sell my 1969 contract for the who to perform at the Woodstock festival. The who is the greatest band, baba o'Riley, behind blue eyes. It's a piece of rock history. Who wouldn't want it? 'New action ltd. Furnishing the services of the who with Woodstock ventures inc. ' And it's signed by Michael lang himself. He did not only the '69. He did the '94. He did the 25-year anniversary. It's the real deal. This is pretty cool, man. The who was one of the biggest bands of all time, and if that's legit, that's a pretty important piece of memorabilia right there. This is the contract the band signed before playing in Woodstock. I mean, contracts like this could sell for big numbers, and it's not every day that something like this just walks through the door. Where'd you get it? My mom likes to go to yard sales, so while we were at one of the places, I was just looking around, and they had a couple albums, and the who's my favorite band, and I opened the album, and it was there. One of the biggest bands in the world at the time only got paid $12,500 to play one of the biggest shows of all time. Yeah, well, $12,500 back then was a lot of money, Corey. I made about $200 a month in the Navy at that time. What do you want to do with it? I want to sell it, because I really want to buy a new car. What are you trying to get out of it, son? I was looking for 5 grand. Well, you can keep looking. It looks real, except paperwork has been forged in the past. The signatures are all legit. I'm gonna have to have somebody take a look at it. It's gonna have to be sent off to a few different documentation companies. It's not it's not something as easy as just, 'oh, here's 5 grand,' and you walk out the door, and I take this. I mean, it's how about an offer? I'll make you an offer, but it's gonna be 100 bucks, man. I mean, for 100 bucks, I might as well keep it. Yeah, well, that's your privilege. Can you do $1,500? No, we're not even on the same planet. I really think the total value here is somewhere around $1,000. And after I get it certified, all that stuff, I mean, I'm putting some pretty decent money into it. I'll give you 200 bucks for it, man, and that's only because I think my father will like it. Top-of-the-line, Corey. All right. All right, man, deal. Let's go do some paperwork, my friend. The who is one of the biggest bands of the '60s and '70s, and my dad really loves them, and if this thing's legit, it could be worth some serious money. [Upbeat bluesy guitar music] Ã Ã a few days ago, I got a call from a guy wanting to sell me his antique hand-crank washing machine, so me and Corey are on our way to his place to check it out. So what have we got here? An old faithful high-speed washing machine. Yeah, it looks real high-speed. It is. The faster you crank it, the faster it goes. This is cool. I mean, you could lose weight and do your laundry at the same time. I called the guys at the pawn shop to come out to my house to see if they were interested in buying my antique washing machine. I'm a collector of certain antique pieces, but they have to be really kind of strange and unique. But I need some room. I have too many pieces in my house. So what do you know about it? The construction looks like it's all pine, all original, patent date on it of 1892 and 1898. There was two different patents on it. It has the original handle, which comes out, surprising that it hasn't been lost, but it has all the original stenciling. Everything is all-original, flywheel, gears. So how does this thing work? If you open this up, this is where you put your clothes in. You fill it with water and put your detergent in there, and you would close it and just crank it, a high-speed washer. The faster you go, the higher the speed. [Laughs] It cranks real easy now. I can imagine it full of water and clothes. Could you imagine just bringing this thing home to mom and just telling her, 'this is what you're doing laundry with now'? She'd punch me in the face. [Laughter] Believe it or not, this was a time-saver and a luxury. These types of machines were really popular up until the late 1800s,",
