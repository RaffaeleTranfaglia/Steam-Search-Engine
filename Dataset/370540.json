If you love statistics that do matter to the game, not just fancy charts and numbers to fool stategylovers to buy the game but tons of real numbers that relates to the actual gameplay, this is a game for you. And there is tons af numbers...  You do need to read the manual and have some try and error-games behind you to really enjoy but its worth it.",

            "review_text": "Steam doesn't reflect play time for this game - I only actually installed it on steam to write this. Lots of positive reviews. I'll put in the negative one because this game has one huge flaw. It's a strategic level game with copious detail to try and allow for historically plausible outcomes from player decisions. Only railway lines have infinite supply. Yes, you can feed the entire German army and airforce from just one (two track) railway line. Or the Red Army if Soviets are your thing. Since the game's release this has caused endless attempts to balance and re-balance the game.   It's a huge flaw. War in the West is supposed to have learned from this, so you may want to investigate that. War in the Pacific:Admiral's Edition scratches itches even the most obsessive micromanager didn't know he had. But War in the East, for all the appearance of detail and immensity, is a game which is horribly holed below the water line by the infinite supply on a railway line.  The one Matrix game I wish I could have refunded if I'd know the issue was never going to be fixed.",

The deph is astonishing, the historical acuracy of the units are mind blowing. It's like having the whole ww2 encyclopedia with all the units in your hands and I bet that the reasearch behind this was very long. Everything is on big scale, huge scenarios with amazing care for detail where each soldier, tank, weapon, arty support..have it's range, firepower and strenght calculated among with other factor like terrain, fatigue, weather and commander.  Once you get hand's on this game you will fully understand the price of the game, the developers have created a game that other big developers even dream about.  If you look for 100% realism, and want to unleash your historical 4.000 different troops on the battle, you must have this tittle in your list. It may take days to capture one small city or region weeks for a scenario, this is epic!  Waiting for more updates from this great team.",
