From falling into the ground 2 minutes in to most of the controls not even being mapped is just plain BS. I have never seen such a piece of junk game in my life. I have tried a few times and about 5 minutes into a campaign I get stuck inside a bus that drove up on the sidewalk working to the garage one campaign mission 1. After these 2 stupid issues and the inability to skip scenes just WOW. Please Please Please do not by this trash. Good gaming and see you all around. I hope I saved a life today. :) Did I mention how bad this game is. First Thumbs down review from me.",
