It took me about 10 hours to complete, which is 'short' by visual novel standards, but that means that it's not longer than it needs to be, and manages to keep the suspense up throughout.  If you want a good sci-fi thriller, and even if you're not too sure about the visual novel format, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game.",
