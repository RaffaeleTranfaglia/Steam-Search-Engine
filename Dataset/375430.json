            "review_text": "I got this game in a bundle. So, for me, it was definitely worth the $0.50-$1.00 to pick this up. It's a quite unique turn-based JRPG with some neat gimmics that set it apart from your standard RPGmaker fare.   The dialogue is witty and intelligent, at least from what I've seen so far. The combat system goes in the same vein, using a system of 'Pathos, Ethos, and Logos' to use logic and reasoning to beat your opponents instead of violence. You attack their willpower instead of their 'HP.' It's a neat way to ease up on the monotony of many JRPGs. In the end, though, you're still hitting enemies for number amounts of 'damage,' the only difference being in the form of what you call the damage (e.g., willpower damage via argumentation).   So it may be worth picking up for you. I haven't got very far in it, obviously, but I wanted to give this game some love due to the fact that it had no reviews before this one. Worth $10? That's up to you. Probably worth it on sale and definitely in a bundle.  6.3/10?",
