Certain factors may be outside of your control, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be overcome. Tharsis is not a game about facing the odds. It’s a game about changing them.",

            "review_text": "The vast majority of this game revolves around the following: - 1 or more events ('bad things') occur each turn. - All of these events involve a module of your ship becoming damaged in some way, with a consequence for leaving the module unrepaired and a certain amount of repair points required to repair it. - Each of your crew memebrs gets a number of dice. - You move one or more crew members to the damaged module. - The crew members roll their dice. - If the result is higher than the number of repair points then you successfully repaired the module. If not, you suffer the consqeuences of leaving it unrepaired.  If you have a crew member with some dice left over, you can engage in some of the other 'gameplay' on offer, such as: - Moving your character to the food module, then rolling their dice and trying to get 3 of the same number in order to get food. - Moving your character to the communication module, rolling their dice and trying to roll &gt;5 in order to reduce that characters 'stress level'. - Moving your character to the medbay, rolling their dice, trying to roll &gt;5 to heal your character.  Do you see where this is going? The entire game is the one single mechanic. Move a person to a module. Roll their dice. Either go 'Yay. I did it.' or 'Dang. I failed.' entirely at the mercy of RNG.  As a result of this, it feels to me more like I am watching the game play itself, with me just along to look at it (not helped by the fact that the game is not very pretty.)  I did not find this game very entertaining. I don't like being so heavily at the mercy of RNG. Maybe this could be forgiven a little if there was more variety in terms of the events that happen and the actual gameplay involved, but there is so little content. It feels like Early Access.",

            "review_text": "'Its the journey, not the destination that matters' -Said someone sometime  This is a dice game with a Random Number Generator at its core. I want to stress the word RANDOM. That means you will lose and lose a lot because the game randomly decided to make you lose. The same as when you roll dice in real life and they land however they land. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.  If you do not like to lose, then do not buy this game. Your crew will die, your ship will explode, and you will lose the game because of a completely random bad roll of the dice and it will happen often, but everything can go good too and you can win. It is a RNG system, just roll with the punches and work with what you get.  Ok, if you are still interested, then the game does have other elements to it besides random dice rolls. You can use research cards with special abilities that help. Each module on the ship has a special ability that can be activated, and there are random events that occur in between turns that have choices that can help and hinder you. Your crew also have a different special ability each.  There is a easy and quick tutorial, gameplay is pretty straight forward and does not vary much throughout the game. You will get random events that you need to roll dice to resolve. These events themselves can be many different random things, but besides the random hazards, they all are resolved the same way by rolling dice. Hazards can be putting your dice in 'stasis', 'voiding' your dice, and causing injury to your crew if you roll the number associated with the hazard.  The dice themselves represent your crew members 'energy'. They can eat food or use abilites or cards (research) to get more dice. With no dice (energy) the crew will not be able to fix the ship. The ship itself has a health bar as well and when it takes too much damage from events not being fixed it will fall apart and its game over. Another mechanic that comes into play is crew stress levels. The higher the stress, the crazier the crew member gets and possibly worse consequences will follow if they do not destress.    I tried to cover as much as possible. Overall I find the game to be interesting and fun. It does get somewhat repetitive after playing it for a bit, but I am still having fun playing a round or two every once in a while. I am also excited to see what the developers will offer for DLC and patches.   Its fun and I would recommend the game to anyone who loves to play dice. I also like the space theme too so that helps some. Good game for the price in my opinion. Good Luck!!",

            "review_text": "There's a special class of games that I've taken to calling 'risk management' games. These were pioneered by the XCOM series and, more recently, popularized with Darkest Dungeon. Whereas most games are wholly or mainly skill-based, risk management games lay your fate at the mercy of the random number gods. This isn't to say they don't take skill into account, but rather that skill plays a very different part in winning.  I'm yammering about this because Tharsis is a particularly vicious risk management game, and if I'm going to recommend it then you need to know what that means. Tharsis is the story of the unluckiest expedition to Mars ever, even moreso than Ice Cube and his crew. A signal has been detected on the Tharsis plateau of the red planet, and en route to investigate the ship gets hit by meteorites. This destroys the supply stores, kills two of the crew, and gets you through the tutorial and into the action. If you've ever seen the film Sunshine, you'll feel right at home.  The action here, mind you, is dice rolling. You have 10 weeks to survive to reach Mars, and every week a host of problems crop up on the ship. Each of your four remaining crew members can move to a problem and try to fix it, by rolling dice and trying to beat the value of the disaster. Dice roughly translates to stamina in this game, each of the crew can have up to five dice to roll but deploying them each week costs one die for the following week. Dice can be used for other actions as well, as each section of the ship has a different purpose like restoring dice or repairing the hull. Your crew also has special abilities that can be activated with a die at 5 or 6, and there's a research system where you can bank one of each die value to spend on special effects. Most crew members get one re-roll per turn as well, and dice can be held between rolls if you like how they came up but need to see how things shake out before spending dice.  As you may have gathered, there's a ton of simple systems that add up to a wide array of interconnected options. And you'll need them all, because the situation is often stacked against you. Disasters can take over 20 points to resolve, and wreck your ship if you fail to reach the quota. Disasters can also put special effects on rolls like injuring crew or deleting dice (which can be countered by Assists granted by yet another ship system!). And if you don't address a problem one week, it carries over to the next. Your crew also has health and stress to manage, killing them if the former bottoms out and making them dangerous an unpredictable if the latter gets too high. Between weeks there are also trade-off choices to make, usually between health, hull, stress, and dice. You can also grant food rations to restore dice, or resort to cannibalism if you're desperate. I haven't tried eating my crew yet, but it adds a nice bit of flavor (heh heh) to the game.  The fact that all of these options are limited by dice rolls is the key. It would be simple to work out plans and assign resources if all of your actions were of static value. But you will absolutely have situations where you send a crew with five dice to resolve an 8-point problem, and they roll all ones. This is where the risk management element comes into play, because you're not playing to solve every problem. You're playing to minimize your losses and prepare for the worst. Sometimes your crew is going to fail you, and it's going to mean someone will die, and the challenge will be finding a way to mitigate the damage and soldier on. There are no perfect runs in Tharsis, and that's the way it's meant to be.  For people rubbed the wrong way by that, a recent patch DID add an easy mode that I managed to beat on my second attempt ever, so I imagine it's balanced around being very beatable. My first attempt at normal was also a success, but the second spiraled out of control in a way that I'm not sure I could have recovered from. I don't know if every game is winnable or not, but I'm also enjoying learning and experimenting until I get to the point that I can determine that. You can unlock additional crewmembers to use, along with spookier portraits for them. There are also ten challenge scenarios to attempt as well, so it's not like I'll run out of people to kill or ways to kill them.  The presentation is polished and inviting, with fully 3D ship dioramas and horrified crew to enjoy. The menus are equally clean, with clear buttons and descriptions of what they do (a must in a game like this). Sound design is appropriately somber and technical, striking just the right tone for eating your shipmates so you have the strength to stop the fire in life support. In the end, the only question that really matters is, do you have the patience for a game like this? There is skill to the gameplay, but moreso even than XCOM or Darkest Dungeon your success is measured in how far the dice rolls will go to meet your skill. Sometimes you're going to lose, and you'll feel helpless in the face of annihilation. If you're not cool with that, give this one a pass. But if you want to tax your problem-solving skills, and live on the razor's edge of a dice roll, Tharsis delivers the goods.",

You have a limited crew and have to deal with continual problems on the ship. The problem is that not only is it difficult, but it does not allow you to make best use of your resources. Your starting crew will have random health and dice, dice determining how many dice they roll on their turn. Solving events requires a certain number from the dice, and you can use them for other benefits if you resolve the events early.   Problems:  -Unsolved issues persist until the next turn despite doing damage or causing problems, so problems compound and snowball. Missing one event pretty much = game over  -Interesting concepts if crew die, but crew death = game over because you won't be able to fix the problems on later turns.  -'Assists' which save you from bad effects when rolling are used automatically, so they can get wasted when you might want them later.   -Dice can't be removed from some slots even without passing the turn, so you can't change your mind.  -Story seems cool, but is revealed on later turns and you will keep seeing the same bits over and over as you struggle to progress.   There is a foundation here for solid tactical decision making, but these other elements keep it from seeming fair and being fun. I requested a refund even at that low price.",

            "review_text": "Guys. Hey, guys.  If you have any doubts about this game because of the raging fearmongers who tell you it's impossible and that its RNG is broken, bla bla bla...  Please, look at my profile. Look at my Achievz for this game:  Got to Mars Most of Crew Intact (Captain went down with the ship) Didn't Eat Anyone IN 3.2 HOURS  Let me explain exactly what's going on here.  Tharsis has a VERY steep learning curve at the beginning. You're scrambling to put out 800 fires at once, and you only have enough energy to put out... 2 of them. The game forces you to squash immediate threats to your survival while you scramble to create even the slightest semblance of long-term stability. It also forces you to be verrrrry meticulous about the placement of crew, the use of modules (different locations aboard the ship), and the distribution of dice.  As the developers explained in one of their videos, you shouldn't be fooled by the apparent arbitrary nature of the dice... No, you don't get to choose what numbers come up, but you DO get to choose how to apply them, and that makes ALL the difference in the world. If you're using the right character in the right ship module, or choosing the right research option, what may look like a handful of lousy rolls can easily be turned around into game-changing effects that're even more powerful than straight rolling against the target numbers of various emergency tasks that you have to deal with. Examples:  * If you're in the Maintenance Bay, a pair of snake eyes can counter crippling damage elsewhere on the ship while someone else is whittling away at those repairs.  *If you're in the Laboratory, you can reset the ship's Assist which blocks hazardous dice rolls, protecting the rest of your crew from lethal injuries while they work elsewhere on the ship.  YES, YOU WILL FAIL! MULTIPLE TIMES! Don't be discouraged. I think my first 3 playthroughs lasted a combined total of about 15 minutes... When you still don't know what you're doing, getting smoked takes minimal effort and it happens in the blink of an eye. It may be 5 games, 10 games, before your experience starts to feel more like progress and less like surprise buttsekz, but the good news is that those first few rounds will probably fly by too quickly for you to dwell on them. And slowly, steadily, you'll get further and further along on your voyage.  All of your crew members have unique abilities, and there are different ways to play with each of them, and other unique crew that unlock after various achievements... and then the sheer randomness of the game itself, as well as a higher difficulty, all add up to a fair amount of replayability for the truly masochistic. Apparently they also have additional 'Missions' of an undisclosed nature coming down the pipe as well, so there'll be more places to fly to in the future. For now, getting to Mars is scary enough on its own.  If you don't own Tharsis yet, I'd offer the same caveat as some other folks have..... This game is not for everyone. On a scale of 1 to Completely-Dank, you probably need to be at least a 7 to be successful here. If you went to one of those schools where everyone got a gold star just for showing up, you probably won't have the temperament that's required for a mission to Mars.  If you already own the game and don't like what it's doing to your self-esteem, my advice would be to really experiment with your crew and with the various modules aboard the ship, as well as research options, rather than just trying to grind away at one emergency after the next. You'll get a better feel of what you're truly capable of, and you'll see a lot more depth to the game than if you just keep throwing bodies at each new problem as it arises. With luck and practice, you'll probably even survive.  My only complaint right now is with how short the game is... If and when you do figure it out, 10 turns go by really quickly. I'm hoping that the higher difficulty and the upcoming missions stretch that out a bit.  8/10  UPDATE: The Stress mechanic adds a lot to the game's replayability, and takes most of the sting out of losing when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan by adding a dash of humor. Your crew start to make hilariously incredibad life choices once they go over the edge, complete with colorful commentary.",

At the core it’s a resource management game, where your characters must perform repairs in different sections of the ship. Each “run” takes anywhere between 10 and 40 minutes, based on how soon your team is wiped off by explosions, leaks, fires and various safety hazards. The goal is survive with at least one team member for the whole ten turns, and that’s quite the challenge.  PROS: + The game mechanics are quite simple, and there are 10 missions that represent excellent tutorials to learn how to deal with various issues that will have to face during the campagn (that is the full ten turns). + Making the best of your dice rolls, prioritizing and strategizing is no easy task, and requires some good thinking. + Graphics and size are functional for a game of this tiny dimensions. + The various characters you unlock by playing have unique features, and even coming up with the 4 chosen ones require some good thinking on the player’s part as each interact differently with the others. + While each “game” is very quick, there is strong replayability value here, especially if you want to get all the achievements, and you will want to. + At 2.50 is a steal  CONS - The game is unnecessarily challenging. Read it like this: “Easy” is actually (tough) normal mode, “Normal” is hardcore (you might make all the most sensible decisions and still lose), “Hard” is damn impossible.

I got it in a bundle and as soon as I get all of the trading cards I will be promptly hiding it from my game list with the hopes that I'll never think of it again.  This game could be okay, if it weren't terribly unbalanced. I'll start off by saying that I hate games based solely on RNG, and this game certainly falls into that category. However, if it were only that it might still be fun. But it's not, it's far more flawed than just that.  I played about 10 games on EASY mode. Easy, right? Wrong. On about half of the playthoughs, I barely made it past turn 2 or 3 out of the 9 turns required to beat the game. I'm pretty good at most strategy games and I understand the strategy elements of this one clearly, but when they just keep throwing insane obstacles in your path, there's no way to beat it.   For example, on turn 3 I got a room that had 19 difficulty and another room that was 18 difficulty and a 3rd room that was 12 difficulty. That means that you need to roll that much on your dice in each room to clear the problems there. Each character can have 5 dice max and lose 1 die every turn that you use them. So with 4 characters at 5 dice each (almost impossible to have) you roll 20 dice. At 3.5 average per roll, you end up with 70 total difficulty rolled on average. You only need 49 total to clear all three rooms, so that's not to hard, right?   Wrong again. Because the 19 difficulty room also automatically destroys any dice that you roll above 3.... Like, they are gone, don't go towards the total rolled and you can't reroll them..... SO even if you rolled all 3's across the board (again, almost impossible) it would take 2 of your 4 characters to clear that one room. Then you would need nearly perfect rolls to clear the other two rooms with your two remaining characters (again, almost impossible). Those rooms also have hazards that injure you or destroy dice or stop you from rerolling dice when you land on certain numbers, even further lowering your chance of actually clearing the problem.  Any of those rooms that you don't clear the problem either damager your players, take dice away from them, damage your ship (which loses you the game if you take 5 damage the whole game and just one room missed does 1-2 damage to it). On top of that, the game just keeps adding 2-3 more damaged rooms every turn regardless of how many rooms you did or didn't clear. So they just keep piling up with no way to ever realistically clear them all, or even the ones that are absolutely needed to survive.  Keep in mind, all of this is on EASY mode.... Yeah...   ",

You are on a knife edge of survivability on every turn, and all it takes is a bad RANDOM dice roll, or a bad RANDOM deal of the research cards, or a bad RANDOM series of turn disasters and you are stuck in a situation where the only option is to quit and restart and there is no way the game mechanics can get you out of the situation, and that's just BAD design in my book, and to be honest I cannot see what the developers could do to resolve the issue. All this talk of 'fate' is being a game apologist, this game is not balanced correctly. It is stacked to make you lose, but the kicker is that on the rare occasions you do win there is no sense of accomplishment as YOU haven't won, you just got lucky. Untimately you have as much control over your survival in this game as if the game was flipping 4 coins and you win if all 4 are heads, its just that the game takes longer and wraps it in pretty graphics, but untimately your influence on the ultimate outcome is just as minimal.  I DON'T HATE THIS GAME (HOWEVER IT COULD BE IMPROVED) REVIEW 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You know what, most of the things I said above still apply but one major factor changed, how I approached the game. View the game like a card game of solitare, most of the time you are going to lose and a lot of the time that is due to how the cards were dealt, don't dwell on it, just swear, and restart the game and try again. This game should be viewed as a pleasant little 15 minute time waster, and nothing more, don't look for hidden greatness 'cos it isn't there, what you see if what you get. The more games I played, the more I started to get familiar with the mechanics (yes I don't need to try and stop that event as I can take the two damage this turn, and instead I can use the time I would have wasted to generate food that will give me +3 dice, and also regenerate another crew member's dice in another module so that next turn I am fully equipped to tackle it, and cycle some research cards, I might get some nasty random cards next turn, or I might not, I'll play it by ear), and realised that whilst the game is still 60% random, the other 40% strategy you have gives you just enough wiggle room to potentially tip things in your favour. You can still get totally obliterated by a set of unlucky dice rolls and random events, I've has crew members die from 4 health in one die roll in 3 different game (if you lose a crew member then just restart, no point in going on, don't make yourself suffer unduly) but the times that you do influence events it does give you a good feeling.  The narration is very well acted, but it become old and very repetative after just a couple of playthroughs, it would be nice to have multiple little 10 segment stories that changed completely every time you won a game. In addition it might be helpful for people that would otherwise hate the game to have a set of 'strike' cards that you could use to totally cancel an event, and you could set how many of these cards you got (maybe 1-3) at the start of the game, so you could play enough to understand all the mechanics of the game at your own pace, and slowly wean yourself off by reducing the number of strike cards you got deal until you were finally in a better mental position to have the full punishing Tharsis experience. Finally they need to sort out how they generate the random events as I don't believe they are properly balanced, far too often you can get events with 26+ costs that also include 3 dice of injury or void even on normal difficulty and it's nearly impossible to survive multiple occurances like that, there is a difference between being hard and being unfair.",

            "review_text": " What is it?   Tharsis is a space-themed strategy game where the outcome is heavily based on rolls of the dice and your ability to manage the results. It combines strategy from old school dice games, like Yahtzee and Farkle, with space themed crew survival ala FTL.   What's good?     The game is very easy to get the hang of. It only takes a couple runs to understand the features and abilities. There's also an easy mode now for beginners.     There are many different ways to prioritize your dice rolls leading to separate strategies each run.     The game itself looks and runs great! I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches yet.     Games are pretty short (20-30 minutes each). While some may not appreciate this, for a luck based game, it suits it well and doesn't drag on.   What's not so good?     While you live by the dice, so do you die by the dice. Sometimes you can manage your best and still come out defeated. Such is the way of an ultimately luck-based game.      The story is very short and the same for every game.   Who is this game for?   This game would be best served primarily to people who can enjoy a quick strategy sim but don't get upset when they lose. You will not win every game no matter how good you get. This game is also great for those with not a lot of time to play other, larger strategy games like Civilization.   Concluding Statement   Despite the mixed reviews, this is a very fun game! I feel like the developers did a very good job of spicing up the dice genre while keeping it simple. I'm guessing most of the bad reviews come from people who did not research enough about what they were getting or didn't quite understand what kind of gamer they were. If you're in it to win it, don't get this game. But if you can appreciate the randomness and then try to work with the consequences, I think you can enjoy this game.",

It's challenging, but by no means as brutal as many other games. Once you get a hang of the game and its systems, even hard mode is quite winnable. I played through Easy once, Normal twice, and Hard about three times with a win rate of 50%. After that, I had unlocked all the characters but one and there's not much point to playing again as you've seen it all and it gets very repetitious. The last unlockable character requires a giant leap in plays (about 3 times as many as I did) and is too grindy to be enticing, although it is the best character.  The missions - which I thought would breathe new life into the game - are actually so poorly done that they suck the soul out of an otherwise very fun game. They generally follow the pattern of 'do everything exactly the way the mission designer wants you to and make every die roll perfectly' which is the opposite of the base game. In the base game, if a roll doesn't go your way, it's almost always recoverable. Even losing a crew member late in the mission isn't necessarily an automatic end because of cannibalism. The missions are completely inexcusably bad. They are the bare minimum amount of effort a developer can put forth and actually detract from the game rather than enrichen it. The skull avatars are equally distracting.   It seems like they must've moved on to another project and sent the interns to work on the 'big update' instead of putting in a good effort. Don't let it entice you into thinking otherwise.  Overall, absolutely not worth full price. It's good to great for a couple hours. As long as you know that going in, it's a recommend. Otherwise, there's too little meat on the bones to actually recommend.",

It's been compared to a board game because of the dice and UI, but for me the best comparison is a roguelike game that focuses on survival rather than fighting. As in a roguelike, the path to success hinges more on discovering what kinds of problems to ignore or brush past for the time being, and what kinds of measures you can take to last as long as possible during future problems  The dice can be very unkind, so it's a good thing they look and sound excellent! It is legitimately fun to throw the dice, even when you're sweating bullets because you're about to make a life or death throw. Additionally, the soundtrack is the perfect ambient compliment for this game. I found it stuck in my head so much that I bought the album it's taken from immediately.

            "review_text": "I don't think Tharsis is nearly as random as the dice rolls would have anyone believe. It's more that the systems and solutions available to players are not all immediately obvious. Mashable's review said it best when they complained that 'the game doesn't do a great job of preparing new players for the trials to come', and I agree wholeheartedly with that.   You can let a problem go unaddressed one round, damaging your ship by 1 damage, because you've set your engineer up in the maintenance room and his rolls bumped the ship's health up by 3. You can improve the sustainability of your crew by having one in the cockpit room to remove movement damage when you have crew in less-than-ideal positions for some challenging problems. Being aware of your assist count going into a challenge, and prioritizing problems with damage or void modifiers for your assist usage can mean the difference between life and death.  Ultimately, this game does a great job of creating a very rigid, parseable system to play in and an even better job of making you feel like every decision counts, because they do. I'm reminded of games like Darkest Dungeon when I play, and for me, that's a really good thing.

There are a handful of resources to manage in this game: the ship, morale, food, and indirectly the positioning of crew members. The most important resource, and perhaps unfairly way too important, is food. Every other resource is most efficiently gained with excess food by spending excess dice on the locations and this isn't communicated too well. Eat immediately and generate food on your first few turns, even if you have to leave a crisis, and the rest of the game is easy as you'll be able to keep every crew member above 3 dice.  The game is not impossible and I tentatively recommend it for presenting themeatically brutal choices. Replayability is also a large concern, as it appears weak with a dominating strategy. The balance can be made more dynamic, perhaps easing up when necessary, and increasing if not. My first win actually had all crew members survive with 0 stress, full bellys, and even a fully repaired ship.  The risk management is mostly fine, the only thing that screams unfair RNG is rolling injury hazards.

Obviously Tharsis has a very strong RNG component, and if RNGod decides you're dead.. well, you're dead!  But it's not completely random: bad luck can be mitigated by direct means such as 'assists' that cancel negative outcomes of particularly bad rolls, but since it's all based on a 'resource allocation' mechanic, it's primarly YOUR strategy that can (but not always will) make the difference. Putting that low dice on research can save your life the next turn, or maybe deliberately ignoring a hazard and choosing to allocate good dice to activate a crew member's or ship's ability can later reward you. Long story short, most of the times I lose a Tharsis run I cannot feel crushed by RNGod because I realize that 'If I played those dice in that other way I could have won'.

The idea of the game is you have four crew members with different abilities and your job is to maintain a space ship. What you do on your turn is select a crew member, go to a location and roll your dice. You then do one of four things. First you can attend to a disaster, and if successful in stopping it, prevent its consequences from happening the next turn. However disasters often come with penetly for rolling certain dice, that could lock them, remove them from play or even hurt the crew member. You can active the special ability of the location, granting perks/health/dice to the crew. You can activate your crew members special abilities, a perk that they can use in any room they are in. Finally you put your dice into research and, if you have enough points, grant small perks to help you survive.  Generally you won't be surviving though. And it's not the randomness of the dice rolls that will kill you, it is the randomness of the disasters that plaque your ship that will get you. Sometimes you'll get three terrible events that even if you rolled/played perfectly, you will die.  Don't let that be discouraging though. The game is fun, and you can quickly start again.

            "review_text": "This could be a fun little game, great for wasting time and lazy play, but it's not.  Random Number Generator games (this one has the numbers vizualised as dice) are generally unforgiving. Next to no skill is required to play them because everything is random.  This game requires some skill, because you have to manage people, food, abilities, repairs, and upgrades. Other than that, it's Yahtzee with a space theme and some artificially injected tension.  I played through 3 or 4 times, and I actually won my first time. Before anyone starts yelling that it wasn't enough time for the game to get good, no game should take over an hour to get to the good stuff. Especially not a short, repeatable dice game.  As far as RNG games go, this one is less forgiving than most. The deck is stacked against you from the beginning, and it only gets worse from there.   The first thing you do is lose 2 people. Then you have to make the rest of the trip with only 4 people. Every turn, 3 or 4 modules break down or are damaged.  Every. Turn. You must then move your remaining people around and roll the dice to see if you can make up the number required to fix whatever is wrong. When you roll each turn with a character, it reduces the number of dice available for that character's next turn by 1. If you're lucky, you won't run out of dice-repleninshing food until turn 3 and can make it to the hydroponics lab without being killed. Once you get there, you'll need at least 2 matching dice to harvest any food, once you fix whatever problem is occurring by adding up dice to get whatever number is assigned to represent the problem. Hopefully you avoid rolling any of the penalty numbers, which can cause character damage, loss of dice, or locking dice at low numbers. Once you fix/harvest, if you want to activate your character's ability, you'll need to have a 5 or 6 left over to drop into that (some of the abilities are good, some are useless).  Also note that, in addition to fixing problems to avoid your spaceship being destroyed, you'll need to deal with stress (your people will screw stuff up if you don't take care of it), feeding your people so that they have dice to roll, and the mini-events between waves.  I need to take a moment to talk about these mini-events. These events normally involve sacrificing something to get something else, like 1 die from 2 of your people to repair a point of hull. The rub comes in when the choice you didn't take (because it was sacrificing 2 food to regain a point of health for the other 2 characters, who have almost full health) causes your other characters' stress level to go through the roof, making them completely unreliable for the next turn (or until you can find a way to reduce it).  If you run out of food, you can have your people cannibalize the dead crew member preserved in the Med Lab. This will give your characters some of their precious dice back, but it costs them a point of health. PERMANENTLY. Since each character only starts with 6 maximium health, this is a big deal. If you are forced to cannibalism, you are punished heavily. This wouldn't be a big deal if your whole pantry of food wasn't destroyed in the prologue.  The concept is good, but execution is poor. Too many things break each turn to be able to fix them all, gather any sort of supplies, and heal your characters. Maybe I missed the memo that told me that I was supposed to lose almost every time, but if that's the case, then the concept isn't even good.  This game has very little replay value other than unlocking a few new characters with different abilities, unless you're a glutton for punishment. There is no 'changing' the odds, because the game is too heavily stacked against the player. The game seems to be trying for rogue-like (given the endless repeatability), but it fails miserably.

I would compare this game to Elder Sign (a game I love), except that Tharsis has more choices with more signficance to make. Similar to Elder Sign, each character rolls dice and then allocates the dice to fend off certain doom. After each character goes, then the game takes it's turn and terrible things happen to you. Also similar to Elder Sign, characters move from location to location, each location having an effect on how you can use your dice and what positive results you will get for defeating it. This game is not totally luck based. There are a lot of choices to make with your rolls or you can press your luck and re-roll. I am loving this game and would buy a physical version if they made one. So, if you like punishing board games like Ghost Stories, Space Hulk: Death Angel, Elder Signs or Defenders of the Realm then you will like Tharsis.",

This happened to me after the 2nd week, and at that point it was IMPOSSIBLE to win the game, because the amount of events stays the same and the game mechanics allows you to fix 1 per crew member, so if you get 3+ events there is NO WAY to clear them all with just 1 crew member. That is a not well thought through game mechanic, and it's basically game over if u ever get left with one crew member. Every game should give you a sense of hope, the feeling that you can win even the odds are bad, this should be reflected by the mechanics as well...Tharsis doesn't do this. Second thing i'd like to add is that after finishing the game and hearing the story i have no desire to replay it i.e. the replay value of the game goes waaaay down after you beat it.",

If you do, what makes this game better than others with the same mechanics is the attention to detail graphically, and the art style of the cut scenes is wonderfully paired with the voice acting (notice that the narrator changes if your captain dies). The whole story is very well paired with the mechanics. All in all, its a game to get in any sort of sale, and maybe even without one, if you like board games, or theme of space horror.  EDIT: I was shocked at how many negative reviews there are. Most of them seem to be about how unbalanced the game is. And its true, as any game with randomly generated obstacles, it will sometimes hit you exactly where your team is weak. Still, I'd suggest that you dont blame the game for your lack of knowledge about dice odds. I deeply believe that making the game easier would make it worse.",

The dead astronaut is in fact the one who gets ejected into space in the beginning of Tharsis.  At the end of Laserlife, the alien understand the hardship and the sacrifices the humans endured, and since Tharsis also feature a metaphysical alien at the end (with one ending ending with the sentence 'The anomaly... It knew'.), then it means that they are a single entity. So now, it would mean that they tried to make the humans survive no matter what, because that's what humans would do isn't it? Putting them in an infinite loop of suffering, but with the hope of surviving at the end. But since endless suffering isn't something human they chose to destroy the anomaly at the true end, sacrificing themselves but putting an end at that loop.

It's not worth it's asking price, especially when there's no extra features in a game that can be beaten in 1 to 2 hrs if you're lucky enough.  Rating: D-",

            "review_text": "I regulary play many games in real life that involve dice rolling scenarios in games such as DnD and warhammer 40,000.  This game is not like that. Every turn 2 or more complications arise on the ship that sometimes require a combined roll of THIRTY or more to fix. In each game you start with all of your crew members with only 2-3 dice and usually 2-3 health out of 6. I stopped playing when my med bay broke and it would wound a crew member on a role of 4, 5, or 6, the module would deal 3 damage to my ship this turn if it wasn't fixed, and it required a combined roll of 25 to fix. THIS IS ALL ON NORMAL! This game was not made to be possible. I had managed to play 15 sessions and every one of which has played out the way I have described.   To my knowledge there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY to prevent a massive amount of malfunctions on the ship from occuring each turn. This game tried to make itself difficult like FTL was and instead just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off and not in a good way.   Simplistic rolling with many different ways to hamper your ability to re-roll dice seriously hamstrings and possibility of fun. A malfunction can roll three different types of debuffs for your dice: stasis, void, and injury.   Stasis: You can't re-roll a die that matches the number that the malfunction rolled. This one is not the problem with this game.  Void: Any rolls matching the number that the malfunction rolls will be discarded and you are not allowed to re-roll or save those dice in any way.  Injury: Any rolls matching the number the malfunction rolls will injury the crew member rolling the dice, dealing 1 damage. (As I stated before whenever you start, almost all of your crew members will only have 2-3 health out of 6)  The problem is that you can get high combined roll malfunctions with void, stasis, and injury that damage your ship by two at ANY point in the game. AND THERE COULD BE THREE OF THEM! The game was not made to be possible. End of story.",

Extremely fun, with tactical decisions, and of course dice-rolling. I love dice rolling. Can it screw you? Yes, there will be games where there is no hope in about 2 minutes. But the gains you get from this core feature are immense.  It creates small victories where you got that one roll to put out a fire or heal your Engineer. And the game is NOT BRUTALLY difficult. It took me 3 hours to land my whole crew on Mars, and it was a lot of trial and error to get there. Now I am not quite ready for hard mode, but the replayability is there to keep trying for a high score while unlocking new crew. Plus there will be future content and missions, which only add to the game's already present value.  If you like science fiction, simulation, board games, dice-rolling, or just knowing the option to eat your useless doctor who kept rolling 1's constantly 6 weeks in....this game is worth every penny. Easily. Want a hint to win? If you didn't know who said the quote I started the review off with (Shame), its Admiral Adama from BSG.

This inevitably results in some negative reviews by players who can't deal with the reality of rolling triple 2s at the wrong time. The mixed reception can be directly related to this phenomen. It is also rather challenging on normal and especially hard difficulty, but that makes success all the sweeter.  The game itself is a mixture of single player boardgame and puzzle. The two game modes are specific missions or a 'regular' run. The missions put you in increasingly challenging situations which you need to hack through with planning and the luck of the roll. The regular game mode gives you 4 astronauts whom you need to assign to various potentially catastrophic failures in their space module until they reach Mars (which is about 10 turns). There are 4 'classes' at the beginning and you get more as you progress with the game's achievements. The astronauts have a maximum of 6 health points, a max of 5 dice rolls and their special ability. They use their dice pool to fix an issue in a module which have a certain number of points that needs to be reduced to 0 in any turn or their negative effect will apply. These effects can be hull point loss (spacecraft) or health loss, food loss or module failure (you can't regain health in the medical bay for example until you fix the malfunction). There are other features that make the game more refined, I don't think it's necessary to list them all, they work good. :) The basic rules take very little to understand, and the more wily tricks can be learned in about 10 hours (the missions help with that learning). Basically you are given a random puzzle each turn and it's up to you how you solve the spacecraft's malfunctions.   The game's concept is rather unique and the delivery is simple and effective. Anyone who actually LIKES dice games and their fickle nature should enjoy this game. The developer team is also very dedicated and takes the players' wishes into serious consideration and react on a short notice (reintroduced 'normal' difficulty, new 'easy' for example). Don't be turned off by the host of negative reviews, this game offers you a 30 minute creative refreshment any time you want to roll some dice.",

The problem is that your ability to win or lose is essentially random, there is almost nothing you can do to prevent your death if its coming. The reason for this is the game is random, and by random I mean everything(with one important exception) is random and therefore there is nothing that you can do to get on a firm ground. Take FTL for example of how this is done right. Nearly everything you encounter in that game has a counter be it diplomacy, having the right crew member, or just jumping away. Sure you can get in a hopeless situation, but often it is of your own making. In Tharsis you can be on top of the world one turn before only to end the next watching the ship fall apart due to situations you had no way to counter. There is no 'risk reward' mechanic that FTL and Pandemic give you, there is only the hard random rolls of the computer in deciding if you are going to be allowed to advance or not.

            "review_text": "It wants to be like a hard rogue-like, like FTL, but misses the mark.  The basics are this:  Each turn random events affect different ship modules. Each event has a repair rating (I've seen as low as 7, but most are in the teens, some in the 20's) and if not repaired by the end of the turn each event will damage the ship or crew.   While an event is active, there may be effects on certain die rolls. Stasis freezes a die so it can't be rerolled, Injury does a point to the crew member and Void destroys the dice so they can't be used. For instance, if Stasis (1) and Injury (3) are listed, then any ones can't be rerolled and every three that is rolled causes a point of damage to the crew.  You stop the event by sending crew to the module, rolling their dice and spending them. If you put enough points into the repair to match it's rating then the event is repaired. Repairs carry over, so even partial repairs can help.  Also, each module has an ability that can be activated by using on or more dice (growing food, healing, reducing stress, etc).  It all sounds very cool. Sounds like there's lots of potential, but implementation is awful.  You have a limited number of 'Assists'. Assists allow you to ignore Stasis, Injury and Void results. Here's the thing though, they are AUTOMATICALLY used. No decision making involved. Even if you're fine with a die (or dice) locked by Stasis the Assist(s) get used. Instead of giving you a limited resource you can use at the best moment, you get a limited resource that's automatically used - so much for tactical decision making.  The totals needed for repairs are over the top compared to the total number of dice you can expect to roll.  The fifth turn (halfway point) added three events that required 64 repair (26,24,14) and would do 7 damage (2,2,3) to the ship which had 2 hull left. I still had 2 events going on - a 13 that caused -1 food, and a 12 that was -1 die to all crew.  Surviving that situation isn't so much a matter of skill as luck.    canaithlydian's summary in their review was so spot on I'm just going to copy it here.  'This game would be tense, exciting, and FUN when the damage was just out of reach, where keeping the ship 'ok' felt like an accomplishment and seeing what new events came on you made for another exciting round. As it is now, the damage pours on you like a 4 year old pouring syrup on pancakes. The balance, therefore, is immature. HA!  The developers are really onto something, but they aren't finished. In my view, the balancing has to be tweaked, or this thing becomes a great idea that did not materialize.'  I'm a little less convinced that some simple balancing will make it 'great' and not just 'good' or 'ok'.

You just have to strategize correctly. Took me a few YASDs, but I'm a veteran of hard-core roguelikes. 'Die and learn' is the order of the day. After a few failures, I figured out the best way to play the odds to capitalize on favorable odds, and minimize the bad rolls as much as possible.

I post this review because I KNOW myself and the frustration of not knowing optimal ways to play difficult games in order to get the best fun out of them.  This game is VERY challenging to wrap my brain around and to effectively use the various features to get even a partial win.  The dice are like a herd of cats that got freaked out by a loud noise, . . . repeatedly.  However, in the end, whilst the game delights in withholding victory just out of reach, I'm finding the journey IS enjoyable,  albeit generally MORE attainable than the destination.  I would rate this a solid 4 out of 5 bloody dice. It COULD be a 5 . . . but the frustration factor can be quite intense.  Get a copy for your friends and then laugh at them while they play it. :-)",

Honestly the deck was stacked against this game since I'm not a fan of this genre. I got sick of of FTL's RNG mechanics pretty quickly.  Pro: Good art and graphics, voice acting is a nice addition, the repair and crew ability mechanics are awesome and I loved how the dice are use to fuel your actions. I really enjoyed the depth of the features in this game - like being able to eat dead crew to overcome famine (and have that influence the eater's stress levels accordingly). Another really fun mechanic was that at the end of each turn you pick amongst 2 or 3 actions that the crew suggest and based on that get bonuses and losses. Having to chose the lesser of 2 evils or the better of 2 buffs (based on the RNG) gives a nice level of control.  Con: The RNG is punishing and its more a matter of getting lucky when it comes to winning or losing. Normal difficulty is impossible and Easy difficulty is too easy if you have any experience in this game (or games like it). The game rounds are very short. Reason: probably that they wanted defeat to be less of a turn-off but it also makes victory seem less significant. When you start to lose, you have already lost. The mechanics of the game work in a way that makes recovery from setbacks impossible. Once you lose a crew memeber, its over. Once your crew at too low on dice (powered by food), its over. I would have liked to see the story developed more in some sort of expansion patches which add new segments to the game.  This may sound like a negative review but in reality, for the time I played this game I really enjoyed it and I could definitely see myself going back just for the interesting mechanics (at least until I get sick of the RNG again).  Is it worth $15? Nope. It's very well made but the heavy reliance on RNG makes this game difficult to stomach for long periods. I would wait until its down to $5 and then definitely pick it up.",

It's weird because this game ultimately plays very unlike a video game. Instead, I feel rather like I'm playing a digitized, re-skinned game of Arkham/Eldritch Horror, Battlestar Galactica or some other cooperative tabletop game. They use dice and/or cards to dictate success against automatically generated events. If you succeed, well, good deal. If not, often something exceedingly terrible happens. The severity of failure compared to success is usually quite inequitable.  This manner of 'tabletop PvE,' if I might translate for strict video gamers, is what I experienced playing Tharsis. Which is great. But I also felt that kneejerk reaction of, 'That's unfaaaaair!' when things took a dramatic turn. After a breather, I feel like this is my PC Gamer psyche talking, if only because I'm playing a PC game. In video games I don't expect goodwill from random number generators, but I also don't expect to release my fate to them.  In general video games allow players to win or lose depending on their own skill, be it cognitive or raw hand-eye coordination. RNGs are just darn cruel, if you observe how people react to them. Somehow this doesn't translate so poorly for tabletop gamers, who accept RNG as a sort of 'chaos effect'; Something can go very well or very wrong and we get to be imaginative enough to decide why.  Contrast aside, Tharsis is quite the gem. It promotes a deep, cynical manner of strategy that says, 'Here's attempt #1. If that fails, how can I minimize losses?' As other reviewers have said, this game is just that: Damage control. Don't be afraid to fail. Just get ready to double-down on your determination. It's not for everyone, surely, but you might be surprised how exhilirating it is once you've given it a couple whirls.  I'm proud to have Tharsis and am excited to play it again.",

The only thing I abhore about this game, though, is that it's mostly up to how lucky you get (get it?) No playthrough will ever be the same, but most will end in either your crew dying or the ship getting destroyed, so be prepared to fail a lot and dont be triggered when you do. ALSO, parents letting their kids play this game, if you are concerned about language TURN BACK NOW (OR UNINSTALL THIS.) The dialogue boxes that resemble some of the options you have in the choice phase contain f-bombs, and I know what its like since I have a little sister.

The gameplay was pretty good, but I think the difficulty needs to be re-worked. I beat the game on the second try on easy, and then on my second try on hard. The game right now relies on an appropriate amount of RNG, so I think increasing the RNG to increase the difficulty would be a bad idea, so if there was a little more micro-managing to do or something, I think it would be better.

The missions, while difficult, are not unbeatable. Not in my limited experience anyway. They will test your patience, but when you figure out the best strategy for completing them, the difficulty almost becomes a reward, so to speak. You will die. You will get angry. You will probably grip your mouse a little tighter than necessary. In the end, however, triumphing over the game's devilish design and reliance on luck is absolutely and completely satisfying.   So do I recommend this game? Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I? The game is aggravating, yes, but it's technically sound. I've encountered no bugs. The graphics are clean and pleasing enough to the eye. It even runs well on my potato of a laptop. How could I not recommend the game? If you decide to buy it though, don't thumbs down it because of it's difficulty or 'reliance on luck'.
