I'm not going to gush and give bull pros, so just take a list  Pros +Able to pick up at any time and able to play somewhere between five minutes and four hours +Tons of replayability +Difficult  +There's even a gun called the mini nuke, very powerful and it's one of my favorite weapons +Plenty of variety, to keep you playing for a long enough time +Relatively cheap +Mini nuke gun +Great menus +Innovative, you're literally a brain that goes into a suit to find its owner +Plenty of weapons to use +Not No Man's Sky +Mini nuke gun +An enemy can be you from the past life +Tons of customization +Good controls for keyboard and controller +Elite monsters are fun to fight +Loot is fun to find +There's a freaking mini nuke gun +Map feature is well integrated  Cons -About ten~ songs all lasting roughly three minutes -Game is 200~ mb, not a bad thing but kinda small for an RNG based game -No sense of progression, nothing carrying over to the next play through -Playthroughs are roughly an hour -Hardly a story, something along the lines of finding lore would be better  -Too much to use at the start of the game, 23 starting abilities and I'd rather just unlock them as I go, add some progression in the game -No pistols or sniper rifles to use -Enemies all act similar -Minions during boss fights need to go, too bothersome on a smaller platform -Too many small enemies, halve the number and buff them instead -Buff melee range by at least 1.5 -Shield ability for Fortress needs to be buffed, halve energy used or maybe cut the energy entirely and have it break over time or something -Add more modes rather than destroying reactors, maybe like just killing all of the enemies or maybe even having the special missions always be an option -Bosses and lower enemies deal little to no damage, maybe a buff or reduce player health to max of 200~ -Rare loot should be less common, and maybe buffed aswell -Maps should be smaller to reduce less areas with empty spaces -Should have an option to pick the same starting gear as the last run -Should be able to unlock skins, and you can be able to change your gear's skin at any time -Enemy that has the mini nuke -Mini nuke is difficult to find -Enemies don't shoot unless you are in their view distance which is kinda small, and their bullet range is terrible for a 'bullet hell' game     I'll add more as I go, but it's enjoyable as of now Oh and if some of these things get added I'll delete the cons ones about them     -Potato",

            "review_text": "A great mix of ARPG and Roguelike. Your a robot who is exploring randomized dungeons and you find loot that you can replace your parts with. You have eyes, a core, legs and two guns that you can customize. When you enter a level, you can choose between 3 which are different based on size, elite enemies and loot. I usually go for the most loot no matter what, its probably the best strat.  The gunplay is amazing, think nuclear throne but a lot more guns. The levels are a little unimaginative along with the bosses, but it doesn't ruin the game at all. It has the greatest trait a roguelike needs, the 'one more run' feeling. I bought it like a day ago and have already played 11 hours of it. If your a fan of ARPG's or Roguelikes, or both, I'd recommend getting it at full price. This game deserves a lot more attention.     Buy At Full Price    ",

            "review_text": "  I was given a press copy of NeuroVoider without ANY idea of what it was. I wasn't expecting much as many of the obscure/random indie games I get given for my YouTube channel are garbage. I decided to load it up anyway after looking at some of the screenshots and realizing that it somewhat resembles some of my favourite games (Enter the Gungeon, Binding of Isaac, Monsters and Monocles etc). Whatever negative preconceptions I had about this game were shattered in moments. This game is DOPE. AS. FARK.  In contrast to other similar games in the genre, you assume the role of a brain (yes, a brain) that hops into a fully customizable robot suit that you can continually change from stage to stage. You can upgrade everything from your hull, to your shields and movement tech, as well as your left AND right weapons, and boy oh boy are there a lot to choose from.   The graphics style is also on point. It reminds me of many of the isometric SNES games I used to love as a kid back in the day, except instead of the mediocre chiptune music the SNES used to crank out, you get given a serving of dubstep which seems impeccably appropriate given the fact that I've alway associated dubstep with giant robots fighting, and this is EXACTLY what NeuroVoider is. Simply put, the soundtrack is phenomenal.  This game kicks ♥♥♥. It really does.  Try it. You won't be disappointed.  As I do with all my reviews, I'll upload some gameplay footage as soon as I have a chance to record.  Cheers!",

            "review_text": "Fun gameplay. Tight controls (except for the damn ice levels...) Amazing music.   Some of the weapon types are pretty much useless, however. And 'procedurally generated' isn't as much of a selling point as it used to me. As much as there are a bajillion combinations, it still starts to feel samey after a while.   But the core gameplay loop is a lot of fun, and I would definately recommend it.",
