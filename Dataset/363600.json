            "review_text": "I do love me some management games. Why not try out one that revolves around running a weapon shop in a fantasy setting full of heroes to do quests? Well, the short answer as to why not to do just that is that this particular roll in that pile of hay is incredibly shallow and lacking in any real features, also the hay isn't actually hay, it's cheap immitation plastic hay thus covering you in horrible scrapes and injuries, like astro turf. This game, which I can't be bothered to type it's name out in full due to it being a bit of nuisance, is a rather simple management game as management games go. Never once did I find myself struggling or having made a failure of an item. I'm either the best player of this game to grace it's face, or it's not that difficult. While I take no issue with this, you more or less see everything this game has to offer in the first 30 minutes, then it expects you to continue to play for several hours to come. It's incredibly easy to earn money to keep up on the payments you have to make, especially as they're story based once you've hit certain reknown levels which can only be attained through repeated selling of items, and thus when the CRIPPLING payments roll around, they're instantly sold out as simple as passing gas. The writing is also something that I can see some peopel enjoying, it's a plethora of pop culture references, but Christ alive, it's grating as heck for me. Forced and rather strained Half-Life 3 references that left me literally howling with laughter, with 'literally' having that new modern meaning of not at all literally. Overall, it's simplicity works in its favour at times as it's a simple, easy game that you can just mindlessly burn your way through with little to no higher brain function required, put on a podcast, drink a bottle of gin and weapon smith your woes and sorrows away. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest it, unless you've got nothing better to do and a bottle of gin... and maybe some sorrows to forget. (More  HERE  [mozillogames.tumblr.com] )",

I love puns, bad puns, terrible jokes, all of it its just great to me with a cartoony design, the wiggly arms, and bad puns? You can't go wrong.  Pros - Addicting for a few hours - Potato puns - Wiggly arms - Cartoonish style - Good DLC  Cons - Repetitive - Lacks content once high level  Not much else but I'd give a positive review.",

Having been from many of Kairosoft's IOS games I would've expected more from a game of this price. But again, it is merely fan service. Although the game has funny dialouge, references to real people, games, movies, etc, gameplay seems to be no different other than the fact that you can sell your weapon from a randomly generated number of bids depending on how fitting your weapon is to the buyer.  Again, I wanted to like this game, but at this price I would wait until a sale on this game popped up (if ever).",

There is lots of management with your potatoes, each being able to level up in all aspects of the weaponmaking, exploring, merchanting, and researching proccesses. The starting potatoes the game gives you are plenty talented that hiring is not the forefront of your priorities, unlike other similar games (GameDev Story).   Like most games of this genre, you will spend some extra time getting your business up and running. I have a few hours logged and still enjoying the game. There is a balanced progression when it comes to unlocking new areas and weapons. The game does not lockout your progression if you stick to the quests given at the start, also there is no currency other than in-game $, so don't worry about the 'Mobile game pay to win' mentality about this game. Also, the need for purchasing crafting items goes out the window once you start exploring with 1-2 Taters, keeping your stock nice and full with materials, thus allowing you to keep crafting, exploring, researching, and selling.  Overall, I agree that the pricetag might be a bit much for some people. I bought this game knowing what I was getting into after reading the game's description, and I am not disappointed in the least. If $15 is too steep for you on this type of game, then hold off until it has a sale.",

As you grow you move to bigger shops and buy more advanced tools and installations.   The game is very relaxing and it has some humor in form of references to other games and movies. You will craft weapons for some well known characters look-alike / sound-alike... From gandalf to Gordon from half life 2. It's a nice touch.  I pretty much played this game from start to finish in two days, two sittings... about 20 hours including some 4-5 hours of AFK time in there. There is not much replay value, since the game is about accumulation, gathering, and growth without any real tactics or strategy that would warrant another play.

Not meant to be a graphics-appealing kind of game, but I'm a huge sucker for cartoony-styles, so this game was right up my alley. I enjoy the level of thought I had to put into optimizing my gameplay in order to maximize my revenue and rewards.

After about 2 hours of gameplay, everything is just a repetitive grind.  First off, all weapons from the same category has similar patterns of stat growths. For example, all Daggers have high speed and magic. Thus, there is a single 'Best Weapon' in any category, and if you've already had that researched, there's no real purpose in researching the weaker ones other than for completion.  Secondly, the research mechanic is totally boring. They could have made an interface allowing people to 'craft' certain weapons by combining relics, but instead they went for a no-depth waiting mechanic, where you just wait for your item to be done.  To add to that, the explore mechanic ruins the management aspect of the game. You never run out of materials anymore as long as you send your explorer out every month or so. There's no purpose in having shops around the world since your explorer gathers items for free. You end up completely drowning in materials that you don't really need.  Not to mention, some of the objectives require the player to gather a sum of money, and as soon as the player has that exact amount, the game takes it away from the player. One time, it left me completely broke that I wasn't able to pay my hired smiths on the payday.  All in all, the game had overcomplicated things that could have been simple (such as the general shop interface, the world events), and overly simplified things that could have been expanded and made interesting (such as the research, exploration, and general weapon-making mechanic). There are better games to spend your money on.",

            "review_text": "Holy Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?! Is an odd game, the title itsef is absurd. With exclamations, and a question mark you can somewhat see where this game is going. It is a simplistic 'Management' game in which you order sentient potatoes to forge weapons for you, then you can sell them, as well as have the character explore to collect supplies, and enchantments. (Which allow for stat bonuses between the four attributes of the weapons:Accuracy, Speed, Damage, and Magic, Though they don't really have any affect besides how large of a payment you recieve.) The characters though rather limitedly written were rather amusing, the gameplay itself was pretty interesting until you find all of the weapons, in which case you are just grinding until you reach the unsatisfying end of the game. The game is full of pop culture references, and to me they were used to an amusing affect. However, humor is subjective, so some, maybe even many of you would hold contempt for the writing. They definitely could've flashed out the game more, it just seems rather skeletal as it is, It is not a bad game by any means, it just feels as if it's lacking a few key qualities.  But, I am not an expert, and preference itself is subjective. So I reccommend reading the various other reviews, both good and bad, and consider their points carefully. I honestly enjoyed this game, but it did feel hollow. A better story, better variation in the potato puns, maybe try to find a way to flesh out the mechanics of the game so you don't slump into monotany near the end, and maybe a more intuitive way to upgrade various aspects of your characters, and equipment.  Would I recommend this game? No. Is it terrible? By no means, It just needs to be fleshed out.",

The tags of simulation and management are over stated for this game its more like they originally planed for this game to be a mobile game and if it was a mobile game this would be forgiveable but for the price they are selling it at it is not worth the price.  The music is okay but after a while the banging of hammers and random sounds leave you with a headache.  The game is extremely repetative and will leave you after a hour going what is the point of continueing maybe it gets more exciting end of the game but early game is very much not grabbing any sort of attention.",

The pop culture references and jokes are cute, but again, that's only entertaining enough for one playthrough. I don't find myself absolutely addicted the way I get with, say, Kairosoft games. There's no real depth or strategy here, as others have posted.  There are better management sims out there. Skip this one unless you get it on a steep sale or a Humble Bundle (pretty sure that's where I picked it up). ",

This is purely a management type game. You build weapons and then sell them to adventures/heroes to make a profit, and repeat. The major downside to this game is that it gets very repetitive and can hit that pretty quickly. But with a pretty low price you should more than get your moneys worth.",

The dog is cool, all the references to movies and games were pulled off beautifully. The ending was also pretty good, I wont spoil it though. I hope this game continues to get better and better.

Very deep tactics to crafting the wepons and expanding your smith's capabilities.   The music never gets dull and fits in with the style very well.   It keeps you entertained and progresses you to keep that sense of improvement consistant.   However this game is not absolutely perfect. The game does not seem very long (I believe I am pretty much at the highest level for everything) and this is a problem with a $15 price tag.
