Put away what you are doing and dive into this scifi adventure. Your patience will be rewarded.  PS. I was fortunate to have played Breached even before the release, thus olny 30 minutes recorded on Steam.",

And I played several versions between prototype and this release version. I need to admit that game making huge progress in visual, gameplay and narrative in each version. The most thing I love in this game is its uniqueness. It doesn't clone any known game or try to repeat well known experience. No, this game is unique and it maybe not comfortable at the beginning. I recommend to be sure that you have enough time for exploring Breached on the first launch. Don't try to come here for quick fun, please.",
