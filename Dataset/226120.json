Player has 1 ship (or later several), which flies through galaxy and explores particular star systems within limited time-frame. Some systems are inhabited and according to various circumstances player can fight, trade or help (to fight another race) inhabitatns. Game has 2 phases:    strategic movement through galaxy, which depends on local environment and also equipment;    and tactical real-time combat within a star system.   Sucessful game ending very much depends on first several explored star systems - whether player finds fast hyperdrives, items to trade, special race with generous trade offer, etc. There are several rare scenarios which occur from time to time (maybe once per 10 games), which bring another level of difficulty and fun into the game.  The interface is quite simple and also game mechanics is simple. There are several small 'gotchas', which are not obvious (e.g. it is possible to fly through blackhole if at least one ship has special equipment, or it is possible to make peace with certain race if player has certain item in inventory).",

It might just be because I've read Hitch Hiker's Guide To the Galaxy, but this game eerily reminds me of it, I have the most fun playing as a Science Vessel since it's more about exploring and collecting life from other plants as opposed to trying to fight. That's another thing, the combat in the game feels hard as ♥♥♥♥♥, I don't think I've won a single fight but, I'm not surpised really.   If you enjoy space exploration, pick up this game. It's worth the fun and there is mod support, even though I haven't tried any mods yet, I don't doubt they're probably pretty cool.",

It's quirky, and as everyone notes, a quick play to fill some time.   That said - after a handful of play throughs, there just isn't any meat here to chew on. I tried a couple short games to get the hang of it, but you can't built your ship up enough to withstand any battles, and the game is over so quickly, you better not stray too far or you'll never make it back to base in time.  Playing longer games was a more enjoyable experience. Here too though, I found it very hard to survive virtually any combat encounter.   Other than combat, all there really is, is going to each planet and putting whatever 'thing' you find there in cargo, every once in a while trading with a wandering store - presumable trading up for more points at end game. Then even at end game, there's no winning in the classic sense, just a final tally of your credits based on what you found minus what you owe.  That's pretty much it unless I'm missing something. I generally like quick time fillers, and I love quirky games, but I just can't find a way to like this one. I don't regret the couple bucks to play it a while, but I doubt it will get much replay from me.",
