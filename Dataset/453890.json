At least for me. It is a pretty solid story in my opinion though, and it is worth checking out, especially since it is free. And you can tell that the developers did put some work into this one. Good game so far. You should give it a try if you haven't already!",

This is an amazing horror game, I haven't played a game this scary since Amnesia. The story is awesome, Sullivan and Myrtle are two Fricking scary antagonists, and the events of the game got me fully immeresed right up to the end which made me happy. The only thing i truly dislike is the fact that i beat the game in less than a day. Not to sound spiteful or anything, it's just i enjoyed it so much that i wish it was longer like Amnesia. Other than that it's amazing that this is free to play, is very scary, and runs amazing on my computer. I give Black rose a 9.5/10 and recommend it for those looking for a great horror game.",

It adequetely creates a spooky and creepy environment to make the jumpscares effective without them being over the top or too numerous.   First horror game I've played since Among the Sleep, very much enjoyed Black Rose.",

It say not to look into her eyes but it doesn't give you a choice. As I was about to walk into the chapel, she just sneeked onto screen and the game ended. It gave my absolutely no chance, was not scary, and overall took the fun from the whole game. I would appreciate it if it was maybe a bit more like Slender in the aspect that the girl were to sneek behind you at times, or appear in coners of a dark room rather than the game stopping and forcing you to look at her.",
