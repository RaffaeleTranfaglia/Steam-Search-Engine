            "review_text": "10/10 Best time sink simulator for the price.  Let me preface this by saying that I have put almost three full days of playtime into this game at time of writing, so I obviously like it.  Fate is a Dungeon Crawler that came out in 2005, while the music is somewhat similar to that of Diablo, it does fit the setting and does aid with immersion quite well. The graphic are great for 2005 and can hold their own in a modern gaming market given recent events. (I am looking at you, AC Unity.)  A very basic gist of the story is this: big bad monster in big bad dungeon. Adventurous hero of unknown origin and unremarkable (non-existant?) achievement must go and slay this baddie as s/he is clearly our last and greatest hope. So off you go with little more than a pointy stick and your trusty pet compainion to try and stomp a monster's teeth in.  Every floor of the dungeon is random, in the sense that is a series of rooms with sporadic and often unyeildy connecting paths. As a whole, the entire dungeon has a nice and bumpy difficulty curve that, if you are strategic and don't mind some grinding, you can completely kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of.  I think one of the drawbacks of this game is one key game mechanic in particular. I won't be disclosing which mechanic this is, as once you figure out why it is useful, you are going to abuse this machanic like you just found out the button combination to get free soda in the soda machine at the office. Once that happens, the game loses quite a bit of difficulty. One of many things that really makes up for this is another mechanic, Enchanting, which is really more of a gamble than the actual 'gambling' mechanic.   Another thing I really like about this game are the items obtainable and the playstyles available, FATE wholeheartedly supports the idea of having your cake and eating it too, though various stat selections on leveling up, you can do just about anything, or do everything if you really want to. This is great for me, because I am the type of person that if I get a massive '♥♥♥♥ you' sword, I want a second '♥♥♥♥ you' sword or a superpowered sheild of 'I don't give a ♥♥♥♥'. And the game lets you do that! And I love that about it.  All in all, it is a great game if you are looking for something to introduce you to Dungeon Crawling, or if you are looking for something to eat up free time cheaply.",

I instantly recognized it and spent what little funds I had in my Steam wallet on it and immediately started playing. It was everything I remembered it to be and more and I fell in love with it all over again, even after all these years. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers.  Yup.

Identify everything before selling! You get more gold! This seems obvious but I would forget when I first started playing because there is soooooo much loot!  Always keep a book (or scroll) of town portal on you. It's a LOOOONG walk back to town as you get further into the dungeon. (NOTE: You'll be able to learn Town Portal and Identify spells as the game progresses. Nice.)  ",

            "review_text": "Oh my goodness. I can't believe I didn't see this game was on Steam. I LOVED This game as a kid. We got it with a whole lot of demos on a computer we bought a long time ago. The demo only lets you go to the 3rd floor of the Dungeon. Time for some personal backstory:  It was some time around 2008. I was in Elementary School still. (4th grade I think). I didn't drink enough water on a daily basis, so my bladder got infected. I started to pee blood, so I motioned for my teacher to come out in the hallway while I tell her the embarrasing news. My Mom came and picked me up. We went to my doctor's office (It was sort of like a clinic. It's hard to explain).  The doctor took me in, and told me I was going to have to get blood drawn which sent me into a panic. I had never had my blood drawn before, and I HATED needles (What kid doesn't?). So, the Doctor came in with this huge needle and stuck it into my arm. It hurt like crap. Afterwards I was really shaken up, and we ususally got toys or video games after we go to the doctors/dentists (I was into Legos at the time, so I got Lego sets for the dentist). That day, we drove to Walmart, and went to the PC games section.  It felt good to pick up that game, and put it into the cart. My mom even let me get some candy on the way out. (Some sour candy. I LOVE sour candy). Of course, I couldn't play it right as I got home. Mom had to do the checking account. So, my brother and I went outside and we sat down on a matress that was sitting outside. (It was out in my Grandma's backyard. My grandma lives right next to us. I live on a farm, btw.)  I rushed home soon, and heard that sweet sound the bank software makes when you log out; A really crunchy CHA-CHING!!! So, I sat down and put the disk into the computer. Like I said earleir, it was a long time ago and computers were super slow back in the day. So, I had to wait until the game finished installing.  Finally! It finished! Oh, that sweet song that plays at the beginning. Captain O'Kane. That song captures the epicness of this game.  The game is called Fate, you know that. You're a young adventurer with your Animal Companion (Dog or cat. You can change it later...). You arrive in the town of Grove, where the entrence to a large dungeon stand, beckoning the daring adventurers in.  You start off basic. You don't have any armor, but you do have a hachet. (Axe). I'm going to do a walkthrough on my YouTube channel, so you can get the jist of the starting.  You can fish, too! So I recommend that you buy a fishing rod and fish to your heart's content. You can sell those fish or feed them to your pet. Each fish has different effects. Let's say you feed your pet a fish, and it turns them into a spider!! All the fish you get can turn your animal companion into a Dungeon Creature, but it will stay loyal to you and fight for you.  You can chose what kind of skill you want to use. Personally I use the sword and shield the most, but I've used magic and bows too.  It's good because you can use Magic and be a swordsman, or use magic and be an archer. Magic, magic, magic.  You can get quests from certain people around town. I strongly suggest you take the quests, because they pay off well.  The main goal of the game is to find the boss of the Dungeon (It tells you at the beginning. It's always randomized too), and get rich!  I haven't actually gotten that far, but I've been to floor 100 and beyond. Which is almost as good I guess.  I STRONGLY recommend this game. It's a steal for $7.99 . I hope you liked this review of it, and be sure to find my channel on YouTube so you can watch gameplay of it, if you're not sure about it. Thanks for reading.",

Granted its not anything amazing when compared to its predecessors... but back in the day it was quite something. The fun in this game comes from the complete randomness and endless play killing waves of monsters while progressing deeper and trying to get the best set of gear you can.    It does have its flaws. Item skill point requirements are not well balanced and can make gearing up early in the game quite difficult. Fishing is almost required to get well geared, and the fishing mechanic is a bit buggy causing you to fail the catch even if you clicked in time to catch it. Perhaps the worst feature however is the chance to completely loose all enchantment on your gear when enchanting, I would not advise enchanting anything that you wouldn't want to lose... because you very well might.    I would recommend the game to anyone, it is good for at least 2 playthroughs. I'm not sure its worth the $8 price tag, i picked it up on a sale for much cheaper.",

And that spells take forever to switch, as you have to go through the spell menu, and select a spell, which can be very dangerous while in combat.  Also, the fish system is really badass.

It is a game that never ends, even after you complete the main quest (which I ahve not beat, but why would the game go 'you beat this The End.'?)Also, there are infinite levels of the dungeon. You could go to level 999999 if you wanted to. The levels are not premade, there is a system that levels up monsters for each level. So it gets forever harder ",

Made a few years earlier, it incorporates a number of things that Torchlight did, particularly the use of the pet as both a beast of burdon and as an ally which is transformable by fish. It has randomly generated dungeons, which is always nice, and has been produced well.   That said, I am finding it a bit boring. As a fighter specialising in swords, I've found most of the drops to be magic-geared, or aimed at axe-wielders. I'd say about 95% of the drops are of no interest to me at all, and this tends to make hacking your way through the levels a bit monotonous.  I'm also finding it annoying that it is all too easy to die in the game, especially if you're focusing on what's happening on-screen. The warning that health is low seems to come too late, so you end up having to divide your attention between the fighting and supervising the health bar. The pet also seems to spend about 50% of its time fleeing.  My last moan is that the resolution doesn't seem adjustable, and I'm finding that I'd like to be able to zoom out a little more and with more detail - many of the characters seem rather large and chunky, as though this game was aimed at kids.  All said though, the game is cheap enough, and I bought my copy during a sale. If you like RPGs, give it a go.",

There are many, many hours of varied gameplay available and the graphics aren't even that bad for today (Just... don't expect much out of it. It's no Diablo III). It plays like a dungeon crawler should - very variably - and is NOT a walk in the park. Overall, here's what I'd say are the pros and cons.  Pros: +Varied monsters +Varied weapons +Good graphics for the time period +Large amount of content +Difficulty scales well (Easy is actually easy, while hard is actually very hard) +No overpowered items or spells +A nice cartoony look +Very, very easy to mod with a little knowledge of Javascript and Photoshop or Gimp  Cons: -Faces look kinda messed up, limited character appearance customization -Less than stellar translations (From what I hear... I do not speak French or Spanish fluently enough to try Fate in either) -Occasionally annoying sounds (I'm definitely talking about the cat or dog. I'd recommend getting a fish to permanently transform them as quickly as possible) -Point and click style can get boring -Some... creative names can come up for bosses and for items (Like 'Zulgthar's Holy Bec de Corbin of Spite' or 'Og the Facesmasher'). -Lack of interesting spells (They're the pretty cut and dry 'Fireball' spells, 'Summon ______' spells, and 'Raise defense' spells typical of this genre. The only really interesting ones are the meteor one and the one that turns enemies to your side.) -Not for everyone. There are free trials for this game - use them. Decide if you like it or not before buying. It is dated, after all. -No online multiplayer of any kind -Not many in-game settings options -A bit of a confusing fame system. (You get skill points to spend for becoming more famous) -Some logical fallacies (Fishing in lava)  Overall, even though numerically there are more negatives, the positives far outweigh the negatives for this game. If you haven't given this classic a try, go ahead and get the demo then buy the full game if you like it. I know I did, and I know that I've sunken hundreds of thousands of hours into this immersive fantasy dungeon-crawler. (I just got it for Steam, though)",
