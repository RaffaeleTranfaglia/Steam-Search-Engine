            "review_text": "1500+ hours player.  The Good: - This might just be the best Character Creator ever in a video game, period. Just browsing the costume section of the official forums reveals just how in depth you can make a character. At the very least, this is on par with CoH. Which is to say it's incredible. Too bad the game around it is rather half-♥♥♥♥♥.  - The Freeform system is awesome. Too bad if Silver (F2P) players want to use it, you have to drop 50 whole bucks.   The Bad: - The game dosen't take its self seriously in the slightest, and (on the whole) the playerbase dosen't either. For every awesome, original player who actually creates superheroes, there's always going to be 'Themeless' characters. Everything from a outragerous, over the top, aura covered mess, or someone who colours tights to give the illusion of being naked, or someone who copies Marvel/DC creations (There's an notoriously well-known supergroup who is entirely dedicated to this). It's all there.  - The Alert System was a terrible idea. They're instanced content that can be completed in about 2 minutes. Smash, Grab, and Burst alerts give out XP, Resources, and Mods respectevly. Grab alerts aren't that bad, but the mods given out by Burst alerts are almost always useless. Smash alerts are the worst offender here, because they render the entire questing process completely irrelevant. You can aquire a reasonably large amount of XP in a very short amount of time. You can reach the level cap without even leaving the starting area. Sure, there's perks (the 713 achievments) to be had in the questing process, but perk points are like gamerscore, complely useless. They don't do anything.   - Little to no Endgame. There's raids, but they BADLY NEED an revamp. There's only about 2-3 that the community are willing to do.   - Immersion in non-existant. Remember what I said about 'Themeless characters'? They are everywhere. This extends to actual builds, Where they have summoning demons, celestial powers, calling in an airstike, a massive force of kinetic energy, mind control, and dual pistols all on the same character. They have the appearance of a hyper-anime little girl who never looses a slither of health and roflstomps everything. This is like the Iron-Skin spamming Rhino Primes in Warframe, but ten-times worse. Just try to get immersed here. I dare you.  - Zone chat is a huge cancer. Disable it immedietly. You will not regret it.    Champions can be enjoyable if you're willing to overlook the player who don't know they're playing a *SUPERHERO* MMO. You can share resources and gear between your characters, and there's no armor repair system, which I see as completly pointless and meaningless. Development has turned to an almost standstill, but both it and developer communication has started up again, and quite frequently.You might find a new virtual home here, just be prepared be disapointed in some (more that others) areas.",

Now you can buy the ability to permanently make Freeform characters (expensive and on a per-character-slot basis, oi vey) in the shop. Highly customizable character creation, but that's about as far as I've ever gotten, as being stuck with a permanently weak character for not subscribing was more of a psychological hurdle than I could personally deal with.

            "review_text": "This game stagnated. Went stale. Really stale. Cryptic sold it to PWE, and it started churning out vehicles and a bunch of reskins for the vehicles. It became lockbox mania. Every other kill, you'd get a lockbox.   Then they stopped, pulled it together, and turned the game back in the right direction: more actual content, fewer lockboxes cluttering your inventory.   The lockboxes are once again in your inventory, but they don't drop like nuts. The long-demanded purchasable free form slots are around now, at a hefty $50 but hey, we've paid more for smaller games. I should also mention, now including the adventure packs but not a few other things, the game is free. You can play through the whole thing from level 1 to 40. No experience penalties for being a free account or anything (I'm looking at YOU, SWTOR). The main drawback is that you HAVE to use an archetype, and only from a select list - you don't get to pick your own powers as you go without buying a freeform slot or paying the subscription. However, given the a large number of MMOs don't really let you pick your own powers from a very broad set, it should feel pretty normal. In fact, it's kind of nice not having to worry about all the choices, because the already large powers list has only gotten bigger over time. Start of playing for free, for sure, until you get a hang of the game.   Old updates like the 10-man boss 'Rampage' events have recently been re-done. The old teleportation glitch is still around, though. At the end of a teleport, you get slow fall for ten seconds. If you fly or teleport while slowfall is active, you will be dragged to the ground. Surely they can just make teleportation and flight powers cancel out slow fall when they're first cast... Anyways. Costumes. How badass you look will have nothing to do with your stats and will often have very little to do with special gear cluttering your important slots. There are some pieces of equipment that give you a special dark aura, or dark speed, stuff like that, but they don't take up your equipment slots. Costumes are 100% cosmetic with a quite wonderful selection even for free players. With a subscription, you get a bunch more costumes thrown in and a 500 Zen/month stipend you can go ahead and just buy those extra costumes with. And with the game's rather open lore (though it does exist), roleplay is hard to resist.   ...just remember to bring a friend into the game with you. Leveling can start too feel a little too much like a grind around the 20th time you level through Westside. And yes, I've gone through Westside that many times. Also, if you play this, tell Poe Ghost hello. He's pretty scaley. And then tell the rest of the people Poe sent you.",

Combat is dynamic, fast paced and a lot less about rotation and more about situation and play style. Obviously as F2P it has limitations. Less costume pieces, set archetypes rather then fully customised power choices and some additional content are either gold account or microtransaction accessible.  Character customisation is currently unparelled, I prefer it to City of Heroes, the only thing that comes close.  I admit that I jumped in face first, subscribing and buying a few costume packs. The gold subscription unlocks everything but a few costume bits, you even get a free token for one of the new hideouts. You can play through the game from start to endgame without paying anything and free is a reasonable price for that. Finally, there's an active Roleplaying community.  Better then the critic score gives it credit for.",

            "review_text": "(NOTICE! This game has many abilities and costume pieces you must BUY with their Real Money Currency, AKA, '0Zen' or have the super pricy Lifteme Membership to get access to. Even without those costume pieces, this game is still awesome, but just remember, You get what you pay for. And it's a F2P, or an Optional Subscription, or a Buy a lifetime of subscription)   Even though it says I've only played a few hours, I've played this game since long before it was on steam, and it was awesome every, single step of the way.  The first thing that was awesome? The Character Customization! I made a character that looks like Jack from ME2, a Karate Bird Man, A 4 ft. tall ninja, a rat called 'Cheese Inc.', a giant Robot Raptor Mech with Orange Holographic Armor, and giant metal wings. Equipping armor doesn't change your character's appearance, so you never have to worry about being forced to wear the ugliest gloves on earth, or a skirt (hint hint, Blizzard Entertainment. HINT HINT!!!)  The second thing? The Ability Customization! I have a character called 'The Everything Man'. He just looks like a normal dude with a really huge backpack. He then whips out dual pistols and shoots you 15 times, shoots a sonic arrow from his Hi-Tech Laser Bow, hits you with a fireball, summons a telekinetic sword and dices you up, then swings away on a rope. And it's a totally viable build. Also, you can change the color of your abilites, and you can even change where some come from (from a select list, not wherever you choose... so dont get any ideas...) You can shoot red colored ice shards from your chest, or green fire balls from your face, or even purple wind gusts out your fists Whatever you want.  Third on the list we have... The Travel Powers! You can swing on a rope, you can teleport, you can fly (with a cape, with giant firey phoenix wings, whatever. Its up to you.), You can tunnel underground and pop up under your enemies, you can Superjump, You can zip around the world with Superspeed. You can float about on a giant hunk of rock, or spin about in a tornado. ANYTHING!!! And all of those were just off the top of my head! Also, there are probably 6 different forms of flight to choose from, so you'll probably have one you like.  Fourth, Combat. Its fun and intuitive. At the same time (like, omg!). You can do what I did and just throw together something crazy and it'll work, or you can really read into every ability and make a crazy build that causes all kinds of combos to happen that heal you, buff you, etc. One thing that was a *SLIGHTLY* bad thing, was that enemies always fall facefirst when they die, unless you kill them with a knockback, wherein they will die face up, but it doesn't really matter that much.  Last but not least, the community. I'll give an(other). There is a guild that throws a weekly Costume Contest and rewards the winners with the equivalent of 100 Gold, and they even have honorable mentions that get 50 Gold. Crazy huh!? I know!!! And all of its in a F2P (NOTE!!! You get what you pay for, so some things will be locked off if you dont pay a subscription or get a Lifetime membership, which, last I saw, was really pricey.) But still, even the F2P version has quite a few different things you can do.  Have Fun, and Download this game!   Well, come on, do it! DOWNLOAD IT! SERIOUSLY!! DO IT NOW MON, DO IT NOW!!!",

I feel like the game is supposed to take classes into account when you reach level 10. But why not let us play starting from level 10 then?   On the same note, other games make you go to level 60, but this stops at 40. So why didn't they just strip off the first 10 levels of grinding too? Just to be sure, I want you to know that I am not complaining there aren't a million levels to grind. My complaint is that if they had the foresight to remove the last 20 level grind, why didn't they also remove the first 10 level grind too?  The worst part, is that it seems that your powers and skills are no different from anyone else playing the same class. Your personal touch is left to how your character looks. Your character's uniqueness stops once you choose your class. Basically setting your character in stone once you leave character creation.   UPDATE:",

The 'best' feature of this game for MOST players is the really detailed character creation. You can pick from literally thousands of parts/clothing options/weapons and customise them by changing their colours, details and what they are made of (most items can at least be cloth/leather/metal and some have even more choices). Characters tend to look quite unique ALTHOUGH everyone does have the same face which is a bit annoying. There is lots of freedom for making your dream hero, though.  The community itself is still generally thriving and while there aren't as many people playing as there have been in the past, the numbers are fairly steady and will probably grow as it's almost summer and lots of extra spare time will be available. Now would be a good time to join.  The game looks nice, runs well on most machines and is interesting enough to hold your attention. It's not a terribly 'grindy' game - you level up often enough that you won't get bored but it doesn't feel too fast either.  Check it out, it's free.",

Another thing about this game is it has a rp comunity.    Things that really can be annoying is the prices, not everything is free its more like swtor but better you can make zen by grinding for questnite but that takes time and its eaiser to buy with money stuff in the zen store, but another thing is they have a sub system that has benfits like unlimited charater slots, and with silver you have to buy slots, and its kinda costy and for freeform slots :( you have to use 5000 zen to get a slot for free foam and silvers have to buy some of the archtypes, Other then the costs of some of the important stuff its a good game and basically worth trieing if you want full access to all the benifits might want to go gold but you can make do with just silver.  tuff.",

Not to mention trough this many costumes the customazation is almost limitless and thats why this game is perfect for Roleplay aswell, You are most likely not able to find a thing that is exactly the same ( maybe if you pick a cheeky standard race as: demon/angel x3 ) But it still has has diffrences.

I used to play it a lot before the  On Alert  update: I loved the old tutorial mission where I got a chance to fight side by side with the original Champions. I enjoyed the story archs, the Hero Games PvP (where lots of players joined the different games) and I really liked the crafting system.  CO changed (a lot) after the update - some people say to the worse, others aren't too affected by it. The Adventure Packs which used to be Premium missions are now free, there are new missions and new features to the Millennium City map while some of the old ones are removed. I miss the Hero Games PvP-duels which are quite abandoned today since players more or less play the co-op Alert-missions instead. But in the end, it's the same game with the same Champions as before.  Maybe I'm old-fashioned because I miss the old game before the update. But I still love it. While I don't have much time today compared with 5 years ago, I think CO is one of those games which have aged well (despite its cons).  I hope that I may continue to play the game in five more years (at least) from today. It's one of the best superhero MMO where you can create your own superhero/superheroine and play as them with a keyboard.",

The problem is that it was taken over by Perfect World Entertainment, who is notorious for buying decent-but-struggling games and then running them into the ground. This is the case here. No real development, for years. No real new content. No significant fixes or balance passes. Very little new art. Just gamble boxes and regurgitated assets on the cash shop. Even the occasional new system or pointless tutorial revamp is just shuffling existing content around.  And for the love of god, don't blow your money on boxes. In fact, I'd say like 9 out of every 10 costumes, auras, powers, etc. I've ever bought with real money (or even in-game grind currency), I've been disappointed with -- ranging from 'mildly let down' to 'it just doesn't work at all'.   It's not that the core game loop isn't fun. It's that what little they do is always half-baked, broken, grindy, and nerfed into impotence. Greedy to the point of being hostile.  PWE is where games with potential go to die. I'll grant that it's better than the closest alternative, DC Universe Online. Just don't expect to find a thriving, well-maintained, developing game.

            "review_text": "This game had a lot of potential. I played all the way back into late alpha testing, when some of the forum goers were allowed to join the tests. It was a great game back then. The problem was, that the part of the community that yelled the loudest, always got their way. 'The squeaky wheel gets the oil.' Well, the truth was, that if 15 people said something one way, and 3 said it another way, but those 3 kept ranting and raving while the 15 said 'forget this, these people are just flaming everyone' then the 3 got their way. Strange, but true.  So, the game got hammered with stupid changes that made the average player unable to play at all. This gave the game a bad start, but those things got fixed. Over time, the bad start took it's toll financially, and Cryptic Studios had to switch publishers. The new publisher, Perfect World Entertainment, is notorious for the garbage they make. What's more, is regardless of what the devs may say, it's pretty obvious that the direction of the game changed pretty fast. More half-nude women, lockboxes, pay to win style upgrades and boosts, and more made their way into the game. Currently, the most powerful opponent the players can face is Gravitar, a women that epitomizes both the ditz and the... female dog... in every way they can. That means that instead of someone like Dr. Destroyer, we get a sexual icon for a villain now. This is just the tip of the iceberg, but it's one of many reasons why this game has gone down the drain.  If you want a good superhero MMORPG, you're probably out of luck. City of Heroes was killed by NCSoft's desire for more money. DCUO is great, if you want to be a sidekick. Marvel Heroes is a Diablo II clone, if you like that sort of thing. And Champions Online? Well, if you avoid lockboxes, boosts, alerts, vehicles, and anything put in after PWE took over, then it's actually a good game. Most people won't play that way though, which means I can't recommend this game. I still have my lifetime subscription that I got myself suckered into buying, though, so I'll still come back from time to time, just to have a change of pace. After all, I haven't spent a cent on this game since launch, and I still have full VIP features still. For anyone new, though, watch out. This one had potential, but it was squandered by a few really bad decisions, and now it's just another pay to win style 'free to play'.  Oh, and if you do play, make sure you study hard on the powers. Get the wrong power combinations, and you've just become the Super Wimp. So much for roleplay. =/",

It has the most tedious combat of any MMO I have ever played. All attacks auto hit, no real strategy to speak of. Just stand and button mash. In CoH you could strategize by enhancing powers with damage, accuracy, range etc. There was the chance attacks would miss. You had to be careful what to use and when. Here it's just pew, pew, pew mindlessly.  I wanted a telekinetic character. It's bloody annoying to throw one single object. Click the object, click to lift, click on target, click to throw! Click, click, click, click for one attack that won't even one shot an even level trash mob! The mechanics of this game are boring and a chore.  Most content is stuck behind the pay wall. Problem is that unlike DC Universe Online (where a sub can be worth it) you'd just be paying for a boring game rather than playing a boring game for free. I've no idea what the Marvel MMO is like but if you want to be a hero play DC Universe Online or simply mourn COX's demise.

The customes I picked were not even there. The head gear was missing so as the foot. The camera angles was the biggest issue for me. The nerves of not controlling what see is just frustrating. The camera is set to one view only and when you change it, it will just go back to one view. 3/5",

About the community ? meh not much, they are like 100-150 ( 200 in weekend ) players left in game, the amount of nudity and erotic roleplaying is too damn high, I have nothing with ppl who enjoy such things like staring to some pixels and jerking while chating about sex or other things.  About the story ? well the story is actualy not bad, even some of ideas are rip-off from DC and Marvel the gameplay is decent, if you forget the broken PVP and again the difference between silvers and gold subscribtion .... subscribtion who btw is free if you know some tricks in paypal .  Have a nice day and thanks for reading , my answer ? obviously not :D",

The community in this game pretends to be nice and loving, but the minute you say something they don't agree with, you're thrown to the curb and become a pariah.   Not to mention that the new company that took over makes it incredibly hard to reactivate your old accounts. That's a real kick in the ♥♥♥ for someone that's been playing it for years.  I'm finished with this game, the people used to be wonderfuk, you all know who you are. But the rest of you...  Community: 0/10 Graphics 5/10 Customization: 10/10",

            "review_text": "I paid for a month subscription to check out as much of the full game as I could. I spent nearly two hours building my hero, making sure not to use pieces that cost Zen (there is a large pop up in the right corner that tells you that you're using a piece that cost Zen, so it's obvious when you are). I get in game, and my entire hero is changed. Everything but base colors and the chest emblem. I log out, delete him, and start over, and now all the pieces I used now cost Zen for some reason, so I can't make the hero I want, even though I'm paying a monthly subscription fee.  So, now, I am waiting on support to give me a refund on my subscription fee (my gold subscription was open for a total of .06 days according to my account page). The rep told me he was 'reviewing my account,' and it's been over 20 minutes with no word on what's going on.  I remember when this game first came out, and it was a lot of fun. It may still be, but I'll never know. If you want access to everything, you have to pay a monthly sub fee, AND buy/collect Zen in game (and you need a LOT of Zen to unlock everything). To hell with that.",
