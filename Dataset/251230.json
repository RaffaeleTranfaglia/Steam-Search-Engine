            "review_text": "I have waited for this game for a long time and after playing it i feel somewhat let down. I must admit upon my first couple of hours i enjoyed it to some degree - i was playing solo offline to get used to the game, then however i entered a few online matches. Online Gameplay is very different, slowing down and some hideous sound clicking issues when the voice audio kicks in over the background fire etc. The part of this game i was most looking forward to is the most dissapointing of all - Survival mode, i expected some streets/arena to run around with team mates blasting and running for your life.  What you actually get in survival is the tiniest survival area i have ever seen in a game , its basically a small square of land always the same. One of the greatest problems is the game is just too easy, even on hard with unlimited continues you can just keep running through levels and eventually complete them . Gameplay is also extremely linear with a few walls you can break to reveal 'secrets' these are basically score multiplyers.    I couldnt recommend this game as i really dont feel there is enough content for Â£15 . Others may really be enjoying it but for me it was a waste of hard earned cash. As a result of the problems with the game i requested a refund from steam however as i have played 5 hours ( virtually all offline ) i cant get one. So if you decide to purchase this game play it online immediately to see if the online / survival suits you . Not happy with the game , not particularly happy with steam refund policy on this one.",

I do NOT recommend this at all to anyone. it is NOT fun. If you can't tell, this is not my style of game to play.  Every time i tried to 'respawn', or whatever you call it for this program, the enemy didn't give me a chance to rotate at all.",

Once you complete the game there is no point playing it anymore unless you find doing the same thing 2 more times with 2 different champs insteresteing.  Also make sure youve played under 2 hours of this game to get your refund otherwise youve lost your money and given your money to somone that doesnt deserve a penny.",
