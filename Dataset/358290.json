Old-school platformer with a lot of puzzles. Magnificent. Its old, i mean really old, dont expect anything like we have nowadays. A true classic that aged well.  And just because its old, it aint easy. There are some very hard segments in it.",

Not at all a bad introduction -- looking back at it over twenty years later, the 2D art and music remains effortlessly charming. The game's many chapters and levels take place across an abundance of distinct themes, which keeps the simplistic gameplay from growing stale. Put your nostalgia goggles on for this one.",
