            "review_text": "If you're looking for a metroidvania, stop, close the page, and don't look back. If you're looking for a good game, rinse and repeat. If you're looking for tedious garbage that lasts 2 hours then you've found the right place. Inescapable's page asks the questions of 'Unravel the mystery uncovered by a remote interplanetary mining operation. What did they find? What threat does it pose? And ultimately, what does it truly mean to be a hero?' None of those questions are answered.   You 'explore' this planet in what is pretty much a straight path majority of the game. Other times it will acknowledge you picked up an item and ask you to return to another previous location 10 minutes away because it happens to open a door that lets you pick up another item. You'll also occasionally complete braindead puzzles that required you pressing a switch and then continuing on your way. The creator seems to have played a Metroid or Castlevania sometime in his life and decided to make a game about it without realizing what makes those games any good.   In those games you usually picked up upgrades that had a meaningful impact on your movement or how you dealt with enemies. In this game you acquire 12 total grenades off random bodies throughout the game and a spreadshot gun that depletes your suits energy/health every time it's fired. Besides that you'll be running around with an average gun majority of the time shooting the same enemies for 2 hours. There is 3 different enemy types. There is a regular mutant, a flying mutant, and about 3 enemy soldiers you fight in the game. Take that regular mutant and change it's size and color palette and that's 95% of the enemies you will be killing in this game.   Now another one of the things that makes Metroid and Castlevania good is they include a map and each area is very distinct so you always have a feeling of knowing where you are. There is about 5 or less different tilesets in the game. Majority of them are present in the screenshots provided on the page. There's rocks, lab looking stuff, temple stuff, metal stuff, and I can't honestly think of any more. Majority of it is just different colored rocks. I think it's an accomplishment that a single guy made this, but I can't believe no one told him to maybe make the game fun or interesting.  The only thing that could be construed as interesting in the whole 2 hours would be the broken up narrative that you get from reading tablets throughout the game. It's to be believed that this planet you crashed on was being dug up and researched by some group of people we don't care about. We're to believe they found an old ancient civilization that had a secret thing no one has ever discovered. This secret thing had a lot of power and was cool or something so people wanted it. I might be wrong in my synopsis, but it's not like it really matters when at the very end you don't even get an ending. It mocks you instead. You put the final item in an old tomb, the game cuts to black, and then shows a shot of planet you're on. You are then presented with a completed unrelated quote from an author named David Foster Wallace. The quote tells you how your childish entertainment was just that. It was childish entertainment. It was theatre, smoke, and mirrors. It was all meant to excite and gratify an audience. In reality though, there is no audience. There's no one to clap for actual heroism.  The ending is a slap on the face to anyone who might of bought this. If I were to take a guess, the creator might of enjoyed the authors books and this quote. He also might of just needed a quote that talked about how entertainment is meaningless that could also be construed as why do you need an ending. I imagine the guy working on this didn't know where he was going with the story while writing the three pages or less of text in the game. He then realized at the last moment he needed an ending to his 2 hour affair. He then couldn't think of one that left the audience reasonably satisfied and maybe one that also left them a few questions so they could possibly theorize what was going on. Instead of thinking of an ending like that, he decided to just go with a quote. Again, a quote that basically said that you completed the game and because of that, you don't deserve any praise and contentment you might of gotten from a real ending.  I hope the guy who created this takes his skills and applies himself to another endeavor, but actually gets feedback throughout his process to realize what makes games good and fun. I hope the creator can learn how to make a video game engaging and enjoyable. Maybe then he could go on to make something that actually is like a Metroid or Castlevania. Still, looking at this overall, I'm left with disappointment. It had the possibility of being a tightly packed metroidvania that lasted a few hours, but instead we got a straight path through the same rocky areas and fighting the same enemies for 2 hours. The only thing I think I enjoyed about the game might of been the art and animation on main character, but that is not enough for me to care about this game.  Ultimately, it's just a bad indie game that could of been much better if the creator put more time into it and actually had feedback on what makes video games fun.    Also, a side note. Most of the reviews in the description of the game are either badly written, misleading, or links to a random person on tumblr who doesn't know what he's talking about. ",

It's a couple hours long and it's worth your time if only for the feelings you're left with at the end. If you want a metroidvania that lets you run and gun and hits all of your pleasure centers, this is not the game for you and in your case I cannot recommend it.   This is a game that will leave your jaw slightly agape as you wonder what the ♥♥♥♥ just happened. It is rare after 20+ years of gaming that anything surprises me, REALLY surprises me, catches me completely unaware, and this game did. What exactly does the title refer to? What is inescapable? What do the cryptic bits of the description mean? What DID they find on the planet?",

            "review_text": "This game has no redeeming features, the gameplay is plain and oversimplified, the level design is lazy and repetitive, the puzzles are mostly based on backtracking and serve no purpose other than to make game last longer (it still takes only 2 and a half hours to finish though), the combat is oversimplistic and offers no real challenge at all, the enemies have no AI and are all of only 3 different types and the plot is cut short by an unsatisfying ending right when it was beginning to build up.  The store page says this game has an intriguing storyline and a though provoking ending, but those two things are not true. The plot does not thicken or develops enough to the point were the story becomes complex and interesting and the 'ending' is composed of nothing more than a random quote that (while itself alone is indeed full of insight) hardly has any correlation to the rest of the game and serves no other purpose than to give the game an undeserved sense of depth. If this game had the right to be called intriguing and insightful then if I were to make rom hack of a random NES game and put a quote of Plato in the ending then that rom hack should also have the right to be called intriguing and insightful.  Inescapable is nothing more than a lazy game that makes a generally poor, boring and unfinished application of the old metroidvania formula and that despite it's claims of having a meaningful plot, does not really manages to build a interesting story with anything resembling a climatic ending.",

Inescapable will never fulfill that feeling. You will continue to go through a linear pathway of samey environments throughout 95% of the game, and nothing will ever really matter. You will shoot the same boring enemies, gain the same boring vague snippets of story, and wonder why you bothered. Avoid this game.",

            "review_text": "Inescapable is an old school experience that gives its homage to Amiga and PC games from the early 90's. The game caught my eye as it looked like a mix of Flashback meets Metroid, sadly it's neither and it's really not a good experience either.  The game itself could almost fit on a 3½ floppy disk as the size of the game is less than 2.5 megabytes. Because of this there aren't a lot of sound effects, music, animations or sprites or enemy variations in the game.  The game itself is extremely easy, short and predictable. Don't expect a metroidvania, if so then you'll be greatly disappointed.  It would've been fine if the game was released as a free title or just a school project or similar, but I sadly can't recommend buying this.",

However it has the overall feel of a demo to it, relatively short and missing a few propper features like a map screen that leaves you running back and forth aroun the levels a little longer than you'd want to, without progressing the narrative.   Would definately reccomend (Especially for £3.59!) and will certainly be buying any sequels/ developments of the franchise.",

The game lacks the charm and complexity of games like Valdis (which is on Steam) or Symphony of the Night (which unfortunately is not on Steam). But, with all this said, it's not a bad metroidvania. It does have an interesting premis (even calling it a story is a stretch) and a large world for you to explore and gain new items and abilities.   It's not a bad game, really. Just one that could have really been better. But for the price, I would recommend it.",

First of all, it would be nice to have more variety of monsters - it's not fun fighting 2 or 3 monster with different collors. This game also could be a bit more hard. You will probably die only when falling at begin of game, or maybe from drowning few times, but that's all. Enemies aren't any danger in this game. And most important thing - music. You can hear some environment and screams, but that's not what anybody would expect from game soundtrack. Some people point as negative that this game doesn't have map - is that really a bad thing? It's not so hard to remember few rooms or places which you still haven't visited, since it's not a big and long game. You can beat it in 1,5-2 hours max. Is this game worth buying? I did enjoyed it, maybe not so much that I would recommend it to everyone, but if you are looking for something not bad to beat in one sitting, or you do enjoy 'side scrolling action combined with adventure style puzzles', where puzzles are simple, you can buy it at sale.",
