            "review_text": " hello darkness my old friend   No really, this game is pretty cool. It started out as a freeware title that I obsessed over for a few years. It was simplistic but genius in its execution and design and overall a really memorable and fun experience. This game (I've only been playing for like 45 minutes but I'm already in love) seems to improve on the original, with a more stable-feeling engine and a more satisfying approach to flying and flapping and sliding through gates. It seems to be quite easier as well but again I'm not that far into it yet.  It's great. Play it or something.",

            "review_text": "tl:dr This game is great.  A very elegantly designed....platformer? There aren't any platforms to speak of but I can't think of another way to describe Flywrench. You're a small white rectangle with the ability to flap yourself to ascend while turning red and tumble and bounce off walls while turning green. You pass harmlessly through barriers of the color you currently are, whereas you die immediately if you hit a different-color wall or barrier. The controls are extremely tight and that's good because this game quickly becomes very challenging. Your (numerous) failures don't annoy however because upon death you respawn immediately and try again. Also helpful is the fact that new worlds (each one introduces a new mechanic) are unlocked once a set number of stages are completed so if you find a stage particularly difficult, you can skip it and come back later without hampering progression. It evokes both Super Meat Boy and N+ and comes highly recommended to anyone who likes difficult stage-based platform challenge games.",

            "review_text": "This is one of those games that is just plain fun. It felt a lot like hotline miami, where you just zone out to the AMAZING soundtrack and fly through challenging levels, but the second you die you are immediately back in the action.  Usually in games level design ramps up as you go through, meaning as levels get really hard, you will tend to try at a level for 10 minutes, just to beat it and move on to an even harder level without any sort of break. This game combats that by still leaving in challenging, but not extremely difficult levels in between really hard ones, so you have a minute or two to relax (sort of) and listen to the music.  Speaking of the music, the soundtrack is really just crazy good. the DnB, and electro in this game is some of the best I have ever heard! I stand by my reference to Hotline Miami, as while it is completely different, it has a very similar vibe.  My computer accidentically deleted my saves after I was about 3 planets in, then after playing almost to the sun, my computer decided to RESTORE MY OLD SAVE setting me back to the 3rd planet :(, so no I am playing again and I am still loving every second of it! (minus a few levels that were just really tedious).  The one feature that this game is really lacking is the ability to adjust sound effect volume. I want to be able to turn the music way up, and only be able to barely hear the SFX, but the only option is to turn SFX off completely. The game is still pretty new, so I hope this is added in a patch.  EDIT: So this game is really extremely fun, and has the darksouls quality of making you die a lot, but you always know it's your fault (never the game's), and that you can do better... untill the second to last planet (each planet is a series of 20 or so levels). Once you reach murcury, all the levels put you on some rediculously short timer, and it become less about skill, and more about memorizing the exact pixel perfect sequence of button pushes in order to get through the level.  These timers take the forms of pinweels that 'Push' you through a level, or gates that only stay open X ammount of seconds after you trigger them to open, often closing RIGHT as you are passing through them. The pinweels are especially frustrating because not only do they push you from the back, but if you are going to fast (because, idk, your being chased by a SPINNING WALL OF DEATH) then you will hit the front side of the pinweel and die! This causes a margin of error that is so small it's almost feels impossible, like where the keys on my keyboard/controller physically cannot actuate fast enough to get through the obsticals.  The game was still REALLY fun up untill Murcury though, so it's still worth a buy",

            "review_text": "I was drawn to this game for two reasons: first I thoroughly enjoyed Nidhogg (developed by the same people), and second I love execution based gameplay like Dustforce or Trackmania where you replay a level over and over trying to perfect it, but unfortunately Flywrench lands far from the fun experience of hitting the retry button while telling yourself “I won’t mess up this time!”. Instead the “flywrench” you play as is hard to control, the smallest misstep leads to an unrecoverable death, and the levels become ruthlessly unforgivable at the end, but beyond any mechanical fault, the game simply wasn't fun for me in the same way as Dustforce or Trackmania is.  The basic goal of the game is to navigate small quick levels by flapping your flywrench to stay aloft while using the joystick to glide from side to side. The levels start off pretty simple but quickly expand with different mechanics, the most prominent being dodging purple barriers while pressing certain buttons to pass through colored barriers. But unfortunately not matter how much I played, I could never control the flywrench to the proficiency needed to precisely navigate stages without touching a barrier or the walls (which starts bouncing you all over the place and is nearly impossible to recover from before you hit something that will kill you), it feels like a precision platformer with terribly unresponsive controls.  When I first started playing, I didn’t mind the controls so much because the levels were really short and there wasn't much that could kill you, but about halfway through, the levels started getting longer and the path that you need to navigate smaller, but I still persevered hoping something would click and that I would eventually get better, but any improvement I showed was far outstripped by the ramp in difficulty of the levels until I gave up after completing every level up to 19/21 Mercury. And that was it, I couldn't win those last three levels and couldn't muster any interest to keep trying; I wasn't having any fun, so I quit.  Overall the game has some potential if you are into really hard and unforgiving games, but most of the time when I died, I didn’t feel it was my fault. Instead it felt like it was the the difficult controls and the unforgiving level design that was to blame, this made it frustrating to play. When I did manage to complete a level it felt like it was due to luck more than any skill on my part, sapping any sense of achievement from winning and not providing any incentive to continue on. So unless you really know you are the kind of person who loves throwing themselves at insurmountable challenges, I recommend passing this game bye. There are other games in the Steam, there is bound to be another that will love you back, beacause Flywatch sure won’t.",

It feels a lot like Super Meat Boy, except where SMB gets you mad, this game manages to calm you down, no matter how hard the levels are. Most of the time. Mercury is infuriatingly hard. As in, I got to the fourth level and thought, you can't do this. But the game starts out fine. Then it gets harder.   Well, I never was a writer. Just buy this, on sale if possible, but buy it.
