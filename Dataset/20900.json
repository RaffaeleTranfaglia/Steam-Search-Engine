            "review_text": "When I first played The Witcher, I was in middle school and I had pirated the game. Like most middle schoolers, I wasn’t very smart and the only thing I really looked for in a game was how many bad guys I could murder. I finished the game and quickly forgot about it. Only after I was in college did I realize to the full extent the awful choices that I had made during my first playthrough of The Witcher. My crimes were beyond description. I killed street dogs and innocent travelers just to loot 2 orens worth of stuff from their corpses. I slept with women and promptly abandoned them to be murdered by angry mobs or overzealous knights. I killed a fellow witcher. I walked away from a chance to have a happy family with a woman who loved me in order to sleep with my sex buddy sorceress who I thought looked hotter. I helped commit mass genocide, murdering dozens of non-humans fighting for freedom.  By chance I happened to see The Witcher: Enhanced Edition on sale during Steam Summer Sale 2014. I took it as a sign from heaven. Lord Gaben the Redeemer was speaking to me through my computer, offering me a chance to atone for my sins of the first playthrough. Now I could do what I had not done in middle school. I would uphold justice and help the weak. I would be the hero that Vizima needed, but not the one it deserved. And I could do it with 75% off. I clicked buy and my $1.99 ascended to the heavens while the face of Lord Gaben smiled down upon me.",

            "review_text": "The Witcher was released almost nine years ago and regularly goes on sale for a couple of dollars or less. The question for today's player isn't so much if the game is worth your money but rather if it's worth your time. The answer, in true Witcher fashion, isn't entirely black and white.  The game for me was, overall, enjoyable. The combat system is unique, and regardless of it's mixed reviews, I found it to be a serviceable and even somewhat cool RPG combat system. The finishers tend to get a bit repetitive but add a nice, and gruesome, touch. Although the main story isn't incredibly epic, the decisions that you make along the way feel like they are, and have a significant impact on certain characters fates. I particularly enjoyed the economic system in the early to mid-game, when you actually feel like you need to put in work to earn those Orens, because everyone has their hand in your coin pouch, and everything you want to accomplish has a price. Unfortunately this fades towards the end of the game as there simply isn't anything left to buy and no one left to bribe. Graphically the game doesn't look bad, it’s got its hiccups sure, but nothing that interferes with playability.  Geralt, despite being one of the ugliest human beings I've ever seen in this particular game, somehow manages to slay more women than monsters--quite an accomplishment considering aptitude for his profession. The dude simply can't miss, and it's undeniably entertaining to see just how many naughty cards you can collect. It also adds an interesting layer of complexity to Geralt's ongoing romance with a certain red-haired sorceress. No matter how serious their relationship tries to become, the White Wolf simply can't stop banging other women. Relationships are hard. Players unfamiliar with the series may find Geralt's character at first take to be bland, dull, or flat out boring. However, once you begin to understand his complexities, his sarcastic and cynical nature, and his convictions, you'll surely come to appreciate this incredibly rich and interesting character as so many others have.  The world map by today's standards is pretty small but the game easily has 50 hours of content. This translates into A TON of backtracking. By the end of Chapter II I was more familiar with the streets of Vizima than my own neighborhood, which is great because the mini-map is zoomed in way too far and makes navigation a little frustrating. I often found myself needing to open the world map just to find a house that was actually ten feet away. NPCs carry on with their daily lives, which at first seems pretty cool, until you're searching for one for twenty minutes because he's not getting drunk at the inn for once and he's slipped off his magical RPG quest-tracking bracelet. Because Geralt's a Witcher, monster contracts play a role in the game, unfortunately most of them are simply kill X number of Y monster and turn in their eyes/teeth/skins/whatever. One of them even has Geralt collecting flowers...??! That's like hiring Agent 47 to assassinate a weed in your garden.   The recycling of NPC textures is somewhat distracting but doesn't ruin the experience. Expect though, to see the same fat guy, skinny guy, and half-naked hooker models reused over and over throughout your adventure. The game also suffers painfully from a gear shortage. I found myself using the same armor and two swords throughout most of my adventure. The difficulty on normal is average, as it should be, but does have some frustrating moments. Too many enemy groups have to ability to stun-lock Geralt, causing him to stagger like a drunken derelict as you helplessly pound on your peripherals for way longer than any doctor recommends.   Mini-games are present; dice poker has you playing poker by rolling dice instead of drawing cards and is ok at first but you'll quickly get tired of it. There are also fist fights which pit Geralt against an array of fighters of supposedly increasing difficulty, however, once you figure out the somewhat wonky fighting mechanics you'll be able to beat the crap out of even the strongest opponents with virtually no effort. Overall, the mini-games felt like they could have been left out and, much like me at a party, no one would have even noticed they weren’t there.   Now, we circle back to our original question; is The Witcher worth your time in 2016? As a fan of The Witcher 3 I certainly found it to be worth mine. Despite it's age and other concerns, the game is still pretty darn good. If you're completely new to the series it would seem like the obvious place to start but I would actually recommend starting with the Witcher 3 and working back to this one. Many may not agree, but the game is 50 hours long and sometimes feels like a slog. If you're not already invested in these stories and characters, and the lore of this world, playing this game first, as a contemporary player, could potentially turn you off to the entire franchise and that would be a shame. If you're a fan of the Witcher 3, like me, and want to experience more content from this world, then there's no reason not to give this game a spin.  Final score: 7/10 RECOMMENDED.  Thank you for reading and good hunting",

            "review_text": "The Witcher is such a janky, unpolished game; a game you can clearly tell was made by total amateurs. But under the copy pasted NPCs, stiff animations and wonky as hell combat you're left with one of the most ambitious games of 2007 and the banging introduction to one of the best new WRPG series in the past 10 years.  In the game, you play as Geralt of Rivia who is a witcher, a mutant monster hunter-for-hire, who finds himself caught in the middle of a conspiracy of assassinating kings and ushering in the end times. The games story leads you hoping around the small country of Temeria: from swampy villages overrun by zealotry to a walled city plagued by a literal disease and corruption. What seperates The Witcher from many WRPGs is it's take on morality and choices: while many games go for a very binary 'Good Cop vs. Bad Cop' approach marked by convient color-coded meters coughMassEffectcough, TW1 instead places a heavy emphasis on grey morality. As it says on the marketing blurb, there are no hardline good guys and paragons of virtue: everyone is very flawed in various ways and it's up to you to decide how you will approach or ally with them. While there's alot of unneeded fluff to some of the story (Chapters 1 and 4, specifically) but ultimately every moment and character feels incredibly memorable and well-writen. Friends like Thaler, Dandelion, Zoltan and enemies like Javed, the Professor and Salamandrian bandits all add lots of life and personality to the setting. Even if you started with The Witcher 3 and are spoiled by the overall higher quality... everything , you'll begin to see the same ingredients that made the third game so great.   And then there's the bad. When I say The Witcher is jank, it is J A N K. Geralt moves faster going forward than moving backward or strafing left and right. Combat isn't like a typical action RPG where you keep clicking to attack, but instead it's like a psuedo-music game where you must left-click on time. Positioning is also a pain in the butt because of said movement control jankiness. I think the gameplay is the biggest issue with the first Witcher because, to be quite honest, CDPR really didn't seem to know what they were doing as this was literally their first game. This can be a huge deterrent for new gamers, especially those coming from the much more refined TW3.   But despite that, I still highly recommend playing this game if you're looking for a great WRPG that isn't made by either Bethesda or Bioware (both of which I think are slacking but that's another story for another time). It's flaws are less the result of malice and more the result of inexperience and if you really want to get into The Witcher and see how everything began, I can't recommend any other place to begin but the first game.",

            "review_text": "The Witcher is a strange beast. At this point, everyone knows how beloved The Witcher III instantly became, and everyone knows it as a true force to be reckoned with in terms of Western RPGs. So, to preface, the most important thing about getting into The Witcher 1 is to remind yourself that this is not The Witcher III. Not at all. The Witcher is clunky, aged, and features some questionable design choices. But at the same time, it features some great dialogue, story, and setpieces.  Gameplay -- The hardest part about getting through The Witcher is, regrettably, actually playing it. The combat is a very simple click in rhythm style affair with two swords for different enemy types and three fighting styles for each sword. It's not horribly involved, and it's usually more time consuming and frustrating than it is fun. You are also outfitted with 'signs', an alternative for magic. These signs vary in usefulness, and I personally didn't use them a lot, with the exception of Igni. However, I may be underselling them, and they may very well be overpowered. I'm not sure. Along with this, the game also emphasizes the creation and consumption of potions, which the game will be nearly unbeatable without. As your own personal skill does little to influence the battles of this game, potions will be mandatory as a crutch. The leveling system is also unique, in that every level you get a handful of skill points to put into various skill trees. But, these skills are divided into bronze, silver, and gold levels. It takes many, many levels to get gold skills, and I didn't even see any until the final act. This may be my own fault for not completing every single side quest in the game, but the pacing does feel off. To level up, create potions, or pass the time, you must meditate, which requires a fire. It works.  I would be remiss if I didn't address one of my biggest problems with the game. The quest/level design is designed in such a way that you will spent the majority of your time running from one end of the act area to the other, repeatedly. This is a problem in almost every act, barring IV and V where this is slacked a little. Act I is designed as a ring shaped road with various buildings and divergent paths from it, and it seems every quest phase will take place on whatever the opposite end of the ring you're at is. Same thing with acts II and III, which both take place in the exact same location (albeit with new locations added for act III), where you must even go so far as to take a ferry ride to another area just to complete some basic quests. It's monotonous, and it's easily the most glaring fault of the game. Rather than true gameplay, it's time filler with no actual value added. For being a game, the actual gameplay is not exactly exceptional.  Story -- This is where the game actually begins to shine. This game forces you to make a lot of morally ambiguous decisions that can radically alter how the story plays out. Do you, a monster slayer, side with a monster for the sake of doing what's right? Or do you acknowledge that slaying said beast is your purpose in life, and ignore your personal feelings to do what must be done? Several decisions of this caliber are thrusted towards you, and I sat staring at my monitor more than once, unable to make a choice. For the most part, the plot itself is gripping. It's what kept me playing and convinced me to keep coming back. I will say that it does hit a point where the story becomes almost stupid, but the side quests and implications of character actions save it from being a complete game killer. The dialogue is a little weird, but appealing. Many characters use modern slang and sayings despite the game taking place in an 11th century fantasy setting. It's a little jarring, but not wholly unpleasant.  Graphics/Sound -- The graphics are, as one would expect, aged. There are a lot of reused character models, and a lot of these models are downright corny. The old woman model is especially eyebrow raising. Some of the areas in the game are crafted quite well, however, despite the level design mishaps referenced earlier. The swamps feel appropriately foreboding. The city is as dingy and unfortuante as you would expect. Sunlit fields are contrasted with noonwraiths, adding a troubling element of horror to an otherwise beautiful scene. These areas allow the game to truly breathe. The sound design is rather hit and miss. Some of the voice acting is as overbaked as the character models, where other voice acting flourishes. Geralt himself is exceptionally well voiced, sounding both apathetic to the world and caring at the same time. It's subtle, but effective. The music is serviceable, but nothing that will make you run out and buy the soundtrack any time soon.  As a whole, The Witcher is really a developmental step for CD Projekt Red, as one would assume. It sets up the basis of some general mechanics that will be carried on through future The Witcher titles, but it misses the target a lot as well. That said, it perfectly sets up the rest of the franchise, and has some great moments that will keep you playing. I do recommend it, but do be warned that it is not the masterpiece the newer games are.",

Decent mini games with 'Dice poker' and 'Fist fights'  Lots of interesting characters, monsters and areas.  Cons:  Game will not work on windows 10 (seems to run fine for the first few chapters, waiting for confirmation on the last few chapters)  When you need to use the flame torch sometimes geralt randomly puts it away (annoying as hell in dark crypts and tombs) though you mainly use 'cat' potions that allow you to see in the dark.  Lots of people report random crashes which is most frequent on windows 10 as i mentioned although on chapter 5 i myself experience a few random crashes on windows 8.1 but they were very rare for me and didnt halt my playing experience.  Overall decent action rpg game people tend to complain about the combat and user interface but i think these reviews that mention this were written before the 'enhanced update' came into play, honestly no where near as bad as people are making out.  7/10",

It feels great! Few games have ever achieved this level of detail.

Even some side quest have some connection with the main quest. side quests are not 'Must' in this game but they are as fun as main quest. most of side quest can be done through main quest, so it's not a bother to your experience. Dialogues are plane AWESOME. Best in my book. Your choices DO matter. even better then 'walking dead' series.  Sound &amp; music: it's awesome. though it can be a bit dull sometimes. but when you are in a battle, it keeps you on your toes.  Graphics: Let's just say for this generation gamer it is acceptable, for me it was always awesome. neat models with good textures and nice shadow maps (no self shadowing). it doesn't support Vsync or triple buffering but they can be done through RadeonPro or nvidia controls. post processing is a bit too pixelated and it's a little bothering.  Overal: This game is like an interactive book. It's a MUST for every rpg player or for someone who likes a good story.",

I do not really play many RPGs and never really played any, but compared to other RPGs I have had time with, this was something else. Considering it came out in 2007 and provided me with over 30 hours of gameplay really amazed me. I was really proud with what CD Projekt Red had made here and obviously has evolved onto the current generation platforms. Of course with a great response outta me there were a few bumps in the road. Probably the most addressed here is the fighting mechanics. They aren't the best. Some can even say it sucked and I wouldn't blame them. Of course we should all factor in that it did come out in 2007 and this game was most likely on a tight budget (I am not saying it was on a tight budget but it seems likely). However the rest of the gameplay and plot does eclipse the bad fighting mechanics and really gives a you a great expeirence and also expands your 'book fanatsies' in terms of a monster riddled world (not sexual fantasies you uncultured cactus). In the end I would only change the fighting mechanics, and also the lack of direction in certain parts of the game, but can easily be figured out if you have a lot of gaming expeirence. Now at the time I am writing this review, The Witcher: Enhanced Edition is not available for individual download and is only in a Witcher bundle. I would wait until it is being sold on Steam individually because during Steam sale I paid $1.49 for it and it was a helluva deal and it gave me 30+ hours of gameplay. Definite Buy when it's not in that bundle because $5 doesn't hurt you terribly. Get the game and try it, and don't be like me with a scrub Mac with a crap GPU and can't play The Witcher 2 because of it..    *EDIT* I have beaten the second Witcher on Xbox 360 and surprisingly the first Witcher is the best of the two. First one offers more hours of gameplay, better music, more engaging story, but however the improved combat makes up in the second Witcher no doubt. Still recommend that you play both because the lore is unmatched in this series. Don't diss on the first one despite it's lack luster combat.  *Second Edit* Witcher 3 is the best RPG I've ever played now, but still give this game a shot if on sale.",

You get to make game-changing decisions that let you feel as though you are a part of the game.   The first chapter is rather slow, but it gives you time to experiment around and get a feel for the combat. Some of the game mechanics were not explained properly (such as the alchemy) and it took a bit of experimenting to get some things to work. The combat is not truly combat. You click when an icon appears and let your character do the rest. That, coupled with the fact that signs were too overpowered, led to a dull gameplay experience. However, all that are minor annoyances compared to what the game is truly capable of. The developers don't hold your hand and lead you through the entire game. Instead, they give you a few basic tutorials and leave the rest to experimentation. It also helps that alchemy is not a must (unless you're on higher difficulties).   All in all, the games treats you like an adult, leaving you with choices that feel real. You must choose between several choices based on your moral code, since nothing in this game is truly black and white. You would be hard pressed to decide sometimes and what you choose really just comes down to what you feel is right. The graphics are'nt amazing, and there are quite a few technical issues, but overall, I feel that this game is worth playing.",

You'll make excursions to nearby swamps and cemeteries, so expect a fair dose of combat, but the core of the game is the investigation storyline.  Along the way, you'll face ethical quandaries and tough choices. Some choices can significantly affect the game's final chaper. Other choices might simply affect which girl you'll bed that evening...  I really enjoyed The Witcher. If I have any complaint, it's the pacing. As each chapter begins, you find yourself assaulted with quests. Eventually you'll figure out how quests turn on and off over the course of the game as you are able to advance each one. Turns out quests are actually highly intertwined plot elements.  Despite this complaint, it's a fresh and entertaining RPG.",

I didn`t expect that a game released 7 years ago would achieve such a feat. CD Projekt did a wonderful job creating a deep, rich and satisfying story that reminded me that sometimes having an excellent story is as important as having fantastic gameplay mechanics. Albeit the magnificent tale, the witcher falls short of delivering in its combat system, sometimes being painfully buggy during the heat of battle. Power-ups frequently doesn`t work and some spells are way more overpowered than others. In the end however, the absorbing nature of the game keeps pulling me back for more. I hope the witcher 2 would solve the above issues and it`ll be splendid.  Pros: - Undeniably good story - Lots of quests to take on, sometimes overwhelmed by what to do next and often lead astray - Good alchemy and skill tree system - So many chats to chat - Not so terrible graphics for a 2007 game  Cons: - Combat mechanics are buggy, some skills are OP, early game is tough for hard mode - Tutorial are thin and for the first few hours, prepare to be confused - Small variety of weapons and armors  Hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing this.

In this game, after his apparent death in the novels. He awakes with amnesia and no recollection of his death nor the people in his life. After that he is launched on a quest of revenge as he remembers who he is.  One of the finest aspects of the Witcher is how it's quests are designed. You are never shown the consequences of your actions immediately. Instead, in later chapters of the game you see the results of your choices. This was done to prevent players simply reloading and not accepting the consequences of their actions. As a result your actions really do feel like they have weight, and it's rare to see this executed properly in a game.  There are of course negative aspects of the Witcher. Most people cite it's combat as the biggest drawback of the game. I'm inclined to agree, as I initially stopped playing just before finishing the prologue. My advice is to push on past the prologue as you start to really get into the game during it's first chapter. Eventually you will fall inlove with this game and it's timing based combat.",

I suggest playing it before going at The Witcher 2 so you have an idea of whats going on, plus it will make The Witcher two more enjoyable.  The Witcher is a great RPG with anywhere from 50-80 hours of gameplay depending on how you want to take it along with choices to make that effect the story down the road and the game doesn't hold your hand. Minus chapters 2 and 3 (due to their watered down quests that seem to go on forever and the boring environments) out of 5 chapters along with a Prologue and a Epilogue the game is pretty fun and entertaining.   Combat in the game turns off a lot of people right off the bat, I say give it a chance because once you get used to it you'll feel more intune to the way it works and you possibly may even enjoy it. For those who want to take on the hard difficulty, prepare to possibly rage due to a few boss fights and a few other silly encounters that are just plain unfair, unfourtunatly.   The voice acting in the game is decent but often times laughable and the animations minus some of the combat animations are just plain silly.

In my eyes, this game has more to offer than some modern, high-praised AAA titles.  Also, it is said that, despite it's sheer size, there is a way to finish the game within like a few minutes. Can you find out how?",

Geralt of Rivia is something between a warrior and a wizard, and of course one of the most interesting characters i've ever seen in a Fantasy Novel/Game. Every epic fantasy/RPG/good story lover must play this, and heed my words this is indeed a very good story.  Another thing that pops out when you play is the atmosphere at the taverns and inns, the sounds, the music, the people everything is in the right spot. You'll have a good old school feeling when fighting a boss, few games nowadays have this effect on me.  Badass character, Amazing story, Great RPG, Inmersive atmosphere, hacking and slashing action here and there...what else do you want! The only thing i missed... Was a dragon.",

The graphics are quite awesome for a 2007 game and the effects very nice too. The characters are very well roled, each one has a meaning for his/her existance, good AI. The game also brings the player into positions to make choices that affect the rest of the game which is interesting. The fight system at start is VERY boring till you gain a few levels, there's not much variety on attack styles which migh make the player bored. The main character is very cool, nice voiced, awesomely designed and ingame you can also choose the way of your sexlife (The European version has totally uncencored 'se cards') or to have a romance story.  I was amazed that a Polish developer team managed to create such a brilliant game. Recommended for the lovers of the kind, specially for those who like interesting story-lines in RPG games.

            "review_text": "TLDR: Fantastic game; Combat is not very good but story is absolutely amazing. Graphics great for 2007, obviously lackluster for 2015. Not open world. Play on hardest difficulty, because after chapter 1 game is a cakewalk. Although not needed, (really at all) the story in this game serves to clarify references in the later games and creates a bigger sense of immersion in the game world. 8.5/10 because of combat and lack of challenge.  This is my Witcher story. I bought Witcher 3 because I wanted a new RPG to play; it was absolutely amazing. I only got through the first chapter and realized that I didn't want the experience to end so quickly so I decided to buy the first one and work my way through that and once done with that play through the second and then eventually move on to finish the third. That's how good this series is, if you're a fan of action RPG's with good stories like me, get the trilogy pack instead of this because if you can bear the combat/graphics (both of which are not THAT bad) of Witcher 1 you will definitely want to play the second and third. You will also enjoy them moreso because you have the background info of the first one.   So I loaded up Witcher 1 for the low cost of $9.99. First thing I noticed when I started playing the Witcher was the graphics, although extraordinary for 2007, after overclocking my GPU to play the third I was a little disappointed, but you can't ask for much when you backtrack to a game that came out 8 years ago!  The next thing I noticed was that this game's story is awesome. Cheesily enough, you start off with amnesia. However Geralt's lack of memory serves to push the story forward; Alongside the main conflict in the story, you are trying to find out about Geralt's past through quests and former friends. The best part about the story is that you actually can't wait to find out what happens next. This is the only rpg where I actually read the extra books and lore things you find in the game world because they serve the story so well. Where most RPG's push for progression by enticing you with new pieces of armor or weapons down the road, the Witcher puts you in a position where you actually want to find out what happens next and you don't really care about much else. However, at times, much of the story is told just by running back and forth and talking to various npcs - there gets to be a point when you want to just go out and smash some monster face. That leads me into one of the only two fair cons to find in this game (because you can't count the graphics of this game as a real con due to its age.)   My problems with this game are the combat and the lack of challenge. The fights remind me of 'Test Your Might' challenges from Mortal Kombat. You just wait until your sword turns yellow and then click, thats it. The whole combat system is click, wait a second or two, click, repeat. there's no real challenge or engagement to it. If you can't kill a monster you just reload and drink more buff potions. When I say there is no challenge to this game, I mean it. I always play games on their hardest difficulty just to feel like I really did beat the game. Even on the most difficult setting, I only had a few times where I struggled at all, and only one time I actually had any real difficulty. Chapter 1's boss fight is the only time I ever found myself struggling. Other than the boring combat and lack of challenge I don't have anything else to really gripe about. I mean the inventory system could have been better and there could have been more applications for alchemy but all in all this is a fantastic game. Sorry for the long winded review.",

            "review_text": "It's pretty rough around the edges (which is understandable given its age and place in CD Projekt Red's catalogue) but quite enjoyable. It is unlike any other RPG I've played in a while. I love the special agent/PI character that is Geralt, it's quite unique for the genre. As is the combat style. Fights (including boss fights) can be surprisingly easy or incredibly difficult based on how much you've paid attention and done your homework. For players of other series, the game has level design and exploration along the lines of Dragon Age, with a combat style that (oddly) reminds me of the Jedi Knight games.  The game has many faults, though. Character assets are reused over and over with only a couple dozen unique characters in the game (surprisingly, though, this didn't irritate me as much as it might sound). Voice acting cutscenes are of a mediocre quality; not terrible but they've been surpassed elsewhere (like the subsequent entries in the series). Combat can be incredibly frustrating sometimes. For example, being stunned repeatedly by four wraiths to the point you cannot move or attack is maddening. It also felt that there were too many elements to the game, some of which can be (and ultimately have to be) ignored in favour of others. For example, I didn't get anywhere near maxing out my character (despite doing every quest) and never touched bombs. I also didn't feel all the signs were as useful as they could be; some easily overshadow others. Combat is generally quite easy (with a few exceptions).  I very much enjoyed the claustrophobic, urban setting of the first half of the game. When it changed setting in the second half I was, at first, relieved for a change of scenery but the following areas (while containing enjoyable quests) are overly large and it feels like all you're ever doing is walking from point to point (with, surprisingly - compared to earlier areas - few enemies to worry about). The game also has a somewhat awkward, somewhat rewarding epilogue sequence, a huge twist (if you're paying attention) and a cliffhanger ending.  Overall, I'd recommend it if you really want to play the entire trilogy. But if you're not that fussed, I'd probably suggest just reading up on what happens in the first game (and about its characters) and moving on to The Witcher 2 (where things improve and change drastically).",

            "review_text": "Just completed the game (didn't do all the side quests), and it definitely goes on my top 5 favorite RPG's. The story and lore of the world created in these games by itself is so immense I felt that captivated by it's story. So captivated in fact that I even started reading the books! The book series story chronologically takes place before the game series begins, and they do a fantastic job making the world created in the books come to life visually! What's even better is that you don't have to read the books to get into the game but it often gives a player whose read them a tip of the hat with settle references to the book series non-readers would miss. I highly recommend reading the book series to really get into this world of The Witcher, but enough about that! Let's get into the pro's and cons! Skip to the recaps at the bottom of each one if you don't feel like reading it all  Pros:  Even though this game is almost a decade old it still holds a lot of core RPG and really compared to today's RPG still feels fresh. It has a story that changes based on your decisions, which leads to my next pro This series allows you to port your saves over from game to game. The decisions you make in Witcher 1 effect Witcher 2's story, and Witcher 2 carries over to Witcher 3. Not only does the decisions carry over, but the rare items I work so hard to aquire carry over too! I have began playing Witcher 2 and I was relieved to see my armor, swords, runes, potions, etc. Were all still with me! Especially since most of the awesome rare items are only available towards the end of Witcher 1, but totally worth getting so you can have them in Witcher 2.  Different points of view. Using the F1, F2, F3 you can change from bird's eye view to over the shoulder view! GIving the player the choice to play by their preference.  You get to see boooooobs, and lots of them. Geralt (your character) gets some strange! The story is fantastic. Playing as a Witcher, a master of sword, magic, and alchemy set on hunting down a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sums it up BUT there is SO much content and unexpected twists.  Recap of pros: Well written story, carry over decisions and items throughout the series(Mass Effect got nothing on Witcher), gettin' some strange. (Seriously, Geralt get's laid in like the first 30 mins of the game)  CONS: When doing quest the NPC you need to talk to isn't always at the quest marker. So I'll be tracking it on my map, get there, and the NPC is no where to be found. That's because this game has a constant time cycle and simulates day and night. I simply have to wait (or rest to speed it up) till the certain time period for the NPC to show up again. I get it, it adds realism to the game but dammit I hate having to wait for shop keepers to show up I want to buy my items now dammit.  The NPCs are massivley cloned. ALOT of NPC's, other than the important ones, look just like each other. There are a handful of character designs used for townsfolk, gang members, soldiers etc. So it kind of ruins the immerse effect sometimes. I cut Projekt Red a break though, I mean, when this game was developed it's probably the best they could do with the tech we had. Same with the voice acting too. The special NPC's are their own voice actors throughout the series, but the forementioned NPCs I feel like was 2 or 3 voice actors. All the bandits sound the same.  Compared to todays Open world RPG this game's world is small. Super small. I'm sure at the time this game was released it was very cutting edge but now adays it's going to feel like a small sandbox to the average RPG player. Still a great world though. and finally, the combat system. It takes some getting used to. After I figured it out it was very simple but just clicking on an enemy Diablo style won't work. It's click, wait for the icon, click again. Though after powering up combo's it is fun to watch Geralt slash open an enemy.   Cons recap: Cloned NPC's, short on voice acting, unexplained missing quest NPCs (until undefined time of day), combat system is wierd compared to today's RPGs.   Overall I give this one 8/10 Toast for Twenty's and am definitely looking forward to playing the rest of the sereis, including the books.    ",

Humans are vehemently racist, elves and dwarves are oppressed to the point of revolt, and you're a superhuman created from childhood to slay monsters for coin. You're also the only sane man in a world filled with insanely homicidal people. Oh and you're also the hottest guy ever for the ladies. Wenches love a good monster slayer.  The story is interesting and fairly long, meaning you will dedicate a good 30+ hours to it, also counting many sidequests which help build up the world around you. The game has a pretty good soundtrack which fits the mood at all occasions, and the alchemy system is also nifty yet does not intrude in your enjoyment if you're not the kind of person who wants to focus on making potions (but you should anyway because stats bonuses). The combat is probably the weakest part of the game, being summarized by picking between your 'versus human' or 'versus monster' swords and clicking your mouse in a rhythm, occasionally using a magic spell if you feel like it. Still the fights are generally fast-paced and don't last enough for it to become tiresome.  Definitely recommended for fans of high fantasy and story-driven games, but if you expect combat depth, there is not much to see in The Witcher.",

I suspect most players get put off by the confusing game mechanics, the combat system especially. Once you play enough, you will get the hang of the game's systems. I was slicing up Salamandra with ease by Chapter 2.   If you get bored of the slow detective-like story, don't worry because it picks up by Chapter 3. You can beat the game easy by not doing any side quests, which is what I did. The game has a dark and dingy atmosphere which can feel boring, but it's supposed to tie in with the atmosphere of the series.  Some of the voice acting is pretty bad, and most of the characters faces look deformed. Alvin and Dandelion are the worst. The animations are pretty terrible aswell, like walking and Geralt's fighting.  If you like the story of The Witcher 2 and 3, and have a lot of patience, I recommend giving The Witcher 1 a shot. The scene with The Lady of The Lake and Eredin's spectre at the end are some of my favorite scenes in all The Witcher series.",

It feels like an old timey RPG, with very simplistic, but addictive gameplay models. While the combat may not be supremely engaging, it can be very difficult at times, making preparation before a battle vital to surviving. All you need to do is master the almost, but not quite quicktime attack combat. The animations become more complex, and faster while requiring more timing and clicking with each improvement, making you feel like your moves are getting better and you feel all the more better.   Some potions are easy to make, some are not. Some are very helpful, some not so much. But each one can save your life in a dire situation. You can make a variety of bombs, potions, and oils/weapon enhancements. Some potions even make your character more powerful in general, giving him different abilities and ways to unlock special skills.  Time to talk about the negatives.  The negatives of this game are few, but can really screw with you. My system is very up-to-date and has been updated to keep with the times. However, I have experienced several blue screens through my playtime. I found this extremely odd and angering since no other game has done such a thing to me in the past. Glitches are slightly prevelant, but shouldn't cause too much trouble, and sometimes, the combat can be, at some times, meh. Sometimes, grinding is a factor you might have to use, going through a dangerous swamp to find a single herb for a swallow.   In conclusion, this is a great game, while rough around the edges, is very well made, and has fairly good graphics considering it was made in 2008. I strongly recommend this game, and remember, don't play the other witchers without starting from the beginning. Otherwise, nothing will make much sense in the long run.",

Very detailed story line with many optional quests and 'treasures' to find. Your actions affect you directly, not so much like a 'Fable 1' kind of way but the story changes depending on your choices. What really pleased me about the changing story line was that some of the decisions affect you all the way throughout the game, while some are more sudden. The AI are like real people, often going to work at the same time everyday or randomly go out shopping, so if you are looking for someone you may have to actually go look. The spells, potions and fighting styles were all very key to the game. Has a lot of replay value because you can always go back and make a new choice in many different ortions of the game.  One thing I didn't like was that they don't give you a lot of need to use/pick up any new weapons you find. Some of those weapons are great but just impracticle to use when fighting.

Having said that, I really did enjoy my time with Geralt of Rivia. While some of the quests in the game are 'FedEx' style trips, others are interesting investigations that are both interesting to play and get the player invested in the plot and characters. The game certainly has a story to tell, and is pushing you along that path -- but it's a good story, and one that I quite enjoyed. Sometimes I felt like the game was holding my hand a bit much, telling me where to go or what to do, but other times it let the lore and subtle clues fill in story details or render characters. And the world-builiding and story is really the best thing about this game. The titular character, in particular, is well-done. The game has introduced me to the works of Andrzej Sapkowski, and I look forward to finding out more about Geralt of Rivia in both the novels and CD Projekt RED's follow-up games.",

It's a game that has such powerful choices that it will literally make you reflect on your own morality. When does the means justify the ends? Where does somebody draw the line? Can bad things be jusitfied for a higher cause? These are a few of several questions you will ask yourself by the end of this masterpiece. The characters of the game are also unforgettable. Geralt the protagonist is a badass who you definitely can't help, but be a fan of. NPC's in the game are wonderful too and you can have discussions with them that add more to the world and story of The Witcher. Beyond the story, the gameplay is great too.   The combat system is a fun timing based system where you click at the right times to do combo attacks. In addition, you get signs which can knock down enemies, set up instant kills, light enemies on fire or trap them etc. Defeating enemies grants you EXP along with completing quests. You then level up after accumulating enough EXP and can distribute talent points into Geralt's abilities. Witcher's leveling system for increasing Geralt's strength is incredible. The amount of choices and possibilties are wonderful and every playthrough I always found myself trying out different builds. Witcher 1's combat is incredibly fun, but I won't lie it's far from a amazing combat system or one that will appeal to everyone. Some may just not like the timing nature of the combat system. It's not for everyone and you have been warned about this. Also, I mentioned quests. Witcher does have them.  They are found in the main story and sidequests. You can track quests to figure out where to go and it works very well. Witcher's sidequests are excellent though and a standard that RPG's should look up to. Almost every sidequest has a great story to it that upon completing it allows you to learn more about characters, the world and the story of the game itself. A sign of a well made sidequest is when the player doesn't just do it for a great reward in the game, but also for the content of the quest itself. That's another aspect Witcher excels in. There's as I mentioned a main story consisting of a prologue, epilogue and 5 chapters inbetween those two.   Each chapter you go through in the game is drastically different. In one you explore a village and help the residents there, but come to learn of some of the atrocities the residents have committed there. It ultimately reaches a climax where you must judge the villagers and decide their fates. In another chapter you go to meetings with nobles and powerful polticians where you form strong alliances with powerful people. Then there's a chapter in the game where you have to cooperate with a detective to figure out who committed a murder. The chapter has several different outcomes depending on the choices you make. Different events, dialogue and fights happen all depending on what choices you make. Ultimately, the game's story reaches it's climax in the epilogue and final chapter of the game Chapter 5. Chapter 5 is one of the most epic parts I've ever played in a RPG. Afterward, in the epilogue you confront the final antagonist of the game whom makes references to all the decisions you made throughout the game. Even me doing a sidequest in Chapter 1 was mentioned in the final confrontation of the game. Talk about a game truly changing even by doing small things. The replay value is immense.  In Witcher 1 there are three paths through the game. I won't spoil the three sides, but each one has different scenes, dialogues, locations and fights you experience in them. I'm no fanboy either though and will admit the game doesn't drastically change depending on your decisions. It does change a little, but you're not gonna see half of the entire game change because you aligned yourself with a different side in a future playthrough of the game. Still, the replay value is great and it's the choices making these little changes that make this wonderful game all the more satisfiying to play through. Last, the music.  The music of Witcher 1 is excellent. I'm not much of a fan of orchestrated music, but The Witcher really caught my attention with it's jaw droppingly good soundtrack. Some of the songs in the game such as The River of Life or several others really impressed me. In terms of voice acting, the game can be a mixed bag. Some voice acting is good, but some are not so good. Overall though, The Witcher is a masterpiece and one of my all time favorite games. I think that the world and story of the game are among the very best in any game ever. Beyond that, the combat is very fun, but admittedly is not going to be for everyone and is far from one of the most amazing battle systems ever. Last, the game has a great soundtrack and immense replay value with how choices impact the game. Any RPG fan owes it to themselves to experience this masterpiece of a game. I've finished 4 playthroughs of it and I will definitely play it more times through.  TLDR Version:  Pros: +One of the best stories and worlds in any RPG ever. +Great characters who are incredibly well developed. +Choices that affect how the game plays. Three main sides to choose from in the game each one giving the player a different experience. +Fun combat system that while not amazing or super great is still awesome. +Incredible amount of customization upon leveling. +Excellent soundtrack. +Extremely well done sidequests that players will want to do because the content of the sidequests adds more to the world and story of the game. +The developers CD Projeckt Red are a role model in a industry that screws gamers over. They give out DLC free and all updates or changes they make to their games are free. Also, they make all their games DRM free.  Cons: -Outdated graphics even for the time. -Reused character models for NPC's. -Combat system isn't absolutely incredible and won't appeal to everyone, but it's a lot better then most games out there. -Main plot goes in too many directions and some of the directions it goes in are left as loose ends and never wrapped up by the end of the game. In other words, a little too ambitious for it's own good at times.",

A great story with an intriguing protagonist with a pretty unique position within the world make for hours of compulsive playing.  The Witcher is set in a dark fantasy world where the lines between good and evil are severely blurred and the results of your actions are not always immediately evident. Players navigate through dialogue as they see fit and cannot simply stick to the Paragon/Renegade dialogue options to come out as a saint or a sinner at the end of the game.  A personal highlight of The Witcher for me is the Inns and I found myself dashing straight for the nearest drinking hole whenever I hit a new town. These taverns serve as the hub of a town and serve not only as a place to rest and manage your inventory, but contain a variety of interesting characters to give you additional quests for the area and a small selection of mini games.   I would recommend The Witcher to anyone one likes to get immersed in a game world and enjoys roleplaying games.",

This game is rather old and didn't age very well, as a result it might be a bit hard to get started, although this is mostly depending on whether you've played any old school RPG recently. Ultimately (and to my own surprise) I must say that it's one of the best RPGs I've played.  I've enjoyed the game altogether and chapter 2 aside I don't really have anything negative to say about it. I feel like chapter 2 has been sort of a 'low' in this game as everything seems to drag on endlessly but once one was done with chapter 2, it got much better (in my opinion anyway).   Unfortunately I was having performance issues in certain areas of the game (especially Trade Quarter and Old Vizima) where my FPS would drop as low as &lt; 30, that being said though I've also had a few graphics mods installed so I can't say for certain whether it's a problem with the game itself. All I know is that my hardware should've been more than sufficient to run it at +60 FPS at all times, even with those few texture mods installed.  TL;DR: Great game, probably a must-have for people who are into old school RPGs. People who aren't still should give it a shot and try to overlook the dated graphics as you're getting great value for the money.",

What you’re going to want to do is go to your file explorer, then type “The Witcher” in the search bar, a file should pop up titled “The Witcher enhanced edition”. Once you click on that you will need to click on the system folder, after that right click “the witcher” then go to “send to” then “desktop (create shortcut)”. Once you have your shortcut up you will need to right click it and go to “properties”, in the target box go to the end, add a apace and type –dontforceminreqs, then click apply…you will need to use the shortcut to play the game.

The storyline, however, is very interesting and pulled me in quickly.  This first game in a great series starts out pretty mysteriously, and soon gets straight into action. You go on a long quest to avenge a death, to recover what was stolen and to find things that were lost to you. Along the way you meet a whole lot of interesting people, some you know, some you don't. You even got two bros. Those guys are great.  There are many choices you make that (heavily) impact the game, and it's sequels, so choose wisely what you do. You level up to unlock new abilities, like really cool sword moves, fancy magic and deadly tools. There are many different locations, many people to talk to, lots of quests to complete, and much loot to be had. There's a lot of walking from place to place, unfortunately, so be wary of that.  Overall, this game may be outdated in quite a few ways, but the story is still great and I believe it is a must-play if you plan on playing the other two games.",

If they did a remake of this game (Which I think they should do [CDProjektRed, get on this]) they should rip out the combat and replace it with what they did in The Witcher 2. They remade the combat system for a reason.  At the time of me writing this, the game is $2, and it is completely worth it, but if you are in the future (Which you are [Don't lie to yourself]) Wait for a sale or something to pick it up. Just saying. Then again, that's a general rule for most Steam Games, but follow it especialy for this game.",

Despite it's problems, the Witcher 1 is great RPG. Here's why: your choices actually matter - No clear good or bad choices here, folks. It's all grey. You may even start to care about the world your in and those who inhabit it, all while being apart of an interesting story as it unfolds. The main story can take up to thirty to forty hours to complete if you really want to do everything the game has to offer.   And there is a lot to do: bar fights, gambling, bounties, fetch quests (of course), romances to pursue, and a few books to read.  Gameplay and presentation wise however, the Witcher 1 feels dated. The visuals appear blury at times and characters don't look quite right. The gameplay remains simple throughout the game; just time your clicks so that you can keep a combo going until your enemy falls. Bosses can feel extremely over powered at times too. The menus aren't problematic and don't take much to navigate.  Moving on to performance, with my first experience with this game I was running it on Vista. That was a mistake for sure, the game was prone to crash every two minutes or so, and every cutscene was a nail-bitter because I didn't know if I would see it through to the gameplay on the other side. I should also mention that my PC, - which is definitely capable of running the Witcher 1 at the time - when it was upgrade to Windows 7, experienced a lot less crashing.   If you really want to experience the Witcher 1 get it during a sale so that you won't feel like you've wasted your money if it doesn't run. And similar to Mass Effect, your save file can be transfered to the Witcher 2, so you can continue your adventure and deal with the consequences of whatever awful choices you had to make. It's not perfect, but the Witcher 1 is still a pleasure that any RPG fan won't want to miss out on.  Good hunting, witchers.",

The combat though is awkward but not bad, just not your typical ARPG or hack and slash combat style. But with some mods you can revamp it and most of the game with improvements here and there.  So yeah. Give it a chance would you? At a discount if you feel it's the right price for you. ",

The Witcher is a very mature game while I suggest every RPG fan try this out, beware that there's much gore, nudity, and swearing. The Witcher takes hold of you from the moment you boot it up and doesn't let go until the end, where it violenty tosses you towards The Witcher 2 and you take it because you love it.",

The main storyline and protagonist isn't really too interesting more mediocre for me. Honestly the goal of the game for me ended up feeling like it was about getting to bed as many fair maidens, or well wenches, as possible since you get rewarded for each, high or low born. It was like collecting a card game. Yay... I think how supprisingly enjoyable that was might make me a bad person.  The combat system is very easy, making it rather boring really. The questing is enjoyable. The whole thing feels like a collection of morally grey fairy tales, and less dark than the witcher series gets afterwards, though still dealing with subjects like non-human racism and religious intolerance... (But honestly? To me it feels like kinda the norm in fantasy settings these days. I dunno. Could just be the games I am playing. In any case doesn't reach the very dark levels of 2 and 3.) It adds a charming layer to it all, dealing with magic and deciding how much faith you want to put into 'fairy tales' knowing they might be just tales and they might be true. Any faith in true love or is the best option the sword?  But yeah... Think you have to have a bit of a.... umm... questionable side? To get the most out of this game, since the best part really is trying to get as many cards in the collectible set of women Geralt has... 'impressed', lucky those witchers are infertile or he would have many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... So probably mostly recommended towards completionists with a naughty mind?",

While the combat system isn't my favorite, it still can be a lot of fun once you get used to it. Alchemy makes combat more complex and motivates you to loot everything (at least if you enjoy that sort of thing). However, the balacing towards the end of the game becomes an issue if you really stack up on alchemy. I played on normal and the last few hours were not much of a challenge, especially compared to my first few hours in the swamp.   The graphics aren't up to date, but are still beautiful, especially the lighting in inns and really add to the atmosphere. The environment is sometimes to restrictive, meaning you are gonna find yourself not being able to cross a two foot 'hill.' The game ran pretty stable the the first 2/3, but towards the end it crashed a few times, unfortunately. This is especially annoying since the game doesn't save as often, meaning you might end up re-playing 10-20 minutes every now and again (Quick Save often!!).   I really recommend this game. If you aren't a fan of the combat system, you should give it a shot anyways since you get used to it fairly quickly. For $2 (when on sale) the game is worth a shot.",

It ran perfectly on Windows 7 64 bit being such an old game. I completed the entire game without running into any glitch or bug while exploring all areas and completing all side quests. There are a few things which annoyed me at first such as combat style, quest map markers and the lack of explanation or warnings (maybe caused I skipped most of the conversations and logs), but all these are simply minor set backs. A few visits to Wikia and all your doubts will be sorted out.  The combat style, unlike convention hack and slash RPG, requires you to time your attack to execute a series of combos. Graphics are great and this game supports 1920 x 1080 resolution. The story is broken into chapters being different map area on different chapters. Size of maps are quite alright and music plays nicely on the background without being annoying.",

Backlogging this until I have the patience to deal with the combat mechanics. Luckily I bought it on sale. I will edit this review if I ever summon the will power to play it again.  Review Edit: 5/15/15: I found some time to get back into this game... the combat is still the weak point but after FORCING myself to play this a bit more, I can get past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat style and will give the game a go. So far the story is opening up nicely. I will say it is worth trying but only if you can handle the combat. The gfx are a bit dated and some of the sounds are silly and out of place but the voice acting isn't too bad. I have noticed a trend in my quests though... they are definitely repetitive but some of the areas are nice look at/explore.  I would now say... yes definitely play this game for about 2 hours and you will get past some quirks and become curious about some of the story... Hopefully by the end of this, I am interested in the rest of the trilogy.",

Story : the plot was amazing, I was encaptivated by the plot, I was thrilled I could make my OWN decision and felt my own decisions made an impact on the gameplay, and story. I was my own witcher, I was my version of Geralt, and that made the game play extremely personalized to me, and made me feel much more apart of the story. I couldn't wait to make my next decision, to be my own witcher and choose what I would do in pressurized situations.  Gameplay: The combat system was awesome, different, amazing. I enjoyed it. I found it challenging enough to want to achieve more, but not too difficult that I would get fustrated and quit the game.   Graphics : I have the enchanced edition so the graphics were pretty good for when the game was relased, they werent terrible, they were alright , characters looked good,   Sex booze and drugs: As a female player, these things really made the story for me, again it wasmy own life, I could choose to have sex with some girls, (I generally chose to all the time) I was able to go to an inn and ♥♥♥♥ plastered if I wanted too, the game gave me the freedom of 'real life' and that is quite important in these types of games.  Overall amazing game, nothing to loose if youre interested in beasts, fantasy , medevial and more.  By far one of my favourite games ever.",

I didn't think so at first but after playing Witcher 2 and remembering what a real combat style in a real time game is like I realized how much I ABSOLUTELY HATE the combat style. You have ZERO control over whether you dodge, parry, etc. You click on the enemy and then wait for the AI to carry out whatever moves it decides you should get. It's complete and utter GARBAGE. The majorly redeeming quality of this game is the story. The Witcher is based off some novels so it has an established world with it's own history, characters, etc. Then there is the romance cards. This is the only game I have ever played where getting laid is a part of the game. Each chapter has a certain set of women that the Witcher can bed. The cut scene itself is not graphic in any way, the cards you get in your inventory are unbelievably hot though. The choice of paths isn't really anything new to gaming, but this choice of paths dictates which women you get to sleep with and will heavily modify the story experience for the player. All these gimmicks don't add up to anything less than a s h i t game with a great story. I am ONLY recommending this game because you get to make chasing tail part of the main game.",

The story in this game is fairly decent, and there are some moments when you may be surprised.  However, if you play the game on Hard, prepare yourself for frustration.  Not because the game is truly that challenging, but because some bugs can make it impossible to beat certain bosses unless you force yourself to farm areas multiple times for alchemy ingredients and xp.  For example, during the final stretch to the end of the game, I had a consistent bug that made it impossible to cast magic. If you're playing on Hard then magic is your friend. However, I was completely unable to cast magic, even with more than adequate endurance (spell casting resource) and no negative effects on me to prevent casting. This made the last three big fights of the game incredibly difficult, as you are easily beaten by bosses even if you have upgraded armor and potions.  If it weren't for the bugs this game has, this game would easily get an 8 out of 10 from me.   If you pick up this game, I'd recommend you play on Normal, as the bugs I experienced are common and make a Hard playthrough nigh impossible.  Pros: The story is interesting The universe is quite immersive There are plenty of sidequests that influence the main quests, so you're hardly ever questing just to quest You can feel the difference of difficulty as you level up and get stronger  Cons: Bugs are common in this game, gamebreaking or not There is a TON of running back and forth (travel gets much easier for a time in chapter 2 and 3) A Hard playthrough WILL frustrate you to no end if you get the magic bug There are frequent game crashes (at least 2 to 3 crashes for every few hours of gameplay. Seems to be worse when fighting mages)  TL;DR: This game is great, but steel yourself if you have to play games on Hard. The combat bugs are manageable on Normal, however. If you can deal with the bugs and crashes (maybe you won't crash as often as I did), then this game is fantastic, in my opinion. I hope you enjoy it if you do decide to pick it up! :)",

So I had to pull some strings and scour the enternet in order to find a way to fix it. ( I went into properties and chose launch set up and hat to type in -dontusespecreq or something like that to override what was stopping me. I'm still limited graphically though because i have an awesome graphics card, yet it won't let me put texture quality up, it remains all the way down. While the rest of the sliders are all the way to the right set on ultra. So other than compatibility issues, which somebody should fix if possible, the game is very good considering when it was made.

So many quests and directions, you have to just pick a random quest off your list and go to the next objective. A bit disorienting sometimes.  3) Open-world, but not quite. The game is split into chapters, and once out of said chapter, you can't go back. Except that some quests span multiple chapters. It can get confusing.   4) It's a bit buggy and can therefore crash often. But saves aren't restricted. Save often.   The good: 1) The combat is clunky, but that makes it pretty easy to master. About three seconds into a fight, I can tell which way it's going to go -- whether I'm going to survive, and whether I need to adapt.  2) There's lots and lots of story. You get dropped into the middle of this man's life; trying to figure out both his past and determining his future. Your actions have consequences, your choices have outcomes. It's horribly confusing and disorienting sometimes; but if you jump in with both feet you'll find yourself mesmerized and unable to put it down.   3) Atmospheric as ♥♥♥♥. People have schedules and routes. Guards follow a route at night, townspeople spend their days inside at work, go to the bar afterwards, and to their homes after that. People huddle under rooves and complain about the rain as it pours. Some disapprove of your weapons, others thank you for your help as you pass. Monsters become more aggressive &amp; numerous at night. Guards tell you you're weird for being out so late.   4) Trophy system. Certain monsters are legendary in areas and fetch a high price. If you manage to down it, people want proof. You carry the head with you until turning it in to claim your reward.   Honorable mentions: 1) Yes, you can have sex with many women. Yes, you get to collect cards from encounters. There is a romance system (a bit shallow, but still there), I quite like it. It blends in very well with Geralt's life and the game in general. Also, you can choose a permanent gf that carries over into next game.  2) Mods. Bugfixes, UI overhauls, even one to fix the distasteful combat system (I myself dont' mind it, but many do). Also, you can update the textures and even introduce and ENB to update the look some.   9.5/10 I LOVE this game. I can't wait to finish it and see what the next game will show me. I'll probably play through both of these games again before Wild Hunt comes out. If you're thinking about getting this game but are unsure, give it a try.

It's a solid experience overall with the graphics are very visually stunning for the scenes and it plays very well once you've passed your minor 'adjustment' period to the controls and should the story really grab your interest you won't even notice the small issues that occasionally crop up. Definately worth the price tag if your up for a good story driven game where you can do as little or as many of the optional tasks available but still not feel underwhelming coming toward the end of the game if you chose to skip things. I wouldn't say it's for everyone it's not an immediate jump into it knowing everything, it does take a little while to get going but afterward it's well paced and thoroghly enjoyable.",

It is not you typical button mash game but a precise clicks and timed attacks which takes a bit of skill, but will later on will become second nature in terms of combat. If you get over the tutorial level, the game opens up with great areas to explore, different and interesting characters you will meet and the decisions you make will affect the outcome of the game later on. There is alchemy as well, which is fun and very useful to have but takes a while to get used to how the crafting the potions you will want works. For beginners, just collects any flower or anything you can find and search for the people that sell books that have ingredients, than eventually you will get the hang of crafting potions. The second last chapter is just so beautiful and more immersive then any other chapter in the game, trust me, you will love this series just for playing and exploring this chapter.

            "review_text": "I had heard about the Witcher series on a certain forum and as it was praised for it's amazing story and gameplay I decided to look into it as I fancy RPG games. Totally worth it.  The game is rather long, there are many choices (and consequences for every decision) which shouldn't be taken lightly as they're often hard to make, especially if you get immersed in the story. Controversal and moral topics discussed, your decisions questioned.  You play as Geralt of Rivia, a witcher - a professional monster slayer for hire. But nothing is as simple as that. Even though you are a monster slayer, whose job is to protect humans (and non-humans), there are those who have plans of their own for the future of the kingdom. The most of the story is set in Vizima, one of the towns in the kingdom of Temeria, but you'll be traveling to some other unique places as you progress. Captivating, non-linear story and a lot of side quests, relatively big and open-world search and traveling will keep you busy for a while.  As for the gameplay itself, you will be facing a lot of different opponents and all of them will require a different approach to combat and different strategies in order to be beaten (especially bosses). You wield swords - steel and silver ones. The first is used against non-monster creatures while the latter becomes useful against abominations. You utilize the mastery of swordmanship utmost and different styles/stances to prevail in all situtations and conflicts. You also possess a certain amount of knowledge about magic as you are able to cast Witcher Signs which are classified as simple magic, but they sure come in handy nonetheless. A witcher is also a master of alchemy. You're able to brew a variety of potions in order to enhance your abilities and ensure dominance in combat. (Many other interesting / optional stuff is available in the game, too. Some of those would be: Mini-games, crafting, collecting, enchanting, love, etc.)  As for the graphics, the game looks relatively out-dated, but don't let that turn you away from this amazing piece of software. The game is rather breathtaking at times considering the year of it's release date.  If you like RPG games with great story, character development, unique combat (not everyone will like this, but you can get used to it rather fast - just be patient) and all of that while while experiencing a great adventure, you should give this game a try. You won't regret it.",

The Witcher is the best place to start for those who have seen the Witcher 3 advertised and thought it looked good while having not played The Witcher 2.  One thing I can say about the Witcher, it's like a long lost cousin to Dark Souls. This means that the game won't be easy, and it really won't. For example, the games first major boss (in the Witcher) is a demon hound, this is a spiritual beast, meaning that the most effective weapon to use is the trade mark Witcher's silver sword. But guess what? You don't have one of those when you fight the demon hound! Why? Play tha game and find out!  But yes, the game is mean enough to pit you off against a nasty demon dog, one which causes you damage just by being next to you, alongside protecting this hot witch you just banged minutes before the fight (if you chose to defend Abigail after banging her, that is! You can be a buttmunch and let the mob kill her. Yay for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ choices!) and despite knowing the best way to kill it, the game just goes 'HA! Good luck! You are F**KED!'. But here's the thing, for those who actually understand the game and how it works will be able to devise an idea where you will not be royaly screwed from the side!  It took me countless tries, even rage quitting the game for a whole year, having it uninstalled, reinstalling it, not remembering why I left it to begin with, got butt stuffed by the demon hound again and was just like 'Oh, yeah... now I remember.' to only keep going at it with determination, a lot of use of the quick save and quick load function as well as the in game combat pause mechanic (akin to the Dragon Age series, which I'm sure many of you are fans of, like myself!) and I eventually killed that BEAST of a boss! ... Only to find out right after me and abigail got swarmed by an angry mob and I had to defend her yet again... she died... FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU****************************KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!  I'm a stickler for having to pull off my plans as well as I always play the hero when it comes to games. Fallout 3, Skyrim, Dragon Age, you name it, I've been the hero. But this game literally takes your chioces, be them better choices or nasty ones, and it literally goes 'No, no, no... You're thinking this is going to give you a fun outcome? You gotta work for it ♥♥♥♥♥♥!' before smacking you in face.  It's not easy, it's not an overly pleasant game (meaning the story is dark and can be depressing at times, not in any way meaning it's a terrible game!), it's long and challenging and will definitely take some getting used to. But it's one of those rare gems of a game where you just don't know why, but you can't bring yourself to look down on it. Why? Because this game is awesome. Simples!  As said at the start of this nerdgasm, it's good to begin here, and then if you're hooked, move onto The Witcher 2, which is just as challenging as the first, if not more so, and then after that, The Witcher 3 (which will be just as challenging as the first two!) and just cry with joy that you were able to be alive in the time that these epic games were made. :3",

The combat system is now one of my favorites in any game - balancing your level of poison against potions, spending points to develop the many sword and magic skills, slicing through groups of mobs like butter, all of it made me want more of this game.  I played through Witcher and then Witcher 2 in about a month and I am now very eagerly awaiting the third installment.

The first chapter, I think the fans now have all agreed is a test, it is slow moving, simple and takes a lot of running around to do, however what I think it does well is that it teaches you how to hunt monsters, and how the mechanics work properly while still making character choices! The game after that does pick up, with a wide range of areas and even wider range of characters! There is also the collectible card game included with each new women you have a special encounter with (and by that I mean, sex. They are sex cards....)   Graphically it is rough at edges, but it is a forgivable offence as the game itself is quite old! I personally didn't have any issues playing it!

            "review_text": "First thing you need to know: If you consider yourself an RPG fan at all, get The Witcher. Heck, if you're a fan of fantasy in general, get The Witcher.   TL;DR: People say this game is unrefined and awkward, and they're sort of right, but the real reason to play this game is the story. Let me make clear that this game has THE BEST story I've ever seen in a game. It loses a bit of steam around chapter 2, but afterward it just keeps getting better. How many games have you finished, only to think afterward, 'the game was good, but the ending was kind of disappointing'? How many have you finished and thought, 'What an interesting, satisfying ending'? Probably almost none. Kudos to The Witcher for providing a personal, self-contained story with an incredible twist at the end that's not in any way sequel-bait. Although believe me, you'll definitely want to play the sequel.   Actual review:  The combat may be an acquired taste, and it may not have the same level of exploration as something like Skyrim, but as a story,'The Witcher is the best I've seen in any game. The setting is somewhat archetypical, filled with nature-loving elves with pointy ears and dwarves with huge beards and a lust for gold--pretty much the epitome of a stereotypical fantasy world. It even borrows things from the classic King Arthur legends. But it's the perfect setting for its personal, multi-faceted, complex narrative, and never ceases to be interesting.   If you've played Mass Effect, you'll be familiar with the game's dialogue system. Simmilar to those games, too, The Witcher has something of a moral choice system, only the choice system in The Witcher is better in almost every way. The choices don't pop up every 5 minutes like they do in Mass Effect, but when they do, they make you think. Hard. None of this is like 'press A to be good, B to be a jerk'-- everything is ambiguous and there are always good reasons to make either choice.   The way the quests are set up is interesting, too, because almost every quest ties back into another one in some way. What may at first seem like an unimportant side mission may later prove to play an integral part in the main story. It's an organic experience I haven't found anywhere else.   While the graphics are very dated, and probably weren't even that impressive when it first came out, the art style is beautiful and unique. Every loading screen, and some occasional cutscenes, have beautiful still pictures that look like they were oil-painted. It contrasts with the actual game, but still captures the overall feel. The music is great, too, and very unique, often using instruments I don't even know the name of.   The game's weak point is of course the combat. The idea is to click the mouse at exactly the right time to chain attacks together, and it's very easy to click at the wrong time and stop attacking without even realising it. Also, one mouse click usually results in several sword swings, which ends up making things feel unresponsive. It took me a couple hours to really 'get' it, but once I did it actually got pretty fun. The combat is VERY hard at times, but towards the end when Geralt has levelled up a lot, it actually gets too easy. The final mission was probably the easiest; I only remember dying there once or twice.   Bottom line is, if you're looking for a mature, story-driven RPG, The Witcher is as good as it gets. Except for The Witcher 2, of course. But that, as good ol' Dandelion would say, is another story.",

It seems like most choices aren't based off the normal good and bad scale. it seems the choices are based off a bad or worse scale. do you save a girl and slaughter a town trying to kill her or do you kill the girl and save the town who is convinced that she is evil? the crafting system was cool too. im a huge fan of using everything to create something. Drinking is fun the first few times. the only place this game fails is combat (the Witcher 2 has a very similar problem.) the combat gets very old very fast and infact the combat system is more of a frustration than anything else in the game which is worrysome as RPG games have 2 things fighting and talking. I think the game would have been better without the combat system than it is with it, which is funny because how would you solve disputes? I'd give the game a 6/10 and that is generous due to the FUBAR combat system. anything but combat seems very well polished and well done. id recommend it unless you only play RPG games to fight and hate story lines.",

            "review_text": "The first Time I saw this game, I was like... 17, and all of the sudden, most gaming magazines of the time started bombarding us -readers - with this brilliant rpg made by a polish studio.  As I had the crappiest PC at the time, i was pining at this game from afar, reading the gloating reviews, and all neat things you could do with it.  A while ago, while cruising the sales section, i found it for about 1,5$ and bought it.  Started playing it and I gotta say, in the end it was a mixed bag of emotions:  Resuming, it has a great story, and a great concept, lots of things to do, but the maps can be too big, an the gameplay is a bit inconsistent. If we add the bugs, it takes some value out of it.  It's a great experience if you love storytelling (that alone would give it like a 9 or a 10), not so great, if you expect a gameplay to go with it.  7/10  And here's why:  Pros:  Story Telling -  Choices, Choices Choices. For the time when this was originally released -and since the story did not changed a bit with the enhanced version, it's stil the same -, about 2007, it is really surprising seeying how much your choices and decisions affect your gameplay overall. If you choose to help one NPC, he may help you later, and so and so,this for me was the strong point of the whole game, allied to the detail that the progress can be transferred to the next game - which I'll play later, and that actually gives you a sense of purpose, I mean, so many choices - I found myself really torn about which choice to make - actually have an impact in the rest of the game.  10/10  Open world:  You can basically roam everywhere - loot random houses, sleep with random girls and collect 'love cards', if you like that sort of thing in a game, but overall it's really a nice open world.  7/10  Gameplay - Okay, not the actual gameplay -as sometimes the combat is not as fluid as it claims to be -, but most of the concepts. Like the idea that you have to use different weapons to different sorts of enemies, steel for human enemies, silver for magical enemies, or the crafting of bombs and potions that prove themselves really useful/necessary. 8/10  Sidequests - If you love sidequests,  There's millions of them. Some may prove useful to the main story, as you gain lore knowledgement/ recipees / magical Items, and experience.  6/10  Cons:  Tecnhical Problems - I know that the base game is from 2007 and all that, but the enhanced version should have somehow taken them away. I mean, I got to the point in which I saved every 10 minutes, as Randomly the game would simply crash and force close after a boss battle or some 100 miles walk. I tried reinstalling it, checking files integrity, but nothing fixed those damned bugs, and it was really annoying playing something and thinking most of the time 'i need to save, otherwise I'll just have to replay this all over again' - i've lost one or two hours of gameplay due to this fact alone.  4/10  Maps - Okay, so, I know it's an open world and all that but the maps can be SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO huge. take the swamps for example. You have part of the main quest in one edge of the map, and then you have to walk to the other edge, to do the rest of it, and the map isn't always helpful.  You'll feel frustrated after a while, as you're not actually doing nothing some of the time, just making the same route back and forth time and time again. Sometimes you're going the right way, through a blessed shortcut you'll eventually find, but the map points the other way, and if you follow it, you'll just go the longest way possible. It's just as if the dev wanted us to roam forever in this open, open, really wide opened world, and I do believ most people that dropped out the game, did it during the 2nd/3rd chapter, the ones when this happened really often.  3/10  Inconsistency - So, you'll have areas with 2/3 enemies once in a while, then suddenly they're in gangs of 20, and then there's no enemies whastoever, it does not increase with the progression of the history. nope . I remember in the 5th chapter, I actually wanted to find an enemy before the last battle - or so I thought - and I had to go bak 3 areas, as everything was just deserted. The bosses feel the same way. You have a boss that you have to kill a particular way, and that actually gives you some challenge, then the next is killed with 2/3 attacks, then the next takes you lots of effort, and it goes on pretty much like this. Most bosses are really easy - *spoiler * like the striga. I mean, cmon, she's supposed to be super fast, challenging and strong and she's just the clunkyest boss in the whole game * spoiler*. It may have some explanation but I just don't get it.  3/10  And I just have to do an honorable mention to the models. There was a time at the game, when I actually did not knew with which NPC i was talking as they were pretty much the same base model with different accessories xD",

            "review_text": "Finally it is done... I stopped playing this game about 5 hours in at first because i think i just simply wasn't in the mood.. i'm not one to abandon a game so i carried on a few weeks later.. it eventually got to the point where i could not play ANYTHING else or do ANYTHING productive until it was completed... and now i feel like a mere husk of a man who doesn't quite no what he wants to play next..  GAMEPLAY:  A cracking RPG with lots of side quests and things to do, it's not all just fighting big scary monsters, you can go from playing poker to picking on all the fat people in taverns, an easy to use inventory system and absolutely fantastic encyclopedia of everything, everyplace and everyone you meet, which is truly useful to the game and immersing the player into the world of The Witcher. At points it can seem as though you are wandering for far too long, running around the place getting bits and bobs.. this is because the game is without a fast track system.. although i don't mind that, for me it made me impatient to go to the next chapter due to the fact i had walked the same routes 15 times and just wanted to do something else  COMBAT:  Easy to Pick up and easy to master, at times the motion of clicking your mouse button can seem repetitive BUT the animations for combat are always fresh and the further into the game you go the better they get, with different styles of attack for different enemy types you will be having to plan out your attacks and prepare for battles ahead using potions, bombs and the correct sword, there is more than enough to keep you on your toes. Sometimes moving Geralt mid combat can be clunky but this is only a minor issue  VISUALS:  My computer isn't the best and couldn't run this on high.. but that's my computer i imagine most would be able to.. even with my settings on medium The Witcher was a beautiful game with new and interesting locations varying from bright and colourful to dark and ominous. The art and design gone into all the creatures and landscapes is unique and the cards which i can only call... Sexy Souvenirs... are something at first you giggle at but when you actually look at them with an appreciation, you'll see they are beautifully drawn.  AUDIO:  The music used in the witcher during peaceful times, is always tranquil and feels very medieval/rennaisance, when it all hits the fan and theres monsters left, right and centre, the heavy rockier combat music is a delight at times and can sometimes really insue a panic on the player. Characters dialog is also very well delivered with Geralt's voice always calm and steely, an Evil sorcerer with an almost James Earl Jones voice. Monsters grunts and grumbles however aren't always as unique with most 4 footed creatures roaring and most 2 legged floaty ones, screeching.  STORY:   The Story stayed very consistent in it's delivery and pace always having an air of mystery to it and always keeping the player entertained, at certain points it had an almost Film Noire vibe in a medieval backdrop which i found quite refreshing. At times you felt quite attached to characters and feared whether your actions had consequences on the characters... which i can only hold to good character development created by the script. The decisions you make in the game can affect how it all ends... (so i believe... i've only played it once)   RATING:  I give 'The Witcher' 8 out of 10 as i believe there is always room for improvement.. but more because the lengthy walking, at times, slowed the pace of the game for me and took me out of immersion   ",

If you do choose to stay, i guarantee you will not stop until you beat the game, because it is that good. The developers and writers set up the game so perfectly. You are Geralt and you are the witcher who fights monsters in defense of humans and non-humans. Your choices do matter and they do effect the later outcomes and relationships.

There is no other word for it. The game is gorgeous. So much detail went into this game that it looks like you're in another world. The landscape literally looks like you could live there. It's almost hard to believe the game is 8 years old. It's definitely better than some of the crap on the market today  Gameplay: Very fluid. Conversations are, for the most part, very beneficial and only further develop the story. The NPCs that do not converse don't have much influence over the game, but some are still funny. With regards to combat - it's rough. Definitely the worst part of the game, but that isn't saying a lot. The sword positioning is ridiculous, and almost comical. The spells looked like they didn't do much. You can't hardly dodge while fighting, and the combat was confusing at first, but was easily discovered and explained early in the game. Do NOT let this part dissuade you from purchasing the game. Combat is a big part of this game, but it does not make this game unplayable.  Sound: Like the graphics, the designers did a phenomenal job. The voice acting was very well done, despite there not being very many voice actors. With the huge game this is though, it's hard to get hundreds of people with whom you can trust to do as good a job as the actors voicing characters in this game. The music is beautiful as well. Perfect for every scenario and situation.  Overall, one of the best games I've played, console or PC, and I've prided myself a collector of a variety of console games. Well deserving of the 8.5/10. Some work still to be done, but overall a great game. Definitely recommend and would play again.",

If you simply want to blow through this game simply because you want to see the begining, read on.  Long story short the game is good but has VERY annoying features that would frustrate those who are trying to speed through using melee. The game often throws 10-15 enemies at once later in the game and many enemies can stun for 6 seconds and can chain it. Also dodging is not very useful and counterplay against hard bosses is almost non-existant.   However, investing many skill points in to Signs(spells) can make the game easier, though almost too easy.  In conclusion if you want a long lasting experience full of content and interesting characters and story, buy the game at its current price. If you want to just go through the game as fast as possible, get it on sale. (On sale you can get both Witcher 1 and 2 for $5)",

            "review_text": "Adapted from the Polish folklore and fantasy novel series, comes the tale of Geralt of Rivia, The Witcher. In this game you'll be playing as Geralt who is a 'Witcher', a monster slayer. This game takes place after the novel, 'The Last Wish', and has Geralt hunting down a notorious gang called 'Salamandra' as he uncovers secrets about the world while learning about himself and his past. The game shares the same engine as Mass Effect 1, and concentrates highly on conversations and use of skills. You'll be using sword-styles to fight groups, fast enemies, or big enemies. The quest log provided takes a small amount of fiddling with, but is no more difficult to track quests and display your destinations as it is in Skyrim. Alchemy is entertaining to mess with, creating actually useful items and potions made from things you've found or plants you've picked.  The skill tree gets pretty in depth as you create what kind of Witcher Geralt will become and what skills he will have. Will he be an all out brawler who's strength increases as he drinks ale? Or will he be a cunning mage? Howabout a deft swordsman with many trades? You decide. Looting is also present in The Witcher, so if you're a fan of perusing cubbords, pantries, and entire houses and dungeons of any and all possible treasure you'll be a happy camper in the world of The Witcher. Camera options are interesting, as you have the choice to play over-the-shoulder like many third person games, or have a top-down isometric view where you point and click Geralt's every move. The music in The Witcher is okay, nothing really memorable, but not irritating or too repetitive.  All in all The Witcher is a pretty entertaining adventure. Its easy to play it and feel similarities to Dragon Age, maybe, but in all its pretty unique. My only gripes would be that I wished there was a little more to the combat, (it does get a little repetitive) and that the voice acting was a little bit better. Some children shouldn't sound like mature adults, and some npcs get a little awkward at times. Also, if older tech is a deal-breaker for you than this may not be the game for you. There is a level of forgiveness here you'll have to have while playing, as the game is pretty dated looking. Released in 2007, its practically the quality of a PlayStation 2 game rather than a title that compares with most games of 2007 during the HD gaming revolution period. It would have been nice if there was some sort of Fast Travel, even though the maps aren't TOO big, there are times when quests require you to run back and forth in places like the Outskirts of Vizina? (sp?) where you run back and forth across the entire map to NPCs. But its not too hard to deal with since you often find items running back and forth. Anything odd, glitchy, or awkward isn't usually a bad thing, and sometimes adds some hilarity to the mix. Its one of those games where anything thats not that great can be funny.  Don't let the 'Enhanced Edition' name fool you, there's a reason why thats the only version on Steam. The original game was very terrible, so the 'Enhanced Edition' made it actually enjoyable. Look for a list of changes from the original to the Enhanced Edition on wiki, its quite amazing.  If graphics and older tech don't matter to you and you're looking for something new in this genre then you should totally give this game a try. ESPECIALLY if you're planning on playing The Witcher 2 and 3.  +Unique Story +Skill Tree +Geralt is a badass +Quest Log +Alchemy  -Voice Acting -No fast travel -Very simple graphics for a 2007 game  I give it an honest 7.5/10",

I just finished the first one because I didn't wanna skip and wanted to enjoy the story. It was definitely worth it.  This review is from 2015/2016 season  Pros: - for how old the game is, the graphics are still good - great story - Prologue and Chapter 1 were great introduction - Chapter 5 and Epilogue were definitely great ending - Chapter 5 and Epilogue were definitely the best from the game - very good music - the cities and locations felt alive - awesome atmosphere - when you get used to the combat, it's fun - you don't only use your swords but also magic - you can wield the iconic swords through whole game, the gearing is mostly on the talents if you want - good and many various enemies - your choices matter - good voice acting, actually hours and hours of it - fun secondary quests  Cons: - many, many same friendly NPC used over and over again just with different name and VO - too much inivisible walls - inventory system - eventhough the HP recovery system brings different type of challenge, it became more of annoying then challenge - Chapter 3 was just unbearable. Too long and not that interesting. - you need to get used to the combat - you don't gear much from gears, but since you wanna use the badass Witcher sword anyway, it's actually good thing - sometimes you really need to have the right potions, otherwise you're dead and can't move - many loading screens, but they were fast, so it was ok - some of the quests were go here, go across two maps, oh and go back and go there again, which we hate big time  I could go even more to details what I liked and didn't like but I think you got the idea. It's really good game and for me the Chapter 5 and Epilogue went 8/10, but the full game is:  7/10 Good game!!  I enjoyed this. Can't wait to play the next ones.",

But don't let it put you off, it developes a pace as the time goes on and you'll have a lot of things to do. And to mention, it's a pretty lenghty game. I was taking my time to enjoy it and it took me more than 50 hours to complete all the side quests, and it didin't dissapoint me a single bit.

At first you feel out of place because the game mechanics are weird, especially if you are not an RPG gamer, this game has something in particular that makes it a little bit hard to play and get used to it. But in time, you start to recognize the game style, once you do that, you get absorbed by the storyline and you have nothing else but to finish it.   The Witcher is based on a very famous Polish novel, therefore the complexity of the game. During the journey you develop a lot of abilities and get new missions over and over again, your moral and decisions have future consequences, you must choose sides or stay neutral so the story keeps on developing with different reactions of character and missions.   Graphics are decent for an RPG game, though I think here is not that important, what could make you feel bad, is not learning the fighting style and modes they offer to battle different enemies, you have endless amount of ingredients to create potions and generate new powers, it is a great experience, with a complex plot that will take you to a whole new level on RPG's, if you like these kind of games, pick it up and play it, and play it a lot, because it offers a lot of replay value.

Right-click the shortcut, click properties and edit the target window by moving the cursor to the end (after the quotation mark), hitting the spacebar once, and then typing this exactly: -dontForceMinReqs  If you neglect to add the space, or if you omit the - or if you change caps, the fix will not work. You should be able to now launch the game from the shortcut without issue.  Back to the game review, I am also a fan of controller support, and this game has none. Downside for me, but the KB+M setup works really well on this game. The graphics and storyline are great, and the inventory and mode selection mechanics work quite well, especially considering the somewhat labyrinthine gameplay architecture.  Highly recommendable, overall. I prefer it to the sequel, at this point, owing to the smoother (if somewhat less ambitious) gaming experience.  [Windows 8.1 ASUS x55a w Pentium2020 4GB RAM]",

The witcher Gerald of Rivia is in fact not some kind of superhero, but an outlaw, which make things in the fantasyworld even more interesting.

However, after pushing myself through those rough couple of acts, I found that the game was an interesting and engaging experience. There are several choices in the game that have significant impact on not only your survival, but also how the story pans out. While most decisions are made via dialogue, there are a few exceptions that are based soley on your actions which felt incredible. Unlike its sequel, the voice acting of everyone except Geralt is somewhat poor. The graphics are nice due to the artistic styling, but the character models are fairly bad. The combat is rythmic clicking versus the more Dark Souls inspired combat of the Witcher 2. I would pick this one up if you have patience and love a deep story.  [GET AT SALE]",

This game is certainly less polished than the sequel, but it feels bigger thanks to the huge number of sidequests and monster hunts.   Story is one of the big selling points for me; the core story avoids the political tomfoolery that punctuated a lot of Witcher 2's story beats and instead tells a simple tale of Geralt's hunt for some stolen Witcher formulas that eventually leads him into the middle of a war between the Scoia'tael and the Order of the Flaming Rose. Two things work in the first game's favour here; as well as the main story there's a large amount of sidequests that expand on the world and often include some interesting situations such as curing/killing a werewolf or battling a Striga. What's interesting is that many of the quests have alternate routes, and failing to investigate and learn about the monsters you're fighting can lead to extra information being lost.   The second thing in its favour, and something that I sorely missed in the sequel, is a pure neutral path. With virtually all of the major decisions in the game you can just refuse to pick a side and let the two sides to the war kill each other, only getting involved when thing's get personal.   There's also a fair bit of grinding and tons of weapons and other things to find; it's the kind of thing that will annoy many players, but for someone like me it just made the game even more alluring. Combat is fairly hit and miss though, but the flow and the expanding animations that come as you level up helped stave of boredom.   I personally love this game, but if you're looking to give it a go after playing the second or third games you'd better be prepared for a real rough-around-the-edges (to be honest, it's rough round the middle bits too) experience that very much feels like a game rather than an experience, but if you can persevere the world-building and storyline can more than make up for its shortcomings.",

The characters have original remarks, wants and needs, and story behind why they want these things. But there are also boss monsters, which usually aren't hack-n-slash. The game entices you to use your surroundings or alternate methods. Another HUGE feature of the game is the fact that, as you progress, you come to key decision points that, while possibly not blatantly obvious at the time (yet they may also be quite obvious, as characters may point it out) decide your fate and others' fates. Your actions for certain scenarios and how you handle them will decide who lives, who dies, how characters think of you, and what the world ultimately comes to.

This aside, the game is engaging, and once you get past its flaws, genuinely enjoyable. It starts to pick up in chapter 3, and feeling a connection to Geralt that you've built over 3-4 chapters of gameplay really pays off in the end, it feels very solid and gratifying and you know that you have made a difference in the world and in your version of Geralt.

It is not you typical button mash game but a precise clicks and timed attacks which takes a bit of skill, but will later on will become second nature in terms of combat. If you get over the tutorial level, the game opens up with great areas to explore, different and interesting characters you will meet and the decisions you make will affect the outcome of the game later on. There is alchemy as well, which is fun and very useful to have but takes a while to get used to how the crafting the potions you will want works. For beginners, just collects any flower or anything you can find and search for the people that sell books that have ingredients, than eventually you will get the hang of crafting potions. The second last chapter is just so beautiful and more immersive then any other chapter in the game, trust me, you will love this series just for playing and exploring this chapter.

Being an older game, the graphics can't really compare to a modded Skyrim, but they hold up surprisingly well still. Where this game really shines though is the story, and the choices you're given along the way. I felt much more invested in Geralt of Rivia, and had a sense that my in-game actions actually had consequences. In a lot of games I find myself tuning out during cutscenes, and just wanting to get back to the action, but The Witcher kept me engaged til the end.  My biggest criticism is probably combat, which is pretty simplistic, and can thus be a little boring at times. Apart from deciding which sword and combat style to use, there's not much to it - just click to attack, then wait til the right time to attack again.  Ultimately though, this isn't a huge issue, as the richness of the world and narrative more than makes up for it.  I should also mention that this game allows you to try and get laid lots, which no doubt many will enjoy... :)",

MIND = BLOWN, some of the facts and the connections between characters were amazing. The fact that I read the books beforehand really enhanced my experience since there were so many characters that were thoroughly portrayed in the books, yet briefly explained in the game. The complexity of this game lies within the choices and moral struggles of Geralt, who is always thrown in the middle of politics, love affairs and monster hunting. This game describes a world coated in several shades of gray, where nobody is completely innocent. Good and bad are intertwined and there's always the possibility to awake the bad in people and release havoc in the world.  In terms of gameplay, Witcher didn't offer an amazing experience. Besides the obvious crafting of potions and different talent skill trees, the game lacked the possibility of crafting weapons and armors, but it didn't ruin the overall experience. What I absolutely loved was the realistic depiction of sword fights, and you have plenty of those in the game. There's more than just your average swing and damage your opponent. Geralt fights with precision and dexterity, sometimes he fights hard and focuses on dealing crazy amounts of damage against foes, and sometimes he moves as graceful as a cat and performs a subtle yet ravaging dance. No other game made me enjoy the fighting as much as Witcher, there's art in the movements, they were fluid, they were unique.  The story is very well put together, neither far fetched, nor boring. The world is intriguing and adapts to your decisions, the game really takes its time to address your decisions and reflect on them as you advance through the game. In terms of music, the soundtrack fits the mood of the game perfectly. ( You do find yourself lost in the tavern on more than one occasion, but maybe that's just me. tongue emoticon )  I personally give this game 9.7/10 score. I am looking forward to experiencing the other Witcher games and I am quite excited to do so.",

I don\\'t agree with what a lot of people say about the combat system being bad, I loved it. Just clicking at the right times to hit targets with the sword may seem boring, but you have to bear in mind that there are tons of different potions, sword oils and bombs you can use, adding a tactic element and a need for preparation and knowledge about your enemy before actually getting into the fight. I loved this, as I thought it was very in line with the modus operandi of a witcher.  And the story... it has made me think for days after finishing it. I felt like my choices mattered, and always had an uneasy uncertainty about whether I had chosen the right thing. And about the ending...    the final revelation of the Master of the order being Alvin (who travelled back in time) was completely heartbreaking, and something that I didn\\'t see at all coming, even if they give some clues here and there. I know this hasn\\'t been confirmed, but I think it was pretty obvious.      Other stuff:     I thought getting cards for every woman you had sex with was a bit of a misogynistic and immature thing, something that was strange for an otherwise very mature game.     I loved the way the game presented modern problems and tropes (terrorism, moral relativism, genocide...) in a medieval fantasy setting.

The game often throws 10-15 enemies at once later in the game and many enemies can stun for 6 seconds and can chain it. Also dodging is not very useful and counterplay against hard bosses is almost non-existant.   However, investing many skill points in to Signs(spells) can make the game easier, though almost too easy.  In conclusion if you want a long lasting experience full of content and interesting characters and story, buy the game at its current price. If you want to just go through the game as fast as possible, get it on sale. (On sale you can get both Witcher 1 and 2 for $5)",

I appreciated the fact that inventory was limited, too often in games you end up with page after page of junk you just hang onto out of habit, here you choose carefully or sell it. The potion brewing is a crucial element, if you pay attention to it you can get some serious buffs etc, if you don't, you're gonna get seriously familiar with the combat mechanic and probably have a bad time.   Combat itself is interesting. It's almost part QTE where you must time your strikes precisely, and part puzzle, where choosing the right setup will make a big difference. Where it suffers is movement. You can see what they were trying to do, the move set and style of the character are straight out of a classic sword fighting movie. Unfortunately it's a bit too clunky to make it work fluently much of the time. Fighting mobs is a gamble even if your set up is good as you can easily get cornered and destroyed in short order, particularly in mobs with mixed fighting styles.   I personally found quest management frustrating at first, it's managed almost like the books the games are based on. One chapter flows into the next and quite often a quest is left hanging until you can pick it up again later. It's an interesting approach but until you familiarise yourself with the system it can be overwhelming, with tons of half finished threads you have to wade through to find the stuff that's relevant. I'd advise anyone playing this first time to tinker with this until you're happy, It *is* very configurable.  The only other gripe I have is one that is likely to trip you up again and again. Invisible walls. This is hands down the most frustrating part of the game as you can do nothing about it. Everything else is a learning process or something you can adapt to. Not this. All I can say is be aware of it and choose your fights carefully.  Overall, despite the gripes I find it hard to really criticise this game. It's got everything you want in a solid RPG. Interesting characters, good writing, atmospheric locations, decisions that make a difference (Triss is no longer talking to me....) and more. It's believable, which is rare for any game. The use of old myths and folklore give you a real sense that it might have actually happened in ages past. The vast majority of encounters are embedded in this world view, giving them a reason to exist, rather than just an endless series of random encounters to keep you busy. It's very, very clever and not one you want to miss.",

I Loved the Witcher 3 as well and have played it multiple times. I decided to play this game as well to complete the trilogy.   I bought it on a steam sale for 1.5$. A steal for sure. However, I do recommend buying it for the gull price, which is 10$.   About the game. It's old. The graphics don't look particularly impressive. The animations look ridiculous. Some older games have better looking graphics and animations, like Half-Life 2 (but I feel comparing this to that game is unfair since Valve was already big that time and that Half-Life 2 was a game way ahead of its time, but I digress), the combat is system isn't that great either.   So, why would you want this game? The story. The storytelling. The quest design. Attention to details. If you like RPGs like I do, if you like your choices to matter, if you want a great story, this game is for you. I put 50 hours in it, completing almost every quest the game had. It's very addictive, like a good book. Play it. For the story.   Also. Make sure to read the books too. They're amazing. There are many refrences to the books in this game and you'd miss them if you don't read the book.   And if you finally decided to play this game, make sure to get 'Rise of The White Wolf' Mod. Makes the interface much better.  Very recommended, specially for Witcher fans.",

I found myself enjoying W3 so much that I wanted to maximize my understandment of the story by going back to finish both games before continuing, and so far I can check one game off the list. This game took me a long time to warm up to. 18 hours to be exact. Part of that had to do with playing in overhead camera mode, which took away from the immersion (which is essential to a game like this) and made everything feel sluggish. I strongly reccomend playing in over-the-shoulder mode (which I think is on by default). I am convinced I wouldve enjoyed this game much sooner had I sticked to the default camera angle. However, once I became immersed/interested in the story and the became invested in the characters, this game did a complete 180 for me and I became hooked. While the graphics and objective visual presentation might seem dated and sub par,you'll soon forget it because the story's execution is marvelous. This is a game that will wrap you in it's world and blind you from the visual shortcomings.  The combat is a bit strange. The actual sword fighting mechanic is barebones as hell, but some much needed complexity comes from choosing your weapon and fighting style depending on your enemy. This and the addition of spells and potions allows the combat to become way less monotmous than it has any right to be. This game is the kind you'll want to dive deep into, the kind of game you have dreams about in your sleep. The world is gripping, but it requires some patience. This is a long game that doesn't end when you initially think it would, but the endearment of discovering what lies ahead will keep you focused. There is a lot of walking so learn shortcuts around the world, and learn places of meditation to make time go by quicker. Once you learn the game and understand the clockwork, you'll fall in love.",

            "review_text": "(spoiler free)   The rule of thumb of story games: The decisions made in a story game will not always have a crucial effect of any kind, but if you're lucky; it might. At the very least the power of choice gives the illusion of freedom. Like the walking dead games, they are about the interactions of the characters, whether you wish to make peace, or cause drama. Though from the story narrative, nothing will exactly change the future outcomes that will happen.   But in the case of the witcher, there is momentum with some of the quests you do for some of the secondary characters, but only to a small degree. Most of these are mostly mundane, are highly optional to your playstyle. YOU, yes you, can essentially go by two different play styles from certain decisions you can make in the game. Slayer, you side with humans in every case, you were made to protect people from the threat of magical entities. Sympathizer you side with magical entities that might be innocent of their crimes. Most of which border on the grey territory of morality. Though neutrality is an option, it hinders you in the later stages of the game.   Now I will state the questing system is as broken as you can get in this game, you will never really know where to go, or know of any other option that could be available, many times I have failed a quest in a previous chapter due to the fact that game will not always tell you the quest is on hold, or not, or if it was even finished. As Well, this game lingers on a little longer in the time department in my case, I have played this game twice, and it takes a long time to finish this game just in one playthrough trying to do everything.   Gameplay is slightly stale from the isometric perspective of the game, and third person is slightly worse. Gameplay at times will either be frustrating do to the timing mechanism, and the constant enemies who will constantly appear in the same places you may have visited before will lose any thrill you might have of the combat system very soon.  Do I recommend playing this game? yes I do, as much of the frustration, and wrath I get in this game comes from being a result oriented player, being impatient with the time needed to do every quest. That is me, and my opinion, I will state on my first play it great, second not so much. One thing also hinders newer players from playing this game, none of the actions you do in this game translate over to the second game. Except are extremely left light in their reference of what really happened. Also as a warning this was made by Konami when they were still decent.",

In this game they tell us the story of man named Geralt that has lost his memories, but this man is not just human, he is a witcher, a human who has been modified to kill monsters. His friends tell him that he died years ago in a massacre. Now this man, ignorant from his past, is trying to track down an organization that stole the secrets from the witchers in their ambition to create something else.  The CONS I found in the game are:  -THE COMBAT SYSTEM BORES YOU: The only thing you have to do to fight is give some clicks to the enemy  you want to kill and its all, also yo have some spells, called signs, that are useful, but their not the fun part of the game,  I think that the fun part of fighting enemies is some kind of cinematic that Geralt does, his movements of swordfighting  and seeing 10 drowners die with 3 movements of the gropus style (the game have 3 styles of fighting: Strong, Fast and  Group). -THE STORY IS SOME KIND LAZY: If you first play The Witcher 3, The Witcher 2 or you have read the novels, you found  that in all The Witcher universe this is the laziest part of all. The story have 3 paths (The Knights of the Order, The  Scoia'tel, and neutral) you can chose your path with the desicions you make, but even when you take a path you don't  really feel like it was the path you choose, there's not much difference between the 3 options, only if you're REALLY into  the story. And even if you are into the story, you still find it lazy, because it doesn't have an impactful story at all. -MANY LOADING SCREENS: There's not to many at all, especially with a regular PC, but still anoying when you're going to  one part of the city to another and you have to wait to load. -IT CRASH SOMETIMES: Not too often, but it still crash, the only times when this happens (at least to me) is in the loading   screens, and it have enough loading screens to make it annoying. The PROS I found: -IT HAVE GOOD CHARACTERS: Their based on the novels, and the charactes (in ther majority) are loyal to the author's  perspective. -THE UNIVERSE IS GRIPPING: The monsters, the civil wars, the medieval aspect, the witchers, the fight for power,  everything is good and exciting even when it looks covered in ♥♥♥♥. -IT HAVE MANY GAMEPLAY HOURS: This can be good as bad, but for me is good, even with the annoying combat system,   it have like 40 or more hours of gameplay with many content that is not a copy/paste. -THE MORAL DECISIONS: Even when I say that the story it's no the strong point of this game I was talking about the main  story, but the secondary stories like side quest or the parts of the main quest that doesen't involve with the main  problem are pretty good. -ITS A GOOD WAY TO OPEN THE WITCHER VIDEOGAME SERIES: It's not to heavy and not light enough to introduce you to   universe of Geralt of Rivia. CONCLUSION: I recommend this game because even with its bad points, it makes you have a good time brewing potions, killing monsters and taking decisions that defines you as a witcher in a world where power is everything. It have it's fun parts with everyone being everyone, keeping loyal to the characters. I recommend to read the books first to have fun with the references, but I believe that when you finish this game, you'll want to read the books.",

            "review_text": "I wanted to like this game, I really did. But in the end the experience was more frustrating than enjoyable. There are plenty of reviews talking about the setting and what's great, and there are good things in this game, but here are the things that kept bugging me.  - The environments are huge, but for no reason. There is almost nothing to explore. And because everything is always at opposite ends of the map, you end up running back and forth all the time, fighting lots and lots of irritating low-level enemies on the way. - The fighting system seems interesting but ultimately provides little depth. It's way too clumsy to just be enjoyable in an action-rpg sense, and too inconsequential to be interesting to master. Bombs are completely unnecessary, you can upgrade weapons, but you end up getting much better weapons from quests, and magic has very little use except for two spells, and so on... - Fights are either stupidly hard or incredibly easy. You either kill the foes easily or you're cornered by a group that spams you with stunning/blinding/something attacks that leave you motionless for several seconds.  - Characters always end conversations before you're fully done. Rather than allowing you to consistently explore all conversation options and then quit, they end it for you and walk away. That means you may miss an important conversation option and aimlessly wander about looking for the next trigger to continue a quest. - Some conversation options only appear once. For example, I tried to play dice with one of the characters. But when I got to the option I wanted to first save the game, so selected 'not now', quit the conversation and saved. But after declining once, I never had another chance to start a conversation with the character again, and couldn't finish the quest as a result. - Conversations are sometimes random. A character may offer you a product or service in exchange for something else. If you don't happen have what they want on you, you're out of luck since this character may never make you the same offer again. I understand this is more realistic, but this simply doesn't work in a game. - Conversations are out of order. Things you can't possibly know yet turn up in conversation. It's confusing. - the map marker sometimes isn't helpful at all. For example, you may need to talk to someone, and the map marker will point the character's house. But the NPC will wander about the city rather than be at home, and they're sometimes impossible to find. That would be ok if it was to make things more realistic, and if you could maybe ask other NPC's where you can find the character. But at the same time, the map marker will always show up whether you've explored that part of the map or not. So if you're supposed to get something out of a grave, you'll know exactly where it is whether you've been there before or not. So the argument that it's for realism doesn't really apply. - The whole sex-card thing is just plain weird. I don't have an issue with sex in games, but the over-abundance of naked female foes and making sex a collectable ... seriously? It's a strange contrast to the otherwise mature themes of the game.  Anyway, I did finish the game, and there were fun parts. Particularly the last act picked up considerably, mostly because the maps were a bit tighter and there was less back and forth. But in the end I don't think it's nearly as good as people were making it out to be. It's ambitious, but ultimately flawed. ",

I was very surprised at how poorly this game actually functions considering the rave reviews from it's release and up to this very day.  From a graphical standpoint this game is dated-- but that's ok. Most of the games I play are indie titles anyway and few of them are graphical wonders-- I knew this going in and that isn't the issue. Somehow this game was billed as 'a great story, compelling gameplay, and dynamic immersion' into the Witcher universe. After about 30 minutes I thought I had descended to gamer hell. The mechanics in this game are not just poor, they are absolutely freaking terrible. Everything from the combat system to the magic, to the movement, to the healing, to the interaction with the environment is so terrible that I sincerely wonder how anyone every gave this company money to publish their title.   As for the story, EVERYTHING you do in this game breaks up the immersion of the story. Constant cutscenes, menu changes, loading screens-- pauses in combat to do what....????

After thinkin about it a good bit, and while the game has many positive qualities, I think they are not enough to outweigh the negatives.   The story is strong/mostly engaing and you can spend hours talking to folks, flicking through the glossary, and replaying to see how different choices impact outcomes. Graphics are okay, music is good to great. The game is LONG and chock full of sidequests.  The major drawbacks are the constant running back and forth to complete objectives (fast travel would be nice). Certain parts of the game, specifically act 2, feel like work. It picks up later on though you may find yourself using the save/load feature after every enemy later on in the game if you haven't prepared.

            "review_text": "This game has interesting ideas that built the fundemental models the Witcher sequels use, however it ultimately falls short as a standalone title. The story is the main drive of the game yet it can become very uninteresting very quickly unless you pay attention to every little detail and constantly check your journal for background information on characters and quests. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it ends up making you lose motivation to continue if you don't absolutely pay attention to what each character interaction entails. Completing quests, on the other hand, essentially boils down to you running from one end of the mostly boring enviroments to the other with the occasional sprinkles of combat in between. Even when the game introduces detective elements to the quests, they still feel like a chore and yield no substantial outcomes or rewards for your efforts; most of the time, they lead you to track a second or third person.  As for the combat, it feels very bland. The only thing making it different from a point-and-click mini-game is the alchemical preparations that can be carried out before each battle. But even that is something most people will choose to avoid since it is largely unnecessary at lower difficulty levels. My biggest complaint of all, however, is that at no point in the game do you feel like you have made significant progress as a player or as the character. There is no skill for you to master as a player as there is in other RPGs such as Dark Souls. And after 16 hours into this game, I also feel as though Geralt was the same as he was during his first fight (albeit with a few more spells).   Apart from the initial sparks of interest in the story, this game offered little of its own to compel me to continue my adventure. So, unless your intention is to learn how the Witcher games evolved as a series, you will be just fine skipping this title and reading up the story online to play the sequels.",

If I want to see hot women, the Internet has much more to offer, for less orens.  2. Great atmosphere. The graphics and audio, even for an older game, do a fantastic job of immersing you into the world, but this is not uncommon.  3. The game is inspired by novels. There is a huge appeal to seeing a world that you've read about brought to life in a video game. I did not read the Witcher books, despite having read a lot of fantasy books.  I've been playing games since Pong was released. We live in a time where the entertainment market is overflowing. I probably have around 10 highly rated games in my library that I haven't touched yet, and I have limited time to play them. The dialogue in The Witcher ranges from poor to interesting. The combat system is an ineffective blend of simplicity and timing. The plot consists of going from here to there, to here, to there, and back again.... several times.   Is this a bad game? No. By today's standards it's average, but average doesn't cut it when there are hundreds of products which stand out. If I had reviewed this game ten years ago, I would be impressed, but the very positive rating it has earned is no longer accurate today. Perhaps the newer games in the series are better.

            "review_text": "Horrible game with lots of unfulfilled promise.   This is a bad game with bad design and worse mechanics.   My #1 complaint with this game is how it promises a certain style of play, and then completely fails to live up to that promise. What am I talking about? Specifically, how the game promises that 'Witchers fight enemies on their terms,' but then every major fight in the game is a total surprise after a cut-scene, so you, the player, have no time to consume potions and 'prepare' for the battle like a proper Witcher.   Witchers are supposed to 'prepare' for fights; they're all about potions and prep, right? Well, not once you actually start playing the game. Forget that. Instead, you're stuck with long, dailog-heavy cut-scenes that you can't click-through, and then you're thrust into battle with enemies standing immediately next to you, getting free shots at you before you can even draw your sword. Where's the preparation aspect? What use are potions if you can only manage to drink a single one while your enemies beat on you at the start of a fight and knock your health down? It's a catch-22 at that point: do I risk drinking a potion and getting my health knocked down, or do I try and fight with no potions and die that way instead? Either way, you're going to get your butt handed to you, so then you'll have to reload a save, which will be BEFORE the long cut-scene, so now you're going to have to sit through the dialog AGAIN. Rinse, repeat... ugh. Not worth it.   And potions... don't get me started. What should have been a very awesome aspect to this game is totally butchered in its execution.   The Witcher's inventory is VERY limited, and potions are pretty much a rare commodity to be hoarded and used only at the proper moment before battle. But there's a myriad of problems with that idea, and the way the designers implemented this game, it just doesn't work.   For starters, the potions don't tell you how long they last, so you have no idea when you start playing if a potion lasts 8 hours or 20 minutes. Knowing this information would go a long way toward deciding WHEN to consume a potion. Once you use a potion and see how long it lasts, YOU, the player, are forced to remember this information as you play, instead of it being a part of the metadata that is should be easily accessible in the potions section of the journal (thanks, but I think my character should know that information, not me). The Witcher is billed as a monster-hunter who relies heavily on his knowledge of his enemies to fight them in situations that are advantageous to the Witcher. You would think, then, that the Witcher would know the duration of his own potions.   Second, unless you're clairvoyant, or have already played through the game in its entirety, you have no idea exactly when is a good time to consume a potion. And if a potion lasts, say, 20 minutes, odds are you're going to waste a huge chunk of that time in stupid cut-scenes...  On top of all of this, the fighting mechanics are just clunky and unresponsive. This is, quite literally, the clunkiest fighting style I've ever seen in a video game. It's aggravating. It's like a cross between Neverwinter Nights and whack-a-mole. It would have been better if the designers would have just opted for a point-and-click-autoattack approach like NWN or some other DnD game. Instead, they want you to 'chain' attacks together but clicking 'only when they want you to click', but when a half-dozen bad guys are beating on your butt after a cut-scene, that sort of thing just doesn't work. Players reflexes and instincts are basically way too fast for this slow interface and sluggish fighting style. Either autoattack and let the player choose targets, or let the player really control Geralt and fight the enemies.   And the cut-scenes. My gosh, the cut-scenes. So. Many. Cut. Scenes. You can't even take a short trip through the sewer to kill a dumb bird without fifty cut-scenes completely killing your momentum. It's beyond aggravating.   I really, really wanted to like this game when it came out years ago, but I couldn't suffer it beyond Vizima. Years later I tried again, downloading off Steam, and I can't even make it out of the Detective's house. This game is insufferable. I'm sure there's a good idea in here, but the execution is just terrible.   Plain and simple: playing this game is no fun.   ",

The dialogue and most of the voice acting to go with it is pretty awful, especially as the game progresses. Which doesn't help the mostly bland, uninteresting characters. Geralt, Triss and Shani are the only characters with actual personality, erratic as the latter two are in that. Almost universally the environments are drab, boring, and uninteresting with little to go exploring for. Sidequests are plentiful, but most require partaking in the subpar combat more than I could personally endure; and for usually meaningless rewards.  Then there is the overall story, which starts out dull, gets slightly interesting during acts 2 and 3, turns into FillerFest '07 during acts 4 and 5, then finally comes to an end in the Epilogue chapter to a pretty unfulfilling end with a completely out of left field plot twist.

I got throught the first Dragon Age, bugs and all, with a smile on my fact. The combat in this is what will simply keep me away from it. I tried for half an hour. I genuinely tried, but the repition is just too much. Sorry fanboys.

The characters swing at each other and the sword goes through the combatants bodies as if they were holograms. I know someone will probably get all over my ♥♥♥ about how it's either based on a dice roll or how I'm ignorant and don't appreciate what the game is trying to convey. Well either way, I don't give a sh*t about any of that if the combat in what I thought was an action RPG isn't very action-y. I mentioned earlier the story is great. But that's all this game is. Cutscenes are long drawn out dramatic affairs brimming with exposition and long conversations and just when you think you've been given control, you activate another cut scene. Look, if I wanted to watch a movie, I would do that. And I wouldn't have to sit here with a mouse and keyboard while I watched it. If you like long cut scenes and are more interested in watching a CG movie then killing bad guys, solving puzzles, exploring a world, or just playing around, then there is something here to enjoy.

The sword fighting consists of you running up to an enemy, clicking once to initiate a ridiculous looking sword swinging animation, and clicking again when some tiny icon blinks in order to continue your silly animation. It's essentially an old form of quicktime event in order to continue fighting. The game is overly complex with a ton of icons cluttering the border of the gamescreen, most of which you'll forget only 2 minutes after being told what they are. The inventory is an absolute mess and I was afraid to open it after the first time I was tasked with drinking a potion. The game constantly forces you into terrible cutscenes that just force you to stand there awkwardly spewing out dialogue to a fellow companion. They could have easily allowed you to play whilst the dialogue is going on, but instead they force you to stand there with no option to skip. The graphics are very dated, which is to be expected considering this is a very old game. There are no redeeming qualities to this game except perhaps story, but I personally wouldn't know.

Then you reach the second half of Chapter II, you realize the majority of the sidequests are pointless and not worth doing, most of the potions aren't worth using even on the harder difficulty, the combat is just clicking and it will never be more than that, the story is taking ages to progress and most of the dialogue just isn't interesting.

If video games were to be evaluated in a similar manner to that of a writing assignment, The Witcher would go straight in the 'fail' pile like a paper whose handwriting is so illegible that deigning to read it would be a fool's errand. While the loading screens offer promise of lush, detailed and open environments, the game itself launches with a 10-odd-minute cutscene establishing the character, Geralt of Riviera. What this sequence conveys is rather simple: CD Projekt Red created the coolest character to star in a video game ever (if you're 12), and they want to spend the amount of time in your life it would take to cook and serve a meal to yourself before any gameplay starts expressing as much.   The optimization is so ♥♥♥♥-poor that if you aren't the kind of person who makes an entire hobby out of building computers that play video games rather than just playing video games yourself, you'll be met with a message upon trying to launch the game that system requirements are not met. (Before any confusion, I'll take time to note here that my system runs Dark Souls in 720p with nary a hitch.) Waiting for the launcher to execute after reading this message is another fool's errand; it will not, until a line of code bypassing this check is added in the properties of a shortcut to the executable. What a load of ♥♥♥♥.   Interpreting this message as that of a game with some real muscle behind it, I am side-swiped by a notion of profound disappointment--let's call it 'what the ♥♥♥♥ is this'-ness--when I arrive in-game to find myself in a world of N64-grade textures, populated by PS2-grade character models (one of whom, amid a scraggly lot of dreary-looking Tolkien caricatures, more closely resembles a Maxim pin-up with more body mass in her ♥♥♥♥ than in all the rest of her put together), whose uncanny animations jerk and stutter at an unstable framerate. Recoiling in horror from this mannequin-acted softcore porno-opera perverted from the base stipulations for a high fantasy backdrop (there's swords and wizards and ♥♥♥♥), I can scarcely take a step backwards before the game wrests control to turn me back around like a child being led from the grown-ups table.   Combat comes in a choice of two formats: overhead point-and-click Diablo style, or over-the-shoulder with WASD controls. I suppose there is also the option to play overhead with the WASD controls, but it's rather awful and seems provided as an afterthought. The meat of the aforementioned combat is comprised of running up to a bad guy after having drawn your sword and mash-clicking your left mouse button, performing skillful fencing maneuvers in-game and Tourettes-spazzing on your mouse in real life while your enemy stands and behaves just as he did before you got there. This may be a result of the game failing to behave as it should. After all, I am playing on a laptop, and it is terribly, terribly optimized.   Attempting this sequence twice was all I could stomach before returning to Steam and requesting refund for my $1.50 purchase. I could buy a Coke with that. Twelve ounces of Coca-Cola is a better purchase than this game.",

The combat i felt was pretty unsatisfying either, all it requires is you click the left mouse button in sync with the flame icon that pops up for you to continue the combo, and you will often have to change between 3 stances, one stance that is for big slow opponents, one that is for smaller quicker opponents and one that is for when you are surrounded by a group. There is also magic spells you can use but they just feel tacked on and not special.  The problem is that the game is boring, i managed to get through the extremely slow beginning but even after that the game doesnt do enough to keep you interested. Ive read a lot of people who say that despite the slow start the game opens up after chapter 3, but thats the problem, i shouldnt have to put in 20 hours before a games story begins to open up, its just not fun. There are way too many fetch quests that require you to run from one side of the map to other at least 5 times talking to NPC's that by the end it you will be to exhausted to care. I am roughly 10 hours in and the game has felt like a chore and i think its time i pull the pin, i am just not pulled into the world or the character.   I thought i could power through the game for the story but its just not fun or exciting enough for me to do so, if you like doing fetch quests, backtracking and heaps of dialogue then maybe this game is for you. I would personally think its better to not waste your time and jump straight into the Witcher 2, from what i have read not playing the first game doesnt really impact on what happens in the 2nd game.  Hope my review has been helpful.",

Well, I've played it, but I can't seem to get myself to finish it.  The first problem I encountered was with the boss monster at the end of Chapter One. Up until this point, the game had taught me that - as a monster hunter - monsters needed to be studied before you killed them. You had to buy a book, read about the monster in question, and prepare necessary potions or oils (monster poison). I felt like an authentic monster hunter.  Then the first boss fight happened.  The books I had read on it said that I'd have to answer a riddle before fighting it. That it would be vulnerable if I answered correctly. I had time to prepare before beginning my assault on the forces who were behind its summoning. Then I was interrupted rather abruptly by some cut-scene dialogue where I was faced with some pretty boring black/white morality decisions. And then the boss appeared and stunned me and hit me until I died. Total fight time: roughly 15 seconds. So, I loaded my previous save, before the dialogue, and tried again. I lasted 20 seconds this time, though again, most of it was spent stunned.  At this point I checked the internet for some advice. All of the advice consisted of exploiting a terrain feature and using a certain weapon oil to kill it from safety. So I tried again. This time, I made some oils, coated my weapon, drank a couple of buff potions, and then proceeded with the dialogue. When the fight started, all of my potion effects were removed. So I died again. Load, die, load, die, load, die. Eventually I beat the boss by waiting until the fight started and then applying my oil and drinking my potions. Though this resulted in my death the first few attempts (the animations are painfully elaborate.)  This is not what the game had trained me to do. There was no preparation necessary. There was no riddle. There was no warning at all. Completely ruined the immersion for me.  Chapter two was full of women offerring to have sex with the protagonist in exchange for laughably easy item drops or mini-quests. Some investigation into the wiki revealed that there were no romance options for these encounters, and no effect on either of the two main romance options. At one point, an anatomically-correct and completely nude dryad offers to have sex with me in exchange for a single wolf pelt, which wolves have a 100% chance of dropping. There were wolves not 5 seconds away from the dryad.  As a male gamer who is no longer 13 years old, I was pretty disappointed by this behavior. The game is laughable, the plot predictable, the mechanics repetitive, and the mysogyny made me feel incredibly uncomfortable.",

            "review_text": "Sorry if this review might look less extensive compared to my others. I simply couldnt get myself to make a extensive one since I cant do much with the game honestly.  I dont get it what people like about the first The Witcher game. Its simply boring.  The Story and the character interactions are alright but also stupid in some cases. I dont further extend on the story. I honestly dont know it completely anyway.  So rather look up another place to get a view of it. The character interactions mostly seem to be for people who need to fu** every damn women they meet. The art and level design + soundtrack is well done and leaves not much to desire for me. The animations are awful though. I talk about animations like fighting or general human interaction. Graphics are mediocre. It misses a Vsync option for some reason. Not that much of a deal, use the driver for it. It should also be noted that there are many proper developed and implemented languages. I tried English and German and both really sounded well done to me.  But the worst is the gameplay... its just so bad. I dont know... Rarely played something worse. The camera and the general fighting response is just so bad. It reminds me of pre 2000 games. No offense but seriously. The OSD camera is still the best but far from being good. The other stuff like UI is also just mediocre bestly. Sometimes questionable at times. At least the whole game is properly explained in the tutorial. But the general UI feels overloaded which is funny because the game is actually playable only with a damn mouse. Click Click Click. Thats how to fight. Nothing more to it actually... Unless you want to bother with dodging which feels like Gerald is using a magic carpet to move. I dont get it how the devs could fu** up the gameplay so much. They didnt seem to care much about it in the first part. Sorry but graphics, level design, story, interaction, soundtrack is not all. Yes, all those parts are well done but thats it. Looking at ANY other aspects just makes me choke... And gameplay is the key element for me, even if I try to ignore it. It just doesnt go with me. I would rather play Skyrim tons of times (with mods) even if the Witcher might beat it Story wisely. I literally dont care about this part since I want a proper gameplay experience and The Witcher (1) isnt able to deliver this, no matter how good the story is.  Positive: - Good Story - Interesting Characters - Many good language options - Soundtrack  Neutral: - Graphics  Negative: - Gameplay - Animations - Controls - Annoying as hell 'Companions...' They die all few seconds and you cant do much. - Odd character reactions when talking with each other (Insulting them without even knowing why and they stop talking with you)  Rating: 5/10  Only if you really need to play it, for example if you want the full story experience of The Witcher games. For me gameplay is the main and most important element for a game. Some might say Story. The story is well done. The gameplay is for my taste uterly horrible... So at the end you have a game which strikes with its story, design and soundtrack but miserably fails in its core gameplay.",

It's overly complex and clunky &amp; hard to figure out while there is a lot of content which would be a good thing it is buggy couldn't complete some missions because there is only one inventory slot for trophys and I got attacked by the wolf &amp; wyvern at the same time but lost the wolf head somewhere in the swamp and couldn't find it later to claim the prize. Sometimes quest items aren't reserved so you can accidentally use them up in potion brewing again leaving you unable to complete quests and get the all important gold. in spite of this I was about to say it's just about do-able but at about level 3 the game kept crashing in the salamandra hideout at about the time where more gfx are slowly introduced eg. an animated sheild and runes on the sword blades at that point the game kept crashing at the most inconvenient point in the thick of some of the more difficult intense clashes so it became a pia to keep reloading it I turned down the settings a bit but couldn't figure out wtf was the problem so I'm skipping the rest of it to try witcher 2 as I got them both for dirt in a sale might come back to it later but it's hard to recommend.

There was literally a cutscene every 5 minutes that had pointless dialouge or petty bickering between the characters.  - The worst combat system I have ever seen in a game. You have to switch between combat styles depending an enemy's size/speed? That's just ridiculous. And if you have the 'wrong' combat style for an enemy it won't do any damage, even if you're clearly hitting your opponent.  - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorials. They don't explain a lot of what you're supposed to be doing, or what buttons to push to do an action. - Jargon. When some of the excessive amounts of cutscenes were going on, the characters used A LOT, and I mean A LOT of words that me, as a first time player, had no idea what 90% of it meant. Think if you were talking to a lawyer about their job and they broke out all of the big law words that they use in the court room. You'd have no idea what they were talking about, and the same applies for this game's dialouge.  - NOT ENJOYABLE. The entire 40-45 minutes that I played of this were horrible. I was confused, I was angry, and I had no idea what was going on for a large majority of it. Games are supposed to be enjoyable and fun to play, and this isn't.
