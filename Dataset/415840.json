            "review_text": "The Steam Community will like this 'free to play' Hidden Object game far better then the last one (Lost Lands: A Hidden Object Adventure), for one, the achievements are far easier to get and are in sync with the area leveling. Achievements are earned at the first level up. Though I am sure many will still complain about microtransactions that NEVER, EVER have to be done.   The player levels up relatively fast giving the player a full energy bar to continue playing. There are 38 locations in total to open. There are also two nice features at the bottom of the page, a diary and main story quest log, so the player can keep track of the storyline.  The Hidden Object scenes start out with 3 items and the items increase at each level. Also the player is encouraged to chain the object finds to increase the 'prizes' of XP, money, items, and energy. A special area feature is the little picture by each area name indicting the type of HO scene available. 'Sun' is straight find list. 'Hand and sun' Silhouette mode. 'Moon and stars' Night mode. This makes it much easier to know, find and anticipate certain modes when needed for quests.  Much easier play style compared to other games of this type, with far less grinding then usual and who can beat the price of FREE, so give it a try if so inclined.",
