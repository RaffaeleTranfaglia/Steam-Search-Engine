            "review_text": "A charming cluster♥♥♥♥ of a trainwreck Visual Novel game.  Frustrating dialogue.  A UI that has aged poorly since its PSX days.  Gameplay segments with no gameplay and zero choice that trick you into thinking you have agency and serve no purpose.  A nonsense story that seems to be missing a few chapters with characters that don't seem to operate on human logic.  A NON-ENDING.  And I loved it. I loved every bit of this lovingly crafted mess, because it oozes love and quality from the staff that created it, and I am a huge fan of massive, poorly crafted, ambiguous stories that make you fill in the blanks.  This is a gem of the PSX era of VNs and is a testament to the fact that you don't need to make a good game, or even a good STORY to make something that's utterly enjoyable, because presentation and love trumps all.  People who weren't teens or young adults during the PSX era might not really get it. But I sure as hell do.",

But this Criminal Fiction was crafted in its pure form to make sure you understand all the character mind, making this visual novel real hard to just play, but your experience may vary.",

            "review_text": "  The Silver Case: ~~~~~~~~~~~~   Kamui Uehara, a cold-blooded serial killer escaped the mental institute where he was kept. Several people were killed, including members of the Special Forces. But somethings doesn’t add up! You are now part of the team researching this event . . . . What are you going to discover. . . This is part of the Silver Case!  The Silver Case is a visual novel game. In this game, you will follow the steps of an officer of the Heinous Crime unit (in my case, Froggy) on several cases. You also get to play a freelancer reporter, Tokio Morishima.  As you start the story, Kusabi (the man who arrested Kamui the first time around) was on his way home when he felt suddenly unsettled. Who can blame him when he saw this individual staring at him in the middle of the road with a human head on one of his hands! After shooting at Kusabi, the stranger ran into the cauliflower tower. From here, your character becomes part of the story.  Being a visual novel, there is plenty of reading in The Silver Case. As you progress through the game, you will gain a good understanding of the main characters and how they react to situations.   I like a good novel (book) and part of the experience is to imagine the scenes of what you are actually reading. Here, in the Silver Case, you will actually see the scenes; there are cut-scenes (animations or video footage) and in some parts of the game you will be able to explore the environment as you investigate or report cases. You will also interact with characters and objects. As a newcomer to this genre of game, I really appreciated the combination of all the above - I truly felt that I was involved in the story.   In terms of the dialogues, overall they are good. I must admit that on occasion some of the text was a bit awkward, but that is my take on the read. I really like the soundtrack; it fits the cases/scenes very well.  Positives: ~~~~~~~   - Entertaining cases and story - Great soundtrack - Reading, exploring and cut-scenes combination is well done - Achievements  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - No trading cards  7/10  The Silver Case integrates reading, cut-scenes and exploration. Whether you are familiar with visual novels, or new to this genre of game, give The Silver Case a read!  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

A blast from the past this story-driven tale pulls no punches in dialogue. It's also a first early introduction to bizarre yet interesting art that Suda has put in his games. I honestly hope the success of this release can give us releases of his other games that his western fanbase is seeking for with FS&amp;R and a hopeful Killer 7 re-release as well.  (Honestly though I could want to see a release of 'Michigan'.)",
