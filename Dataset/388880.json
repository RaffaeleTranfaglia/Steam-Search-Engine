            "review_text": "I love this game. Like, I  really  love this game.  The dialogue is organic and the voice acting is excellent - nothing the characters say feels forced or shoehorned in. As for the characters themselves they are well rounded, likable and don’t fall into any of the typical teenager stereotypes - and it’s refreshing, to say the  very  least.  The atmosphere is consistently creepy and oppressive, even during the lighter, more comedic moments - and the soundtrack and visual aesthetic add to it. And when you find yourself alone, you  really  feel alone. It’s hard to properly describe, but you’ll know what I mean the first time you get separated from your friends.  My only complaint is that sometimes your companions will occasionally get stuck either on corners or in the middle of a stairwell, but it’s fixed on transitioning to a new area.  I cannot recommend  Oxenfree  more. This game is fascinating, terrifying and excellently written. If you are on the fence about buying it, I urge you. It’s well worth the price tag. ",

            "review_text": "Overall, just a genuinely great game. Of course there were some things that could've been improved, but the characters were amazing, mainly in the sense that for once a game has actual realistic teenagers that aren't walking clichés.  The only really issues I had were that there was no way to see what the controls were, although this was only really an issue at the very start, but still I feel like it would've come in handy, and secondly, movement was a bit dodgy, both in the sense of the speed being very slow and also its a bit awkward when turning corners, although I eventually got over both of those problems.  The story was really good and I enjoyed the fact that there are multiple different endings and all that, although I wish you could see there was a way to rewind like in other choice based games instead of having to start over again.  Overall I'd probably give the game a 9/10 due to it being a really good game, definitely would recommend it. Great start to gaming in 2016.",

            "review_text": "  Oxenfree is a relatively short game that follows the story of a group of friends that find themselves stuck on a mysterious island. You play as Alex, a turquoise haired girl, and her personality is pretty much in your hands. In fact, one of my personal favourite game features, is the possibility to choose from different dialogue options whenever the characters interact with eachother, giving you the chance to alter the final development of the story. This means the game has different endings. Specifically, it provides interchangable facts that eventually mix up with eachother, offering the chance of having a wide amount of combinations for each ending. Basically you could play even 4 times and each time get a different set of combinations.  The style of the game is not too complex but its semplicity makes it cute and enjoyable. The mix between 2D and a slight 3D touch (especially for the characters) is pretty remarkable and gives the whole environment an interesting and good look. The soundtrack might become slightly repetitive at times but it generally flows pretty well in the background and fits quite nicely. I was happily surprised by how good the thriller element is portrayed. The pastel colours and the general cute graphics wouldn't let you think the game could get pretty spooky. I personally had one of the worst jumpscares I've ever experienced in videogames while playing this title. The scary effects are not too elaborated but they are astonishingly well made and when they mix up with the creepy sounds and visual elements they can sure send some chills down your spine. So don't get fooled by the innocent art style, because the thriller part of the story is very well taken care of, too.  Probably the only criticism I can make is that sometimes moving from a location to another can be quite a slow process.   The story can be finished in about 5 hours. If you, like I am, are the kind of player that gets a stroke if they don't get all the collectables in the game, then backtracking and looking for all the itmes will take you some time.  This game is really a little spooky adventure that will keep you entertained and looking for answers. Bonus points for the replay value considering the mutliple endings. A nice lil' ghost story to gift yourself.",

            "review_text": "Whoa. Okay.  So even from last year when the game was announced, I was already hyped for it. And I'm happy to say that the final product did not disappoint. This game has such a unique and beautiful art style that I've never seen before, coupled with a minimalistic interface and absolutely SUPERB writing and voice acting. I loved the seamless flow of dialogue between the characters, I was very intrigued by the story and the horror elements. The ending to me at first felt a little...abrupt, but I was left quite thrilled at the plot twist which, even though I saw coming, was still pretty darn cool.  My only gripes were that there were still a few glitches in the game I noticed, where the characters that accompanied me got stuck in some places, which was slightly immersion-breaking. But it's totally understandable since the game literally just dropped. Another little nitpick is I wish there was a fast-travel system for the island, especially in the later stages. Since I'm a completionist, I wanted to explore and find the collectibles, but it was a bit tedious having to manually go everywhere. A fast travel system from point to point would have been handy.  If you're a fan of story-driven, choice-based games like TellTale games or Life is Strange, then this game is without question meant for you. I really enjoyed it and will probably play through it several more times, just to see the different outcomes. And honestly, the story makes it make SENSE to play through the game more than once. If you've finished it, you'll understand why.    UPDATE (June 2, 2016):   There's now a New Game + mode available for this game, and I just finished it. Personally I found it to be a bit underwhelming, since the description promised a lot more than what the game gave, I thought. It had a very interesting new ending, and several new additions that kept me somewhat engaged, but for the most part there really wasn't THAT much added. If you're like me and have previously played at least 5-6 playthroughs of the game already, you'd spend most of it trying to seek out as much new content as possible, and I guess I was disappointed that there wasn't enough of it in my opinion. I was expecting some sort of big expansion or a ton more new dialogue options/scenarios. Still, it was something new.",

            "review_text": "This game was a little slow to get in to because the characters weren't immediately or particularly relatable (to me), but I found myself warming to it over the course of the game as the story unfolded and the plot developed.  The conversation system in this game is quite unique and is one of the game's main strengths. It takes some getting used to because it's unusual: the dialogue options don't wait for you to make a choice. But again I found myself warming to this mechanic because it actually lets you choose to say nothing at all in most situations. A simple concept but quite profound and rare in games where you're usually forced to make a choice even if you don't like any of the options presented. Here you can choose not to respond. A brilliant concept and the developers should be commended for the idea and implementing it well.  What I particularly like is the way the game encourages multiple play-throughs. It's not obvious how to achieve the different endings and outcomes in this game, that is something you have to discover. There's some great ingenuity and game design here and it's underscored by beautiful painterly artwork, an exceptional soundtrack and well-recorded voice acting. The voice acting does feel a little too 'professional' but it's probably better to err that way than the reverse (unprofessional).  There are a few minor annoyances. I experienced a few occasions when dialogue options went off the edge of the screen so you couldn't read them. But overall the game played well, albeit a little slowly. If you don't have patience for narritive-driven games it mightn't be for you but I was impressed by just how much dialogue there is.  I hope this developer can make another game. I quite enjoyed it and I'm definitely interested in any other game they decide to make.",

            "review_text": "Oxenfree. I never heard of this game until a few days ago thanks to a Let's Player named Bowlingotter who played 2 hours on a live stream. After seeing that, I began to debate getting it for the $19.99 full price, but something about it drew me to it.   I can say it is money well spent.   What is this game? It's sort of a point and click adventure, with mysteries and spookiness abounding. You play as Alex, a young teenage woman going to an island with some friends, and your new step-brother. As the game progresses you find out the darker secrets of the island, but you also build relationships with your friends, and depending on how you play and how you treat them will determine different things later on, including the various endings you can receive.   How is the gameplay? It's very good. There's a mechanic involving a radio and finding hidden radio stations that is good for those who like to know more about the mystery and also like collectables + achievements. It's all very simple and works very well.  I also would like to praise the voice acting in this game. I was instantly reminded of Life is Strange, another favorite, with the dialogue and level of voice acting here. Everyone does a great job, and there's a LOT of talking, but I never was bored or thought the dialouge was corny; In fact, I wanted more of it. Major kudos to the studio and actors for pulling this off - it could have gone the other way, and never did.  The game also presents the player with various choices much like Telltale games, Until Dawn, or, again, Life is Strange. You get three choices, normally, and this will lead to various responses depending on what you said, and this also allows for a lot of replayability.  The game does, as the description says, revolve around ghosts and it is quite spooky and eerie in parts, specifically relating to the radio, but there's no gore or anything, just spooks and mystery.   I got all the collectables and had a wonderful time. I don't normally spring for a full priced game, especially one I just heard of and is a new IP, but if you're on the fence, I'd say give it a go. If you liked any of the other games I mentioned, I think you'll like this game. It took me about 8 hours, but it's 8 hours of really good and fun content, and some $60 games have that much content, but isn't as good or deep.   As I said, I didn't hear of this game til recently, but I'm so glad I did, and I will be replaying it for sure, not just for the achievements, but the experience, the interaction of characters (which I ended up liking!) and just enjoying the game as a whole, and you should too!",

Ren, esepcially. If he was intended to be extremely obnoxious, then they the writers at least succeeded on that point.  The main draw of the game is the dialog options you can choose for your character that hapes the story and eventual outcome. However, I found myself not choosing any dialog option a lot of the time as the game went on, because I was honestly hoping that it wouldn't lead to more talking. Take that away, and what you're left with is a mediocre ghost story at best. The gameplay was also quit boring. There's a 'puzzle' aspect of the game that involves tuning your radio to specific frequencies, but that was more tedious than illuminating.  I will say Oxenfree had some great art and music.",

But there's more to it than that it meets what should be the genre's basic expectations. The voice-acting, the writing, the art-style, the music and sound design are all nothing less than sublime. Its innovative dialogue system, which doesnt simply freeze time in the manner of LiS or Telltale games, makes for conversations that are uniquely fluid and naturalistic in video games.

Much of the gameplay consists of walking from one objective to the next, but the sci-fi elements, well-conceived atmosphere, and fresh dialogue keep these treks from being tedious. The presentation is highly stylized and superb, with the '80s VHS-style visual &amp; audio flourishes being the highlight. Clocking in at around 4 hours, the $20 retail cost may be a bit pricey, though this is certainly worth every penny on sale or in a bundle, especially as it has a New Game + mode which the game strongly encourages through new scenes &amp; dialogue, multiple endings, and differing choice-based consequences you miss in your first playthrough. This is one of the best indie games I've played this decade, and I highly recommend it to those who enjoy sci-fi and horror, decision-based gameplay, or simply engrossing storytelling.",

Overall, this is a charming and well-done game where, in just one playthrough, you realize all the little choices you make each minute. Choices in this game feel like they have weight, even if they may ultimately not. I found myself haunted by my words from the beginning when, really, all I had been trying to do is be friendly and try to help. And, it should be noted, that the option to stay silent is there and I am actually really interested in a totally silent playthrough.  Depending on your view of these games, this will either be a great adventure or a boring walk through a storybook. The game does its best some of the time to alleviate these issues, but shoots itself in the foot in others. So, let me get to the big things that could sway your opinion.  1. Character banter: Let's not beat about the bush, the characters in this game are verbose. You will walk a few steps and we will begin an epic four-part saga into the latest developments of the lot and/or your psyche. You will also frequently listen to the witty banter of the characters, perhaps including yourself. I can see this being a serious draw for some and a serious headache for others. I liked the banter (and actually thought the writing was really well done) but even I was getting a little tied of feeling like I wanted to let these characters talk but still wanting to vocalize my thoughts so we didn't just go off and have more brownies or go try to kill demon people. And there were more than a few times where I felt like I missed something with a character or with a location because I happened to trigger plot progression before one of those actually finished.  2. Map length/navigation: This game is filled with picture-book-style locations that are beautiful to look at and occasionally a nightmare to navigate. My first playthrough was sort of a stumble-on-things-as-you-go run, but I didn't feel that tempted to go seek out secrets/alternative paths mostly because the paths are frustratingly long and we're frustratingly slow. At some point, I think it's legitimate to suggest that the developers made more long, winding paths that I have to do a dance at every hairpin turn because they wanted the game to last longer. I would have spents at least an hour less on this game if there were straight/swooping curved paths instead of zig-zagging paths.  3. Choices: This is inevitable with these sorts of choice-based games where you have to select an option from a list, but choices frequently felt like they took on a life of their own. There's nothing to suggest that 'That's okay' is going to make me say 'That's okay' honestly, sarcastically, or say it honestly, then proceed to insult the person I'm talking to so as to make them think I was saying it sarcastically.",

Don't get me wrong- The first 20 minutes are cool, It sets up interesting characters, a great setting and the potential for a good story.   But before you know it- you'll be trudging around needlessly oversized area's, tuning your radio everytime you come up to anything of interest or any puzzle (because its the only game mechanic you have), and aching for this game to speed up.  A page on  escapistmagazine.com  states: '[Oxenfree] does feature choices that change the story that unfolds. Relationships become extremely meaningful and making friends, or enemies, will change the course of the game.' This could not be further from the truth! There are 6 different endings, and thats the only thing your choices will eventually effect, .. which little 2 minute ending you see...  The voice acting's really good tho, and there wasn't any of the usual cringy dialogue found in other games with teenagers - so credit to the voice team for holding this game above water.  I really wanted to like this game! but after a few hours of it; I wished I'd never bothered. People always complain about games being too short- but this game should have been condensed into a solid 2 hour experience. Instead- it drags for over 4 hours, that I can never get back.   If you want an emotional game about teenagers- play Gone Home or Life Is Strange -&gt; they are amazing.  This game is NOT a 'Beautiful haunting story that begs to be replayed' (-IGN) Its a slow-walk, radio-tuning simulator. Also, I have no idea why Oxenfree is being prased for how beautiful it apparently looks.  Its visually acceptable. But 'Beautiful'!?? really?..",

The premise is that you and a few friends are on an island enjoying time together and exploring. You stumble upon a cave and that is when things start getting crazy.   For me Oxenfree represents nice and simply, how to do a good story and how to fill a small world with interesting lore and locations. The gameplay is simple without anything being too demanding yet is entertaining in what it offers. Early on your are introduced to a game mechanic which is crucial throughout the game.   In terms of horror, I saw a review which said that this game was the love child of Life is Strange and Stranger Things. The latter part is most certainly true, it ramps up tension without doing anything like a jump scare. The introduction of parts of the story add interesting layers of tension and twists, for the sake of a spoiler free review I shall tease you with that a lone and not go into anymore detail.   Lastly and perhaps most memorable is that this game deals with some very deep ideas and themes. Ideas of death, the afterlife, time, parallel worlds and decisions are all discussed in great detail and the addition of choice matters is a very pleasant decision. The way you interact with your friends and the world around you creates relationships, closer friends, enemies, tensions, danger and many other things.   I shant go into anymore detail for this review as I would suggest buying this game. However buy it when it is on sale as great value for money when it is £4 or so.",

It is completely story based, amazing visuals, chilling soundtrack and voice acting is really well done for this, and choices DO matter in the end (bonus of receiving achievements). The characterization of this game is fantastic, the writers and the voice actors made it all too well believable.   Before getting to actually play this game I had to adjust my settings and lower the resolution because of how laggy the game was. Aside from that the controls to this game is simple and easy to follow, the only downside is not having to control when you run whenever you'd like. So often when having to walk a distance it feels more of a chore than an adventure because of how slow paced the characters are when walking. There are some areas where the pathing is really awkward but not too much of an issue.   If you're into Life Is Strange, this is definitely a game I highly recommend for you. Also gives me somewhat of a Corpse Party vibe to it. Strap yourself in for an emotional rollarcoaster. I'm not someone who's all too well for playing horror games, as much as this game freaked me out: I could not put it down. The story pulls you in with an incredible dialogue that flows naturally, and the atmosphere is stunning whilst beyond eery. It's filled with mystery, slice of life and horror. Radio frequencies have always been a creepy aspect of games and movies to me, the static sound and the inexpicable noises/voices that comes from within it. And the game focuses around that: tuning into a radio and adjusting the frequencies and running into eery audio bits from older films that loop (very often used for hints), finding a song, or hearing creepy voices. A lot of the game likes to play tricks with your mind. I would've taken my time to really look at everything, but I was honestly too creeped out by everything.  I can't say I'd probably play it again just because of the creepy aspect of it, but you never know. Overall, simply amazing.",

            "review_text": "Within the first 10~20 minutes of the game, I knew it was going to be good. Oxenfree is amazing and excels in pretty much every aspect, and the only issues I have with the game are all very minor. It is incredibly interesting, immersive, detailed, well-paced and beautifully crafted. Here's a breakdown of everything I thought of the game, both the positives and the negatives (the former of which greatly outweighs the latter):  Pros:  - Lovely art style and animations. All of the maps are beautifully made, some especially so, and the creepy 'glitch' aesthetic for a majority of the sequences are electrifying and do a perfect job of setting the right tone for the game. - Character design and voice acting. The entire cast is unique, but not in any extreme manner that makes them unrelatable or eccentric. Their voice acting is extremely believable, life-like and strike a very nice balance of just enough dialogue to make the experience engaging, informative, and oftentimes amusing, but not to the point where you feel the characters won't shut up. - Choices and responses. Most dialogues will give you the opportunity, usually several times during one exchange, to choose between 2-3 options for Alex (the MC) to say, giving you plenty of time to develop (or destroy) your relationships and make your decisions as you see fit. The game, despite growing gradually creepier and more dire as things go, never fails to drop in something humorous or the option for it at occasional intervals, and I'm very thankful for this. - Awesome storyline! There's truly a lot of work and thought put into it, and research as well. Every aspect of the game further enhances the storyline, mainly through the use of the radio and the various signals you can tap into, some of which can offer you additional information. It's realistic while also being dystopian at the same time, and every part of the game's world (both past and present, normal and supernatural) feels 'authentic'. - Various endings and ways to get them. While I've not yet gotten them all, I know there's a good few, and I look forward to finding them all. - A balance of pacing and challenge. The game does require you to be on your toes, pay attention and act fast or remember certain things, maybe go looking around for a bit, but it is unlikely that you'll be actually 'stuck' at any point. It also balances between cinematics / extended dialogues and wandering around to explore and accomplish objectives. I never felt like I was doing too much of one thing. - One of the best things about this game: soundtrack. The sound of the whole game entire is beautiful, from the ambience, special effects, songs, recordings, and everything else. It sets various different moods across the storyline and yet not one sounds out of place. - The fact that the extra collectibles are optional. This may not seem like a big deal but to me, who doesn't usually like looking for 'every little thing' unless I actually want to, and hate feeling like I HAVE to go on a scavenger hunt, appreciates this. Especially since, as far as I know, there's nothing for it except achievements and that feeling of 'yay, I got all of them!' But I don't feel like I have to miss out on a part of the GAME for not finding these things, especially on the first playthrough.  Cons: I don't have many complaints at all about this game, but there are a few minor things.  - Movement. Some of the time I felt I wasn't moving nearly as fast as I wanted to or should. Alex would go slower at some points and faster at others, which was weird to me. Also climbing, walking on paths, going up/down inclines/declines, using stairs or bridges, etc-- all of these were a bit wonky, also slow, and sometimes you could get stuck or stop at a corner or edge. Nothing that I couldn't work around and move to make it work, but still. Movement wasn't as nice as I'd like. - Dialogue options sometimes skip if you move out of the 'play area' coded for them and moves on to the next choice. Also dialogue options have a time limit, like in Telltale's games, except it's shown in the gradual fading of the speech bubbles, and sometimes it was hard to see or know just WHEN I can no longer choose a dialogue option to respond with. Considering the player needs the time of reading the options plus considering which one is the best, I also felt some of them didn't give me enough time to decide. So I would've wanted an actual time bar + more time to choose my responses. Still, not a big issue. - Saving. The game saves automatically, normally each time to pass from one area of the map to the next, or when an important cutscene has finished. It doesn't give you the option of saving whenever you want, and several times I had to go back to the main menu and replay a segment of the game over (at one point like 5-6 times) to do exactly what I wanted and how I wanted to. So I would've appreciated a better save system, rather than having to rewind a good 5-10 minutes back and go through dialogue and walk through areas I've already done like 3 times already.   Still, I wholly enjoyed my first playthrough of the game and definitely intend on playing through more of it. It was a great experience and definitely one of my favorites of this year.  9.5/10",

I originally held of playing this for... whatever reason, and I regret not getting into it faster because this game blew away my low expectations 10 minutes into the game.   Voice acting and Soundtrack.   When it comes to games like this, I.E a lot of time spent walking... and talking, voice acting is almost at the top of the pillar of importance for me. This game absolutely nailed the voice acting. It is superb. All the character have very unique and specific personalities and all the voice actors perfectly expressed it, it all felt genuine, I felt real emotion. 10/10 voice acting.  The soundtrack isn't something I absolutely loved but it was far from bad, some songs where great and the rest was just OK. It is a VHS Synth-Pop style soundtrack.   The art, graphics and controls.   The art-style of this game is very different to most, if not all games. The art mixed with the 2.5D game is a great combo. Great art direction.  Graphics are great, ran smoothly throughout my entire gameplay. Controls are also smooth, and simplistic.  This game could've easily been made into a mouse-only game or a keyboard-only game. I sorta wish they had gone with one of those, preferably mouse-only.    'Choices matter.'    There are countless amounts of games that  claim  choices made in the game matter, but just give the  illusion  of choice. Oxenfree is a true 'choices matter' game. Choices you make has impact on the game later, whether that be small flavour stuff, dialogues with characters or relationship changes. For better or worse? That's your choice.   The characters, story, emotions and gameplay.   All characters, as previously mentioned when I talked about voice acting, have their own unique personalities. Not going to spoil as to which character has what personality, I think you should discover that for yourself while playing the game. But who ever worked on the character writing did a very good job.  The story is indeed a big mystery and gets weirder and weirder the more and more you play. Has a ton of weird turns and the ending was fantastic(keep in mind there are multiple endings; I.E Choices Matter).  The game, at least with me, draws you in emotionally, whether that is negative emotions you have towards a character or positive feelings towards another. The game draws you in emotionally in many different ways at the same time. The music may perfectly fit the scenery and a major event may just have happened in the story etc...  The gameplay is not complicated but keeps you invested.   Replay-ability and a few more things.   This game has replay-ability the same way  Life is Strange  has replay-ability. You can replay the game to take a different path of choices, to discover more or complete more achievements.  This game is tagged as a horror game. It is not. It is also tagged as psychological horror, which it is. It is an ominous, Lovecraftian mystery thriller with psychological horror. It is not horror in the sense of jump scares, being chased by a boogeyman etc...  Polygon says:  A mix of freaks and geeks, Poltergeist and the best teen films of the '80s.  I wholeheartedly agree with that. This truly is an amazing combo of 80's teen supernatural movies, synth-pop music and a great cast of characters.  I really hope we see an Oxenfree 2.    Some criticism.   One of the things I disliked the most is how little time you have in  some  dialogues to reply. Not even  Life is Strange  or any of the  Walking Dead Telltale games  had such short dialogue response times in the most dire situations.  You almost always have the option to reply in a dialogue before the other character(s) are finished speaking. Most of the time that cuts of the other characters and Alex(you) start talking. Some times the other characters finish before you reply with your chosen dialogue. I wish the other characters always got to finish, instead of almost always getting interrupted by you.  The options menu is open to great improvement. Doesn't look like a lot of time or effort was put into the options menu.   Closing statement about the game.  Oxenfree truly is one of the best games I've played in 2016. Ahead of you lies a great adventure with a thrilling mystery. Great conversations with great people. Ahead of you lies a sea of emotion, suspense and choice.  I would recommend this game to anyone I know, the same way I'd recommend  the Walking Dead series  or  Life is Strange  to anyone I know. And that is a huge compliment.  Night School Studio truly put in a lot of work, love and heart into this, and they display that even more with the amount of patches they have released since Oxenfree's original release.",

Your decisions, unlike many games, actually have significant impact and can completely change the way the characters around you act, view you, or worse. Your decisions effect how you proceed, how you may percieve the events happening around you, and even the conclusion as a whole.  9/10, would have loved for it to be a bit longer (despite the obvious intention behind the subject of replay value), but I do not feel as if I was let down or shorted out of money in the slightest. On a side note, I think that this would also make for an awesome anime. Even if we don't get a sequel or anything for Oxenfree, I will anxiously watch out for whatever DOES come next from this developer.  My best recommendation for you, the reader deciding on if they want to buy it, is this. Do you like the mystery genre? Do you want said mystery to actually consistently move forward, be multi-layered, and have substance with a satisfying conclusion? Are you okay with playing a game that doesn't involve shooting things in the face? If you answered yes to any of these, BUY OXENFREE!",

The dialogue is well written and filled with choices. However, it can be hard to see how your choices actually affect anything until near the end of the game.  The art style is beatiful and sticks out from the 3-D models of the characters. The art makes the game feel alive.  The game offers lots of optional exploration, but does not do a good job of providing incentive to explore.  The slow pace of movement worked well for highlighting the story, but the pace discourages backtracking for optional objectives.  These problems seem insignificant compared to what the game achieves.  This game is great for anyone looking for an interactive mystery and story game.",

If you want an engrossing story that will make you care get the game     This game has choices that offer replayability, I looked up other endings and it has real impacts that make mine so bad when compared. I don’t think I’ll replay it as for me it would ruin the impact of my initial play through.     If you love mystery this game has it, it starts off with the characters and building who they are and slowly get weird and then creepy, with some sadness, then some joy and then more creepy. It’s just a well written story that I think would stand on its own against quality TV shows.     My only complaints are sometimes dialogue would get cut off by a triggered event, or my dialogue choice and they would never repeat what they were going to say. But this happened like only 3 times.     More onto the game, there are choices that matter in a lot of what you do, and how your friends react to you. I won’t spoil anything but they do have at the end comparisons to what other players did as well to gauge how awful or nice you are.( I had everyone hate, and didn’t mean to, kind of hurt me inside a little)     There are notes and radio anomalies to find out more about the story and mystery if you want. I didn’t collect them all because then it would feel less organic and more collectathon.      The mystery will pull you in to intrigue you, but like most good stories, it’s about the characters and how they respond/act to these problems, and my actions which I feel like an idiot on some of mine     They also have 40 minutes’ worth of documentaries, which I wish all games did. Because if I love a game, I want to know more about it, and the process, because I love that kind of stuff     This is what happened in my story for those who finished and what to know my outcome    My ending was happy where no one died, but everyone hated me, because I choose to sacrifice Clarissa but changed my mind. I was arguing with the ghost lady and thought I could win, which turns out I lost. Also I was so sad about what happened to Michael, he seemed like an amazing brother, and I feel so bad afterwards for realizing you could bring him back        As a game that is solely played for the story I can recommend this to everyone. It has natural sounding dialogue that makes it feel like it’s real. That to me shows great story telling in IMO    My Score:",

I did not find it engaging to play at all and felt that it would have probably been better if it were an animated TV series instead of a game. The element of the player's choices affecting the storyline was ambitious, but the options given were limited and I did not really feel in control over this at all.  I was left feeling extremely dissapointed with the teen drama plot and even more dissapointed with the average educational CD-ROM style gameplay.   I am generally slow at completing games (especially ones I find engaing and atmospheric as I like to explore the entire environment) and yet I finished this in just 4 hours. I looked into how my choices could have affected the storyline in different ways, but didn't miss out on anything except for the two more difficult (but predictable) endings to come to.

The art style was enjoyable and the characters and relationships, while a little cliche, were a little more in debth than expected. Also, I always enjoy searching for series of items and there are a couple of them in this game as well as a little mystery.  However, there are a few drawbacks to the playthrough of this game. The worst is that THERE IS NO SPRINT KEY. Walking through through the map multiple times is fine by me and I like games that don't force you down a hallway, but please, PLEASE give an option to sprint. At best it is anoying, and at worst I was frustrated enough to stop playing. Given how much I enjoy getting all acheivements, I gave up on finding all the rock stacks because of this flaw.  Next is while the story is interesting and different, it is definitely predictable once you get your first few clues. I felt like they could have had a great story with the whole time loop deal and their pasts as well as going into more depth with the submarine crew. Sadly, I felt very dissapointed with the ending as it seemed cut short and it gave me no real sense of accompishment or conclusion even though I know that the ending was meant to be kinda left open.  Which brings me to my final complaint. Pretty early on, I felt like my dialoge decisions weren't makeing any difference. This definitely made the game play not as enjoyable to me. I felt like whith how the game was set up and how short it is that they could of had the decisions make more of an impact. I can only recall one point in the game in which I changed something my character was going to do otherwise. I found the the only impact that these choices did make were very superficial and more for achievments than actual story.  I had high hopes for this game and it kinda let me down.

Suggestions:   If you can't make 'the walking experience' as fun as 'Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons', then make the walking short, or make the character moves faster.

It's a shame the game doesn't give that option.  And they NEVER seem to shut up. The only way your character has any input into the conversation is to constantly interrupt them by talking over, which is incredibly annoying because it means you're always breaking the flow of the dialogue to interject completely random comments.  The pacing is also terrible, too. Lots of walking left and right and left and right and backtracking to places at the other side of the map now you have a new MacGuffin. And for what?

            "review_text": "Wow, really just wow. Between the great voice acting, creative story, and relatable characters, Oxenfree is a real gem, worthy of a few playthroughs.   The art style is quite nice, reminiscent of older animated movies and television shows from the late 90's and early 2000's. Backgrounds have a painted, rich feeling that really makes the map lovely to explore. The characters art is simple, but unique, drawing an image for the character, but not setting them into an archetype. This game is really wonderful to look at. The antagonist spirits appear as shadows, punctuated with partial red outline that gives them a certain alien feeling of wrongness. Overall the art sets the feeling of the game wonderfully and helps to draw in the player right off the bat.  The story and dialog are really inspired and very well done. At no point do the characters really become stereotypes, although a few characters aren't completely fleshed out, by the end. Exposition is carried out tastefully and naturally. Natural is actually a very good word for describing the majority of the dialog in the game, it feels normal, the conversations feel like conversations that real teenagers would have. Lately, some games with characters around this age have tried to shoehorn in pop culture references that often feel contrived and awkward. Oxenfree doesn't try this, opting to instead have the characters interact like normal people. Bolstered by some fantastic voice acting, the script is wonderful. The story is involving and smart, tying the characters together and moving forward at a good pace. Combined with optional collectibles scattered around the map, the story really builds the history of the island and surrounding towns into something memorable.  In terms of gameplay and puzzles, Oxenfree plays it simple and safe. Controls are basic, although traversing the map can get a little slow. The scenery is usually attractive enough to make the jogs between areas at worst acceptable, and at best a joy. The game is verging on being a walking simulator, with all of the puzzles being very simply moving the mouse left or right. Different dialog options and endings make the game's replayability high, along with finding all of the collectibles that aren't required, but help to complete the world.  The score for the game is fantastic, matching the mood perfectly, the soundtrack for this game goes up there with Transistor and Bastion as some of my favorite videogame music.   Without gathering collectibles, the game will take around 2-4 hours to complete for one playthrough, with another hour or so for gathering the collectibles. The game, in my opinion, deserves at least 2 full playthroughs, as there are many different possible endings and choices that can be made.  Tl;dr:  Pros: -gorgeous art -great voice acting -wonderful story and dialog -good atmosphere -beautiful music  Cons: -very simple puzzles -slow movement makes for a little slogging  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Superbrothers:Swords and Sworcery and Kentucky Route Zero.",

In situations where you sometimes have to react quickly, this is a huge annoyance which shouldn't even be a problem. Black font would have fixed this; no idea why they chose to make the text white.   2. This one may just be me, but I would have appreciated a zoom feature. Being able to get a close up of the characters and backgrounds would be a nice feature. The wide shots are great for establishing the scenery, but I just want to zoom in every once in awhile to get a closer look.   Other than those two things, this is a superb game. A bit short with only a 4-hour playtime, but that's probably for the best - keeps the narrative tight and without needless fetch-quests and item hunts.

The story is interesting and quite original, you'll find yourself wanting to know more about the island, and the strange happenings that is occuring to your own character (Alex) and four other friends that your on this mystery island adventure with.   The dialogue is actually very natural, entertaining, and comedic. They really nailed this important part of the game. As a result I connected with all of the characters, maybe not Nona so much... But otherwise everyone has very distintive personalities, and people you may judge early on you can have a completely different opinion of later on in the game.   I've only played through once so far, and I feel like doing it again. So that's a good sign right? Repeat value, the alternative ending outcomes works well in it's favor.   It's not really scary, at all. But I don't think this was even an intent with the dev's, this is very much a casual indie game, and I loved this approach. Also the game really isn't a challenge in conventional ways. It simply forces you to make decisions which can possibly impact your friends lives in negative or positive ways, so if your into that sort of thing you'll probably love this game.   The art style is like a 10/10 lovely asthetic, it brings the world to life, seriously amazing job by their artists.   The soundtrack feels very carpenter inspired, with also what feels like a bit of a nod to disasterpeace. The composition are very minmalistic in nature, they never become to busy or present to completely pull you out of the immersive experience. The composer nailed the time period and atmosphere, but also showed a lot of restraint, yet the music never gets tiresome or to repatative. I loved how he processed all of the synth sounds with added tape delay giving that lovely wabble from the fluttering.   The sound effects are also spot on.   If you like mystery games, then I'm pretty sure you are going to want to experience this.   Rating: 8/10  ",

Oxenfree is beautiful game - the sound design and art style is excellent, as well as the voice acting. The story is even a bit intriguing as well, which is something you want in a game with the tag of 'story rich,' I guess. I usually find turn-based games boring and lacking the 'thrill' that they try to provide, however, because Oxenfree still has that 'adventure' element (walking around to different places instead of just having your choices dictate where you go) I find myself a lot more interested that I initially thought I would. I bought the game on sale (something I'd wait to do even if you love turn-based games as this goes on sale moderately frequently) knowing that if I didn't like it I could just return it, and if I did I wouldn't have spent a lot of money on a game whose genre I'm not always fond of. So far, I'm loving Oxenfree. I found myself not wanting to put it down even though I knew I should in order to get some work done, something I didn't think would happen.  All in all, if you love turn-based games than this game is definitely for you, and if you love great game design (sound, art, etc) but are a little iffy about turn-based games, wait until it's on sale and give it a shot. I did, and I certainly don't regret it. Kudos to the developers for making an anti turn-based games guy like myself not want to stop playing one. I can't wait to finish the story.",

Some people might be annoyed that the other characters sometimes shut up when you speak, which means that you won't get to see some lines, but that adds to the realistic feel of conversation that the game offers. And of course, none of that would matter if the voice acting was bad, but it's awesome. Very awesome.  By the end of the game, you'll have some optional challenges to discover even more about the secret story of the island, and besides that you have several endings, which means the game might grab you for some time. Unfortunately that didn't work out for me because the plot didn't really tick with me... And it's not because it's a teenager story, I actually found that very amusing, but because in the end it's like your actions don't really influence the course of things, and that doesn't allow me to sink into the story and feel it more personally. Moreover, while the main protagonists are characters with interesting backstories, the   ghosts who seem to be very important to the plot do not offer much character development  .  Besides that I still recommend the game, because I feel that overall it's worth it. It still got me engaged and I played it straight to finish. And it was fun! Meeting Clarissa, the brownies guy, and the step brother. I probably won't return to it but it was very nice while it lasted.",

            "review_text": "-- Some very minor spoilers ahead --  The thing I liked the most about this game is its dialogs. During an ingame conversation, you get limited time to choose what to say and if you don't - being quite is also an answer. The characters react very naturally and according to their personalities (and their relationship with you, which depends on your previous encounters with them). The time loop/dejavu is a pretty cool mechanic but it gets a bit dull towards the end of the game, because all the characters are able to acknowledge it. I think it would be cooler if you were the only one able to distinguish between the timelines. The radio mechanic was really cool, but felt a bit underused. I was hoping it would be more than just a resonance remote control. I kinda didn't like how you had to travel a lot in this game (and get stuck on corners), but I understand it's a vital part of the game and its atmosphere. There are multiple endings in the game, but they are not that drastically different. I didn't feel like replaying the game to unlock them, so I just googled them and they were meh to be honest.  Overall 7/10. Better than Life is Strange.",

The art style of the game is great and really suits the entire theme of the game, no matter the context of the situation. When the game is first welcoming you, the graphics make you feel cozy and safe. However, when the 'scary' bits kick in, the art style succeeds at making you feel very uncomfortable.   While 90% of the game is great, there are some elements that are lacking. The one that really stood out to me was the voice acting. You'd think that your friend staring at you with red glowy eyes would be enough for you to have a mental breakdown. Guess not. And the AI that follows you around is very bad. I had to restart an entire chapter because Jonas couldn't climb up the rocks.  This game is great, but not worth the original $21.99 that it is here in Canada.  Do I reccomend this game? Yes.",

There's much to be said about the positives of this game: whimsical graphics, an eerily beautiful soundtrack, well-defined characters with fantastic performances by their voice actors. The story follows Alex in such a way to reveal important information about her and her situation without spelling it out for the player, and the player gets to know Jonas in the same way that Alex does. The game isn't *terrifying*, but I admit I was startled quite a few times while playing -- enough to keep me on my toes, but not too much to make me anxious about playing.   Things I didn't like about the game? Well, there's not much to dislike, to be honest. I guess the speed at which the characters walk and climb objects is annoying, but a lot of the time, the dialogue fills in that space, and makes it less boring. The mechanics of the radio aren't super fun, either. It's an essential portion of the game, yet I had issues with the radio closing out when I was turning the dial, and making me repeat sequences of tunings over again. This, in itself, would be a harmless glitch if it didn't take forever to change the channel on the radio. It made discovering the 'anomalies' disinteresting to me since it just took so long to walk to the rocks and then tune the radio to the right station. But maybe I'm just too impatient.   A lot of choice-based games seem to streamline their endings (Life is Strange, one of my favorite games, is guilty of this); I didn't feel this was the case with Oxenfree. I felt like the things I said did have an impact on the game, and ultimately its end. And like I mentioned before, the voice acting was phenomenal. Personally, I would've been a bit more choked up about the situation than these characters were, but hey, to each their own. It's refreshing to play a storyline that doesn't have romance thrown in just to attract players -- Alex stands alone, and her relationship with other characters seems on a strictly platonic level. This means no gimmicky love crap, which I am sick of seeing! But honestly, this game was so well-executed that if they had thrown in a romantic interest for Alex, I don't think I would've been so bothered by it.   So what do I want to see more of? GAMES LIKE THIS. Real characters with interesting personalities, a gripping storyline, immersive sound effects, and simplistic yet gorgeous graphics make this game really come into its own. Night School Studio really delivered on this one, and I am already hoping to see them pursue other games of this style.  All in all, should you buy the game? For $20, I say go for it. You've got to be willing to listen to the story, though. Otherwise, what's the point?",

Best played all in on go, so set aside a good amount of time. If you leave the game early, you'll probably end up repeating a few things.  Would recommened this to anyone who like story driven games. Not for the action-loving types. If I had to name something that I think could have been improved on, I would have liked the ending (before the epilogue) to have been a bit more clear/explainy/revelatory.

The dialogue is quite clean and natural sounding; however I decided to turn on subtitles as it helps with some of the conversions throughout the game.   There are a few technical issues I noticed though, like a somewhat sticky world when trying to go up stairs. Once, my character got stuck climbing, but then snapped to the top. Once I was with one character, but got the voice of another. Another problem is the choice bubbles are sometime off-screen if you're on an incline.  These issues are not deal breakers, but can certainly break immersion. Those issues aside, I enjoyed the game and definitely recommend it if you're in the market for a cerebral exploration game.",

A gorgeous radio tuner scale popups when press a button and you can tune to different frequencies. It simulates an analogue radio, so you never get a perfect singal. There are some interferences, sometimes static, sometimes something important. Some messages needs to be written down (get some pen and paper). It's awesome. - AI - what AI? Where there is only one type of AI there - other NPCs follow main character. Nothing special, except that they can get stupid and blocked on cliffs/jumps. But Devs said they are working on fixing that. - sound - brilliant. There are some jump scares, there are some environmental sounds. And there is a radio and everything related to it.

At the moment, I've just finished my first run-through of the game. I'm very interested to see how things go my next time around.  The story is compelling and mysterious. You have to figure things out the best you can, playing around with the radio a lot and seeking out the collectables will help with that. I really love story rich games where your choices affect other characters' interactions with you and drive the story in different directions. This game certainly fulfills that.  I will note that as I started, I had difficulty with veeeeery slow framerate. It ended up being an easy fix, combination of turning off details in the game and needing to manually add Oxenfree to my Nvidia. No problems after I made those adjustments.  Highly recommend the game. It seems like it has high replay value, which I really look forward to.",

The game would have benefited of a dedicated ''run'' buttom, when you are stuck at the more 'slow/boring' parts in the game. Oxenfree's radio mechanics was something I hadn't seen been done In a video game before, the same can be said about the dialogue system, and I though it worked great. The artstyle fits the game perfectly. At least you get to look at gorgeous artwork, while you snail your way through the island. Some people might think the voice acting are a bit cringeworthy, in the same way Life is Strange was (which I personally didn't mind at all) At times I felt that the developers could have pushed the plot and horror a bit further, to really deliver on the shock effect, which is why i reccomend getting the game at a sale.  Anyways. When Oxenfree is at it's best it really shines.  Play it in one sitting if you got the time and don't care to much about collectibles and achievements.",

            "review_text": "For me, this game's dialogue tree was the real hook. While each of the characters fits into a familiar archetype (goofy stoner, ♥♥♥♥♥y cool girl, troubled step-brother), they feel like actual people with fully-realized identities. That the game makes you care about their fictional lives and whether or not they survive the night is a big reason to play if you enjoy story- and dialogue-driven games.  Another thing people have praised is the art, and I have to tell you that I dragged my roommate (a graphic designer) over to check it out with me. She was ecstatic, which told a layperson like me, 'Yes dummy; it's pretty.'  I have 1 criticism, and it is by no means game-breaking.  The lack of a sprint option means your character and her follower(s) trudge through the world at a base that does not --quite-- sell the, 'Holy crap we need to solve this so we can go home alive in the morning!' vibe. Thankfully, the game's small map and relatively short length will ease any concerns you have about the slow walking pace. I don't think the developers overlooked putting one in there: most of the time that you're walking there's dialogue occurring, so you WANT to hang back and not jump to the next part of the map for fear of missing something interesting. It's when you draw close to the end-game and you're trying to finish some of the collectibles for an achievement and there's no more dialogue unless you move the plot forward that it really stands out (which was in large part my own fault for not getting them while I was in the area). I would have LIKED the option to jog, but I also think it would have been detrimental for this game, as it relies heavily on its excellent dialogue and story to keep the player interested.  -----------------Potential Spoiler Below-----------------  Having finished the game once, I don't quite know how to interpret the ending. While I managed to save everyone, it all felt a little TOO perfect. I was suspicious about how neat a bow was being tied over our experience, and my suspicions seemed (somewhat) confirmed by my best friend Ren repeating something he'd said on the ferry ride to the island the day before. Maybe I'm reading into it too much... or maybe we didn't get away quite as unscathed as we thought. &lt;___&lt;",

            "review_text": " TL;DR:  Oxenfree is a graphically beautiful game with a gorgeous soundtrack, generous effects, a satisfying plot, and diverse characters that you don't have to love. Finding collectables is fun and doesn't feel like a chore, but not necessary if you find that part tedious. The tutorial is a little mediocre and glosses over a lot, especially when it concerns the radio mechanic and what you can do with it, so you may have to backtrack later on because of things you missed when you didn't understand it. Characters  will  talk over each other, and you  will  talk over them when you make any choices, so be prepared for multiple playthroughs to hear everything they have to say.    Oxenfree has been on my wishlist for nearly as long as it's been out, and I only recently bought it because it was on sale for $5 and I was afraid that I wouldn't like it and didn't want to pay full price. I probably couldn't have been more wrong.  To begin, Oxenfree is a 'supernatural thriller' about five teenagers who get stuck on an island and accidentally awaken some kind of omnipiscent, timeline-screwing beast residing on the beach.  What I liked about it: the soundtrack is gorgeous and really helps make the mood of the game, I was tentative to buy the music as well, but I was sold about halfway through the game. I found myself even thoroughly enjoying the ambience when there was no music. Given a few more hours of playtime, I would definitely start humming along to the more upbeat tunes.  The story is great, I felt immersed for all five hours I played this (accidentally played right through without a break, whoops). At first it may seen cheesy and just like any other romp about five teens on an island looking for some fun and relaxation, but the characters really came alive after a while, and the plot just keep right on going.   The beautiful graphics also sucked me in. The backgrounds are superb and the effects added during pivotal points are just all so  right . Not to mention that the extra artwork (i.e., the photos you receive) is incredibly good and so adorable. My only criticism is how the character models themselves looked, and perhaps it's only because I have a large monitor, but they seemed kind of polygonal and rough, almost like PlayStation 2 graphics. It's not crazy though, and I still very much enjoyed the graphics, especially the winding pathways and diverse environments.  Gameplay was also super, I adored the main mechanic in the game a lot, and it was really easy to use. I only wish that I had found out   how to use the radio for the anamolies and other radio-specific tidbits of information earlier,   it would have made some bits of the game a lot easier than they were,   (especially the quiz part in the facilities, whose answers I all found after the fact)   and I felt like I was  supposed  to find them earlier, and I just didn't know what to do with them.  This brings me to my next point: some parts of the tutorial were lackluster, and I missed out on lots of extra flavor text early on because I must have missed the fact that pressing 'spacebar' would have you interact with things. Additionally, characters talked on top of one another a lot, and whenever you make choices, you have to make them fast, even if characters are still talking, which forces you to miss out on so much dialogue because your character interrupts them whenever you make a choice.  Regardless, there are certain aspects and mechanics of this game that I absolutely loved but can't explain out of fear of releasing spoilers. For those that have played the game, I think I really loved the help you can receive from the community, and the help that you can give back. It really ties together the idea of the multiverse theory or whatnot.",

This game has a soundtrack that really carries the feel of the game - Characters (sure, they may seem a little cliche at times, but all the characters were well developed. They each had their own complexities. I felt connected to each of them while playing.) - Choices (The choices really bring this game to what it is. In many games, you have a black and white, good and evil, choice, but in this game everything you say can and will be used   against you in the court of the dead [kinda{depending on how you play you}]  . The amount you affect the game creates the depth it needs.)  Cons -------------------------------------------------------- - Controls (somestimes the controls got me momentarily stuck on a corner, petty I know) - Plot depth (I have not as much as some, but the story may be a little shallow.

If you don't, you can stop reading now and not bother with the game.  Oxenfree is pretty much a point-n-click adventure game without the point-n-click. Rather than clicking on stuff you just move around and tap a button or maybe whip out your radio and dial into a certain frequency to interact with stuff; the vast majority of the 'gameplay' is spent moving around and solving some really light puzzles. Don't expect anything stellar in that regard; it works just fine, but it doesn't excel.  The real draw of the game is the well-written characters and the decision-making, and fortunately you'll spend a lot of time with just that. The choices you make are fairly interesting and the dialogue is top-notch; if that's what you're here for then you won't be disappointed. There's also a bit of a twist to the decision-making that I think is super cool and I've never seen it done in any video game before. Saying any more would move into spoiler territory so I'll leave it at that.  Unfortunately, the game is bogged down by two things: an overall lackluster narrative and excessive travel times and backtracking. The narrative is gripping for about the first two-thirds or so, but takes a nose dive near the end. The atmosphere is fantastic and spooky, there're a couple good scares, and the mystery is compelling and you're drip-fed information at a nice pace at first, but it becomes a bit predictable eventually and has, in my opinion after having just finished the game, a non-sensical and generally underwhelming finale with the exception of that unique decision-making thing I mentioned earlier. As for the travel times and backtracking, most of the levels are pretty boring visually after the second or third time through and out of the roughly ten areas in the game you return to three or four several times while only visiting the others once. The levels are large and, for the most part, empty; this makes sense the first time you go through them as it gives you time to listen to dialogue and decide what to say next but with the backtracking it gets old fast, especially if you want to get all of the collectibles, which you probably will because they have interesting little tidbits of lore or world-building in them.  If you've got five or so hours to blow and just want to make some decisions and be taken on a ride without worrying about any of that pesky gameplay stuff, you could do a  lot  worse than Oxenfree.",

I've played it maybe four or five times, now, and still haven't found all the little exciting tidbits that really bring it to life. I think it takes me about four hours for a single playthrough, and every time, I find myself playing through the whole game in one sitting. It's an enthralling storyline, with great charaters, and I absolutely adore the concept. I don't get fully invested in games very often, but this is one I think I'll still be playing for a long time to come. The designs are gorgeous, the dialogue is on point, and I still feel immersed in the game every time I play.",

This game packs a lot of content into one thrilling adventure and I got super attached to the characters. I discovered an ending that made the game feel complete for me but that won’t stop me from going back and getting the fire starter achievement.  Thematically, this game is spot on. The environments coupled with the killer soundtrack leave such an impact.  In summary, you should play this game multiple times. Achievement hunting is actually fun and the multiple endings give you a real sense that your choices matter.",

As you progress through the story the gang's personalities really get a chance to shine with some of the, if not the best voice acting I've heard in a game. The dialog is very 'Until Dawn' like in that you only get a moment to choose from the dialog tree, which makes for a more honest response from the player. As with most games it's the not the main protagonist that creates an enjoyable experience but help from the supporting characters that really makes the experience feel complete. From the moment I started to the very end I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this game and highly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Purchased on Humble Bundle and at the price it was, I would strongly recommend it. I thought that this game would be like a standard point and click but I was very impressed when what I got was a polished, Telltale-esque style game where you can move your character around the environment with the wasd keys and can interact with certain environment features. You can also chose what the main character can say which is really neat because you can form a character that relates to your personality. The music and voice acting is top notch, strikingly impressive for an indie game. The music is brilliant and fits this game perfectly. The atmosphere is dark and compelling and the story will pull you in with its mystery and eeriness. It features a game mechanic that is unlike something I've ever seen in a game before, where you can progress the story by tuning in to different frequencies on your portable radio. So far, I'm loving what I'm seeing, and there is enough collectibles and dialogue options to warrant another play through. I think the less you know about the game, the better because it will help keep the mystery and enhance your experience. A lot of people go into this game expecting a real 'game' but I would rather call it an experience. There is not enough content and maneuverability to really consider this a 'game', but there is enough lore, music, art, and even small choices to be considered more than a movie. And if you go into this game expecting quality that of a movie with minor choice and exploration elements, you will be far more likely to enjoy this experience, as it is one I highly recommend.  Update: Just beat the game at around ~4.8 hours of playtime, but man, that story was spectacular. It was an experience that I would recommend to just about anyone that has played and remotely liked any telltale game. You get to develop relationships with every character and what you say determines how the story will go. Another really cool feature this game has is a New Game+ mode, (SPOILERS AHEAD)   called 'Continue Timeline' in which you can restart the story and the moments in the story where you see your future self will be controlled by what choices you made in your previous play through. This could lead to further understanding of the game, and a really cool sense of déjà vu as you begin to make more connections the more times you play the game.   All in all, I loved this game and makes my top five list for games with similar mechanics. 9.5/10 because of a minor bug I encountered in the game where I can't move and minor audio glitches, but overall I highly recommend!",

The one downside might be the €20 price tag for a game that takes about 4.5 hours to get through the first time, this is mitigated somewhat by decent replayability. Should you catch it on a sale it's definitely worth picking up!  All in all, this is a great game that I highly recommend.",

So here is why as a game Oxenfree is bad. The game mechanics are nearly non existent and basically all you do is walk from A to B to B and back again. In between you choose the dialouges which then determine the relationship you have with the other characters. So that's it, you don't do much more expect switching the frequency on your radio which ends up pushing the direction mindlessly until you feel vibration in your controller. So much for the bad, but everything else is fantastic. The story is great and refreshing, the characters loveable and actually reasonable in how they react and what they do. Everything about this game from the artwork over the soundtrack to the story is amazingly done and has an incredible feeling. So that's a 9/10, maybe even more. However the game mechanincs in itself, since nearly non existing are just terrible 1/10. So if you are looking for an intriguing story with loveable characters and choices that kinda do matter then this game is for you. But if you play games, because you like to play and don't care much for story this game will just bore you to death. I had a great time though, an awesome game, but that's because I favour story above great gameplay. However it did leave me a bit unfulfilled at the end I feel like I missed out on some stuff, but is it enough for me to come back someday? Maybe, to change some choices and explore the story a bit more. Sadly when I think about it, I already dread the mindless 'press stick into the direction you wanna go' gamemechaning, because there just not much else there.  Anway, If I could I would give this both; a big thumps up for everything exept gameplay and a thumps down for exactly that. In the end this game was so refreshing I still have to give it a recommend even though there could be a lot more game in this title. I grabbed it for 5€ at the steamsale, I think I would mind having payed the full price though",
