            "review_text": "Pros: Wide variety of units to use.  Explosions feel and look good. (In other words, it doesn't look like a fire cracker went off when a artillery shell hits a surface.)  Pretty good destruction Physics.  Covers both World War One and Two Warfare, so it caters to both interests. (Refreshing concept I have to say.) Detailed animations on units.   Cons: Limited soundtrack. (It's good but needs more variety.) Some bugs, typos, etc. (But nothing really new from what I see in other big games like this.)  Occasional wonky AI. (Although that isn't really a new problem in the Strategy genre.)  Tutorial covers only one portion of the game. (The battling portion of the game isn't too hard to understand. But it would be nice to have an explanation on what to do.)   Overall, despite the flaws Aggression has, it is still a fun RTS to play. Theres a huge amount of content in this game, so for ten bucks you can't really go wrong.         ",

            "review_text": "For anyone looking for a real time strategy game covering the turn of the 20th Century, keep looking. This game will only frustrate you as you fight against its incredibly clunky and poorly laid-out UI, its terrible control over units, battle AI that will swarm over your forces like a horde from the Steppes and a bare-bones strategic campaign. Imagine the campaign of a Total War game and the real-time combat of Men of War, water both down and then take out all the polish and refinement. Throw in a lack of feedback over what in the name of Sigmar is even happening (Did my entire army just get wiped out by a single infantry squad?), random events which require you to send your army to the ♥♥♥-end of the world to fight rebellions for your worst enemies (Good thing the German army was there to keep those damn commies from claiming France...) and cavalry that can destroy armored cars while shrugging off artillery barrages and you get this sorry heap.",
