            "review_text": "I first played this game on a 'Play for free weekend,'... I think I played about the first five minutes, and then bought it- seriously it was that good. This was one of the only games that I actually tried to play slllooowwwwllly, because I wanted to 'savor' the storyline. I would play 1 mission, then go on 5 or 6 sidequests just to make that main storyline last as long as I could. I love the voiceover acting, the writing, the graphics, the humor... where do I stop? Granted, the humor in this game is at times dark, and sexual... so just FYI, but if you're the person that enjoys a good 'edgy' joke, you will love the witty banter between the characters in this game.  A lot of people have tried to ask about the likeness to GTA IV... and called this a GTAIV copycat... well maybe... if you could say that GTAIV got an actual good port to PC, and maybe if you could say that GTAIV was actually funny... and maybe if the missions actually made sense and just walking around didn't absolutely frustrate the living Hotel Echo Lima Lima out of me. Also, a big part was the driving for me. GTAIV took the same car, and just copied it with different skins over and over- this game actually makes each car a little different, the handling, the speed, the features- and everything is customizable! You can put NOS on cars, change the rims, the decals, the paint, the color of the windshields... there are literally endless posibilities of driving around your pimped out car- also, it is so much easier to drive. If this was a GTAIV copycat, then SR did a MAJOR overhaul in the coding and scripting system for the driving because it is a breeze and joy to drive around in this game! :)  Synopsis: Funny, Witty, Enjoyable, (Did I mention Co-op camaign?! Only 2 people though :Notice) you will laugh, cry and connect with the characters and be able to play it over and over again. Do yourself a favor and get it- you won't regret :).",

            "review_text": "Saints Row: The Third. I thought it was a very good game. The thing that got me the most was the comical humor. The costumes and wardrobes, to the sexual references and balancing dead bodies with exaggerated weapon effects. I found this game to be a LOT beter compared to Saints Row and Saints Row II. If follows the time line, which is always a plus. The amount of things you can do, in my opinion, is much more and better than GTA. GTA is more on a serious note, which is good; Saints Row: The Third has some serious moments, but knows how to offer a laugh and good time with a balance.  The Story Line is pretty simple and basic, but not as generic as you would expect. You have a mixture of things, from saving your Homies, to fighting Gangs, Police, Military, Politicians, Zombies and Aliens. The gangs, especially one in particular are trying to take turf. What kind of gang isn't? The Genki line I found the most fun. It's basically like a game show arena. You fight your wat through enemies as well as the environments. It's definitely rewarding in the end, but not as much as it should be. In the end, you begin to gather forces for a take over. A bloody, deadly and annoying battle takes place.  The Combat System was very fun. Shooting duel pistols at enemies and watching them fly across the street. The Genki Mobile went shoots flames around all sides of the car as you drive, leaving a flaming inferno of destruction in your path. Falling from a disintergrating plane and shooting people as you fall with style. Fighting in wrestling rings with other gang members. Or you can do it with classic style by running them over with your cars and going on a shooting rampage. Some people may frown on it, but it is only a game after all. It could even relieve some frustrations.  Didn't have much of an Online Experience. It's pretty difficult to find others willing to play or willing to stay. So, unless you have a friend to play this with, I would recommend that more. At least if you want the achievements that go with this.  4/5 Singleplayer 2/5 Online/Coop",

            "review_text": "After successfully taking over the town of Stillwater in the last game, the Saints popularity and brand has exploded. Billboards are everywhere, they have their own energy drink, and people stop them in the street for autographs even in the midst of battle.   But it's not easy being at the top, it just makes you a bigger target. During the first mission, a bank heist goes wrong, and you find yourself fighting rival gangs and a military force in a brand new city - Steelport. This is an industrial city with big skyscrapers, factories... and maniacs with rocket launchers.  When you first bring up that world map, the art design and music instantly makes you think of Grand Theft Auto IV's map. But Saints Row isn't a realistic gritty sandbox where you pay bridge tolls and go bowling... it's more of an absurdest parody of the GTA games.   One of the biggest differences between the two franchises, is that here you get to live out your wildest character customisation dreams - which we'll always appreciate. There's an almost endless supply of facial tweaks, from eyelids to reptilian make-up... there's stacks of gestures and taunts... skinny and fat sliders, skin colours that include metallic yellow and green... and even a 'sex appeal' slider. There are also a stack of voices to choose from for your character. Most of our favourite voices are back from Saints Row 2, with one notable addition - the zombie.  It's quite an achievement that all of these clothes fit so well, with no clipping on all body types I tried. And there's something about seeing these crazy characters in cut scenes that not only makes this a very individual experience - but it just makes the main character seem even more insane then he/she already is. It also surprised me how well made these cut-scenes are, for a game that embraces the silly so much. The whole presentation is well done actually, and the selection of music on the radio stations is great too... but it's the mission music that really compliments the action perfectly.   The intro to this game is so exciting. In the first hour you'll rip a vault out of a bank, get kidnapped, parachute out of a plane, then shoot the window out of one coming towards you, take out everyone in it and then fight goons in mid air until you land in Steelport. They put a lot of work into those first couple of missions... and straight away you realise that everything looks better compared to the last game. There's a floppy, cartoony feel to the world and the character models; which you especially notice riding the sidewalk. All the models look more solid, with better animations in general. The cars look better too, with improved physics which makes for some excellent crashes.  Once you zoom around, you'll notice how smooth the world is. It's not beautiful but there's a lot on screen at once and there's a good draw distance, with a nice amount of detail. One thing that always bugged in me SR2 is the way vehicles would spawn and disappear as you looked left and right, which broke the world a bit for me. I noticed that they've fixed that.  Getting in and out of cars is something that you do a LOT in a game like this, and here in Saints Row 3 you actually have a 'quick hijack' which lets you leap into vehicles instantly; and that sums up the overall concept of this game - which is that it doesn't want to waste your time, and tries to keep things as fun and fast as possible. There's even a 'warp to shore' mechanic so you don't waste time swimming. Developer Volition really does a good job of keeping the gameplay streamlined.  Enemy AI is a bit hit and miss though, sometimes they won't notice you for a while, or they'll just stand out in the open. There's no cover system so their options are a bit limited anyway. And in most of the missions where you're fighting a bunch of goons, there are usually only 2 or 3 character types, which can't help but feel out of place for a game with such great customisation to your own character.  The story missions in Saints Row: The Third are full of variety. The best range from exciting base infiltrations, ambushes, jet missions and some other crazy stuff that I won't spoil for you. There's no longer any multiplayer VS which I don't think will be missed that much to be honest.. But now there is a wave mode.. called '♥♥♥♥♥D MODE' where you'll face off against a variety of foes that grow in size, and shrink... in a bunch of situations. It's horribly unbalanced but undeniably fun.  Now, this is a very crude game, and I have to say I've really wrestled with my morals on this one, and what I consider to be passably appropriate in a game like this. On one hand - I get the same maniacal joy of being an idiot, running people over and enjoying all of that that silly humour the same as anyone else. And I also get that this is a particular genre that is about crossing the line - while not taking itself too seriously... However, I can't help but ask myself what kind of a person is okay with grabbing a woman by the hair and face-slamming them into the pavement. It is pretty full on that you can do these special moves on the civilians - I was okay with doing it to the enemies, they're trying to kill you. There isn't much punishment either for hurting the civilians - cops come but you don't feel much of a penalty.   I felt with GTA IV it was treated as a real crime, and here it's just glorified with those special moves. Should that choice even be there, and does it need to be? Do I really need to wield giant purple ♥♥♥♥♥ - why is that in the game?  One bit that took it too far was the human trafficking mission... you open a bunch of crates looking for 'hoes' to which you can then keep as your own hoes for long term income, or sell back for a quick cash reward. On the boat where they're kept, you'll find all sorts of contraptions such as 'fisting machines'... and that crossed the line.   I'm so torn with this one, I almost feel hypocritical because some parts I was absolutely fine with, but other parts I just found abhorrent. I don't want be a prude, but the sexual and degrading elements of the game took it way too far and put a dampener on my experience. I mean, what's next? Violence against children? Would that be okay in a game like this, because it's not meant to be taken seriously so it just gets a free pass?  All in all it's a very good game, good graphics, good story and good missions. This is a game that should definitely be played by adults. If you can look past those few tasteless elements that just go too far, it's still worth an 9/10.",

            "review_text": "Okay, after playing this for 6.7 hours.. I had to write a review about this game.  Saints Row 3 (The Third) is essentialy one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life.  The cons and pros will be listed below.  Pros:  - Has a well-balanced story that isn't too childish and goofy or too serious  - Has a amazing customization system which let's you have almost any look you've probably dreamed about in your life for a character or for a vehicle. (Seriously, if APB Reloaded's customization system had a son.. it'd be this game's one.)  - You can punch people with a large purple d*ldo on a stick.  - The character can have 4+ diferent voices (and some can be a female voice, even if your character is a male.)  - There are over 25 taunts to choose from (all of them are adapted to your character's voice)  - The co-op is smooth and ISN'T BROKEN (Yes. I'm looking at you, GTA 4.)  - You can complete the story-mode missions with your friend in co-op.  - You can run over people's cars with a colour-customized tank (and the cars are only crashed on the spot you ran them over. It looks realistic.)  - You can revive your teammates or your friend countless times within 25-30 seconds after their health has run out.  - The missions are EPIC.  - There is a wide modding community.  Cons:  -I couldn't find any neko ears on the clothes stores, but I'm sure I can install a mod and get some.   My final veredict is a 9.9/10, buy this, NAOW. YOU NEED IT. (With all of the DLCs if possible, they are totally worth it.)  P.S: Don't shoot Professor Genki, he'll beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.",

            "review_text": "  'THE LAST TIME A BIG NAKED DUDE SAID HE COULD HELP ME, IT DID NOT END WELL.'    The highly anticipated review for me, because The Saints are special to me, unique as a part. Game, which was theoretically last chance, and last hope for THQ, was the biggest money injection they got, and they still wasn't able to stock up money, to cover up the bancrupt. THQ was with us since 1989, and it's hard to believe, that they're just gone ... Their message was sent through their games. Lots of their projects has been sold to those, who aren't capable of putting it to top level (I won't mention no one, because I have always respected work of the developers).  Saints Row: The Third as a game, and THQ as a dev has point from me, because they were in need of money, but they still wanted to be themselves, and didn't caught up with standard game bussiness model (using same old tactics, to be successful on the market).  SR3 is attacking sandbox genre with its uniqueness, and it's conquering with Grand Theft Auto series way more smart. GTA always trying to be realistic with a bit of 'american dream' .. SR3 doing opposite - total rampage, crazyness without limits, absolute unrealistic b-sh*t, octopuses on our heads, dancing pandas, fetish pedestrians, Safeword crib, big dild*s, robotic pu*sy penetrators.   Game is tribute to money, drugs, sex, fetish, and dolls, and that's why I love it.   Story is about the rise, about motivation and work to be, what you want to be. The Saints came to Steelport with 0 on bank account, without weapons, without connexions, but with DETERMINATION to conquere whole Steelport and they did it. (Of course I'm not taking it serious) Cutscenes are done pretty well, dialougues are well-written, brilliant, and epic funny. Characters was picked up correctly, almost every one from The Saints are unforgetable - Zimos, Shaundi, Pierce, Oleg, Kinzie and Angel of course.  Story-line is written like you finally think it's over, but it's not even in halfway. Like 3 times I thought it's over, but it wasn't, and I was glad, that story of killing anyone who came to our way continues. Behind story missions there are plenty of 'activities' and activities to be done. Like 36 assasinations, 30 car hijacks, 41 challenges, and around 40 activities to be needed done, for taking over Steelport.  Buying shops, and drug labs :X Upgrading mansions and cribs improving your control of the streets, money income and respect. You can tune up almost every car in-game, or find armored street-cleaner car and run over Zombies. Steal a jet, and ♥♥♥ up day of police officers, or just grab a tank, and roll through the streets, and running over cars. In CO-OP even better.  Soundtrack is great, playlist on the radios are solid .. Most significant is track POWER from Kanye West from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy album. This track in original describes power of Kanye, but it's almost accurate, to describe power of The Saints.   In the whole game, there's only 1 thing I actually don't like, and it is level-design. Artificially increased effort, of making game harder, just ain't worked, it was still so easy, but it just look stupid. I will name some situations .. For example, you had to steal military boat. It was just chilling on the water, behind the military camp. When you sneaked from back-side, and tried to stole the boat, it was just still marked on the map, but you couldn't deliver it, because you had to enter the military base, to earn 4 wanted stars, and then you was able to deliver it... Really stupid, and this happening almost every-time in the game, but it doesn't matter that much, because this game is untouchable!   Bonus Point: Shaundi   Rating: 10/10",

            "review_text": "  This review is more of a comparisson between Saints Row 2 and Saints Row: The Third, TL;DR: I'd recommend it if you want to play it co-op or you haven't played SR2 or SRIV yet. I would not recommend it for a series veteran or someone who wants any sort of good plot or pacing. This whole review is taken out of me describing to one of my friends the difference between SRTT(which he has played) and SR2(which he hasn't).  If you remember Saints Row: The Third had Let's Pretend in a somewhat easily accessible and commonly reached area of the map and it wasn't really hard to get there, just get a jet and fly there. In SR2 I had to look up a ♥♥♥♥ing guide on all the different stores and where to find them. In SR:TT using silly weapons dressed up in a fursuit was the rule, not the exception. Among criticisms aimed at SR:TT not only is the story, as I said, ridiculous to the point where it just seems like SR2's humour misunderstood as 'Oh yeah the jokes were seen as funny let's throw them in' when in reality the jokes were supported by the prolonged periods of seriousness that the protagonist showed while still being surrounded by a world of a pretty good mix of seriousness and stereotype. The pacing was, much like the story, also thrown overboard with all the subtelty that came to it. All the GTA Clone sandboxes start with the player owning nothing so they climb up to the top on a stairway of their own massacre victims and look down on the world and how far they've climbed up. This applies to all GTAs up to GTA V, the Saints Row games, even TT but to a MUCH lesser extent. In SR1 you join the smallest gang in the city, all in the middle of a gang war. SR2, you wake up from a coma, everyone you ever knew has either betrayed you or is currently dead or on their way to death(You save Gat from death row), and you have to take control of Stillwater back from the gangs that have set in after the Saints lost everything due to lack of leadership. In SRIV you're tossed into a virtual simulation of you having nothing and you win everything. In SR:TT the first mission gives you remote missiles and attack helicopters. Even the story in SR:TT relied all on whacky humour and was horribly paced in the sense that the beginning and ending felt separated from the otherwise alright-paced middle of the game. You could make an episodic game out of the beginning and ending and just take everything inbetween and release it as it's own full fledged sandbox game. Once Gat dies all seriousness and subtlety goes out the window, and it only comes back once you have to choose between saving one of two characters in the ending, neither character written well to the point of relating with either and having any sort of reason as to why you'd save either of them. Kinzie's the better developed character tbh. And it's weird cause I wonder if SR:TT was intentionally a watered down SR2, since the story is about the Saints becoming corporate ♥♥♥♥♥s making them intentionally a watered down version of their past selves. And Johnny Gat acknowledges it and then it's never even considered again. He has the balls to parody himself on robbing a ♥♥♥♥ing panic room dressed up as himself by saying 'Everyone wants to be Johnny Gat', he questions them being watered down and brings up how they've traded in their ♥♥♥♥♥s to become corporate ♥♥♥♥♥s, 'All for what? TV deals and an ♥♥♥-tasting energy drink?' Plus many of the systems in SR:TT feel like watered down systems of SR2, sort of like a parody of itself. The Grenades OR Consumables system is gone, as are consumables altogether. In SR1&amp;2 you could drink, get high, etc., and it's weird cause you're under a combination of all of those effects in that one story mission with Zimos where he makes you his undercover agent(s) dressed as ♥♥♥♥♥(s) to infiltrate the one brothel so they could've just cut that effect in half and made items that were just triggers for them. Instead of having 4 slots for throwables/consumables and choosing what to fill in you get 4 throwables throughout the game and they fit in perfectly, no choice required(Which is why Bo hated SRTT in contrast with SR2) and even the clothing system is a bare-♥♥♥ replica of SR2's. You had socks, shoes, underpants, pants, undershirts, shirts, jackets, hats, many of these having different ways they can be worn(On one side, unbuttoned, tucked in/tucked out) and in SRTT you have upper body, bra, lower body, underwear, shoes. Way less choice and customization. Some of the SR2 activities like THROWING LITERAL HUMAN FECES AT THINGS and fightclub were gone and instead you got Genki's activity(Which is probably the most fun activity in and it was expanded upon in the DLC and the sequel, overall the most solid part of the game, and it's whackiness was different from the game's typical whackiness, thus contrasted way better than everything else) Plus SR2 also wanted to explain to you why what you were doing was justified even though there was no way under the Sun to justify that ♥♥♥♥ which ended in intentional-cringe-humour where you watched this guy get talked into throwing himself at cars for insurance money, or starts destroying ♥♥♥♥. In SR:TT the activities are barely explained as ZIMOS RUNS ESCORT SERVICE DO ESCORT PLEASE!!! and YOU ARE SCARED OF TIGER SO DRIVE IN CAR WITH TIGER!!! but most of the activities aren't even explained. In SR2 the protagonist just casually gets talked into setting themselves on fire in a fireproof outfit and driving a quadbike along a track setting things in their way on fire for money. It makes absolutely no sense but the game tries to explain it anyway and it comes out as comedic brilliance. In SR:TT the few activities getting explained are never said 'no' to by the Boss and they've got a basic threadbare explaination that is played whacky. In SR2 the activities tend to be played straight-faced and completely self-aware, usually with the boss saying 'No' at first glance, and the Boss is more relatable yet distant to the player as a result. SR2 had Gat as the comic relief character at many points, and the Boss filling in when he wasn't, however he wasn't afraid to get serious, and neither was the Boss. In SR:TT everyone's the comic relief character and as such the comedy doesn't really relieve anything. There's no non-comedy to be relieved from. Ok that was all, good luck actually reading all this ♥♥♥♥. If you do want to try and see how far you can read into it, the first message after me typing five messages in all caps is the first message about Saints Row. oh and also I forgot to mention SR2 not only had better writing and pacing but it also had enviromental storytelling and worldbuilding that was just fantastic, from the world actually having attractions and places to visit that stood out from the rest of the entire map, but there were things civilians would do that were just great to watch and made the world come alive. In SR2 if stood still for 20 seconds your character would do an idle animation, and sometimes if you were near an 'action node' that wasn't occupied by a civilian you would do that action node yourself. The protagonist could ape the civilians in selling hotdogs, buying hotdogs, joining cheerleader teams, conversation with the civilians, examining products on shelves in-stores, etc. and the civs were actually pretty cool and weren't just street-roaming zombies like in SRTT/SRIV. They'd go streaking, they'd get in trouble with gangs, they'd get in trouble with the law, they'd even commit suicide and it was so cool in a morbid sort of way. Jumping off rooftops, jumping off bridges, you name it. It'd be so ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious if the devs didn't make the suicide action nodes AI only and let you commit suicide by accident by just being idle in the wrong area. Just go pick up the phone and have your Boss toss himself off a ♥♥♥♥ing building. It'd be great.",

You play as the leader of a gang, doing quests and defeating rival gangs or the government to gain control of the city. Cutscenes, plots, even weapon and vehicle are hilarious. This game makes no sense (in a good and fun way)!  Although you are able to start roaming the entire city very early in the game, the story progression, game difficulty, as well as your equipment and arsenal are well balanced and not overwhelming.  (Note: Don't use the DLC vehicles too early in the game, or it will be too over-powered and ruin some of the fun. But feel free to use them to cause mayhem to the town if you just want to blow some stuff up. xD)  This game also have some of the best musics featured in the in-game radio stations. My favorites are the classical musics. It is fun to watch how the main character drive a huge tank, causing carnage to the city, while listening to soothing slow classical music. LIKE A BOSS!  This game features a drop-in drop-out co-op mode. Your friends can join your game anytime, and playing with friends will make this game even more fun!  I have only encountered one problem with this game. During startup, the game asks whether you want to use DirectX 9 or 10. DirectX 10 will always crash my system 20 minutes into the game. While DirectX 9 will have no gameplay problem, the framerate wasn't as good.   DLC Reviews",

It may not purposely have a more serious storyline, yet it leans more towards a rather melodramatic  badassery . The game itself in terms of features, is rich. You'll have a huge variety of customization opportunities to form your character to just the way you imagined it. This applies to the fact that you will also provide your character a personality, with choice of voice, the way they compliment and/or taunt, etc.  The controls are kind on you, incredibly beginner-friendly with some room for mastering. The aiming is great but quickly becomes irrelevant as you can upgrade your firearms to carry explosive bullets for instance, which has a fatal spread, hence the lack of necessity of aiming, unless you're all about sniper rifles.  The vehicle customization is beyond nonsensical, but in a pleasing way. You can customize almost any vehicle, I have yet come across a vehicle that cannot be customized, but having that said, I have yet ridden all vehicles into the tuning garage either.  Personally I'd certainly recommend this game for anyone that are looking for an absurdly inappropiate playground, to indulge your absolute bizarre fantasies, under any catergory, you can just about make whatever you please out of the game. You sick f*ck.  Oh and also the graphics is speechless. At least for my standards.",

I was pleasently suprised when it had enough of it's own thing going to get myself and the friend who got it for a multiplayer co-op game to actually have a lot of fun going through it.   By the time you beat the game you should be a high enough level to be a one man wrecking crew if you have spent your money appropriatly. Which can make the final confrontation kinda lackluster because you are so close to immortal it's not even funny.  The gameplay is solid with the exception of a few of the activities you have to do. They are not exactly explained well and can possibly force you to complete them with trial and error. Or go look up how they are done.  The graphics for this game though a little dated now are still pretty solid and hold up as long as you remember the game is several years old.   Last of all I highly recomend playing this game with a friend in co-op mode over just a solo play through because you and your friend can get many a great laugh out of the pop culture references and just creating shananigans for your co-op partner to deal with.",

The open world is vast and explorable, the weapons, both temporary and permanent, are fun to play around with, and the character customization has a wide range of options.  If I could recommend any version of this game to get, it's the PC full package edition. It's only $10 more and features all of the DLC, which can add a lot more gametime when you add mods as well.",

This game is very very very not subtle on the content it rips off on and does it too well. Grabbing plenty of movie, game and music references to add in to this comical diss game to GTA. If you like GTA you will love this game. If you hated the pacing and restrictions to GTA you will love this game. Great game to beat and unlock ♥♥♥♥ in as well ♥♥♥♥ing around the game being a blast. The OST is great featuring a wide variety of popular and lesser known artists. The developers of this game share a trait simialr to the likes of Tyler, The Creator: NO ♥♥♥♥S GIVEN in regards to numbing anything down etc. Unique and distinct in it's own way as well as being worth full price for such a great experience. The DLC is almost a necessity to fully enjoy this game and is worth getting the bundle pack for it. Overall I give this a 10/10 both critically and personally. Strong replay value helps make this game a very ideal choice to purchase. AN essential on steam for it's great mods etc.",

It NEVER takes itself seriously.. you can upgrade your pistols to have explosive rounds, beat people with a giant purple ♥♥♥♥♥ baseball bat, throw a 'fart in a jar' at people, run around completly naked and you can even create a full on zombie to play as complete with a zombie voice! The humour is awesome and the gameplay is great.

            "review_text": "As an analogy, I have always seen the 'Saints Row'-series as the younger, funnier and immature brother of the 'Grand Theft Auto'-series. This is what the creators of SR probably had in mind when they were making their game. The rate of absurd immaturity isn't necessarily negative, au contraire; it creates that light and amusing atmosphere that I've come to expect of Saints Row.    Pros:  + Very amusing + Absurd, though great humour + Simple &amp; clean upgrade system + Great character &amp; vehicle customisation (which personally always makes the game a lot more fun for me) + A lot of diversity (more on this in the cons though) + Cool NPCs   Cons:  - Main story arch is too short in my opinion - Frustrating AI (which is a problem in lots of other games too) - Although SR likes to mix up the missions and activities, you might actually feel that the everything is quite repetitive - Even though the NPCs are great, I think that you should be able to spend more time with them and get to know them better, they are after all ' your crew'   Conclusion:  Saints Row: The Third is a great successor to the previous game and meets my expectations of the game, which doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. Playing the game was very satsifying though I doubt I will playing more than two playthroughs, except if my OCD were to kick in and make me want to get all the achievements.  My score for SR3 would be 7.5/10",

The one thing I can say about Saints Row the Third (SRTT) is how quickly it makes you forget your expectations and just have FUN. It wants you to be random and just enjoy the game without consequences; something I suspect Volition went out of their way to ensure. The controls (aside from the still foreign weapon select) are tight and the controller integration is very solid (Thanks Team!) so it made SRTT a very enjoyable/playable experience to me.  The story is just hilarious, the graphics are still holding their own and the driving is just fantastic compared to other titles (I am looking at you GTA). In fact, every game should have a quick steal option for cars modelled after SRTT. This series has always done Character Creation well but this time around it is just MENTAL. There is a slider for EVERYTHING! You can truly make your character your own which is just an awesome finishing touch for this game.  My only two complaints with the game are prehaps the side missions could have had some degree of integration with the main story (aside from just being fun things to do) and that the story missions (whilst being selectable in the phone) didn't have a clear indication of which order you should play them in. I kind of just shotgunned an entire characters worth of story in a single hit and got a bit lost until I realised it tied in with other missions I hadn't played yet. These are just minor gripes however and you might have a completely different outlook on these issues.  So, should you buy it? Yes. It is cheesy, over the top wild action and I had a great time playing it. Well done Volition!  8/10.  Also Burt Reynolds.",

Saint's Row 2 had comedy, serious stuff and all - it made you feel like you were the badass of the first game, and you're back to claim 'the row'.   This game however kinda ... well it's like they felt 'people are going to think we're serious competition for Grand Theft Auto - lets make it look like we were just kidding around. I don't want them as enemies.'  While the game itself was fun, I was really disappointed on it went from serious/funny, serious/funny to just out-right rediculous and never serious. It didn't feel like you were a badass in one and two - it felt more like the world around you (in game) is just an enormous joke. The game would be better if you were Deadpool - then it'd make sense. But you're not Deadpool... why they went in this rediculous direction with a game that could've rivaled GTA... I don't think I'll ever understand.   The game itself is still fun, just don't hope to see a continuation of the badass from part one and two.  And ... seriously guys... please kill Peirce. He's... j... just kill him, please.

The game only gets better in co-op, giving you all sorts of crazy options on how to play through the side activites and main quest.  The vehicle selection is awesome. There are tanks with laser cannons, space ships, hover bikes, and of course normal vehicles. The customization is amazing for the things you decide to keep ahold of and put in your job. Slap on cool tires, a slick paint job and tinted windows with a neon green interior if you like.  The character creator in this game is pretty awesome. You can spend alot of time on it, tweaking your character to be your avatar, or going over the top and making something completely insane. There are multiple guides out there that tell you how to make famous characters, which can make your stay in the game even more interesting.  Pick this game up if you get the chance, it's dropped in price and well worth it. Even the DLC packs are huge fun.   If you can grab a friend to play through the game with you, it's a TON of fun.",

The sheer number of hairstyles, outfits, and costumes for characters was really fantastic for anyone who values character creation/customization. Vehicle customization is also incredible and almost every vehicle has many mods that can be applied to it, not to mention the multitude of colors and wheels that can be applied.  ~Ridiculous gameplay. Not as 'out-there' as SR IV, but it had its silly moments. I never had a boring experience in this game, save for some of the early missions which are based on activities. By the end of the game, you can unlock damage negation to just about everything except for melee weapons (for whatever reason), unlimitied sprint, boost for all cars, all of which make the gameplay more about just having fun.   ~Infinite replay value. Like most open world games, it's hard to run out of things to do. In the immediate post-story game you can complete any and all activities that you haven't already, you can purchase all stores for additional income, there are DLCs that can be completed at any time, and there are some optional side missions to keep you entertained. In the long-run, once everything you can possibly do is done, you can still resort to doing whatever the hell you want because it's Saints Row and its just pure fun.  CONS: ~Multiplayer with lesser computers. Saints Row was built for consoles, there's no denying that, and because of that, the way multiplayer syncs up with your partner is through framerate. That means if I'm running it at 60fps, and my friend is running it at 10fps (because their computer is garbage) then your characters are going to warp around because the game can't sync. This was never a problem for me because I never played with that person, but if your computer is low-tier, I would stay away from multiplayer.  ~Pierce. Pierce is in this game and I kept waiting for a mission where I could choose whether or not he can continue his existence. There was no mission to kill Pierce. Fortunately, you can *SPOILER* sell-out Birk.  TL;DR: I don't think I have ever had this much fun with a game. In terms of fun and rewarding gameplay, story missions that didn't get old, and laughs from the excellent writing and zany gameplay, it has not disappointed me.   9.9/10  FINAL THOUGHTS: Buy this game, I honestly had more fun with it than Saints Row IV because vehicles and weapons still have purpose in this one.",

The way Saints Row put in the gang-areas in the game is just wonderful. You're just riding down sunset and before you even know WTF happend, you're getting attacked by over-sexualized women (i ain't complaining) or geeky jedi nerds or hell even Luchadores for that matter.

At the core is fairly basic arcade-like TPS kill-hordes-of-enemies gameplay topped off by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of character and gang upgrades to the point where you'll always be looking for something meaninful to buy. Money doesn't grow on trees and the game has a fun property purchasing metagame that lets you widen your money flow as well as get a discount for your various ganger disposing tools at owned buildings.  Running around with a gang is fun, but I've only ever found the giant hulk homies to really have a functional purpose outside of being a diversion. Character customization is great, however gang customization is more of a gimick as it really doesn't let you change much about them outside of what breakdance move they greet you with.  The music in the game is pretty enjoyable and modern and the adult swim radio station is hilarious and a great addition to the arsenal.Unfortunatly, there is no on-foot mp3 player like there was in the previous saints-row so you can't go raiding strip clubs to Kanye West's 'Power' every chance you get.  There are many ways to get around and blow ♥♥♥♥ up as well. You can also drive anything from a souped up street car to an APC with a laser gun to a car crushing tank to a helicopter to a VTOL jet thing to an alien space craft to a personal plane to a tron bike.  Last and perhaps least, is the story line which has a bunch of interesting characters which even includes your own character who's an integral part of each scene and indeed the game's personality. The storyline isn't bad it's just not great. The game tries to put you into a variety of different environments which is nice, but it all pans out the same way more or less.  I'd give this game a solid 8/10.",

There’s much to do in the form of activities, assassinations, vehicle thefts, finding collectibles, and various challenges. You get respect and for doing nearly everything, which allows leveling up and unlocking skills. You also get cash, which lets you buy real estate, upgrade weapons, and buy countless customizations for you and your vehicles.  The story is told through diverse and creative missions, always featuring something crazy or bombastic. Very strong voice acting and mostly funny dialogue by memorable characters helps keep things interesting. Humorous vehicles, shops, outfits, billboards, and radio stations provide SR3 a real sense of style while traveling through the city. SR3 definitely knows how to keep you playing, with about 20 hours of city amusements outside of the actual story missions and about 10 hours of story content.  SR3 isn’t going for balance or difficulty but simply pure spectacle. The game is a slight challenge at first, but you become formidable after 5-10 hours and downright unstoppable at 15-20 hours. The Full Package edition also grants you very powerful weapons and vehicles for free. This imbalance would ruin other games, but it works well in SR3 because SR3 is about doing as much crazy stuff in the least amount of time.  Unlike SR2’s terrible PC port, SR3 on PC runs, looks, and plays very well. Speaking of inevitable comparisons to SR2, you’ll enjoy SR3 more if you’ve never played SR2. This is for two reasons: 1) much of SR3’s content and activities are recycled from SR2; 2) SR3 has less content and a smaller world. Basically both games are worth playing since each has its own strong points.  Ultimately, SR3 is like chocolate decadence, pure indulgence. It is very easy to get caught up in the mayhem, even finding it hard to go back to “serious” games. However, like any rich dessert, at some point you have to go back to more substantial offerings. Still, SR3 is undeniably great fun.",

            "review_text": "While I'm not a fan of comparing games, it goes without saying that one of the biggest questions about the Saints Row franchise revolves around its resemblance with the Grand Theft Auto series. Is it better? Is it much different from GTA? While the first is a question I don't want to involve in a review, I can confidently assert that Saints Row is in its own league.   Saints Row is a free roaming co-operative third person shooter packed with cheap humor and gang violence. However, that does not necessarily make this a bad game. I would actually say Saints Row III has very much succeeded in making cheap humor great and gang violence entertaining as far as video games go.   The setting of SRIII takes place on an island where a consortium of three large gangs are in charge of the city, and you as player have to topple these gangs in order to make your gang (the Saints) dominating. Whereas the GTA series does this through accepting certain missions from one gang against the other, the power of SRIII lies in its characters and scripted storyline as well as the complete individuality of the side missions. The fun is doubled when you bring along your friend over Internet/LAN co-op gameplay and you both develop your character traits such as combat skills, your looks, and your personal stack of vehicles (which conveniently respawn in the garage regardless of how you maul and destroy them, pretty handy).   This all works out pretty well, though not flawless. Besides an unconvincing world (which makes immersion very hard), SRIII has a couple of nasty bugs that can ruin your savegame so I recommend not writing your progress to a single slot the entire time. This should not be a buzzkill for the fun though, not when the gameplay is so fluent and the theme accompanied by proper fitting music. I would personally rate this game as one of the better games in its genre, much like what I did with Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Hitman. Luckily, Saints Row III is on sale during vacations quite often, the perfect opportunity to lock yourself up in your room and play through this game.",

Although, it gets very repetitive and sometimes it tends to crash when you shift + tab, maybes its just me. In addition, it began crashing during the first few times i played the game, i had to do some research to solve the problem, it was a simple and easy, but time consuming problem. Overall, I really liked how the game turned out and how they gave you the option to chose what you wanted to do in certain parts of the game.

            "review_text": "Are you looking to buy any of Saints games? Here you will get some tips on which one's better. I recommend buying Franchise Pack because all three games are amazing! Review is SPOILERS FREE!  Graphics and Optimization. Saints Row 2 runs at various framerate with spikes along the way at random moments. Overall it looks ok to me because of great details in cloth, characters models and surroundings.  Saints Row 3 looks like a game I would recommend to a person with the outdoors fear because it looks soo real. Maybe because I launched it right after SR2? The greatest thing is that this game runs much smoother than the previous one.  Saints Row 4 runs even better than SR3 when having the same engine. Amazing job, devs!  Game World Saints Row 2 has many types of pedestrians scattered around depending on a location you're in. You can find students and goths at University, nurses and doctors at hospitals, bums at local hoods, jugglers on a beach and skaters in mall. Random citizens at diners use laptops, call their friends via phones, eat things and drink popsicles. The best thing about it is that all parts are connected to each other and interacting in different ways. Walking with a straight back katana holder stumbles across a policeman. After yelled curses they start to shoot in each other. Suddenly a driver decides that it's enough red lights on this street so he jammes a gas pedal on the floor and turns on a sidewalk where are the first two men are. On top of that is ability of all characters including the player's to use drinks and food and weed at any time. All this makes exploration in this game is so amazing. Visiting the same place makes you recall different facts that you discovered. It makes exploration a rewarding system in which you always look up for something amazing around a corner. There are many different buildings you can enter and explore. Some of them are parts of missions and some are not. For me-this game's world is the best of GTA 1-4 and other saints row games because it's living and it's awesome. Saints Row 3 looks the same at the first sign - the same pedestrians and random folks outside in parks, on piers and in shops. Their look is more casual like what you see in real life. Rarely you come across individuals such as a peeing old man and weird black man with a chicken commercial on a t-shirt underneath weird massive rags. Character's movement is slower and actions they make when something's happening around are slower as well. Overall it feels like the world has less energy in it. The same is about Steelport itself. Everything is sleepy and doesn't catch your eye like in SR2 or GTA Vice City.  Saints Row 4, however, is a different story. Weird virtual effects on buildings, water and citizens are catchy and interesting to explore. Everything implemented connects very well with the whole idea of a matrix world. The more you progress in the game the more weird everything becomes. It's easy to just jump from a roof to roof, then go explore that big glowing alien tower, then suddenly become interested in something red below you and finally find yourself doing that for hours. Since you're acting in Steelport again, it's always cool to find places that you remember and compare them in both games. Until the final mission you're stuck in the night.  Difficulty Saints Row 2 is the hardest game of three. I can't say how many times I respawned in front of hospital. What makes it so hard? Firstly, there's no upgrades likein the other two. You simply start and end with the same amount of health + bonuses from side quests. The game itself is much faster and random events occur all the time. It's way harder to fly helicopters. During shooting you want to hide behind something like trashcan. Does it make game more interesting? Yes! It doesn't look hardcore but provides some challenge which for me is an essential thing for any game. Saints Row 3 throws at you masses of enemies. A fight may start calmly but be warned! In a few seconds you'll be overwhelmed by enemies. They will send simple cars, then mutants and then brutes and everything times 10! The same thing is going on during missions. Also there are upgrades that help a lot especially when you hit a high level and become unvulnarable to bullets, car explosions and fire. Overall yes it's a hard game at the beginning and then it becomes easy. Saints Row 4 has spawning aliens and robots and cars with cookies. It has upgrades as well that protect you from certain types of damage and increase health.The main difference from SR3 is an enemy spawnign rate which is much lower. The increased amout of danger levels all the way up to six means that you'll be dealing with various enemies as it grows and at the 6th it'll be a 1v1 fight agains a guard.  Driving, Cars and Driving Cars Saints Row 2 has the most types of cars I've ever seen: all your normal and fancy defaults as well as busses, bulldozers, weird food vagons, limos, airport baggage carts, trailers, trucks, bikes. Saints Row 3 appears to have a little bit less amount of 'normal' cars but definately has more weird cars developed mainly for combat and destruction. My favorite feature is drifting. Using cars such as Bootlegger and Churchill allows you to do long around the corners, 180 degrees and spin drifts. Everything about it feels and looks good! Saints Row 4 is more about super jumps and running so it's not much to say about cars because they're more just of a things somewhere below. You use cars mainly during missions where using of superpowers are limited or disabled. The game still offers you some new fancy crazy vehicles.  Story Saints Row 2 has three main scenarios each of them is a story of how a gang died. Missions vary in places and objectives and events. For example, sneak into a power plant and steal a radioactive barrel. Escape with it on a heli and mess up with an enemy boss by using it as a ... in a different way. Homie characters are developing during cutscenes. Saints Row 3 has even more variety and characters and things. It's one big quest about restoring control over Steelport. Missions and sidequests come along. Saints Row 4 has the most epic story that involves so many crazy and awesome ideas. That's where the creativity flows. Characters development uses connections to the previous games as well as explanations of past events. Although the game features only a couple new characters it keeps it on a high level.  Co-op mode Saints Row 2 is running without Steam features such as Achievements and Steam Hud menu and Join Game options. If you're not playing with a friend in the same network you'll have to use a third party programm such as Evolve. However, connection is pretty smoove even though between me and my friend are 7.000 miles. The guest has all features that the host has except: no crew and homes costumization, can't buy property and no side quests progress will carry on in singleplayer and games with other folks online. The gameplay is pretty awesome where you drive around together and do missions and even control your roles in side quests. Saints Row 3 has an easy to connect Steam support to all players - just start a game and right click on your friend and press 'invite'. You can do things together, you explore the city together, you do missions together. Everything is easy and works just fine. The guest cannot costumize crew or houses but is able to purchase property to recieve an hourly income.  Saints Row 4 has the same easy way to connect to each other. Co-op game still exist on missions and on some side quests however is almost dead during free roaming and collecting stuff. Players use super run and super jump but there's just no way to do it together or simultaniously. So the gameplay looks like this. You and your friends are doing things and sometimes start missions and do them together. After the missions they again move in different directions.  Have fun.",

First of all the storyline is wonderful, and the perfect balance of silly and serious. It somehow manages to make me laugh and make me feel extremely awesome in the same breath. And its even better with a friend, who sometimes even has different things to do in the missions than you. It also gives you just enough amount a choice when it comes to what quests to do and what to do with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you just raided a barge to get. Even though when it comes to building to go in, the world is pretty restricted, it never feels that way. The progressive takeover of the city is my favorite part. It is always satisfying to buy a store and see how much more money you are getting per hour. The way you can take any car and put it in the garage makes faster cars accessible, but still makes it fun to find a lambo and hopping in. The costimization could've been better for the aircrafts(and by better i mean any custimization, but thats my only complaint there. All the vehicles feel satisfying in there own way. The same activities get stale after a while, but theres a lot to do in between activities. Just driving around the world is fun! If you have a friend to play with you, the game is twice as good. All the activities and quests are more fun with someone playing with you. Due to the general hilarity of the game and the openess of the world, many freak accidents and funny car crashes have left me falling out of my chair laughing. This is a wonderful game that i still play to this day. The campaign and open world aspects keep me playing over and over again. At the moment im replaying it with a friend, and i am having the best time even just roaming around. Were already 11 hours in and not even close to finishing the campaign. The graphics have held up, while the price has dropped because of saints row IV. This game is extremely cheap for the amount of enjoyment you will get out of it.

The sense of humour from the characters in this game bring comedy to a whole entire new level I would sit at my computer and feel as if I am watching a comedy show actually no playing a comedy show game! I love the quirky comments the characters make and the brilliant different attituides and personalitys. I could write a fu.cking book about the characters but Its time to move on to another topic - [ATTACKS AND WEAPONS AND UPGRADES] There are various combos that you can do to take down your enemies without weapons like kung foo sh.it y'know what I'm on about. The game also has a great upgrade system that allows you to choose what parts of the weapons you own to upgrade you can choose if you want it upgraded or not! So many different weapons and upgrade for them its amazing!!! and you get to use all weapons in different missions whether you own them or not! AMAZING!!! [MISSIONS] This game is master of missions the campaign is so bloody awesome you'll play for hours but it took me forever to actually finish the campaign to the fact I was so entertained by the side missions!!! lol! ofc the campaign was better but the side missions will also keep active for hours! I doubt any1 is still reading this far but I'ma continue anyway! [VEHICLES] SOOOOO many different boats, Cars, Planes, Choppers, Bikes,Tanks, Armoured vehicles YOU NAME IT! From high powered tech tanks to tentris styled block tanks and from Super speed future bikes to light bikes from Tron its amazing! Vehicles too have amazing customization settings!! so many different styles and things you can add to your cars to make them unique [MULTIPLAYER] OMGGG Me and a good mate Have so much fun together on Multiplayer The best thing is all your player states can be brought into their game yes that includes all your progress, Customized vehicles DLC items and Player states and skills! you can complete missions together and earn money and achievements cars and items in anothers game and bring it back over to your single player game HOLY ♥♥♥♥ IT DOESNT STOP GOOD GAME OVERLOAD!!!!!! [DLC] this game has a huge range of DLC For it which are reasonably priced for all items you get from DLC Its worth what you spent and more! I hope player out there who read this review have the same experiance or better then me in this game! honestly it was an amazing game Thank you very much If you actually red all of my review it means a lot and I'd like to say a huge thanks to every1 who made this game!

The story doesn't pick up until Killbane comes into play and is sort of like a minor RPG with boss levels/missions.   SRTT has a level mechanic that happens through respect. As you progress, you can unlock skill optinos that give you unlimited ammo, grenades, stamina, and health. You can unlock the ability by reaching the desired level and paying the amount that is required.  There is an online profile on  saintsrow.com/steelport/stats  that can tell you how many people you've killed, the percentage of completion rate for the game, and other stats.",

The first reason being that I had a massive backlog, and the second was that it was completely unplayable on my rig (no, not that type of unplayable, fix far below!).  I've played so many GTA's from the very first top down, to London and III to Vice City, you name them all, I've played them (except for V, still to come to PC!), yet honestly Saints Row just can't be compared (even though some people like to do it all the time). Sure, it's an open world. Sure there are cops, you can kill them, and get chased, just like with gangs. Sure there are linear and non-linear missions with cutscenes, but what other sandbox out there doesn't have some or all of that already?  What makes Saints Row unique is that it is FUN! There's nothing serious, it's completely HILARIOUS and when I mean fun, I mean hitting people upside the head with a pink ♥♥♥♥♥! Shooting fish guts at your foes and watching sharks somehow defy all laws of what is possible (didn't get the DLC? SHAME ON YOU!), facegrinding people into the floor etc etc. And that is where Saints Row stands out; It's humor is unheard of in almost 90% of all the games I've ever played, it's fun to play, the missions don't feel repetitive, there's tons of customizations, hell, the cars alone and the ability to customize them totally bring back the good old days of Need For Speed: Underground, and let's not mention all the gun customizations that ACTUALLY change the look of your weapon (not just add +x damage!).  Take your favorite picks from all the games you've played and you're pretty much gonna end up with a perfect and well polished game, and aside from the early hassle with getting the game to work (and poor optimization on some machines) that is exactly what Saints Row: The Third is; a perfect game. My only woe is that the game, after playing GTA IV, is so short! :(  For those of you who were getting the damn CTD straight on the menu or loading up a new campaign, try the following, it was the only thing out of all the fixes out there that worked for me;  Reinstall the DirectX that comes with the game, inside the game folder, and run vcredist_x86.exe (found in the root of the games directory) and repair your previous install. After that, set the compatability on the game_launcher.exe, SaintsRowTheThird.exe and SaintsRowTheThird_DX11.exe to Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) and tick the 'Run this program as an administrator' box.",

The city feels a bit empty and there isn't a whole lot to do aside from buying buildings and finding packages. It misses something and I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it's because of the trailers, which showed already pretty much everything you can do in this game.  Yes, there are a lot of customization options (respect !), and yes, there are some nice (but repetitive) sidemissions, but that's it. In the end I was glad this game was over and I don't think that's what Volition would've wanted with this game. I do have to say I did enjoy the wrestling mission. That mission was spot on (including hilarious announcers). Now, it IS fun people, but only in small doses. Maybe my expectations were set too high, but still; see it as a friendly heads-up.

            "review_text": "This is Saints Row The Third, a game where you can kill everyone you see just for funzies with a giant purple ♥♥♥♥, but, you know, won't let you see 'real, actual' genitals. Or Boobs because there's no place for them in the Ethical Reality Climax that is Saints Row.  Saints Row: The Third has become my favorite game, surpassing Harvest Moon 64 within fifteen minutes of playtime. Not only that, but it's the one that really made games fun again. No, not fun,  magical . I haven't been so shamelessly addicted to a game since Pokemon Red and Blue.  SR3 is just fun. You will drive a tiger around town to build courage. You will kill hundreds and hundreds of mascots. You will ruin so many people's day in a tank. You will actually be able to pilot a helicopter for more than fifteen seconds before losing control and plowing into a building. You will take part in the greatest gameshow ever conceived that needs to be picked up by Fox and aired on Thursday nights right now.  When we last left the Saints, they had defeated the Ultor Corporation, and from the look of things pretty much took it over and went nuts with all that money. But being so successful naturally attracts all manner of a-holes who want to come and ruin your day, which is how SR3 starts off.  Robbing the wrong bank in Stilwater results in the Saints meeting the new bad guy, Phillipe Loren. Loren informs the Saints he'll be taking 66% of their of all future pre-tax earnings, or they'll all die. This doesn't quite work out the way Loren planned, and the Saints go to war with the Syndicate in their home turf of Steelport.  Steelport is a much more interesting city than Stilwater was. It feels much more natural than Stilwater did; it doesn't have that 'here's the poor part of town, here's where the rich people are,' vibe. Everything meshes together and feels like a city that has grown over time without being completely planned and 'themed' out.  The game itself works almost the same as Saint's Row 2, in that you have various locations on the map for real estate, activities, story missions, safe houses, etc. Not a whole lot has really changed in these aspects, but now activities all have their own individual locations. No spamming the enter key after completing each level to power through. Also: no Sceptic Avenger. Fudge.  When you get down to it, SR3's story is pretty much the same as SR2's (I never played SR1, but I'll bet it's the about the same). You start with nothing, and end up with everything. Your little meeting with Loren has left you stranded in Steelport with nothing but the clothes on your back and the money in your wallet (which is enough to supply an attack on a National Guard base, so I guess you're not that bad off).  After getting established in Steelport, you begin to target each individual gang as you attempt to take out the Syndicate. This time around you’re against the Deckers, the Luchadores, and the Morning Star. Each are pretty much carbon copies of the gangs from SR2 with a little stylistic difference. While you’re fighting those gangs, the government steps in and sends in the high-tech anti-gang unit STAG, with their lasers. And battleships. And hover bikes.  The gameplay has been refined since SR2. Right clicking lets you aim now, and you're able to attack and hijack cars while sprinting. Vehicles aren't as sensitive to input as they were in SR2, making it possible to slide around corners instead of just loudly changing direction. Helicopters aren't crap anymore and are useable. All-in-all SR3 is a big improvement over SR2.  The most important thing compared to SR2 is SR3 never crashed once in ~50 hours of play, and I only ran into two glitches: I got stuck driving a tiger around town with no end to the activity, resulting in an alt-f4 and a motorcycle got stuck in an electrical tower after a hilarious accident. No other problems, which is weird, because games like this always have wonky happenings.  Saints Row: The Third has a stupid subtitle but is an all-around amazing game. I won't even pretend to care about all the stuff I put off while I played it. It's that fun. Buy the pack with all the DLC. Don’t even wait for a sale. Just buy it. Buy two and co-op with a friend.",

The game took me about 60 hours to complete. + Wide selection of weapons to use in-game, including rifles, explosives, submachineguns, pistols and shotguns.  + Ability to customise your character with different voices, taunts and appearance prior to game commencement.  Negatives:  - Story is meh, moves away from the traditional gangster theme seen in Saints Row 2. It's a bit whacky in its approach. Saints Row: The Third is not a serious game. Some people will like this, others won't. Personally I didn't like it. - While there are many optional activities to partake in, most of these are repetitive and are exactly the same as the tasks given in Saints Row 2. No variety here...lazy development. Considering these activities are designed to soak up a core amount of gameplay time, it really does impact on the quality of the title.  Overall Score: 7/10  Saints Row: The Third is a fun game with plenty to accomplish. It's a shame the side activities we're given aren't fresh and exciting though, I really felt this let the game down. The plotline is very average and questionable, but otherwise a reasonably solid game. Worth purchasing on sale.",

Steelport is a bustling major 'Murican city with lots of opportunity for a go-getting gangleader such as yourself. But Steelport is run by an group of gangs all united under one man. This is where your expertise in taking gangs apart comes in handy. Sure, you didn't always make the best choices but those life choices built your character!  Your hard-working ethic is going to be put to the test. But it will be no less fun than it has been before, just... different.  But your actions have gained not only fame from your fans but infamy from many as well. A storm is brewing on the horizon. So you can seize the opportunity, set out what you came to Steelport to do... or you can become something more.",

You can drive almost every cars, planes, bikes etc. For completing missions you get cash and respect. Cash is required to buy upgrades unlocked by earning respect. At the end of the game you may become a god because if you bought 'damage' upgrades you wolud become immortal. SR 3 IS A MUST HAVE GAME. In my opinion it is one of the best games in 2011.
