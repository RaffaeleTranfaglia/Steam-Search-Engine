I totally recomend to play with a good headphones and put the volume to high. Then you can take a good relaxing cup of tea because your heart will be over 120 bpms. Not recomended for cardiacs!  Congrats to the team for making this game. I really enjoyed the experience and hope to see another from your team!        ",

It's a pretty decent and very unique gaming experience, but I'm not sure if i can truely give a recommendation to buy this game. If you are open for an unique and interesting 'puzzle' game, this is it. But I can't say it is worth the 7€ i paid. As it felt more like a school project. I'm not saying this is a bad 'game', but i didnt feel really it was worth my time and money. If there was 'more' to go on, about the story or what it exactly meant... I still give it a 7/10 for its unique experience.",

            "review_text": "This is basically the Inception of video games. So complicated and weird that your initial response is to think it must be good, because ultimately it's too weird for you to figure out. So we pretend we understand, and that we all like it, in an attempt to appear intelligent. The truth, though, is that the game is empty of meaning; that it just avoids having any substance in favor of confusing you so much that you think it does have something to it. It really, really, doesn't. There's going to be discussion of this game the same way there was discussion of Inception, people arguing about wha ♥♥♥ meant, and what the ending actually is. It's not really anything. I will say the puzzles were superb, but all of the buildup with plot and atmosphere were meaningless, in the end. If you like puzzles, go for it, but if you'll get invested in trying ot figure out what's going on, take a pass on this one.",

Some puzzles were super easy and others where hard. I only had to look up the third puzzle because I realy didnt understand the game mechanics but kudos to the devs for making such a unique game, if youre looking for something new and different try this game, if your a boring in the box thinking person then its not for you and you will get fustrated. Id love for horror games in the fututre to start bending the ppuzzles to other aspects of my pc. Imagine a game that made a file you had to read on your program files, imagine a game that sent you emails in order to continue. This is the directions that new devs should take note on to make an experiance more immersive ",

It's difficult to put into either the category ' recommend ' or ' do not recommend '. I think it's somewhere in the middle. It is a short game that does some cool experimental puzzles and tries to surround you in a dark atmosphere. But   the atmosphere was lost for me quite fast. And the game 'restarted' so often that I didn't even care after some puzzles.   And oh boy, the ending ... I won't say anything about that. In hopes that you will accept it more than I did.   I was just saying out loud 'This can not be the ending, there has to be more.'    To finish this rambling off, I will say that the game CALENDULA had some nice ideas and is worth a look when you are hungry for meta games. If you don't have a lot of money to throw at short games then feel free to wait for a sale.",

What's really clever is the way that the developers were able to create a viable adventure based solely around configuration menus. I don't know about any of you, but some of my first few minutes (if not hours) with a video game I've purchased online, are spent adjusting my settings in order to get everything fine tuned to my liking. This game built upon that compulsion and added a goal and a story... honestly, I'm just flat impressed.   From sound to presentation, you're not going to be disappointed. Definitely worth the buy.",

I got hung up in the eyeroom but Alt-F4ing and reopening it fixed it.   Over all the concept was solid. I really enjoyed the game and its subtle unerving atmosphere. The puzzles were interesting but not hard which was a nice touch. I beat it in about two hours.   My main gripe is the plot which ends, in my opinion, in a way that feels way too cliche. I won't spoil it but, as your going through, if you've played other indie games out there, you're more than likely going to figure out how it ends pretty quickly.   6-7/ 10 Is what I say. Great idea, concept, and excecution with pretty cool sound design to boot. The main problem being the story, which, unfortunatly in a game like this, seems a bit weak.",

It's certainly far more different compared to other games out there, and is certainly all the more interesting for it.  Compared to gems like Pony Island, however, Calendula ultimately comes across as a shallow experience, meant to be had once. It's not a long game either, with most achievements taken in within an hour or 2.  Its biggest failing, though, is that it could've been something good, but ultimately settles for mediocrity, namely with going for a theme that is beaten to the ground, compared to its opening premise, which easily showcases the best parts of the themes it runs with. A pity, then, that it decides to discard those in favor of something more cheap, that seems profound, but ultimately isn't.  Puzzles are fairly straightforward, with the exception of one particularly obnoxious puzzle. Though even that one can be solved with some patience.  Overall? A 5.5/10 from me.  P.S. That soundtrack is amazing.",
