            "review_text": "I grew up playing Total Annihilation back in 1998 and i still find myself still hopping back on every now and then. Supreme Commander 1 was a true successor to my beloved TA, and it still is. I found a new love. A year or 2 later, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance came out, which in my opinion is the definitive edition. The scale of Supreme Commander 1 is grand. I'm a huge RTS fan and supreme commander 1 has to by my number 1 favorite RTS game of all time, aside from its predecessor Total Annihilation of course. These 2 games have taken away a good portion of my life.  Now on to Supreme Commander 2..... ummmm..... I'm heartbroken. I've forced myself to play it a few times but i honestly just cant take it. Its horrible. SupCom2 does not have the same gameplay as SupCom1. The scale of SupCom 2 is too dumbed down. There is no sense of grand scale in this game. The maps are unsatisfyingly too small. The unit cap is also extremely low. And the unit designs are crap. This game is just sad and ruins the Supreme Commander name  For those of you who have never played SupCom1, then you might think that this is a good/decent game. I dont blame you.  As a fan of Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander, please hear me out...  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! (I mean you can if you want. I'll just pity you). Go Purchase SUPREME COMMANDER: FORGED ALLIANCE!",

            "review_text": "As a fan of the original Total Annihilation series I liked what the old Cave Dog group did, Supreme Commander and Forged Alliance were good enough, but Sup Com 2 does not do the franchise justice at all. It is a very dumbed down version which replaces many of the original’s mechanics with research grinding rather then building up bases and getting more advanced units. Basic units are just that, basic they are very boring and very small versus the levels and other units, while you can upgrade them with various research items to make them more effective it does a very poor job at replacing the 3+1 unit tier levels from the previous games. With this game now more then ever you rely heavily on the experimental units rather then building up a force of mixed units of various tiers with maybe one or two X units in the mix.  The main campaign does a good enough job at some kind of a story and MOST of the missions are gradual in their difficulty and challenge. However that difficulty spikes abnormally high when you reach the final 4 to 6 missions of the Cybran and you will fail multiple times before you figure out what the developers wanted you to do.   The skirmish AI and the AI in general tends to cheat and does so pretty obviously, getting clear stat, research speed, mass and energy boasts right off the bat, even on normal difficulty, which is a shame because I always enjoyed the TA/SC skirmish games.   I had shied away from buying this game when it came out after hearing reviews that it was a very basic and stripped version designed for mostly console play so I avoided it until 2013’s Christmas sale. I am glad I did because as much as I really wanted enjoy this game and get just as much play out of it as I did with Sup Com/FA and Total Annihilation it would seem that that is not the case. This will be one of the few games that I have purchased that will not last long on my hard drive, possibly to make room for something more worth while.  If you really want to continue to the story of Sup Com and FA, then by all means buy it when it’s on sale again, but do NOT buy this if you were a fan of TA or SC/FA. This honestly makes me worry about what Planetary Annihilation will be like which I hope will not be the case.",

Experimentals aren't, unit variety is slashed, nukes are like hand grenades, there are interface regressions everywhere.  Oh, and this is just multiplayer. We thought some variety might at least be enough of a welcome novelty from FA games to overlook its flaws, but it just isn't. The singleplayer, meanwhile, is absolutely godawful, with writing that would embarrass a direct-to-TV disaster movie.  It doesn't matter how cheap it is in a sale, this isn't of the TA lineage in any meaningful way, and Squeenix do not deserve your wallet change for ripping the heart out of the game and feeding it to the Zerg.",

Pros: -Some cool experimental units -Some good art design -The level design is engaging -Characters are more fleshed out compared to previous ones  Cons: -Everything has been dumbed down -Economy has completely changed from the SC exp: can't spend energy and mass at a deficit -Interface is worse than SC:FA -Gone are the grand battles involving 250+ units -Much smaller scale than SC:FA -Tier system is gone and replaced with research -Unit variety -Maps don't come close to the size of a 64x64 SC:FA map -Cybran ACU looks awful  GPG Changed most of what made the previous SC games so great. The complexity and scale are defining characteristics of the series. Lacking these characteristics, the game falls flat. If a Supcom 3 is ever made it needs to go back to Supcom 1 and FA for influence not Supcom 2. I don't recommend this game if you are a fan of SC: FA. IF you haven't played SC:FA you need to forget this game and get go get SC:FA",

The game is simple and that makes it interesting, everything is flat and rather straightforward but it works.  It suffers from all the flaws the original has. Poor AI, when you can get experimentals .. spam the crap out of them, missions that are only difficult (if at all) for the first 10-ish minutes, etc. However the game plays quite nicelly, it has cheating AI's in skirmish/MP and because of the 'flatness' you do not have to reserve 2+ hours to take down a cheating AI in skirmish or do a single campaign mission. Compared to the original, with 5 (or 6?) mission, it actually has 15 though. That does offer some more variaty in the missions but the overall time you spend on the campaign wont be much longer than you spend doing the campaign in the original.",

First off SC2 was a trade off in scale to be able to run on the xbox 360 (which is actually a good game if your looking for a good strategy for your console). But it still has more scale than many other popular RTS games. The game is far less unit managament and less unit upgrade focused. You basically pick your attack path at the beginning and off you go, changing from your direction in the game is a bit hard to pull off but with a good teammate it can be done. The game has great graphics, but unfortunetly it can't take advantage of our awesome new multi-core CPU's we have today, infact it really only uses 1 core and about 20% of a 2nd if you have it, for example the game ran as fast on my 4.2ghz pentium 4 extreme edition as it did on my Q6600 when I got the game years ago. Gas Powered games is gone now, but just before they were bought up they released a new AI patch which really helped with a lot of the stupidy the AI had, the AI was already challenging but i quickly found a lot of tactics no longer worked against certain levels of enemies. Faction balance is terrible in the standard game, imo of course, but once you add the DLC the game gets a whole new persective, every faction can now push there attacks in all 4 major ways (naval, air, land, artillery) except Aion who have no artillery. At the current price point you would be a fool to not pick up the game and the DLC they are completly worth it. Single player I still need to finish, I have always been terrible about finishing single player in RTS games though :) If your playing a large multiplayer match or want to get into multiplayer make sure to get some friends going(you use steam to invite into games), and make sure who ever has the most powerful system hosts the game.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: I'll put the tldr segment first because of the way they format the text: Supreme Commander 2 is a basic RTS that did not hold on to what it had in the first two games of the franchise. If you have not played the first games and are just looking for a nice looking RTS, then this is your game.   I have played Supreme Commander since the original was released back in 2007, I loved that game and it brought many new features to the RTS scene that have now become pretty much standard (ex: “strategic zoom”). After the pretty much utter failure of Forged Alliance, I was pretty surprised to see a sequel to a game whose first installment was pretty good, but had lost grasp on its fans by making a spin off and releasing it as a full game at full price when it really should have been an expansion or DLC. The First two games: Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, were both produced by THQ, developed by Gas Powered Games and to quote from the boxes “An Arts From [designed by] Christ Taylor”. These games had many mechanics that separated from other RTSs that were out that the time. The games had a focus on large unit management (I’m talking 1000+ units, none of that 200 max unit stuff you see in other games) to dominate the battlefield, players also had to use the terrain to their advantage to flank their enemies.   The resource management system that was in place in the first titles was also very different from other games at the time. Instead of having a set amount of resource in your position and you’re only able to build units with that set amount (if that makes any sense), SC and SCFA both had a resource rate system. This system would allow you to build as many units as you wanted, just production would slow down if you did not have a high enough rates of resources coming in, creating some pretty interesting situations when you realize that one of you Mass Extractors had been removed and you wonder why you’re not building as fast.   Units in the first two games were handled by a tier system. When you could afford to spend some time and had some extra resource coming in you could choose to upgrade up to two higher (because you start on tier one) tiers unlocking new units and engineers to build. When you obtain enough tier three engineers (for sake of practicality) you could build some pretty power game ender units called Experimental Units. These beasts included things such as a mobile factory that could build almost anything almost instantly and was pretty much indestructible, to gigantic humanoid robots that would shoot laser beams from their eyes. You could also build a unit called a Support Command Units, which were smaller less functional versions of the main Armored Command Units (which is what you play as), pretty much they make great suicidal units.   Now enough about the first to games in the franchise, let’s talk about Supreme Commander 2 (the third game of the series). You may be wondering why I spent all that time talking about the first games in the series; well it’s because they changed all that (well most of it). Publication of Supreme Commander 2 was transferred over to Square Enix, but was still developed by Gas Powered Games. The seconded game had more of a focus on small group combat rather than large scale unit combat like in the first game. The map design was also drastically different with even more of a requirement on terrain use. This wasn’t really a bad thing; the new maps were interesting and helped to balance the support between each kind of unit (land, air, sea). However one of the biggest flaws with in the game was with the units. They scrapped the tier system that was present in the first game for tech tree system. Gone are the days were you could build cheap factories that would pump out meat shields and cheap scouts. With this new tree system the placed in a resource, research points, along with the original two, Mass, and Energy. These points could be farmed or gained just from passing time, and then spent in the tree. Now some of these upgrades are pretty interesting, you can detach the control module of the AUC to make a quick escape and then make a bad-♥♥♥ comeback; but still the heavy focus on the system felt to simplify what made the first games unique and challenging; now all your factories have access two those high power units, and you no longer have to micromanage them. But by far the worst change that they made was to the resource system. They went from an “interest” based income system as I described before, to the standard “bank” system that is present in other RTSs such as Star Craft. This hurt the game, slowing the pacing down from all out action which made the first game amazing fun, to a waiting game to see who can farm the most and get Experimental Units first.   In the end Supreme Commander 2 is a decent strategy game, but that’s all it is. GPG did not stick to what made the first two games so different, high pacing action with ridiculous unit counts and lots of explosions. The maps are interesting enough to keep games exciting for the first few rounds, and the visuals are fantastic even for a three year old game. However I still can’t help but feel hurt that this cult favorite that really was the benchmark for RTSs (both visually and mechanically) at the time it was released has been watered down to please a wider demographic. Also I feel that I should note that it was released a few weeks before Star Craft 2 so that didn’t help with sales. In all I would recommend the first two games over this one: Supreme Commander, and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, if you want a unique RTS experience and don’t already own them. If you want a beautiful RTS with unique units but really basic mechanics then go right ahead and pick up Supreme Commander 2.",

Now, in a DLC, you can get an experimental shield generator, but that's the DLC, and Im not talking about the DLC, Im talking about the game. Another issue I have with this, is the border markers, PDs range, shields range, etc. Its a thick ring, that doesnt give you a very precise-feeling measurement. I much prefer Supreme Commander's thin ring, it feels so much better. Also, they obliterated some of my favorite experimentals, namely the FatBoy. That thing was a beast, heavy shield gen, long range cannons, unit production capabilities. Now its just a big bloody tank. I love this game.

Instead of providing options to manage base building on the fly you are required to bounce back and forth with your units. Couple that with an AI that can do that on the fly, makes this very frustrating. Unit building is slow and you cant tell if something is building or not, the contruction should be individual to each building unit and not ordered by unit, so it makes unit construction slow and painful since most times when i should be seeing a massive group of units waiting for me to select, instead all i see is one and the next one is in a queue waiting because the unit from a different pool is currently be produced and this is on top of a possitive resource system with excess resources waiting. This is on top of the typical AI crap that is in every game, the AI will always have available the exact unit to counter my units and have almost immediate access to replacement units.

The game is generally ♥♥♥♥ so why do I find myself enjoying it? Oh that's right.   Veterans of RTS want to introduce new friends into the RTS genre to have more people to play with. But if you're not already a fan of RTS type games being thrown into SCFA (Supreme Commander Forged Alliance) Is overwhelming and you'll likely uninstall the game shortly after out of frustration. So anyone who by default does not have the brain injury required to enjoy RTS games should buy this one first. SC2 is babys first RTS which I said earlier. It's used to get new RTS players into the scene because if you stuck them into a real RTS they would fall down on their face and cry.   TL:DR If you like RTS games go buy Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. If you want a friend/girlfriend/boyfriend to get INTO rts games then buy them this play it with them until they're good then buy them SCFA so you never have to play this disgusting excuse for a SC game ever again.",

(and if you like it, look up the older supcom1/FA and give those a spin)  The research system is a nice deviation from previous strategy games, it reminds of a system used in C&amp;C generals although much more options.   Overall, the game runs smooth, the campaign story is quite decent.   However, there is just one thing really wrong with this game.  Resource management and build queues don't line up good. You are unaware if you have resource-issues. The resource management claims you have a postive flow of resources, while your builders are waiting in queue to build something. That should somehow be visible.  (on the bright side, I know understand why StarCraft has a limited build queue :) This problem is not a game-breaker per se, however, it can be a frustrating point from time to time.

For example, build queues beyond your current resources (the ability to plan ahead) are gone. Units have been simplified and unit numbers reduced. The overall game has taken on the per-game-leveling mechanics as those seen in the Battle for Middle-earth II and Command and Conquer: Generals RTS games. Map sizes have been greatly reduced and the graphics are terrible: the units look like fisher price toys.  Basically, if you've never played the series, this game will be overly difficult to learn for what you get back from it and if you're a huge fan, like me, you'll absolutely hate the changes they've made.

Be warned, however, hardcore fans of the first Supreme Commander will find a completely different experience much less focused on the city building and micromanagement side of RTS and geared more towards how well players can manage easily obtained resources to build massive armies. This as a result has led to the second major issue with this game; a minuscule and virtually non-existent online community. Online multiplayer in Supreme Commander 2 is one of the best RTS experiences that can be had but you will find very few games, most of which populated by very good players.

            "review_text": "It's really simple. If you've played/own SC1 and/or FA, this game will probably disappoint you. In general, lots of options have been taken out which were present in the predecessors, including diversity and lots of tactical features, especially the latter being very important aspect of RTS genre.  However, this has been happening with most of (RTS, but also others as well) games recently. This game fits into this new category of 'next-gen' games. The UI and Graphics have been updated (although in SC2 it isn't as fake flashy as in other new games), so it appeals to new and probably young players (who otherwise lose their attention if they aren't surprised in the first few seconds of seeing a new game, and the very first thing you see in a game is how it looks like). Also, it has been simplified a lot (or, I think it was both partly, it wasn't really finished yet), but that again can have its positive effects, like new players get into it faster and you can convince friends to play it easier.  So for situations where you've got some time for a long battle, together with other RTS-dedicated friends, SC1 and FA fits better. However, especially if you haven't (yet) played the previous ones in the series, this game can really be awesome and fun to play. The largest maps in the game, while far from the size of SC1's and FA's 81x81km games where you really wish you had some Homeworld hyperspace modules, they still give some lengthy plays and tactical options. The smaller maps are good for quick plays, when you don't have that much time. You've still got control of exlusions of what can't be built in Skirmish/MP and the game can be modded quite easily (although not many mods are made), so for some casual battles you can change things slightly (like I find it relaxing to sometimes play without nukes and/or air units). Also, some mods are actually quite good, and some bring back some SC1/FA features.  So to conclude, if you want lots of tactics, slow(er) gameplay, grand scale and planning, you'll probably like SC1 and FA better. However, if you want some quick matches, easier play/calmer learning curve, or want some friends to join you quickly who might not be into RTS games that much, SC2 is a quite nice game to play. I'd certainly recommend buying it in a sale, it really is worth the price when it's reduced like that. Oh, and don't forget to buy the Infinite War DLC, it is a must for the game!",

You can't have engineers/ACU assist in the building of anything. 3. You can't even start to build something unless you have 100% of the resources in your stockpile (If I want to play StarCraft, I will go play StarCraft). Chris Taylor's RTS games used to stand out, in that, you could start to build something as your resources came in. Not so in this one. 4. Units/structures are not tech upgradable like in SupCom and FA. Instead, teching up forces you to use an abitrary and very clunky tech tree making the game more about earning tech points than trying to strategically and tactically upgrade when possible. (If I want to play Civ, I will just go and play Civ).  All in all, the is one of the worst RTS games I have ever played which is a shame because I am normally in awe of Chris Taylor's RTS's.

Tiny maps and utter defacing of factions has pulled the heart and soul out of it for me. That said, it does have some appealing features.  Pros: - The tech tree is a nice touch. Forcing commanders to favour certain tactics because of technological limitations adds a new edge to the game that its older brothers lacked. - The commander now feels alike a COMMANDER! More tools and tricks help to really make you feel like you are a presence on the battle field. I especialy like the 'escape pod' feature for getting out of a squeeze and for pure opponent frustration! - I really loved the DLC - Great to bring the infamous Spider Monkey back out and onto the field!   Cons: - The scale of the maps has been reduced massively, making the battlefields feel comparatively tiny. - The units have gone from chatoic and fun to just plain childish (Cybranasaurus?! Its like Jurassic World in here!) And what on earth is going on with the giant Aeon snail? - What happened to the silver fleet of the Aeon?! The massive unstoppable tide of the old world has been replaced with a fleet of cruddy hovercraft! Navel warfare just doesnt play like it used to :( - Whilst alot of the new units are really good, they look like they have been coloured in by a four year old. Pastoral and pastey.
