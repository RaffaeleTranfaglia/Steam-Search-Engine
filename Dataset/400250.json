    "description": "More a Journey in your Inner Self than a game, &quot;Heaven Island&quot; is an experience in which you'll explore wonderful places. The inspiration for the environments comes from the Renzo Piano designs and from the book &quot;Origins of Architectural Pleasure&quot; in which the welfare is of primary importance.",

The good is: You can do all achievements and you can do it fast. You can run faster with shift. The graphics not bad but not good. The game is cheap and if you wait for a good deal you can get it cheaper. And you can get a lot of trading cards.",

Ehh, maybe in a circa-2010 game engine kind of way, certainly nothing more than what you see in the images. Is it tranquil? Interesting? Getting there. What it needs is more of these pages, with more text, and the ability to actually sit, or perhaps to fly, but most importantly considering it installs itself as an 'MMO', it needs the ability to interact with other players beyond just seeing them.

Now after the little i've played this game, it dosen't seem to offer much, without the exploration, even that needs a bit more to it if thats the point of the game.  I'm a bit curious what the developer intends to make this game into &amp; where its headed in the future. I do like the scenery in games, but often it should have some more elements to it than just the exploration.  Ill be reviewing this game as a fully launched game as it isn't marked as Early Access!   ------------------------------------------------    Pros:",

            "review_text": "I'm going to give this a thumbs up for now simply because I read the info around the game before playing and have a clear exectation of what the game currently has available. First off, it's classified as an MMO but currently you see other blue 'souls'/orbs in the game but there is no interaction in the game really. You are a blue orb that floats around the environment and so far I've found there are books that have quotes from Tom Stoppard, Martin Luther King Jr., and maybe some Zen type quotes/thoughts.   I chatted with the lead developer and he has more plans to add stuff, maybe crafting, etc. but for now you can only pick up some items like shells and apples, etc. There currently appears to be no inventory access however. It is really a cool environment and the music isn't too bad. It honestly reminds me of Hawaii, calm, serene, and peaceful.   Because I knew the current state and that the dev is adding more features and functionality in the future I will give this a 7/10 for what my current expectations were. You may find yourself wanting to find all the key locations and may sink a lot of time in just moving around the island.  Pros: Serene, calm environment with music and sounds to relax. You can 'collect' shells, read books that are on the paths (and do like I did and google/research where they came from), see the 'sites', get caught up in wanting to 'just find one more place and see what's 'over there'. Graphics are pretty cool, shadows are neat, fish and environment are pretty good.  Cons: Had a few graphics crashes on a really high end video card/gaming system. Had to reduce to 'fast' instead of 'fastest' for graphics. Need inventory access, maybe crafting. You have to start back at the same spot every time you log in, not where you left off. I got stuck trying to go into a few of the treehouses/shacks. No chat or interactions with others.   If you are looking for a highly interactive game this is not it (yet). If you are looking for a lot of interaction, crafting, inventory, etc. this is not it (yet). If you like those games that kind of catch you and draw you in to keep going and trying to just see what's around the next corner, while being calming and relaxing, this is the game you want. If you like researching then things you find in game this is also a good thing for you to experience in this game.  ",

            "review_text": "  I got this game for free, and I can safely say it was worth every penny I paid for it. I've tried to break it down into a pro/con list.  PROS: +Good graphics - Not the best, but they're decent enough. +High FPS - Runs pretty well, even on high settings. +Huge map - There's lots of places to explore. +Simple to understand - It's not complicated at all.  Unfortunately, this is the extent of the positive things I can say about this. Graphics and performance can only get you so far.  CONS: -No story - You're given no story or explanation as to why you're here and what you're supposed to do. If I hadn't read the achievements before playing the game, I wouldn't have had a clue what I was meant to do. All that you're given are a few books with cryptic quotes about happiness in them. -Lack of objective - The only task you're given in this game is to collect seashells and apples. There's no real reason behind it and it doesn't feel meaningful in any way. It's not at all fun and gets very boring after about 5 minutes. -World is too big - There are all sorts of structures on and around the island, but they're often blocked off by invisible walls and there's sadly no incentive to explore them at all. Instead, you're encouraged to stick close to the water and trees so you can get apples and shells. This wouldn't be so bad if the island wasn't HUGE. It takes ages to navigate the whole thing looking for tiny little objects. -Glitchy - I encountered lots of bugs and graphical glitches in this game. One time when I booted it up, the map completely failed to load and I was just stuck in a void. Another time, I got stuck in some rocks underwater. It's frankly shameful. -Bad controls - The mouse sensitivity is very high and the controls aren't very intuitive. To collect objects, you press the E key instead of the mouse like a sensible person would expect. You can't really tell where your cursor is because there's no crosshair and you need to have your mouse over an object to collect it. There's no way of changing the controls or editing the mouse sensitivity because when you press escape, the game just closes. -Easy - You can complete this game in 30 minutes-an hour very easily. There's no challenge involved at all.    This game is hardly even a game. It's the kind of thing you would expect in a tech demo, not a full game that costs 99 cents. Don't waste money and disk space on this!",
