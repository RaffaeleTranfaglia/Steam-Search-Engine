The world and object design is above par and deserves a better combat mechanic, at least with the archer you start of as.   If you got a kid that's just happy shotting at stuff that's hard to hit... we'll hopefully that's just a phase he'll grow out of soon.",

Add more feedback like a sound effect when I hit something. I hit a bull and visual feedback is not enough. Enemy should react with a noise, one for pain and another before an attack.  Music is great, but a great track does not make up for lack luster sound effects.   Yeah combat is painful and I understand other reviews. I'm not saying there has to be gore, but maybe some better animation or effects when I hit something would be nice.   Overall, this game has a light hearted feel, but it is not playable and feels incomplete or early access.",

            "review_text": "  I was gifted a copy of  Fairy Tales: Three Heroes  for review purposes by the Steam entity,  Epic Quest Games  or 'EQ Free Games.' It's so neat to see videogames based directly on a cultural history/mythology (Slavic). I once took a course on Russian folklore &amp; found some familiar elements here. Tragically, every other aspect of the game (aside from art) is a letdown.  Before now I'd never heard of  Cats Who Play  or any game they've developed. Probably won't go for more of their stuff until I see ample proof of their improvement with time &amp; experience - &amp; I'm speaking as a gamer with a wide-ranging appetite for indie creations. On paper the concept is great: three distinct heroes, an adventure &amp; a villain all inspired by Russian lore/history. Unique skills &amp; mechanics for each hero. Something was lost in transition from concept to game.  Clearly skills &amp; targeting don't work as well as they ought. Auto-aim penalties &amp; poor responsiveness in player controls render investment of points into certain skill trees a waste. The entire experience of player movement, jumping, strafing, pathfinding, etcetera is as clumsy as the combat. Nothing is intuitive; gameplay is at times painfully dreary.  Triggers for cutscenes &amp; events are occasionally misplaced, leading to events being out of sequence. It'd be hilarious if I weren't actually trying to finish the level. A few bugs caused crashes, or led to inconveniences like a missing mouse pointer or launch failure. This doesn't alt+tab well at all, either.  I played on Normal, given the choice of Easy, Normal or Hard. Doesn't matter all too much since combat is wonky; hitting enemies &amp; surviving battle depends as much on whatever's happening behind the scenes as on your input!  Localization in English is fairly poor. Grammar errors, laughably awkward voice acting, misspelled or entirely incorrect subtitles. It just took me out of the moment. The art style is quite pleasant - very bright &amp; colorful with clean lines. The music seems fine for a low budget indie; I'd say low to middling visual/audio production quality.  And yet after all this, I still found the will to play all the way through to the end. My first attempt wasn't great. I came back a few days later &amp; willed myself to finish the game in one full evening of play. Conceptually it isn't bad at all! The game's just rudimentary in so many ways that it is at no point a compelling experience. The single gratifying moment for me was seeing how Hero-specific mechanics were worked into completing an objective that utilized the folklore stuff. I won't spoil it.  I don't want to be too harsh in my review; I respect the effort that goes into creating even a small game. With design tweaks &amp; significant technical overhaul I'd happily play, on whichever platform. Unfortunately I can't currently recommend  Fairy Tales: Three Heroes . A shame, as I was curious at the outset to see what could be done with the folklore angle.",
