I picked up this game, and now i'm building more elaborate and thoughtful contraptions. Instead of using bombs and robots, I'm building elaborate contraptions with many steps-although the goal is the same. it's still fun as hell to blow unicorns up with gas barrels, make modified trebuchets, etc. A lot of fun all around, definately recommend!",

Deadlic won't update it or something...   DO NOT BUY!   ",
