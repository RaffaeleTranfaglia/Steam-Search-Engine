            "review_text": "I liked this game quite a bit! I've played through the second one as well (Assault). It's a run and gun, isometric alien shoot-em-up. It all takes place on ships infested and breaking apart. You kill aliens, repair and bypass things, explode stuff, and reek havoc in general. The gunplay feels really good because the aliens get knocked down and impacted by gunfire. This makes even the generic machine gun feel good to use because you can keep aliens at bay with its stopping power. I even played the second game occasionally with a controller and it felt pretty good (although I went back to kb/m because of the precision).  The story reads (literally) as a pulp sci-fi comic book, but it's interesting enough to frame the combat. This game makes killing aliens fun :)",

You maneuver through a series of 5 stages in each episode, collecting weapons and items, and shooting aliens as they appear while you move from objective to objective provided on your mini-map.  It is difficult to write a separate review for each Episode, as they all largely play the same - you move from point A to point B to pick up access code C to open door D to get to point E to get access code F to.....you get the picture. Lots of backtracking through same-looking corridors, fighting similar looking enemies which pop out of the floor and walls.  It's fun, but only moderately so - I would NOT recommend playing through a single episode in one sitting, let alone all three episodes. The gameplay is repetitive and it's the sort of thing you'll want to put down for a while between sessions (I'd actually say on the level of months between episodes) so it doesn't get stale.",

            "review_text": "A very decent twin-stick shooter. This game really does a lot of things right, but unfortunately falls just short of being a great game. Let's start off with the premise of this game. You are a battle hardened engineer (which I'm not sure those words go together) who is traveling on the massive ship, the Leopold. You've just come out of a warp jump and your ship slams into a gigantic vessel that dwarfs your own. Blah blah blah etc etc etc you can find out the rest in game, but the idea is basically having to go around and fix an enormous amount of problems that seem to never end on the Leopold, all while fighting off thousands of this never before seen alien species. Nothing too original for the plot, and when it comes to the aliens, obviously borrows a lot from the Alien movies (which is not a bad thing).  Now onto the game itself. We'll go ahead and start with what the game does great and that is the graphics and environment. The game looks phenomenal for it's price point and for when it was made. The unreal engine in use here really shows off it's stuff as every room and enemy is very, very detailed. Even the action itself looks downright awesome. It's hard to get tired of obliterating countless aliens whenever the guns look this amazing in action. Of particular note, the flamethrower looks incredible, and so do all of the fire physics. The environment differences between the Leopold and the alien vessel are also a drastic shift. While most of the electronics, doors, and corridors look the same (which raises a lot of questions), the alien vessel feels much more ancient and powerful than the Leopold just from the environmental shift.  After that though, the game does start to falter. The story is subpar throughout this first episode, but I will admit curiousity as to where that alien ship came from, and in general where those aliens came from. After reading the logs, they speak of genetic experimentation that the aliens obviously went through so that only raises more questions. At this time I'm halfway through the second game and very little more has been exposed. Other than that, the characters are flat and predictable including the main character. Any side characters besides MIA are quickly forgotten and seem to have no bearing on the game.   The gameplay itself is mildly entertaining. Most of the time you'll be navigating from one room to another to fix *enter ship system here* while gunning down a number of random aliens that are constantly trying to murder you. And....that's kind of the whole game. There really isn't much else to speak of. The guns are the generic AR, shotgun, flamethrower, pistol etc. The enemy variety is also on the bland side as most of them will charge you relentlessly no matter what. There's only one boss fight in the game and while slightly different from the normal gameplay, does nothing to change the status quo the game has already firmly set.  Overall, if you can get this game on sale (like it is currently), go for it. It's 5 hours of decent entertainment with maybe a few more hours stuffed in if you can find a co op partner. Just don't be looking for an incredible game with endless hours of fun in store, because it's simply not there.  Score - 6.5/10",

Obviously for that it would have to be changed to FP instead of top down. But I think it would work well. This reminded a lot of the old Doom and Wolfenstein games in that's it's simple yet fun. Pick up a gun, shoot some stuff, find out how to unlock the door and shoot some more stuff. Sometimes it's the simplicity that makes the games the best.

            "review_text": "I managed to get to the end of this game... but it took more than six months, even though you can actually beat the campaign in less than 5 hours. I just found it really hard to get myself to play this game, and I did it just because it was waiting for me there with the rest of the trilogy in my steam library, and I've already got enough backlog. But yeah, playing this game felt almost like a chore. It is definitely playable and I guess you may like it if you enjoy the 'hack and slash' genre but in my opinion this game gets boring very fast and everything you do within it feels completely meaningless. The writing is horrible, the plot, if you can call it that, could as well not be there at all.   I'll sum up this game quickly for you: Go there, kill all the aliens that pop up along the way, come back to the place where you started. Repeat again. And again...and again. 'Sorry, your princess/generator is in another castle/part of the ship, go back through the same parts of the ship you have already ran through about 10 times and then come back here again.' Urgh, there is a fix number of times a gamer can go through the same corridor before he/she decides to stop playing. Oh, and the main protagonist looks a lot like a less cool Riddick. Conrad? Yeah, right.  I'll probably eventually play Alien Breed 2, but I suspect it will be more of the same and it'll probably take me another 6 months... At least as long as it concerns the first one in the series, I'd say I don't recommend it unless you love shooting at great number of enemies in a game with no plot whatsoever in isometric view. If that's your thing, then go for it because this is your game. The two positive things I can recall from playing is that I think it's cool they muted almost all sounds while out in space, and also I think that using comics to tell the story is a valid strategy, specially for those games with no great budgets. Overall, however, this game is definitely a no.",

The whole 'campaign' is really dull and repetitive, consisting of the player running around doing chores for the computer-cyborg woman that you see briefly in the beginning cutscene.  So the story goes something like this: Your ship captain ♥♥♥♥ed up and rammed your ship into some colony/military/I dont ♥♥♥♥ing know space hulk that was swarming with aliens that kill everyone on your ship and continually try to eat you the whole time. Your character is this buffed out engineer that has the 'badass' voice about him and is supposed to be seen as a man that can get the job done with little to no words. However, he just comes out as someone that seems continually butthurt that he didnt get his latte for breakfast. He repairs the engine and shoots some aliens, he goes to hydroponics and shoots some aliens, and then he boards the big ♥♥♥ ship that you crashed into and shoots some aliens with bigger better guns. Game ends with the main character kinda face to face with the biggest alien he's ever seen and quite frankely looks like he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ his pants with a streched frown on his face while muttering the words, 'Gotta go' to the cyborg woman that is like, 'the ♥♥♥♥ is going on over there?'. Thats the game. 9 and a half hours of running around and shooting aliens while flippin switches.  Yep. Pretty bad. Get Alien SWARM though, that game is free and is wayyyyy more kickass than this thing",

I found this wasn't a very good game overall. Some elements were good but not enough to redeem it as a whole. Its a fast paced, isometric shooter in a futuristic sci-fi settings. You get a small selection of guns in which you use to kill aliens as you progress through one bland environment after another. The combat itself feels fairly solid even though some things like interacting with objects and movement feel clunky. Also, the story feels pretty tacked on to what is already a mediocre game.  Score: 5/10  (Maybe wait until the trilogy goes on sale for dirt cheap if you're looking to buy)",

The game does play well, but there is never anything of challenge. It's just shoot and use medpacks if you ever have to... you definitely don't. maybe on the hardest difficulty, but that would probably be because the aliens have too much health and they just kamikaze your face.
