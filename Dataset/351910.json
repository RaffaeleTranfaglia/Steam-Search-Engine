            "review_text": "Valhalla Hills will remind many older gamers of titles like The Settlers and Culture, which is the normal given that the development team that creates the new Viking driven experience had a hand in the creation of both those already classic titles.The entire game is built around optimization, with gamers asked to carefully control the movement of their characters and the location of their buildings to create communities that can thrive and exploit the environment around them. Valhalla Hills manages to walk a fine line between excessive complexity, which is always a temptation for the city-building genre, and a lack of variety and is suited both for long-term fans of the main mechanics and for those who discover them for the first time.  The narrative here is a pretty simple one, albeit quite funny and suitable for the temperamental gods of Norse mythology that inspired it: Odin’s in a pissy mood after his son Leko fails an “exam of the gods,” so he slams the door to Valhalla shut. Unable to rest their weary bones inside, the honorable Vikings are forced to turn to Leko — demoted to the unflattering position of “God of the Builders” — who will attempt to redeem himself by leading the heroes up the eponymous mountains. You can do this one of two ways: by opening the magic portals of Valhalla to fight the enemies within, or by appeasing the gods with tributes. And by building: doing tons and tons of building.  From the bright, cartoon landscapes to the roly poly design of the little villagers, Valhalla Hills doesn’t take itself too seriously, which is not to say the game is simplistic, shallow, or easy. In fact, there are a number of interconnected systems to monitor and master. Each level begins with a procedurally generated landmass and the player’s task is to build a thriving community that will eventually — either economically or militarily — unlock the magical portal and the bridge to Valhalla.  Like The Settlers, the player does not directly control the little Viking villagers, instead controlling where buildings are sited, the types of buildings, and the optimal paths between resources and structures. The population is autonomous and while the player may lay down a series of building sites, the workers will determine the build order. A good strategy is one that does not give the easily distracted villagers too many options.  While each level invariably requires an early build sequence that includes finding a source of raw materials and food, then crafting a workshop and tools, once the basics are established the choice becomes how to deal with the monsters or hostile warriors that spawn through or guard the portal to Valhalla. The military option requires building barracks and forging and upgrading weapons, which of course require advanced workshops and rarer materials. Less bellicose players may choose to build a series of temples to control and placate the enemy, but that path also requires an escalating series of constructions and upgrades. Both strategies are viable options and on the middle and later maps, both require a vibrant, well-managed economy.  Valhalla Hills has two basic modes: a “campaign” mode in which structures, upgrades, and game systems are introduced slowly, over a number of progressively larger maps; and an “open” mode in which all options are available from the start — as well as all monsters and other enemies. There isn’t much of a story beyond the opening cinematic that explains the premise, and while tooltips pop up every time a new structure or mechanic is introduced, neither is there a tutorial proper. Experienced players of The Settlers or other city builders can probably intuit a lot what they need to know, but it will take all players some trial and error and less than optimal results before the systems become clear.  Once you do get into the flow of this game however, you will truly be able to appreciate what it has going for it. The graphical quality, while simple, is smooth and refined, striking an unexpected balance between old-school sensibilities and modern-day sharpness. The maps are fully articulated, allowing you to move and zoom freely about their entirely and providing a hexagonal grid only when it’s appropriate, allowing a more consistent sense of immersion.  The music of Valhalla Hills is… alright. It’s soothing, adequately produced and thematically appropriate, but not memorable. Considering this title is mostly about magicing buildings into existence, large orchestral scores would’ve been strange, granted, but something a little more unique and stylish would have been nice during those times when I was hurrying up to wait.  On the point of action, there isn’t a great deal of it. Most of the fighting you will encounter is when your brave followers decide to press onward to through the next portal toward Odin’s side. At these times, and depending on how you play it, guardians may appear to challenge your vikings to prove their worth. These battles are mostly a test of your preparedness and foersight, not of your tactics or formation of units. Niko is a builder, not a fighter, and it’s at these moments that it shows the most.  This is honestly a very well built game and a pleasure to play. It’s not really all that complex or burdened with layers of technicalities of its own design. It feels inviting and wants you to have a good time poking around with your options in search discovering new features to add to your fun. But the lack of a strong tutorial system slides it to a farther end of the learning than I think the developers intended. You sort of need to have a strong grasp of RTS games like this one in order to feel confident any time soon, and that’s not the kind of thing a newcomer may want to put themselves through.  Other should-be-important details, such as how to accrue Honor, a type of passive meta-stat required by Odin for your vikings to be accepted into his kingdom, goes largely unexplained even after it becomes necessary. I cleared the first few maps being told how impressive my Honor score was with no idea what that meant, how to check it, or how I could do it again.  Valhalla Hills is all in all, a strong little RTS, with enough going on under the surface to satisfy most fans of the genre. Its style is fitting enough and the game endears itself to you and keeps you immersed. Valhalla Hills is a solid game that anyone who has ever played The Settlers will enjoy.",

            "review_text": "Please be aware - I've only played 6 hours of this so far, so take it as you will.  I so wanted to like this game. I played the Original Settlers back on the Amiga and it was my favourite game EVAR. I played all the later Settlers games and loved them all too. So when I saw this, I was over the moon.  However, I have not been at all grabbed by this game. There seems to be no point to it at all. No 'hurrah, I beat the level'. No particular difficulties to overcome or objectives to achieve. The only thing you seem to do is repeatedly fight your way through portals, with the nebulous overall goal of eventually (through building, fighting etc) getting each of your little dudes up to 100,000 honour points so that they can individually get into Valhalla.  I know we've seen 'Set up a town, go through a portal' before - but there were always challenges in they way of that. Here there seems to be no challenge, and it all just seems terribly...pointless.  I am wrestling with the decision of whether or not to refund this game, and I have NEVER refunded a game before, that is the measure of how disappointed I am.  For those that are interested - the graphics are ok, but sadly the music is dull and not in the slightest bit catchy. I still get the music from the original Settlers stuck in my head, complete with the sounds effects 20 years later. All I remember about the music from this is that I remember thinking 'this is dull'.",

            "review_text": " Valhalla Hills is a city builder game where you play Leko, son of Odin as he tries to regain his honour back in his fathers eyes by helping mortal Vikings to build, survive and become worthy enough to enter Valhalla.   The game starts with a wonderful little story about how Leko ends up banished from Valhalla as he displays signs of creativity and enjoys building and doesn't seem to care for the traditional fighting ways of the Vikings. Odin tells him to go to Earth and become the God of the Builders and not to return. Leko, however, decides he can win a place in Valhalla with his father if he can just regain enough honor.  Valhalla Hills is reminiscent of some of the old great city builder strategy games but with it's own nice little spin. Rather than having every building unlocked for you from the start, you have to unlock them over time by regaining honor which you do by completing missions or various objectives. You do have the option to play in 'Open Mode' which allows everything to be unlocked from the start but this is significantly harder and I would not recommend this for people just starting out. The classic mode has a nice difficulty curve and teaches you what you need to know as it goes on, explaining each building or new feature to you as you unlock it preventing you from missing out on what vital buildings do.  The gameplay is pretty easy to learn if you are familiar with these types of games. You are guided through the basics like how to build, building speed, managing resources and such and each time you unlock something new, build a building for the first time or there is a new event it is explained. There is also a nice colour grid to help with placement which speeds things up a lot. Despite saying this, if you are new to this genre you might struggle. Though there is a lot that is explained to you there is also a lot that is missed out. I've played this genre for a many years but ended up making two crucial errors early on which messed up two entire missions because something very simple wasn't explained. This can become a huge problem which I'll explain further in the cons.   Each mission starts you with a few Vikings, some resources to get you started and an end portal on your map and your goal is to reach and open the end portal either killing or appeasing the guardians on the way. Your Vikings can be assigned various roles but from there onwards they will handle their duties themselves with no extra input from you (most of the time). They have basic needs as well and will require things like food and sleep with some extra needs/perks like some booze for the soldiers to keep them happy and strong. Its your job to build these things to fulfil the needs of your mortals so you can conquer each map and bring yourself closer to going home.   There is a nice selection of buildings from what I've seen so far but I feel the shape and design of the map can limit how you place them. The maps start of fairly small meaning your first few 'villages' will look fairly similar because certain buildings have to be placed near others for them to work successfully.   Despite me enjoying myself a lot so far there are some cons I would like to mention because they are noticeable. The first is that the story starts very, very strong and I was excited to play through and see more about Leko's struggles but from what I've seen there is no more to the story. The missions themselves start with no further addition to the storyline and it seems that the opening cutscene is all there is to it. This is very disappointing because the start itself was very engaging. My second issue is the fact that if you build wrong, even one building, chances are it'll mess up your entire mission. Resources are very scarce and once you have used one up you are screwed. For example, the woodcutter has a certain range where he can fell trees and there are only a certain amount of trees dotted around the map, once he destroys those trees that building is useless and I'll have to build another using logs (which can only be made in a woodcutter). If I have no logs, like I did then I'll have to demolish a building to get some as it's the only way I found to get more. Except, I had other buildings I had placed to be built and you cannot control the build priority at all so they started building those using up all my logs again. In the end I had to restart because they had all started to starve because they couldn't build the bakery. This needs to be fixed.  You shouldn't require a basic material to build a building that can only be obtained from that building.  This forces you to build some things in a very specific order. My last gripe I think is directly related to my previous one. You have to create each tool you need yourself rather than it being automatically created if you have the resources. This becomes a very boring thing to do over and over again but I do believe this is in place because of how limited your resources are and to stop you using up everything making tools when you need buildings first.    Overall I think Valhalla Hills is a fun game with some great features though it's lacking in any story depth. I do feel that the $30 price is too high because of this but the game is 100% worth it if it goes on sale. Another great genre edition perfect for those who are familiar with but prefer a more relaxed take on the city builder strategy genre. ",
