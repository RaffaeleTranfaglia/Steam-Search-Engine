            "review_text": "In grand Popcap tradition, Zuma's Revenge is a simple game to learn, but exciting and satisfying to play and play and play. The premise has a line of multi-colored marbles inching their way along a pre-defined path towards an ultimate drop-dead point and you have to shoot similar colored marbles at the line in order to create matches of at least three marbles. Different bonuses will allow greater control over the advancing line, but the real progress comes from simply being dextrous enough to notice the matches and quickly fire accurately. The game is relatively stress free until the final levels when the game starts throwing interlocking looped paths which block your ability to manipulate the entire line and forcing you to act quick and precise to keep things managable. At certain points the game changes and you face off against different 'boss' characters which employ subtle variations to the game techniques. The experience prooves to be very satisfying and quite rewarding.",

It looks and sounds nice, but mechanics are basic, half of the power-ups are useless (and are rather rare overall) and level-design is extremely pedestrian. But worst of all last chapter is extremely unfair with last boss just spaming stun attacks while aim is deliberately off.",
