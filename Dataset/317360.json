See, the vindicator is like a saltshaker, it projects pellets of salt upon opposing victims who happen to get in the way of the holy trinity of all man-made weapons of mass destruction. Using this weapon is especially pleasant, when I happen to be playing as a nicolas cage looking guy, flopping around on the floor like a fish, I am dolphin (I shant be leashed). MULTI-PENTA-MEGA-KILL. Overpowered is misused, it should only be used when describing the vindicator, but in actuallity, the vindicator is more than that, it is my love, it is my life, it is better than any csgo knife.  11/14 for rhyming : ^ ) #poeticjustice #irefusetosuckyourdick ~ ANTHONY",

You see we were having a grand old time dicking around on rooftops which is arguably the worst and saltiest map in this game which led my good old friend Anthony to start spam using the most godly weapon known to all men of this divebombing and sliding game world, the Vindisaltshaker (Vindicator obv). This weapon allowed this boyo to camp at the top of all the buildings to the point where the amount of salt being shook on my buddy Covalent led him into a blood inducing rage. He turned the tide of this glorious battle by also using the VINDISALTSHAKER and shaking the salt back into Anthony's ♥♥♥. This led to a full 15 minutes of butthurtness where both of them camped on roofs oneshotting eachother with me standing on the side too spooked to move, you see im REALLY BAD at this game so i would occasionally try to intervene but get SALT FIRED ALL UPON ME and DIE instantaneously everytime. I could recommend this game to any group of friends but never, ever let anyone use the vindicator for a full match, it will lead to a neverending war of intense hatred for everyone where now I am caught in the middle unsure of what to do next, do i use the Vindicator? or do I continue being complete ♥♥♥♥? What will become of the friendship between us Bonds? Only time will tell. but srsly dis is gud game - the middle man  All in all a solid 9.674/10",

I can say without a doubt, this is the best free fps shooter I've ever played (exception for Tf2, but I like this game equally for reasons that Tf2 can't support)  Free download, runs on a lower end PC (just making the asumption it does because I have a powerful PC, but the game is obviously not the most demanding program)  Well worth your time.",

Choose 1 of several perks, choose your weapons, then fly through the air in combat.  Attack: Left click is shoot, Middle Wheel click is melee, f is grenade if you have it equipped Stunts: Right click makes you tackle-dive, ctrl then right click makes you slide-tackle. In most cases it is good to always be using your stunts Shift: more accurate aim, very useful with the Vindicator rifle on the rooftop map C: activate slow motion if you have time built up B: Switch your weapons or ablility at any time  My Strategy: Brawler with Vindicator + H.E. Grenade or Brawler with Vindicator + Undertaker Vindicator is a powerful rifle decent for short/mid range, but great at long distance. Use Shift to snipe a few players before propelling your body head first to the lower rooftop, guns blazing. Grenade is good for multikills, and areas where players mosh together, not much else to say about that. Undertaker is a fast sub machine gun for close quarters. It works will with the Vindicator in that once you empty the vindicator's clip, you can quickly switch to the Undertaker to get a quick life-saving kill before reloading your primary. MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE Did I mention that you should melee as a brawler? Your melee strength is higher as a brawler, and kills, especially melee kills, build up a brawler bar. Once it is in the 80s or higher range, you can switch to your fists by pressing 1 and then left click. Your fists should be glowing. Now run around spamming left and right click, you will rack up tons of multikills on close-quarter parts of maps, like on Rooftop. Today is my first day playing this game, but I have to say it's a good game utilizing the Source Engine pretty will. It's a nice break from more serious shooters, and will surely be one to play with your pals. ",

Points are scored based on stunt points, earned by scoring kills mid leap, mid slide, dodging grenades, headshots and more. There are a number of weapons to choose from, but few playable characters to choose from.  This game features a slow-motion gimmick, where you earn seconds on a slow-mo clock that, when activated, slows time around you (moreso for your opponents) to make aiming easy. There are several maps and you will quickly find areas on these maps that you will want to control in order to dish out the most damage. Protip: da_cocaine's garage entrance ramp.  This game is exclusively multiplayer, but does support bots.

'I am dead' you mutter to yourself as you blindly throw a grenade to his location. He tries to dive away from it, but it's too late....  Both of you are sent flying away from the rooftop of the building into the majestic fall to meet Mr.Concrete at street level. While you fall, you start to shoot your nemesis, and so he does until all you have left is your pistol, only carrying one bullet inside. You take your time to aim, 5 seconds until you hit the ground, and shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Turns out it was a headshot, the guy who was previously blazing his guns at you is now nothing but a blood-stained corpse free-falling, and you enter slow-motion in just enough time to sigh, re-think your whole life as the damned Mr.Concrete comes closer. You then drop your pistol and sends it flying to the side while you close your eyes and enter a free-falling pose, your body now being embraced by the concrete, all your bones having been broken and your miserable life extinguished from the face of the Earth.

That is really a nice touch, and I think most games that has FFA should implement this feature!   At first, the movement is kind of something you need to get used to, because it can be very slippery and glidy. But once you get the hang of it, it is pretty fun! It is not bunny hopping, it is Squirrel Hopping! :D  The only thing I probably don't like about this game would have to be the lack of game-modes that is currently out there (as of 11.2.14), and that the player models looks very generic. They don't really fit with the whole theme of the game. But other than that, it is pretty fun! A lot better than other free stand-alone mods out there. (Looking at you Fistful of Frags &lt;_&lt; )",

            "review_text": "Dustforce truly is a work of art. I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level.   Another thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.  Overall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:  10/10 BUY THIS GAME. ",

But a standalone game. WHAT? After I got over the stupidity of the missing textures I joined a different server. I could spawn, and there wasn't missing textures. It lagged so bad it was already terrible. On top of all this there was people flying through the air sideways like a bunch of hackers. Here's the funny part though, THEY WEREN'T HACKING. Are you amazed at this game yet. Due to this 'reasonable gameplay' you couldn't hit anyone. There is one good part, there was slowmo! Of course you couldn't use it unless you killed someone while flying past them on your side leaving you an interval of 0.1 seconds to hit them. But then you get some seconds of slowmo! It's all worth it... :) Bad aiming. Period. There was this brilliant map that was like fighting on rooftops. The problem is that it was an extremely small map and you constantly fall off the edge and die. But that's all in the fun right? Oh and the amazing 'killcam' which featured a really 'high quality' picture of you holding a 'gun' while 'someone' is 'shooting' at you!

The fast-paced action and silliness makes it a great game to play when bored and not in the mood to play a more serious game like CSGO. The classes and gun types also help make it more than just a game where you jump around and do flips while shooting people. The point system is interesting and perfect for this game. Rather than get points by getting kills, you get them by landing bullits on opponents in the most stylish way possible. This encouraged me to do crazier things in order to win. One time, I found myself jumping at a wall, bouncing off it, and then doing a flip mid air while shooting at someone behind the wall. That right there makes this game awesome.

You can run faster, jump higher, and activate slow motion. All of these specials are more powerful depending on the class you pick. But to be honest tactics dont matter.

I gauruntee you will be laughing from having a shotgun vs uzi duel where all of you are flipping around and jumping off buildings at the same time. The game is also 'anti sore loser 12 year old friendly'. Heres some examples. I walked around shooting when I saw a COD player doing flips in the air but not doing anything else. I pointed my shotgun at him and took em' out. He then started screaming into his mic but was targeted by my fellow players until he left. Another time a noob who did not know how to do stunts started running at me shooting while I stood facing a dead end. He then stood still to aim for my head when I jumped on the wall, flipping over him, and getting a one-shot head-shot kill. He then proceeded to call me a hacker and yell at me screeming like a baby. My fellow players then targeted him and called HIM a hacker every time he killed them until he left through fear that we would report him to someplace.  10/10 sore loser free",

TS was my favorite mod for such a long time and when the servers died out I was completely bummed out. TS failed after 2.1 when it was completely screwed up at 3.0.  While I have fun playing double action it really in no way holds a candle to TS. Such limited weapon selection the no kick to disarm enemies, and being light enough to do front flips while running is completely left out of this game as well. A person carrying a rifle isnt much slower/less manuverable than someone with just a pistol. Ammunition seems endless in TS when i would go on a run and be the specialist i would have to pick up random weapons just to find something with ammo all the time adding to skill being able to use em all. Point system based on hits while sliding and all that is not cool either. TS was a kill death ratio game and the stunts were used to escape or aid in doing so. I will still rate this positive just because it makes me smile thinking of TS. Steam should bring back the specialists 2.1 and then we would all be having fun.",

Action Summary: 'In train station, camping upstairs balcony bathroom. Immediately get two kills jump flip out the side window run to top of stairs hit another long range HS. Slide down the stairs into a jump slide into the train track pulls out double M9's proceed to get 2 more kills. Got stuck trying to jump out and got HS'd by a guy with a shotty and then ran over by the train.'

Double Action features some really balanced gameplay, your skill is your skill, nothing else is the determining factor for success. You will run, jump, slide, and grapple your way through a series of levels, designed by mere mortals, as if they were designed my gods.

I gauruntee you will be laughing from having a shotgun vs uzi duel where all of you are flipping around and jumping off buildings at the same time. The game is also 'anti sore loser 12 year old friendly'. Heres some examples. I walked around shooting when I saw a COD player doing flips in the air but not doing anything else. I pointed my shotgun at him and took em' out. He then started screaming into his mic but was targeted by my fellow players until he left. Another time a noob who did not know how to do stunts started running at me shooting while I stood facing a dead end. He then stood still to aim for my head when I jumped on the wall, flipping over him, and getting a one-shot head-shot kill. He then proceeded to call me a hacker and yell at me screeming like a baby. My fellow players then targeted him and called HIM a hacker every time he killed them until he left through fear that we would report him to someplace.  10/10 sore loser free",

It is pretty old, and can get kinda annoying when running into one of the many bugs, or hackers, but overall, it's so much fun.  I will also note that there isn't a huge variety of weapons to chose from, and the classes aren't super amazing, but they do offer unique gameplay. The one gamemode that is available in this game is also a bit unclear.   Overall I give this game a pretty solid 7.5/10, since it does have it's bugs, and can be littered with hackers at times. Other than that, the gameplay itself is really fun, and unique to anything I've really ever played.",

Sad thing is that nobody plays it, although I think if more people talked about how good it was, that would be a much different story all together. Unique mechanics make this game both competitively balanced and fun as hell. Movement options are optimal and fun to use, as abusing Matrix style wall flips to dive out of them to escape a deadly fall in the nick of time is honestly one of the most badass maneurvers in this game. Though there are no wallruns or other horizontal movement options other than your special dives and running, the utter feeling of power is there. The bullet time is also fun as hell and is rewarded for ballsy kills, which makes it honestly feel less cheap. I found myself getting killed with skilled players who dipped and dived through bullets like I was. Few of these times was I found in the midst of a bullet time beating.
