    "description": "1849 is a city management game set during the California Gold Rush. Your task is to build towns, populate them with workers, and make sure that they are housed, fed, and entertained. Youâ€™ll have to manage and coordinate extensive production and trade networks to make sure your towns thrive.",

            "review_text": "I may not have many hours of play on Steam just yet, but I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say I have already clocked at least 100 hours on this game ever since I got it on IndieGameStand, so I thought this game deserved a nice little review for all potential fellow players out there.  The premise of 1849 is a classic one, and the game may not have loads of different buildings to build or hundreds of different resources to collect, but rest assured that it has more than enough to keep you busy for a long time. The casual-looking interface hides a challenging city management simulation and everything in the game works together just perfectly. There are no electricity grids or traffic jams, but the simple yet challenging resource management and production chain systems are crafted wonderfully and the game stays engaging, inciting you to expand and to find the perfect balance between farms, factories, saloons and houses. Make no mistake, 1849 is casual and I love its refined simplicity because it makes the game so easy to pick up, but at the same time it plays like a true management game and it can get quite hard, and I love it equally - if not more - for that.  And as if the game mechanics weren't enough, the game is also set in a period of time that easily speaks to the imagination and that has been crafted beautifully in the visuals of each little part of the game. In every building, every tree and every person walking through the streets you can feel the atmosphere of the bustling town you're shaping where only moments ago was nothing but forests and meadows. Combine that with the challenges from the management mechanics, and it's easy to see why this game gives you such a rewarding sense of accomplishment but at the same time gives you the need to keep going and keep making your town better.  I got this game in the daily deal on IGS for only a few bucks, but knowing how much I've already enjoyed playing this game I would happily pay full price for this game that is quickly becoming one of my favourites.",

Would I reccomend this game? If you like city-building games, like I do, and if you like the old western style that 1849 brings you, yes. It's cheap, yet enjoyable at certain areas. So yes. you should deffinetly try it out.",

Although i dont expect too replay this as much as other titles(wich where more costly^^) I still would recommend this game since price vs hours played is decent and it runs flawless",

Some of the gameplay mechanics were a bit off-putting at first since I have played a lot of games of this type, but once I figured out the gist of it I had a good time playing right through all 20 missions.   The length of each mission felt just right for a good play session. It could use a few UI enhancements (namely automated buy/sell orders) but too much of this would trivialize the game. I can say there were several times I was glad the AI did not autobuy/sell as the further you get into a mission, the money you have on hand can fluctuate quite a bit!  I have to add that while there are not many tracks, the music is top-notch. I caught myself humming it outside the game on more than one occasion.",

            "review_text": "I really enjoy this game, it's addictive in a strange, perfectionist, control-freak sort of way. I love city builders but was looking for some a little more simple than a huge sim-city type deal and without the combat that other strategy games have. I never get bored with the diverse scenarios each map brings and the acheivements you can obtain.   I have had no major gameplay issues, and have no serious complaints. As far as suggestions may go, I was hoping for a little more financial control, rather than really just balancing the wage-rent ratio. It gets a little annoying having to manually go in and sell my products every 10 seconds, whereas it would seem like a nice addition to offer contracts to the other cities in the same way you sometimes get from completeing commissions- every month a certain number of resources is sent over automatically.  Also, the population(?) advisor lady gets on my nerves, it seems like people in every city want to expand insanely quicker than your set up or ready to handle regardless of the scenario. Obviously people in a vineyard paradise are going to demand nice things, but in small mining town scenarios people begin to demand luxuries that are not availiable for that map (cobbler, tailor, etc) and end up throwing a hissy fit and leaving. That sort of control of expansion and growth seems like it would be nice to have as the mayor. It seems unrealistic that during this time period a small mining outpost would attract the rich, family-type crowd.   On the opposite end of the spectrum I have had issues with houses refusing the expand even though the conditions are met, but I have no idea if that is part of the game considering they were the first few houses I built and subsequent houses did expand quickly.  And one tiny thing that just upsets my OCD personality, is that you cannot rotate buildings. In my opinion, its the simple details that sets a game apart from a city-builder farming phone game. Even from the screen shots you see building stacked in clusters behind and infront of each other. This is a game that can boast time-period accuracy, but the concept of anyone, anytime moving into town and opening up a shoestore that directly blocks your front porch seems unlikely. It's purely an aesthetic annoyance, but seemed worth a mention.  Overall though, seriously I love this game. And it takes some serious willpower to walk away even for a second.",

But that could be solved in a future edition (Yukon &amp; Alaska), where you set a minimum and maximum of each type of goods, then auto-sell. All in all I recommend, for the price of less than $15 for the game and expansion. You get what you pay for, don't expect perfection, when you are not paying $50.",

After 1400 pop the game is getting filled with lag and glitches but nothing game-changing. I need even bigger maps.",

            "review_text": "Though I liked the concept, it somehow feels unfinished...  Expanding your town (which can be very expensive) leads to people settling in. If you don't provide room for them to build houses, they start building plots somewhere which you can't destroy. If you don't provide resources for them to upgrade their housesthey are probably going to move out again. But they don't just move out, they also take their stuff with them, so any upgrades done already will be dismantled and the resources are gone.  If you don't provide enough jobs, they are probably moving out too.. The problem is. Building workplaces is very expensive. Sometimes you can't even come to a positive outcome, let me demonstrate this with a bit of math: Running a Bakery costs 50 $ / week and provides 4 workplaces. So each of these 4 workers cost you 12,5 $ / week. Plus you have to pay 300 $ to build the Bakery in the first place. Running a Goldmine costs 100 $ / week for 10 workers. So each one costs you 10 $ / week. A medium Townhouse with 19 residents brings you 115 $ income / week, that is ~6 $ income / week per citizen.  In my games, I was always very close to bankruptcy, gladly, there are financial aids that save you once with a 500 $ cash injection. It took me some time to realize how essential trading is to succeed in a game. However, the trading system is a bit unhandy. You first have to form a traderoute, which can cost you up to 300 $, but then you can't set up automatic trades, you basically have to wait for your workers to mine for gold, and sell it yourself.  Altogether, my games have been very brief, as I had to stay in a constant expansion to provide enough jobs and get the resources my workers needed to upgrade their homes (so they pay higher rents, which, however, wasn't enough either). And the constant expansion plus selling your stuff plus buying the stuff your villagers need - but you can't provide because you sadly don't have any lumber in this area - may take all your concentration, because there aren't really any tools to support you.   Though I can imagine that the gold rush in California actually caused very rapid growth, it seemed kinda odd that I can't even build a single stable situation where I provide jobs, food, and houses and have a positive revenue...  It was fun playing, but as I said, it feels kinda.. unfinished.",
