            "review_text": "This game is short. Very short. If you are going to get this series then you are better off buying all of the East Tower chapters at the same time. The art is meh, but the overall storyline is interesting; I have found this game more interesting than some games that have had amazing art, but crap story. Its a pure visual novel with choices, so no stat building or anything. It is very easy to 100% this game in one sitting.  The main character is female, but she tends to dress and act like an boy. She convinces her fmaily member (brother, cousin? I don't remmeber) to let her participate in this virtual reality game demo aimed at guys. She dresses up as a guy and the games begin. In the game everyone appears as their heart really desires, so the MC is male in the game world. Also everyone gets trapped in the game, and the main focus is to get out. The game is romantic, but you only interact with whatever East Tower-Character Name you purchased. Since this is East Tower-Akio, Akio is the romanceale guy.",

            "review_text": "East Tower - Akio redefines visual novels by removing branching storylines and replacing them with a linear story. The limited choices in the game don't affect the outcome, they just affect how much of the story you'll see. For example, in a typical level, the first choice you make will decide whether to progress to the next choice or whether you'll have to start the stage again. If you pass that, the second choice will decide whether you get the standard stage ending or the standard stage ending plus a romantic scene. Get all the romantic scenes and you'll get the big romantic ending at the end of the game.  Because of the linear narrative, it can feel more like a film than a game. Whether you enjoy it or not will depend on how much you enjoy the story. I thought it was creative and interesting. Thumbs up.",
