            "review_text": "I wanted to like this game but it's just not a good game. I only played it for 15 minutes but it's enough. The idea is cool, the art looks good and the music sounds fun but the game just doesn't make much sense. I'm not even complaining about it being an obvious mobile port (It lacks a lot of things that should come standard on pc games. Like a button or toggle for fullscreen).  The game drops you in a match with only one vague picture as explanation. The level layout and enemies seem to be randomly generated in your disfavour. Enemies deal higher damage and have more movement. I beat the first level when it generated only 1 enemy instead of 3, taking all the health pickups for myself then resorting to a headbutting fest without any movement until one of us was down.  I won a piece of equipment and some bananas but cant seem to be able to actually equip it yet. Maybe the slot is unlocked later, that wasn't clear.  Perhaps I've been playing it wrong. I hope the game has more to offer. I'll come back to it sometime after it receives some updates. Can't recommend it at the moment, if ever. I went into it expecting a simple and casual tactical game with a heavy focus on positioning but it's not even that. Nice idea but lacks in execution. I look forward to updates.",

(Pointing to conspicuously large hole in his pants)  Yeah, that's pretty much how you're going to be feeling if you pay more than $0.25 for this piece of do doo.  I started up the game, and went into the SETTINGS panel, oops, there are no settings to adjust just sound and music. So I guess you'll be playing this in a microscopic window on your desktop.  Then from the main menu, I made the mistake of clicking the button labeled 'Multiplayer'. This caused the game to present me with a JPEG picture of a beach, and that's where it sat doing nothing, not even a pixel on the screen changing for 2 minutes until I CTRL+ALT+DELETE and killed it in the Windows Task Manager.  Upon reloading I tried the single player campaign, and was greeted with a game interface which communicated virtually no objectives and did not explain how to interact with or play the game. I tried clicking around to see if I could figure out what the inputs do, but each left or right click produced different results with no consistency.  Eventually I figured out how to control the Rhino. That's when I realized that the levels in the game are not crafted to ensure a certain progression of difficulty going from 'learning the ropes' and getting harder from there. No, the game just throws randomly generated maps at you with a random number of enemies. Good luck on your first map when 5 enemies who have the same attack power as you, all converge on you at once.  I give this game 1 TRILLION head butts with a sharpened Rhinoceros horn Krazy Glued to my forehead.",
