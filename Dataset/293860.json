            "review_text": "White Noise Online is multiplayer-based Slender-type game, by which I mean it's a horror game where you go around collecting eight randomly placed objects while avoiding a monster that's hunting you. Slenderman isn't actually involved here, and there's some twists to the formula here to keep it interesting, but the baseline is that this is an online co-op Slender-type game, and that fact will either sell you or turn you away from the game.  You play as one of over 20 characters in some very dark environment collecting cassettes. Strange statues line the environments, and a strange glowing monster chases you through the depths of darkness, with an intent to kill. However, the story here is rather non-existent, with the only narrative coming from an opening scene before the title screen, and the audio content that plays on the cassettes themselves when you pick them up.  The cassettes emit a static sound to alert you that they're nearby, which is helpful to the formula as the stages in this game are bigger than most Slender-type games and the monster is notably more aggressive. One feature kind of cool and creepy about the monster is that he makes appropriately unnerving sounds to both sort of alert you where he is, and unnerve you. It can be creepy to be in a tight-corridor area and not see him, but it sounds like he's right next to you. Staring at the monster will slowly deplete your 'health', and he'll kill you if you let him get too close to you. There are also green-glowing statues placed around the environment randomly, and staring at them or getting too close will have the same effects the monster has (though of course the statues can't move). The statues emit a static-sound similar to the cassettes (though different enough to tell) to lead players to a tricky end.  There are four difficulty levels, which mostly determine the difficulty of the monster, how many statues there are, and cassette placement possibility.  The game also has a panic-system that's kind of similar to what you'll find in Clock Tower 3 or Haunting Ground. When you are isolated and alone, your character will start panicking (which can be noted when the character starts making panicked sounds and the screen starts acting up), and eventually starts tripping all over the place and making a lot of noise, which attracts the monster. This can be settled by either collecting cassettes, or finding other people.  How prone they are to this depends on what character you play as. There are over 20 different characters, and they all have different stats. These are represented by an image for each 'category' (the images can be confusing at first, can read up on what each one means in the How to Play section on the options menu), with a notice of if they're stronger or weaker in this area than other characters (represented by a +1 to +3, or a -1 to -3, if not shown then they are neutral, or default, in that area). Areas effected include sanity (take less damage from the monsters attacks), flashlight battery life (the longer you keep your flashlight on, the more it will flicker and start becoming dimmer and dimmer), movement speed, stamina (for running), scout (the further distance you can get from characters before panicking), evasion (how high you are on the monsters priority list), and more. You only start with four characters, while the other ones are unlocked by playing the game and accomplishing tasks.  There's also some fun multiplayer mechanics that are rather well thought-out. Firstly, death. When a player dies, they then become a ghost, which is visible to the living players as a blue silhouette of the character that died. The ghosts can stick around the living players to help prevent them from panicking, or they can go out and scout for cassettes. The ghosts see the level much more brightly than the living do, and they also move a lot faster around the level. However, they cannot see the monster, but can spot cassettes. This can be helpful in downtime and to be helpful even after death. The second feature cool for multiplayer is the results screen, which displays fun information like the total distance each person walked, number of cassettes each individual collected, how many times they were hit by a scare attack and 'screamed', how long they survived, etc., along with a map that shows the routes that each player took during the course of the game.  The game currently has six maps, though the devs have noted if it does well they plan to add more. The maps are fairly varied, with themes like tropical island, government base, museum, snowy forest, and the like. There are three different map 'styles', with two maps under each style. The first is big-open levels that have monuments, like the original Slender. The second are closed-spaces interior maps with twisting corridors, rooms, and labyrinth-like structures. The final are 'island' stages, which has parts of levels connected with tunnels, bridges, and the like, with the level segments being separated like islands.  This game was an Xbox Live release originally, the main difference in the Steam version right now is that all characters are now unlockable (as opposed to some characters only obtainable by owning other games), achievements, and they've updated the graphics some. This said, more updates may arise in the future to further differentiate it.  In short, it's a very confident Slender game, actually one of my favorites. The online multiplayer is fun and well-thought out, and the game still manages to be tense and scary at times. If you like Slender-based games and have wanted or are interested in trying a multiplayer-based version of that type of game, this is it. There really isn't any better, and the game does very well at what it sets out to do. However, if you don't enjoy Slender-type games, or the multiplayer focus doesn't interest you, this probably won't interest you. The game maybe works better in short bursts than long marathons, but it's still a fun little multiplayer horror game.",

            "review_text": "Treat this as a mixed review. I'm 50/50 towards this game.  Considering the price and the fact that I got this game in a pretty cheap bundle, I'd say it's worth a shot. Slenderman-like game with co-op. It's not really scare, the monster design is lacking severely, the sound design is not really frightening and the environment looks cheaply made, the character animation is choppy, but it's not even a AA title, so no reason to complain. It seems more like a Scooby Doo game than anything else. I will complain, however, that most achievements can only be unlocked by playing 4 player co-op. So if you're in an online game with one other person, you won't get the achievements. And since there aren't that many people playing, you'll probably going to have to buy the game for some people to help you get the achievement, or look into the forums. ",

Monster is actually scary looking. 2.The way you find the monster, either through the towers or him just poping up, actuall does suprise you when you first see him. 3.They incorperated the 'Don't look and just run' idea. 4. It's a real challenge. 5. Dev is great and very helpful, seems to know what he's talking about. Even put up with my stupidity.  Cons: 1. Somehow managed to make the controls clunky and slidey at the same time. 2. A snail could outrun these characters. 3. Why incorperate a flashlight if it barely works? 4. Really hard to find the cassets. I know i said challenge was a pro, but this is like, really hard. Could turn some people off.  All in all, the game is good, but far from perfect",

            "review_text": "My review comes from a man who previously purchased this game for a dollar on Xbox 360. At the time, it was the best dollar I had ever spent on a digital game because this game is fun . . . if you have friends . . . and if you need to kill small amounts of time. The gameplay is very simple as you walk around searching for 8 tapes while avoiding eye contact with a monster and strange green statues., which is something I actuallly appreciate about WNO.  The visuals and music are also simple. That's fine. It makes it easier to see/hear the tapes you need to collect and the monster you need to avoid.  It's compared to Slender, and rightfully so. That's also fine. I liked Slender well enough.   I'd definitely recommend playing with friends and not taking this game too seriously.   However, the asking price is much higher than on Xbox. If, over time, new content is added beyond new maps and characters, then the price may be fair.  But, I still bought it and installed it on my Steambox. I had good memories playing it on my Xbox 360 with friends, and want it available on Steam. I will encourage my friends to buy it so I can play with them.   If you play alone, either wait for a steep discount or go all-in and buy the 4-pack to take advantage of what makes this game enjoyable - simple, stupid fun with friends.  I'll recommend buying it as a small co-op game.",

The story is a little difficult to understand what happened and how this creature became to be. But the graphics in this game are amazing for just a simple price. The character designs are unique and different from any other game that I've seen. The atmosphere is what really gets you though when your playing by yourself or with friends.  ---------  This game is like any slender game that is out there. Collect 8 audio recordings and avoid the creature that is stalking you, trying to prevent you from collecting the audio recordings so that you won't know what happened to others who have encountered it.  The creature creation is unique as well. It's different from others out there but it almost as the same mechanics as the slender game.   All and all, I really like this game and I enjoy it. The only problem I have though is that there isn't a whole lot of area's for you to play on, which is saddening. ",
