It's even better now. One of the best games in this genre, and developers and the fanbase knows it. It's got the graphic to be timeless, cool sound effects which gives deep satisfaction, a surprisingly decent political system and several win conditions. It's got great depth variety depending on preference and chosen settings. Top tier game of my life.",

            "review_text": "This is my favorite game of all time. I bought it on CD when it first came out and played a ton of it as a kid. It has been installed on every computer I've owned since that time. I have also purchased it from GOG and as part of the collector's edition of the new Master of Orion. It has aged quite well and is still an enjoyable game to play in 2016.  This is one of the grandfathers of the turn-based strategy genre and if you've ever heard of the term 4x strategy, it comes from this game. You eXpand, eXplore, eXploit, and eXterminate. You start with one planet and scout nearby planets and colonize them in an attempt to grow your empire. Along the way, you'll need to research new technologies, build fleets, train spies, build improvements on your planets, engage alien races in diplomacy, and whatever else it takes to ensure that your empire thrives.  The game is fairly intuitive and you should get the basic idea of how to play after a game. Individual games can take several hours like a game of Civilization. There is a great custom race editor that allows you to tweak your own race with attributes that go well with your play style. It's a fun and epic game with some really nice background music. The turn-based ship battles are pretty fun as well.  I don't know if this will release as a standalone game later on, but if not, you can always get MOO1+2 at GOG. If you don't mind the outdated graphics, this is a fun strategic space game that will make you want to click next turn just one more time.  Favorite game of all time/10",

If you've never tried this game, please do. If you like space empire building, it is simple, complicated, and vastly rewarding. Each playhtrough tells a new story, and the evolution of your empire and species is yours to decide.   But, what am I doing writing about it? PLAY IT. You will be pleasantly surprised even after so many years! ",

            "review_text": "The very first game I ever played on the IBM when it was given to us back in 1995. The one that gave us both the computer and the game absolutely insisted that we go with Strategic Combat only, but after a month of that I decided to try out Tactical combat. I never looked back.  Playing on Easy difficulty was a challenge at first to get to know all the mechanics, but of course you have to gradually grow up the ladder to a higher difficulty. My very first encounter with the Stellar Converter was on Easy difficulty. A single ship was coming into my planet, so I sent my fleet to meet it at the planet expecting an easy win like usual.  That first turn the planet was annihilated by a squealing yellow beam that I had not seen before. All defenses gone, all population gone. Only my orbital was present with the five ships I sent. I did not even learn what weapon it was until several years later when I actually took the time to read /all/ of the technologies in the game.  Ahhh, memories. Nowadays I play on the hardest difficulty with very little trouble. Not even the Silicoid ever pose a threat to me even if they send out 500 ships, but all I will ever need is one. Phasing Cloak + Time-Warp Facilitator = Win... Just need to WAIT until all enemy ships have moved that turn before attacking. Otherwise, even with damper fields and Xentronium armor you're toast.  My ultimate loadout: 2 Stellar Converters (at 250 space apiece - Weapons Hypertech 6 required) 6 Tractor Beams 4 Assault Shuttles 99 Gauss Cannons (Heavy, Auto-Fire) 99 Gauss Cannons (Auto-Fire) Any other weapons I want  Battle Pods Structural Analyzer (2x damage after shields penetrated) Achilles Targeting Unit (Ignore armor, including Heavy Armor and Xentronium) Phasing Cloak Subspace Teleporter Time-Warp Facilitator Damper Field Slot 8 whatever I want to have at the time  With this loadout, even Adamantium Armor has difficulty holding up. Gauss loves targeting internal systems, so you'll be experiencing a /LOT/ of sudden explosions from the enemy ships due to a Warp Core Breach that damages other nearby ships...which can even trigger chain reactions if the shields are penetrated. Works for the Orion Guardian, too, and much more reliable than the Ion Pulse Cannon. You /WILL/ need Disruptors or better if you're going up against a Planetary Barrier Shield, though.",

Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve, especially on higher difficulties, I can say that I am really enjoying this game. Once you know how to play the game, and learn to survive against the NPCs that somehow have better technology than you even though you're a creative democracy with a plus in science... then it pretty much becomes a really intence game that comes with the nature of any 4X game, and in this one, being able to be the best race and win is so satisfying. (unless you win by diplomacy of course. pfft! Like THAT'S any fun!)  All in all, great game. It's amazing how addictive this game is, especially for a game that's only 4(X) years younger than I am. Most DOS games aren't all that attractive imo, but this is certainly an exception.",

Overall: 6/10  Pros:  - it is a classic game therefore pretty well balanced tactically - this for me is important and therefore a big pro.  - random events e.g. Antarians/hydra invasions are surprisingly strong initially (I expected them to be a walkover, but they often destroy a few planets).  Cons:  - graphics very out of date (obv)  - no ingame help - game doesn't explain its dynamics so you'll be searching Google to understand many things.  - understanding battle is hard work and even when you do, not very engaging.  - lacks shortcuts/userfriendliness that we come to expect with more modern games.  Overall, it's worth a small amount of money. I paid $4 and am happy but that's the maximum you'd want to pay.",
