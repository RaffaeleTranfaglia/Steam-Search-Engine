            "review_text": "If you haven't heard of Age of Empires, then say hello to one of the most iconic RTS franchises. With the release of Age of Empires 2 HD Edition, there's quite a bit to go around for fans of the franchise. But enough about that, how is Age of Empire 3?  Well it really depends on what you're after. Visually, it's still pretty freaking gorgeous, and it holds up quite well, though it does show its age a bit (what do you expect for an 9 year old game). the lighting effects are great, and the smoke and particle effects, especially the destructible debris that falls of buildings is a nice visual treat, and I remember how amazing it looked back in 2005, and to me it still looks great.  In terms of gameplay, it feels more in line with Age of Mythology, Ensemble's previous entry, rather than Age of Empires. From the way you choose a leader each age (mirrors choosing minor deities in Age of Mythology) to general UI layout and control schemes, AoE3 feels much like a spiritual successor to Age of Mythology, with a focus on historics rather than mythos.   Though with this iteration of the series, there are new, much needed improvements. Gone is the need for a drop off point for your workers; like the Atlantean race in AoM:TT (Age of Mythology: The Titans), your workers only need to mine from the resource to generate that resource. This makes macromangement considerably less fiddly.   Another change is how Caravans work in AoE3; instead of building a market, creating some caravans, and sending them to a Town Centre, there are now neutral Trading Posts that need to capture, which provide a steady steam of either Wood, Gold, Food or Experience. There are other neutral buildings the map, such as native settlements, or saloons which give you access to new units.   But by far the biggest addition to the series is the Home City. The Home City has a deck of shipment cards which can be sent to you during the game, depending on how many levels you gain through experience (gained by fighting, find treasure, building or from aforementioned trade caravans). The shipments can range from dozens of cavalry soldiers, supplies of wood/gold/food, to permanent improvements to military, defense, economy and so on. It can change how you play, and it's an interesting additon to the game.  The singleplayer in the Complete Collection offers up plenty of content, with about 8 campaigns, ranging from 15th/16th Century colonials to Battle at Little Bighorn, to the Indian Revolution, and even a little bit in Japan during the Sengoku period. It has plenty of nicely realised characters, interesting stories for each campaign, and enough content for each campaign so they don't feel short. This along with the 14 civilizations you can play in singleplayer (and multiplayer, though there isnt much of a population) skirmishes means plenty of content for your money's worth.   If you're new to the Age of Empires franchise or if you enjoyed Age of Mythology, then Age of Empires 3 will be a fun ride through some events through history. If you preferred Age of Empires 2, then you might not like Age of Empires 3 quite as much. For me though, its a hearty recommendation.",

            "review_text": "Still better than  Age of Empires 2 .  Strike one for imperialism.  Looks nice, sounds nice, cannons are a great feature, has a working online service, trading cards, steam hours counting, *breathes*, all the DLC you might have missed in the old days, great 3-tiered base campaign which follows a families lineage.   Takes place in the times of exploration, which is a nice departure from ancient times.  The simplification of some game features were hit or miss, some were niceties, others just are too simple. An example of one that was a miss was the removal of individual farm squares, and collection buildings, although it can be assumed that it is automated, it still seems too simple.  Has a nice variety of units, although, the crossbowmen seem kind of weaksauce when I got Janissaries with guns and cannons so big they can be used for artillery. Its let hack and slash, blow for blow of some other strategy games, and more so the style of 'you mess up, you just might die'.  Price is a little on the high side however, and if you can get it cheaper than $40, I would whole heartidly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Though many people say AOE2 is the best in the franchise, I actually think AOE3, with the abundance of exotic civs from 2 expansions and unofficial mods, has surpassed that timeless classic.  Graphics: AOE3 looks great at distance, even up to today's standards. That's mainly due to the excellent using of lighting effects (shades and HDR), the textures and animation on a closer look however, are on the same level as Age of Mythology (kinda obvious they used the same engine), which is a little bit dated. But it doesn't hurt at all, for some of the best RTS games like SupCom and COH aren't beautiful up close either.  Sound: Soundtracks are awesome, definitely the best in the franchise and probably one of the best in the whole genre. I especially love the track of revolution event, it pumps me up so much that I want to punch a freaking baby in the face. Sound effects are even more impressive, more so the sound of canons. God how I love the sound of canon fire in this game, every shot is like the mixture of bass solo and Morgan Freeman monologue coming out of a subwoofer. Pure heaven.  Gameplay: Quite different from the previous games. The tempo has been speeded up a bit. Range attack becomes the mainstream and melee the sidekick. Resources are down to 3, which I think is acceptable. Civs feel very distinct from each other especially those from different continents. Balance is marginally okay, with 3 pretty OP civs and same amount of trench tier ones. Many new features like homecity and card deck building are actually great fun and add a lot to the strategic depth. Online games are quite stable and smooth, and usually end in stomping.  Mods: I love the mod Napoleonic Era to death. This along with another mod called The War of the Triple Alliance make me rate this game among top 3 RTS on my list. Holy crap the additional civs and features are mindblowing. I really wish for 2 things, that we will one day get Steam Workshop for AOE3 and one day the devs of these two mods be contracted by Microsoft to combine the mods into an official expansion, just like The Forgotten to AOE2.   Community: Friendly, steady, small in size but alive. That's all I can say.  Conclusion: Don't let nostalgia get the best of you. AOE3 is different from AOE2, but in a good way.",

            "review_text": "I own two coppies of AOE3, that's just how great of a game it is. Between my retail copy and my steam copy I'd have nearly 1000 hours played. Positives: 'Card Deck Tech Tree' Allows you to select up to 35 technologies that are unlocked based on your XP in the match. The abillity to name your Explorer and Homecity. City leveling and user leveling adds noticeable multiplayer progression. Tradepost [specified spots on the map allow you to build a tradepost for extra resources, units and technologies offering a bit of a King Of The HIll feel]. Negatives: No diplomacy [unless a custom scenario], only 3 team options [FFA, 1 or 2], no capturing enemy units/technologies [in previous games you could use your priest/monk to convert enemies to your team].",

            "review_text": "A game from back when RTS games were still riding high, when 'base building' wasn't a dirty word and factions were meant to be colourful and fun. It shows its age now, but the core mechanics are still solid.  An unusual characteristic of an RTS was persistency; or how your play affected you in the next game. AOE III had experience gain over time that would unlock 'cards', which then could be called into play in a future match. This also came with nice cosmetic upgrades for a 'capital' city, which let players really feel that they were leading an army into battle. Sadly these cosmetic upgrades were not in place for Asian or American civilizations in the expansions, although the persistant card unlocks are still present.  The factions are nicely done. The European factions all largely play the same, with some emphasis on artillery, cavalry, or infantry between them. Asian civilizations are also fairly similar, just implementing 'wonders' as well as other minor changes. I do like the emphasis on the Americans, who end up playing much more differently as they lack the hard defenses that others do. Overall these different factions make for a high level of replayability.  An old game, but worth the money. Especially since newer quality RTSs are infrequent.",

Either you're going to play it alone or with friends , its so much fun. i'd recommend buying this game in full/sale prices , worth it anyway. 9.5/10.",
