Anyways, it's a cute little game with pretty visuals, it's that kind of rinse of repeat gameplay that you'll have to die again and again till you memorize the patterns and understand how to avoid the death traps, it can get boring after a while, unless you play it on occasions everynow and then.  6/10",
