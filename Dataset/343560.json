Graphic :  Is beautiful and enjoyable to the eye, It surely brings refreshment to platformer titles.  Sound :  Music is cool and energetic that follow's the gameplay.  Gameplay :  Game will require from you to sharpen your platforming skills before you can beat the game, nevertheless even if you suck at it you will enjoy it.  Tutorial is very helpful so it is recommended to be played. Controls are simple and wont give any hard time to beginers. Level design's are beautiful same as they are challenging.   Random sentances: This game is firstborn child of father Super Meat Boy and mother Speedrunners. Single player is fun, but full potential lies in multiplayer up to 8 people! It will give you a damn much fun. There is maybe possibility that you can broke joystick or keyboard playing it. :D Didnt encounter any bugs or glitches, and game runs smooth.  Highly recommended to platform lovers, and gamers that are looking for challenging game.  Ok, enough of me, now go out there and have fun.    Game on, ZemunBRE",

I really love the visuals and the soundtrack, everythings really pretty, and the sounds are awesome.  EDIT: Meant to put my gripes with the game, sorry. The only thing I don't like about the game is that it can get a tad bit repetitive.   Overall, I really love this. Totally worth your time. 10/10",

I buyed it with 95% discount, but this game is worth even without the discount.  10/10 Would die again.  ",

There's a wide variety of terrains Bob must cross, in order to get his food. With, or without condiments. I have played through some of the game, but I decided to give the ILs a shot, and with that there are many different tricks you can use to optimize your time!  Bob Was Hungry is a nice addition to Shorebound Studios' already neat game collection, and I'd recommend to anybody who enjoys difficult platforming! 9.5/10",

            "review_text": "Having played and enjoyed multiple 'hardcore' platformers like Mr Bree, giana sisters, etc, I had high hopes for this game. Unfortunately it didn't deliver. This game has basically no story, and has you play ~ 20 levels on 5 worlds. Its a platformer where you navigate around traps and die with one touch. This would be fine, but then the problems set it. Each level has you begin from start if you get touched, with no checkpoints. Games like this should utilize checkpoints, and ones that don't only do it to force increased playtime and cause frustration thats supposed to be fun but its really just lazy game design. If you navigate a really hard precise section or 2, then die at a part you haven't seen yet, you shouldn't have to play those first 2 sections, thats just dumb bc you've beaten them. The problems escalate when the devs choose to instead of making different, varied traps with different difficulty, they constantly force more precise and perfect jumps, forcing you to do ~4 different sections all with tiny gaps and spikes and traps on all squares except 1, which is just a sign of laziness. Some levels where its 14 seconds it ok to have no checkppoints, but others that are 45 seconds its stupid. The other problem is they start forcing you to do levels where everything is single crumbling blocks, not letting you plan moves or have down time between things, so that 1 mistimed jump the whole level is over. Then later on in a really dumb decision they make you start collecting things all over the level to beat the level, some of which are up in weird corners surrounded by traps you would normally not have to go to. Collecting should only be optional, but once again its designed to force you to fail. In other levels the lack of clarity on where you should go screws you. On 1 level I hit a switch and could go backwards or continue along and up, with no idea, and since this was late in the level, it kept screwing me bc I didn't know the right way to go. This is bc some paths are to optional collectibles, which shouldn't be the case, as they should just be along the way or clearly visible. Other parts throw things together like crumbling blocks and shots coming at you from off the screen. These parts are super stupid because they are all about chance and timing. You have to jump to the next blocks hoping the shot isn't there and if so you're screwed. It just about what time you jumped on the first of all the crumbling blocks, and you can potentially be screwed from the start, which is just dumb because you can't do anything about it.   All this precision and forced repetition wouldn't be so bad if the controls weren't off. They aren't terrible but they need to be better for what the game asks. Your guy is a ball, and instead of moving along regularly, he rolls in short abrupt bursts, and not in a steady rhythm. When stuck between things and moving with them, this can screw you. When jumping, the platforming is floaty. The biggest problem is he accelerates to the side super quickly. you will pres over and jump a little without the sprint button, and he will go flying to the side, forcing you to hold back. This leads to multiple deaths and is imprecise. Other times you will land on a single block and bounce off, or slide off. This leads controls to feel slippery. This also occurs when trying to wall jump off blocks or walls. The hitboxes are off many times too, as you will be slightly below something and it still counts as you getting hit. The other problem is how imprecise the jumps can be. You will press jump the same way multiple times, and some times you'll go up a little bit, and other times you'll go to high and hit into something. Things only get worse in the later levels, and instead of changing things up it just requires more perfect jumping and tons of it in a row or start it all over again. with the finnicky imprecise controls it just becomes frustrating for the sake of it, and at least 50% of the time it doesn't feel like your fault you died.   Go get one of the games listed above or many other good ones on steam instead of this.   3.5/10.",
