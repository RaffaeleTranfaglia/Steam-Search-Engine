            "review_text": "  The key for this game was indirectly given to me by the developer for review purposes but it will not change the tone of my review     I will start off by clearing the misunderstanding of the phrase “A dungeon crawl where YOU are the dungeon!” Speaking frankly, this line is by far the worst possible way to describe a tactical turn based game, especially a one like this. Do not think that you will get to set up your own dungeon, build defenses, place enemies and traps to stop heroes from reaching the end goal because you won't. Rather the phrase is supposed to imply that you as the player summon a horde of minions to fight against heroes hired by the Red Queen, which can be seen as a nice twist.  Reverse Crawl as mentioned before is a turn based game in which you play as the “Revenant” King revived by his daughter, a necromancer and the “only” survivor of the assault by the Red Queen on her father’s castle. Your main goal is to defeat the Red Queen, hence to reclaim your kingdom.  You get to recruit many different types of minion groups which you can summon to fight for you but there is a limit to the amount you can summon which depends on each chapter. By gaining experience (either by defeating enemies or using spells) you can upgrade or gain; spells, minion groups and abilities. This freedom of choice adds a lot to the game. The battles carry out as all basic tactical turn based games, either move a minion to an adjacent space to the target for melee units or attack from a range for ranged units. Tactically the game rewards you with bonus flanking damage. With one of the newer updates a skill tree has been added which gives perks to your minions.  I can’t say much about the story without spoiling it. The events that happen in each chapter depend on your choice for example you can either try to get new minions or get a specific item to improve a minion group/character or gain new abilities. These events lead up to 3 different choices before the final chapter, i.e. the showdown with the Red Queen that affect the ending. As the choices vary with your decision it adds replayability to the game. The achievements for these branching paths are relatively easy to achieve so this game even it doesn't appeal to you can serve as a perfected game in your library.  The art style for an Indie game is actually quite good, being quirky and funny at times. The character's especially the Revenant King have odd personalities which might appeal to you based on your preferences. However, don't expect to take the story seriously which should be made apparent by the artstyle as the Almighty Revenant King can sometimes even act like a child. All in all, Reverse Crawl is a great game for $6 though I must say it is short, excluding the replay value with the branching story.",

(I personally really like their style) In my opinion the description about 'you are the dungeon' and fighting 'pesky heroes' is not how I would describe this game at all. You are clearly the 'good guys' and the heroes that you fight come across as more powerful enemies.",

The fact that you are able to overcome enemies with hordes of disposible minions, gives this game a unique feel that is different from most tactics games that I have played. I quite enjoyed summons large numbers of weak skeletons to swarm my foes, particularly unlocking the 'Sacrifice' command later in the compaign (which allowed me to instantly kill any of my weak units for a boost to my more valuable minions).   Overall, Reverse Crawl was a great value for the money. I got more enjoyment than I expected from a game whose list price is under $6!",

            "review_text": "Reverse Crawl is a simple game to learn yet, there are definite, strong ties to strategy in this simplified, turn based strategy game. The storyline isn't bad either. A bumbling daughter wants her daddy back and viola! He's now a zombie king hooray! Hilarity ensues and you get to pick and choose from line ups of monsters you want to summon to represent you in battle. Even if you don't like any of the line ups with their possible stat buffs and debuffs inflicted on most units, you can reroll for new units to use three times before your stuck with those units. Including, yourself and your daughter as well as others you might encounter who will lend you their powers and prowess if you do the right missions. That's the other cool thing, the missions are not all encounterable in one playthrough so you have to play many multiple times to see all the missions there are to achieve at. The graphics are top notch for what the game is and the game play is simple and intuitive. Easy to grasp in other words. If you're looking to get into turn based strategy games, this might be the one to get your feet wet with so to speak due to its simplicity and its appeal from the beginning tutorial which is short by the way, to the harder missions and decisions. For six bucks not on sale but it is right now for four dollars and seventy-nine cents, it's a steal of a game and a great way to kill time and actually think about what you're going to do.  Graphics: 9 Gameplay: 10 Replayability: 9 Learning Curve/Ease of Learning: 10 Overall Rating: 9/10",

My one gripe was reading the description I was immediately interested in endless mode once the game is complete, anything endless is always good to me - I was upset to find that it was in fact just one endless battle with wave after wave of enemies to defeat to set a high score - I wanted a true endless mode where I could get more and more monsters and upgrade their abilities and powers. So one slight downside.",

This is a fairly easy yet quiet enjoyable game, although a bit short. The battle system is done well, as is the overall system of upgrades and choices for the story line, which are chosen/made at the end of each chapter or level. The game has a good deal of replayability, and an endless mode for after you have beaten the game. Overall, I would recommend getting this game. It is addictive and can easily soak up a couple of hours of time, or for those who want every achievement, a full day and then some. Don't buy this looking for a challenging RPG or TBS, buy it because it is easy yet enjoyable while retaining the concept of strategy.",

When a siren takes control of a homuwhatever, and kills the mage that summoned it with it, the game breaks. An easy fix is just aborting the quest and starting over, but it's annoying to have to do that at the end of a mission, especially with the lack of checkpoints, and if that mage was the las enemy. Oh well, besides that, I've found nothing wrong with this game at all, and even with the small amount of time I've played, I already love it. RPGs are my favorite, so it's nice to play one that's so unique, playing from the opposite side of the story. 8.5/10",

However, I beat it in 3 hours, in one sitting.   I repeat, this game is only three hours long.   I wasn't going any faster than what felt to be the natural speed of the game, so if you play it slower, you can probably get four hours out of it, but if I was to replay it, then it'd probably only take me two hours. It does have New Game +, which is very good, since it gives it some replay value. Since you have some choice in what missions and upgrades to take, and which ones not to, there is some replayability, but you'll end up doing a lot of the same missions, New Game + is a bit lackluster. I would have prefered many more missions, but it's six dollars. Is it worth $6? Sure. It's mechanically sound, the graphics fit, and, all in all, it's a short and satisfying game.",

For that price you get a fun little tactical game with seviceable art and music which will keep you entertained for a couple of hours (usually 5-10 but your mileage will vary).   Pros:  *cheap price *low specs (your potato computer can run this *Turn-based strategy with the ability to upgrade units on a tech tree *Campaign is on the short side (around 3-4 hours) but you have a new game plus and endless mode for replayability *Art style is cute, I like the aethestic a lot  Cons: *The title and game description is TOTALLY WRONG, don't buy this expecting a dungeon keeper-style game I don't even know why the dev called it reverse crawl you are definitely not the dungeon don't believe the game description LOL. It's actually your typical turn based strategy fantasy story except you lead the goblins and skellies instead of knights and paladins.  *The story is non-existent, even the 'plot twist' is something you can see a mile away. Also I didn't really see any branching path except for the ending and whether an annoying opponent keeps appearing or disappears completely.  *Music is nice but you only have like 3 tracks, it gets samey after a while  Final Rating: Worth your purchase, this game is one of the better indie games out there. And for the price what have you got to lose?",
