Bought the CE. Have a GTX 1080, but a few hours in and the game is unplayable. Even at medium settings and 1080p, it stutters like hell. I even tried locking the game to 30fps but the frame pacing is such a mess it still feels awful.  Such a shame because the game seems to be fantastic outside of its horrific performance. I have tried ever recommended setting and fix I have found. Nothing works :(. I hope this is fixed soon.   Also, the image quality is pretty poor. Even at 4k max settings, the image is very soft. Things look blurry, especially in the distance, even with depth of field turned off. Distant object s have terrible aliasing too, even with TXAA.   Once patched and running well I will change my review.",

I'm not refunding because I still have some shred of hope for a fix. Let's hope two more weeks don't pass without some kind of update or Arkane will have sold me a 60 dollar Game-Crash simulator.   I'm beyond disheartened.  EDIT 12/5/2016, 3:42 PM: I installed it on my buddy's computer, a big beefy machine, and it has some stuttering issues and the mouse feels a tad wonky but it's a good game.

            "review_text": " 12/2/16 Patch 1.3 Update :  The game runs better than it did after a few patches but it still features unacceptably poor performance. So as of now, I'd still advise people to stay away from it.  I've since been able to add some stability by turning off SLI and switching to windowed mode at a lower resolution with V-Sync on. This seems to have alleviated a lot of crashing issues so far, and performance hovers between 40-50 fps. It's at least playable this way, but I'm still experiencing the odd crash and performance still randomly tanks in the sub-20 fps range for no discernible reason, resulting in gameplay gaffes and general frustration.  I'll fully revise this review once I finish the game and a few more patches have rolled out. But as of right now, it's a still a thumb's down due to its horrible performance. What a huge disappointment.   Original Review :  Stay far, far away from this one unless you like wasting money.   After just a couple of hours I've been absolutely plagued by freezes and crashes. Not sure what's causing it, but they're pretty frustrating. They occur randomly in-game, but the game also has a bad tendency to crash out of even a menu.  Additionally the game runs really poorly on my hardware to begin with. I'm running an i7-4790 with 780ti SLI on an SSD, all my drivers are updated, and it still runs terribly on even the lowest settings. It's not even so much that I see a low framerate -- Even though I certainly do, I'm averaging about 35 fps overall on medium settings -- It's that the framerate fluctuates wildly for seemingly no reason. For example, I'll play through a certain area and see around 45 fps, then quick reload because I screwed something up, and play through the same exact area averaging 28 fps. It makes no sense. And toggling graphics settings seems to help nothing: I get maybe a 5 fps variance between the lowest settings and putting everything to high. Something is severely wrong with this game, and seeing how broken it is removes almost all of my hope that it'll ever be fixed. From what I understand it even runs poorly on consoles: I've seen many complaints about crashes on the PS4. So maybe this is a Void Engine thing, I dunno. But I sure wish they had just built Dishonored 2 on the Unreal Engine, like Dishonored 1 was.  This is the worst running PC game I've played since Assassin's Creed Unity's release back in 2014. I'll update my review should this game ever stabilize, though even that is no guarantee. Once a game releases in this bad of shape it's rare to ever see it run well.  Now we know why Bethesda didn't want to ship review copies to journalists covering the game. Because it barely works. Shame on you Bethesda for such shady business practices, and shame on you for releasing a game with so much potential in such a sorry state.",

            "review_text": "So a couple of days ago I got this game with the current discount that Steam offers (33% off) I thought frankly the game wasn't only incredibly badly optimized, but also it was a boring and dull experience, I didn't experience crashes or anything of the sort, but I did experience framedrops on the second mission during the infamous intro sequence as well as when staring down towards the city from the balcony.  I tried every setting imaginable and I just couldn't get a playable framerate, I tried everything I could, but for my standars, (which are high because I guess i'm a jerk) the game was just unplayable, it drop to the low 40 fps with some settings set to the lowest that they could get, in other cases the game just simply refused to stay above 30 fps, and so on and so forth, after having a confusing, and frustrating experience, I pretty much just refunded the game, that was of course until today.  I found a deal for the game at a 'legit' website (according to a Bethesda representative that hangs around some forums on reddit) and whooptie doo, here we have my review. And I managed to fix my performance issues, How?  Welp...  i5 6600k gtx 970 24 gb of ram  Those up there are my system specs, not to shabby, not to incredible, in my honest opinion, just a decent enough build.  I first disabled vsync completely, it turns out the input lag as well as the fact that it's the type of vsync that imposes double buffering, an uncommon form of applying vsync now a days, usually games use triple buffering without even telling you, to my understanding the simple rule of this to forms of vsync goes like this, double buffered locks your framerate at the half of your monitor's refresh rate, so if my monitor has an hz of 60, the game will simply lock my framerate to 30.  Triple buffering fixes this, but sadly it introduces an absurd amount of input lag, so the only solution for this was to disable vsync completely, something that both fixed in it's entirety the issue with the input lag, as well as the framerate issue, for the most part.  The second thing that I did was to set the game at the 'default settings' meaning to have the game running at the recommended settings that the game offers based on my system specs.  It appears it set everything to the 'medium' preset, the game looks good, nothing spectacular, nothing ugly, just good.  And... That's pretty much it, the game now runs and plays just fine, I just finished the first two levels and I felt the need to give a write up for this, maybe I experience problems at a later date, I hope not, but there.  DIshonored 2 as a game, when talking about the core, of the story, of the gameplay, of the actual experience, it's an absolute masterpiece so far, and i've put in maybe around two hours or so, with the first one being the one that made me slap my head and refund the game, and with the second one being one fueled by my curiosity as well as by my care for my limited income.  And i'm glad in all honesty that I purchased the game again, I really enjoy it, but that's not to say the game doesn't have it's fare share of problems, the game is plaguated by performance issues across all systems, for what i'm reading.  Maybe I could recommend it for people that don't mind dropping the settings down a bit, nor do other people that maybe don't mind playing the game at 30fps just like the rest of the platforms do, overall tho, I really hope they fix this on pc, because what i'm experiencing now, after a lot of trial an error, and just a lot of pacience and tolerance, is not what the regular buyer needs nor will it do, in most cases people will simply forget about the game and move along, and for a game that was clearly made with this much passion, with as much attention to detail, and with as much care, I frankly don't think it's fair, not to the consumer, and not to the creators themselves, to have them releasing this much of a broken mess.  Even then, i'm recommending it, because in my experience, is a great game, incredible really... If you can get it to play.",

Mouse sensitivity/acceleration is very inconsitent, even with smoothing and friction off. It's uncomfortable and needs a fix asap  Gameplay is fun with some complaints, but I'm giving this negative due to Bethesda's anti-consumer practices like not giving review copies, and the numerous issues at launch.

I go into the settings, set everything to ultra low, I'm now looking at a 'stellar' 50-60fps (barely). My performance should be through the roof on ultra low and yet it's as if I've only gone from ultra to high or very high.   Sensitivity and leaning are weirdly implemented and do not feel right.

The patch they've released two weeks after launch now still isn't enough to make the game play like it should.   In closing, save your money.

My playthroughs were done leisurely as well, collecting all runes and bonecharms, doing all side quests, and reading through the plethora of notes and books in game. I can only imagine how much shorter it would be if NOT taking your time.  The game has some serious technical issues, terrible optimization and a lot of graphical glitches. I can play any other new games like BF1 on medium settings 1080p res and get 45FPS on average. This game I cant even maintain 20 FPS on low/medium settings at lower resolutions. The game also has really wierd visuals, objects and things get jaggedy and the AA goes crazy when they are further than about 15 feet away. The edges get jagged and blurry and it just looks like crap, but those same objects look great when your up close to them. I dont know if thats from the game itself or a product of my visual settings, but I hate it.  The gameplay is GREAT and its so much fun which is why its such a shame that the game suffers from so many issues and a dreadfully short play time. The powers are a blast and sword fighting is exhilarating. Both Emily and Corvo have their own unique magic and skills and it lets you play your own way, stealthy or assault style. The plot is decent although feels like its taking a few too many pages from the original game. The typical political coupe or overthrow and the missions are the same, basically kill this person.   The first dishonored was good but I felt like the Devs couldnt find another gameplay loop, they couldnt build the missions around anything but kill this person. And every mission your out to kill someone else responsible. Theres maybe one or two where your doing something different but the basic layout is hunting the people responsible. Kind of shallow, but overall it works for the most part.   I feel very dissapointed. Maybe ive been spoiled by all the great games recently, but personally I think 10 hours for an RPG is unacceptable. Its just too short. Ill get maybe 30 hours of gameplay out of this game before Im completely over and burned out of it. The Witchers DLC Blood and Wine provided me with TWICE the play time, and that was just DLC. I hate to compare games like that but my point is in this day and age, the way games are, this is just short, plain and simple.  WAIT FOR A SALE, this was not worth $60 in my opinion, not even the preorder bonus of getting the first dishonored, not just because I already had it but because even the two games together in my opinion are not worth $60.  I was so excited to play this, counting minutes on store page on release day, and now a mere 48 hours later I cant even play it anymore, Ive done 3 playthroughs now, and its just not fun anymore because Ive done everything so many times. This game is depressingly short, makes me sad :(. I dont get how it took them so long to develop and make this when its such a small game.",

I spent an hour of my 1.4 hours in this game fiddling with the visuals and mouse settings thinking it was my setup, but it isn't. The frames drop harder than Skrillex bass. Everything is great whe you're standing still but as soon as you move the mouse to look left or right, frames instantly drop to about 15 fps in my situation. Also, the mouse does this weird thing where at the start of movement, it moves really slow, as if in syrup, then immediately zooms right the hell away lightning fast meaning good luck trying to aim accurately at anything ever. Arkham Knight was terrible but it was blatantly obvious with the frame drop. This does it in a way that is almost inperceptable. Like I said, it seemed like it was something that could be fixed by lowering a few settings, which is why it took me so long to realize it was the game, It literally made my head hurt. When I finally threw in the towel and lowered everything to the lowest setings possible and still had Skrillex level drops, I headed straight here to see reviews. I will wait a few days to see if this is patched, before deciding on wether i need to return it or not. I was seriously looking forward to this and the game mechanics and story themselves look like they'll be great, but I need to be able to play this without getting a huge migraine.

On the one hand, they did crank out the patches pretty fast. On the other hand, the game still sufferes from poor performance. While I can play it, having to use medium settings on a 980 and still get performance issues is pretty bad.   But it does look like Arkane is trying to fix the issue. Ideally they should have done this BEFORE they sold their game to customers, but that ship has sailed.   Still can't fully recommend the game though, while now playable it still has really bad performance.  E2: Patch 1.3 is available in beta today.

I got even more hyped with the gameplay shown at Bethesda’s E3 2016 conference. I let myself get so hyped for the game that I even bought the collector’s edition (Its funny how the last three games I got the collectors editions for were dissapointing.) And so when the game arrived at my doorstep I loaded it and got to playing… and was greeted by a myriad of technical issues. I find it strange that Arkane of all companies would release a shoddy PC port, considering their first game was exclusive to pc and their second ran perfectly. Of course I was so determined to still enjoy the game that I continued on, 15-20 FPS be damned. After forcing myself through the game by sheer stubbornness, I left disappointed, not just by the buggy state of the game but also by the lackluster writing, pacing, and poor delivery from the vocal talent. Yes, some of the voice actors do an alright job, but the others leave a lot to be desired. Its also baffling how quickly everyone jumps ship to Delilah’s side at the beginning. You’d think that after the first Dishonored everyone wouldn’t be too quick to decide that Corvo was behind the murders after having been framed before, but oh well then purpose of the plot what not.. And the pacing is just terrible. In the first dishonored it took a bit before everything went to hell, yet in Dishonored 2 all that happens before you’re kicked from power is a cutscene (which you can skip by the way,) excluding the optional tutorial. The dialogue feels a little stilted and awkwardly spoken in brief phrases, and most of the nonlethal eliminations feel wimpy and underwhelming.    Hell, you non lethaly eliminate Delilah more or less the same way you did in the Daud DLC’s, and just trap her in another one of her paintings    None of them (save one, Jindosh) feel like a cruel mercy, where killing the target is far nicer than the alternative. Most of the levels are forgettable. The first and last level in the game are the same map, just different in appearance. The only two levels that feel memorable are the Clockwork Mansion and a Crack in the Slab. Gameplay wise Corvo’s powers feel superior to Emily, at least when it comes to stealth. Aside from that the gameplay is still as smooth as ever, so that’s a plus. Ultimately I left feeling disappointed. If you liked the game, cool, more power to you. As for me, it just didn’t connect. 5/10, I suppose. EDIT: Also it uses DRM.",

I still find more and more things on it.  Dishonored 2 feels distant to that.  Like super distant so far. Dunwall felt bit more intresting. Voice acting instead of 'mute' character is so and so. At least its not Jennifer Hale and Troy Baker all over again. New skills are awesome (Emily) and choice between 2 people is great addition!  My enjoyment of the game would be much better if the game wouldnt look like pixelated mess (to make the game run more than 20 fps). I dont have 'the best PC master-race rig' so I've come to expect a bit performance issues but this really hurts the immersion and enjoyment. And I run games like Doom just fine.   Its finely crafted game with amazing effort put into it on everything else than performance. Levels, gameplay, world details, different routes. All great. Gameplay: 10/10 - a bit same but with new things and feelings. World has more civilians that try to live normal lives etc, feels more liveful than dunwall.  Screenshot tool (nvidia only): 10/10. EDIT: Removed on patch due some reporting it causing performance issues with no way turning it back on unless you use 3rd party software. Bleh.  Performance: 4/10 - Not as bad people make it out to be, but not as good it SHOULD be. Its not Arkham Knight level of disaster (for me), but it sure aint fun.  Again, Bethesda has been screwing around and putting money to PR rather than issues it has.  I love Arkane but it really shows they ran out of time. Patch that fixes lot of issues THIS SOON is really shady to me. Its almost like they knew the game would be in this state and the patch was 80% ready for launch in few weeks afterwards. Patches usually take long time to come up with, I sadly doubt that you can wind up patches in few days and push it out public without testing.

However, on a system build that can run games like DOOM, the Witcher 3, and Titanfall 2 on mostly Ultra settings (with some Very High settings enabled, and Hairworks turned to the Low preset for the Witcher 3- which still looks amazing) all running at 55-60 fps, I can't run Dishonored 2 above 30-40 fps on meduim- low settings and sometimes lower in open scene areas. It's shameful that companies treat groups of customers like this these days but it's becoming more of a common trend. The game is horribly optimized for PC and the patches they've put out do little to fix the overarching issue. Don't buy until the game is fixed, basically, but I hope they fix it because I loved Dishonored 1 (I still gather for whiskey and cigars on a regular basis) and I desperately want to play this game the way it's meant to be played. Knowing the companies involved however, probably means that this will never be fixed the way that it should be or if it does get fixed it will be half-♥♥♥♥♥ and incomplete. A shame, really, as I was looking forward to this game for a long time.",

The big deal here is that I basically bought a GTX 1060 this year for Dishonored 2 and Mankind Divided. While MD worked great at High/1080p/60FPS, Dishonored 2 was completely unplayable and so that is extremely disappointing to sink money into a new card only for the game you're most excited about to basically not work. It was beyond the framerate issues, some kind of micro stutter, smeary/blurry turning, glitchy textures under some lights, and the audio issues were really bad. The whole thing was such a mess and the first patch took awhile to get out, I can just tell that this thing is going to need a LOT of work and probably won't be good to go until months later. I'll wait for some more postive reports in the future and for a sale.   Be very weary. Consider yourself lucky if this game runs decently for you. You've been warned.",

From the streets of Karnaca, through abandoned solarium, Rubik's cubish Clockwork Mansion, the beautifully moody observatory, to gloriously handled time travel..Dishonored 2 kept surprising me. There is also one thing improved from the first game that made me very happy - both playable characters, Corvo and his daughter Emily, are voiced and actively talking. So no more artificial mute monologuing with other people like in the first game. Maybe a sign of the dumb 'Silent Protagonist' trope dying off? I hope so.  Anyway, masterful experience, can be replayed many times thanks to the wealth of possibilities. Tech-wise, looks beautiful and ran perfectly fine for me (60fps, 2500K/1070/8GB).

            "review_text": "The performance of the game is surprisingly lack luster. I had an R9 280 and I pretty much had to run this on low everything to get a decent frame rate. I ended up deciding to do that overdue upgrade and picked up a GTX 1060 6gb and there were times when this game STILL ran as low as 10 fps in complex environments, though with settings maxed out completely. For the most part it cruised along at about 30 fps. Meanwhile, COD Advanced Warfare was well over 60 fps, consistently, Mirror's Edge Catalyst is well over 60 FPS, consistently... Clearly bethesda and arkane did not do even a decent job of optimizing this for the PC market. and that sort of sheer negligence speaks about the companies which throttle a game's success. However, being a big fan of the first game, I decided to be a big boy and get over it. Once you can get past the performance problems (if you are capable) then the game itself is quite good.   The overall story isn't bad, it's fine. Once you clear the intro to the game, you can pretty much figure out the final outcome. There are some great concepts they flesh out during the game, and a few points where they give the player a surprising amount of control over the immediate plot if the player thinks ever so slightly out of the box and off the game's 'rails' (the dust district mission, and the stilton house... that's all I'm going to say).   The amount of thought put into the different elements of the environment is impressive. The amount of detail in every aspect of the game is great, and there's huge amounts of lore to track down and enjoy. The clockwork mansion had elements that were surprisingly well thought out for an FPS as well.  The gameplay was great. If you're a stealth game nut like me, you're going to love this. Arkane did a great job of making you feel like an assassin lurking along rooftops, rafters while stalking your target and avoiding detection. If you're not a stealth nut, then the combat is still pretty fun. I played through the game twice, once good and once evil, and both paths are equally fun. The exploration potential in the game is huge as well. I got bored with exploring considering how much time I spent at it, and upon my second play through I still found areas I handn't seen yet.  Sound and music were well done, no complaints there.  The endings were a bit short and felt a little lack luster. Like, you could more or less predict what was going to happen once you had made decisions, and even then I was surprised that some of the decisions I had made had no bearing whatsoever on the ending. It felt like this was another area where things felt like they didn't get enough attention, but it could also be that the creators didn't want to broaden the potential endings so dramatically that a third potential game would have to ignore many of the outcomes and stick to a very specific cannon outcome. Whatever the case, I was actually a bit disappointed in the endings I was able to explore.  Overall, I do recomend this game, though I strongly caution players to research their GPU's ability with the game, and do NOT expect the same performance you get from other games with similar visuals. The R9 280 chugged pretty hard on this one, and ultimately this was the catalyst to go for a significant upgrade, and even then the game had moments of surprisingly low performance. Do your homework, check your gpu to see what it can do especially in the complex environments and decide what you're willing to accept. If you can do that and you find yourself at peace with your expectations, then get this game because it's really well made. ",

As though sensitivity went from 15 to 200.  The first game's movement, actions, and mouse control were all much smoother. The new 'Void' engine has completely screwed many of most basic parts of a game, movement and action. I'd have been much, much happier and more satisfied if they had kept the original engine and smooth performance.

I built this PC in the summer of 2014, it plays Overwatch and Titanfall 2 fine. While playing the game it occurred to me that I wouldn't be able to play it without stuttery issues so I was slightly disappointed, but I persisted. Combat is very laggy. At first I thought that my PC was outdated, but I ruled this out. I took apart my rig and dusted pretty much every component, thinking that heat had something to do with it. I took the CPU fan off and noticed that the paste was a little dry and thin, but in general my CPU performs pretty well and doesn't heat up much at all. I also flipped my power supply so that the fan pointed upward, hoping that it would draw hot air down from the other components in my case.

While most people will shout negatives at this game on steam for performance. The only negative I have with the game is that it's not 'Thief' enough. The sound design is not as good as the Thief series and that is integral to a First Person Stealth Sim like Dishonored wants to be. The fact that sound does not matter until 'Very Hard' and even then it's not really a true mechanic is quite puzzeling to me. The only other negative I have is that I cannot retract Corvo's blade and use it as an equivalent to the Black Jack from Thief. I am fine with choking people out but the fact that it's almost my only option to knock people out is kinda lame IMO.   Before I move forward with my review I would like to say that if they make a Dishonored 3 PLEASE give us that choice. I think it would be cool to be in situations where some guards have metal helmets, so that, I have no other choice BUT to choke them out. Then a lot of guards would be wearing hats or nothing at all and I could just run up to them and bop them on the head. It would be so much more interesting to me from a gameplay perspective.Then If they also made sound matter imagine having to worry about being on Marble, Stone, Metal, and anything that makes a lot of noise. Those are the gameplay elements of Thief that I loved to death. Jumping down from above onto my Moss Arrow patch and then smacking a guard on the head. It was seamless gameplay, no context sensitive BS.   Anyways, sorry for that loooong tangent but it had to be said. Overall I DO LOVE this game a lot. It and DOOM are my favorite games of the entire year. The performance issues on my end have been completely ironed out. Plus, I bought it on sale so not having to pay that full sixty was definitely a plus. The game definitely captures MOST of Thief's style. It's like 80% there. Stephen Russell voicing Corvo alone is literally enough to bump that up to 85% if I'm being totally honest. Just like Thief and Garrett of the past Corvo will comment on things around him and make witty quips. The dialogue is pretty damn good so far and I would say it's pretty on par with Thief. This game was my dream come true in a nutshell. I totally say give it a shot if you loved Thief.",

If you finally get this game to run properly, you'll realize that the map designs are quite clever. Just like the first Dishonored game, there are multiple way to get to your goal. Also, you 'can' hack and slash your way through everything, however, you won't live very long if you go that route. The stealthy and deliberate approach is the best route to go. Overall, it's a pretty FUN game. It's just too bad the devs didn't give as much loving attention to the PC version as they did with the consoles.",

What I can say is that if you were a fan of the original game, Dishonored 2 improves on nearly every aspect of Dishonored. The option for high and low chaos is still there and both can be played either in a more action or stealth mode but added to this is the choice to play as either Corvo or Emily. This is not merely a choice of skins as Emily's powers are different from Corvo's. Corvo's is consistent with the first game but Emily offers new powers like Link (what happens to one linked enemy happens to the other(s)); Doppelganger (creating a duplicate of yourself for distraction or fighting purposes); and Shadow Walk (taking on a stealthy shadow form to move about more discreetly). Also, the game adds the ability to break down normal bone charms to create custom charms with multiple traits. Dark and corrupted bone charms can be sacrificed for material but the traits which they held will be lost.  The best feature of the game though is the level design. Dishonored had some great levels, but Dishonored 2 has levels equal to the first and two levels that are among the best in gaming. If you are someone who does not explore levels but simply follows the waypoints to complete objectives there is a lot that will be missed. I'm sure that type of player will find some enjoyment in the game but where the game shines is in exploring the hidden away spots and seeing all the detail that was included in the level design.   Story-wise the game draws a lot from the two story expansions of Dishonored (The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches). You don't need to have played these to understand what happens in Dishonored 2 but those who have played the expansions will have more background on a couple of major players. The story also expands the world of Dishonored as most of the time is spent in Karnaca instead of Dunwall. As in the first your actions will affect some areas of the game, with high chaos leading to more blood fly (the equivalent of rats from the first game; though rats are present here as well) infested areas.   Three games really shine for me this year: Doom, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, and Dishonored 2. The first two seem like worthy titles in their respective franchises. Doom returned to the feel of the first two games and added some elements that made it a lot of fun to play. Mankind Divided was a great sequel that was the equal of Human Revolution. But Dishonored 2 took the step up to the next level for that franchise for me. For that reason, it's my favorite game of 2016.",

Game seemed fun for all I played, felt just like dishonored, a bit sluggish but that is probably due to the framerate halving at times.

Just playable: it still suffers from occasional stuttering and crashes, but it's occasional at best so it can be overlooked.  I have done a little non-scientific and non-statistically relevant research among my friends, and it would appear like the way to max performances on this game is not to buy a top-of-the-line GPU but a top-of-the-line CPU: we've seen builds with a GTX 1070 where the game runs like crap because the CPU was 'just' an AMD FX 8350, and builds where the game runs smooth as butter with a GTX 760 and an Intel i7 6700k. So it looks like the game relies a lot on the CPU, maybe too much.  As I said, it's not really statistically relevant, but maybe worth considering. I still don't recommend it, based on the fact that they released it with basically ZERO QA for PC, we (the players) had to beta test it as they patched it (and they still are patching it), they didn't release the minimum requirements before releasing the game, letting many people who preorder it unable to play it because the game supports only SSE4-enabled CPUs, and they basically made a poor port from the console version while still denying it was a port (proof that it's a port? the mouse controls originally felt and behaved like a controller's analog stick, plus framerate capped at 30 or 60 only).",

The ingenuity behind the level design is astonishing. I haven't encountered a game offering so many routes to objectives with such intricacy. Exploration is very rewarding - although the storyline is linear, the scale and detail of the maps makes the game at times feel like a sandbox title. The graphics, although arguably technically not the best to date, are absolutely beautiful, with particular attention paid to clever lighting, shading and use of colours. If you enjoyed the first game or you enjoy challenging stealth titles, Dishonored 2 is a must buy.  The performance issues appear to have been resolved with one exception. I would strongly recommend to Nvidia users disabling HBAO+ in advanced options - as with a lot of other titles (GTA V, Far Cry 4 etc.) it really does kill the frame rate. With the GTX 1070 I can play the game at 2560x1440 at a mix of Ultra/Very High, TXAA and adaptive resolution disabled and the performance is flawless. HBA0+ was enabled by default however and I found the game very choppy before disabling it. The graphical difference without it is marginal, you won't miss it.  Edit: Having now completed the game I can reiterate that it was truly excellent, definitely game of the year for me. I have had no performance issues whatsoever since disabling HBAO+.

As of patch 1.3 (almost one month since release) there are still some weird graphical issues going on but it seems mostly smoothed out if you fiddle with the settings enough. I managed to get stable framerates at 1080p by locking the FPS to 45 and turning most things up to very high. That being said, the game shouldn't have been released on PC as it was. A delay would have been preferable. Arkane and Bethesda messed up.  As most reviewers have said, I'd probably give the game a thumbs up if not for the state of the optimization. It's got a well built world to play around in and the NPC's are less rigid than most other games. They seem to be a living part of the world rather than just set pieces. The dialogue can be a bit cringe at points, but it's rare enough to be forgivable. I had a few frustrations with the control scheme at first but it's definitely workable. Overall it's an enjoyable experience if you're a fan of the stealth genre or the world of Dishonored.  As for the graphics, it's a pretty game. It really is. Is it the prettiest game of 2016? No. Battlefield 1 is by far better looking and Titanfall 2 (made in heavily modified Source, btw) is as well imo. Opinions over art style will differ, but in plain graphical fidelity it's pretty handily beaten by other holiday releases. The issues people have had since release are not because this is a new AAA game with the fanciest graphics to date that require a beasty GPU with 6-8gb of vram to run, it's because Arkane chose to cannibalize the ID Tech engine and turn it into the Void engine. I assume because it was at hand and saved on licensing fees. Wrong move on their part.  If you really wanna give the game a shot I HIGHLY recommend waiting for a sale or picking it up on console. Definitely don't give Bethesda/Arkane your $60 for this either way. They knew the state of the game when they released it and took advantage of Bethesda's new day 1 review policy to push it out the door anyway. I regret buying at release and being too stubborn to return it while I had the chance. By this time next year it'll hit less than half price in Steam sales and (hopefully) be properly optimized. This will definitely be my last day 1 purchase from Bethesda for a long time to come.",

Made by God himself,handed to Arkane studios and published by Bethesda, this game is a truly masterpiece.",

I have a top end rig and I still dip below 60fps  gtx 1070 i5 6600k 4.5ghz 16gb ddr4  I have a 144hz monitor so if you own one, might as well lock it to 45 fps or something cause that's how low it gets it most of the time when you have to do actual gameplay like run away from enemies or blinkd around. Absolutely atrocious optomiziation, and to be frank; the game doesn't look good enough to justifiy the ♥♥♥♥-pooor performance. There is an amazing game undernear all this negativity, but the optimization is just unacceptable, specially if you own a decent system.   my opinion of the game will most likely drastically change if the framerate issues get fixed.  pros - Still the great dishonored world/gameplay you expect  - AI is a lot better and more fun to experiment with  -Difficulty is harder(due to AI being better), making the powers not feel so overpowered as of yet  cons - Terrible mouse controls. Even at 130fps in some areas, it feels like the game is running at a much lower framerate  - Terrible optomization. Looking round a microinch will drastically change your framerate from over 90 to 40 on regular occasions  - The game blatantly has false recommended system requirements",

Final thoughts I did one playthrough as Corvo on medium difficulty, but I kinda just went straight through the story. I'm doing a second playthrough as Emily, and while my first playthrough was fun, if you take your time and look around it is a lot more fun!   If you cannot accept bad performance, wait a week or two after launch and buy it then. I enjoyed the content of the game itself enough to get past the technical issues.

I believe the game itself performance aside is amazing, However for me, the performance is such a big hindrance that it makes the game difficult to play or give a good review for. Until a patch which makes noticeable different to the performance I highly recommend you avoid as I've decided to stop playing as to not ruin the core game with shoddy performance.   There are several areas in the game where fps will just sink and no amount of fiddling with the graphic settings will give you any sort of gain, you will sit at 20-50fps regardless. Additionally, mouse sensitivity seems to be highly controlled by frame rate, at 40fps there is notable sluggishness and when your frame rate jumps back up your sensitivity jumps way to fast leaving this horrible inconstant motion regardless of smoothing is off.  Other issues include render distance clipping, horrific AA solutions (Off, FXAA or TXAA x1 which makes your game blurry) and notable stuttering at any FPS even above 60fps.  My specs:  Monitor: 2560x1440 60Hz (Issues are reported at 1080 also) GPU: GTX 1080 Founders Edition Memory: 16GB DDR3 CPU: I5-4690k @ 3.5GHz Stock  I'm also using the latest 'Game Ready' driver from Nvidia for Dishonored 2 and it makes 0 performance difference from when I ran without it. User's are suggesting fixes such as setting gpu to use Prefer maximum power, pre-rendered frames to 1 and turning VSync on. For me this doesn't help.  Positives:  - Game is generally nice to look at, I've seen better but its a noticeable improvement to Dishonored 1 for me. - Game play seems to be a general improvement of the first. - More paths in levels for you to take. - More interactions with NPCs - Larger levels.  If the game gets a good patch soon I will probably change my mind if they can get a consistant 60fps and fix the mouse issues, until then though I won't play. Unfortunately due to buying the game through Green man gaming so I cannot refund it.",

If you doubt the severity of my claim, open up the Dishonored 2 streams on Twitch. Not even the professional streamers with multi-thousand dollar rigs can run and stream this game at anything above what I guess is low-medium settings. While I understand that meeting deadlines across many platforms is insanely difficult, this looks like a pretty clear case of an unreasonable deadline that should have been shifted back months ago to allow for minimal QA on the port.

Aside from the frame issues which will be eventually patched, Dishonored 2 blows every game I've ever played out of the water (and I've played just about everything). There is so much detail put into the game world; you can see how weathered the walls are with their scratches and marks, there's tiny notches on the wood doors, scratches and marks of your metallic sword (with realtime reflections), the scars on the NPCS, the ebb and flow motion of the water, and the gorgeous color scheme of skyline and shadows that reflects the time of day, etc. It looks freaking amazing. The game doesn't try to be photorealistic and improves on the art style from the first game. The dialogue from distinguished voice acting cast and animations are superb, the gameplay is open ended, and there's so much to explore that I know I won't be able to see it all in one playthrough. Its story and gameplay is done really well, a rarity as most games will do one portion effectively yet neglect the other.   If you're a fan of the Bioshock series, Thief series (excluding the 4th one), the first Dishonored, Deus Ex, or just love atmospheric games that focus on lore then this game is for you. Just keep in mind that this game is a bit demanding on the pc as even I get the occasional frame drops while running on a high end card. GOTY for me.  TL;DR -Performance isn't that great atm but patches are underway  -Open ended Gameplay+immersive story are amazing -Looks absolutely fantastic -Can and should be replayed due to different endings depending on your decisions  Edit: I just tried the beta patch which is set to release around sometime this weekend. FPS performance has improved dramatically for me and the mouse issues are gone. Also to the misinformed people writing reviews that keep saying this is a port, no it is not.

As a preface, I had none of the performance issues experienced by many people, so I cannot comment on that, purely on the game itself when it's running fine. I understand that some people are having trouble even with hardware that should be fine, but on my end I had smooth &gt;60 fps the entire game. Whether I'm just lucky or not I'm not sure, but it worked great for me.  Dishonored 2 really expanded on the story of the first game, and kept the really weird techno-fantasy setting on the first game going strong. The levels are full of intricate things that are so alien yet so consistent that it feels like a believable world, and the Stranger and the Void are always interesting every time it pops up.  As for the gameplay itself, I really liked the way it always felt like I had options. I chose Corvo at the beginning, and mostly played through stealthily, the only kills I got were a couple of unintentional ones where I accidentally left an unconsious guard in a puddle of water, and when an enemy got knocked off the side of a building by my sleep dart. None of the missions pigeonholed me into making a choice I didn't want. Even one mission that at first seemed to require the death of a faction leader eventually opened up to reveal a third option as I looked around the area.  The levels themselves are all great in this regard, always unique from each other and each having all sorts of different ways to get through them depending on what powers and such you're using. Especially noteworthy is the clockwork mansion, which I won't spoil but when it all first starts moving aorund it's just really intersting to get into. At no point during anything did it feel like a chore, and I honestly can't think of any spots in the game I didn't like.

I wish I could, it has so many great elements and a lot of promise, but they are easily overshadowed by a large amount of truly baffling technical issues.  But to start off with the good things:    You get to play as two characters this time around, and you get to pick. They differ in details like their powers, but this difference leads to rather large changes in how you traverse levels and handle combat or stealth.    Stealth is more satisfying this time around, seemingly buildings and spaces have been set up with greater care to provide more of a puzzle. I play on hard, and I've been killed a fair few times for not planning things out well enough.    Story seems interesting so far, always a plus.    New settings compared to the first game. I mean in the end the world is just as screwed up there as in Dunwall, but the change of scenery is quite cool.   Now to the bad parts, and as I said, they easily eclipse the above. This is based on the 1.2 beta patch, performance is much worse without it:  For one, the optimization is  terrible , and that's putting it very very mildly. The game runs alright on hardware which should make it soar. And even then constantly stutters or drops frames in seemingly random situations.  Next up, someone implemented  negative mouse acceleration . This really only makes sense if someone is playing with a touchpad, even with a controller it feels mushy and weird. They ought to just remove it entirely instead of trying to tweak it like they did in the patch. Or at least explain why they'd even have this, it serves no purpose in a FPS.  Third, the options are just broken. Toggling bloom also toggles screen dirt and lens dirt effects? Setting textures too high results in them loading at lowest detail? Lots of settings having absolutely no effect on framerate? Most not even on visibly quality? All there. Also ofc the staples of 'modern' interactive movies, forced film grain effect (cannot turn it off), ridiculously overdone motion blur, depth of field despite already blurring everything with FXAA or TXAA, bloom so strong it feels like your monitor is acting up. At least other than the film grain, you can turn these off. Still, this is a video game, you'd think the effects were optimized for it, not for a movie.  Fourth, because this really bears stating again: The game looks like something from 2014, and runs like something from 2030. There's no excuse for this, and I just cannot recommend getting it.

They've done a great job fixing the graphics problems although it took some time. After all the patches I can't really complain about the performance issues anymore.

            "review_text": "I caught the game on a Steam sale and decided to jump in, regardless of all the bug reports. I can only report on my experiences:  1) The gameplay is outstanding. Take Dishonored 1, improve your non-lethal combat *extensively* and you have Dishonored 2. Now you don't have to sacrifice having a good time because lots of the 'fun' gameplay is lethal -- non-lethal is viable and just as fun.  Right now I'm on my first playthrough with Emily and her powers are interesting. Cool stuff. I'm looking forward to trying Corvo's different powers (haven't even seen them yet).  2) Graphics -- They are really good. More actual detail than the first Dishonored and even more 'dense' - It can take hours to explore a particular area because there are so many nooks and crannies.  3) Sound -- The sound is very good, with environmental sounds and great (non-intrusive) music to back it all up. The voice acting for many of the characters, though, is absolutely comical, in a bad way. They really need to look into hiring some better voice actors for the normal enemies - heck, I'll offer my services for free.  4) Game performance - So I use a 960GTX on a Xeon (i7) 3.5Ghz and performance is acceptible if I turn off V-sync. V-sync does some weirdness -- slows down the mouse response, everything feels like it's 1/10th second 'behind' my input. Of course, I have to live with the tearing, but overall it's much better to have some tearing and great responsiveness.  Frame-rates go from 70-30. Usually, even in the 30FPS areas (dense with lots of objects and enemies) it still feels pretty good in actual gameplay, but there are some quirks (mentioned later in bugs).  5) Bugs -- Unfortunately, the game is fairly buggy, but so far (thankfully) not game-breakingly so.  For instance -- you can craft bonecharms or runes, which is awesome -- and you can even stack effects on bonecharms to have them stack.  Except the beneficial traits (like choking someone out or moving with a body) are DETRIMENTAL -- Arkane made the ridiculous mistake of flipping their logic, so that equipping a 'Choke someone faster' charm (or 4) will slow your choke speed....how disappointing.  As for graphics - mostly stable, but sometimes I run into craziness -- I'm playing on Hard, so about 2 hits from a sword kills me (which I like) but when I bring up the powers menu to try to select a power, sometiems I'm 'stuck' in that I can't select a power----I have to press escape to try to exit the game, then try to enter the menu again. Really annoying and has led to several deaths.  Overall -- An awesome game if technical issues don't plague you -- I run on decently high settings and love the graphics -- can't wait to upgrade my GPU and play on higher settings eventually.  The level design is absolutely awesome -- Clockwork Mansion being something I've never seen in a game and the design is almost mind-boggling.   I really hope they fix lots of the bugs though -- some of them are so easy to spot and yet they made it into the game.",

            "review_text": "This game is absolutely amazing. My experience with it so far (across my 2 playthroughs) has been one of the most enjoyable experiences ever in a game. The game recaptures the same charm that the original Dishonored had, and it expands upon it.  I have played two playthroughs, the first being an Emily low chaos playthrough, and the second being a Corvo Flesh and Steel High Chaos playthrough.  Emily as a character works really well, from what I've played of her. I am planning to do another playthrough with her where I actually utilise lots of her powers, which I couldn't do because I was trying to maintain low chaos. My first playthrough took about 8 hours, and I feel it was mainly that I had to reset to try and maintain ghost status, which I later gave up on as it was frustrating me. They said that the A.I was significantly improved upon, and it definitely shows. The Low Chaos ending is also quite good.  I would imagine that Corvo would be very similar to how he was in the first Dishonored, but as I played Flesh and Steel mode, I wouldn't know. What I will comment on, however, is the care and effort Arkane put into making this game enjoyable while playing Flesh and Steel mode. They put in the effort to make sure there is always some way that you can achieve your objective in multiple ways, even without the use of powers. The level design is amazing and I give props to Arkane for putting lots of love and care into their game.  The story of this game was more complicated than the first, but it expanded upon and continued the series in a logical way. It continues on from the DLC's of the previous game, so I would advise playing those first. The cutscenes are done really well, and they give good background information as to what's going on.  Now, I didn't have any performance issues with this game, so I can't really understand why that's happening to some people. I'm running the game at above 60FPS with a GTX 1060 6GB, 16GB of RAM and an i5 6600k.  Overall, I'd say that this game is worth a buy, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first game, or who just wants to get into a game with some good replayability and some excellent stealth/murdery gameplay. I give Dishonored 2 a 9/10.",

            "review_text": "Dishonored 2 is exactly the sequel I wanted. Unlike many other newer games, it feels like the developers were left alone to just make the game they wanted, as there are no microtransactions, no multiplayer, and no cliffhanger ending with delusional aspirations to make this a huge franchise. This is just as tight and focused as the first game. The few problems are either technical, or the same things the last game did wrong.  The biggest improvement in Dishonored 2 over its predecessor is how the developers have learned to marry player movement with the level design. This is something they improved on with the DLC for the original, and here they’ve refined it further. It’s what makes the level design stand out compared to other games of this type, as they haven’t used your athletic abilities as an excuse to turn it into an open world game. Instead it has the small scale focus of Thief, Deus Ex or Hitman, with a movement system that makes it feel like you can go wherever you want. Obviously, with double jumping and teleporting, there needs to be barriers. But the developers have done a remarkably good job of designing natural barriers around the levels that don’t break the illusion of it being a believable world. This isn’t like Battlefield with its “leaving the combat area” notifications, which are probably the worst way to do it.  There are two playable protagonists this time, which is something that works nicely with the kind of game this is. The game allows a refreshing amount of unpredictable chaos to happen in the levels. When you start a mission, guards and NPCs all wander around on predictable routes. But interesting things start happening when you poke at their routines. The game allows guards to follow you across the entire level, and if they lose sight of you, they don’t immediately return to their old positions. This opens up possibilities for all sorts of guerilla tactics, as you can lead them on a wild goose chase to the other side of the map, and then return to previously guarded areas and loot them while they’re still busy searching for you elsewhere. I haven't played something this willing to let complete anarchy spread inside its levels since Saint's Row 2. It's a kind of game design I wish we'd see more of. So even though you play through the same missions with both characters, this is a game where replaying doesn’t feel like a waste of time.  Even though levels are segmented into separate zones, they don’t “feel” like game arenas. For example in Thief 4 and the last two Deus Ex games, levels were subdivided into smaller arena sized areas for streaming, which is something Dishonored 2 doesn't do. Instead the game has pretty brutal RAM requirements, with the benefit of more interesting design. There’s such a density of optional content and alternative routes that the environments gain a sense of naturalness most games don’t achieve. The art direction also manages to meld characters and interactable objects to a cohesive whole, to the extent where it can be hard to see where enemies are, and what you’re able to pick up. In a slow paced game like this, that's a positive, as it encourages you to stay on alert at all times, as you’ll otherwise miss how a room can be swarming with traps and enemies. It also makes the game look more like concept art come to life, as the graphics aren’t overloaded with thick outlines and spotlights telling you what you’re supposed to look out for. This isn’t the most technically advanced game to come out this year, but it’s easily the best looking, as the artists used the tech to its fullest. The balance of colors and dynamic range is near perfect, creating a style that will age marvelously.  The chaos system returns, changing the ending of the game based on how many people you kill. I didn't like how the system worked in the first game, but here I found it alright. The two playable characters have personalities that fit one or the other approaches better. Emily is being slandered by political opponents, who accuse her of assassinating her rivals. Playing her as a killer feels like you'd be playing into the hands of her critics. But if you play as Corvo, you're basically Liam Neeson, making it perfectly in character just to murder everybody. Playing as Emily, I bent over backwards finding solutions to knock out enemies instead of killing them. For example, if I was discovered, I jumped up on shelves or lamps to do leaping knockdown attacks, often managing to take out entire groups of enemies. And even if a few people died, either by accident or by me running out of patience, the system isn't particularly harsh. You have to kill more than 10 people per level before you're classified as high chaos.  As for the story, it's a mixed bag. The voice direction in key emotional scenes is poor, and the characterization is generally flat. Take Emily Caldwell. Even toward the end I had no idea how she had been managing as an empress, or even a basic outline of her personality. Everything pointed toward her being totally incompetent, and I’m not sure if that was the intent? In cutscenes she talks about things she’s learning, and how the journey has changed her, but it feels unnatural and forced. This story isn’t nearly as good as Thief 1-3, but it thankfully isn't a trainwreck like Thief 4. The story here does the job alright, about on par with the last game, but it isn’t memorable in the least. Almost all dialog felt more like filler than a real story.  It’s too bad the story is so-so, as it doesn't feel like it went anywhere interesting with its characters. It puts more of a damper on my feelings about Dishonored 2 than the game deserves. But you can’t underestimate how big of an emphasis we put on how something ends, without it being something we have conscious control over. Still, I can only see it as a huge positive that I’m genuinely considering playing it a second time. It's one of the best designed games I've played this year, and I like it more than the first one.",

Very cool. - The ability to play lethally or non-lethally and offering up very creative ways to get rid of a target.  Cons  - Performance issues, I have a high end rig but even ran into the occasional lagging points myself. I imagine on even a moderately built PC there to be performance issues too - The story, I am keeping this spoiler free but lets just say the chances are quite high that you will enjoy the little stories told as you go along rather than the main over arching story. - Bugs bugs bugs! If you're trying to go for a shadow achievement or a no kill achievement be careful where you rest bodies and be sure to regulary check the menu that the game hasn't accidentally ticked you off for something you weren't aware of. Very frustrating - The game really tends to teach you that killing is bad, I feel that it really caters towards the non-lethal stealth approach but of course you can be a killer too.  Overall  I recommend this game as it is a big improvement over the first Dishonored, the feeling I walked away with was that I got to enjoy a good experience and remember more of the side missions and explorative parts then I did the main storyline.  This game gets compared to Thief a lot however I don't think that's accurate as this game really focuses on assassinating targets (either lethally or non-lethally) and you play as a bold and almost heroic player, saving this person or seeking revenge on that person whereas Thief was more about stealing valueable items to pay rent, score a favor with a fence or to keep some faction off your back and most importantly trying to stay out of the spotlight. Garrett and Corvo are very different characters, both enjoyable in their own way but I wouldn't call the games these characters are from all that similar just because D2 has Stephen Russell and you can stealth.",

I myself highly anticipated this game; I own Dishonored 1 and both of the story DLC and had a blast playing through all of them.  However, as others have said, this game runs terribly on PC. My setup meets or exceeds the minimum requirements for this game and is near the recommended, yet -- even on the lowest settings -- the framerate seems to regularly hover below 20 fps and the mouse movement is rough and irregular. Once you reach the game's first open area, even turning reduces responsiveness and makes things run jaggedly. I even waited to try agin until after the recent 1.2 patch, and, while it does seem to have helped, it's not enough to make the game enjoyable to play.  This game is supposed to give you the feeling of stealthily and speedily moving across rooftops and pouncing on unaware guards, yet the performance issues make it feel like your character has Forrest Gump leg braces, instead. It's suprising to me that Bethesda -- once a publisher that dealt exclusively in PC games -- now has given only cursory review and effort to the PC ports in favor of console releases. Hopefully, over the next few weeks there will be more patches that bring the performance up to snuff for PCs meeting the requirements. Until then, this game is -- disappointingly -- Not Recommended.",

If you were hoping the AI would be less erratic, or there would be more weapons for a lethal approach, or the guards would stop repeating themselves, none of that has changed in any significant amount. If you've never played the first game and don't know if you liked it or not then you should probably do that first, because the plot of 2 doesn't coddle players who think it's acceptable to start a series with the second entry, so if you haven't played the first game and its DLC storyline (which is especially important) you might not appreciate most of the characters as much. If you liked Dishonored 1 and want another game's worth of it, go right ahead, if you have the hardware to run it. The optimization isn't unplayable, but it seems to be very picky in which computers it will run on and which computers it will barely start on, and while my 970 and i5 3570k @4.4 GHz was able to run it at mostly max settings at around 60 fps, others with similar hardware have barely managed to reach that on low settings. I'm submitting my recommendation as positive because the game itself is great, but I hope Bethesda learns a lesson from the rest of the recommendations burning them at the stake to not try to release your game a day early if you aren't going to properly optimize it. The 'preorder and get the game a day early' scheme is the worst preorder idea I've ever seen and should've died with Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, and maybe now it really will.",

From the opening scenes of the game I was pulling fps ranging from the high 20's to low 40's, and that's with half the settings on very high rather than ultra. There is NO way this game is more graphically intensive than the latest Deus Ex game, which I can run very smoothly at 45-60 fps with a mix of maxed and high settings.  After noticing the poor mouse movement and framerate issues, it was a serious blow to first enter into the open'ish world only to encounter pathetically bad lod meshes. Other than some superior lighting and shadow, visually this game is a pretty big step back compared to the first game. Trust me, the moment you leave the beginning area you will be shocked at just how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the gameworld looks.  This game was clearly made for consoles, with pc's receiving a very poorly optimized version. The art direction alone REEKS of console limitations, which reeks even more of the game being rushed, or the developers being lazy in not implementing proper graphics scaling options to account for pc capabilities. Parity across platforms has it's limits.  Do yourself a favor and either refund this game or sit on it for awhile until it gets better optimization.",

Length: It has taken me 26 hours to complete with Corvo, going stealth. I consider this value for money. I am currently going through it again as Emily doing a high chaos (full on 'kill them all!') approach.  Performance: I had some bad performance at the start but the beta patch eliminated almost every issue I had, FPS was up and everything seems okay apart from the occasional crash now and again but I am sure it will be sorted once the patch goes live.  Detail: I have thoroughly enjoyed Dishonoured 2, I love the stealthy gameplay and the powers, like the original, add a lot of options and ways to deal with the various situations you find yourself in. There is nothing quite like being surrounded and stopping time, killing everyone, then starting time again. Or using your powers to ghost through a level, never being seen. The stealth gameplay is the best I have played and the story had me interested from start to finish.  If you choose to not go the stealth route, I think you will be left unsatisfied. This is because the devs haven’t designed the game to be anything but a stealth game. So, this means your foes will never get the drop on you, they will always be on their predictable set paths and because the levels are designed to allow you to plan your approach, knowing what you are getting yourself into before you act, it is all too easy to kill everything that stands in your way even without using powers. Even if an alarm sounds, everything will be back to its predictable default if you go away for a bit.   The game never really puts your foes on edge, never prepares them for the threat you represent. There is a level where the target you must get to knows you are in the building but does nothing to hamper your progress. It all feels great if you are stealth but way too easy otherwise. Now throw in the powers and you are basically a god amongst mere mortals who couldn’t really care less and will happily go about their duties waiting to get ganked.  As a solution, it would have been good to have the level adapt to your approach going off your previous level behaviour. If it is clear you are on a rampage, like I was killing over 100 NPCs in one level, then surely the next level the guards should be unpredictable, more numerous and actively seeking you out? Rather than standing guard and talking about having whiskey and cigars tonight.  My advice is to go stealth on your first playthrough then try a full-on assault playthrough next but bear in mind it is so easy it gets boring, even if you choose not to use any powers, they simply wont see you coming.",

Story 10/10 so far amazing Characters 10/10 already in love with Corvo all over again AI 10/10 It's more intelligent and more interactive with itself  Please give this game a chance, it's a gem that's being destroyed by impatient reviews and an audience that doesn't appreciate the new console/PC war that's been going on for over a decade.",

A lot of my experience up to now has been marred by performance issues and I can only now start to enjoy it for what it is. The stealth is pretty good, and difficult enough on Hard, Emily's powers are fun to use compared to Corvo in the last game. Plot wise, the set up is a bit stronger, however it still has the issue of introducing characters in the same mission you need to do something about them.  As of the most recent beta patch 1.3, the anti aliasing is much less blurry and the game maintains 60FPS on High about 80% of the time. Bought it elsewhere sadly, and still wish I could have refunded it and bought a patched version in a month or two. Maybe the Corvo playthrough will change my tune.",

I've checked through forums and requirements needded, and I reach all of those, the problem lies with it's port. I usually play on the lowest settings, providding the best possible frame rate for me, and even then it looked like I went into Fallout 4, put the game on ultra settings, spawned one hundred Albino Deathclaws, and tried to look to my left. I coukdn't deal with it after a while. I would say, wait for the game to get it's patches, if you already bought the game and you're just browsing reviews while you wait for the download, refund it, or don't play it for a while (if you don't think it will work, refund it before your 2 hour window or your 2 week limit) andd test it later.

BUT after the first patch sorted out the fps issues the game opened up into what Dishonored should be.   Positives:   + STORY: Obvious, but enjoyable with great returning characters and references to the first game.   + LEVEL DESIGN: Is back and is great with so many different ways of completing a level. (Clockwork mansion and Dust district mansion being standout levels).   + ABILATIES: So many different ways of using the powers you're given to neutralise targets and traverse the environment. (I love Domino, such a great idea).  + CHOICE: the choice to play as Corvo or Emily, the choice to build the powers how you want to match your own playstyle and the choice to go lethal or non-lethal.   + GRAPHICS: I can see some people not liking the graphics or the art style, but for me I think they suit the world perfectly.   All-in-all despite the initial bad launch with bad fps (which was sorted out for me in the first patch) Dishonored 2 has built on the very strong foundations that Dishonored put in place with a unique world, great level design and multiple paths of completion. When I think of what I wanted in a sequel from the first game I wanted one that: continued the story of the characters, visited new parts of the empire and retained the best gameplay elements.   If you loved the first game then you will find all you need in Dishonored 2, but be prepared that your machine has to be a bit beefy and accept that you will still get frame rate drops in certain areas.

Personally, I was able to fix mine and start running at my own's reccomended settings after downloading the latest drivers.  The game itself is fantastic. It takes everything from Dishonored and simply improves on it, including a sort of 'Karma Chart' to keep your Chaos level checked in better fashion, more fluid and persistent animations/movement, better powers (as well as improving on the best aspects of Corvo's ability set), and a story that suprisingly tips its hat hard in the first game's direction.  Unlike a certain, very illogical sequel in recent times, Dishonored 2 starts the game fifteen years after the LOW CHAOS ending. It also has heavy story tie-ins to the Brigmore Witches DLC, so I would heavily reccomended going back and playing it if you own the Definitive Edition of the first game.  Overall it's a blast, whether you play as Emily or Corvo. There appear to be no cutbacks in the way of alternate pathing, but I'm certainly anxious on whether they've fixed how Low Chaos/High Chaos endings work in regards to having bounceback opportunities with the Karma Chart (a major problem with the first game, where it was advertised heavily with using all your powers and gadgets in mind. Because killing more than a handful of people lock you to High Chaos, it felt like you were being punished for doing what was advertised).",

Yes, at launch it was unplayable for many people due to a bad PC port, but the patch which later came out fixed that, at least for me. It is entirely playable on my medium-low end laptop, alebeit only on medium graphics. Obviously bad launches are not to be encouraged, but considering the sheer unadulterated quality of this game, a little forgiveness is in order.   I'm going to keep this as brief as I can. The story is excellent, the world is atmospheric and well designed. The combat may be too simple and easy on lower difficulties but on harder ones you are forced to get creative and it becomes much more nuanced. Emily and Corvo both had different and equally fun sets of abilities, although one or two don't feel very useful, although that is partially matter of playstyle. It is a fairly short game, taking me only about 12 hours on my first playthrough, but it is exceedingly replayable. There might be three or four differant ways you could approach a given situation and it always feels fresh. As soon as I finihsed my high chaos playthrough as Emily I started a new one in which I plan to never be seen and never kill anyone, and after 5 hours it still feels fresh. I love that it lets you play the whole game without once killing an enemy, if you so chose, or lets you slaughter every single person in your path, and both feel equally rewarding.  But my single favorite aspect of the game is the level design. Every mission is large, explorable, and unique, usually with some twist or added mechanic. In one mission dust storms will occassionally blow through reducing visibility. In another, you make your way through a huge mechanical mansion which can transform as you pull levers. You can even slip out of the usual areas and make your way through the spaces between the shifting walls. In another, you have the ability to jump between the present and the past, solving puzzles by changing things in the past to affect the present. Every level is full of detail and atmosphere, and you are heavily encourage to explore them to track down runes which allow you to gain more abilities.   It's just all so well put together, every part working together to create a functional moving whole. Dishonored 1 is in my top 10 games of all time, and Dishonored 2 is right there next to it.   9/10. The single significant problem I have with it is that you are apparently expected to read more journals and books and listen to more audio logs than I did initially or the story doesn't quite make as much sense as you'd expect. Also in the time travelling mission there is no way to carry an unconcious guard back to the present, which I would have found hugely amusing.",

            "review_text": "  [THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS]  After all of the negative reviews I've seen for this game, I'd never think that I would enjoy myself playing this more than the original dishonored, which is one of my most played stealth games on steam, but somehow I did.   I praise the decision in bringing back characters such as Delilah into the series, as I loved the Dishonored 1 DLCs Brigmore Witches and Knife Of Dunwall, both for attention to detail and character development, as you explore new areas from a completely new perspective. I did feel as if Delilah did deserve more time in development and this game was more than enough to satisfy this. The antagonist Delilah is fleshed out spectacularly throughout this story, along with some of my favourite twists to the dishonored franchise so far Delilah is Jessamine's sister who was cast out of the tower and left to poverty, with the false promise of the throne, and Meegan Foster being Billie Lurk.    The developers really upped their game in terms of their level creativity. A few that stand above include levels such as the Jindosh Mansion, a house filled with walking death traps, levers and puzzles, all while being disturbingly watched by the Grand Inventor as he detects your every move. It's challenging, complex, atmosphere, intense and in my eyes, one of the best designs for a Dishonored theme, Closely followed by maybe The Flooded District, which was one of my favourite settings through both of these games.   I feel as if life in the city was highly improved, with the idea of more civilian conversation, more areas where people could lay low, along with more dilemmas such as wreckages, abandoned homes etc. This was a large improvement from Dishonored 1 as while it did have some social dilemmas, it doesn't compare to 2. Along with being able to hear different opinions of situations going around them, for example, the two woman discussing the speech of the overseer during the Addermire mission.   While I did find the voice acting of The Outsider to be a strange change, I got used to it around the 7th Mission and was able to see his effort in filling the role was well done. However, in terms of the Protagonist, while I do find the addition of the character being able to give input on a situation, I feel like sometimes it was unnecessary, but I found it to be satisfying during story based events rather than minor things such as Object Activation, such as globes.   Also, small things such as glass panes and objects being more of an obstacle really helps with the realism of stealth and also makes you think before you decide to far reach straight into a window and think you're gonna be silent.   I was able to run this game with my 750ti and my Intel G3258 at low settings with the addition of max textures, for details and such, and was able to keep an fps of around 45-60, with the exception of getting close to gravehounds, which would affect it severely, but not for long. Overall I would give this game an 8/10, I would be more inclined to give a 9, if it were not for some glitches concerning certain power combos like domino and the affects you put with it, along with some glitches concerning detection when loading into a game, but sometimes with enemies detecting you almost instantly, even if they have not seen you once.

It's your decision to try them or not. - keep your drivers up to date - scale down graphic settings to the performance of your system - reduce the resolution to a reasonable Setting - don't get your PC cluttered with useless GFX and performance 'optimizers' - and so on  ... and you will have no/fewer problems (up to the limits of your system).  perhaps you should consider optimizing your system: - Get more RAM. Runnung a Titan with 8GB of system RAM makes no sense. - try not to overestimate the limits of your system. (a second monitor alone halves the performance of your GFX) - buy the correct RAM for your Board - buy the correct CPU for your GFX Setup - and so on...  Perhaps the Performance Issues mentioned by others here are truly an game-problem. If this is the case, it will be fixed. To help the devs to do this, tell them (with exact problem description and diagnostic informations).",

            "review_text": "As a fan of the stealth genre, and with having taken some of my first stumbling steps many a year ago in the classic Thief franchise, Dishonored came almost out of nowhere and picked up the torch that seemed to have been dropped somewhere around the dawn of the new millennium. When the brand new Thief game turned out to be somewhat of a letdown (although I enjoyed it for what it offered), the hopes were high that Dishonored 2 would be able to keep carrying the high level of quality of both it's inspiration as well as it's own original game.  Not only does Dishonored 2 live up to my expectations, it even picks up some pieces lost in the near-death of the Thief franchise. None other than Stephen Russell, the original voice actor of Garret, the main character in the original Thief games, provides the smooth strokes of Corvo Attano this time around. On my first playthrough I simply had to keep playing as Corvo, partly because I grew so fond of him in the first game, and definitely because he now practically embodies everything I loved about Thief.  The gameplay is smooth and responsive throughout, with a plethora of ways to go about your business. As a stealth buff, and someone who loves games where you don't need to kill a single soul, I opted to do the Ghost and Clean Hands playthrough (never detected, no kills), and thus heavily invested in the stealth and traversal skills. The signature ability is definitely the Blink, allowing you to teleport a short distance, and it has seen a small upgrade taken from the DLC to the original game where you can now pause time while aiming your Blink, even in mid-air, allowing for some ridiculously cool moments.  Visually the game also stays strong, keeping with it's somewhat water-color inspired aesthetics from the original, albeit now in a souped-up id Tech 5 engine. Without a doubt, this is a gorgeous game. The level design is also superb, with wide open and often times very vertical maps filled to the brim with secrets and treasures for you to loot. I would definitely suggest you take your time going through it, both to soak in the visuals as well as to experience some of the hidden corners of the world.  But let's not avoid the elephant in the room: The performance. A lot of people have been having trouble running it, and while I can say that I was one of the lucky ones in that I had very little trouble playing the game, the state the game was released in was bad for many players. A number of patches have already been deployed, and I have seen a performance increase on my side as well, so the developers are definitely showing that they care about this fact.  Remember: A game with poor performance can usually be fixed, but a game that is just bad can most often not.  The bottom line is that Dishonored 2 is a fantastic game, bolstering great gameplay, superb world building and level design, and some absolutely spectacular visuals. To top it all of, it keeps carrying the Thief heritage with both pride and dignity, and I hope that this is not the last we see of this world.",

            "review_text": "---------------------- Story/Lore (SPOILERS!) ---------------------- Very insuring lore and very nice steampunk theme. The world has mass amount of lore behind it with such things as diseases that occurred during the times, famous people that made very futuristic things, and stories on what happened to people in that time era. The story happens about 20 or so years later after the first Dishonored so expect to play as Corvo or Emiley and not see one of them for most of the game, because you have to pick one. The story does not best the first but is still a very good story with interesting characters and enemies, cool interactions with other NPCs and constant interactions with the Outsider. There is more to be told in this game about the Outsider more than the first had which is quite good for the lore.   8/10 For Lore and Story Telling ---------------------- Gameplay (Hard Difficulty) ---------------------- Very similar gameplay to the first with harder stealth that filled that gap it had in the first one. New types of enemies which can not be stealth killed (Clock Tower Soldiers) and depending on who you pick between Emily and Corvo your powers. Between Emily and Corvo's Outsider given powers they have similar ones (Blink, Dark Vision, Validity, Shadow Kill exc.) but also a lot of different ones as well (Doppelganger, Stealth Form, Far Reach, and Domino) while Corvo has his classics. This game can be played how you want to be played and it says that in the game it supports stealth to full out just sword and gun fights. The stealth is a little better because you can now kill enemies over cover and under cover such things as the first did not.   9/10 For Gameplay ---------------------- Graphics/Optimization (Max Settings) ---------------------- This game has a very colorful and beautiful city and is easy on the eyes. There are not a lot of extra Nvidia Workshop settings you would expect from a Nvidia sponsored game but there are some. The port however is yes you guessed it ♥♥♥♥ at the moment but I am not marking down the score for that because they said they are fixing the problem soon. The graphics on everything look well detailed and very well textured, very smooth and has a cartoon like theme to the graphics which works as well. The models I do have to say look a little weird in my opinion. It's just the way they look such as their bodies and faces but its not bad, just the artstyle. 8/10 For graphics (Port is going to be fixed) ---------------------- Final Score:8.3 Should have added some new gameplay mechanics, but at the end of the day still a great game for the series. ----------------------",

Long form: The two things that I would point to that show this game building off the first one to make it better are the expanded skill trees and the improved non-lethal combat. This for the most part gives players greater freedom with their play style. In the first Dishonored if you wanted to play a non-lethal run though you had to stealth past everything, if you ever got into combat it was kill them or run and hope you can hide so the NPCs give up on looking for you. In the second game you are now able to dispatch NPCs with non-lethal take downs if you end up in combat. This is only one small example but it goes to show that they took the time to see what systems of the game needed to be changed without creating a completely different game from the first one. I personal think this game will play well for those new to Dishonored and those that played the first game.",

That being said, I will be reviewing this game based on MY experiences only.  So first off, lets address the performance issues. For me, The performance was ok until I hit the main city, but after searching a bit, I found a fix for NVidia users to basically disable Nvidia's unoptimized turd known as Ansel. This boosted my performance massively by 30-40 more fps. For a while, the Mouse Input was absolutely horrible, however with the new beta patch, it has been pretty normal. Arkane should be putting out a performance patch in the coming weeks, as well as adding New Game+ and other features. That's pretty much it for the performance side, runs pretty well for me on the following specs:  i7 6700k 16 GB DDR4 RAM EVGA GTX 1080 FTW  (Using 1080p monitor, so I can't speak for performance on 1440p)  Alright, now for the actual game. The short answer is: this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece. The story, in my opinion, was fantastic. I feel that this was one of the few games that lived up to its predecesor. Couple the story with amazing level design, and you have yourself a fantastic game. Not only is the game good, it also looks like a painting. The art design team really out did themselves, and how Dishonored 2 wasn't nominated for GOTY in Art Design is beyond me. Similarly to the first game, Dishonored 2 has insane replayability value. Since you can play as both Emily and Corvo, you essentially get 2 playthroughs (thats not including low chaos, high chaos, no kill, etc playthroughs). If I recall, Polygon complained that Dishonored 2 had horrible voice acting. In my opinion, the voice acting was nowhere near horrible. Infact, I rather enjoyed the majority of it. It's nice that Corvo finally has a voice actor so you are no longer a silent protagonist, even if Corvo says some pretty obvious ♥♥♥♥ sometimes. Another thing that really stood out to me in Dishonred 2 was the combat. Somehow they managed to make Dishonored's combat even better. The gore is also 10x better than the first game. Skillwise, Corvo's skills are identical to the original game's skills, with some new upgrades. I cannot speak to Emily's skills as I have not done a playthrough with her yet.  Overall, I feel that Arkane did a really good job on this game, but was ♥♥♥♥ed over by Bethesda pushing for their release date. Quite a shame that the game had to suffer a terrible launch because of an overzealous publisher.",

            "review_text": "After 57 hours, 5 playthroughs and unlocking every achievement. I feel I have a good enough opinion on the game.  Dishonored 2 is a perfect sequel for my personal favourite game. It has built well on its gameplay with the introduction of two playable characters, each with their own power sets and the lore of Dishonored has been greatly expanded on with some questions left on the first game being answered. Yes there is performance issues but this can easily be fixed with some messing around in config files and video card settings. Or just wait for the upcoming patch.  Story: (SPOILERS FOR STORY INTRO)  The start of the story is weak, very weak in my opinion. We start off as Emily on her throne giving a speech on the 15th anniversary of Jessamines assassination from the first game. The first gift giver of the day is the Duke of Serkonos who was brought along the 'true' empress, the sister of Jessamine. The claimed rightful heir then announces she is the heir to the throne and she will be taking it and locking up Corvo and Emily and just like that most of the guards just turn their swords on you. No proof needed, a strange women with a distorted voice and questionable clothes comes in and says shes the true empress and everyone just believes her and pulls their sword on their empress of 15 years, it doesn't make any sense. The rest of the story makes up for this as you embark on another journey to get to the bottom of a plot against your empire, There are some good points in the story where we see revelations and parts where plot points come together and I felt myself drawn more into how this coup was formed. It creates a new feel for Dishonored, while not straying too far from what made the original great.  (END OF SPOILERS)  Gameplay:  Gameplay is just so close to perfection, the game's difficulties have actuallly been worked on to make a difference other than how much health you lose to hits. I played on very hard and being stealthy has never been so hard, enemies are so much more perceptive and I was as good as dead whenever I accidentally entered an enemies central vision. If i mistakenly entered an enemies peripharel vision I had very little time to react as the AI would hone in on my position as a result of the increased difficulty, it made me watch enemies routes and plan on how to avoid them, which made me more invested in my surroundings.  The powers have been worked on to bring in a more skill tree based format. Corvo keeps his powers from the first game although they have matured, giving him a choice of advancing his old powers for stealth or for full combat. Emily's powers seem more based on stealth, her Far Reach is the equivalent of blink but MUCH more useful and she has Domino, which lets her link enemies who will then share fates. This is one of the greatest abilities in the game and I found myself constantly using it in my playthrough to both save ammo and make combat less dangerous. Emily's Doppleganger and mesmerize are a must have for any stealth player as a way to distract enemies from youself.  The environment is also one of your biggest weapons. Glass bottles can know be thrown at enemie's heads for an instant knockout now, proving very useful for players low on sleep darts or saving them. Windows can also be used for the same thing but be careful, an enemy thrown into a window can either die or be knocked out, theres now way to ensure how they end up so be careful. You can also knockout people from the air or mid combat, which is something massively missing from the first game.  Overall:   Dishonored is a great singleplayer game, offering at the least 4 full different playthroughs for players to enjoy which proves very much worth its vaule. The story although starting slow and weak picks up towards the middle and really pulls out some good points to invest you in the world. World design is a massive step up from the original, with even more ways to go about a mission, more beautiful areas that give you an atmosphere of despair and hoplessness from the citizens. Players who love stealth can take the challenege of attempting the game without being scene which really feels like how the games meant to be played, its a great challenege. I cannot even put into words how great my expeirence of this game has been but you can understand your self if you purchase it, you will not regret it!  Tl:dr; Dishonored 2 is really good and you can play it a lot. It improved from the first but the start of the story is pretty slow.",

I was a huge fan of the first, and I love stealth games, so I was excited for this game. I was hoping that they wouldn't mess this one up, and thankfully they didn't. The game isn't perfect, but I definately recommend it.  The game's story is gripping and deep. It plays off of the first game and its DLC, so fans of the game will know what's going on. The start of the story is very abrupt, (even more so than the first game) but it tells you everything you need to know. This is the bad guy, she's really bad, find a way to take her down. There is a twist (sort of) that had me staring at the decision screen for a good ten minutes because I was genuinly torn on what to do. The ending is...meh.  Now the gameplay is really hit or miss. Unlike other stealth games, you can easily recover once you've been spotted, or not even sneak around at all. Sneaking around can be tedious and boring if you don't like stealth, and the combat is so simple that you shouldn't have any difficulties parrying and inta killing most enemies. The only real consequence for beeing spotted is....well being spotted. If you are going for a ghost run you will absolutely have to plan your way through a level...at first. Near the end of the game I felt like a god. You can get crazy overpowered if you collect all the bonecharms and runes. At about level 6 I had to stop myself from collecting any more because the game was getting too easy. It actually wasn't until the last level that I figured out the upgrade system had more than one page, and after that it was all over. The beaty of the game is that you can play it however you want. I simply stopped stopping time and seeing through walls, but if you use those all the way through the game will be a cakewalk. The only complaint that I personally have with the stealth system is how it tracks your detections. I like that it shows you at the end of the level how many times you were detected, but there was one time where I set off no alarms, didn't get into combat, and no enemy gaurds were alerted to my presence whatsoever, but somehow I was spotted thirteen times. I trust that I was spotted, I just wished I knew when. Unless I missed thirteen gaurds chasing after me, it's possible that you can be spotted without alerting anyone, and that's annoying.  All in all it was a good game, probably my favorite at this time. I'm excited to play through as Emily who has a whole new set of powers!  Oh yeah, performance issues. I almost forgot to put this in because they didn't bother me. Yeah I have to play on low until it gets optimized, but that doesn't really bother me. Oh well, I can live without seeing my reflection in the water.",

It has the same excellent level design and world building as its predecessor, with improved AI and expanded abilities. Stealth and combat are equally compelling, though the silly morality system remains intact and still punishes you for killing people. There were some performance issues at launch but they've mostly been resolved as of this review. The only part of the game I found disappointing was the story and supporting cast. The story feels predictable and routine whereas the first game had a pretty major twist that turned everything on its head. The first game also had a large and diverse cast of supporting characters with whom you had meaningful interactions and were a large part of why the twist was so effective. By comparison, Dishonored 2's supporting cast is tiny and your interactions with them are pretty superficial.  If you haven't played Dishonored yet, you really should before buying Dishonored 2. The series is best described as Thief + Bioshock. If that sounds appealing to you, you'll be in for a treat. If not, the first game regularly goes on sale for $5 so it isn't exactly a big risk to try out. If you enjoy it, make sure to pick up the excellent DLC as well.

I got so excited when it was announced, and I got even more excited when it was delivered, the only thing that dampened my mood was all the bad reviews about performance, I just decided to give it a try, not that I could have waited if I wanted to, my hands were already twitching.  I dove in headfirst, pushing all my settings up to Ultra, lo and behold, the game worked perfectly fine, it was running smoothly at 60 fps and it looks stunning, my specs: Intel Core i5-3570K CPU @ 3.40GHz , NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970, 8 GB RAM running on Windows 8.1. and these aren't the best!  I have not had any crashes or odd bugs!  Now to the game itself:  I chose to play Emily on my first playthrough and I am having loads of fun, the combat is amazing, especially the kill animations, it feels smooth and brutal at the same time. I am one who prefers to go all out assassin in games like this, clearing entire areas and then finding every single hidden secret there is, and it has surprised me that even though I have been so thorough I actually missed a few things, making me want to do it again in a second playthrough. Oh, and Emily's powers are extremely fun, especially the Shadow Walk, love it!  The story like in the first game is very captivating, especially if you read through all the notes, the characters are interesting and the music perfectly sets the mood, I can't wait to dive deeper into this fascinating world.  To me it is a great game, and I still have aways to go, I will update once I have played through completely.  Enjoy!",

            "review_text": "Right now Dishonored 1 is honestly a better looking game then Dishonored 2. Because of technical issues and the art direction unfortunately.  There is something seriously wrong with the post effects and antialiasing to the point where it has made me want to go play the first game instead - as the pixel crawling and terrible smudging/sampling artefacts spoil the experience so much. Either they have a graphics bug somewhere or this is the worst implementation of a modern deferred renderer in an AAA product to date (And they need to fly in the id-tech6 team to fix this pronto). It doesn't matter what settings are used.  Performance is still not very good or consistent at all. Although so far I haven't experienced what I have read from the worst reports. It is playable but not fluid. This is on the following spec with the settings (I tried them all) not really making any difference:  Dishonored 2, 1.3 patch 1920x1080 at various settings nVidia driver 376.19 GTX1080 8GB VRAM i7 3770K 32GB RAM Win7 64bit  If they don't really fix this then you are probably better waiting a few years until GPU's can brute force supersample this into something with decent image quality at a decent frame rate.  I understand what they were trying to do with the art direction by retaining elements of the originals impressionistic style but meshing it with more sophisticated realtime lighting - such as the faux subsurface scattering on characters and something that crosses between an oil painted look and more physically based reflections on metallic surfaces for example.  To be fair I don't think the artists did a bad job at all, and the art is very good, but overall it just doesn't quite reach the same visual heights and consistency of the first game. Trying to define and progress a new realtime impressionistic art style is a lofty goal, that they should be applauded for attempting.  The lighting doesn't look as good as in the first game. The quality of baked lighting is still hard to beat of course and especially so for a game like this.  Strangely the id-tech5 engine that was used in RAGE (One of the most beautiful games ever made still) has seemingly been butchered. The performance problems that engine used to have are long gone since the various graphics vendors fixed the unoptimised texture streaming paths in their graphics drivers a long time ago. As it was also a forward renderer it has fantastic MSAA quality so they probably would have had a much better result if they hadn't rewrote the rendering engine and designed the game around the id-tech5 engine instead (Although sure that may have caused issues for the clockwork mansion level).  Also as their game levels are smaller and due to tech advances over the years they could have had much higher texture resolution up close then RAGE had - fixing a common complaint. The impressionistic style done with unique texturing everywhere would have really been special for Dishonored2. But they ripped out megatextures and they actually downgraded the engine from OpenGL to DirectX11 bizarrely (OpenGL 4.3/4.5 is better then DirectX11). They probably would have had a better result sticking with UE3 rather than doing what they did.  There are lots of tell tale signs of sloppy or rushed deadline programming overall with things like the mouse pointer speed and response in the UI menus being awful. But I am sure they can at least fix these minor things.  As fantastic as Robin Lord Taylor can be on TV I found him much worse then the Outsiders' original voice actor - it felt like his first video game voice acting gig. The rest of the voice acting goes from great, to good, to bad, to perhaps badly directed. The opening of the story in the throne room could have been handled better but it at least got the game going quickly in a way that paralleled the first game. Really it is the combination of just enough world building and story to surround the fantastic gameplay in Dishonored that makes it work so well. So I have no real complaints there.  Gameplay wise the game is great however. Which makes it all the more disappointing that the visuals let the game down so much and ruin the experience. As shallow as that may sound it unfortunately is something that is at the very core of how Dishonored brings you into its' world.  Encountering the gigantic whale hung for slaughter in the first game left a lasting impression of awe with how amazing it all looked. When I came across the barnacle encrusted whales in Dishonored2 I thought wow they don't look quite as good but I 'could see where they were trying to go with it'.  I sincerely hope Arkane can improve the situation as they are obviously a very talented group that throughout their development history have taken some very brave design risks. This isn't a bad game at all, and is an improvement over the first in many areas. However the first Dishonored game was so consistently good in comparison it's going to be a tough one to beat even after many patches.",

            "review_text": "When I heard Arkane were finally making a sequel to my beloved Dishonored I peed my pants a bit then I cried a bit because sequels to your most beloved games are often ♥♥♥♥♥, take Dragon Age II for example, a game I came to love but made me sick to my stomach after Origins. I was terrified that they would change it too much, try to be trendy and keep up with the kids, maybe include Minecraft inspired settlement building or an Angry Birds level or some other equally horrible commerical balls. However, I am ecstatic to say that Dishonored is still Dishonored, it still has the same lonely, gritty atmosphere, the same beautifully realised world, hidden secrets, tragic and incredibly drawn NPCs and is as rich in lore and intrigue as the original. The stealth and combat use the exact same mechanics too which means I was able to pick up my controller and hammer away at the buttons and die just as easily as I did the first time around. I will say that I am finding it much more challenging this time, but that is probably only because I played the original to death and need more practice.  I've chosen Emily for my first playthrough because it seems natural for the story to follow her events. She has some incredible new powers which I am still getting to grips with, particularly Doppelganger which projects a copy of her that the guards are supposed to chase leaving you to get away clean. My Doppelganger, however, runs towards me drawing the hostiles This is me being hopeless and drunk rather than the game I think...  The voices are wonderful, I was particularly worried about Corvo being voiced since he is supposed to be the classic silent protagonist but Stephen Russell (Garrett, Nick Valentine and Mercer Fray among othersl) is suble and somehow lovable in his role, as is Erica Lutrell as Emily. She manages to sound both like Chloe Moretz (young Emily) and like her mother, Jessamine Kaldwin voiced by April Stewart in the original.  Overall it is harder and creepier than before. Playing with headphones makes the guards' footsteps almost unbearably scary and there is this screaming, insane woman.. The tension has been ramped up along with enemies' lethality - be warned it seems to be much harder to escape when you thought you were just gonna smack that guard over the head with a whisky bottle...  A quick word about performance - yes I've been having issues with horrible lag too and no I don't play on a potato, or a toaster or microwave. My rig is top notch, although my best GPU died recently, my second best is still above and beyond recommended settings. Having said that its not, like, unplayable - it lags and stutters sometimes and combat is bloody difficult because of it, but I am still over the moon because it is Dishonored and they will make a patch and it fills my sad and lonely life with joy so peace out my gameplaying friends.  Dislikes: I'm not keen on the Outsider's new voice he sounds like he is on a combination of Helium and Caffeine, he needs to sound more mysterious and menacing, we're not having a chat in Starbucks, we're supposed to be in the goddam Void for chrissakes. I can't remember the others because I am drunk. Oh yeah, I die a lot but that's probably because I am drunk.   TL;DR Just buy the damn game already, unless your computer really is a potato.",

I don't often finish a game and immediately want to start it again, but I am determined to do a high chaos Corvo playthrough having enjoyed doing it stealthily as Emily.

It is easy for me to recommend such a game, and I do so wholeheartedly. Note, that I've only done a single playthrough as Corvo and intend to update this review, if necessary, after doing so with Emily.  In the end, though, even I have to admit that Dishonored 2 does suffer from a few issues compared to the first game. The voice acting has suffered in some areas, and something about the game engine causes voice lines to trigger a bit too fast, making many conversations seem hasty and twisted as the characters seemingly try to cut one another off mid-sentence. The story, as well, seems to pick up a bit too hastily compared to the first game, and the whats and the why's, the motivations that drive many of the characters, are a bit too obscure.  All in all, while not perfect and not quite up to par with the first game, Dishonored 2 is a great game to put a few evenings into and it serves well both for those garnering for stealth-oriented gameplay or bloodthirsty and imaginative murder-fests.   Playtime: 16+ hours (single playthrough as Corvo)  Ratings (1-10) Visual: 10 Audio: 9 Story: 8 Gameplay: 9 Overall: 9",

Cons -  - The optimization is pretty poor.   - Some glitches in some of the levels makes the game unplayable or you have to restart the whole game/mission.  - Clockwork Soldiers are a pain to kill    Overall:  I'd say this game was pretty good, better than the original, but the optimization is pretty poor as I get a smooth frame rate one minute and then the next it slows to 25fps.

If you prefer frenetic FPS games, this is not your one, get the awesome Doom (latest). If you've already played Dishonored 1 and you liked it then, you will be not disapointed, this is what you were waiting for. If you never played Dishonored but you like stealth games, as Splinter Cell or Thief or alike, you will be at home. Graphics are gorgeous and maps are large enough. Characters look so ugly and odd as in the first game, instead. The game can be played in any way you want: do you like to kill as a mad? you got it. Do you want to pass as a shadow? you got it. Do you want a mix of everything? you got it. Most of times, there is not a single path to do things so, re-playability is ensured. The more you play, the more you realize that you could did it other way. Total freedom to walk (or jump) across the scenarios, at floor level or high level. Recolection of runes and bones is just a way to visit the whole maps, which adds a lot of extra playing hours. Special mention to a couple of chapters, which are total mind-benders, very specially the one related to the Mechanic House (awesome !!!), but also the one with the parallel-time device (what an original and interesting idea !!!). I've only had some issues with the latest chapter (9) where the game crashed everytime that I had to fight against witches and spectral dogs so, I used the rats mood to avoid such crashes (but you can go the stealth way, anyway). At the beginning, I was surprised that Arkane/Bethesda used the ID-based Void engine, instead of the highly performant and reliable Unreal one but, everything made sense on the two awesome chapters mentioned above. ID engines are often giving issues to people and, I bet this is why this awesome game gets so bad reviews (and I can fully understand it, since I had same feeling with lot of ID-based games). Maybe, I was looking this time and, downloaded and played it after the second or third patch, which made my playing experience enjoyable. Please, if you are getting technical issues, be patient, wait until they are fixed but, don't miss this game, it's really a very good one and, your mind will blow up with those two mentioned chapters. Those two set this game appart the first one and any other game you've played.",

Other than the performance thing, the game played very well on day one with few bugs and is in almost all ways an upgrade to Dishonored 1.  I reccomend the game, but if you were a hardcore player of Dishonored 1, there's something missing from its sequel that I can't place but was very vital. You'll love the game, but somewhere deep down I expected something more than I got, and I'm not exactly sure what.  Also, I wouldn't spend $60 on this if you're only gonna play through it once. You have two characters to choose from, unique dialogue for both of them plus many things change based on the way you play. At the time of writing, I have 66 hours on record and it's been 12 days since release. Buy it when it goes on sale if you won't replay it. If you're like me and will replay it as many times as feels good, then $60 is a fair price.

This game feels kinda rushed, like they refined the first game and threw a number two on the end. The gameplay is amazing, it's been refined to a truly AAA level but the biggest complaint I have by far is the voice acting and character development. I honestly don't like Corvo's voice, his voice should be a little more rugged, Emily's however is amazing, everyone else's is alright but The Outsider... The Outsider has changed drastically, he no longer floats and talks to you, he teleports around you talking to you and has a new mischievous voice to match and it just doesn't appeal to me. All in all it's a great game, even if I don't agree with some changes I'm still going to play the hell out of it.  EDIT: After some more hours into the game my complaints are few, it still doesn't quite live up to the first game as far as story goes, and I've noticed a lot of lore is just thrown in your face. For example   I found out Emily is Corvo's daughter and the heart is the late empress's cut out of her corpse by piaro in the first game through lots of research disscussions and gameplay  , but in this game it that information is just thrown in your face. My conclusion stands, I still love it.

Including a movement spell (Far Reach) to either pull yourself towards a foe or a foe towards yourself. (Shadow Walk) is surprisingly effective for taking out single enemies, but the mana consumption per transformationmay seem to much for 'just a target'. Me on the other hand, i used this to avoid enemy detection in close proximity, as it makes you look like a shadow and thus hiding your presence. Unless you literally stand and touch an enemy. The last power, that I unlocked (and that Corvo doesn't have) is called 'Domino', which grants you the ability to link targets with each other (up to 4). The linked targets will share the same fate. Like if you knock one linked target out, so will be the remaining ones. This also applies to a more lethal approach. Highly recommended for situations with a high amount of enemy presence.   The game in general has improved a lot over the 4 years between the prequel and the release of the sequel. The PC Masterrace had some major issues with framerate drops for low-ende/budget and high-end machines alike. The precision weapon of choice, the mouse, also had input lags, which made the gameplay a lot more choppy. After around 2 weeks, Arkane Studios released a hotfix for the mentioned problems and it seems a lot more playable, even though I finished my first run before the patch.  Gameplay 9/10 (includes the almost infinite ways of overcoming an obstacle, many many upgrades. Apparently not a traditional Open-world game)  Sound 9/10 (eerie winds, whispers, waves crashing against the ship,...)

I loved the original and was more than happy to purchase the sequal but I kept my hopes low in case the game didn't live up to it's name.  Luckily it did. Although there were some initial performance issues many have been drastically reduced or removed, granting me a 20+ fps boost if not more. It's still not perfect but performance is not a reason to give up on this title.  As far as gameplay, I've beaten the game once as Corvo playing full stealth, nonlethally, without powers, on the hardest difficulty. This run took me 32 hours and it revealed exactly how much thought went into the levels. The world is filled with back alleys, rooftops, hidden paths, and any number of other interesting scenarios to explore as well as some excellently-written lore pieces and notes. I don't normally like reading newspapers scattered in a game but Dishonored 2 made it worth it. Every mission was interesting and even my least favorite was still an amazing presentation of a level.  My one gripe is this, well, two things. As a small point there are a few lines of dialogue that seem unnatural or poorly read, but this is common in most games so I won't make a big deal of it. More importantly, because the game allows you to play without powers, there is almost always a way to reach an objective without them. This isn't a bad thing in and of itself but in playing again with powers some of the challenges now seem far too easy or not even like challenges at all. What previously took an hour now takes a minute with a few blinks or far-reaches. This might just be a result of my choosing to play without powers first but powers do certainly cheapen many of the games more challenging areas.  All in all I loved Dishonored 2, it might be my favorite game of the year. Consider it if you're a fan of the franchise or someone looking for a study in excellent level and mission design. Even though it's not perfect, Dishonored 2 is a game I'll be pouring much more time into and I'll be enjoying every minute.",

Her new set of powers are refreshing enough to be interesting but still provide you with enough of the same to make your strategies from the first game valid. They've also definitely made it easier to differentiate between playing low or high chaos, which I quite enjoy since it feels more like a 'choice' rather than accidentally messing up an encounter and being screwed. Furthermore it feels like you have quite a bit more freedom in how to tackle every single mission, since there are many paths that lead towards the same goal, and it really challenged me to go explore.   All in all, what I loved about the original I love about Dishonored 2; the settings still feel almost magical and strange and make me want to explore, the characters all have their virtues and vices, the story is engaging and the stealth is actually fun instead of an impossibly frustrating task.",

Can’t take it anymore. Low frame rates. Stuttering. Blurry textures (as a result of dropping video settings). The game’s video preset function assesses my system and sets almost all properties to “Very Low,” while disabling nearly all post-processing operations. This, on system that runs DOOM silky smooth at “High” settings and all post-processing features enabled.  Yes, the bad news you’ve been hearing about the game’s laggy-ness on PCs is true. Makes me sad because I played Dishonored 1 at least five times through. Love the universe. Love the story. Love the action. Did I mention the problem with the video performance with Dishonored 2? Anyways, yeah. Makes me sad. So, not recommending until they fix it.  My system: AMD FX 8350 (4.0 GHz) 16 G RAM nVidia GeForce GTX 950 with 2 G video RAM  Meanwhile, I’ll make a few brief comments on the game’s story. I’ll just say that the “feel” of the experience is a bit different. Good, and very interesting… The story for Dishonored 2 significantly brings in elements from the first game’s DLC. And things fit together very nicely. Definitely worth playing… if they ever fix the video performance issues. Just wait until they do. ",

            "review_text": "I have had a blast in this game on my first play-through! I played as Emily and as non-lethal as I could all the way up until the very end. I domino killed 99% of Delilah's witches and then in the final part, I decided to return to the non-lethal approach. It was simply a matter of knowing how much ammunition I had available and acting in the best way to manage it all until the end part.    I really like how my decisions actually effect the game. For example, I chose to put someone to sleep in a mission and when I completed the mission, I came out and Meagan Foster's right arm was restored and that was a very pleasant surprise! That is just one example of how effectual my decisions were in the game. I am not going to give spoilers, so you'll just have to play it and see for yourself - which I certainly do recommend.    Since the launch of this game, I have had no issues at all. I had overclocked my EVGA GTX 1070 FTW too far and that caused the game to not work correctly - that was my own fault. My gameplay since launch, stayed at 60 fps with only the occasional dip to about 55 fps. That is absolutely stellar in my personal opinion.    Arkane Studios did an amazing job on this game. Now that I have played as Emily as non-lethal as I am able, I will start a new game and again play as Emily but lethal this time. Afterwards, I will play twice more as Corvo: once as non-lethal as I am able and finally as lethal.   Yes, I enjoyed this game that much. I am very impressed with this franchise and I am hopeful for a third edition in the coming years and in the meantime, I will continue to enjoy both Dishonored and Dishonored 2. I love games that I can play multiple times in multiple ways. I have also played Dishonored (1) as lethal and then as non-lethal and it definitely effected that game's gameplay as well. So, I recommend that everyone also experience Dishonored (1) as well.    Thank you Bethesda and Arkane for another great and very fun game!",

The good :  Fantastic level design, the levels are huge and so well designed that even after 3 playthrough I still find new ways to aboard a mission. Setting is amazing, Karnaca is believable and looks gorgeous Gameplay is the same as the first Dishonored, but perfected : you can do non lethal combat now, slide eliminations and knockout drops.  The guards are way better at their job, you will get detected if you're in their peripheral vision ( You can no longer lean right or left to peek out of a corner and stay invisible! ) and they can actually look up or down. The music fits perfectly. Great voice acting in general, despite a few cheesy lines. Great UI design.  The bad :  The main hub, especially compared to the Pub from the first game, is very empty. Rushed intro and ending. Bad performance ( Mostly fixed by the patches for me, though. )",

This game is great in my opinion, sure it has a few problems none of which are gamplay or graphic-wise (my biggest problem is with the change in the Outsider's voice but I can look past that and view the masterpiece in wake of that one flaw). The visuals are stunning to look at, the gameplay is hours of fun and the story is decent. The problem is in the game's optimizing apparently, and that's not something to look passed and say 'If it worked this would be a great game!' then give it a positive review based on what you hoped the gae would be. I personally have had no performance issues, so I guess I'm one of the lucky ones. So based on my experience of the game, the game is great! I'd recommend it for sure if there was a way of knowing for sure the game worked with your computer. Corvo's back! That's great (I haven't played as him yet), and his voice is perfect for him. The character didn't have a voice in the first game, and giving a beloved character who didn't speak in the first game a voice is always going to be risky, but I think by giving the role to the voice of Garrett from the 'Thief' series is a bonus, especially when you consider the thief games and their influence on the development of Dishonored. Our dear Emily has all grown up and you can play as her. Her abilities are interesting and differ greatly to Corvo's while still at times feeling reminicent as to make sure you're not unable to reach places as one character that you couldn't reach as the other. There's so much negativity in these reviews, and what I personally believe to be unnecessary negativity. I haven't had a single problem with the game not working, crashing or having low frame-rates and I know I'm one of the lucky ones who hasn't had issues. I feel like I need to dilute this negativity with my own positivity to some extent. So this is a place-holder for now in hopes that one day I'll actually be able to do this game justice but there needs to be more positive out there so I'm doing my part. If you're interested in purchasing the game... I'd have to say wait, but that doesn't mean I'm saying not to purchase. Definitely come back to this once it's been polished up a bit so you can live this experience the same way I've been fortunate enough to be able to.",

In low chaos you'll be able to watch two lovers sing while dancing on a top, in high, they killed each other. Perhaps you want to watch some idiot robbers try and trick you into helping them but when they fail to draw anyone, they laugh about it and go about their business but in another run, one of them kills the other for being a horrible actress.   Corvo and Emily also change due to your gameplay, becoming colder and deadlier or warmer and realizing the mistakes they made in the past.   The new powers are fun, the old powers are fun and there's more customization with the bone charms this time as you can make your own.  Finally a tip: Hit F to stop moving when using Emily's far reach. That power is fun but has lead to a many of my deaths.",

The game still doesn't reach 60 fps on my 960m, but it does play at stable 30fps in 900p on Medium preset, which is alright in terms of performance, especially since the game looks gorgeous even at these settings. However, if you have a high tier rig, you might still be very disappointed with your frames per second, even on lower settings and resolution. The combat is roughly as good as it was in the first game (which is quite a high standard to keep up), however there are more non-lethal options, which makes low chaos playthroughs a lot more dynamic than they were. The game is still very easy in terms of combat, maybe even easier, if you compare very hard to very hard (particularly due to new reflexes enhancement and slide-attack finisher), but in terms of stealth it is a lot more challenging, while at the same time providing more options, so overall ghost+clean hands playthrough is far less of a quickload simulator, which is a very positive change. The storyline feels rushed for a pretty simple reason: there are fewer targets for you to eliminate, and even those you do don't really feel as necessary as they are presented to you by the game. DH1 felt longer and less straightforward due to the betrayal twist, while DH2 has a more unified plot. Also, while maps have became significantly bigger, that is only due to their width and height, not their length, so a lot of the time you feel like you are prolonging the mission artificially. The characters are OK, I'd say they are better than what we had in DH1, but there are fewer of them, so that does't feel like a major side of the game. Voiceacting and most of the writing are absolutely amazing, however. Particularly the heart is very good, and as the game has a few 'peaceful' areas, you can get that RPG-esque feel of being in a living city, and not just in a big violent puzzle. The soundtrack is nice. In fact, I am listening to it right now, and I am even considering to load it to my player (if only there was a lossless version!), that's how good it really is. Too bad you don't hear much of it in the actual game. So even if you don't buy the game, at least listen to this masterpiece. What this game really exceeds at, are level design and atmosphere. And when I say level design, I mean both the visuals and gameplay part. Every building has some tactical options in it, and some theme that is either limiting or helping you. All the apartments and shops feel like actual appartments and shops. You rarely feel like some particular item is there just for the player, and not because it has it's reason to be there. Karnaca looks absolutely astonishing, and that's a rare case for a low-spec gamer like me. So, to sum this up, this game is certainly playable, despite all the performance issues and clearly the best game of 2016 to me and, probably, to anyone who treats games like art, not just blank entertainment.",

The plot is setup well, and the choice of Emily or Corvo fits well with either choice. (Although the game seems to want you to pick Emily.) Parts of this game take place in Dunwall, and I was hoping to see some of the places I had seen in the first game. This didn't happen. However overall, it's a well-driven story.  PERFORMANCE: I run the game around 30 fps, with the occasional spike to 60 fps in areas that aren't very graphically demanding. The adaptive resolution method works, but makes the game look terrible. Specs: Fx-6300 16gb ddr3 gtx 750ti  Pros: •Well established plot •New and old abilities •Lots of history and culture •Choice of character (Male-Corvo/Female-Emily) •Many different methods to complete missions •Tutorials in the menu to learn mechanics •Autosaves  Cons: •There is no real indication as to whether or not you're completely undetected •The sensitivity is low no matter how high you set it •The VOID engine makes the game very hard to run •The solution to very low graphics make the game look VERY bad •Steam overlay doesn't seem to work in the VOID engine •Little to no places to hide bodies  Overall I still recommend Dishonored 2 because the game itself is very well put together, and the graphical issues introduced on PC have an 'Adaptive Resolution' option that makes the game playable (Even though it looks horrible).",

From a quarter that is focused on mining, to a harbor, to an institute, to a huge, yet very closed off modernized castle. i dont feel as though i am wandering through the same streets everywhere i go. Not one single area feels alike to the next. for design as well, Dishonored stays true to the drab and exquisite dead feeling that the first one had with the plague, in this world, the plague takes form of mosquito like creatures called bloodflies and are almost alike to the rats except they infest a room and that room alone making it a possibilty to find increasingly better loot within those houses. overall Dishonored 2 has stuck true to the first, and i can safely say i am pleased with how they made the sequel.",

In fact on my laptop Im playin in 1080 p High textures no Rat/Blood Bug shadows Its like butter.... smoooooth.   Original Review (early release)... My Bad: Game is still in Beta. Like every other god damn PC release. I am an idiot for spending money and building a Great PC. It is clear that the only companies that give a ♥♥♥♥ about quality are CDprojekt red, and Rockstar. Did you know that statistics show that the P.C. Market is almost the same size as the entire console market ? Google it. There is real money to be made  in the P.C. space (WOW). We expect a min of 60fps stable across all native resolutions. We expect our games to utilize the expensive hardware we have all bought and payed for (relative to console prices). Take the time you require to release a P.C. worthy game ! By the way, (semi related to this release) Bethesda is leading an anti consumer movement and I for one will not purchase any more of their titles. Even though I once loved them lol.

Even with these settings, I still struggle to breach the 40fps line. Even at these settings the game looks incredible. It's a testament to the art team for making something look so incredible that on low settings like this you can't help but marvel.   However, I still ♥♥♥♥ing love this game, perhaps more than the original, and that is why I'm giving it a thumbs up.  Because, once you look past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimisation, you realise the dev team went above and beyond and improved on the original in every way. The locations are larger, much more vertical, and much much much more detailed. The unique locations you visit are all visually distinct, with one late game mission in particular sticking out for me because of a (spoiler) time travel element.   I played the first playthrough as Corvo (took me 9 hours, with the final 2 missions sort of rushed because it was 6am and I really wanted to see the end, so I would say around 11 hours for a high chaos playthrough, which is what I did), and was very happy to see I could make the exact same build as in the old game. The abilities, for those who played the first game's dlc, are Corvo's but with some of Daud's tweaks in the mix. Like, blink can be upgraded to stop time when you aren't moving but you are holding down the power button. It's all very familiar in that department, but in a great way. Haven't played Emily yet, but I very much plan on doing so.  Running on an 880m for anyone who is wondering. Think a slightly underclocked 760.

One of the biggest things I love about this game and the first one is that it is a play your way type thing. If you want to sneak through the levels unseen, you can try that. If you want to run around killing everyone/ thing you see HEY you can do that too.   For me the story was not as gripping in this games as it was in the first. It was, nonetheless, interesting all the same. I do like that they lengthened the amount of time that the story takes to play out. If you're not sure if you'll enjoy this game or not I would tell you to buy the first one, it is only 10 bones after all. If you like the first one do not hesitate to pick this one up too. It is pretty much everything you love about the first one with a better engine and sharper graphics.

Theres no point in sneaking around when you can just easily sword fight everyone to death as well as 1 shot kill everyone with your gun.

Even more so than Dishonored 1 which is a phenominal game. Very well could be my game of the year. Playing as Corvo first play through, he is like an old friend. Story is fantastic so far and the mechnanics are fluid.   As for those having issues with fps, try keeping view distance down as well as disable god rays and lens flare. Otherwise on a mid range system you should be able to run comfortably above 30 fps constantly and with fairly high graphical settings. Hope this helps. And if you are trying for above 60 fps constantly (i fluctuate anywhere from 45-100), then just wait a bit for the patches.",

I remember the interviews with the devs a few months back. The biggest complaint of the first game was its length, for me it took me about 9hrs my first time as i just did the main story, going as chaotic as possible and not really doing any of the collectibles or side 'encounters'. IN these interviews the devs specifically said the game would be longer than the first, anywhere from 12-20 hours, with that i thought it would be safe to say that with doing all the side activities it could be anywhere from 25-30 hrs. BUT no.....ive done may of the side activities and it still only took about 9hrs to complete the game. so if anything its shorter, just with more replayability then the first  IF you know you love dishonored id say buy this, otherwise what for a sale as its hard to justify the $60 price with the minimal content included.",

Each level is full of details and I enjoy playing full stealth, finding secrets, runes and alternative ways. Story isn't something groundbreaking and never seen, but it's decent. Back story and lore is much more interesting so be sure to read all documents and listen to all conversations and audio logs.

I am one of those players that reads everything they can find, and I have to say the lore and little side stories that you find throughout the game are fantastic and very well written.  The new special abilities that they added are fantastic! They are creative and give the player new options to complete objectives (ex: chaining enemies together, then killing one kills the others). Dishonored has always been great at allowing the player to choose how to approach obstacles, and the sequel continues that theme.

The AI is a bit stupid, but most AI in games are. The new powers for Emily are a bit underwelming, and they dont feel that useful to invest into. You can honeslty invest all the way into far reach and domino and you can beat the game easily. Now onto the performance... YES the fps is an issue, but it is not game breaking for me atleast. I get pretty good frames in most areas (50-90). I turned off AA also on my game and to me it looks better but thats just my opinion.

Having so much fun even though i kill myself million times for not being a good assassin. The game has lots similarity and difference compare to previous one. The story is awesome and it connects to dishonored 1, so if you haven't play it, i highly recommend you to do it! The only problem is that fps drops a lot indoor area. I played this game with my laptop so there is no surprise, but i think the minimum spec is too high compare to in-game graphics. It was definitely improved from the previous game, but it doesn't look like latest games. Anyway, in general, i loved the game and i am going to play three more times just to see the different endings. If you enjoyed last one, play the new one!!! No regrets!

So far, absolutely none of the performance issues people are talking about, even though I seem to have similar specs to people supposedly suffering performance issues, in some cases less (GTX1070, i7-4970k non-overclocked, 16Gb DDR3 running off of a 250GB SSD) With V-Sync I get a straight 60, anywhere &amp; everwhere, without V-Sync it hovers around 100 - 110.   HBAO+ does cause a performance (~100fps to ~80fps, not to be sneezed at) with no appreciable effect on graphics, so just leave it off.  There's lot of good graphics options here for us PC users, including FOV sliders.   For the game itself (and my ~1hr play time), it feels distinctly like Dishonored. I felt the plot starts a bit abruptly before really getting a chance to introduce the more mature characters, but even in the first 15 minutes you're giving a target to kill (or dispose of non-violently), have a beautiful mansion to explore and some audio tapes to listen to, to help set the mood (not to mention getting to choose between Corvo or Emily)  Definitely looking to get into.  TL;DR: Performance issues are hit and miss, some get it others (myself included) don't see them at all. Shaping up to be an excellent sequel.",

There are two ways to play the game: As Corvo, the master assassin you took control of in the first game, or his daughter and now Empress of Dunwall Emily. During my first playthrough I am playing as Emily and have to say that the powers she has are a lot of fun. Shadow walk for example lets you crawl around a level more stealthily, and Domino lets you link two enemies in order to have their fatal fate shared. Of course the powers that were available in the first Dishonored do have a comeback here and there are all sorts of Bonecharms that give you extra perks, which can be very helpful to support your playstyle.  The other main character, like in the fist installment of this franchise, is the game world itself. The developers at Arcane Studios have put in a lot of effort to create a living and breathing world with interesting characters and locations that are filled with a ton of lovely details for you to find and fill your pockets with. On top of that the lore you find in books, letters and the environmental storytelling are once more fascinating to me, so I really enjoy to delve into the world of Dishonored 2 every time. I recommend this game to anyone who liked the first Dishonored and those people who appreciate modern stealth games that draw an interesting world around its mechanics. ",

One of the best mechanics in this is how the world changes depending on how many people you kill or not kill, being able to just kill everyone is easy, but later in the game you will be overwhelmed by bloodflies. If you take the time to play stealth its alot harder but more rewarding in the outcome of the game.

I don't think that deserves a poor rating-- the story is great, the characters are amazing, the world is immersive and well-developed...  With that said, it isn't a necessity for me for a game to have a high framerate. People here are complaining of drops to 30 fps and that does not bother me. If it bothers you, wait for a patch. Some people want consistently better than 60 fps on their high-end PCs, and I mean, fine, but IMO that doesn't mean you should give the game a bad review. Wait for the patch, THEN review. (Unless you plan on editing your review after they fix the graphics problems? Most people don't bother to do that, tho.)

So pretty much if I get caught, theres a higher chance of me dying that survivng. It was so hard for me to even block Corvo in training bc of the FPS. No matter what I do i cant really play.

My rig is nothing special (reitterating this),gtx 960, i5 6600, 8gb RAM, plays perfectly fine so I do very much so reccomend this game, looks to be hit or miss with your download but still im bedazzled on how im runnimng this well when kids with 1060's/1070's can hardly get 60 fps on high. there is a patch that will most likely come out by monday and hopefully it comes with more optimization so I can see if I can FOR SURE run this on high but im almost completed emily's playthrough and it never dropped below 50 at the very least. for sure playable and absolutely has some replayability with each area having multipler objectives and little side missions you can take on. Combat feels phenominal although I have seen a couple funny bugs like characters walking into a wall constantly and not figuring out that theres a solid object blocking them. Nothing game breaking tho. As of right now its a 8.5-9/10 for me and I am very excited to see what DLC they put out for this game as DH1 had some great DLC as well. If this game was somehow co op it would be a 10/10 in my books but it doesnt NEED co op either. Still confused on how im running this off a 960.",

The game improves upon the original Dishonored in its level design and general elements of its stealth gameplay: guards are more perceptive, light/shadow contrasts are utilised more and height factors based on the level layout also affect where and how you should be sneaking. There's more tools for non-lethal playthroughs now; stun mines, drop-attacks and sting darts. It really feels like Arkane listened to feedback on the first game and delivered a solution. The levels in this game are phenominal, real wide open areas with tons of tiny details packed into them. Even the ones that aren't spectacles visually are still made interesting with lots of events, exploration opportunities and secrets to find. I'm really glad they kept this approach to level design over going open world like every other game feels they have to do now.  Along with solutions comes compromise; Dishonored 2 is a great game, and builds upon it's interesting lore with lots of audiographs, newspapers, letters and books to really make you invested in its world. Beyond all this, the writing falls short. The plot is a generic revenge plot outshadowed by Corvo's escapade 15 years earlier in the original game. Characters are dull - Erica Luttrell and Stephen Russell are fantastic voice actors that were wasted on monotone dialogue and commentary. The plot just doesn't have as much bite this time, you as a player don't feel urgency to pursue these assination targets as you did in the first game.  Nevertheless, even with the lesser points weighed in, Dishonored 2 is a great game with many options available for the player just as they were in the first. Worth playing, if not buying.",

I felt I needed to continue the story with Corvo first, and I will play as Emily next, trying for the low chaos gameplay. It felt good to see some familiar faces back, and to meet new ones. And I just loved the settings..Karnaca looks lovely, I enjoyed the view from Kirin Jindosh's balcony...and to hide from the dust storms that came every now and then. It's so nice to explore the world.  I also hope that there will come a DLC (or more then one) for this game as well, as it did with the first game.

There were reports of TXAA being the culprit, and I doubt most people here have turned that off which means their 'reviews' are incomprehensive.  As for the gameplay itself, I was already a huge fan of the first DIshonored. I have not done a playthrough as Corvo yet so I can't compare how he plays in the first one to now, but Emily's playstyle is a refreshing change. It made me realize how much I relied on certain cheap tricks in the first game to get through, and they've all but removed or diminished all of those tricks to the point where I'm constantly having to think on my feet and come up with alternate strategies.  In short, I'm loving it. It plays much like the first one in that it's divided up in to missions, going so far as to even start them out with someone dropping you off at your mission start in a boat. The levels however are massive, easily twice the size of the previous games' levels, and they're absolutely steeped in lore, neat hidden nooks and crannys, and alternate routes. I'm up to mission 4 and so far, it definitely warrants at least a couple more replays. I'm already ready to revisit older levels to try and do better than I did previously.  While non-lethal seems to be much harder to pull off, they're more forgiving if you have to kill a couple of soldiers who spotted you. I've probably had to kill 20-30 soldiers, and I'm still operating in low chaos.  Overall the game runs fine on my system, yes they need to fix any compatibility issues with other systems (seems to be related more to AMD), but it's still an amazing game, and the port is well done in terms of options for customizability.

Take note though that the game invites violence, and that will in turn increase your chaos level. If you play like I did on my first run.. the ending will be darker. So getting a nicer ending actually is harder. I will try that later, because the violence path is oh so rewarding. The outsider sticks it to you several times (without disclosing anything) on your chosen path. The AI is much better in the sequel.. it will look at places where a bottle is likely to have been thrown from etc.. So be prepared to move. This one is much less forgiving when it comes to tricking the AI. The story is engaging and fun to play.. but like most games, is isn't top notch story telling.

A slight graphics glitch on loading a quicksave, but its minor and only lasts a fraction of second, otherwise no noticeable poor framerates or glitches of any kind.

I think there are so many people that give a game a thumbs-down on Steam just because it has some performance issues when it's just been released. Truth is, we're going to have to get used to this. We always want to know a fixed release date when we are waiting for a game, which is perfectly fine, but we shouldn't complain if it doesn't run perfectly smooth or still has some bugs. At least we're the ones forcing the developer to release the game on this exact date - otherwise we get mad too. So, please, community, can we stop writing negative comments complaining about technical problems that are most likely going to be fixed soon? If these patches never come - feel free to complain. If you dislike a game because of other reasons - go ahead, write your review. But all this 'Why can't they release a perfect game?'- stuff is becoming very annoying. Remember the 2016 Hitman? Everybody hated it when it came out, because of performance issues. It's been the same for Just Cause 3 - Both are, undoubtedly, great games now.  So, please give Dishonored 2 some time. Of course it still has these issues too, but only complaining about them will only prevent you from seeing what this game actually is: A fantastic, awesome sequel.  Seriously, Dishonored 2 takes everything that was great in the predecessor and enhances it, as well as adding lots of cool new gameplay elements, such as Emily's powers, which are absolutely amazing. I didn't play the whole game yet, but the story is very promising and the new setting is wonderful. Every Dishonored fan is definitely going to enjoy this game.

As for the game itself i loved it, beautifully done, it felt like the first game where it mattered and improved upon it well. I ended up getting around 20hours on my play through, I certainly could have stretched that to 30 and there is a lot of replayability. Im confident I couldnt have shortened it quite a lot as well, which i think is a good thing. The game is really tailored around letting you play how you want to play.  Obviously I'd recommend the game. No doubt the port for pc will be fixed very soon, again, i never experienced any issues but I'm sure they are working hard on fixing any issues.   EDIT: I should mention I am running this with 2 980ti's on the highest graphic settings (ultra i believe) and barely ever noticed any framerate drop.

So when Dishonored 2 was announced I was hyped, but after seeing the reviews I thought this game was gonna be just a crappy cash grab. And to be honest I'm disappointed in all these bad reviews.   I do have to acknowledge the fact that there are some big issues with framerate and optimization . In fact I had instances of extreme lag in parts of the game, and I'm some high mid-tier to top-tier parts in my setup. Thing is for us pc player, WE GOTTA GET OVER IT!!!! This game was obviously meant for console, and you just got get off your high horse and deal with it. Controls are sensitive? Well duh, play it with a controller if you hate it. Don't want too? Well then change the controls to how it fits you...  Patches will come, that's how pc gaming works. The game has just released for crying out loud. So let time pass a bit before you bombard it with bad reviews. They will fix it. They always try.  Now onto the actual review, game is a good game. I love it. Definitly lives up to the first game. Maps are big. Your actions control the ending. Different ways of playing, all just like the original. Controls are the same, which I will say sort of sucks but keybinding to the rescue! Basically a bigger, even better looking version of the original game, which I love.   Now what did they update or change? Well to begin with, abilities. New set for Emily and same set for Corvo. Emily's set of abilites are amazing, very unique abilities allowing for very interesting was of taking down foes, but still allowing players to play any way they choose. Corvo's is the same so nothing really to say. Now, the upgrading of the abilities is was really stands out, you can upgrade your abilities based off what you want. Just know. stopping time is great for planning tactics. So get it for Corvo's Blink (Just like Daud's Blink, YEAH BABY!!!) and Emily's Far Reach. Everything else, do as you play.   Maps have dramatically increased in size overall. Which you'd think would make it easier to stealth, right? Nope it's harder because of how open it is, and that is pretty cool (Also enemies are more perseptive, even at normal difficulty, so watch out for them if you're playing stealthily). Added bone charm and rune crafting, awesome. Great way to amp up play styles. Also made keeping specific Chaos levels easier. which is nice when going for a low chaos run.   Overall it's a good game. If you're not a pretentious snob, who expects godlike perfection right out of the box for a pc port. Then I'd recommend it, for the snobs. BTFO UNTIL IT MEETS YOUR STANDARDS. Then play it.",

Personally, I think they could've made the non-lethal options more apparent, but they were always there. Really open world, on this one. There was never a situation where I couldn't go somewhere I wanted to. Gameplay - 10/10 Story - 9/10 Replayability - 10/10 Open Worldness - 10/10  This is one of my favourite games ever.",

Dishonored 2 is a FANTASTIC game. We all know the problems with the performance and I certainly don't approve of how they handled the game's PC launch; however, now that I've installed the beta patch and begun playing it runs buttery smooth on my GTX 970, and the gameplay is absolutely sublime.   The biggest drawback of the game in my opinion is the story, honestly. Perhaps I just haven't gotten far enough in it yet, but there doesn't seem to be as much of a sense of revenge building up in the player throughout the game like in Dishonored 1. In the first game, you initially want revenge on Daud and the Lord Regent, but then you're betrayed and your lust for revenge gets even stronger. In this game, other than wanting revenge on Delilah, there isn't much that drives me.  However, what DOES drive me is the gameplay and level design. Both are expertly crafted, with power usage responsive and allowing for even more creative ways to deal with your opponents than was possible in Dishonored 1, which was already an enormous number. Add that on top of Emily's powers, and this game has a lot of replayability.   If it didn't have the initial performance issues, it would be a 10/10 from me. But alas, I'll have to knock one point off.  9/10 - DO BUY if you're into stealth games or anything like them",

The mansion where you can switch back and forth between the past and the present is one of the best levels I've played in my life. There are multiple solutions to all problems and lots of hidden missions in the books and overheard conversations. The game is brutally hard until you get some of the magic powers so don't judge by the first level. Fall damage is stupidly high considering the verticality of the maps and leads to save-scum frustration. Some level design decisions are a bit killjoy-ish, often funelling you into the front door where D1 would have give you 5 alterative and smarter ways (some that you'd discover on your 5th replay).  Art direction is fantastic though the graphics themselves aren't *that* huge an improvement over D1, and everyone knows about the appalling optimisation issues at the moment (1080+6700=40FPS at times). The biggest negative with D2 for me is the story which is much less focused than D1, so it's just kill target A to get name of target B, rinse and repeat until the short closing cinematics. The opening premise is stretched and does not help to get you to suspend disbelief. I miss the exposition of a 'Samuel the boatman' type figure or the 'party camp' feel of the Hound Pits base (D2's ship is a pale shadow of this). These all give you a purpose beyond simply 'beating a brilliantly designed level'.   ",

The game is actually quite hard if you want it to be, which is really good. There are a very large amount of ways to complete each level as both Emily and Corvo, and you're able to make every takedown as unique as you want it to be. The charm system is very well done, and the results of fully collecting every bone charm can be shown in what you craft. The whole game offers a large amount of replay value, along with being longer than the first Dishonored.   The setting and style of the game is unique and enjoyable (I have a weakspot for steampunk). The levels are very cleverly designed, and there are multiple parts of different levels that blew my mind (   Jindosh Mansion, Timepiece Level  ).

DisHonored II is everything great about the first and then some.  Set 15 years after the first game it continues to story of Corvo and Emily, this time giving you the choice of who you play as. I, of course, picked Corvo. He simply seems like the correct choice.  I really like that the story brings in characters and elements from the first game's DLC chapters and makes them main players now.  Add in the game looks fantastic. It still maintains the beautiful oil painting look of the first game, only far more detailed. Better lighting, animations... it's a gorgeous game.   And the gameplay feels far more balanced. Opting for a non-lethal playthrough feels far more balanced then it did in the first game, now that you have more options for taking out enemies in a non-lethal manor.  It's hard to really break down, but this is everything fans wanted from a DisHonored sequel. And I can't wait to play more.   But now... issues.   As of release, the PC version is not what most wanted. There are performance issues and mouse aim/movement issues. And these are frustrating, annoying and can even be irritating.  As of right now, it doesn't seem to matter what settings I use the game runs almost exactly the same. When it's at 60fps it's fantastic. But, there's something off in the game's frame pacing. With v-sync off, it doesn't matter what the FPS is, 45 or 105... it doesn't feel smooth.  Yet, with v-sync on, so long as it's at 60 it feels great. But, the second it drops to 55fps it feels jittery.   Now, Arkane have already commented and stated a fix is coming in the 'coming days' which will address performance issues and mouse movement problems.  But, even with these issues I can still easily recommend this game to those mature enough to see the brilliant game despite the few rough edges.  EDIT: With the release of the latest Beta patch the game has become far more enjoyable. Easier to obtain a solid 60fps, and with far less frame rate drops and hiccups. Arkane are in the right path to making this game a classic in every way.",

PROS: -EVERYTHING ELSE!!! ------------------------    I bought Dishonored 2 ignoring all these negative reviews because most were about bad optimization and whatnot.   To set the record straight -- the game IS NOT poorly optimized, you're just too big of a mongloid to adjust the settings properly or simply think you can run the game maxed out with a 2010 computer/components.   The only problem is the mouse smoothing/acceleration, which is EASILY FIXED by enabling V-Sync. Yes, you will limit your FPS but who cares? Those 60 locked frames are just perfect for this game because it's not a game about admiring the graphics or the scenery, but sneaking around and carefully getting past (or getting rid of) the enemies and of course it's gameplay aka combat system.  That being said, it's the only CON in my eyes (and also a HUGE drop in performance when alt-tabbing/minimizing out of the game + maybe falling and then using Far Reach which weridly bounces you randomly and you don't always end up where you wanted to).   Putting that aside, I run the game on preset (Very High mostly everything (shadows and water quality being on High and lens flare + all that disabled) and I get 100 FPS minimum if I disable V-Sync. I have a GTX 1070 G1, 16GB RAM, i7 3770 and W7.  The story is fine, the visuals and gameplay are smooth and fun and it's a big upgrade from the 1st. Considering you can choose from 2 characters and with that the play style, it's damn awesome. A lot of replay value and the amount of different approaches you can take to complete your mission just makes you coming back for more. Of course the achievements are also something you shouldn't ignore and just add up to all the fun you can have from the game.    I definitely recommend the game, however, keep in mind it's a demanding so I wouldn't really recommend buying it if you don't have the newest graphics card or a somewhat powerful PC (even with the older GPU). That aside, I personally don't think the game is worth it's original price and I never would have paid it. In my opinion, it's worth around 40€ but not 60€.",

If it's the former I'd love to get some feedback to improve future reviews. Thanks!  bought on GMG. So I think this will show up as a key activation review?   I'm loving this game. Full stop - the visual design of the world is exceptional, and the gameplay is thoroughly engaging. Each mission introduces a new structural problem - you never feel like you're playing the same mission over and over. Each one is fresh, and recalls the best of Thief 2.   The high level story is weak, which I think is a consequence of having interchangeable protagonists. I don't know how you tell a meaningful story where the lead character is replaceable. BUT the NPC character stories are exceptional. Mission 7's hero NPC is a particular stand out - I was really moved by the nuance presented in that character's backstory.   Definitely had stability problems, but solved them by lowering presets. I've got a 970, 16gb ram, a beefy i7 and have to keep video settings at 'medium.' The game looks amazing even at that level, and I maintain 60fps all through, but it's been a little frustrating to not be able to see the game in its full glory. But the art direction here is *so good* that it shines through even when some of the visual bells and whistles are turned down.   Looking forward to NG+!",

The game has optimisation issues. Mouse is oddly tied with FPS. Currently the Developers are aware that some users the game isn't working as intended. And are working on a patch that should be released within a few days.   For what I have played. The voice acting is good, Graphics are slight improvements over the first. Gameplay has been improved, new abilities along with a new character, Emily. Corvos 'Adopted' Father. Thus you can choose if you wish to play as Corvo or Emily. Emily has different powers, although, alike, are different, she has more steathy approach, where Corvo, can play both.  Would I recommend this game? At its current state its kinda hard to say. If you can find it on other sites for cheaper, yes. Don't buy full price purely for the fact that it has its fair share of problems with optimisations. So keep this in mind while making your purchase. Some users may not experience any problems with FPS, also keep in mind.   Game uses TXAA which is aweful and makes it blurry, luckily you can import Mafia 3 reshade (the most downloaded one) and make the game x10 more beautiful and removes the blurryness that TXAA uses.",

I can only assume people have garbage pc's or just psuedo'd themselves on the hate train before making their own mind up.  The scenery is magnificent, as is the level design. You can navigate entire levels without hitting anybody or even using your abilities, its very hard but very rewarding. Also some of the labyrinth type levels were something I've personally never seen in a game before, it was brilliant rescuing Sokolov.  This game gets a huge thumbs up from me, the storyline isn't anything ground breaking, it all happens a bit fast, 'Yo, im the queen now' 'ermmm... ok cool' the entire empire within seconds now hates you lol, but looking past that, there were a few things in there that kept me on my toes and a nice backstory for the villain which we get to re-live and even change. The numerous ways to play out the storyline again are just brilliant.  I loved this game, and I've only played it through as Emily, can't wait to do corvo this week.

Solid enough controls, fun and engaging combat/stealth mechanics, plenty of options to play how you want (they even let you play without any of the powers). There's an enormous emphasis on replayability since there's no way you're going to be able to unlock every power on one play through, and the game changes quite a bit depending on if you play stealthily or if you kill too many people etc - from enemies that appear, to in-game dialog and events. There's no new game plus or mission selecting, but I've read the devs have considered patching it.  But as of right now, the game runs like crap. On high settings (the third highest), I get about 25-60 FPS. The dips and drops can be very jarring to experience and it's a simple indication that the developers got incredibly lazy with their PC port. Under that simple problem alone, you should NOT buy this game.  Wait for a bit. If they fix it, then they deserve your money. If they don't, their loss.",

Don't get me wrong, the performance is definitely not optimized, but it's far from game breaking. There are two things you can do to fix performance issues:  1. It's very important that, until they patch it, you set your advanced video settings to custom and completely disable Anti-Aliasing. Doing this more than doubled my frame rates. I play with everything else on Ultra, besides Viewing Distance which is set on High.  2. Download (for free) 'Process Lasso.' A part of the problem people are experiencing is due to the game being given low priority in task manager. Process Lasso is a real time optimization utility. You will want to set Dishonored 2 to high priorirty.  I have come across some inconsequential moments where the frame rates have dropped as low as the 30, but this has only happened three times so far and never in the places that matter. The frame rate drops I've experienced have all been outside of combat, not in big areas, but rather in small spaces or indoors where my character is often alone. They also don't last long. Split seconds.  Other than those few hiccups, I've been able to maintain steady 60fps at 1080p HD (on Ultra and I don't even have top of the line hardware). The gameplay itself is great and the combat mechanics, as always, are some of the best. I like the addition of a new character and actually really enjoy her move set.

It differs between 27-150fps all of the time.  Basically, if you enjoyed the first game (like me) or if you just want to try out a new stealth/action game set in a steampunk world with superpowers, gadets, a good story and a real cool artstyle, and at the same time can oversee a few framedrops here and there, this is most definitley a great game for you!  8/10, would recommend!",

I do feel a bit OP and reviews seem to reflect the same opinion. I have to say that the GFX in this game have really blown me away. From the SSS on characters to highly detailed environments, this is the first game in a long time to drop my jaw.  Now the elephant in the room. Optimization. I've got almost 10hrs in on this game and have experienced no issues at all gameplay wise. Maybe a bit of micro-stutter in cutscenes and cursor movement in menus. Other than that it's played well.

Honestly, I thought the game was an improvement over the first. AI seems to be smarter (they will look in closets, under tables, and re-act smarter to the environment). The game lets you avoid combat all together (I never used combat, I finished without killing anyone) in true dishonored fashion. The game builds on concepts from the first game (many theories were confirmed in this, and opens up more possibilites for the future of the series). Overall, I like where this series is going and I look forward to replay this game.  However, I kinda feel like the game was a bit too similiar to the first, lore wise. You have the same concepts as before. Another coup, a leading person framed for a murder (in this case, murders), a plague (in the form of bloodflies), zombie-esque dangers (in the form of keepers). I feel like the story itself could have been done without being so similiar to the first one, but it honestly isn't that bad when you actually start playing the game.  While it is a bit too similiar for my liking, it goes in great directions. Using an egomaniac's own inventions to make him forget how to make robots. Exploring a ruined mansion through two different time periods with the chance to change the present. A beautiful and large modern home that somehow fits into the game world.

Or I might play as a psychotic Corrvo - angry at the world - but then have an urge to go back to super-stealth mode assassin. It is really fun.  The levels are designed amazingly. So many opportunities, so many routes, so many ways to kill or sneak past - just an all around fun game - especially if you liked the first one. I would give it 9/10.

Emily's powers set her apart from Corvo so running two playthroughs for each character won't feel redundant. I also like the fact that there is an option to go through the game with no powers for those hardcore players out there. I don't think that was in the previous game but I might be wrong. It's the game I've been waiting for ever since finishing up the first one.

I couldn't stand how people have been talking about how crappy the game movement is when on my PC it is quite nice. A definite improvement from the first Dishonored.

I mean did you read the recommended or minimum specs at all? Christ! Don't blame the developers and save some dough for a better system! or play on a console and stop complaining!

Gameplay - Major improvement from Dishonored. Not only can you play any style you wish, you can play them twice over with 2 characters, giving plenty of replayability. Dishonored was roughly this. Grind Runes, get all abilities. Beat the game.  This game improves on that. now its - Find runes along the way (hunt them for those dedicated), carefully invest to certain passive and active abilities, make the best build you want for your playstyle, BE A BADASS... improving on the more pacifist material in the game is a great addition. non lethal combat takedowns save the restarting previous saves syndrome for those who dont mind getting seen.   The only downside i would have is how the enemy NPS'C Daredevil Hearing quickly changes your chances of survival from a fair fight to 12 men executing you with their elite guard sniper training.... with pistols.... you could start a 1 on 1 in a house and 7 seconds later the whole map of enemies is poking your body with their sharp metal sticks...  Enviorment - Much more choice then ever! rip shít up like chuck norris Hulksmashing his way through the guards, sneaky snaking through the rooftops, bloodfly infested buildings, no ♥♥♥♥♥er would dare follow you thropugh those, drainpipes, rat tunnels, swamp shít diving, open mountain badass superjumping. you make your way through the levels YOUR WAY....

To wrap this up.... - This game is definatley worth the money, ignore those who complain, just have a decent machine and the game will run.. if not, wait for the patch bethesda are slaving over to make the game compatable with Lower end gear... 6.2 hours as of this review, plenty of time to notice 'bad performance' just for god sake, i cannot ♥♥♥♥♥ing stress this enough.... have the RECOMENDED requirments to play this game. anything less is a big risk. or play it on console...

Yes, I understand that you may feel youselves fooled for buying a pre-order version of the game installing it on i7/gtx1070/16gb ram stuff and experiencing performance issues. Although I didn't experience so severe performance (despite being it very low on i5/radeon r7 270x/24 gb ram) and the game was playable. So after all, all those negative opinions on the title regarding only performance should be deleted or marked somehow so that it does not affect the overall score.  My feelings about the game, I didn't feel myself so stunned while playing this as I have experienced it with the first part. Maybe because of the linear plot that tells you what is the main focus in the gameplay since the very first minutes. Improved combat and stealth skills compared to the first part are a definitely positive aspect of the game. Adding a second playable character is an awesome idea (starting Emily campaign soon) however I miss the solution from Assassin's Creed Syndicate when you could switch freely between Jacob and Evie.  Although it seems to be a little bit worse than Dishonored 1 (or maybe I was too much hyped for the continuation) it is still a solid game with a great storyline.

It hits some really good points and even on medium difficulty it's very difficult. The missions are amazing and feel great. It's slightly..

Why do we have to fight her now? +Seriously, killing her was a pain, why is she alive? +Did I waste my money on the DLC? +Starting bone charms are useless (the ones for the pre-order)  Would I recommend: Yes. Does it need work: Yes.  But as always it wouldn't be a Bethesda game... Oh right: It's not a Bethesda game.

My game went up near 7GB of RAM just when in an open area on the Ultra Preset with the NVidia HPO+ enabled. I do notice some frame tearing here and there, but disabling V-Sync (enabled by default; developers, please stop doing this), playing with some minimal settings, making sure you have the latest drivers, and making sure to close things you don't need so you can have all the RAM in the system avalible (or most of it) to this game.

Stealthwise, of course you can compare to the almighty and far superior Thief series, but that is the grand daddy and more stealth orientated than anything else so you have more stealth options with it. Graphics wise, i personally think it looks washed out, just truly awfully optimised and the aliasing/anti makes your eyes bleed, all in all a bit like the awful looking Mafia 3. Dunno if they are going for this look or if it's just a port problem, but it does look at times a bit 'off'. Runs at 70-80 fps on V High-Ultra on my 2nd rig with an r9 270 ocx e and i7 4770 3.4ghz, but some frame rate drops still happen as others have reported. Not a bad game, but nothing great, combat feels disconnected and not satisfying and the AI are overly sensitive or just plain stupid. If indeed it is supposed to be an 'AAA' title, it falls way short. I have seen it on a gtx 1080 briefly, but doesn't look anything special imo. Wait for a patch or drivers maybe, and a cheaper copy.

With a moderate OC on my GPU and adjustive resolution set to manual at 60, I can get a solid 50fps on ultra settings. There's so much more to the gameplay than there was in Dishonored 1, but it's in the same taste so it just feels right. At first I was kind of overwhelmed by how much larger the maps are and how many runes and bonecharms are to get an how much smarter the enemies are, but now that I've played more I really like it.  TL;DR: If you liked the first one, buy this one.  ORIGINAL PRE-BETA PATCH REVIEW: I never buy games at full price (and never review games either), but I loved the first Dishonored so much I pre-ordered Dishonored 2. I was pumped to play it at midnight 11/10 when it became available a day early for pre-orders. There are many neat changes about the game, but I cannot truly enjoy it because even on Very Low settings my mid-level gaming rig can barely reach 30 fps (if that) in normal gameplay and in combat even less. The graphics are far better than the first one, but not enough to where this should be happening. If I can run all my other games (such as Battlefield 4, Crysis 2, etc.) maxed out at 60+ fps, then I should be able to run this well. I will be playing through the first Dishonored (for my fourth time) until they (hopefully) release an update to fix this horribly unoptimized game/game engine.

The game is now quite playable, changing my review to recommended for addressing this quickly. I have also found that the game uses quite a lot of GPU memory, on medium and high it goes very close to 4GB, and on a 970gtx the memory over 3.5GB is quite a lot slower than the first 3.5 gb, so unless you can be saved by very fast RAM, that will cause some drops from 60 fps.

Controls don't feel all that sluggish anymore, but i can still see the motion blur, though not as bad, might've gotten used to it slightly after a while. Quicksaves are still glitchy.  That said though, the patch was still 12 days too late. Something like this should be fixed on day one. Theres no way in hell, that they didn't know about this horrible performance in the years it took to develop this game. Plus its more than shady that Bethesda stopped giving out review copies to their games just before this game came out. I'm blaming Bethesda on that one and give Arkane the benefit of the doubt.  Remember: Don't preorder games, and ♥♥♥♥ like this doesn't happen. ESPECIALLY don't preorder from Bethesda.  Also: Bethesda just 'Rereleased' the game on steam. Basically shoving into your face that the game is now fixed. You only get one try, bethesda. And don't you dare label all those negative reviews as 'pre-release'.    Original:  The base gameplay is great. Probably better than the first game, which was already superb, if there wasn't the elephant in the room.  In terms of performance, this game is absolutely abysmal. The framerate is all over the place, the controls are sluggish, there is some serious motion blur which some people say is from the severe input lag there is.  I'm tried playing both on the 'recommended' settings as well as the lowest settings possible. The change had barely any impact on my performance.  You know how there is kind of an emphasis on playing how you want to? Stealthy or more agressive? Right now you are forced to play stealthy, because any fight will slow down your framerate to a crawl.  I've seen enough glitches in the first 3 hours (the first hour was screwing around in the options menu), from enemies teleporting a few meters after you got spotted, to them being alerted by seemingly nothing after you quickload a save.   Bethesda/Arkane Studios have said that they are 'working on a fix'. A fix that should've been there at the very least on the day of release. And knowing Bethesda and the amazing state of their other games (minus DOOM, which was Id Software), this fix will never come.   Should the devs wake up and suddenly think that customers may want a working product from their purchase, i'll update this review. Right now though you should not waste 60€ on this.  If you've made the horrible mistake of pre-ordering this mess, i would strongly recommend refunding it and waiting for the patch or a big discount.",

In ourdoor areas ive had to rely on glitching to ledges to avoid mobs because if i was to try properly stealth with unstable FPS i wouldn't have a hope. I'm disgusted with this release, i'm disgusted with the patch time. I have tried every way possible to play this and cannot be ♥♥♥♥ed until they admit and fix their faults. I give consideration to small devs with issues, not to Bethesda who have money oozing from every oraphace.   Decided to drag the Ol' tower over to my 4K tv to play  Dishonored tonight upon release, didn't expect major fps but thought I could tweak the settings enough to get it running smoothly.

Did a small stable OC and got no benefit, reverted back to factory OC. Sammy SSD.  Well, that seems not the case, initially had it going at 50 fps, ultra 4K in the tutorial, jumped for joy. Soon moved onto a more so intensive area and decided to start dropping my settings, nothing made a major difference, because at no point was this going to be stable enough to play.  Thought screw it, I'll play it 1920x1080 and be satisfied, well on ultra I'm getting 45 and below fps, when just simply running can dip to 10fps and you all know that's unplayable haha.  I've updated my nvidia driver, which claims it has optimisation already for dishonored, (cannot get the game to scan in it)  I'll be honest I've even gone to the extent of dropping the major performance settings right down and still getting horrible performance.  My vsync is off for obvious reasons using the tv. I'm not running hbao, even tried adaptive resolution *shudders*.   This is gonna need a big patch, I complained on mafia 3's release of a 30fps lock, but damn least I could play it haha!

However, I cannot speak for everyone's experience. IF you're below the recommended, I would suggest waiting a few weeks to pick it up until they iron the issues out. Hell, maybe wait even if you ARE above the recommended.  Update -2 11/14/16 - I've been very patient. I paused my playthrough waiting for a stablization patch to fix the issues reported by gaming outlets. It's been nothing but radio silence from Arkane since the patch was announced. Such simple things such as graphical pre-sets not taking effect is not cool on the Devs part, and I'll be switching this review to Not Recommended until it's resolved.  Update -3 11/24/16 - I've waited and I've gone back into the game. On the small test I took (strolling around the Dust district) I'm now pleasently surprised that my 980 is running the game with all settings maxed out @ 60 FPS at 1920x1080. Switching the review back to recommended. Still gotta give some ♥♥♥♥ to Arkane for taking as long as they did, and not having this stuff fixed before hand.  == Original review w/ Updates below ==  People seem to think that because it won't run on their Grand mama's toaster that the game is poorly optimized. i7 6700K, Gigabyte Windforce GTX 980 3X OC, most settings maxed out (including AA) with HBAO+ off, game has yet to dip below 70 FPS at any time. Take 'LEL BAD OPTIMIZASHUN' complaints with a grain of salt, probably the same crowd who ruined Deus Ex: Mankind Divided's reviews. Doubly so considering the release date hasn't actually hit yet, and that the Dev's can only account for so much without testing the game in the wild. I will update this as I get further into the game.  Update 1: So far, after playing for 9-10 hours as I'm writing this, my only complaint(s) are these. First is that it doesn't seem to like my particular dual monitor set up (I have my main in my GPU and my second in my Mobo because it's an an old 1400x1050 VGA monitor) but that was fixed after a restart. The second is that they didn't do a lot to the powers. They added some new ones yes, but none that I feel would benefit me except for one, otherwise I've been getting away clean with my core powers from Dishonored 1 (Blink, Dark Vision and Agility + the new one, Domino)  On the technical side, I've encountered no bugs except the dual montior issue (which might be me) and that I fell through an elevator and took a small amount of damage in the Addelmire level. The sound of the game is just awesome, it feels different but the same (which works for a game set 15 years after the first) The graphics aren't the most spectacular I've ever seen, but thats because I did end up having to downgrade some stuff, even after getting out of the prologue. I'm also still playing on a 1920x1080 monitor, though, too. So far I'll say what I said when DXMD came out. If you're on the fence because of other people crying 'bad optimization' or 'poor port' then wait about a week or two, let Arkane do their jobs and fix what they could not account for.  Update 2: So far, so frustrating. Maybe it's an issue with just Emily, but this auto-target for powers is some of the most frustrating ♥♥♥♥ ever. I can't count the number of times so far that I've had a clear get away from a hairy situation get screwed over because instead of blinking to the ledge that I'm aiming at, the autoaim is making me aim at the ground below me, causing me to go face first back into what I'm trying to get AWAY from. At one point, I wasn't even in a hurry, just trying to blink up to a ledge that was right in front/above me. I aimed up at the ledge (just out of Jumping distance, even with Agility) and the game kept aiming my Far Reach at the ground, and trying to jump then cast did less than nothing to help. Whats worse is that there doesn't seem to be a way to toggle this crap at the very least.  I've encountered another bug since my last update.    I was working towards Kirin Jindosh's mansion to rescue Sokolov    and had successfully knocked out a majority of people in my way, except for this one guy with his back to me at a check point. I waited until his friend passed by hidind behind the wall, but was somehow seen through the metal wall, anyway. Okay, then. I managed to reorient myself and avoid detection at that instance, only for him to walk to my side, then clip through the door onto my head and start attacking me.",

If you liked Dishonored, chances are you're gonna enjoy Dishonored 2 a great deal.   Gameplay-wise pretty much everything was improved upon from the first game as far as I can tell. It feels more sleek, combat is even more brutal and impactful, and non-lethal playstyles are more versatile now. Absolutely no complaints on this front, the game feels great to play.  What I will say though is that I didn't quite get the amazing atmosphere from the first game (this is mostly due to the game's setting), and the story and characters (with some exceptions) didn't feel as strong in Dishonored 2 compared to its predecessor. This is just personal opinion, of course, but for me Dishonored (one of my absolute favorite games of all time) will remain the more beloved game of the franchise.  All in all, wheter you are a veteran of the first game like I am, or a newcomer to the series, I can only recommend this title.",

The actual game is really pretty awesome, with an engaging plot and interesting people and locations. Im hoping this patch comes soon and corrects the framerate, which seems to be the main issue.  My system: 2x GTX 1070, 6700k, 32GB RAM. Im lucky if I get 40 FPS which sucks on a 144hz display.  Update: Patch 1.2 has brought the performance up some. However the FPS spikes are still present, not nearly as bad though. Frames are between 48 and 144. The game is fantastic and if your a fan of the first game I highly recommend.",

Thank you for the post-release support, Arkane!   ** FIRST POST **  Love this game so far, just having issues with the performance. Framerates tend to be sluggish in 1080p on low settings and bumping the presets up to ultra doesn't cause too much of a drop, weirdly enough. The most notable framerate tank occured when on the skiff between the ship and Karnaca in the first mission.  Processor: i7-4790 @ 3.6 GHz RAM: 16 GB GPU: 2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 (MSI)  *EDIT* After some tweaking with the most recent nVidia driver, I finally got the game to run again (it was an issue with GeForce Experience, go figure). I can use some third party software to help stabilize the framerate for the most part, but it still tanks every now and then. Here's to hoping for post-patch stability!",

I would recomend waiting and getting it at a cheaper price as it really is more of the first game. Gameplay is more important then story with all the lore being found in collectable books with the story being a quick discription of the next target due to being able to play as either Corvo or Emily.  Corvo and Emily do have varying abilites so playing through as both would be fun but the first game offers a better story over a longer game.   I ran the game fine on medium graphics with only one frame rate stutter during my playthorugh. Fun game, not worth the $100 they are asking for it.",

Also replay value is really high, different play styles, endings, mission solvings, two diffrent heroes, new game +.  And then there is tecnical side of it. I did have some FPS drops but quite rarely. Everything on veryhigh. More patches in january, so I am quite sure game will get fixed.  Really good game!!!",
