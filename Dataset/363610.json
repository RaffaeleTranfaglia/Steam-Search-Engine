            "review_text": "The level design is quite alright and the story is partly reasonable. If you die on a mission you don't have to repeat tasks again. So much for the pro side. On the bad side: The aiming is a nightmare because, the crosshair isn't aligned with the center of the screen and your weapon. Voice acting... how shall I put it? It's late 20th century text to speech. Do yourself a favor and turn it off. The inventory is an untidy chaos, using it is suicide while in hostile areas. Some of the achievements don't work. Rating 3/ 10 Cards: six",
