            "review_text": "Gosh, what a bad game... If anybody needs proof that a match-3 puzzle game isn't the kind of thing where you can afford to be a lazy programmer, then here it is.  PROS: - None. Quite rare for me, as I'm easy to please when it comes to gaming.  CONS: - The gameplay is a mix between 'Clickomania' (a very old match-3 game, and certainly not the most exciting kind) and 'modern' match-3's with powerups and other silly things. But Clickomania's main interest was based on whether you could remove all of the tiles from a board without any lockups. You know, an actual puzzle... There's no such thing here, and lockups most likely happen at the beginning of a stage when very few blocks are available to click on. Then the level just reshuffles, very slowly. And it's not even our fault... - Sometimes when a level ends, nothing happens. You actually have to click the Menu button, then Resume, for the game to find its way again. And if it shows you an achievement, then you have to do it twice. - Story is ridiculous. It's only told through a simple block of text at the beginning of each season (series of levels). I didn't get any story panel for Autumn, which is either a solid bug, or even more laziness on their side. - The first season is mostly dedicated to tutorials, but you get rainbow blocks in a few levels before they're properly introduced. - Clicks don't always register. A mortal sin for a match-3. In fact, there is no feeling of pleasure when you click stuff. - The music is bland and generic, the graphics are passable in general but blocks themselves vary from okay to very ugly. And since you'll be spending most of your time watching them, hmm... - Power-ups are incorrectly explained. Seriously, did the game bug and forget to tell me something? - Some levels are hard and annoying (requiring you to wait for animations to complete so you can actually reach a single tile), and are followed by a very easy level. Where's the difficulty curve? - Levels require you to click a certain amount of blocks of every color, but they also ask you to finish something that wasn't explained everywhere and that was expressed in percentage values... Okay... Except you have to get that value to zero, rather than 100. At that point, the game designer may very well be a misunderstood genius. - When you complete a level, the game says it was level '2-1' (first episode, season 2) when the bottom of the screen gives you a sequential number (16). Quality check, anyone?! - Level time limits are so short (even in relaxed mode, where running out of time doesn't end the level), that you can't help but think that they expect you to click mindlessly everywhere. - Animations are so slow that you not only click mindlessly, you click *randomly* because you don't know in advance how many blocks will be removed by clicking them.  I just couldn't get myself to complete the quest mode. In fact, I'd be ashamed to finish it, because it would mean I got some pleasure out of it. Definitely not worth the $0.8 I paid for it.",

From my experience, it is actually a good game with some pretty good time into it, but not really clear about its intentions. My mom does not speak english, so, once she finished the Quest mode, she actually thought the game was over and didn't see the arcade mode. The game should make it clearer that there is another mode that is different from the quest mode.  The graphic is ok, the pieces from the game are not really well made, but they are ok. The game has some nice art on the characters and overall the stages backgrounds.  The game is also pretty cheap and gets even cheaper with sales. If you like this type of match 3 game, I think it is nice to get this one.",
