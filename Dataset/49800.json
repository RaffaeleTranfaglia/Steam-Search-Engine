With an uncooperative teammate on your team, it can ruin the game, because it depends so much on teamwork. if one person refuses to do their job, you're going to lose. But with the right teammates, you can have lots of fun evading and outgunning the enemy.",

You then choose what route to follow for the next 'mission', almost like in Outrun.  It's an interesting game for an hour or two, but it is not going to stay on your hard drive for long. ",

My brother even laughed at me because he said it looked really dumb. But I enjoy the process of predicting where the enemies will move and then firing with teh delay of an artillery cannon.  The game is very simple, but it's fun. You'll know within 5 minutes whether you like the game or not.",
