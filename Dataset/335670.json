            "review_text": "I just finished Austin Jorgenson's LISA and can say that, without a doubt, it is among the strongest indie RPGs I have ever played. I was hooked on the world of LISA with the slight taste given by the prequel, LISA: The First, which had me eagerly awaiting this title. The developer cites Mother as a key influence and that shows, but even more than the abstract game OFF, LISA has taken the wacky humor and surreal style of Mother into a dark and very adult place. Dingaling is able to take simple, old school pixels and work them into truly disturbing imagery. Lately, we have been inundated with post-apocalyptic settings that are xeroxed and re-sampled at will: zombies, plague, fallout and bad weather. All of those settings, done to death, are fairly grim, but none of them can even touch the misery suggested by LISA. Here we have a world where women are extinct and the surviving men, seeing no future for humanity, have transformed the society into a sort of prison yard where hopelessness is drowned in drugs and alcohol, and memories seem uniformly sad. The main protagonist, Brad, is driven by a past filled with abuse and grief, and literally sets himself against the will of the entire world. The player will be forced to make tough decisions in this game and to eventually think about and judge the outcome. Even as we laugh at sight gags and endless pro wrestling references, one cannot ignore the uneasy slithering quality of LISA. My greatest hope is that the game does well and Dingaling games develops more titles where the heart of the game is a great story, not the ability to snipe someone in multiplayer. Bravo!",

            "review_text": "With all the hype for Undertale, it's a shame that this game passed under the radar last year for many people.  LISA is an RPG that'll make you hate life. No, not by its difficulty, as its pretty basic as far as RPGs go, but by how cruel and sadistic the world it presents to you is. It feels strange how this obscure indie game creates a more believable and interesting post-apocolyptic world than Fallout ever did. It's genuiley threatening and disturbing, despite its silly Earthbound-esque vibe. I never thought an RPG maker game could give me an actual sense of dread.  Tons of party members, satisfying combat, tons of abilities with their own unique animations, funny moments, scary moments, sad moments, and a story that'll leave you satisfied and empty at the same time.  This game is actually the sequel to another game, known as LISA: the First. A Yume-Nikki style game that contains fun topics such as child ♥♥♥♥ and abuse. It's not necessary to play that game to fully understand the story, but it's still worth a look. Be warned, both these games can be pretty graphic.",

            "review_text": "Note: Do not play 'Lisa: The Joyful' first. It's intended as the finale to this game 'Lisa: The Painful' I haven't played Joyful at the time of this writing. TLDR This game is worth playing if you're tired of bad storytelling in video games and want something eccentric and unique unto itself.  It's hard to write about the game without spoiling some of it, but I won't name critical points. It's a RPG with a 4 slot party system, EXP, levels, and mixing and matching party members as you discover them throughout an apocalyptic world populated entirely by men and all that entails. It's a very *human* world, twisted through a bizarre tone that expresses itself through experimental and sometimes grossly unnerving music, the art, and the mechanics especially.  Great care's taken in making every single party member have their own theme and flavor. Even mechanics tied to resting in the wilderness speak to the game's theme of pain and hostility. To say this game is quirky and bizarre is an understatement though. I felt a constant sense of tension and unease as I played, but I think that was largely the point.  Plenty of humor kept it from beating me over the head with constant reminders that the world's screwed, and my main character's drug addiction getting in the way and tempting me to feed his demons. There is a drug called Joy that gives party members, and your permanent player-character, massive bonuses and chases off the heavily penalizing withdrawal status effects.  I'd highly recommend this game to anybody who loves quirky humor and darker, adult themes. It truly was a horror, and there are very few heroics to speak of except for the silly boys that made up their own rules in a traumatized wasteland that's both horrific and playful.   It's our Earth alright?  I could go over every little detail on why this game is more human than the trite Good vs Evil nonsense that typically plays out in other stories, but the sweaty wonderland is best experienced with an open mind.   ---   Other boring notes:  Didn't 100% the game, don't plan on doing a Pain-Difficulty run.  Did read spoilers post-ending.  Took about 15 hours blind on Normal difficulty, missed several areas in that time.  Some of them are very well-hidden, so if you like mystery and exploring the overworld based on NPC hints, you'll probably feel pretty clever for your experimenting!",

            "review_text": "I have played and beat the pre-release of LISA two times and now again for the third time on steam. I will try to collect my thoughts, that gathered up during that time with the game, into this review. I will try to avoid spoilers.  LISA without a doubt is a  very special game . It is one man's passion project. (scroll to the end for TL:DR version)   THE PRICE:  Special games such as this are rarely made to completion, and when they are, their nature is such that it demands concessions.  This is a technically weak game for what people might expect from a commercial title, options are scarce, controller setup highly counter intuitive, resolution non-adjustable, and full-screen mode hard set. It has all the issues you might expect from a game made on a RPG-maker platform, such as an antiquated battle system and very rigid platforming.  If technical shortcomings of a game turn you off, I would like to suggest that they shouldn't, as a game is not a car or a tool judged upon its specs primarily, however if you are not willing to make some concessions to a game over its technical aspect LISA is not for you.   THE VISION:   'The state of nature is such where there is &lt;...&gt; no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.'  -Thomas Hobbes  Such is the view of life we find in LISA, it is cheap, plentiful, yet brief and ends ignobly in violence. The game mechanics work in concert with the narrative splendidly here, by offering plenty of wonderfully varied and interesting companions to recruit, all with a distinct look and behavior, you could even swear each has a deep and sorrow filled backstory even when they don't, it is all to easy to get attached to these men before they die permanently.  People almost act like a secondary currency, you soon find out that your allies are just another resource that you expend to get where you need to go, but thankfully they never feel like that, making each death at least somewhat painful.  While gameplay and narrative work together great, LISA's  story is its greatest asset   hands down. What at first seems like a regular 'save the damsel' story, is actually so much more. Some minor spoilers coming:  The only girl character- 'Buddy' is a messiah character, she is the only known female, and is seen as someone who can 'save' the world. However, you (as Brad) want to save HER from the world she is meant to save.   The game asks, what is the dignity of a child? Should a world that can produce nothing but misery be allowed to perpetuate at the price of yet another innocence? The answers that emerge through gameplay are often truly shocking and makes decision making very hard. These themes of tragedy are suggested to be rooted at the core of all characters you meet, through encounters like with Horace and understanding the backstory of Rando. The villains and allies you have are often more like you than is often comfortable and everyone partakes in a brotherhood of misery.  As you play you may choose to go with this world's depravity or constantly struggle against it, with more or less success, while becoming more enmeshed into this world as it builds on you, thematically and narratively, with its punishing gameplay. It culminates in one of those rare satisfying endings, which was the only video game ending to truly make me cry.  I can not commend and recommend this game enough. Also the game has a gorgeous soundtrack, and tons of secrets, even whole large areas/towns that you wouldn't otherwise find casually playing the game.   TL:DR : The fact of this games existence is worth celebrating and forgiving the inevitable vices it had to possess to ever be made. This game is excellent not for polish, but for its grand, bleak vision and meaningful story, that together make for a truly painful game. [Pain/10]  Advice: I suggest not abusing the 'reload feature' if someone dies, or you make a choice live with it, what is the point otherwise?",

            "review_text": "Hotline Miami posed a very important question, one that I believe resonates with this game. Richard's inquiries to Jacket seem to echo throughout this game, and I caught myself wondering about Richard's questions more and more as the game progressed...  LISA is a game about hurt. You play as Brad, a middle-aged nobody residing in the wastes of a ruined world. Brad lives with his lifelong friends in the middle of nowhere. Olathe, the name given to Brad's homeland before everything was destroyed, is sparse with human life, rife with monsters, and is entirely devoid of women. All except for Buddy.  'Where are we right now?'  LISA is a game about hurt. People will hurt Brad. People will hurt each other. Brad will hurt people. Brad will hurt. It's not uncommon to hurt, especially when it's the end of the world. Although, even in the end of the world people don't like to hurt. Maybe you'll take Joy and forget about all the pain and hurt, because Joy helps you forget - at least temporarily. Plus, when you can forget about everything that makes you so pathetic, then you can truly become strong. Besides, you're not the only one using Joy, and Joy has virtually no side effects - save for withdrawal.  'Why are we having this conversation?'  LISA is a game about hurt. The game begs the question of whether or not a few strong men can save the world from a sea of dip♥♥♥♥♥. Are you a strong man? Will you do the right thing?  LISA is a game about hurt, so you need to ask yourself something...    'Do you like hurting other people?'  ",

The man sees some kids playing with fire and asks me if I can grab a bucket of water and put out that fire. I oblige by grabbing the nearest bucket and tossing the liquid on the kids, setting them aflame. The startled man quickly informs me that I just used his bucket of gasoline, the water one is further up the hill. Panicked, I climb the hill and grab the bucket of water only to return moments later to piles of ashes where the children once were.  They say the road to Hell is paved with good intentions and that would be a fitting tagline for this game. Lisa is a 2D side scrolling RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world full of weird characters and some of the most disgusting degenerates all wrapped up in a charismatically drawn world. Players take control of Brad, a Joy addicted empty husk of a man seeking redemption by raising and safeguarding one of the world’s few remaining females.   Lisa begins with a series of flashbacks to show Brad’s life and how he became the man he is at the start of the game. Bullied as a kid, an abusive father, drug addiction…but all that seemed to have changed when he came across an abandoned infant one day. He brings the child home to his flat to show his friends and they’re all surprised to find out that the child is a female. Brad then enlists his friends to help take care in raising this girl. They build a basement for her, cover her face in a mask to disguise the fact that she’s a female and Brad even comes to grips in taming his Joy habit for the benefit of his new daughter. However, things don’t always go well in this world and Buddy is kidnapped, most of brad’s friends are murdered which sends Brad on a hunt to rescue his daughter. Occasional hilariousness and often a metric ton of depravity ensues.  I found the game full of dark humor and even some touching moments but there are also some deranged portions so some people might be put off by some of the situations that occur. Lisa is pretty much the opposite of last year’s Undertale in overall tone even though this game does have a few life lessons to be learned.  Traveling around the world takes place in 2D; people are met, ladders are climbed and caves are explored all using adequate graphics. The artstyle isn’t impressive but it is creative with a style of its own. There are roughly 30 companions ranging from clumsy wrestlers, to a two-legged fish that is a lawyer. There’s not Obsidian level depth in these characters but each one has a personality of their own which is seen through the level up screens and the initial dialogue. The biggest example of all the differences between the characters come from their abilities in combat. There’s a slew of different weapons, attacks, buffs and debuffs to choose from and it’s almost a challenge to find out which characters deserve a space in the party.  It’s sort of good that the characters aren’t too memorable or that there are so many of them that their abilities are pretty interchangeable because they can be taken and even perma-killed occasionally. There are a couple bosses that have instant death attacks, resting can get one of your party members ransomed for a fee and other unfortunate endings can await the player character’s companions if the player so chooses. Of course, this sort of misfortune often befalls the PC also and the player will be called upon to decide if a companion is worth one of Brad’s limbs. Choosing to disfigure Brad will usually rescue a companion but will limit Brad’s effectiveness in combat by reducing the number of combos he can do.  Combat is turn-based and the various RPG stats determine the order of turns, amount of damage done and accuracy while equipment boosts attack, defense and resistances. It’s all standard fare. The characters’ attacks however, is where the variety comes in with Brad and a few other characters using a button combinations for attacks while others use words to debuff the enemies and others use special abilities with their weapons to be useful. As I mentioned before, it takes a while to swap out characters and test out their abilities but it’s fun to give each character a test run and see what they are capable of.   The game is pretty good when it comes to choice and consequences besides the limb vs companion choices I previously mentioned. I had some somewhat friendly guys approach me and offer to buy some Molotov cocktails from me only to find that they used them in a most heinous way. This prevented me from meeting certain characters and removing what could have been a bunch of side quests from the game.  Another thing I found satisfying is the world’s economy in the game. Porno mags have turned into a form of currency and it’s something that, while found in abundance, isn’t always easy to keep with the party members being ransomed, new characters sometimes taking a large amount to hire them and new equipment being so expensive. There are certain areas in the game that random encounters occur and I could grind my way towards more cash but I gave up my grinding days years ago.  In the end, this game just stuck in my head a lot longer than most RPGs due to the story and the way the world’s situations were handled. Lisa left me wondering if all my decisions were worth it in the end. I still have yet to play through the DLC just because the end of this game has really stuck with me. Lisa does a good job of separating itself from other RPGs but the dark nature might not be right for everyone. ",

LISA is a post-apocalyptic 2D-Sidescrolling RPG (doesn't sound amazing, admittedly) with a really surreal, weird atmoshpere and art-style. I picked up this game for 5 bucks on sale and after finishing it, i think it would have well been worth 20 euros. While the game is less gameplay focused and more of a story-teller it still has some solid turn based (pokemon style) combat. And with that basic design you may soon find yourself beating a really hard boss after 13 tortorous attempts to then just accidentally press [-&gt;] once too often and walking down a cliff into your death. I couldn't help but be reminded a lot of Earthbound (which is also like pokemon is some ways) only that every now and then something REALLY ♥♥♥♥ed up happens. As far as the story goes, we find ourselves in a really surreal unforgiving world where anything that could be labeled as '♥♥♥♥ED UP' might happen. The aforementioned gameplay is solid, somewhat balanced and easy to understand. Another thing to mention is the soundtrack, as this game has an amazing soundtrack (might not be everyone's thing though) with really funky beats and tortured parts. (I recommend you buy this with the Soundtrack if you're into alternative weird music)  Now let's get to the real part:  PROS: -Gripping Storytelling -Solid Gameplay -Nice Characters -Amazing (altough, weird) Soundtrack -Humorous -Really Unforgiving -Unbelievable Detail in Storytelling  CONS: -Writing and Design are a bit wonky at places (nothing major though) -Has there ever been an intuitive Inventory-Screen? -Really Unforgving   If your heart can take a beating every now and then, accompanied by a solid all-round gaming experience, I definitely recommend this game for this laughable price.",

I like to compare LISA to Fallout 3 because along with the obvious comparisons like being a post-apocalyptic world with a variety of strange and scary inhabitants, all with their own motives and reactions to different scenarios, it's also a game where a large spread out world has been designed first, and a great story has been laid softly on top afterwards, which means players will get a lot more or less from the story and world based on what they put into it, and that works really well.

(other than in like. 4 small parts) It has alot of 'mini bosses' where other than more fights less rewards, it's less fights more rewards. And I love it for that. I can't really put into words how perfect this game is. Sucks its overshadowed by other lame indie games like Super Meat Boy, Fez, ect ect. my only two complants is that its a little pricey and the game's world is easy to get lost in. The game has a nice replay value with the new pain mode (adds new bosses, cut scenes, but makes the game harder) but I cant say its loaded with content. I'd say pick it up on a sale. 5 bucks is a steal for this under rated gem.  Also this game is really mean and it will ♥♥♥♥ with you alot.",

The story of Lisa is a heart wrenching experience that few games have come close to offering. The gameplay is stellar and the graphics although somewhat confusing initially, I had fallen in love with after about an hour of gameplay. This game has many characters and personalities you will come care about as your story through Lisa progresses, and the game is aware of this and will take advantage of such things. When games say you will have to make world changing desicions, I often find myself rolling my eyes, but Lisa has desicions that will really push you to the limit; Many of these you will not want to make at all. This is game is the epitome of what a small developor is capable of, all games should thrive to achieve what a game like Lisa has. this game is simple and straightforward on the surface, but once you start that journey into the world of Olathe, be prepared. Lisa is an outstanding game and I cannot recommend this enough. If you want a game with characters that will draw you in and a world that feels so real yet so surreal at the same time, Lisa is the answer.",

            "review_text": "A humorous yet depressing post apocalyptic RPG about surviving a world completely void of woman, filled with perverts and weirdo's, this a sequel to the very lesser known RPG Maker game, 'Lisa The First.' You take control of Brad Armstrong who stumbles upon a female baby named 'Buddy', who is the last hope for this humanity. Being the last female on Olathe, Brad wants to protect her from harm's way. As she grows older, her curious mind lets loose after years of being sheltered, and she inevitably gets captured. Brad set's out to save his adopted daughter, while the Painful journey begins.  Living up to it's name, Lisa 'The Painful', is a game all about sacrifice. Being an Earthbound inspired RPG, the humorous tone is very apparent. Lisa crosses boundaries that not many other games have crossed, some moments you'll laugh, but some you'll be gravely upset with. There are a lot of instances where you don't know what to think, along with sometimes being outright disturbed. I believe this is one thing I really enjoyed about Lisa, it really crossed those boundaries that too many games shy away from these days. It's important to note the sacrifice in this game that I mentioned earlier, you'll have the choice of sacrificing limbs, killing off party members, or maybe ditching all your items. These can end up being legitimately difficult decisions that will affect the gameplay no matter what choice you choose.  What seperates Lisa from other RPG Maker games, is that it's set on a 2D plane. You'll eventually obtain a bicycle which will make for faster transportation. You could call it 'Metroidvania' in the sense where you'll have to backtrack to some areas with your newely accquired items, though it's a lot less complicated, with each crossroad consisting of 4-6 areas you'll be able to visit, making it easier to backtrack to areas without it being a hassle. It's also important to note how Lisa always gives you this feeling of being unsafe. Sleeping at campfires overnight can cause negative effects the next day, such as being poisoned. With over 30 recruitable party members comes with a price, some can leave you over night while resting, and some can end up getting captured. The battle system is your typical RPG stuff, although with few neat things added in. For one, Brad can string together combo's while bursting a special move (that drains MP), to finish it off. Secondly, your 'TP' meter, which raises the more you get hit or deal damage. This allows you to perform some deadly special moves. Last thing that shoud be noted here is that unlike most RPG's, Lisa REALLY encourages exploration rather than grinding for you to level up which I think is a really good approach.  Lisa's soundtrack really is... something else. I can't go too in-depth on it, without saying it's really undescribeable, yet still really awesome and very worth checking out.  Of course there are a couple negative points that should be addressed. Being able to save and load constantly can sometimes draw away from 'The Painful' feeling of the game. If the game forced you to save after sleeping overnight, or making a crucial sacrifice, this definitely would have lived up to it's name a little more. I'm aware the 'pain' difficulty allows you to only save once at every save point, but it doesn't change the fact you can still load to prevent some of these. Sometimes text boxes can't even fit the whole text, it's not a huge deal, but it's really strange when I see a bit of text cut off.  I'm aware I've left out few important details such as 'joy', and who exactly 'Lisa' is. But I can't recommend this enough to anyone whose a fan of 'comedic' RPG's. Be wary though, Lisa make's damn well sure to poke fun at you for some decisions and not hold back on making you feel like ♥♥♥♥ all while being really unsettling. It's important to note, Lisa eventually got a DLC sequel titled 'Lisa The Joyful'. While it lacks the charm of 'The Painful', it's still very worth buying in the complete package. Any RPG fan who wants to see an interesting approach on the genre should definitely pick this up, especially while the complete package is still on sale.",

I quickly picked up this game towards the ending moments of the Steam Winter Sale and tossed this game into my cart along with my other games. I instantly stopped playing all the other games I bought and focused all of my time into this one RPG game. The gameplay in LISA is difficult and will require you to try over and over again before you manage to defeat your foe, but the people you end up battling can range from disgusting monsters to more personal story characters that you will end up just caring. Every action you do in this game will and shall have an overall effect which can easily come back around to haunt you father down this difficult game. Mixed in with the toughness is a intersting story that you will end up following and becoming attached to. This game will kick you in the gut and make you feel the same misery as the character that you play as which I had never experienced in any RPG ever before. You will feel pity for your saddened character towards the end of the game and will end up either doing a rerun to have different effects take place or end up buying their DLC. I reccomend this game to those who are looking for a emotional and seemingly tough RPG that will end up pulling your strings. I give Lisa 10/10 Rando's Rations",

            "review_text": "LISA is a terrible game. LISA, The Painful RPG, goes to many places many RPGs don't dare to go, for better or for worse. LISA can and most likely will punch your face in, only to step on your heart while you are down and make you laugh about it.  Because of that, it's probably one of the best games I've played in quite a while. Warning, TL;DR up ahead.  LISA, The Painful RPG, is an RPGMaker game set in the land of Olathe, Somewhere, USA. You take the pivotal role of Brad Armstrong, a balding drug addict hooked on Booze and Joy to take away the pain of a horrendous family life and god knows how many other regrets. Your sole goal is to find who is possible the last woman on the planet, a girl named Buddy who you helped raised from a baby. On your way, you'll face the worst humanity has to offer, and a few more other monstrosities along the way.  The actual RPG mechanics of the game, for an RPGMaker game, are solid, if not a bit unbalanced. Most of the stats are what they say on the tin, but some of the status ailments, if you forget what they do, offer no hints to what they actually accomplish. The combination of Fire and Oil is also hilariously OP, but in a world as fatal as LISA, is it that OP if it helps you keep people alive? Who could beat some of the more powerful bosses without Birdie around to spit oil and RT or Mad Dog to roast the competition? The combat itself is fairly gratifying, but out of all of the things LISA does, it might be the one thing it doesn't do perfectly. Almost as if there is stuff missing, like rock and paper missing scissors.  What isn't missing, however, is the on point music and sound design. The game can be fairly loud at times, but it is all in the grand scheme with the quirky and appropriate musical compositions W2D put together. It's honestly, in my opinion, one of the things LISA doesn't get enough credit for. The music sets a wonderful tone that follows your story superbly well, and even better when the music is yanked away. There is nothing more eerie than completing your goal, and being greated by a haunting tone of nothing but your footsteps. This design really does accentuate the real positive of LISA; the brilliant story.  LISA's story is a story that I can't help but appreciate. The main character, Bard Armstrong, proves to be such a character deserving of such empathy, but as the story goes along, both he and you are tested in how much you can take. People will die. Sometimes it's the people that you care the most about. Death, doubt, and betrayal are all around you, biting at your heels the moment you think you are in the clear, and there is never a moment where you are safe from the cruelty of post apocolyptic Olathe. The joking, dirty crust of LISA only lures you into the rotten, depressing core that will make you question what you do, and make you ponder the answers of questions you hope to never want to answer in the real world. It'll make you regret. It'll make you doubt. It'll make you hurt.  Even if you are squeamish, or not into RPGs, or any other excuse you could think of, reasonable or otherwise, I  implore  you to take the risk and try LISA. It's a nasty, perverted, and disturbing game, but it is one of the best, if not  THE  best RPG I've ever played. When LISA The Joyful comes out, buy that too. ♥♥♥♥, play LISA the First too. Absorb all the LISA you can get. Embrace it. Taste it. Digest it all. You won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "I'm gonna go ahead and just quickly address all the mentions (for good or for ill intentions) of Undertale here with an 'Honestly? Stop that'. Comparing the two games unfair to either, as both have their own unique identity. We get it, you really hate or really love Undertale. Now shut your facehole and let people enjoy other things without dragging your stink into it. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.   Anyway...   This game does a LOT of things right, which makes it one of my absolute favorites. In terms of gameplay it manages to stick things as familiar as turn-based combat and moral choice system while still managing to keep things fresh. Things like the combo system for characters like the protagonist and a few recruitable party members, along with the chance of an enemy having an ability to permanently kill any of aforementioned crew, keep your attention without the 'spam the A button to make everyone attack until thing dies' that many RPGs today suffer from. It's simple, but it's also unique.  And on the topic of the moral choice system, can I just point out that anybody writing a post-apocalyptic setting should take some notes from this game's writing? Because LISA does a damn good job of blurring the lines of morality, as a world where everything has gone to ♥♥♥♥ and everyone's just doing what they can to survive should. Personalities will warp, chances for even a fleeting moment of relief or happiness will be taken, but there still can be even the smallest speck of good in there.  Where LISA really shines through though are it's story and characters. The mood is portrayed really well with a wondeful mix of soundtrack, storytelling, and visuals. Little bits where the game doesn't take itself too seriously are sprinkled about the story, but it's still able to remind you just how bleak the situation is. It's also one of the few games where you don't HAVE to play the prequel, LISA: The First, to enjoy the story. But at the same time doing so will explain a lot of things about the trilogy's namesake character.   Speaking of the prequel, another thing I really adore is how this series touches on sensetive subjects without using them just for shock value. It also doesn't portray said abuse victims as beautifully broken people who can do no wrong because of what they've endured. You can sympathize with the trilogy's three protagonists, yes, but their actions in one game or across many will still make you question the kind of person they really are. As a survivor of abuse myself, the personalities of Brad, Lisa, and Buddy all speak out to me very much. And speaking of people...  The party members and the NPCs! How could I write a review for this game without mentioning these colorful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? I've only seen a handful of games that offer a variety of recruitable folks to join you that still make them all unique! The game manages to not draw out their time to the point where some would nitpick about it, but still manage to give them some pretty powerful personalities! The NPCs, albeit important to the story or not, are also solid proof about what I said about blurring the lines of morality. Across the trilogy, reoccuring characters aren't written off as inherently good or evil, but as burdened by their various pasts and coping with it in different ways. A character you could hate in one game could redeem themselves in the next, or a character you loved in one game could do something unforgivable in another.  I've heard a few complaints about the world of Olathe, in that it's very linear. And honestly, I'd have to agree. But at the same time it's vast enough for you to discover all sorts of hidden secrets or just fun easter eggs. Linear doesn't necessarily equate to bad, but the variety always helps.  Another I've heard is the ever popular 'it's too hard!'. To which I have to respond: Dude, it's known by its fans as 'LISA: The Painful RPG' and even has a harder difficulty called Pain Mode. If you walked into this game not expecting it to try and kick your ♥♥♥, Then I'll probably assume you're also one of those people who expected Dark Souls to not be hard and not really know what to say to you.   All in all: this game is a masterpiece and well worth the 15 dollars for both the game itself and it's sequel-DLC, LISA: The Joyful. And on top of that? LISA: The First is entirely free. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good story with some challenging gameplay!",

The story itself is much darker than what you might originally think, dealing with hard choices like sacrificing part of yourself in order to save another team member, or choosing him to die just to keep yourself out of harm's way.  A thing to be noted is that the game can be quite challenging at times. More often than not there are limited resources in areas, so you cannot grind your characters up, and as such funds to buy items are in scarce supply.

This is one hell of a depressing game, and at the same time one hell of a good one. My definition of good is always gauged with the question, 'did it make me feel anything'? If the answer is yes, then generally that game is pretty bad ♥♥♥. It has and will always be my favorite aspect of gaming, but I digress.   Lisa made me feel, a lot in fact. I sit here, a week out from playing it still thinking about it, and how in some ways I'm like that disgusting person, surrounded by those terrifying people, trying to find redemption for great regrets.   It's deep, it's terrifying, it's beautiful, it's atmospheric, it's witty, it's unrelenting loss, and it's freakin' hard. If you've forgotten how to RPG, you’ll either figure it out here or you won’t get through the game.  You'll likely die a lot, and you may lose things at a moment’s notice, significant things.  This game isn't one of those 'pretty good for an rpg maker' games, it's a must play as game period.  The artstyle in general is an Earthbound meets acid kind of feel.  Outside of combat looks and plays like Super Mario Bros 2. Stupid cliffs...  Inside combat is like Earthbound, with flashes of character animations which are really well done.   The music might be one of the most impressive things, not only was it completely unique, but it set the atmosphere better than most AAA games that I've played. Kudos.  c in an incredibly heavy story.  The only real gripes I had with the game was a lack of tutorial (I didn't know you could use truck keys until I was 3/4 into the game, so I had to do a lot of back-tracking), the controls are stuck in an awkward way, and some people might think the battles are a little drawn out, but I think it adds to the challenge and tension.  I recommend this game 100% if you are in the right state of mind.  10/10 Would lose everything again.  ",

            "review_text": "So, before I begin, I would like to thank Dingaling for providing a fresh and fun entry into the indie genre, one that has affected me and many others greatly, and hopefully will endure the test of time.  I feel that the first thing I should do is address the drawing of parallels between Undertale and LISA. These games may share quite a bit, but it is absolutely NOT worth comparing the two, as they share completely different themes and gameplay focuses. Undertale's focus is more on gathering friendships and the value of those friendships. Undertale likes to be fair(so long as you are going pacifist), and will reward you for playing along. LISA is a take on how everything can be taken away from us in the blink of an eye, even if you DO play along. Choices you make will be difficult, they will have an effect on you in the moment, and will make your journey significantly more difficult, as you cannot avoid these decisions.  It's unfair.   Life is unfair.   I will now break down LISA into pros/cons like the good little reviewer I was born to be.  Pros: -Great soundtrack, I still listen to a few of the songs on my own time, and each area has it's own little (widdly2)diddly as you walk about and absorb the atmosphere.  -Incredible atmosphere, LISA is hopeless, you will feel hopeless, but that's part of the enjoyment, the comedy given to you in the form of characters and wacky situations help raise your spirits to give you the motivation to continue on regardless.  -Story(?), LISA easily has one of the most dark and inhuman storylines of any game I've ever had the pleasure of playing, it will destroy your sense of being and bring you back to the light only to send you back to hell. It makes you feel things. It's good.  -Combat(?), Although many would say combat was the shortcoming of LISA, I actually found it a bit fun, it works on a basic WASD dial combo system to dial in skills for extra damage. If you were too lazy to learn the combos yourself, you could simply circumvent the dial combos and go straight to the skill menu. This feature was a blessing and a curse, the latter I will explain later.  -Art, The art was nothing special to be honest, but it was definitely really good and the earthy tones really helped convey the tone Dingaling was going for.   Now, onto our cons.  -Difficulty Curve, LISA's main selling point may just be it's downfall. It's hard. This game was incredibly hard in it's beginning stages, albeit it becomes easier as the game goes on, it almost turned me off and has actually turned off many other players from continuing the game. Anyone who buys this needs to understand that you'll need to push past that first crossroads before the game picks up and you can actually fight things.  -Combat(?), LISA's combat is a real crapshoot, you either like it or hate it, or who knows, you might be fine with it, but it definitely wasn't anything revolutionary and ESPECIALLY in the beginning stages it's tedious as hell and can really get frustrating to fight anything. It gets better later on, but as I said, the steep curve of this game turns players off right from the beginning without showing them a light at the end of the tunnel  -Story(?), LISA's story is ♥♥♥♥ed up, and for the most people, hardly relateable. It's really dark and depending on your life experiences you will either become enthralled in it's world or be completely turned off by it's harshness. Really a matter of preference.  -♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ING CLIFFS, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T  Overall, I rate LISA:The Painful RPG a 8/10, could have been better on the mechanics side of thing, but overall an amazing title and a great addition to anyone's library.

The combat may be sort of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vanilla RPG Maker battle system that some here may at first find stale, but the gameplay actually becomes rather entertaining with the sheer amount of Party Members and the teams you can build with them. Just exploring the odd world and soaking in the craziness, and the odd 2-D platforming. Some teams are obviously better than others and some might be even a bit OP, but it's always tempting to put on a talking Fish with legs on your team over your OG Terry. The punishing aspect of the game is in full force as well. Don't choose Pain Mode for a first run unless you are some sort of masocist like me. Even then don't do it because one of the best bosses in the game loses all his dialogue and character so I'm thinking of replaying simply to experience that again.   The story is also well crafted and told. The actual plot may seem to be rather conventional. It's like The Last of Us mixed with Children of Men + Fist of the North star and crazy wrestling references. But almost all the characters speak, act, and feel like real people. Real flawed, selfish, awful, but ultimately sympathizable people (except a certain 2). And the ending is absolutely perfect.  If I played this game back in 2014 it surely would be my GOTY.

I like playing games that force you to take moral decisions, but while in other games all you often get is a finger wag and the game telling you you're a bad person, LISA actually makes you feel the consequences of your decisions throughout the whole game.  The story of Brad, the protagonist in LISA, is the saddest story I've ever played, read or seen. Never have I felt so much pity for a fictional character. The developer, Dingaling as he calls himself, proved that he is very talented when it comes to story writing and I am already eagerly awaiting his next project. The same goes for the OST, the music is among the best I've heard in a game, it fits the situations you find yourself in perfectly.

While the two games have some major key differences, the choices you make during your journey do affect your game and yourself as a person. Will you be selfish and risk the life of your party member in roulette just to earn magazines (the game's currency)? Will you sacrifice your party member's life in order to keep your own arm? Will you give in to the drug called Joy, which makes you feel absolutely nothing? Just how far will you go save the life of someone you consider your daughter? The choice is yours.   LISA has many unique characters, some of which you will hate (and in the end perhaps love) and some of which you will love right from the start. While the game does not go too in-depth with backstory, some of the flashbacks throughout your journey give you enough information to piece mostly everything together. And holy hell, is it depressing. There's a lot that I can't say since I don't want to ruin the story, but let me just say this game is an emotional train wreck. It makes you laugh, makes you angry, and it makes you cry.   Every aspect of LISA is what makes it such an amazing game. The crude humor, the complex characters, the soundtrack, the storyline - it's all amazing. LISA is definitely one of the best games I've ever played.",

Story is also very different, following a man named Brad, addicted to a drug called Joy, who chooses to raise a girl, when in the current present there is none, and as such every man is a pervert, who wants a piece of the action. One day Brad's friends are ambushed and the woman (there was a long flash forward), is kidnapped. Brad sets out to rescue her. The Humor is varied throughout the game, sometimes being very dark and sometimes being very silly. Music in the game is pleasant, charming, fun, like the characters often are.

Over the course of your mission you'll be joined by an off-beat group of wierdos who will help you in your mission or be total liabilities that you keep around because the only alternative is to let their annoyingly endearing selves be kidnapped or murdered. Combat in this game is very much in the vein of standard 90's RPG's wherein groups of dudes line up and take turns wearing each others faces like flesh-mittens, using martial or legal jargon to bewilder and curb-stomp each other into the grave. Some characters (like Brad, Rage Ironhead, etc.) have the ability to use the WASD keys to lock-in moves and get additional hits in before using more... Kenshiro-esque moves to dragon-supplex enemies into the nearest canyon/mass-grave. Overall, LISA is a personal experience where humour and loveable characters are forced to partake tramatizing, kafkaesque moral choices that ultimately amount to little more than finding the least painful (subjective) way of hurting yourself or those you love whilst trying to summon the will to continue on your quest knowing full well that it may amount to naught but a surprise nut-shot to the feels. Also, something worth noting, is that this game does have an erratic difficulty curve with some enemies being push-overs while others have death (that's permanent save re-loading death btw) moves that can clear your roster unless you play with the intention of save-scumming. However, LISA is an awesome experience and one that you should willingly submit yourself to.",

So, LISA (the painful rpg) is an Earthbound-inspired, Sidescrolling, FistoftheNorthStar-Reminiscent, DarkHumor-Filled experience. If that sounds somewhat interesting, this is the game for you. I use the term 'Experience' because thats what this game is, I felt different by the end of this piece of artistic mediums fusing together to make an enjoyable and depressing time.  You play as Brad Armstrong, an ex-martialartist teacher who was abused as a child. He lives in the post apocolyptic city of Olathe where women have somehow died off and gangs rule the world. Brad finds a female infant and decides to parent the child from the dangers of the perverted, maniac-filled land that is Olathe.  Speaking of Perverted Maniacs, Meet Olathe's inhabitance! You can meet/group up with a fishthemed superhero, a dude who takes a dump on a spider, a crossdressing badass pimp, a professional pornartist, a fish with legs, a drunk pink powerranger, the tutorial guy who starts out super weak and ends up becoming the most powerful teammember, and many more dumbasses to join you in your quest to protect your child from evil and just plain douchbaggery.  You know when you make a choice in a video game and it barely has any consequence? WELP NOT IN LISA, Some choices don't effect the entire game (more of you challenging you ), but others can plague your entire game session. Do you like this teammate? WELP NOW YOU HAVE TO EITHER GIVE UP EVERYTHING YOU WORKED FOR OR HAVE THAT TEAMMATE DIE. Other choices can have you lose certain attacks you grew attached to or hell, have your stats lower immensely. Your ingame sprites will change too if you decide to lose certain items.  EDIT: ok lets talk about the bad parts because i regret not talking about this great game's faults too. So writing wise, you get alot of teammates to join you and more than half of them are bland and forgettable. Look me in the eyes and tell me that you put Yazan or Ajeet in your team and don't lie. Some of the likable characters have like two minutes of dialouge, then you never get to see that charming personality ever again and its kinda sad because you they build up something so cool and it just stops. (if i think of anymore bad things about this beautiful game, ill edit this paragraph)  The ending of the game is the most satisfying ending I have ever expirenced (oh hey theres that word again) I feel like the DLC kind of robs the power of the ending and replaying this masterpiece (which i just did) cheapens the blow of the ending. The ending of this game is the best case scenario for a story like this- scratch that, its the best case scenario for the writing of this story so you can actually feel something in your (and my) stone cold heart.  As said before, I may reccomending the EVERLIVING ♥♥♥♥ out of this game but I don't reccomend the DLC. The DLC is a sequel that starts right off of the ending of the previous game. It fixes every hole that the game set up (even the holes that were best for interpretation) and bullies one character to death. The DLC also is abnormaly harder and more aggrivating. It doesn't crack a single joke (the writing is still pretty good but eh, I think Lisa the Painful is better when it stands alone.)  Please buy this game and expirence it, most of my reviews are crappy jokes but this is serious.  buy it on sale, buy it at full price, buy it for more than its worth from the bootlegger in the back of that one alley you purposely avoid. Just pay for this game to feel the depressing and witty experience that is LISA THE PAINFUL RPG",

All of this and enough ambiguity to leave some things up to the player themselves and I'm always down for games that let you come up with your own interpretations of certain elements.  Don't get me wrong, this game would no question go on my personal top 10 list of rpgs (or dare I say any games in general) but the experience is what I would call an aquired taste and it really isn't the type of game I'd reccomend to everyone.

Reasons you might really like LISA: -The story is one of the best I've seen in recent years -The game in general take inspiration from Earthbound and actually pulls it off really effectively -Terry Hintz -Decisions in a game that actually drastically effect gameplay as opposed to feeling weightless to the overall experience -A fish lawyer on legs -The difficulty never goes into the 'Impossible' territory, It's always pretty much in the 'hard but fair' range. -30+ Party members for a lot of combination potential  Reasons you might NOT like LISA: -The game works off a high amount of dark humor, which works well for the setting but isnt really everyone's cup of tea -Laaaaaarge amounts of gore/body horror, again, not everyone's jam -Family abuse is a really heavy and prominant theme of the game -Mandatory Russian Roulette (with permadeath) -The ability to savescum might make some of the game's choices a little less impactful, but that's more of a personal play preference thing. -You'll cry -A lot -No I'm serious you're gonna cry I promise.",

This expertly crafted dark comedy is truly one of the strangest and uniquely excellent games around. The story and its themes are a unique and interesting look into the life of a broken man on his path of personal redemption. Perfectly paced and masterfully executed. Playing off of what we are already meant to expect from this genre. Similar to the way Earthbound approached the RPG. Very dark personal themes like addiction, child abuse, depression and insanity are often at play but still manage to retain its weird scene of quirky humor. Combat is well thought out and satisfying, giving you a ton of party members to recruit along the way. I recommend 'Pain Mode' if you think you have the stones. The game has a surprisingly large number of 90 excellent tracks that add a whole other level of moody depth and character to a already rich experience. This game has brought me allot of Joy and I hope you give it a try. Its a prime example of what a good game should be.",

Not to mention that Brad is addicted to joy, a very addictive drug that will cause you problems in your journey through the game (Withdrawal). But anyways, the game fast forwards to Brad as a young adult who then finds a baby (Buddy) who ends up to be a girl. If you don't know, LISA is in a post-apocalyptic state and there are only men left in society so this means that Buddy is the only women left in existence. Instead of revealing Buddy to Rando and his army, Brad decides to hide her along with his three childhood friends Rick, Cheeks, and Sticky. The years past by and Buddy is now a older child but not yet a teenager, but then Brad fast forwards to him being drunk and high in the middle of nowhere. It then transitions to Brad helping out your first recruitable character, Terry Hintz, Terry is a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character until the ends and he achieves a high level so i recommend keeping him around. But anyways, Terry Hintz joins your party and you proceed back home to discover Cheeks outside gushing with blood and he tells you that Buddy was taken and she is gone. You then can walk inside and pick up a weapon and then you can go outside and proceed to left to climb down a rope to start the story. You then come across many enemies and three crossroads, and the whole journey is based off your decision-making and how you take the fights to your enemies. There are many recruitable characters to accquire across your journey, i prefer to have Terry, RT, and Olan but those are just my personal preferances. But anyways your entire journey is to find Buddy and i suggest you prepare for your final fight against Rando, he is the boss of the Rando Army and is your final boss of the game. I suggest you wear him down to when his mask breaks because the mask reduces fire damage, because of this I recommend you use to Charging Headbutt to stun Rando and then when his mask breaks you should use the Diesel Firebombs. Once you have defeated Rando the game is practically over, you just have a scene when Brad talks to Buddy and you can pick your ending. Anyways, you will not be dissappointed after purchasing this game, i suggest you buy the bundle with LISA: The Joyful and The Original Soundtrack &amp; Artwork. I haven't gotten the two DLCs but I am looking to accquire them soon and I'm sure LISA: The Joyful will be just as good as LISA. I hope you have as great of an experience with this game as I have, have fun and good luck!",

The music is out of this world (it'll be the first thing you notice to be Earthbound inspired), the art is simple yet bizarrely beautiful, and the dialogue is hilarious. There's so many subtle ques throughout the game that adds depth to the story. The game pulls no lame cliche plot-twists, and does so much to push the envelope. I've never been faced with harder decisions to make in a game. Those decisions don't need to change the game, because those decisions change YOU (and yet, it does both). You should play this game. It will make a difference in your life. You know a game is good when it makes you laugh all the way to the end, and then makes you cry, and that's what Lisa did for me.

            "review_text": "Before anything else if you aren't up to feeling depressed don't play this game. I can assure you those who love it would say the same. This game was designed to be a downer.  I feel bad talking bad about a game I got as a gift but I feel like it must be said. With all the praise the game gets I feel I must be the Devil's Advocate. Also it may say I've only spent an hour and half. But I played when my internet cut out for a while. I'd say there should be about 5 more hours on that time. This is probably mostly just opinion but bear with me.  Overall I personally don't recommend LISA. Even as a fan of the Mother series and it's successors The charm doesn't seem to be there. I see much of it as flawed. Execution fallen flat. Many may like it but I feel people shouldn't play simply because of all the hype. IMO Be wary.  The gameplay is my biggest gripe. It doesn't feel new. Yes it's just like Earthbound but still there isn't as much polish. Shoving a metric butt ton of party characters does not an interesting rpg make. Obviously you're just gonna pick the best ones and leave the others sitting around like imperfectly bred pokes in the pc. There isn't much strategy to picking who to use it's more of who can do the most damage and/or heal the most. A good RPG gives you a handful of characters and tells you to make due.  I know why they gave so many characters and it's because it has to compensate for the 'pain' Which is just another way of saying how many ways you can be screwed over by RNGeesus. Perma death is a thing and it can happen on a whim. Not like Fire Emblem/XCom/Valkyria Chronicles where you made a fatal error. It's because that's just how the dice rolled. The enemy did an insta-kill move you didn't dodge or resist and that's that. It isn't common and you may not have had it happen to you but it's there. If there's anything I know is that for me that one percent of failure is a very real threat with my luck. But simply put It's more like getting annihilated by critical hits in a Nuzlocke run.  Then there's Joy addiction. Oh boy what fun it is to sit through a withdrawal. Every 300 frames/5 minutes that you don't transition between areas the game flips a coin. This determines if any of your Joy addled party members go into total noodle arm mode. Pretty much reducing any physical attacks they do into someone throwing cotton balls. You don't get over it through time though. It's either by resting (a risk depending on where you sleep) or going through 20-30 turns in battle. It takes a mildy interesting idea of dealing with addiction through gameplay and turns it into a major inconvenience. Especially since you can work around it with special attacks. I've had withdrawals from medication and I can tell you it sucks. But the way the game handles it doesn't drive it home. If it had actual symptoms of withdrawal like wooziness (occasionally miss) weakness (halved damage) or nausea (sp drain) as simple examples then I'd be ok with it. However as it is, this is less like heroine addiction and more like having a ♥♥♥♥ drunk friend that you have to take care of. Yes I know the world is supposed to be 'unfair' and that it was done this way to hammer that fact in but It's just lazy. I could go on for millenia about this but in short it's just fake difficulty.  Another aspect about having so many party members is the choice to save one's life. The game storepage seems somewhat proud of that. I personally haven't done chosen against it because I am a goodie two shoes but at the same time I think that it would just be easier to plan accordingly so I can send off a weakling. Because I've looked into it and there are no ill effects whatsoever. Most of the characters have little personality beyond their character design so one wouldn't feel torn about losing someone. This isn't like Mass Effect where a choice between Ashley or Kaiden must be made (although I've never liked either character) But these are people you can learn to care for. Sacrifice is hollow here.  The story is definitely slow. I do appreciate that it fills itself in through bits and pieces but the more it does it seems too simple and shallow. It is rather cliched imo. Especially in Brad. He's got the best intentions but is much like his father. Classic apple and tree scenario. The abusive father thing is also there. What annoys me is that the father seems to just be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ just to fill the role. Right in the beginning it felt like he just had to hurt him. His reasoning barely held up. Having read up on the backstory his actions simply don't make sense. There major are lulls in the story as well where basically it's just dealing with whatever shows up. And whenever anything does happen it just feels like it's trying to be total grimdark. I assume the pacing is meant to keep the player from burning out however instead I started to dread the possibility of the next story event. Another problem is that some of the character interactions frustrate me. Although that's probably my personal gripe with a lot of tragedy stories shining through. In tragedies character flaws will always explode even in the most level headed man for no apparent reason other than to produce a negative outcome. I tend to sit on the cold logical side so it's always a pain to me. Oh well not everything can be Hamlet.   In regards to the humor it's kinda hit or miss for me. I started to just turn off later on because I simply stopped caring for the jokes so I couldn't even give them a fair shake. I just wanted to get through the dialogue. Don't get me wrong I love dark humor, I have the entirety of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac (which I would recommend for fans of this game.) sitting on my bookcase but this stuff just couldn't jibe with me. Maybe it was too predictable maybe it was just that the tone didn't quite match. I just can't put my finger on it.  If there's something good I could say it's that the music can be pretty kickass at times.  Put simply I say meh to this even in all my negativity. Pessimism HOOO!~ Although it's a meh that means that I'll probably never pick it back up to finish.",

            "review_text": "LISA the Overrated  I might be learning disabled because I can't seem to derive meaning from a lifelong pattern of being disappointed by games that were overwhelmingly praised for their story. On the other hand, it occurs to me that it's this vocal majority that suffers from a learning disability because they don't understand what 'story' means. The story is the sequence of actions and events that propels a narrative forward. Of the 5 hours I played, only the first 10 minutes contained any story. The other 4 hours and 50 minutes was a loop of 'grind for EXP -&gt; boss -&gt; darn, ya just missed your daughter'.  Often, people mistakenly say 'story' when they mean 'characters' or 'atmosphere'. Even so, the characters of LISA are absurd caricatures slapped onto disposable damage sponges. They're not charming, deep or endearing. They're just there to even the odds against your enemies. As for atmosphere...there are the makings of it sprinkled throughout the game...but the disparate elements never converge into a cohesive or coherent whole. You can see the vision the creator had, but the game, unfortunately, fails to manifest it completely. Everything ends up feeling like a cheap parody instead of a genuine post-apocalypse.  Of course, the failing of the story (or perhaps its pacing) might be overlooked if the aforementioned 4 hours and 50 minutes were spent enjoyably. And if I was the sort of man who enjoyed mental/emotional grinds, I suppose they would've been. But I'm not...and they weren't. I will proceed to catalog in detail why that time was not fun:  The combat is pointlessly shallow, rivaling rock-paper-scissors at the height of its strategic apex. If your party isn't composed of the worst characters and you're not dangerously under-leveled, combat consists of pressing Enter until it's over.  The oft touted 'dramatic/meaningful choices' chalk up to mild inconveniences for the most part. My personal favorites: 'Lose a party member or sacrifice easily obtained items from your inventory' and 'A party member has been kidnapped so now you must backtrack for 5 minutes to retrieve him without so much as a confrontation with the guilty party'.  The equally oft touted 'dark humor' is...there...in some disjointed fashion. There are dark bits that are clearly trying to be funny but aren't. And then there are ridiculous one liners at the end of battles that will either tickle your taint or not. Some of those one liners were surprisingly good.  The music consists of 2 tracks that are pleasant, catchy and original and 3 or 4 additional tracks that are generic and grating. The rest is just ambient noise. However, I can see why the 2 enjoyable tracks would have people raving about the soundtrack. It's a classic case of surpassing a void of expectation. And that about sums up this game and its overwhelmingly positive rating.  The idea of LISA and its Mad Max-ian, deranged-mutant-freakshow-of-a-world is a delightfully refreshing and singular take on the seemingly-beaten-to-death setting of civil collapse. But executing that idea as a parody with generic JRPG mechanics in GameMaker (of all things) was, I think, a mistake. One that lead to disappointment, dissatisfaction, and dullness in the wake of expected refreshment.",

            "review_text": "LISA is a post-apocalyptic turn-based RPG with an 8-bit grindhouse aesthetic. Like any grindhouse movie, the violence, swearing, and uncomfortable sexual overtones that the game forces on you are gratuitous and handled without an ounce of nuance or subtlety.   Lets get the gameplay out of the way first. Bog-standard RPG combat with a pointless combo system that is incredibly tedious to play once you understand how it works (never explained, btw). Find the best combo and spam it. Go back and forth between big, empty levels where you do little more than climb up and down platforms for seemingly no reason than to extend the playtime of the game.   Completely lifeless level design through and through. After the 'shock' of seeing mutilated bodies and blood splatters wears off (clock that at about 3 seconds) you'll find that you're just pressing on from screen to screen without really taking in any scenery...because there isn't any. It's just big brown screens with platforms and ropes, forever.  LISA prides itself on being challenging and forcing you to make hard choices with its 'make a sacrifice or lose a party member' mechanic and the fact that resting in many spots will often incur a large penalty onto your party. These are the only cool things about the game, and I will give points for these interesting mechanics! That said, any 'difficulty' in a turn-based RPG is always nullified by grinding, which LISA encourages you to do, relentlessly, with a propensity to throw you into an inescapable combat at a moment's notice - hope you're levelled up enough, or saved recently.  Back to the elephant in the room, though - the art direction/tone of the game. I'm sure there are people out there who play games like this and go, '♥♥♥♥ yeah! Finally, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s make a real game that isn't afraid to show you some ♥♥♥♥ed-up ♥♥♥♥ like a guy's head getting bashed in with a baseball bat and jokes about ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a little girl!' LISA caters explicitly to this demographic, and naturally comes with the token pretense of intellectualism. You know, the 'ooh, this is humanity when society breaks down, man' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that makes people think they're experiencing something other than pure, animalistic carnage for the sake of carnage.  It's not that I'm even against that, in the right hands. You know who did this better? Hotline Miami. The aesthetic, the mood, the Heart of Darkness horror, all of it done loads better, in a game that was actually fun to play. If you want to drill into an NES sprite's skull, you can do that in both games - but Hotline Miami is a game first, and a snuff film second.  This is not a good game, and I'm devoting more words to it than it deserves. Don't buy it, don't play it.",

I get that this is indeed the entire point, but I'm of the opinion sacrificing sensible game design for a message makes your game unfun ♥♥♥♥ and worse still, pretentious.

LISA is different from what I'm used to see here on Steam. I bought it during sale, because the trailer remembered me of Earthbound/Mother 3. But that's only the style and combat of the game, beneath is a whole different gem. The story. It is, what makes the game outstanding. It has its highs and lows, and even those lows are positive. It makes you feel unsecure and disturbed. The flashy Gameboy Advance-like graphics even enhance the effect, maybe I'm just too much used to blood and gore in video games. (Or it's just dark like in Dead Space. It's so dark, you don't see all the blood).   Introduction to the story:  You are Brad, about 45yrs old, bald, drug-addicted, Karate-Master, suffering from your past and sharing your home with your best friends. One day, you find a baby laying on the ground, which is a bit of a wonder, since women don't exist anymore in the years after the  white flash . Even more of a wonder, it's a girl. Now, what would you do? Give her away? Tell everybody? Throw her on the ground? Take her with you?  Everybody knows what will most likely happen to the only woman left in the world.  So you throw her on the ground.  Well you do. Not on purpose though. You decide to keep and hide her, name her 'Buddy', raise her... But still, there is your drug-addiction. And your past. And your friends. And then you come home, just to find everybody dead and Buddy gone.  From here on it gets interesting. Wheres Buddy? What happened? Lisa? Joy! People. They know you. Who are they? Hallucinations. Joy! Decisions, that affect you and your friends. A crazy world full of men. And lots of Joy! You know, the only hope for mankind is your daugther. You know, your daugther is going to get ♥♥♥♥♥ by tens, hundreds, thousands... Depression. So much joy! It turns people into monsters! Joy is a hell of a drug!   Pros:  + Great story with an interesting setting. If you can get into it you will love and hate it. You will even love and hate the ending + Earthbound/Mother-like style and combat + Decisions about yourself and your gang. You WILL need to sacrifice something + Great details + Much room for imagination + Dark humor + Randomness + You can have up to 30 guys in your gang. Everyone is different + Pixel-gore + Most enemies are unique, except for a few snakes and Marty's + Soundtrack fits perfectly, although it's simple + Eastereggs like Power Rangers, Mario &amp; Luigi, and more + The sequel is coming. + Free prequel, called  LISA the First . Haven't played it yet, but I'm about to.   Cons:  - The beginning of the game seems a bit slow - Early game looks mostly brown. Later areas of the game get more diverse - Your gangmembers don't add that much to the story outside of combat (no talking to them), with a few small exceptions. Like, really small exceptions. (They are kinda like Pokémon, you collect them, they fight for you. So its not too bad) - Middle ages had a better menu (might be the controller config tho) - You need to like the Earthbound-style combat    You should get it.  ",

If you're a Mother fan, you'll see definitely catch the similarities.   Overall, I really enjoyed the game. The graphics were simple yet expressive, and the sprite work was fantastic. The soundtrack really set the mood too as well, and it helped immensely with immersion. The combat was pretty fun as it reminded me of Xenogears, one of my favorite RPGs. The story draws you in quickly and from then on it's a crazy rollercoaster of laughs, frustration, feels, and tears. The game attaches you to Brad, the protagonist, in such a way that it really makes you feel for him later on. However, as much as I enjoyed this game, there are some flaws.  I'm not a fan of the Joy gameplay element. Having to potentially manage a whole party of joy addicts is a pain in the ♥♥♥. More should've been done with the addiciton mechanic, like being able to become clean or at least increasing the amount of joy there is in the game to compensate. Perhaps include more of Buzzo's goons as merchants? It just seems like the devs didn't really think that through. Nothing is worse than trying to do a joyless playthrough and battles take forever because Brad and frends do 0 damage.   My next con is that for a game with tons of party members it seems rather difficult to grind the others up to speed if you lose some and need new ones. It sucks to lose your best party members and have to use much weaker ones when you're at a point in the game where they'll get owned quickly.   A map would've also been useful. I eventually memorized the areas but some of the ones in the beginning are very samey. This gets better in Areas 2 and 3 though.   Despite the game's flaws, this is a fantastic game and is a must-play if you like oldschool RPGs and good stories. This one will rip your heart out and ♥♥♥♥ on it.",

You want to play this game until 3 in the morning, but you end up staying awake even longer thinking about what you just saw.  The game is difficult. It requires a lot of old skool strategy to get past the encounters, and you shouldn't expect a lot of situations where you can get repeat battles for XP farming. (They exist, but you have to find them.) Even resting in the wrong areas has a chance of hurting your party. Keep multiple save points, as there are plenty of 'points of no return' you may want to re-explore.  Widdly 2 Diddly's soundtrack is bizarre and goofy, but really enjoyable and fits the game extremely well. There is a lot of music in this game, too. So much so that there isn't really a universal battle theme for each encounter. It's varied enough that you'll never get bored, and you'll have something awesome to listen to as you fight a big boss.

About the gameplay, for someone who doesn't like RPG's that much like me, the battles were really entertaining mainly because of how weird or unexpected your enemies are (or your party members), and It felt that it was at a fair point of difficulty. I died probably a lot of times, but usually not more than 1 time in the same battle so it didn't feel frustrating.

The game is fairly short and can typically be beaten within 9-10 hours, but there is a decent amount of content to keep you busy with the game for a while. While I did enjoy the story and a ton of the characters in the game, I did feel the story was a bit off and didn't really go over some of the more important questions a player might have while playing.

It evokes emotions that other games have yet to create.  Everything from the music to the writting to the story is incredible. I loved every second of this game. It was long and extremely interesting to play. This is a classic example that you don't need the best graphics and greatest technology to create a game of the year. Also, don't let the sidescroller aspect turn you away. If you arent sure if you will enjoy this game... just buy it and play it. It will be the only decision that wont be regretted.   *I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart*  10/10",

Lisa itslef shares similarities to these in limitedly in its puzzles but majorly in its battle systems.

This isn't bad, however, since it allows for exploration and non-linear progression. There are entire areas you can miss out on if you don't take your time to explore. Even though I hate turn-based combat, every battle in this game was engaging and pretty fun. Each party member has unique abilities they can use in a fight. It's also extremely difficult, as certain enemies can instakill your party, and once someone in LISA dies, they're gone for good. There's few safe places in LISA, every time you rest you risk the chance of having your party members poisoned, kidnapped, or straight up ditch you.  The game is amazingly well-written. It can throw disgust, shock, and jokes at you all in a 10 minute sequence. You really feel everything Brad goes through. While Brad's quest is one long depressing journey, there's an array of weird and funny characters and sequences that balance it out. Choices actually matter and even affect the gameplay as well as the story. You're forced into many situations where there's no obvious right or wrong choice, and no matter what you do you'll probably end up feeling bad.   I can't recommend this game enough if you like playing games for the story experience. It rivals, and is probably even better than Undertale in every aspect that made that game great.

We all make our own tough choices in life, same way in this game. But, in order to make progress you need to make choices to prove yourself to be a good person...or a bad person.",

            "review_text": "The tagline of this game couldn't be more accurate. LISA: The Painful RPG isn't afraid to delve into territories most consumers will likely be turned off by: childhood sexual abuse, drug addiction, lots of violence. The journey of the main character, Brad, is a downward spiral into a world of pessimistic nihilism, where the motto 'Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong' is an inescapable reality.   The story:   We're introduced to Brad Armstrong at a very young age; us waiting very little time before witnessing his abusive relationship with his father; the neglectful state of the home he lives in; and, of course, his little sister, Lisa.   Cut to many years later, soon after an unexplained event that killed off the female population -- the world has been driven into a sort of Fallout/Borderlands/Mad Max state of chaos, where societies have broken down into roaming, violent gangs. This is the last age of humanity, as there is no way to reproduce, and very little hope for the world remains.  That is, until, Brad -- now aged and addicted to a drug called 'joy' -- stumbles upon a baby in the middle of nowhere... A baby girl.   And without knowing how she got there, or why, he takes it upon himself to raise her as his own, vowing to keep her identity a secret from the world, for fear that if she was ever discovered, she would be subjected to the same abuse he and his little sister were subjected to as children.   However, despite his careful attempts to conceal her gender, she is one day discovered and kidnapped. And so Brad vows to undergo a dangerous journey to save her from a fate worse than death.   ...  LISA is not a happy game, despite the plentiful amount of Borderlands/Fallout-style post-apocalyptic humor thrown in. It is a game not only about sacrificing parts of Brad's body, but also his humanity; what little remains that makes him a good person -- all for a small, slim hope.   I have to say, the last thirty or so minutes of the game were so gutwrenching and expertly handled, I had to stop and just think for like ten minutes after the credits began to roll. Seriously, it was masterful.   Gameplay:  LISA plays very much like a side-scrolling Earthbound, with unlockable attacks, different party members and first-person-style turned-based combat. It's pretty fun, and provides a pretty decent challenge -- although sometimes the difficulty can spike when you least expect it, providing sort of an uneven curve. Not a huge deal though.  The primary complaints I have are with the interface, especially when trying to use the shops. For some reason, whenever I am looking at weapons I potentially want to buy, I am unable to compare them to anyone else but my immediate party. Which means I have to leave the shop, run over to a gang sign, switch my party out, and then go back to the shop. It's strange because this isn't an issue when I'm buying from an armor shop. In addition, many pieces of equipment will affect multiple stats (like agility, luck, etc), but, when comparing your equipment in the shops, I am only able to see the attack comparison for weapons, and the defense comparison for armor. So there are times when I have spent a ton of mags on an 'upgrade' when the item is actually a downgrade, simply because I was unable to see all of the stat changes prior to my purchase. I guess it's possible that I'm an idiot and am doing something horribly wrong, but, after almost 30 hours of playing, I'm decently confident that I've tried everything.  Overall, despite some of those aforementioned, minor complaints, LISA is a fantastic and criminally underrated game.   Oh, and the music is freaking awesome, too.   So go play it!    Final Verdict:  A solid 9/10.",

First off the sound track is beautifully crafted with variation of Mongolian folk song and violins to blaring airhorns and that was just one song. Secondly I have never played a game with this good of a story, there are a lot of games that try to make a deep story and fail miserably making a confusing and very complicated story that just was not good and this was not one of those games. I have never seen a story so well thought out that kept you on your toes scared of what is going to happen to your child buddy. THis game is disgusting it will make you feel very uncomfortble at many many times it will repel you and draw you in at the very same time. the gameplay, I will be honest in saying that this game did not have the best gameplay, turn based RPG's are not the most fun type of game Bullet Hell games are this is a fact. Anyway this game did well in making every battle different and unique unlike some games (Tomb Raider Underworld(And that game wasnt even an RPG and Lisa did better on gameplay)) Dingaling was able to give his characters depth and he was able to reward the people who were able to memorize the combos which if you hook up a dualshock 4 controller and make the WASD the back triggers instead it is really fun smashing those and seeing the damage pile up on your enemy. This game did really good on making me get attached to characters I cried a few times... Aaaaaaaanywaaaaythis game after i finished left me wanting more and then I found out about LIsa: The Joyful. That was the best DLC ever it wrapped up just about every question for the game.  I would definitely recomend this game if anyone were to ask me about it It has the best story of any game I have ever played there are a few technical gliches but they are easy to ignore with all of the other great aspects of the game and after you are finished get lisa the joyful your world will be changed forever Tem/Tem   Praise Wally and buy this game for gods sake what are you waiting for?",

The combat system consists of pretty played-out JRPG-style battles, but there are so many weird mini games and cool subsystems that give meaning to the battles that you won't mind too much, especially since the battles are paced out well enough that you never feel swamped with them.

One big thing I loved about this game was it's art style, which looks very similar to the Mother games a lot. Another, is the music. The music may be quite simplistic at times but it just sounds so frikin' good and matches with the game (my faves are: 'Summer Love', 'Boy Oh Boy' and 'The Highway King'). Anyway, the most important aspect of the game is its plot and the paaaaaain. You play as a balding overweight middle-aged bearded man named 'Brad' who can do karate trying to search for his adopted daughter in a sorta Mad-Max feeling apocalypse. Brad had an abusive father and his sister comitted suicide, (you would know this if you've seen or played the first 'Lisa' game) so he had a pretty tough life. But it seems to be that this world he now lives in may even be worse as it's all pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up. ♥♥♥♥ed up as in there's the male prostitution since there are no more women around, underground fish people, the bloody Salvation Rangers omg, and of course: the ♥♥♥♥ing creepy ♥♥♥ mutated humans. This game should be known for it's tough decision making and ♥♥♥-holey ♥♥♥♥ like your team members leaving you or getting kidnapped, being poisoned by spiders, etc. That's why it's called 'The Painful Rpg.' It's also because of the way they ended the game, god rest its soul.  Basically, this game is very weird but awesome and I like it because of that. The only downside to this game is probably the battle system, and that one glitch I discovered. Other than that, it is one of the best games I've played and should be acknowledged as well as Undertale is since they are both good indie games that have been inspired by Earthbound. It is actually really hard to explain my experience with the game but I reckon anyone who has played the game may know how I feel about it. It was a JOY to play this game...",

LISA: The Painful is a great game about sacrifice, and does a pretty good joke showing how that sacrifice is perceived from both sides. It starts off with a fairly dark premise, of child abuse, selfish redemption, the end of the world, and some guy willingly letting their child put makeup on them. Initially the darkness is well balanced out by the game's humor, which is simply superb.  People say Undertale was Earthbound inspired, but this game BREATHES Earthbound far more than Undertale could ever hope. From the art style, to the combat system, to quite a bit of the humor, this is a game that Earthbound fans would appreciate. Only a game like this could have an utterly soul crushing moment of character development, and then have a joke where a blind bandit attempts to ambush you and utterly misses.   The Sacrifice system is pretty interesting as well, and most of the characters do a decent job of making those moments when the choices happen all the more impactful.  It's a game that does a perfect job of balancing humor, and throwing your soul into a juicy meat grinder. One that's put on the slowest setting. And then they switch it off near the end to let you suffer.  It has some flaws, but most of them are pretty much obscured by the positives, sans maybe one or two.  9/10. Buy it if you really want to laugh, feel bad, laugh again, and then feel horrible about that laughing.   Oh, and that DLC? LISA: The Joyful?  It's hard to describe it without spoilering anything, so I won't. It perfectly continues the story however. But uh, except a harder soul crushing by the end. The game just switchs that grinder to an even more agonizingly slow setting.",
