I am personally a sword enthusiast and collector, I have always been interested in swords and sword fighting, and whenever I am in a sword-y mood, this game really solves everything. The Steam workshop is already full of awesome custom-made swords, as well, and they're easy to just download and use.. takes about 2 seconds. You will sometimes have issues with lag, but as long as you keep an eye on Server ping when you choose a server, you will be just fine :) The community is fantastic and very passionate, however rather small. Hopefully more people will join ;) *hint hint*  If you do buy this game, feel free to add me; I'll gladly do my best to help you get started! See you on the battlegrounds, -Zypre",

Sadly, after awhile I got burnt out and figured I would wait for some more characters, and for better usage of masks and capes. I just came back to it, and all I saw was empty servers. No new characters besides the single new one that was present at my time of leaving. I will continue to play this game with friends, and whenever I find others on the game, but it seems this beautiful beast of a game has grown tired. It's life force nearly drained, with a max of 10 players online at any given point. I will hope this game regains its community. I hope this game becomes as famous with age as Super smash bros.Melee did. But on that note, if its fanbase does come back, the creators of this beautiful beast need to care for the players more, with more playable characters, and more sword types.",

            "review_text": "Okay, boss, real talk time!  Its an exceptional game, with exceptional effort put into exceptional gameplay, with an underwhelmingly and almost saddeningly small community that is (despite what too many people say) somewhat xenophobic, however its not hard to blend well even if you're new/bad.  Obvious outstanding Pros: +Awesome sord-fitan +Cool, somewhat unique character roster, each having their own moveset +Community content can be enabled in settings, allowing you to see someone elses workshop weapon! (Honestly best!) +Legitimately skillful (supposing you dont have higher than 60 ms ping) gameplay revolving around your reaction times, planning, strategy, and ability to think on your fingers. +Custom servers with unique content enabled change the design of the game, lowgrav makes aircombos (with some ground stances) available midair, creating more intricate and unique ways of play, though lowgrav is dead now. +Character combos are honestly as depthy as it can get, and unless you're fighting a one trick pony, you will need to adapt and switch into different tactics to win the fight, I garuntee it, boss!  The sad cons, that we should all understand are NOT REALLY THE DEVELOPER'S FAULT  -It sometimes feels like you might be the one and only person who plays this game. -If you are easily stressed/find yourself mad a lot, this game will make you angry. You will lose a lot, it is to be expected. -Weapon types are somewhat lacking, and should change more than just damage values, interval rates, and such. I always feel as though the katana is useless, scimitar is hyper situational, Jian is for pure, and only longsword/rapier work out in the end for stable gameplay. If you're like me and you fashion souls, you wont worry, and will just have a beautiful tool swinging at those nasty little runts! -Perhaps a hidden ranking system, or the ability to not show your rank on some servers. Its jarring when you're oak/iron, and all you see is masters, because you dont want to lose, its a possible reason why our community is so small. -Community is TINY. Even on our recent peaks, we will only see around 100 people at most on servers, whereas mostly its 20-10, its that bad. However, whoever is there is strangely always someone different. -Any lag whatsoever kills the fidelity of the game, on either end. No matter which side is lagging, you're going to lose, because for some reason, this game cannot handle even the minutest change in ping, you will notice that your parries are useless, your gaurd always broken, your back always being stabbed, ranged always hitting, lights parrying balanced, and worst of all, they will almost always disappear when you swing. Its bad, its so bad, but its source, and thats source's horrid issue, best you can do is hope to lead where they're going and always use light/air to keep quick.  Some nitpicky issues now. -Characters are all asian, its the game's design style, but its just edgy and silly, boss. -(Weapon) feels weak unless used on (character), every type, every character.  -Weapons should be better diversified, and the ability to possibly use a customized, point based weapon type with the only change being a skin might actually seem better than the current system. For example...  --- Lets say, you just want to make a sword thats good for comboing. You have around 100 points to spam into various attributes, those attributes could be divided into some divisions like  Base damage Side damage Air damage Combo interval Combo speed Can guard/(whatever rapier's gaurd is)/Feint/no gaurd (for increased points or easier charge) Charge speed/damage mods  While veterans of the community are K with what we have, this change would bring more uniquity to the gameplay as less cut and paste styles would be present. We're looking at you, JianPure/ScimitarPhalanx.  Imagine if you could make a multihit wrecking sword for disorienting and winning through attrition, or a TRUE CHAOS FLAME +5 ZWEIHANDER FOR MAXIMUM BASE CANNON! Or a faster swinging but weaker hitting wep to make Ryoku actually viable and not countered by moving left slightly. ... Or we could just have less cut and paste weapon types.  It might even be a rad idea, to do something like this with characters, mixing and matching combo patterns to weave your own intricate web of butt-touchingly awesome combos that will make everyone on the server mad! --- Overall, its a great game, boss! But it has its flaws, and they can get a little jarring if you're not very prepared to face them. I think if more people played it, more love would be seen all around, while I would prefer to see the game change drastically, most people don't and are comfortable with what we have, but I feel that appropriate changes would see a more unique crowd enter to join in on our fun.  Its a 9/10 game with a 11/10 community, funny goodhearted people, though few as they be.  Now get the heck out of my inn, boss!",

            "review_text": "Pros (+4): + Truly amazing Soundtrack, the music is really great. Theme song is the best. + Hardcore old-school gameplay style, Jedi Knight fans would love this. + Visuals are beautiful and astonishing. Source engine isn't very demanding. + Great character and fighting style diversity.  Cons (-4): - Gets old very fast without much content to offer. - Extremely difficult to learn for beginners. - Repetitive gameplay and game modes. - Small playerbase, servers are empty most of the time.   VERDICT :  I would recommend picking it up during a sale along with the soundtrack, but it's well worth the 10$ price-tag. If you're an old-school Star Wars Jedi Knight fan, you must play this. Otherwise, it's your call. Since there's no neutral vote on Steam, I'll just give it a thumbs up!",

            "review_text": "Weapons duelers like Chivalry and Soul Calibur are based around using different types of weapons with different skillsets like hammers, nunchucks, and zweihanders. Blade Symphony takes this concept and narrows it down to just swords, and by doing this, they have a created a skill-based duel game that is fun to watch and play.   Story wise, Blade Symphony isn't much to look at. Here's the gist of it: You're a blind swordsman trying to become the best in the world. Seriously, that's it. However that's not where Blade Symphony shines. It's graphics are very well done, especially at the particles when swords collide. All of the models, both sword and duelist, are very well done with textures fitting the weapons, like giving the katana 'Serrated Serenade' a serrated edge. When wandering around the maps in free for all mode, it's a joy to be able to climb up onto a roof and take in the scenery. While playing I didn't notice any texture pop ins or jagged edges.  While Blade Symphony may be lacking a story, it more than makes up for it with its deep customization and sword play. Upon entering, you're guided through a series of tutorials teaching you about basic things like sword types, all the way up to advanced side cancelling, with Puny Human planning on releasing more as time passes. You'll pick from one of four classes, with Judgement being your defensive tank, Ryoku being the nimble fiighter, Phalanx your long reach sniper, and Pure with her fancy spins and sword flurries. Along with your sword type, either katana, longsword, rapier, scimitar, or jian, and sets of fast, balanced, and heavy stances, you have an unlimited amount of strategies waiting to be learned. You'll see common ones like Judgement with a longsword to deal massive damage, or Phalanx with a rapier to deal bursts of damage, you can visualize more unique ones. A slow and bulky Judgement wielding the jian, which speeds up your move recovery, can help him compensate for his slow heavy attacks. Fighting tooth and nail with another play is electryfing, and the main reason why this game is so much fun to watch. When not slashing other players into bite-sized chunks, you'll be either waiting for the way too long load screens to disappear, or using your currency to purchase new swords and masks. While they certainly change how your character looks, they don't do anything to impede the balance of the game, since everything is cosmetic. This makes the game purely reliant on skill. The only way to get good at the game is to practice, practice, practice.   THE VERDICT:  Stuff I liked: +Simple yet deep swordplay +Vast customization +Skill based gameplay +Electryfing duels  Stuff I didn't like: -Horrendous loading times  9.5/10 Outstanding  With how easy it is to get into Blade Symphony and how deep the strategies go, it's easy to lose several hours into one play session. If you want a multiplayer duel with a large amount of depth and customization that takes a minute to learn and a lifetime to master, stop reading this review and add Blade Symphony to your cart.",

The graphics are well done, and the sword control and movement control are also very tight. Beyond that, however, it instantly begins to feel like an imitation of soul caliber without the deep combo system.   Fights in this game currently amount to a matter of which character has a further reach on their opening attacks along with quite a bit of what you see in other games of this type (people using the most broken attacks repeatedly to win).   If you enjoy games like Soul Caliber or Dead or Alive you will probably like this game.",

            "review_text": "I haven't played this game for as much as I'd like to thus far, but it's pretty clear already how impressive it is.  Going through all of the tutorials gave me a grasp on the fighting system works. I understand the basics, but still can not reliably win in a duel for the life of me. This is and of itself isn't a bad thing. In fact, part of me is excited for how much more I have to learn. Unfortunately, another part of me is upset by the fact that there's no easy or convenient way to do so.  This game does not hold your hand. It very much tosses you into the deep end and lets you sink or swim of your own accord. If you've ever played 'Toribash', you'll probably understand what I'm talking about; you've got an incredibly complex fighting system that you can start with a friend to be on-par with (though only because neither of you are any good yet), or you can play against bots or foes online that understands the ins and outs of the system and as such, at least for a reasonable while, tend to beat you without contest.  The game makes a point of saying that it will include further tutorials at a later point, which would certainly be welcome because as it stands one has to figure out most of the mechanics by themselves after seeing somebody else do it. YouTube for now remains the best place for in-depth tutorials to be best of my knowledge. In any case, this is definitely a game that will take a long time to master. If you're genuinely willing to spend many, many hours playing and perfecting this game, then good for you, I recommend it. I fear for many, though, it could end up sitting in their library as ‘that one game I really should really get better at some time’.  Character customisation is decent – you can chose one of four characters and one of a lot of swords, both affecting gameplay stats, and you can also make a few aesthetic changes. Unfortunately the character and sword you fancy most for the looks mightn't necessarily be the best for actual competition, but I find changing up your style to match a new, cool sword you unlock is refreshing. The modding community is certainly not lacking - there are plenty of custom items and maps to download, if that's your bag.  I tentatively recommend this. I think you can already tell whether or not you'd be wasting your money.",

There are, however, some issues, for one, offline play There is an AI to practice against but it is incredibly bad, you have to set up what the AI will do, you can for example set it to attack or defend, it cannot do both, making it effectively useless. Also the player community is fairly small, which is sad, I have played ten hours so far and I have already run into some people I recognize repeatedly, but overall I love Blade Symphony's combat mechanics, and that's what sells it for me.",

FFA lets you walk around free and allows you to challenge people to duel everywhere, or have a big free for all fight. i like that you don't purchase power (swords of the same sword type don't have advantages over eachother), and that the different sword types all play different, allowing you to experiment with wich playstyle you like most. the 4 characters are very different, for example phalanx is like a fencer while judgement is more like a samurai or knight. however, the game is a little unbalanced. one character (who a lot of people sadly play as) is a bit overpowered. and since most people choose faster characters, the heavy character seems a little underpowered sometimes. but over all, puny human did a good job. i give this game a 7/10.",

But as long as the game keeps up with updates and patches, it would be on the right track to becoming a worthey addition to the fighter genre. You dont even have to wait for the developers to really make anything in ways of customization It Has steam workshop suppot which is great and already has some cool stuff in there.

            "review_text": "I have been eyeing this game for a while and was fortunate to get it in a bundle.   If you like swordplay, dueling, and heavily-skill based gameplay, then you will enjoy this game.  The aesthetics are fantastic with very detailed models, skins, and weapons. There is strong mod support for user-based content, adding a large variety to the customization potential. The music is very good at keeping you engaged in the extremely intense combat.  Although you will be primarily using the mouse, the controls can be very tricky to master without lots of practice, and the learning curve is moderate to high - depending on whether you are used to aggressive, all-out-offense gameplay (you will find this game very difficult if that is your preferred playstyle). The tutorial is very helpful and critical to understanding the mechanics of the game - playing practice fights with the AI can help you get a grasp of how each character + weapon works. The combos are not complex since you are just moving and using the mouse, but things like timing, switching stances mid combo, parrying, and dodging are important to balance and master.  The feedback for where and how your sword will strike is provided by a faint aura showing the weapon path. Manipulate where you will strike by using the mouse and also by moving around. You can do air attacks by jumping first.   There are different types of weapons, like katanas, longswords, and scimitars. Each weapon has different characteristics - for example: the katana is a fairly advanced weapon, inflicting heavy damage during counterattacks, but weaker in overall regular attacks. The longsword is pretty balanced and has a good blocking move.   You have three different stances, fast, balanced, and heavy - you can switch at will by rolling the mouse wheel. Using these stances, there is a rock-paper-scissors element that becomes integral to survival in this game. When two swords hit at the same time, a parry happens; however, different stances will override the parry, inflicting damage and creating a window for counterattacking. You can switch stances in the middle of your combos, and this makes the game very intense when you are trying to strategize and outmaneuver your opponent.   You can also cancel attacks to feint, and the tutorial does a good job of teaching you how to do this.   In the beginning, when you are first learning to play, be prepared to die. A lot. If you play roguelike games or Demon/Dark Souls, you should be well accustomed to dying - it will be the same here. Even when you are defeating the AI consistently and with excessive ease, you will still die when you play online. Just remember, its all part of the learning process.  I noticed that the connection time can get pretty lengthy, so that is something to consider - there is also no average wait timer, so you can't know for sure how long it will take to find/enter a match. There is also a lot of complaints about the card drop rate - if this is something you care about, I have found this game to have the most ridiculous drop rates. I still have 3 drops left, and others have reported only 1 drop in 8 hours. This isn't too big of a deal if you intend to play this regularly, but definitely be aware.  This game definitely takes a significant amount of skill, and I advise you to stay away if you intend to play casually or do not like games that are too difficult. Otherwise, give it a try, and you may find the challenge to be to your taste.  Recommend.",

Blade Symphony has something I've never seen before in it's genre of game. It's hard to pinpoint what it is that makes this game so enjoyable. Maybe it's the online servers with hundreds of people to meet, duel and make friends with. Maybe it's how well it works and co-operates with it's players. Maybe it's just the whole game!  In closing, I think Blade Symphony is a fantastic and cutting edge game in it's genre that is focused towards the players enjoyment of the game. I really recommend you pick it up and try this game out, I sincerly think you'll like it.",

In Blade Symphony you customize one of 4 characters, and go into battle in a handful of game modes, including duel, free for all, and capture the point. The swordplay is pretty easy to learn in my experience, but that does not mean it does not take skill. So its easy to learn but hard to master I guess. Blade Symphony has Workshop support, so this help alleviate some of the need for more content, even so it is still pretty slim on modes, maps and what not. Overall I have got to say if you are looking for a small, multiplayer, swordplay/ action game, Blade Symphony is worth looking into.  EDIT; I should note I have no idea how the community is when its not a free weekend, I have heard whispers that the game has an extremely low population.",

            "review_text": "'My opponent was jumping straight at me, and just when I thought I had him countered, he rewises his trajectory in mid-air, then landing sword first on my poor face. After the match, when I asked him what it was, he answered mystically, 'It's called air canceling'. That got me wondering, so it wasn't cheating or lag, but a trick within the game's rules... After a few minutes in the training room, I realized I could pull off the same move with some practice, though using it in a match... Well, that was another story...' Then I realized something bigger, this game was much like swordfighting or martial arts in itself... The only way to reach the next level is to learn with your (avatar's) body, feeling it all through combat.  But just how do you recommend a game that's a cross between fighting games and third person action? Well, there's just nothing quite like this anywhere. The combat is a mix of 'FPS-twitchiness' and hack-and-slash, combined with hp bars, rounds and move dynamics of your average fighting game.   While weapons differ to a lesser degree, the 4 classes all have a distinct feel to them. But just comparing the diversity of the classes and moves doesn't do this thing right--- There's just so many ways to do battle, spam fast attacks and find yourself countered by a heavier attack (or not if you spaced yourself right). Thought you had it all calculated and fall into an attack cancel, taking a heavy blow to yer face. While the tutorial and basic mechanics feel very barebones, there's just so much to find out on your own, this game would last ages for anyone with even a little competitive spirit.  To top it all off, there's free workshop content for customising your look in any manner you like, crazy anime weaponry, cardboard tubes, ski poles and of course videogame swords. Most of the community is also very helpful and there is a samurai-like code of honour when it comes to dueling. The only downside is that the majority of the remaining population has been playing for months now, meaning that any newbies like yours truly will have their bottoms handsomely handed to themselves.",

And that's probably all people need. But there's absolutely no single player experience at all and the last time I played, lag was somewhat of an issue still. I also didn't notice too much different between the current version and the version I played when it was still in early development other than the AI opponents were added (and I'm assuming that a lot of glitches were fixed, but tell me what else I’m missing). The AI opponents are laughable since they won't really help you get better being that you can beat them by doing the noob strategy I mentioned earlier.

You're also able to cancel animations which all the veterans take advantage of in order to beat their opponent and doing so will give the new players a fun time fo being stun locked and not being able to swing their weapon at all. Now the community of this game seemed cool with the addition of the workshop to get cool new weapons but thats the only good part about it. the community so far is a bunch of cocky 12 year olds that refuse to get off the game calling you bad for not being able to lay a hit on them with the bad hit detection and the animation canceling. This game is not worth $15, not even for the price of $10 like it was during the sale. This game should be free to play but even then the game will still not be worth the hard drive space.

The game does not force players to face each other and fight like traditional fighting games do. Instead it gives you free range of movement around the environment like a FPS game. And because it controls like a FPS and not a fighting game I have to spend more time trying to keep my opponent in my feild of view than I do actually fighting him. It makes me dizzy and frustrated. I am a fan of fighting games, and third-person perspective action games, but I think this game would only really appeal to fans of competitive FPS games. I really wish there was a demo of this game available, or at least a more in-depth description of how it's played. I was looking forward to this game, and I really wanted to like it, but it's not a game that will appeal to fans of traditional 2D or 3D fighting games, and ultimately I feel disappointed.  I'm sure this game will appeal to many people, unfortunately I am not one of them.  What else can I say about this game.... The graphics and animations are fairly good, but the ability to customize and individualize your character are very limited. You can use an xbox 360 gamepad to play the game, but you'll be at a disadvantage to the keyboard/mouse players.  EDIT - In conclusion: call it what you want, but it's NOT a fighting game. It's a bunch of people running around in circles hoping to slash an opponent as they go by. The actual gameplay looks very little like the videos on the store page, and it does not resemble a real fight in any way. Its not tactical sword fighting, it's a frenzied arcade hack-n-slash with frustratingly wild camera movements to go along with odd hit-detection and unintuitive controls. The four playable characters are as lame as they are limited, and the different skins available do not do much to help individualize your character. The servers are filled with identical characters running around in circles like flies hovering around a turd.",

Let's just say that Lego the Hobbit had better customization options than Blade Symphony does. And Lego the Hobbit had rather limited customization.  Ultimately, the game is just past it's peak. The devs take a while to respond to any problems raised by the players (as I'm sure many other reviews have already stated. Nevertheless, I shall give my two cents), and there's not much that is more frustrating to a gamer than unresponsive devs.  It's a good concept, and I liked how it was in Early Access, but the game is kinda dying now.

If that's the only way you define fighting game, then go ahead and call it one.  BUT  Blade Symphony is lacking in the depth present in a game like Skullgirls or Street Fighter. It's less about knowing what your opponent will try and more about exploiting the game itself to gain an advantage.  The third person over-the-should view obfusicates much of your ability to gauge the actual range of your own attacks, as well as those of your opponent. Hit detection is often quite spotty. Which results in awkward advances followed by swinging wildly while backing up. Hit and run tactics are the way this game is played for the most part.  Blade Symphony lacks the consistency of fighting games too. Frame rates aren't consistent, so good luck trying to gracefully and skillfully link sword attacks into one another. What you'll really end up doing is clicking and wildly swinging your camera around to manipulate your attack's path and speed.  It doesn't have the careful balance of fighting games, either. The project's leader, Flux, set out to initially balance the attacks each character possesses using a very simple method. He played against the 'knight' character, who for the purpose of this process used only his slowest, strongest attack. Clicking over and over, using only this attack, Flux then played each character and gave them tools to counter or get around this attack.  Then he was done balancing. The characters were done being iterated on, for the most part.  The dev team tweaks the numbers, at this point - sword swing speeds, damage values etc, but the ongoing balance meetings really only involve Flux asking the 'top players' (read: most popular/vocal at the top of the leaderboard) what should be done. And of course, you can imagine the clamoring for the weakening of characters that they have trouble with, and the buffing of their mains. To be fair, it's not really the player's fault - it's natural and unavoidable to be biased in your own favor, no matter how impartial you think you are. The blame lies with the devs for outsourcing it's finer balance decisions to the most highly competetive players.  Several characters have attacks that are so fast, they actually exceed the game's ability to display and often detect. Which can have wildly inconsistent results.  This game plays more like a third person action game, or an extremely bare-bones character action game. That's multiplayer only. Very little realism to be had, with characters defying physics with certain attacks, outlandish Errol Flynn techniques, and in some cases outright flying.  If you can look past some very bizzare balancing philosophies (ie none at all) and don't expect to play more than one character (ie the one everyone at the top of the leaderboard plays) then you might enjoy this as a unique competetive experience. But all I can see is a whole lot of potential wasted by poor decisionmaking and direction.",

If you've ever played Warframe then this game has the same idea; only with just PvP. The first thing I noticed was just how the whole layout of the game was going to be. Upon completing the tutorial I instantly knew that I would be facing players just simply spamming attacks. The blocking system isn't a smart one. You just simply go into a block stance and hope you block. So basically there's no skill involved. Even I just went in and mostly spammed my attacks because there's no real smart system.  The second thing I noticed was the projectile system. In order to block them you need to face them. Otherwise it'll home in on you and take about a quarter of your health. I don't much mind the damage so much as the fact that it acts as a heat seeker and you don't always block when you should (I mean come on they throw them at half a mile an hour). Running up walls is a chore to do as well since you have to run a little and jump and repeat (not asking for super running but a little more distance with it would be nice). The constant team changing also threw me off. One minute I'm fighting a person and the next minute I'm fighting with him. I like to stick to the team I'm given in a match.  The graphics, sound and music are all nicely done and the moves flow fluidly. The only thing I was irritated about was the fact that heavy attacks seemed too quick to be heavy and the hitboxes already seemed a little off. I realize I'm throwing a lot of negativity about this game. I know it's an indie game and that it isn't going to be perfect...but there's a lot of annoying elements that I unfortunately can't get past. I personally don't recommend it.",

The others will have you rolling and cartwheeling around, attacking to the sides and stuff. Now factor in that these attacks are modified by directional movement, and every character has different attack patterns for three different stances. How the hell is the player supposed to get this under control? Hit detection feels really strange on top of that, and the game gives you very little feedback to indicate what's happening.   As a result, fights feel like a bunch of spamming that has your characters flying all over the place, and you just hope that you're going to connect with something before the other person does. Not a very satisfying combat system, and the combat system is the entire game.  I'm sure it could get interesting between people who have spent hundreds of hours memorizing the attack patterns of various character/weapon combinations, to have some chance of matching them effectively, but I'm definitely not the type who cares to do that.  I understand that it's early access, and I'll give it a chance when closer to a finished product. Sadly, I'm not expecting much. They need to deeply rework the basic functioning of their combat system to be playable, in my opinion.",

The learning curve on the game is very steep, and the people left online have clearly been playing the living daylights out of the game. Most matches I was lucky to get a single hit in. I want to like it so much, so perhaps I'll spend a little more time with it to see if I discover some other facet of it, but I can't picture the game having any real staying power.  Edit: I tried spending some time fighting bots to get a better handle on the game. They are more difficult than the only three other players that were online. In three matches I was able to hit the AI once.",
