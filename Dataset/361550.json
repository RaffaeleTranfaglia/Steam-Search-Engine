            "review_text": "The world in this game is immersive, atmospheric, and uncanny. Exploring it was pure pleasure! If that sounds appealing to you, then I think you'll find that this game is worth buying. At the very least, you won't regret supporting the developers (I certainly don't regret it!), and it's not too expensive either!  That said, I honestly did not like this game. Leaving aside the beautiful environment to explore, this game is one-half mystery novel and one-half interactive puzzle. Therefore, the storyline and dialogue factor heavily into the overall experience. Unfortunately, however, the developers' greatest achievements are to be found in the areas of graphic and level design... *not* the narrative aspects of the game.  I immmediately noticed how bad the voice acting was from the very beginning of the game, and I couldn't get over it! It stuck out like a sore thumb for the full duration of the game. Honestly, the developers probably would have had better results if they'd just hired the first people they could find at a random bus stop! I mean, *come on!*  But perhaps even worse, the writing was so cringe-inducing! Have you ever heard a teenager say something that he or she *thinks* is profound but, in reality, just sounds naive and idealistic? The storyline and dialogue struck that chord with me over and over again throughout this game. It vaguely reminded me of a bad anime series, somehow. And the ending... man, I think that ending gave me diarrhea.  In summary, the writing and voice acting in this game are terrible, and while I can't recommend this game, I do think the atmosphere alone will satisfy some players. As always, please consider compensating these developers for the work they do. Video game developers *do* produce value, and they rarely charge players enough, in my opinion.",

The game was short even with me wandering aimlessly for a bit.  The story was very compelling all the way until just before the very end. The ending sequence is stupid.  The setting was enjoyable.  The mini games were annoying and didn't feel like puzzles. It just felt like a time waster to extend the game play-time.

Mostly every item can be grabbed and interacted with...except the axe. Early on you will come across an axe that you can't pick up. It just sits there and taunts you to lift it, but the game won't let you.   Cradle also has the really hot female cyborg NPC. You can take her apart and interact with her. Really amazing stuff.   In the end however, this game wasn't for me. I'm just not into adventure games as much anymore as I was 20 years ago. The game is still worth a buy if you do like this genre of game however.",

It was quite abstract and not entirely clear on all the meanings and implications in the end movie. Yet, the general idea was good and it was fairly engaging and interesting as a story. It's not easy to make a game of this caliber but writing a negative review is all too easy nowadays. I think the reviews are a bit too critical. If you're about utopic/dystopic games and a strange new future, chances are, you'll like this game. If you're not really into that, you may not. It's not your typical exploration journey, and it's definitely no mindless hack-n-slash or shooter. That said, sometimes we're just looking for something really unique and new and interesting and this one really fit the bill for me. It's an odd one, and that's exactly why I bought it. And, for the price, it's def not a bad deal. It's priced just right, if not under-priced, so a thumbs up is in order. It's not like it's not polished and play tested. I found 0 bugs first time through, and frankly, only one of the cube games was 'too challenging' the rest were easy. That's standard now. Someone said they were hard. haha, no. Only if you have no patience at all whatsoever. Plus, it gives you at least logical reasons to play old-school style ingame mini-games. And, with the option to skip them and wimp out, you should have no complaints! The only other thing I might like to have seen would have been a reason to explore ingame, todays games truly are competitive in that they do offer lots to find and look for. This one does not really deliver on that end, but that, for me, is the ONLY real negative. Otherwise, it looks good, plays well and retained both interest and fun game play. That's a good game. Might not be 'Epic' but wait 'till Cradle 2 comes out. ;-)",

Also, the mini games were fun but had little to do with the story. I will elaborate.  The graphics were done very nicely and kept my attention. The setting was interesting as well; futuristic. The story was good too. I'm trying to keep away from spoilers.   The story was not long. I believe even in the game it lasted less than a full day. It just seemed to leave it incomplete. It built up the characters and then the story just ends.  In the game you need to complete these mini games in order to obtain items. The game does not explain why the items are in these mini games, just that you have to complete them in order to obtain them.  I also found that no matter what graphics setting I had there would always be some lag when looking around quickly. My desktop has pretty high specs (3 gb video card, 32gb of ram, 1 tb hdd, i7 processor). Not sure why that was. Possible it was a problem specific to my machine.  I just feel like this game was released prematurely. It did not leave off well like a game where you might suspect a sequel. It left much unexplained and incomplete. The game would be even better had the mini games had something to do with the items you are trying to obtain.",

I can't even think of ways to describe it. There's a lot of hidden backstory, which is typical for an exploration game. However, there tries to be a story at the forefront with a lot of setup, and not the greatest payoff.   That being said, by the time I had finished the game, I was full of conflicting emotions that makes me want more, while at the same time knowing that it doesn't need a sequel.  Environments are beautiful, music is outstanding, and the puzzles are just challenging enough that you'll have to try a couple of times on your first play-through, without being too frustrating.  Highly recommend to anyone that are fans of puzzle, exploration, story-heavy, and/or sci-fi.",

            "review_text": "You are alone in a yurt in the middle of the Mongolian steppe with no companion other than a broken android chick with a flower vase for a lower body. Cradle sure is an intriguing elevator pitch! It’s a shame the actual experience is short and yet somehow still feels padded and just doesn’t sustain this initial sense of mystery.  But let’s talk about the yurt first. It has one of the greatest sense of place I’ve seen in a videogame. It’s rickety thing worthy of the Middle Ages, but it holds a contemporary TV/DVD player, an early 20th century kitchen and futuristic doodads including the aforementioned android. It’s also credible as a lived in place: filled with family photos and documents to read, a Buddhist shrine, children’s toys, etc. It’s worth it tearing the place top to bottom to see what mysteries it has to reveal and it has quite a few.  Stepping out of the yurt for the first time is equally impressive. Hills lazily stretch over the horizon. A lone line of elevated hover train pylons leaves to the imagination the outside world it could connect to. The enormousness and remoteness of the steppe are well represented, but there is almost nothing to interact with out there, as can be expected. The only other place to explore is a derelict amusement park. The puzzles in Cradle should be mostly familiar to anyone who has played first person point-and-click adventure games. The park, however, adds a virtual reality Minecraft cube-digging minigame, as improbable and inopportune as that may sound. The game even tries to find a good reason why there would be block puzzles in the middle of the steppe. The explanation is about twice as implausible as the story reason why Quiet has to run around half naked in Metal Gear Solid V.  The story itself is just weird. I’ve wondered what kind of conversation some dude in the steppe would have with a robot chick. It turns out the answer is “a lot of dry exposition”. Cradle’s approach to sci-fi is to assault the player with a shotgun blast of gobbledygook. I won’t spoil it here, but I find it’s a lot of concepts crammed in a 4-5 hour game, culminating in a abrupt and quite odd ending. Some of it is compelling, but I have to admit it mostly didn’t do it for me.  I didn’t terribly like Cradle, but I admire it’s ramshackle originality. It’s something that it somehow seems only Eastern Europe can produce (Pathologic and Stalker come to mind). Unlike many indies custom-made to cater to hipster sensibilities, Cradle has a real sense of authorship. Considering this and the lack of grading options, I would give Cradle a thumbs up, although it is not raised very high.",

Cradle is riddled with a number of bugs that can make it nearly unplayable unless you happen to have the perfect set of circumstances for it.   Major Bug #1: You must plug an official Playstation or Xbox brand controller into your computer before starting up the game. Otherwise the frame rate drops to an jerky, unplayable mess. I am not the only one who has complained about this. I easily found comments on the forums complaining about this bug since the beginning of November and not a thing has been done to correct it.  Major Bug #2: If you have an official Playstation or Xbox brand controller plugged into your system when you try to play the game, you will find yourself locked into Crouch mode. You will find yourself staring at the undersides of tables and having to jump just to read the first note or interact with nearly anything. Again, the developers seem to be doing nothing to fix this problem besides saying that they are working on it.   So these two bugs combined to make my first few minutes of the game frustrating and absolutely intollerable for a game relying solely on environment immersement. Coupled that with the fact that the last patch to the game came in Early October, I had to return it. I do not expect the issues to be fixed any time soon and that truely saddens me. I wanted to like this game so much, but the bugs make it unplayable.",

            "review_text": "First a warning, then my reason for liking the game:  Warning: The game is short - about 6 hours on your first playthrough if you don't rush. While it advertizes itself as open world, and you can indeed walk around freely inside the world, the world has only 3-5 distinct locations which are all within short walking distance from each other. There is not much to explore in this game - but the locations that are there are very rich and detailed. The ending is sudden, but thought provoking. Chances are you'll about the story and the ending long after you've finished the game and you'll likely want to play a second time to better understand the story.  Why I liked it anyway: The setting is fresh and mysterious - you don't know what to expect and gradually descovering pieces of information about the world in this game is stimulating for your imagination. This coupled with the great soundtrack and decent voice acting makes for an immersive experience. Aside from the main puzzles, the game gives you many snippets of information about the game world, it's history and the protagonst - but for the most part this is entirely optional - the game doesn't go out of it's way to reveal it's story in an foolproof way - you'll have solve the puzzle on your own if you want to make sense of what you've experienced.  For me this game was a unique experience that I liked. I expected a bit more content, so the price might be a bit high for what you get, but I can't say I feel ripped off.

The concepts and characters are compelling and can be generally identified with fairly readily.  However, Cradle falls short. It is so good in certain ways but... It's like a beautiful woman who is wearing heels too tall for her. It looks beautiful, it seems like it might even have something interesting to say, and then it takes a misstep and falls on its face. The subgames, though explained halfway through, feel jarringly out of place until that point. Walking through the beautiful landscape generates a certain feeling that does not mesh well with the subgames, feeling like a hacking puzzle in an FPS, a contrived challenge that is just there to act as a weak barrier for you to mill through, separating chapters, making you backtrack, and not even being unique among themselves. I feel like the game could have easily been better without them. The story, though a bit confusing at times, is very well told for the most part. The little snippets of information provided by the readings and the conversations point to a fascinating world with fascinating possibilities and a future like you've never quite imagined. And then you go back into the subgame, completely disengaging you from the storyline and presenting you with hoops you don't even have to jump through. (I'll spoil this with no guilt. If you fail a subgame, you can just skip it and still get the achievement.) When you finish it and get back into the storyline, it gets even more interesting and tantalizing, a bit more of the story is revealed. And then it goes back to the subgame. Worst of all is the ending. It seems like it's really building to something. It seems like it's getting ready for the big reveal, answers for your questions. But it isn't. It's going to give you a halfhearted hand waved in the vague direction of the answers to your questions and then ENDS WITH A DAMNED MUSIC VIDEO. I'm not saying everything has to be handed to the player but there basically is no third act. It jumps clear past it to a climax without epilogue, like watching the first two LotR movies and then skipping to the big final battle from the third movie and ending once the battle is won with no more explanation. I will say this though. The soundtrack is beautiful. I am still torn as to whether it's worth buying but it's definitely beautiful. It was so good, except when it wasn't. It could have been so much better, but it wasn't. I'm not sorry I played it but no, I cannot recommend it.",

World - lovely setting, lovely colors, lovely graphics, lovely detail. 3. Tatra T3 - now a freakin' jet tram! Get your babushkas on it and send 'em straight to Mars. 4. Android lady - pretty damn nice android lady, nuff said.  Now the cons: 1. Main character's voice - well, main character is okay in general, since there's not much to his appearance or background, but that stupid mumbling emotionless voice just ruins whole thing. I mean, come on, even some stupid youtube letsplayers are acting better than that. 2. Length - well, that game is short and leaves quite a cliffhanger(not to mention an 'android-ladyhanger'). 3. Final custscene and credits - live video with fat-faced soviet lady and crappy pop on background. What else to add? I hate it.  So yeah, this game is fine, if you're looking for good non-conventional sci-fi setting and not afraid of amateur or low-budget execution, then give it a go.",

            "review_text": " Story/Gameplay  This game is set somewhere in Mongolia year 2076. You wake up in a hut, or Yurt, and have no memory of who you are or where you are.  The game doesn't hold your hand in the way of storytelling, you have to figure out the story all by yourself, if you have time you can find a ton of reading material in the hut about what has happened, but the main story comes from the android woman on your desk which you have to repair. The game does however hold your hand through all the tasks you are given and tells you exactly how to solve everything, though you can choose not to read these hints if you want to, so it's not so bad.  Back to the woman on your desk, the story progresses when you repair/replace a part in her and new information is revealed to you through her, because as she gains new components she remembers more things about her past. There is also another person/android which I think is an old friend, I'm not quite sure, but he reveals more information about the past in exchange for flowers (you will get it if you play it).  Now, the way you collect these new parts is quite dull, you have to play one minigame for each part, which doesn't sound bad at first until you get to the second minigame and realize it's the same one, just altered a tiny bit. The whole thing becomes tedious after a while and you find yourself trying to rush through it so you can unlock more storytelling and not play stupid minigames involving cubes. The story reveals why these minigames exists and why you get parts after completing them, and also why they are so dull, but this could easily have been changed so they all are completely different from each other and not all consisting of cubes and still fit it into the story. This is one of the two things I didn't like about the game.  The second thing is that it states that it is open world, which it is, but you only go between two places all the time, you even find a thing so you can travel between these places quicker, and they are only like 500m apart. Sure you can go explore but there is nothing to be found, it's just a big steppe or whatever it's called. I think there are some collectibles laying around but I didn't find a single one.  Where this game really shines is in its story, they have created a really good backstory and an explanation to almost everything, there is a certain   four digit code   I have not found the explanation to yet, hopefully it is buried somewhere in all the readable things laying around, and yes, everything is readable, every little scrap of paper laying on the floor to long news articles, and everything is relevant in one way or another. You really get the sense that this guy is living out here all by himself, making his own electricity, food, water and selling flowers to his friend which comes by once in a while with supplies in exchange.   Graphics  The graphics are what to be expected from a game in 2014. They have created an almost Borderlands type of filter, so it looks a bit cartooney or like it's drawn by hand. The skybox is a bit lacking in my opinion, the clouds do not fit in with the rest of the game so well, but I see where they are going with it, they just made it a bit too much 'hand drawn on paper'. But overall it's almost stunning how good they set the mood with the graphics alone.   Sound  The soundtrack of this game is also amazing, it really fits in with the story and setting. I never buy soundtracks for games but for this I am considering buying it, maybe.   Prize/Rating  If you buy this game for the story, not the gameplay, you will have a great experience and a huge 'aha' moment at the end. It's even fun to play through a second time when you know all the lore and understand everything that is being said. I played through it in a day, so it's not so long. It's 3€ too expensive in my opinion but still worth the money. I'm hoping for some sort of sequel, or even a prequel because the story is so rich and it would be interesting to see how other people live, and what the cities look like.",

Although you can walk around the map and there is some transportation, not as much as you would expect.  I beat the game in 7 hours, with a bit of walkthrough tips. Totally worth the $13 I paid for it,. I just with I could of paid $26 abd got 7 hours more. 4 out of 5 STARS",

So if you're not into that there's a way out. The block games aren't that hard once you get the concept though. Another thing to note is that the 'Clue' feature is not a Hint feature but a task list. It tells you what you are supposed to do. I tried going at the game without using any hints and ended up spending 2 hours running around accomplishing nothing of value. I half-finished some things here and there and now after having completed the game realize how much of a waste of time it was. My only complaint about the game is that the named the task list 'Clues'. Though I'm sure there are some who'd be willing to spend the time necessary to finish the game without he 'Clues'...

It's a story about finding out how the apocalypse happened and what happened to Ida personally. I would not pick it up for full price. No you don't get to be invovled with the robot (Ida)romantically for those out there that maybe into that. To be fair, I kind of wish this was a possibility. you do get to choose dialog so why not add it in devs?  This game reminds me a lot of the look of fallout 4 as well, minus the clouds...but it plays nothing like it. There are no major quests to go on, nor combat. I was wondering if the game might be like it, but for 12 dollars, you can't expect that. When it comes to tasks, you'll only be going back and forth between your yurt(home) and a park. When you first see it...it's jaw dropping. After the first visit it's just meh and feels like a chore...lol  The minigames can be frustrating and sometimes the most fun you'll have in the game. You can choose to skip them and progress.  If I had to rate, 6/10. Ending was just disappointing as I've said. I think it should be turned into a full game where you can have a future with Ida where she also has functional legs.",

Set somewhere in Mongolia, you play as Enebish (or so the game tells you..) the grandson of your late grandfather and parents. You wake up with amnesia not remembering anything of your previous life. The only connection you have to the past is a robot named Ida. She is far from being functional though at the beginning of the game, you have to search the yurt you live in for parts to fix her and play minigames in the large structure behind your home called The Gerbera Garden to earn parts for her. Cradle is full of mystery and puzzles both strategy based and for the mind. It is a post apocalyptic game but it is a peaceful game that will keep you thinking and exploring for hours, even though it is a relativly short game. I still want to explore the surrounding area further now that I have finished the main storyline. This game is so detailed, you will lose items quickly!!! I lost so much important stuff in the yurt that I had to restart the game from my save point multiple times. Its one of those games that you have to play alone with headphones, it is so immersive that to get the whole experience you need to seclude yourself for a good 6 hours.

Besides I haven't found many places of interest on it. I didn't really like the minigame which you have to play three times during the course of the story, fortunately you can skip it after you lose.
