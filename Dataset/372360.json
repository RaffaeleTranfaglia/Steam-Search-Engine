            "review_text": " UPDATE : Since this review's getting hits, might as well make it more proper.  This game was launched with many issues, such as:   10-15 second delays when entering settings, save, and load menus   launch times taking upwards of a minute   obvious typos ('contorols')   broken menu alignments   the locked 720p that changes your monitor's resolution (what is this, 2002?)   artifacts of this port being based on the PS3 port   many tutorial dialogs mixing up PS3, Xbox 360 controller, and keyboard controls   and much more  As of this writing only the menu delay seems to be fixed...for me, most of the time. It returned _once_ about 4 hours into a binge, but has otherwise not been an issue. It looks like they're fixing issues but if I were considering to buy this product, I'd wait until they produced a few more updates before actually purchasing this port. It seems the bad press is forcing Namco to act. This is sad, since Zestiria's port was actually pretty good. A little rushed and buggy, but not in any way that disrupted gameplay.  Tales of Symphonia itself is a classic Tales game from 2003, and it's the first ever 3D Tales game. This port is a more or less the remastered PS3 version ported to PC.  Like all Tales games, it uses the Linear Motion Battle System where you move your character in real time across a 2D line on a 3D battlefield -- between yourself and whatever enemy is selected. It plays much like a fighting game or a brawler in that you make real time attacks, perform combos, and need to defend or evade like you would in a brawler. Of course like an RPG, you have 3 other AI controlled party members and you can order them occasionally, but usually they'll just do their own thing. This game's unique gimmicks are Unison Attacks and Overlimits, the former being a bonus attack similar to QTE's and the latter just seems to happen randomly. Unfortunately those Unison Attacks use a PS3 controller interface and I can never seem to get all four to execute.  It's pretty awkward compared to current Tales games...the most notable aspect is this game came out before free roam existed, but while jumping was still an option. So you can't run around to flank enemies, but there are aerial abilities you can perform to achieve the same effect. Having played Phantasia before any others in the series, it wasn't too difficult to pick up on. It's still the awesome battle system that got me hooked on the series.  I had issue with the controls...it might be my 360 controller, but navigating the map was a pain since it uses push sensitivity for walk/run and I'd often find myself walking. It's probably since I'm a PCphile that I settled on using keyboard controls. The default controls are for people whose arms are 3 inches apart, but after switching to WASD + numpad I found gameplay to be pretty enjoyable.  I'm not going to comment on the story until I get further through. 8 hours is too few to judge...but so far it's a mix of a pretty lighthearted party in a pretty bleak world.  Graphics are...720p. They're a notable improvement over the Gamecube graphics but still seem a generation behind for the most part. Also they're quite blurry, being locked at 720 arbitrarily. Bit of a weak point for the game.  The soundtrack is the kind you'd actually make the effort to purchase separately. Not only do I prefer melodic over ambient, I love Motoi Sakuraba's style.  Anyway, I plan on changing my thumbs down into a thumbs up,  but not until this port is fixed.    THERE WAS NO EXCUSE.",

            "review_text": "  Best described as the FF7 of its series, ToS is the one that helped the franchise really breakout in the west. I owned a GameCube, but ultimately decided the console wasn't worth constantly plugging and unplugging and let it gather dust because PS2, so I passed up on this title. Over ten years later, I ended up preordering Zestiria to get the bonus Symphonia and see what the fuss was about.  ToS launched in a deplorable state. Bamco launched the highly anticipated port of one of their most beloved titles as an unstable, buggy mess, which I'm pretty sure violates several Dwarven Vows. Months later, they finally updated it into a workable, playable game that doesn't require a fan-made mod to not be awful (but still helps).  The story initially revolves around a trio of friends: a swordsman named Lloyd, a tolerable child mage named Genis, and Colette, the 'Chosen of Mana'. The mercenary Kratos and their teacher, Raine, soon join up. Colette is foretold to regenerate the world and save humanity from the Desians, half-elves who keep humans in work camps and see themselves as a superier race. The story quickly complicates as more characters appear and the story unfolds.  The battles are real-time. You target an enemy, move away or close the distance. One button allows you to use standard attacks while another uses one of four assigned special attacks depending on whether or not you use it with a directional button. The result is a fast and fun system that allows and rewards combos. The characters you don't control can have their AI customized and specific attacks disabled. Stat growth can also be influenced by assigning 'titles', which are awarded by story events or in-game achievements.  The game starts out sticking closely to its tropes before throwing them out the window. How it bends and twists things were more novel at its launch, but many of them aren't as special now that other games have done the same. The game also doesn't do the best job of hiding some of its twists, or simply foreshadows far too hard. The writing and voice acting is still solid, and certain parts WILL leave you feeling emotional.  The game is stable and plays very well, and TSFix (check the forums) enhances it further. The 30 FPS cap is still annoying, but tolerable. The game has aged well, and I found myself wanting to hurry home so I could resume playing it. I've come to kick myself for not buying it back when it was new. Depsite its initial issues, the current product is enough to make a Tales fan out of me.  shadow and lightning temples can still go to hell though",

As it is now, there's no slowdown, no graphical hiccups, no more VMPROTECT and it works like charm on my Windows 7. The only major quarrels about it would be the 30 FPS compared to the Gamecube version (But considering this is a port of the PS3 HD version, which was locked on 30 FPS, there's little point in complaining about that) and the fact that using directional arrows on the keyboard to move the character during block puzzles will prevent them from pushing or pulling the blocks, (Still, you can simply change the button config when that happens IF you're using a keyboard). As it is now, the game is perfectly playable and enjoyable in all of its beauty, and I'm glad I was patient enough to have it in working order on my PC after loving it on the Gamecube!",

            "review_text": "Among innumerable other issues, this game was shipped with 3 crippling limitations: 1) VMProtect implementation (FIXED via removal in the latest official path). This intrusive anti-tamperware forced the game to run in a virtual machine, massively slowing down startup times and making unnecessary, constant writes to your disk drive. It also briefly prevented modders from working to fix the issues detailed below. 2) Locked internal resolution of 720p. 3) Locked framerate of 30 FPS.  Namco has yet to do anything about the latter two issues. However, the locked resolution has been resolved by modders in addition to the numerous other improvements they have made. The frame rate, sadly, has yet to see a fix. I'd recommend waiting to buy this until it's genuinely the best version of the game to play, which IMO it won't be until the frame rate limiter has been overcome by the modders, which appears unlikely given the difficulties they have encountered, or patched out by the devs via a miracle.  Oh, and of course, shame to the devs for releasing a port in this state, yadda yadda, they don't care, etc.",

            "review_text": "Tales of Symphonia is a JRPG that was first released in 2003 for the GameCube, later ported to the PS2 &amp; PS3, and ported from the PS3 to the PC in 2016.  For a game which is a port of a port it holds up pretty well, at times the controls can feel a bit clunky especially considering you need a relatively fast reaction time during some battle sequences, but they're not a complete disaster.   This game held a fair amount of negative press when it was first ported to PC because the port was done quite poorly. It received a big update in late September which ironed out a lot of the issues which were related to the port (save bugs, slow loading times etc).   As for the game itself, the visuals are decent considering the game is 13 years old, the combat is pretty fun, the soundtrack is quite good and I think the storyline and characters are really solid. The game originally had a lot of bad press on release and was criticised for having a weak plot, but I actually consider it one of the better plots of a game I've played in recent memory.  Overall I'd probably give the game an 8/10. I imagine if I'd played it on the GameCube when it was first released I'd probably give it a 9/10, but the game is still definitely worth playing and is a good installment in the Tales series.",

Once you start playing it, the storyline is very addictive as heck as you want to find out what's going on and who is the true villian to fight. The music was awesome to listen to and all of the characters were all good to play with.  The Controls for this game are surperb. So if you are looking for a great RPG game with a extremely good and immersive storyline then this game is for you.  Now all that we need is for Namco Bandai to release the rest of the Tales series on Steam and to also fix some gramatical issues in this game.",

The combat is tab targeted but fun hack and slash. Despite being able to switch between characters you only seem to be able to play as Lloyd and the charcter switching is for plot reasons, that's fine but if Lloyd dies your other party members will make no atempt to revive and you kind of have to toss orange gel at kratos and hope he kills everyone. I also just recently learned there's a jump function but that's probably more on me.  I've had no problem using this with an xbox 360 controller and the only thing i dislike about it so far is there's no way to speed up the comic book style cutscenes between characters.",

One of my favorite games as a kid on gamecube, Story is awesome. Lots of plot twists and character depth and personality for a game that comes off kinda PG-rated. Still remember being awestruck when you find out who Lloyd's real father is, as well as when you find out about how both worlds affect each other. I remember the combat being a lot harder than what my current experience is, but then again, now I'm using blocking and dodging and not just jamming on the attack buttons. The combat is pretty straight forward if you've played any amount of JRPGS. Battles happen in real-time and are not turn based but the battle pauses if you bring up the in-battle item menu or if you're targeting a different enemy - which I like. Also, each weapon actually has its own unique aesthetic when you're in-battle. There are these fire/ice blades you get for Lloyd somewhere near end game and they look badass.   Look at it this way: It released on Gamecube, then they ported it to PS3, and then they ported it to PC.   Obviously this game is ♥♥♥♥ing great.",

Sure it could look better but who cares, Anytime there's glowing reviews of a retro pixel game, it's pretty much unanimously agreed upon that graphics aren't important - it's gameplay and/or story that matters - but as soon as a game is locked at 30 fps everyone is outraged.  I realize that I'm reviewing this game after several patches, and I know that upon the games release, it was kind of a mess, and I know that the original GameCube version looked better, but I don't care. As it is now, I think the game looks and runs great and I have no complaints.   As of this writing, I've only put a half hour into the game, mainly to see how it looked, so there may be plenty of bugs and glitches ahead. If that's true I'll change my review, but I wanted to add my two cents to the uproar about how the game looks.  In short, I think the game looks good and don't feel that that should be a hinderance in anyone's decision to buy it. And I know from past playthroughs that the game itself is great.",

You can rebind your keyboard controls which is cool for keyboard users and supports 360 controller fully, even having the correct buttons on screen. At a constant 30 FPS for a low-tier machine, the game is still incredibly smooth. So smooth that if someone tinkered with files to put it to full 60 FPS it would make the game not break, but not look good. If you have played a Tales game before, the combat will feel familiar to you. Story is take it or leave it. I personally have no issue with it, the typical hero must go on a journey to save the world, etc. The english voiceovers are well done, something the Tales game is pretty solid at with each game, however you can choose Japanese voiceovers if you want to.  Cons: -Everything looks a bit too large in terms of proportions (as in the models, the world, etc.) -The story if you don't care for it. Pros: -Runs smoothly -No major gamebreaking bugs have been reported. -Combat is fun and intuitive. -Opens up fine for me, but seems to be a common issue. -High customizable controls for both controller and keyboard. -English voiceovers are well done.  In my opinion, this is a very well done port, and for 20 bucks is worth it. At the very least, worth trying it out.",

Much like Tales of Zestiria, the first PC 'Tales of' game, the framerate is locked at 30fps.  There appears to be no mouse support, yet the mouse still is visible in fullscreen mode.  Startup time is a bit long, and the game hangs whenever accessing the Save, Load, and Customize(options) menus, both from the title screen or while playing. Don't think it crashed, it has taken up to a minute for me to load any one of these menus(and on a PC that can flawlessly run Tales of Zestiria on max). All other menus appear to have no issues, both in and out of combat. With the exception of the initial startup and those three menus, the game load times are as fast as expected.  I enjoy that they included the original theme/opening, rather than the one that the US received in the GameCube release, and the presence of the Japanese voiceovers is nice.  As a long time JRPG player, and a long time fan of the 'Tales of' series, with Tales of Symphonia being my favourite, I would highly recommend Tales of Symphonia to anyone that loved the GC or PS3 release, anyone who enjoys other 'Tales of' games, and to anyone that loves a good JRPG with an amazing storyline.  I myself can't wait to get the chance to just sit down and dive back into Sylvarant, and head off to regenerate the world.",

Tales of Symphonia is still a game I recommend to people to get them started in the Tales series. It's one of the series' defining games. It's incredibly fun to play, and the story is engaging right from the start.  That being said, it's by no means perfect. It lacks a lot of features that make later games even better. Despite the battles taking place on a 3D plane, there's no free movement, as you're restricted to an X axis between you and the enemy you're targeting. The story, while it's pretty good, isn't as polished as a lot of the other series' games. It's also packed with plot twists, almost to a fault. The game in general just really shows its age. It's a dated game. But it's still an essential part of the Tales series.  tl;dr if you can't stand games made over a decade ago then don't play",

In my 31 hours of playing game, I experience not a single bug, everything was smooth and without crushing or corrupted save files.  By the look of the game you might think that the story and characthers are childish, but in fact story is very deep and complex, questioning religion, racial racism and it is perfectly applied to our modern world. Charachters are great and complex, although maybe the main Lloyd is kinda stereotyped. :)  Gameplay is classical for that time, there is always dungeon with light puzzle elements (that ar becoming fairly harder towards the end of the game), every dungeon is filled with enemies that are made with great imagination and it is joy to fight them . After completing dungeon, in most time u go visit new city where stoy untold and u can purchase new weapons, armors and items and explore it.   Fight in battle is 2D, where you control 1 characthers, other 3 are via AI, or u can manually make them use certain spells an abilities. I didnt find game hard, so maybe battle can become more like button smashing, but i never felt bored or tired due to great looks of enemies, splashy spells and that ultra mega combo attacks that looks awesome :D .  I could spend easily more than 50 hours , but I didnt have time to do sidequests, or to get most powerful weapons and to explore every place on the map.

Needless to say, I was hooked from the get-go. Everything was awesome. However, I will admit the battle system took me by surprise. I was still used to turn-based systems at the time, so the real-time battles threw me off. But then I started treating the battles more like a fighting game and persevered.  The thing that struck me most about this game is how much raw detail they go into exploring just how horribly prejudice and bigotry affects all the people involved in it, not just the ones who are the targets of said victimization. They even show that the Big Bad is someone who had the most heroic ideals at first, then became corrupted into something really horrifying and twisted. You even feel sorry for him by the end of things, which is a really deep storytelling move most games (or hell, most story-telling mediums period) don't delve into very much, because we want to keep deluding ourselves that things are black-and-white.  Another thing that struck me about the game is that despite how bright and colorful the game appears, it's still a pretty dark story. There's part of the story that are dilebrately shown in the game to overtly convey how crappy things are, such as the human ranches. But there's other things in the subtext of the game that if you really think about it, you're like 'Cripes, this is ♥♥♥♥ed up ♥♥♥♥ that they're doing. Why wasn't anything done to stop it before?!'.  Anyway, when I found out this game was coming to Steam, I was delighted. Especially when I found out it was based on the PS3 version, which I could never get. Why 'especially'? Because the PS3 version was based on a then Japan-only PS2 port of the game which had additional stuff put into it, from costumes to story details which weren't in the original GCN version.  Now, I should go on record and say that I purchased this game on Steam the day it came out for full price because I wanted it so much. I also had Windows 7 at the time. It worked perfectly, even when I set it up to be played in a window, I also managed to record a first impressions video of it, which you can find on my profile if you're interested. *cough*shameless self-promotion*cough* Anyway, I was blown away by how much crisper the game looked to me. The game text was also a bit easier to read. The voice acting and localization were still top-notch.  Basically, if you want an RPG where they deconstruct the notion of a 'Chosen One' and also have both the heroes and villains alike are morally complex than they first appear, this game has that in spades. Hell, if you love RPGs, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try.  Also, ignore the initial reviews of this port, because I feel like they're just being resentful that it doesn't have the specs they wanted, like 60FPS, which hardly makes a difference in my mind. The game still plays well, and that's what truly matters at the end of the day.",
