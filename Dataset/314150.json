You may want to set the scanlines to about 20 for that old CRT TV look and feel. If you were into the Double Dragon games back in the day, buy this. If you're too young to remember how awesome the Double Dragon games were back in the day, buy this. There's nothing better than seeing where some of the great games of today came from.",

Online Coop is extremely broken. All 3 games crash all the time and the net code is horrible. You will not be seeing the same thing as your online co-op buddy. For example: You may be on a boss, but your online coop buddy is still 2 previous stages behind, but he thinks he's on the boss too.  Local co-op works for the most part, but it's a shame there's no option to turn off friendly fire. No unlimited continues for arcade mode was a horrible choice too. Story mode is a different story and there shouldn't be unlimited continues. To each his own.  Double Dragon III was the easiest and Double Dragon II was the hardest due to the last boss. His shadow move is hard to dodge, but not impossible.  A couple of times I had to actually kill myself in game in order for the game to proceed. Occasionally stairs wouldn't acknowledge I was even there and fell off to my death. The game would often crash in local co-op and would have to exit to desktop and then enter back to fix the issue. Online co-op isn't even worth it and should be ignored.  These games are basically some crap iOS ports and not done well at all.  Not even worth $1. Beware. Grab Double Dragon Neon instead!",

I personally haven't had any tech issues with this port and the endings that were missing have been patched in.   Overall: Good trip down memory lane for those old enough and worth the cheap price for the nostalgia . For newcomers to the series or those looking for the NES versions, it may disappoint. Most notably the games are very short.",

Like many that written review before have said the hit detection seems to be bit off, but nothing that would keep this game down if they work on it a bit. It is nice to have an old friend back on steam. Thank you for bringing it back. This isa must have for Arcade freaks such as myself!",

If this is unfamiliar to this game, do yourself a favor and play it as most of your gaming elder's had played several hours of this, battle toads, and a few other classics.  How the game works you ask? You sit at the beginning and learn what buttons punch and kick, possibly grab?...you then walk around, identifying that your screen will only move to the right. You push on and cross the baddies as you use your previously learned skills, Punch, kick, grab, throw, and walk right....repeat. (Maybe throw in a random jump! Pro tip - jumping works great right before you kick.)",

This ports are working for the most part, but the music flags are wrong, the weapons don't work correctly, the resolutions in the third one are completely screwed...   Don't buy them. Get MAME, and play there, the emulation is flawless, no like this one.",

I would buy this even at the regular price but got it on a steam weekend deal,it's got steam achievements and trading cards,awesome remixed music and a few tweeks that make it better than the coin'op as well as filters,worth it.",

Big thanks for remastering the Double Dragon Arcade games of old, old school gamers like me grew up on these when they filled the arcade halls of late 80s and early 90s. The remake is very close to the original but there are a few things auido and graphic wise which are not identical to the original, I have this on MAME32 Emulator which is 100% identical for comparison. The 3 games are great fun and takes you back to in time, they also have the option to change resolution and music/audio track which gives a slightly different feeling whilst playing this old school beat em up. All in all if you played these back in the day then do yourself a favor and grab this and keep it for those rainy days or to show the youth of today what games were before it became a business industry focused on profiting from the very concept that my generation invented to escape the boredom of business and work.
