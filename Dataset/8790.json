Also, the game doesm't hold your hand and force control off you (unless you want it to) meaning that unlike the Codemasters F1 games you actually drive the entire race. Pitlanes and post-race inlap.  16/10",

So you can't do much about the problem. Sad With the worst behaving cars (e.g. Toledo) you basically have to wait... ...until the front of the car is inside 20º in relation to the following straight. Then you can apply throttle.  still, a very good and realistic game but I'll stick with rFactor   final lightening: I saw a review of 'chegster' he called F1 2012 a sim",

            "review_text": "GTR 2 is not a bad game. It is only $8 and it isnt worth it. But i got board of it after 1hr,the AI's are suicidal,the tracks are horribly modeled,you cant drive in the pits and it only has GT cars. No matter what you do u cant get your car to slid out its like an arcade game... The graphics are horrible as well,the sky and tree's are just a real life picture then everything else is 3D. This game has some pro's. -All weather conditions(excluding fog and snow). -Driving school -Porshe(which are all gray because this game didnt get the licence for the steam edition) Those are the pro's. I definitivly do not recomend getting this game,oh,and the music,you can turn on ingame music wich is horrible,but just my opinion. This game did false advertising when i wanted to get it,i was expecting well modled tracks,proper AI and Porshe,i didnt get any of that. I do not recomend getting this game,oh,the multiplayer does not work either. This game is for you if you want a cheap arcade game. And it does not keep track of your time,i have probably 10hrs on record,not 0.01.",

Physics is great, you can mod it(i do not reccomend there are many amatour mods, but some great too). Graphics are a bit old, but in simracing graphics are not the most important.",
