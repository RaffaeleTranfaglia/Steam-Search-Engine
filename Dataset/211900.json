    "description": "Conquest of Elysium 3 (CoE3) is a streamlined turn based fantasy strategy game with a touch of rogue-like and the complex undertones of Illwinter's Dominions series. While CoE3 appears to be a simple game with limited options at first glance, delving further into the game reveals a game of complex decision making and risky endeavors.",

Instead of armies, you have individual troops that make up an army, and you march them around. There are tons of races, units, map types, and random events. Really fun stuff, different every time you play, it's a good game. Single player and Multi-player both are good.",

            "review_text": "This game is actually a pretty good strategy game. It's like what many reviewers are saying, that it is deeper than it first appears. It's kind of like master of magic except you can't go into your town and build buildings and stuff. It's more like Heroes of might and magic where you explore the map, fight battles, and gain control of strategic locations that increase your resources. The resources are then used to increase your army strength.  Be aware that the battles are automatic. No battle tactics, only tactics on the strategic map.  Keep in mind, there is no town/castle management. Also it is not very pretty. There is no tutorial or even anything to read on how to play. There is a list of keyboard controls that you can bring up. By continuously bringing that list up and experimenting I was able to figure out how to play after 3 or 4 little test games.  There is 10 or so different leaders to start out with and they are pretty different. Some use magic and can summon guys to fight. Others might only be able to recruit guys with money you earn. It's worth the money just not real nice to look at.  Working just fine in Linux Ubuntu 14.04. Goes full screen. Playing it on the living room TV. Somethings are a bit hard to see but it is doable.",

            "review_text": "Bought it, Playd it for 12 hours straight, was up until 4 in the morning, Worth it. This game is very unique due to the face that when you go into a battle you dont actualy control what ANY of your monster/people/demons/ghosts... Etc do. and some of the abilites are extreamly entertain, And the monster are Freaky and extreamly cool too just by the way that they look and how they attack. So if your interested in games like this then it is DEFFINETLY worth checking out it was honestly worth the $9.99 even tho the graphics arnt the BEST the game is still AMAZING so i would give it a 9/10. But yeah its definetly worth checking out. ",

Because Illwinter draw on their endless resources from Dominions, this game has simple gameplay but improbable faction variety and depth. If you're a bit undecided, get it on a sale - you'll certainly not be disappointed. I know I wasn't. There's simply no other games that deliver quite the same experience.",

At first I bumbled around not knowing what anything did but after a while, I realized how everything worked.  50+ hours later it's become one of my favorite ways to waste a few hours.   Things you'll definitely like: It's a solid Turn Based Strategy.  Quite a few choices of who to play as, and what the world you play in will be like.  Units differ greately from nation to nation.  Unique time periods that you can play in, each with it's own special randomized tidbits to throw your armies at.  If you get into it, it'll eat a few hours of your life and you'll love every minute of it  Things you might not like:  You don't control how the fights go down. You will learn to hate woodland creatures as they terrorize you.  You'll have to spend a while getting the hang of anything.  Your best wizard will only cast his worst spell, every turn.  There is always something hiding somewhere, and you'll run into it when you don't want to.   All in all, it's probably the most fun game I've spent 10 dollars on steam to have.   9 deer mauling men in armor/10",

Move, attack, trade. recruit, etc. But while the mechanics themselves are simple, they're executed perfectly, and set the framework for what's really a complex strategy game.  The game offers 17 starting characters, all of which have their own unique playstyle and mechanics. The Baron can enlist locals to defend their towns and villages free of charge; the Necromancer can reanimate the dead to aid in battle, etc. etc. During combat your commanders might find magic items to aid in their conquest. I've only encountered one so far, which was the Bottle of Living Water. This item let my commander summon a powerful Water Elemental during battle. Awesome.  The amount of factions to try, and the amount of combinations to make while recruiting soldiers for your armies is insane. This game is definitely worth the price.",

Graphics are simple but completely adequate - again, contributing to the board game feel. Duly described as a 'fantasy roguelike', Conquest of Elysium 3 plays quick and is great fun: with all its lovely details, it sparks the player's imagination and creates an immersion not often experienced.

Since I have other more fun games in my library not being played I leave this game for a later time.
