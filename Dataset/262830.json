New graphics and not as pretty, new UI is bland and forgettable, and the worst crime of all - the Perks are gone from the quest mode. That's right, they only exist in Survival, which I know some people don't even play.  You would be much better suited by playing the original version 1.9.8.",

            "review_text": "Crimsonland was originally released back in 2003 and despite not being overly popular, was well loved by those who played it. And now, more than ten years later it is once again hitting the metaphorical shelves and coming to steam and PS4.Crimsonland offers several ‘survival’ modes and a whole bunch of quests to play through. Quests are short challenges where you will need to kill all enemies without dying. Despite being so simple in their rules, quests vary a whole bunch due to the weapons you are given and the enemy types you need to defeat. Monsters vary from zombies to spiders, lizard-men to aliens but all want to eat your face equally as much. Enemy movements, speed and attack patterns are all different and have unique abilities.Also you have a whole bunch of weapons at your disposal which are gradually unlocked as you proceed through the main quests. A lot of the time you start off with just the pistol and can collect new weapons dropped by enemies, but some quests give you additional firepower to begin with.Power-ups and perks play a large part in your survival. Perks are – like weapons – unlocked through completing quests and grant you many different effects such as increased evasion of enemy attack, faster shooting, more power, and more experience points that in effect give you more perks. There are some very interesting perks that make your choice very difficult, like a 50/50 perk that either gives you a whole bunch of experience points, or just kills you outright.After a short while the battlefield will become coated in blood and littered with monster corpses; hence the title. Depending on how good you are at dodging and how quick you are at killing, your screen very slowly becomes more crowded until you have nowhere left to run and get swarmed by various species of monsters. Crimsonland is one of those very simple games that is very easy to pick up and play, but extremely difficult to master. Everyone who plays it will have their own idea of the best perks to pick, their favourite weapons and their own tactics in how to deal with certain enemies. Crimsonland may have roots in a 10 year old game, but this remake proves itself a worthy successor.",

The point of whole game for me is to shoot monsters, gain EXP and grow stronger with perks.  2. Telekinisis pulls unwanted weapons. Have you ever seen such a badass guy chased by a small blowtorch and have no where to run before?  3. Saving perks such as bandage or breathing room for emergency usage in survival mode is no longer a valid strategy.  4. Nests are spawned randomly in survival mode now, which makes the game even more unpredictable.   5. The old version had a larger view range, even larger than this new version with the eagle eye perk (or whatever name the perk is called, i can't remember exactly).  Sorry 10tons, but playing the new Crimsonland just make me wanna play the old version more and more.  (sorry for my poor english, it is a second language for me.)",

Loads to do with many modes, and given the random nature of things even replaying a previous level for a better result never feels the same.  Graphics are ok, could have been better but for accessability to lower systems they are just fine and the music could not have been better compliments the game very well and is high quality.  Time can fly by playing this game and is made 10 times better if you have some joypads and some friends to play with with upto 4 ppl local.  Is it worth the £10.59 asking price, for me it is not. I recived as part of a £6 bundle including 7 games and at that price was a steal. ",

Con's -Only one I could find really was that I prefer some of the older models of enemies. But the old version of the game is included so can't complain about the game at all.

Big no is that the Highscore is completely hacked like in 2003. Almost 12 years later they should have fixed that ^_^  However, the price is a ripoff. Just wait until it is reduced more than -50%.

This is a huge setback for strategic users of the 'Bandage'. You can not leave it in the list and use it at the time you need it the most. What a let down coming from the coder. What was he thinking? 3- In sake of increasing the number of power-ups, the screen resolution has became a 'power up', so you can see better only if it ends up in your power-up list.  There are also some bugs like, right after the 'reflex boost' if you have a slow fire rate weapon and the fast shoot option is still available, the fire rate is not consistent. This is distracting the focus and you immediately think that you have to seek another fast shooting bonus.   As a summary, he made a big mess out of a beautiful game.

For quest, there is varying arenas of difficulty, with different challenges and enemy combinations to overcome. There's not really a story to quest mode other than 'Shoot 'em all!', which is good enough for me!  There are also several different kinds of survival modes, including seeing how long you can last without a gun.  Fallout may have popularized Perks in games, but Crimsonland was the first to bring it to shooters, which is probably one of the things that makes it such a great game. The massive amount of guns combined with numerious perk combos ensures you never get the same game twice.  And if you like secrets, there are several of those scattered around as well. ;)  Considering the game was originally released in 2003, it has aged pretty well.

            "review_text": "I loved this game so much in it's own age, and I was very glad to see it making a return on steam, but even if unrealisticly overpriced, it's the type of game you can wait any long time for to go on sale. As part of a Humble Bundle pack I did not regret buying it, however I sadly cannot honestly recommend buying it on PC, for 3 reasons.  1. This isn't the game we loved back then. It has an awful new gigantic UI and 'click in the corner for a new player to join', making it very clear they relased the android port on PC instead of simply re-relasing the old client with added compatibility. Sadly, much of the nostalgia factor is killed off because of it.  2. The game didn't age very well, on it's own and relatively to the rest of the market. We just passed or may still live in years where mass wave survival shooters are getting relased every week, and among them Crimsonland simply cannot stand, for it's extremely cheap looking and while undoubtedly fun but very unimaginative and boring powerups and weapons just doesn't offer anything that could make it stand out and say - buy me over this or that, because... ?  3. The price. It's unreasonably high for a game that is about 15 year old, and adds nothing to the original other than an uncomfortibly huge UI and steam achievements.  However, as I mentioned I picked up the game in Humble Bundle, and it also came with it's android version. I played that a LOT. I mean, a LOT. I remember spending days, added together easily weeks at work (yeah... well, we had nothing to do for hours a day quite often those times...) and having so much fun with it. The touchscreen controls and the higher difficulty levels together really create an extremely challanging gameplay and obviously the new UI is designed to work well there.  Pick up the android version, and just remember the old PC version as something you had fun with as a kid, and let it be remembered that way instead of ruining it with this new PC version. If you haven't played it, ever, still recommended for phones / tablets, but you are better off spending your money on a similar but better arena survival game on PC.",

I had forgotten about it until I picked it up on GOG when the HD remaster was released and it's been my goto de-stressing game ever since. I picked it up on Steam a couple months ago as part of a bundle and I've been having lots of fun playing it on the go. This game is a pretty basic top down shooter with in-game powerups and weapons. The game gets pretty challenging as the hardness level increases, but for most it shouldn't be too hard to get 3 stars on each of the missions on normal play. I definitely recommend this game for anyone that likes a run, shoot, don't think too much type of game. The monsters offer a nice variety of challenge. The spiders add plenty of creepiness factor. Definitely worth a sale price purchase of around $5 or less.",

One of my favorite parts of Crimsonland was the whole leveling up system on the quest mode, when I found out that it 'has been removed' I flipped and instantly disliked it. BUT there is an overcome frome that, press escape when in a quest level and type 'GRIM' (without the apstraphe)   I like the fact that some of the enemys and guns look slighlty different while keeping the same great soundtrack and noises.    P.S If you use the perk 'regression bullets' you would pretty much be unsopable, it is made for survival, it makes it so you can shoot while reloading, but of course while you are in quest mode there isn't any points.",

The comparison to how Americans treat each other is inevitable. Overall, I find Crimsonland to be highly cathartic. I use it for meditation; it assists in finding my Beta state in much the same way as the Lotus position helps yoga pratitioners. Play this game. It will change your life, foever, for the better.",
