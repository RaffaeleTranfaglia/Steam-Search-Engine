            "review_text": "Based on the reviews, I was expecting a really badly made game. However, I was somewhat surprised. Sure, Alpha Prime is nothing extraordinary, but it's not crap by any means either.  It's a standard corridor FPS with a story. If you like FPS games, there is nothing to complain about here, aside from perhaps the difficulty being a bit too high. I've played on Easy and even then some sections were unusually hard and caused me to die many times.  The story isn't bad either. Again, it's nothing groundbreaking, but for an FPS game it's pretty decent. Most FPS games don't make anywhere near the effort in the story department as Alpha Prime does. The cutscenes and the radio dialogue sections between the characters were a nice addition to keep the game interesting. Most characters were developed reasonably well in terms of personality.  The graphics are very nice. Considering the game came out in 2007, those are pretty decent visuals, even by today's standards. The music is also not bad. There are only about 1 or 2 jarring heavy rock tracks, but the rest of the soundtrack is pretty good and gives a nice epic feel to the battles.  The enemy variety could've certainly used some work. You spend a good 80% of the game just fighting spec ops, which gets repetitive eventually. There are some other gameplay sections added too, like hacking, and using a loader to move boxes out of the way, which is a nice change of pace, even if some sections were quite annoying. The loader in particular was difficult to control, and having to move a dozen of boxes out of the way just felt like a waste of time.  In general the game is not as bad as the reviews claim it to be. It's just a standard, above average FPS that will keep you entertained for a few hours. If you are into the genre, give it a try, otherwise pass it up.",

What?!  Alpha Prime reminds me of the generic Doom clones that came out in the early 90’s when everybody and their mother was having a go at making these games. You wander down generic corridors, often without any objective. Robotic foes turn up and stand largely motionless while their hitscan weapons cause your health bar to deplete, and you fire back with an arsenal seemingly manufactured by Fisherprice,   Also who names their FPS protagonist Arnold?",

You shoot enemies, watch a cut scene, shoot some more, interact with something, repeat.A pretty shell for a game that's pretty lacking. Not much fun. Flashy weapon effects partially mask the mediocre gameplay, and to the untrained eye, Alpha Prime could almost pass as 'Doom 3'.All in all this game is solidly average. It’s a decent if predictable story saddled with a pedestrian game.",

            "review_text": "Game was a nostalgic blast for me. Solid shooter that clearly takes its influence from the Half-life 2 style era while looking like a prettier and more optimistic Doom 3. However it honestly has better gunplay than both. ADS, peeking, solid hit detection, good feeling to the guns, and challenging shoot outs with an optional bullet time element and some occasional triggerable eviromental bits through the game's 'hacking' feature. The game is also a lot of fun with how it lets you toy with the world around you with some gimmicky but fun physics that range from lifting lids off of crates for ammo to simply playing basketball in a gym room. Oh and no regenerating health, you find your supplies across dispencers and pick-ups like it should be done giving the game more depth and challenge. Its mostly raw solid gunplay and shooter action following familiar mechanics that works out pretty well. The game also has some of the best music I've probably heard in a long time from an FPS game, and the best part is it's free on their website.  The game attempts a story, but the less said about it might be for the best as it really isn't that great and far from the highlight of the game. By the end the plot seems a bit confused of itself and ends on a note that will likely just leave you scratching your head. Meanwhile another thing worth noting on the downside is that several of the game's special mechanics get a little underplayed on the last two levels with the bullet time recourse running low, and hackable objects basically removed from battles. The game is also critcized for near perfect AI aim, which is true but honestly I think it actually added to the fun. Peaking around corners and trying to hit headshots before they shot back at me was just a part of adapting to the gunplay and felt natural. The AI also moves around, doges, calls out orders, and fliches to damage also giving them more life and opening them up to weak points making their aimbot skills more tolerable.   At the end of the day I really enjoyed this game and it kind of made me sad we don't get games like this anymore. It had a weird plastic sci-fi feeling with amazing industrial techno rock music that felt right and sort of felt nostalgic of the 90's/early 2000's while giving me gameplay from a better era of corridor shooters. I'd recomend this game to people who grew up around an earlier era of FPS, or just want a bit of an escape from the current market for a good cheap action packed FPS. I suppose you could look at it as a cheesy fun comfort game in that regard. Oh and again, its cheap... $5.... considering people are buying retro 2D torture platformers for double or more, I'd say this is a steal of a deal by comparison.",

            "review_text": "Keep in mind, just because I'm voting 'recommend', doesn't mean you should actually play it by my recommendation, I just don't feel like a red thumbs down is very fitting of this game. If you have this game or have access to it for free, I would say go for it, but don't pay money for this, your time will be better spent on another FPS... or you know... in the real world.   The storyline is sort of bland: Arnold, your silver fox, body builder, genius badass is mining a mysterious radioactive ore on some planet in some fictional universe with humans. He is the only one not being driven mad and so you have to shoot your way out of the space ship and blah blah standard Sci-Fi FPS.  Spoilers ahead??? The differences: Oxygen depletion happens when you're not in a sealed structure or breathing directly through an oxygen mask on a wall. When outside, you have to move quickly and get to the next oxygen mask to strategically plan your next move. You can also save at any time and will probably need to do that a lot because of how often you die. There are a standard set of guns, although the flamethrower is sort of sadly useless... There are some cool tech gadgets, where you can hack cameras and mines through the walls before entering a room. Some missions require you to carry [giant] batteries with you to restore power to doors and such. So overall although they did mix it up and add some spice to the gameplay, its still primarily an (almost) outdated FPS.  The storyline is lacking, but certainly has some [randomly] brash lines, and decent voice acting. The protagonist has solid voice acting actually, in fact, one of the better voices I've heard considering the lines he was reading were complete ♥♥♥♥ half of the time. Some of the other characters sound like they read one line per day with the same inflection and different words, particularly the foreign guy without much experience in English.  The most memorable and worthy lines of the game, that convinced me to keep playing during a hard and honestly boring part:   'Arnold, you'll have to hold them off just a little bit longer!!!', says the other character while he was hacking a computer-motherboard-mainframe-core-system to save both of their lives.  'Why? So you can finish surfing porn?' Arnold is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a badass even when a tech guru is saving his life and he is shotgunning 20 dudes at once.  The game is hard, like 2007 hard. I'm saying like you can't just play this game through casually on normal difficulty because people will actually hit you with most of their bullets and rockets (Although, even in the hands of the villain, the flamethrower sucks ♥♥♥ unless you're stuck in an elevator with them).    TL;DR: I know I've just expressed a lot of conflicting like and dislike for this game, but that's how it feels to play it overall, you like it, and then you kind of wish you didn't spend an hour playing it, especially when you forget to save for a half hour and then get smoked by a big fat robot rocket.   Slow, tactful, diverse.  Enjoy.",

The other thing that really eludes me is what am I doing in the game. I assume there's a storyline and that there are explanations and reasons for what I'm doing, but I don't know them, and I have no idea when are they planning on telling me more than the fact that my name is Arnold. Third, I played the game for 20 minutes, and I already got 4 out of 8 weapons in the game. Why are you making it that easy on me? It's like this is going to be a hour and a half completion time for this game. Nevertheless I didn't really enjoy the game and I call it quits on this one. Some old games are fun to play, like Fable TLC and Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project for me, but this one isn't one of them, sadly.

Overall nothing in this game feels like a finished feature. 3 months more polishing and the game would feel a lot better.  As it is, the game is definitely not worth much. Although being an FPS game I do not think the combat has anything to offer really, so if you buy this game dirt cheap and want to play it through you should just drop the difficulty level to easy and run it through. Yes, you can play the game with higher settings but it does not make the game any more interesting as the combat is what it is.  I'd say the price cap for this game is around 2€.",

The voice acting is funny, thought you might think its corny. But alas, shooting stuff = fun.  And the best part about this game is you don't need a Average or HIGH powered computer. You can have a seriously weak computer and it will run fine.  7/10 I recomend this game to people who are nice, and don't have an agressive out-take on life. ie. easy going people.  Enjoy.",
