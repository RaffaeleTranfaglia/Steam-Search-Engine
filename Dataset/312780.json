            "review_text": "Never knew the life of a Ronin had so many things going for it until this game. It taught me that the life of a Ronin consists of:  Beating people to a pulp with the dull side of your sword and making them your pupil. Killing other Ronins while using a fish as a sword. Dressing up as Kenshin Himura and wandering around. Putting on as many accessories as possible. Disassembling cool swords so you can make your own and name it something cooler. Making phallic thrusting gestures at Japanese bar-maids with your british marine bros. Consensual night time fantasy break-in kinks. Putting way too much effort into trying to see if you could get with those foreign ladies. Then putting way too much effort into trying to see if you could get with that one British chick. Eating poison mushrooms and rotten Onigiri. Trying to steal some stuff from a pack of rabid dogs in a cemetery. Dueling a pretty swordswoman and telling her that if you win, she has to 'partake of my loins.' Stimulate some British guy so hard, he becomes a sushi chef disciple. Telling random girls on the street to open their borders. Allllllllllll of them. When that doesn't work, telling them that 'My boat docks at your harbor tonight.' Having the blacksmith work on your sword and then skip out on the bill. Bump into self while wandering around and then start fighting yourself. Getting boiled with some other Ronins, samurais, warriors and stuff due to the things you've done. Walking around town in a Fundoshi like 'What up, i got a Bigshot Laundry Pole.' Enjoy some masochistic torture time when you've been 'bad'.   I'm still not bored.  10/10",

            "review_text": "From a game developer's point of view, Way of the Samurai 4's concept is pure genius: create as few assets as possible and combine them to get as much variety as possible. And in practice, unlike many other such attempts, it works out surprisingly good!  From a player's perspective, there are a few things to consider before you dive in though. If you only want to go through the story, then you will probably get the worst ending in 2-3 hours of gametime and will feel let down, not having seen the vast majority of what the game has to offer. If you don't like the goofy humor of the game (you can check the screenshots to get a very good idea), you're gonna have a bad time. If you expect a AAA PC title with next gen graphics and full customizability, you are going to be disappointed since this is the port of a 5 years old console game with only very basic PC options, most of which are in the form of configuration files. (There's nothing inherently wrong with the port though, or at least it worked just fine for me and my XBox 360 controller but your milage may vary.) If you want to play every game on the hardest difficulty, you are probably also going to have a bad time. Although the only two options for a new character are Easy and Normal, these are more like Diablo's difficulty settings. You are not expected to play the higher difficulties with a new character.  With all that in mind, there's plenty of ways (of the samurai, wink-wink) to have fun in this game! First of all, you there's the main story with a bad ending, 7 easy to get endings plus 2 hidden endings you can get through manipulating events in previous playthroughs. That's right! The when you get to an ending, you will recieve a score based on how you performed and get Samurai points you can spend on unlocking new features like the Hard and Harikiri difficulty level, special customization options for your character or even new weapon style categories like Dual Wielding and Guns. Then you can start a new platyhrough with the same character, keeping your weapons, styles and also some of the major changes in the village will carry over and those changes will affect your new plathrough!  Then there's also the Dojo where you can train pupils and fight challengers who can drop special styles, there's nightcrawling which is a pretty stupid but fun 'dating' minigame, you can fish, you can do random missions for random NPCs for a little money, you can do questlines for a few named NPCs for lots of money, you can do some epic side quests if you do all questlines and get unique styles and weapons, you can forge your own weapons from parts, you can upgrade your weapons, you can get unlockable enchants on your weapons, you can fight with a fish as a weapon... The list goes on and on.  So yeah, I would recommend, if you don't expect it to be too serious and are willing to spend the time to explore the game in multiple playthroughs!",

            "review_text": "'I am a woman'  QUEST FAILED!  Lol, in all seriousness, I am biased about this series since I fell in love with the original game back on PS2. You play as a wandering murder-hobo (aka a ronin) who disambarks off a ship into a port town full of unreasonably-dressed warriors, numerous warring factions, and invincible animals... and I am not kidding about that last bit. You are encouraged to murder-hobo your way into the thick of things, nosily invading the political climate of the town and siding with one (or none) of the factions. You can side with the hilariously-goofy British Consulate, the tediously-boring Pranja Rebellion, the local town guardsmen, or you can sleep in for 4 days straight with no consequence, wake up and then slaughter everyone in a tournament. You can even start your own gym with one of the most proactive of recruiting practices I've ever seen, this side of a streetside preacher -- you beat the ever-living sh!t out of potential recruits, to which they will either accept your brutal teachings or kick you in the shins and walk away.  This game has a ton of fun things to do and it is meant to be played multiple times. However, for all that there is good about this game, there is some things that are bad.  If you have a serious problem with a 30 FPS game being offered and sold on Steam, best to leave this game alone as the comment section is full of subjective rants arguing about 'objective truths.' Here's the thing, this is a port from console to PC, and a lot of the game's mechanics are tied to a locked FPS. There is more technical details involved with this, but I'd encourage you to PM Ghostlight rather than troll through the discussion boards.  Another issue is that this game is a bit of a grind. Because you can play through multiple times, you are encouraged to use the last weapons you used/upgraded so as to improve them futher -- this is necessary on Hard difficulty and above. So yeah, the numerous charms required to make a fully-powered can be tought to get, depending on the weapon and weapon part involved.  The last major issue is the Day-One DLC. Here's the thing, none of it (except one, the Shinsengumi DLC) is required as all of the items therein can be found in-game. Its just that a majority of it is rare items and weapons, all of which can be found with their respective owners. Only the Shinsengumi DLC is encouraged to get, and its pretty cheap.  If you buy this game and don't like it, then ask for a refund. But if you give this game a chance, it might just surprise you.",

WOTS4 is an open-world non-linear action-adventure game with multiple endings and dialogue-choices, on the brink of being a Role-playing game. The game, as well as the rest of the series, is an extremely unrivaled exotic and cultural experience combined with the usual Japanese weirdness. Make your character, choose your moral, fight your fight, customize your weapon, do side-missions, have sex, recruit knife-wielding harlots to join your own dojo, do a flying kick in someone's mouth and much much more. The game does unfortunately have a frustrating flaw in its combat design though, making it easy to accidentaly hit innocents thus throwing them.....or the cops at you. The port might give you sound issues but this can mostly be fixed by adjusting the properties for your speakers etc. The game is subjectively unplayable and suicidal on mouse&amp;keyboard so i advise you to go for a gamepad.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Awarded for:  - Best Japanese PC Port (steam version) - Best Japanese game (original) - Best Musical Score (original) - Best Asian Game on Steam (steam version)  Porting Quality: 8/10 Game Score: 8/10 Re-playability: 7,9/10 Score compared to predecessor: 5/10",

You'll be familiar with everything almost instantly. - Certain parts of the interface are really unclear - You're never certain of the reason to use one type of style over the other (what is waki good for vs any other style type? Is it aesthetic? Who knows!) - The story and gameplay can be a little bit too open ended, leading you to bumble around like a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot your first playthrough - It's capped at 30 FPS if that's a problem for you.

Finally when you beat the game, you can move over to the next new game the weapons you had unlocked from your previous play through. Leading it to add even more replayability in terms of entertainment. I have been a fan of WotS since the original. WotS 1 is more of a serious toned Samurai Sphagetti Western where as a Samurai you can choose to fight the western expansion of guns, or join them to help finish off the samurai purist. This gives you no real tension in terms of a serious plot until nearly the very end. That being said, I am happy they picked a less serious tone  It gives WotS4 more character instead of a retread. I highly suggest trying this game. Classic Franchise.",

Yet this game is capped at 30 and I cannot stay above 21 fps. It makes combat slow, moving around rough and overall the game is unplayable. I played it for 4.5 hours and I can't get a refund, so Im pretty dissapointed with steam.   However, it is a jump ahead of way of the samurai 3 in terms of quality, gameplay and story.

Graphics have amateur problems that are REALLY obvious, even to someone who isn't getting into that kinda thing as a career, the animations and dialogue are sluggish and awful with huge gaps in between each action or person speaking. I liked where the story was going anyways, but then I experienced the god awful fighting system. Now, I'm not saying it's bad because I lost or anything, I actually did quite well with it, winning despite all the issues I saw with it. It was just really so bad I couldn't commit anymore after that.   I ran around a bit afterward. No hud map or anything, which was a little strange. Attempting to follow instructions the beginning cinematic gave to continue the story led to me standing outside some closed gates to the Magistrate (which I was told to immediately go to) with some bots who kept running into the wall and talking about sinks and hair accessories. o_e  I dunno about ya'll, but that is the worst first impression of a game I have ever seen.

This mechanic has been broken since inception and should not take up to WOTS5 to be fixed.   -moveset saved to character. Your moveset is no longer tied to which weapon you use in any way. This has to be the big one for me. why i gave it a negative review. In the past, WOTS was a sword collecting game for me. I would play the game through every possible ending in order to obtain every sword. Now that movesets tied to your character via skill books, and are obtainable from any random drop, this best feature is removed. You no longer need to find the ending in which you can kill that elusive gang leader in order to get his awesome sword so that you can finally bust out that jumping spin, because all you gain is...... a fancy hilt for a possibly below average crafted weapon? booooooo. terrible change.  -crafting system. Again, this crafting system furthers the removal of sword collecting. You obtain moves via skill books dropped by random enemies. You now disassemble different weapons and then reassemble their mixed parts to make your swords. These homemade swords are able to have great bonuses if you simply enter and exit the shop menu. Go ahead and fight almost nobody, and craft yourself an OP weapon. Difficult to obtain boss weapons not only dont grant you new moves, but the chances that they will hold any useful bonuses is minimal to zero. broken system.",

To compensate, the devs claimed it would ship with all dlc but thats a complete lie and all the DLC is seperate, meaning the game is further unreasonably priced than you might think  Here are the good things: Very strong and wide variety of weapons (albeit their use is lessened by a point I'll get to in a moment)  15 endings and a surprising number of missions in between, but most of them are fighting with the games very mediocore combat system  Interesting choices that actually matter and even carries on into other playthroughs (like opening a school for english to learn the british language for your next playthrough)  Humour is hit and miss its very 'SO RANDOM AMIRITE???' which may be fine for most, but don't expect Portal levels of wit from what is mostly a stock choice of characters  Here are the bad things:  Escort missions are even further undermined by the AI being phenomally stupid and running into enemies, Allies seem to walk around picking their nose and occasionally attack (allthough its more likely they were aiming for a fly nearby)  Swords seem to be made with paper and often break mid fight, instead of making cautious duels between opponents with precision attacks and cautious strafing, the game goes the dynasty warriors style of button mashing and occasional blocking when the enemy decides he has tme in his busy schedule to maybe think about possibly striking you, so enemies that are 'difficult' simply result in a boss with unreasonably long health bars.   There is a myriad of weapon styles for katanas and if your very lucky you might get a spear or gun for which to use in the next playthrough, but aside from the smithy, all the swords are usually found from bosses or random drops, so if you get into a situation where the smithy and his replacement is dead (A situation I got into because a mission uses the smithy's replacement out of nowhere for a boss battle) you get to eat **** and get stuck using martial arts or a blunt blade till you find a boss or group of enemies (Which are EXTREMELY hard to fight with the starting Martial Arts style)  Enemy lock on is finicky and often your character will face the wrong way when he gets up and never once did I find out hwo to switch targets because it wasn't any button on the controller as far as I could tell, not the DPAD, not the Right analog stick or shoulder buttons  The game often unfairly strings together boss battles during missions, forcefully depleting your reserve of healing items and whetting stones (to stop your cardboard swords from breaking)  Wait for a *huge* price drop before you buy this game or rather, just buy a different better game. (Unless your one of those people who like anything to do with Japan regardless of quality or value for money, in which case this is the game for you!)   BUT ITS JAPANESE SO I GUESS 10/10",

You can also create your own fighting style or weapon to suit your personal taste. Styles include dual wielding, spear wielding, ninja styles, and duel ninja styles. You can even use a pistol or rifle.   The combat itself is easy to jump into and difficult to master. The learning curve isnt very steep compared to most fighting games, so if you (like me) arn't usually a fighting game player, then you can still hop in and have a good time.   - Role Playing -  Few games make me feel like my actions are directly influencing the outcome of the story like sam4. The game is meant to be played multiple times and offers 10 different endings. There are even some hidden events and missions that are well worth finding.    Although the game itself can be overwhelming early on, if you like fighting games, role playing, or are intrested in feudal japan, then there's no game i can recommend more.

The character customisation has just enough options available to the player, only complaint is the accessory limit could be higher but you can still cram loads onto your character.    Difficulty in WotS4 is something you should aim to work your way up in, starting on easy usually and with the skills and weapons gained through your first playthrough you can work your way up to normal, then hard, and finally Harakiri. One shot kills gets increasingly common and strategic use of styles is required to counter this. Large fights can feel like endurance tests with momentary lapses in concentration being punished with one shot kills.   Overall I loved this game so much and played it in excessive amounts until I had finished almost everything, I plan to come back to it again later and finish the few things I've missed and master all the styles.

Why are we friends?' as the multiple cutscenes don't always fuse together as flawlessly as they should.  So what's the lure for new players? Despite all these flaws, it's just dang fun. Like previous installments, the game doesn't take itself too serious and its best the player doesn't either. While it doesn't get to the level of absurdity of 'Way of the Samurai 3', (don't deny it. You bowed to the kitty cats) it does offer a good fair share of quirky characters and odd circumstances. The short length of the game might be a deterrant at first, but it's a good game mechanic overall. When one wrong choice at the wrong time can effect the entire game and prevent certain endings, it was wise for the game developers to keep it short rather than letting players rip their hair out, wondering where they went wrong. And unlike some games, (looking at you Mass Effect 3), every choice really does effect the outcome.  For veterans of the series, there are some new features I enjoy. I love the new set up for styles. I also like the customization and how they removed a lot of the things that made doing side missions annoying.",
