            "review_text": "Okay, seriously, this is a new low. And I'm not talking about performance issues (which are horrific), I'm not talking about DRM, microtransactions and all other stuff. I'm not even infuriated about the lack of english language in my regional version. Well, I am, sort of, but only because the pre-order clearly stated that all languages are included. And suddenly after the purchase it isn't, and few hours later store page is updated to reflect this issue.  THIS. IS. ♥♥♥♥ING. FRAUD.   Update  ====== So I've been trying to resolve this with technical support of Ubi since release, aaaaand… you guessed right! Basically, their answer is: “You can go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, we took your money, we owe you nothing”. Additionally I must mention that support took their time responding. After first response: “We can't help you, go talk to Valve” and me catching them on their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (publisher admins store page, not Valve) they waited WHOLE MONTH (even more, 34 days to be exact) to just copy-pase another “We can't help you, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself”. It really amuses me. The price of changing one digital copy for another for a company is a ♥♥♥♥ing ZERO. Yet their support wastes time writing meaningless ♥♥♥♥. And worst of all: there is no other channel of communication. No phone number, no address (though they have regional office, but it's super-duper secret, so I can't even make a complaint about their horrible support). You know what, Ubi? I've had enough of your ♥♥♥♥. I will never ever pay even a single cent for you game, no matter how good it will be. Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself — that's my answer. I was a loyal customer for years, I've tolerated your lazy development, bugs and stuff. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me and saying it's raining? You must be really delusional to think you're doing good job. More importanly I will tell every person I know, every friend, every fellow online, when it comes to any of Ubi games, and the person wants to know whether it's good, should he buy it; my answer will be short: Hell no.",

            "review_text": "Reaction to this game has been laughable. I guess most people need to brush up on their French history and world history for that matter. First off, I find it silly that I have to explain that the world wasn't in 1080p until 1962, but that must be before your time. Though Unity often dips below 20 fps, this is generous for the time period, as France was one of the last countries to hit 240hz and operated at an unsteady 15-20fps throughout the 18th century. Unity surprised me by accurately showing Arno dropping through the ground and into the white abyss that exists under the real Paris, even to this day. Finally, there is the non-issue of pop-in... Anyone that has been to Paris is quite aware that parisians are all British accented phantoms that often come and go between planes of many dimensions.  Open a history book! Do more traveling! This is Ubisoft's finest work yet and I am glad to have had the opportunity to play it this soon before the actual release in 2017. The game is pretty far along for being this early in the development process.",

            "review_text": "I beat the game, and wrote a pretty popular review on Black Flag. I also work in QA, and love AC, and Ubisoft which I have a couple friends at. That being said, I would like to explain in detail and reason, as to why I would not recommend this game.  Yes the game is filled with performance issues, that I would like to believe Ubisoft would be able to fix with time, at current the game is barely playable, it does not run at the framerate it should and staggers a lot on any graphical setting, plus has rendering issues.  But the main arguments is how different this game feels from the rest of the series.   Eagle Eye.  On Black Flag and previous titles, Eagle Eye worked as a Stealth Tool, you could not RUN while it was activated and it highlighted things for you for a short period of time.  This time, Eagle Eye can be activated while running, and even mid combat, how ever it has a Cooldown. Which is a bit off putting. Specially when the highlight colors for Eagle Eye on Unity is also the brightest shade of RED and YELLOW I have ever seen. It actually bothers having highlighted targets during Combat, which occasionaly it may occur.   Combat.  The Combat in AC Series used to kinda fit the series. Everyone in Assassin's Creed regardless of how nuts, powerful, skillful or influential is a human. Which means they can be killed by Blades and Daggers. So it was awesome and pretty iconic to stop a Super Villain's monologue mid sentence with Hidden Blades from Above. How ever now, there is even a QTE Fight against a guy, and the use of an Eden Artifact as an excuse to 'Do it again three times' typical video game ness. Even Jobbers in Unity have way more health, and cannot be killed with a single Counter, which again made sense since it's a bunch of guards fighting an ASSASSIN, and you could up the challenge a bit by adding tons of guards that you had to time each counter to. Assassin's Creed is a cinematic experience, I do not want to fight some random guards for precious minutes cause they somehow are able to Tank an Assassin.  Equipment.  Another thing about this game, you could always get different gear and stuff, some with stats too. But you never REQUIRED to upgrade your stuff. I beat most of Black Flag with default gear cause they looked neat, and felt part of the character. This time how ever it is a huge challenge to beat the game with default gear 'Which I did, cause the rest looked ugly' since there's an RPG element to the game, where you have a 'Level' for your character and each Jobber and missions too. And how ever you are able to play the missions they simply have more health, or you perhaps are not 'As Stealthy' cause your 'Stealth Stats' were not high enough.   Stealth.  And stealth also has it's issues, they made a lot of things look and feel different, even the Blending on groups of civs has a different type of visual to it, and is not as effective if you do not have enough 'Stealth Stats' from your gear. Still works till the end of the game, but it's clearly dependent of these upgrades.   City.  The City is amazing, is the one part of this game that needs proper credit. The amount of NPCs on the screen is ridiculous. And gives the city an incredible detail and Life. The Revolution is displayed very well too.   Co Op.  I have not yet been able to try Co Op much since friends were not able to play or playing on PS4. But as far as I see you have some neat options for creating your own Club, and having challenges, objectives. Form your own Creed. And meet other Assassins. There are a few options for different types of activities for your Co Op friends. And exploring the city with friends sounds amazing.  Story.  The story is pretty interesting, I don't see major flaws with it aside from not explaining the Eden Artifact used on this game AT ALL. Characters are pretty interesting, but they are barely used as to their extent.  Overall, there are a lot of glitches, lack of the Hidden Blade rendering during ingame cutscenes that shows the character stabbing a dude, even tents that have 100% visibility through it getting guards to detect you through it. Lot's of QA issues, and for what ever reason they decided to mess with a bunch of mechanics that already worked in the first place. Eagle Eye, Stealth, Combat. I feel like people ♥♥♥♥♥ed at how easy it was to fight in previous AC games and they tried to please those dudes, but Combat always made SENSE and it was cinematic.  I also believe this game might be pretty 'Skipable', in terms of what it adds to the overall plot and the characters on it.",

            "review_text": "Update: Unity lowered the bar to such a point that almost all the positive comments recommend the game because IT CAN RUN. The sympathy for the game is bordering Stockholm Syndrome. It is praised for doing what exactly every single game should be able to do: execute. It’s almost brilliant and a great business model, too: 1) Release a game with no content that cannot run. 2) Fix all the bugs. 3) Profit.  First of all Unity is actually a decent game but since this is supposed to be a part of the Assassin’s Creed storyline, it miserably fails to fit in, hence the vote down.  Secondly, of course, spoilers.  The overall feel of Unity is more like a fan fiction project with an enormous budget rather than a proper, canonical installment.  I think the most important thing that I would have liked to know before buying Unity is this: It has  NO ADVANCE IN THE MODERN DAY STORY ARC . Apart from the occasional server change ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (which I think is a lazy excuse to include the Eiffel Tower in the game) there is nothing happening today.  Honestly I gave up on expecting any good story material after playing AC3, because the compelling and coherent story of the first civilization and their artifacts that will help prevent the 2012 apocalypse ended with Desmond. The story as it was revealed up to that point didn’t require the juno plot twist to be any better.  In Black Flag the sages were introduced, which were only conceptually replacing the artifacts. But I still had no problem with it, because the reason I play the games is the beautifully complex story that actually takes place today, which has layers and layers of narration embedded in each other. Like the way the game used to be about the modern day assassin Desmond, living Ezio’s life, who has visions of Altair and the way these characters are interconnected centuries apart (the last speech of Ezio in Masyaf).  But the good side is that you do not have to be annoyed about not being able to replay modern day missions, since there are none.  Maybe I’m mistaken but I remember an interview, explaining this initiate thing to be a way of supporting the immersion of the game play, that the player would indeed feel like the person who is actually in the animus. Well, it does not. and I do not. When there was this confused, interacting, afraid deep within and overall relatable Desmond, I cared about his story. His layer of narration was the buffer between the animus and the actual game. His presence was a mental bridge; he was there to suggest the mode of interaction and how to feel. Now that the game has no modern day content, no outer layer of narration that I can relate to and is based on a complete rehash of the finding artifacts plot with the one key difference that there is no cataclysmic end game like the DESTRUCTION OF THE EARTH, it is reduced to some kind of assassination simulation.  As it is stated by many other players, now the fighting is much, much better. It is more realistic that you can’t take 30 people at once.  Unless you use the smoke bomb generously.  I was one of the people who thought the fighting should be more challenging and I actually liked this improvement at first, but the fact that it is easily overcome by buying powerful enough gear and smoke bombs, does not make me believe that this is a genuine attempt to make it realistic, but rather a way to make players grind points, or much better, buy helix points to upgrade. The new fighting mechanism doesn’t require skill, it requires points. At some point, I ended up running into lifts like an idiot to collect extra creed points for a sword. There are nice improvements but all of them feel contrived.  Plus, since with enough smoke bombs, skill and gear the fighting is exactly the same, the only difference now is that you don’t see a damn thing through the shroud of the smoke while fighting. Or you can activate the eagle sense, of course, so now you’re fighting luminescent, solid colored bald figures.  Unity adds nothing to the main story arc and everything in the game is a rehash of an old concept, without proper justification (unless you count being cool as a legitimate reason). I could completely skip this installment and I wouldn’t miss anything story-wise:  Like Arno owning the Cafe Theatre is analogous of Ezio owning a town. But, well, Ezio is a ♥♥♥♥ing landlord! Why does the Assassin Brotherhood just give away the entire income of a huge cafe to this one seemingly insignificant new recruit?  What is the proper justification of the ancients devising a lightning sword, which is analogous of the apples and the shroud, that teleports to undefined distances? The apples and the shroud that was always there at every turning point of human history, as opposed to the sword which is there as a nice gimmick and an end game reward.  Why nobody is freaking over the existence of such sword and looking for it, instead of looking for the body of a man, who was explained to be an identical genetic copy of another man with the identical set of memories, who was already captured dead in the previous title?  Seriously, where is that sword? Doesn’t the existence of such an artifact implies an additional title on Arno, where the modern day Assassins try and find the sword before the evil reverse engineers of Abstergo?  Where did this Desmond-replacement, unnamed initiate come from? Desmond was held captive by Abstergo and later rescued by the Assassins. Why is this person agreeing a possible lobotomy and why should I relate myself to such an immaterial idiot? The stakes were real in the story for Desmond, because he was there in flesh and bone. And really, in AC:R, his consciousness was [able to get] trapped in the animus, since he was introduced as a separate character (and a plot device) than the actual player. Since the initiate is an avatar of the player, We know that there is no risk of brain damage that will change the course of the modern day story, thus anything Shaun says is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to make the game sound cool.  What happened to the bleeding effect? Is the initiate being trained now? For what? Or is this an upgraded animus that doesn’t cause the bleeding effect? If so, then, is it actually a downgrade?  What is the deal with Arno’s eagle sense? Why are they making up new, ambiguous powers as they go along? When was the “super smelling” power introduced? Why Arno and no one else has the power of sharing consciousness with a dying person? If the eagle sense was a genetic trait coming down from the first civilization as explained in previous games, isn’t it supposed to be more powerful as you go backward in the inheritance tree and not other way around?  Why is everyone British? Of course they will have some accent after all, but why such a distinctive one? Just because there are palaces and it is Europe? With the nasal sounding butler and other characters, saying pretentious ♥♥♥♥ like “*rse” or “myes sire”?  If the entire Helix and Abstergo Entertainment subplot is their new immersion trick, how am I supposed to feel immersed while being asked to pay actual money for upgrades?  Why is Ubisoft doing this to the franchise?  So all in all, if you are a loyal fan of the series, you’ll disregard all the negative comments, including this one and play the game anyway. That’s what I did, because I was curious about the progress in the main story arc, which turned out to be nonexistent.  If you are new to the series, please do yourself a favour and go start from Ezio’s story. Assassin’s Creed Unity is the single most beautiful Nvidia showreel I have ever seen and nothing more.  The game of course had its few moments, which I will not spoil, the graphics were gorgeous and the soundtrack was the best so far (bar the Revelations main theme). But I could be completely fine with watching few scenes online and listening to the soundtrack of “Tous les matins du monde” instead.",

            "review_text": "I actually really like Assassin's Creed Unity. It's nothing new in relative to the rest of the series. Very similar formula to the games preceding it not counting Black Flag. Graphically, it looks very impressive and the new parkour and animation system system is something I consider to be a vast improvement to all other games in the series. The story is pretty bland which is a shame because playing it you can tell that it want's to be good but can't quite muster it. Ubisoft has filled the world fun little sidequests and collectables for you to nab ranging from tedious to geniunely interesting or fun. The customization is alright but it is hampered by the fact that Ubisoft thought it was a good idea to lock at least half of it until they decide to release a multiplayer game mode. It also suffers from collectables that are locked unless you have access to the companion app, which is just stupid. Not to mention their clearly forced in microtransactions that they must have tossed in there in the last five minutes. I will say that Ubisoft does not force anyone to buy these microtransactions as within 6 to 8 hours of playing you can accumulate a pretty substantial in-game fortune. While I do have these grievances with the game I would like to reiterate that I do actually enjoy it. I want to play it. But Ubisoft's broken release is actually now preventing me launching the game at all. I played for a good few hours with no glitches apparent, but then it started with the frame drops which I can't stand. So I stopped playing for several days only to hop back on today and find that the frame drops had disappeared. Then just an hour ago, I decided that I would play some more, but I was hit the ACUnity.exe has stopped working, and after trying all available fixes I have given up. It would be a crime to recommend the game in it's current state to others. The reason I am writing this review is because Ubisoft can't provide me with the product that I stupidly paid for. So instead, this time that should be spent enjoying my purchase is being used writing this review in hopes that I may deter at least one person from spending money on this product in it's current build so that they may not have to suffer my fate.",

There is more emphasis on stealth, so it's finally an actual assassin game! Now let's go to the bad part, which is low frame rate and frame drops. One segment in the game I would have a solid 40-50 fps, and in the next sequence I would only get like 20 even though the scenary is still the same. The other problem with the game is the frame drops. Every few seconds, you would get a quick frame delay that makes you change your movement direction and pretty much messes up your entire gameplay expierence.   Now let's go on to the wonderful city of paris, which must be my new favorite game setting. The developers of AC: Unity made a beautiful and realistic looking city. It feels very realistic due to the little details that they added everywhere. One thing that makes the city look alive is the people. They are always moving and waving their flags, talking to each other, or stealing/insulting others. The problem with that though is I think it's partially the reason why the game lags because it requires intense CPU usage to process all those movements and characters, even though Ubisoft said that the number of people on screen dosen't affect frame rates at all, but that is something must people are calling B.S.  If the patches are going to fix the stutter and fram issues, I would rate this game a solid 9/10 and it would be my new favorite Assassin's creed game. However, in it's current state, giving it a 6/10 is a little generous of me. I would only reccomend buying the game when the game is actually patched.   I currently do not reccomend the game but when, hopefully, frame rate issues are fixed, i'm going to change to a reccomendation because the game is pretty fun.",

Paris has been lovingly recreated with a 1:1 scale, meaning when you walk up to or climb buildings they look massive and the same proportions as in real life, that makes a big difference from past Creed games.  Graphically it looks superb with everything maxed out and you can tell Ubisoft put most of their effort into making the actual city in painstaking detail. The amount of NPC'S in this is insane as well, usually open world games have far fewer people walking around the streets than you would expect. This goes the complete opposite direction, there is one mission where there are literally thousands of people you have to navigate through to find the target you need to assassinate.  This is however also what f*cked up the game and breaks the immersion for you as a player. Ubisoft hasn't managed to eliminate the bugs of NPC'S appearing and disappearing in front of you, and some characters still swap their clothes at will. I can't stress how bad this is in the game, because there are always large crowds of people on the streets it happens CONSTANTLY and was really distracting to me. I eventually was able to ignore it after about 10 hours, but by that time i was just trying to finish the story missions.  The game also still doesn't run that well because of (i assume) the large crowds of people. I would get between 40 to 60 fps with the settings all maxed out, and my pc is pretty good.  There actually is a f*ckton of side content to do, but the few side missions i tried were rubbish. There are these new detective murder mystery missions you can solve where you have to talk to people and accuse the right person who you think did it. At the start of this it warned me not to accuse just anyone and to be sure of who i thought it was, so i thought that all the evidence pointing to the guy who obviously did it was a misdirection by one of the characters planting the evidence on the guy.......but no it actually is the guy you think it is, so it's rubbish lol i didn't bother with the other murder mysteries.  I tried co op but the one time it worked for me the guy immediately left, so good luck finding people to play with.  Story wise it's okay i guess, although there weren't really any stand out missions that took me by surprise like in Rogue, also all the characters speak with an english accent.........in FRANCE lol, i was thinking about this and it's either have the voice actors speak with a sh*tty french accent like Joseph Gordon Levitt in The Walk and give the game some charm, or do what they did and not even try.  If you like Assassins Creed games and have a fairly powerful PC i would cautiously recommend this, the only bugs i witnessed were cosmetic, the game never crashed on me or had bugged missions like some past Creed games i've played. It's a shame Ubisoft fell at the last hurdle because the game does a lot of things well, it's just that the things it does wrong are so consistent that it ruins a big part of the experience.",

The frame rate is awful (which makes picklocking much harder than it needs to be), I've gotten stuck in hay baskets, fallen into buildings or just through the ground altogether, and even lost items that I had already unlocked. In addition, there are chests everywhere you can't open unless you download their stupid app and play it a bunch (and the app is awful). THEN they also have in game currency that you can BUY with real money called Hack (up to $99 worth. Seriously?). And don't even get me started on Co-Op. Connection is terrible, host migration takes forever, and gameplay wise, it's difficult to properly communicate with teammates. You are limited to targeting something (mind, you can't REMOVE a target once you set one, so at some point there are just targets everywhere) and a 'Let's go' command. I can't tell my teammates to throw a cherry bomb, or use their phantom blade, or tell person A to go there and person B to go somewhere else, or even tell them what I'M going to be doing. The whole thing just ends up being a big mess as you try to predict what your teammates are going to be doing. I honestly end up treating co-op missions like solo missions, paying little attention to what my teammates are doing and not working with them at all.   As far as things the game does RIGHT, I can say that the story is...ALRIGHT. It's not fantastic but it's not bad either. I like the changes to combat. Instead of couter attacks you have parry, which will render the enemy defensless for a short period of time, rather than just instantly killing them as you string together counter attack after counter attack like pervious games. It goes really well with Co-op, because with 2-4 people you'd consider just charging into an army and taking them on. However, with combat more challenging (and guns nearly one shotting you with basic armor) it makes you think twice about your strategy. They brought back magic medicine which heals all your health at the push of a button which I actually don't like at all. I liked health rejen out of combat much better because then I could get in little fights all around town and if I got hit once or twice it didn't matter much. But now, I'd have to use medicine after every little fight to keep my health up. I also like the skill system. In co-op it lets each player bring somethign different to the table. One guy might have lots of health and melee skills, another might have ranged skills, and the last two have stealthy skills. It spices up the gameplay nicely. (ALSO I REALLY LIKE THAT YOU CAN HAVE A RIFLE AS A WEAPON. JUST FREAKING SMACK PEOPLE WITH A RIFLE. SWORDS? TOO EASY. BULLETS? THOSE ARE FOR SCRUBS. JUST BASH THEIR FACES IN WITH IT)  Overall, I would NOT recommend this game at this point in time. MAYBE when they fix frame rate issues (I know I didn't talk about this a lot but believe me, IT'S A BIG ISSUE), and the various bugs the plague the game get sorted out my opinion might change. I realize the game hasn't been out long but that is NO excuse for all these issues. When you release something, it should be as perfect as possible. I understand they can't catch every little bug but this is just unexcusable.",

My expectations for this game was not high at all, in fact the only reason I bought this game was because of Rogue which was for me, one of the best ac games hands down. But we are talking about unity so I'll stop praising that game for now.  The French revolution is such an interesting part of history and I wished unity would've interracted more with it - for me, the story was good, but not as extrodinary as it could've been. I wished there were more interraction with the residents and a bit more with the historical characters - but tbh the scenes that we got was pretty entertaining. When it comes to gameplay I have to say I miss the old interface that was in ac4 and rogue. I got ofc used to the new one but for some reason I miss the little 'sync wheel' at the end of each mission lmao   Other than that the controls was a good change I think, but it felt very clumsy using them - there were several times where Arno got stuck on a wall and would not go up and times where he did'nt want to jump down - and again that can be me at fault, you see, I suck at video games ... or it could've been a bug 'cause you know, unity isn't exactly bug-free (at least they've fixed A LOT, I only experienced like three minor bugs which wasn't a big deal for me) But don't get me wrong, the little change in the game's parkour is A+  More good things - the multiplayer concept was a very cool thing I enjoy it a lot and will probably play this game more later with friends. The upgrading system was cool too, even though I cringed hard at the micro transactions they've added in the game.   If this game is on sale then I truly recommend it cause it's not that bad. I enjoyed it.  In the end I just want to give a huge '♥♥♥♥ you' to all those guns each stupid policeman and guard had. Seriously, they can't get more OP than that",

            "review_text": "I think the new engine did the game good. It feels fresher. It's not inventing much new (I still need to try co-op) but when coming from Black Flag and Rogue you'll appreciate what it does.   It has no sailing and ship combat (love it or hate it) but consists mostly of Paris and some other smaller towns/palaces. In pure miles to travel I guess Unity is inferior to BL/Rogue but it makes up with love of detail and by using the space available to bigger extend. Most notably there are plenty indoors area now being used for missions, to contain collectibles or as means of moving across streets/lines of buildings more quickly (hopping into one window and leaving through the opposite one).  Even when recognizing certain reused assets over the time Paris feels diverse and lively. This game having more civilians on the streets than any AC before adds to it. Every nook and cranny feels kind of unique, often featuring landmarks with historical buildings or places and brimming with life, at best illuminated into a gorgeous sunset making use of fancy post-processing effects. I think this is the first AC where I actually enjoyed moving on ground level more than via the rooftops only thanks to the many more details that are naturally to be found 'down below'. For the first time I also bothered to consequently read the associated database/mini-encyclopedia - and immediately after having unlocked entries about places, people or historic events at the time. It helps with immersion and to grow interest for the city. Even after I will drop the game (which can still take a while) I can already see myself going on a Google/Wikipedia travel vacation with all the screenshots I took and comparing how Paris, characters and events are shown in the game and how they really looked or worked out back then and how they do now.  Reading the database entries, newspapers (there are two, and each year that passes in the story timeline spawns a new issue to read from around places with a couple random stories about the events of that year) or paying attention to details generally is advised. The storyline is following along historic events from around 1788 to 1794 or so (I haven't fully finished it yet but I'm close) and sometimes makes sudden leaps of numerous months up to a year you wouldn't notice if it weren't for previously acquired historic knowledge and the occasional time 'stamps' in the introductory memories of each sequence.  This leads to my gripe with the game or series as a whole: I miss the present-time storyline. Here it is hardly advanced at all. I stopped hoping for anything new ever since Black Flag. More so important is the past-time story. That one isn't bad but not necessarily surprising either. I feel more engaged than in Rogue, the characters are more likeable and tangible, I particularly like the relationship between Arno and Élise even if it didn't get as much display as it could've deserved earlier on. You are back to certain roots like having a proper Assassin brotherhood to work for, a council to report to, you get a real initiation and the three tenets I had forgotten some games back are recited. This is neatly incorporated into the co-op multiplayer which allows you to form clans with people ('brotherhoods') and to grow up in ranks (individually) or specify such (clan-related). Should people have felt displaced with AC3 and onward they will feel back home in ways with Unity, it is closer to the original game and the Ezio trilogy in many ways.  But: Things can be a little predictable. Following real historic events to some degree and having to maintain a certain balance of power for the present-time story to make sense always means a certain predictability. Some details might be considered plain fan service even. For example it was interesting to meet Napoleon but I have only seen him once and he was relatively irrelevant to the story so far. They could've left him out and it would've hardly made a difference, but I suppose when playing that time one would just expect or hope to have his appearance (regardless of whether he was indeed in real-life where the game shows him to be when you meet him or not, which I don't know). In this manner I can easily see others to roll their eyes a little at this game or the series generally. Even so there was/is boldness in recreating historic settings as well as it does and this is is a game with great love of detail and you can tell the developers put lots of effort into making Paris feel and look as great as they could.  I'm wondering how a non-open world game would fare in comparison. I think I observe that certain groups of civilians in front of historic buildings always stay the same over the years that pass story-wise. There might also be some inconsistencies with how buildings actually looked in-between in the real-life and how they do in the game. For example whether the Bastille was already damaged before you play the mission that sees it stormed. Or whether a certain bridge was built with the Bastille's stones while it was still intact (it was completely taken apart by the Revolutionaries if I understand correctly, so both couldn't exist at the same time but they do in the game). Or if the small noon-cannon in the Palais-Royal actually fires at noon as it seems to do in real-life. Even if I'm just mistaken I guess a more 'enclosed' kind of game could deal with these details more consistently and faithful to the facts. But this isn't meant as a negative, I'm just wondering, I bet most players never paid nearly enough attention to any of this so in the end it won't matter.  These are details one could divulge himself with for more and more hours to come, and I'm kind of curious. Not sure if I'll examine them as much but there sure is a lot one can do with this even after having completed the game a longer while back. This should be appreciated too if I'm to be asked, there is a deep value in it by itself beyond being a game simply. It's sad that all this is a bit looked over in the series generally (I myself learned my lesson late, I feel inclined to properly re-read databases and stuff in the previous games now, I surely will pay more attention in the future titles) or in Unity due to the bumpy start it seemed to have had. The performance issues many seemed to have look fixed, at least on my rig the game runs smoothly, although maybe because I'm rather high-end and at the cost of detail. (The level of detail on buildings and such quickly deteriorates at a distance and characters are rendered during cutscenes with better quality than they actually look like when you're controlling stuff - but I'm also getting some harmless yet consistent graphical glitches that could be the engine, a faulty GPU, faulty drivers - having similar phenomena in other games speaks for this - or some such else so I don't know for sure if this is all supposed to look as I see it or not. It's still a great looking game overall.)  If I had to add some negatives: The A.I. can be very stupid. I uploaded one video showing an example of that. Something else includes you being able to assassinate targets in a row from around cover with your enemies literally running into it like lemmings. The combat can feel hard at first and you can get overwhelmed by too many guards but you can essentially still block/evade it all if you're quick enough and when you have enough smoke bombs (different gear you wear improves your capacities/abilities/stats) you can easily get rid of them all in a fairly easy manner. By unlocking advanced combat moves you can break any of their blocking abilities and cut them down without much of a sweat. In this manner the series continues to be lacking any great challenges although there are plenty of nice-ish riddles around that have you explore landmarks for hidden symbols with eagle vision. And the co-op content looks like beefed up on difficulty either although I haven't tried it enough to say for sure.",

While Assassin's Creed Unity's main story is far from being one of the best in the series, the game was still enjoyable for me at the very least. Having played through all of the Assassin's Creed games in their respective order, the enormous city of Paris with its high roof tops felt extremely nostalgic. I have spent hours free roaming because of how gorgeous the city is. The parkour is a bit different this time around. The controls do take a while to get used to and it can be a little frustrating at first, but once you get the hang of it, the majority of time it works well.   Unity, in my opinion, has some of the most interesting side missions ever introduced in the franchise. The Paris stories, Cafe and Co-op missions are very intriguing as they provide a lot of context for tackling your objectives. Muder Mystries and Enigmas on the other hand can be quite entertaining if you're in the mood for some problem solving. But what truly makes Unity different from all other Assassin's Creed games however, is the sheer amount of customization. It is extremely satisfying and rewarding when you're finally able to unlock the gears and skills you've wanted after playing the game for a period of time.  All in all, this game is definitely worth a shot if you're a fan of the series. If not, you should try it when it's on sale. The immense amount of content will be well worth the price.",

Call of Duty you are going to have a gun and go shoot people. That is what we enjoy about the games. Odds are if you enjoyed the other games in the series you will enjoy this one.

The story, I must admit, is rather lackluster compared to previous games' series of events. Although it is another revolution, Arno, the main character, plays a bit of a much more laidback role in the French Revolution compared to how Connor essentially did everything for the American Revolution. The love story between Arno and Elise is a nice touch, and rather hearfelt at times. The combat is somewhat more difficult to get to used to than the more recent past installments, but still enjoyable. Overall, this game is pretty damn good after the patches. My only true beef with this game is the minimum requirements list as I had a GTX 660 when I bought the game, thinking that I could run it smoothly on the lowest settings.

The mobs of angry civilians, the thugs beating upon the innocents, and the chatter in French which I am guessing is about whose mother baked who a crepe. The lighting in the game makes you appreciates the city of Paris with even more fervor. Free-running has become more fluid than ever before, however not without a few falls and missteps of course. Free running can aggravate me at times and the overall story is lackluster in bringing anything new to the franchise (so far). If you are like me and can immerse yourself in an open-world game, get this game. I have had very few bugs (which correlate to the sometimes janky free-running and batty A.I). If you are hoping that Unity will push the boundaries, try new game mechanics, and revamp their previous system from Black Flag, maybe hold on until the next Steam Sale.

Patch 4 made things a little smoother, but nowhere near what it should be.   What gets me more upset is that there is literally no story to this game. Ubisoft took a caracter vaguely like Ezio, threw him into the Assassin group in a revenge quest...and that's it. He never actually believes anything the assassins believe in, nobody even really tells him about that in fact. They just say, Templars=bad, now go kill them.   In the process of 'streamlining' the mechanics, you can no longer whistle to attract enemies. Here is a list of everything that you have to BUY with in game points to be able to do:   Double assassinations   Double air assassinations    Ground executions   Dropping money to attract crowds   Lockpicking skill (which is really bad AND has 3 levels you need to buy btw)   Environmental Blending   Health Upgrades   More attacks for EACH weapon type separately    Other bomb types   Now some of these features used to take crafting or searching for things into it which I'm fine with, but using a point system that you only have a limited number to work with unless you play tons of multiplayer is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It takes abilities that were either built into past characters from the moment they start or taught to them or given for free in the story and makes you choose which you want to spend your 'Sync Points' on. In order to get enough of these points you MUST play the broken multiplayer that I never got to work successfully. It would load a match then disconnect immediately.

The combat in Unity is challenging, but rewarding. For the most part - agile guards are absurdly so, being able to block all normal attacks and dodge bullets at point blank range.  World Exploration? Mixed. You get to find various chests and secret riddles. The problem is the system which the game employs to open chests. It's a minigame where the cursor speeds from top to bottom and you need to press a key at the right moment. I've played a lot of games, but this is easily the worst lockpicking system i;ve ever seen. Over time you get better at it (hopefully) and you can get gear to increase the ammount of lockpicks you can carry but the system is very stupid and very frustrating. As an added stupidity, chests are divided into three tiers. Each tier requires a skill and each of these is only unlocked as you progress into the game. The third is only unlocked about 3/4ths into the game, meaning that you can only freely explore the game world then.  Characters. Again mixed. The main duo; Arno and his love interest, Elise are reasonably well written and fun to watch. But the others... Well there's not many others. We get a few main npcs but these appear fairly rare and although they're not hopelessly shallow, they still lack something - chances are you'll remember them. And you won't be missing much. Although Napoleon is awesome.  Main story. Weak. Not bad, mind you. But definitely weak. After Black Flag i was expecting more from AC. The sequences themselves are very much uneqal. Some are thrilling and fun to play, but others (and this is a lot of them) are just boring. It also has to be said that the events of the plot are predictable almost to the point of it being absurd. You'll probably see a lot of them coming from a mile away. Especially the ending, whch is really quite stupid.  Side missions and activities. Varied again. To give the game credit, a lot of the side stories are interesting although not challening (until the end where the challenge is created by stacking thirty guards in one place). But the other things you do in the game are bland. You no longer have assasinations. What you have is sad remnants of a now defunct game companion app (no longer needed) You do however get murder mysteries, where you find a body and try to find the killer.  So to sum up. What's good and what's bad about this game? The Good: -Arno and Elise are charming -the game has improved graphics and improved combat mechanics -Unity offers far more gametime than any previous AC game (i got 100h out of it, not couning the free dead kings dlc) -the new co-op system  The Bad -No Revolution - despite what the trailers claim you don't actually get to interact with the events of the revolution. It all just happens off-stage. The quests have next to nothing to do with the revolution. -The game still has visible scars from the companion app and some other now-defunc things.  -The story is weak. -The world feels empty and its exploration is arbitrarily halted by the lockpicking -The world also failed (at least for me) to make me feel the setting and the time period in the same way as the previous AC games have -the lockpicking - very stupid, very annoying - on par with a bad flash game, not a fourty euro mainstream game  So who is this game for? It's hard to say. If you want a casual AC with better combat, then you may well like it. If you're an Assassins Creed fan, then you'll like the game too - an okay part of the series, if not anything special. BUT, if you want a good plot, then you might want to pick up Black Flag or Rogue. AND if you want a game about the French Revolution (maybe after listening to Les Miserables) then this is definitelly not it.",

Second quarter; running smoothly after messing around a bit.  Third quarter; messing up a little... But still, for the most part, playable.  Fourth quarter; crashes twice during final boss; once mid-fight, once during ending cutscene.  Post-story; CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT STUTTERING. I try to load a mission, it crashes. I try to customize my character... Crash. I run around aimlessly trying to find other stuff to do; stutter, freeze, crash.  Storywise, I LOVE AC Unity, and don't see why people hate it.  Gameplay Ideas, I love, and find absolutely genius and incredible.  Technicalwise, I want to burn this game. Not onto a disc... In a FIRE.  On the XBOX One (from what I've played), it's great.

Since the last review I've upgraded to a GTX 960 4GB and it's now tolerable to play. Not great, but workable. And fun. This is miles above AC3. I haven't been able to touch the multiplayer, so I've no idea how the co-op works, but I'm enjoying the rest. It feels like it's taken several long strides from Black Flag back to AC1, which I'm all for. I liked the combat and mechanics of 1.  But the 'Mixed' user review speaks for itself. You'll either enjoy it or want to tear it's code apart. Ironic how the game that divided the fanbase it called 'Unity.'  So even though I'm enjoying it, I still can't recommend. It's trash.

However, there are so many design flaws and bugs, and ridiculous time sinks... just.. don't bother.   I've had multiple instances where Arno gets trapped in mid air with a falling animation or stuck peering over a ledge and being unable to move. The combat with heavy weapons is sluggish and sometimes you get animation locked watching an enemy fall over instead of being able to move on to the next one. I've even had the leading red haired female get stuck in place in one mission and refuse to let me continue to escort her. I won't even get into how stupid it is that debris like paper and fruit and other stupid things like that will hang in mid air with nothing to prop them up. The parkour is a little better with the up and down controls.. but half the time Arno will not listen to the players commands and do his own things.. like refusing to grab an easy close-by ledge... or refusing to go into a window. It gets frustratingly annoying very quickly.  The missions don't prepare you in any way for what the 'Full Sync' task will be, and often will lock you in the mission being unable to return to free roam mode so you can buy the skill you need from doing co-op. And that's another thing... the game forces you to play co-op in order to get enough skill points to buy unlocks to get full sync in single player missions! Going back to locking you in missions though, the free dlc you get with the game opens up in sequence 5, and the dlc is sequence 13. If you happen to click the dlc, which is RIGHT BESIDE your home structure to go collect your money, you get shoved into the sequence 13 DLC and are unable to leave until you finish sequence 13 part 1. While the videos you see only provide minor spoilers, there are still things you can easily discern if you really think about it that will spoil bits of the main story.  On top of all it's design faults, there are so many stupid collectables padding the game time in this game that a very sizable fraction of my game time (Above 50%) has just gone to looting chests with only money inside. And once you have your 7 pieces of maxed out gear you have no point in having money at all!  Also, there are microtransactions in a single player game. 'Helix points' are used to upgrade gear, or buy it early, or used to unlock maps to all the treasure and side quest locations in the game for real life money. I don't think I even need to state how greedy that is.   If you buy this game, buy it on sale and only play the main storyline and don't even worry about the full syncs. You'll get a pretty decent story and less of a headache as a result. It hurt's to say that because I'm a huge AC fanboy, and it's so sad to see how this panned out.",

The game was gorgeous, fun to play, and really took the AC franchise to the next level. Rather than rehashing the same old mechanics and game infrastructure - they took the time to recreate this game for the Next Gen from the ground up - and it shows. I would absolutely recommend this game.  When I booted this little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ up, I was skeptical. From the reviews, I expected the worst game of the series. I was concerned that the AC series had run its course. I was very happily mistaken.  From my very first minute in-game until now, I am blown away by the game - both its improvements, and what they've kept.  Graphically, this game is astounding. Climbing atop a roof in Paris for the first time and seeing the sun glinting off beautifully rendered Parisian rooftops as my cloak flowed realistically behind me, I realized I was playing a piece of art.   Controls-wise, this game is 70% improvement, 30% regression. The control scheme has been tweaked to give the player more control over where he/she goes, and how. You can now very easily parkour your way DOWN, something new in this series, and it really improves the gameplay. I did experience a bit of non-responsiveness and some glitching which could be annoying, but it wasn't nearly frequent enough to impact my enjoyment of the game.  Story, loved it. I've seen some bad reviews of this game's story, and I'm not sure why. I thought the characters were interested and well developed. I noticed growth and character development as the story progressed, and I felt connected to the characters, and affected by their tragedies. We also got the first real peak into the culture and inner workings of the Brotherhood since AC1, which I really loved.  ",

Obviously if you're a series fan you're going to play it anyway but for those with a more casual interest? Skip this chapter, you can find something else to sink 60 - 90 hours into.  I won't babble on about the horrid launch or how technical issues plagued the game for the first couple months - that's in the past and most serious issues have been ironed out. At this point, its current state is the best you're going to get and as long as you've got the hardware you should be ok.  I also won't go on about how much the Companion App/Initiates and the locking of gear behind Co-op missions was a questionable and down-right annoying choice. That's pretty clear as it is.   However what I will emphasize as being the biggest flaw of Unity is its complete lack of focus on what matters. Assassin's Creed 3 started a trend that has become more and more chaotic as the franchise has gone on. What am I referring to? Collectibles, side missions, and other distractions. While it's true that more-or-less every Assassin's Creed game has featured these elements, before AC 3 they were done in moderation. The focus was firmly on the story - its events and characters. Treasure chests, eagle feathers, and Templar Knights were there for those that wanted achievements/trophies, and side missions were few and far between and usually expanded upon or branched off from the main story-line or were simple and fun (like the 'platforming' missions in Assassin's Creed 2).  Yet after Assassin's Creed 3 there was this significant push to fill the game-worlds with distracting extras. Suddenly we needed to collect hundreds of treasure chests and animus fragments, or carry out territory wars all over the place for a modest increase in our income. More and more the focus shifted from the stories these games wanted to tell and we found ourselves coming back to the next memory sequence with a hazy idea of what was happening and who these characters (both our own and the supporting cast) even were. This created a large disconnect between the player and the story/characters, suddenly Assassin's Creed was more about naval battles and treasure hunting and less about the timeless struggle between Templar and Assassin.  Unity takes this disconnect, this lack of focus, to all new heights. It wants us to pay attention, wants us to get invested in Arno and Elise's quest for revenge, the useless and static French Brotherhood, the Templar civil war, and how these play against the backdrop of Revolutionary France but then it throws distraction after distraction at you. 'Play Co-op!', 'Use the Companion App!', 'Play through our 50+ Paris Stories and Murder Mysteries!', 'Tackle theives and kill criminals hundreds of times for a reward!', 'Find that random treasure chest that unlocks that weapon/armor!', and so on and so on.  Simply put: Unity lacks focus and it pays the price for that. Unity will fatigue you, it will annoy you, it will frustrate you.   6 Phrygian Caps out of 10",

I will also say that the Templar-Assassin fiasco never ceases to enthrall me in the ageless, long-fought war between order and freedom.  My main gripe with Unity is that the main character, Arno Dorian, had so much untapped potential, and the writers of this game failed to take advantage of what could have been the next Ezio Auditore. I would liken Arno's story to ACII, where Ezio is just starting to become an Assassin. Their stories are similar, and yet Arno's story was shortened into one game, and his character was rather bland, providing no motivation towards relating to the character in any possible way.  I built my first PC to play this game. It was worth it.",

Although from reading and seeing some things online that made it obvious that it once was infested with a ton of bugs, either most or all of those bugs were evidently polished out; it was very rare for me to experience bug issues and when I did, they were pretty minor. The graphics were pretty damn good compared to every other AC games aside from the render distance being pretty terrible at times. It seems a lot of people complained about this game not running well on their PC, but honestly, just disable ambient occlusion and anti-aliasing and set everything else to either high or very high. My computer never dropped below 60 fps when I disabled these two options and I never noticed a difference in the visual quality from doing so. For those who may be interested, I'm using an i5 cpu with an nvidia geforce GTX 770, so my pc isn't exactly a super tank. With that aside, the main plot of the game was decent enough, the mechanics were smooth as hell and it felt great climbing and fighting, but I felt the stealth was quite unforgiving and it seemed like no matter what you did most of the time, you were eventually going to get caught because of there being a ♥♥♥♥ ton of guards that you can't kill without being spotted. I attempted to 100% this game, but I eventually gave up for two main reasons: some of the coop missions were batshit hard if you attempted them solo (which I much more prefer and which easily will be a requirement in the near future if it isn't already), and to unlock sight of all the collectibles, missions, etc. in the game, you don't just synchronize viewpoints anymore, you have to pay to unlock that sight with Helix points which at the beginning of the game you get so much of so you use it on useless ♥♥♥♥ and then you find out to 100% the game, you are required to have 600 of them to know where the hell everything is unless you want to buy more Helix points because microtransactions are too cool, guys. Either way, the campaign was interesting enough to keep me wanting to know more about what happens and the difficulty in combat was amped up by quite a bit, which I personally enjoyed. It actually gave you insentive to get really rich to get the best gear possible so that you can fight those higher level guards with more ease. One GIANT problem though with the combat: the snipers positioned on the roofs are overpowered as all hell. They shoot you without warning, are undodgeable, and you die in around 4-5 shots with the best possible armor and almost fully upgraded health. Overall, it's a pretty good game that I think a lot of people hate for pretty much no reason other than their own inability to tinker around with the graphic settings.",

I've read and watched a lot after spending some time with it and there is obviously a lot of 'covering of asses' that will continue for the foreseeable future. As it stands, it feels like what will eventually be an enjoyable, playable, more realistic assassin's creed experience eventually, but at the moment it's a $60 Beta with terrible performance and hilarious bugs and glitches throughout.  The combat is better than before, certainly offering more challenge, but once you realize there are actually only 3 weapons with various skins and stat upgrades, it's simply a means to an end. The cover system is barely acceptable and at times frustrating to maneuver, but at least they added stealth to what should have always been a stealth game, right? Meh.  The story is okay, but there rarely seems to incorporate the time-period save for a few late-game missions and a few interesting French Revolution-based Murder Investigations. Arno is an okay protagonist, but it's clear from the start that he's essentially a less interesting Ezio with a love interest in his first game rather than his third. By the time new characters are introduced, or in this case grow up, you are just expected to care about them. Your only insight into any of the characters' backstory is to assassinate them, so getting attached to a target is entirely meaningless, as you're unaware of your motivation for doing so until after they're dead. The large assassination mission structures, while diverse enough, lack any sort of tension because honestly, who cares if Templar A, B, or C has a backstory once they're dead, on to the next one. The modern-day story has become even less detached from significance. With Desmond gone and Black Flag getting away from a named protagonist, who needs to even play a character anymore? It's some of the laziest writing and gives you no clue as to what is even going on in the world any more, or if you should even care.  Side missions may be the most interesting part of the game. While the murder investigations weren't extremely challenging, they tied well into the time-period and some were extremely significant to the French Revolution. The lack of interesting in-game anecdotes led to my own research, which is telling to the level of care put in around the margins of this game, it is lacking significantly. The various other fetch quests and Co-Op missions are okay, and are useful if you're bored of single-player. At the end of those though, it's quite obvious, Unity is good at things it wants to be good at, it's okay at things you think it should be good, and it's terrible at things it needs to be good at.  In some form, optimized and fixed, and on sale, this game will be worth picking up, but skip it for now.",

Update: I'm not sure why some people haven't found my review useful, but I suppose keep that in mind. I would like to point out that my PC specs are as follows: FX-8350 with 16GB ram and an HD 7970  Part I:  As of patch 1.5 the game is more or less* running extremely well. Practically all bugs regarding quests/missions/co-op gameplay have been fixed. Microtransactions/Companion app walls have been almost entirely removed: You don't need to pay extra money, download something, or sign up for anything to be able to experience the full game anymore. I believe the Dead Kings DLC is now free and included in the purchase of AC: Unity.  *Patch 1.4 forced low quality distant environment textures, and Read: For compatiblity 1-3  For compatiblity:  1. DO NOT USE MSAA! This game is poorly optimized for MSAA, seriously don't use it. (I get better FPS at 2160p no AA than 1080p 2x MSAA) 2. If you're glitching through floors, and sticking on objects then you need to lower your graphic settings. 3. Ultra-high texture quality is amazing, but it's the biggest FPS hog next to MSAA (I think it's because it's linked to the hair physics) 4. Start the game with your desktop resolution as low as you can set it, for some reason this can give a huge performance increase. 5. If you're using an AMD GPU, DO NOT try to use any custom AMD game settings (if you do you can cause the game to crash on start up.) 6. If your game won't start up read 5. then verify game cache, if that doesn't work re-install. 7. DO NOT USE MSAA! (They might fix this, but I wouldn't hold my breath)   Graphic optimization: 1. Hair looks really good, but also bad if you play on a high-ish resolution with no AA. I recommend using 1080-1440p with FXAA. I honestly think this game looks worse in 2160p than 1080p (buildings look nice though.) 2. Shadow texture quality on Low is a must, if you need extra FPS, and looks very simlar to High. 3. I think Ultra-high texture quality is worth it, but a few times I had to lower it to get OK FPS. Evironmental quality looks pretty good even on low.  Part II:  Main-Story(ies): 1. This game probably has the best personal historical story out of all of the AC games to date.  2. The assasin's brotherhood story is garbage.  3. The modern outside-of-the-animus story doesn't exist.  Minigames/Side-missions: 1. Assasination missions finally have decent plots now, If you pay attention to dialog and the database entries they can be really enjoyable. 2. Murder mysteries, these are awesome. I found myself getting out a notebook and jotting things down to remember what clues I found, or who said what. 3. There a few others, all puzzle orientated.  Co-op: 1. Co-op missions have unique stories which are a lot of fun. They are playable solo, with friends or strangers. They get repetative quickly, but there are a lot of different ones to chose from.  Graphics: 1.Graphically this game is amazing. It's really hard to comprehend the scope of this game's world. I would really compare this game's world to GTA:V, but more compact and with detailed interiors and exteriors.  2. The faces, hair, facial movements are stupid good.  Gameplay: 1. Very fluid, being able to freerun down things makes the game so much more enjoyable. Before if you ran onto a small ledge you would have to do an awkward jump off, now you move how you want to. 2. The fighting mechanic is a bit different than previous AC games, since you're camera is much more personal. You now actually have to rotate you're camera to be able to see if someone is about to attack you. I feel like this mechanic is much more engaging and feels less like an impersonal button masher.  Part III:  Reasons to get AC: Unity: 1. Tons of historical locations, with tons of detail. Videos on YouTube do not do the buidlings justice. 2. Very solid personal Story 3. Good Story based side-activities that make you think 4. 20+ hours of gameplay (I ended up doing about 45-ish hours for the main story + dead kings DLC) 5. You're addicted to the assassin's creed series.  Reasons not to get AC: Unity: 1. Huge let down in terms of modern storyline progression. 2. Garbage assassin's Brotherhood storyline 3. You have a need for MSAA 4. Lots of listening and reading to get the full story 5. You still haven't recovered from AC:III",

            "review_text": "Well this is my first review for a game ever made.  Firstly, I'd like to say that the performance issues are true, whether you're playing it at Ultra High or Low Graphics, you'll have always from 20 to 55 fps with the BEST pc you can make. Knowing a great deal of stuff about computers and being a big fan of AC Franchise. This issue is mainly not because of the graphics but because of the AI that this game has. It has the biggest amount of AI's from the history of games. This is some serius improvement, but with it costs.  Secondly, though it has this main issue and others such as the face graphic glitch and some hit-boxes bugs, the experience you'll get for this game will be really great. The co-op in a game like this is something that it has never been created before and that really does worth the bugs and the graphic performance.  Thirdly, the main storyline, Arno's story, is great. This is a really well thought campaign and I think it's also worth all the bugs and performance problems. Some would say that it is not connected with any other game, but think how difficult was to the developers to get together the innovative ideas they had, about the co-op, about the single player, about Arno and about the subject (person) that is in the animus (or helix called in this game) moving and playing around with Arno.  I DO recommend this game, because I've played it all along at 25 -35 FPS in low settings with a Radeon HD 7850, 8 GB RAM, AMD A8 3870K APU x4 3.0GHz (Which I now regret having bought), SSD Kingston 128G, and it was still playable. In my country this PC has a value of 600 dollars aproximately. Which I earned for nearly a year reparing computers  You are not going to be upset more than some bugs and the performance issue. Because the story is immersive and real, made up in a real france from a real time; The Co-op is infinite, you could do the same mission infinite times and there would always be a new way to do it; The customization is varied, you get to choose gear that balances or enpowers your stealth, health, melee, and ranged abilities; the gameplay is versatile, you could engage and disengage fights with lots of combos from tools and weapons, you get to choose your fav weapon and even more. You'd have at least 80-100 hours of gameplay (singleplayer) and the rest leave it to the coop part.  Hope this comment helps you, and please rate.  PD: My native language is not English as you have noticed, so sorry for grammar and vocabulary mistakes.",

Even with high-end specifications, this game is VERY poorly optimized/not optimized at all for PC.

It's extremely sad since Assassin's Creed used to be a series that had extremely beautiful graphics and it ran smooth as butter on the low-end PCs, but lately they've been scaling up the graphics requirements exponentially and there's very little visual improvement at the cost of a metric f-ton of processing power.

So I can't tell much of the story. I guess it's good as far as I can tell.  The combat system is quite challenging at the beginning because your alter ego has to master fighting first.

            "review_text": "  Ok here's a quick FAQ:   - You wanna buy this? Buy on sale  - Is it good? Yes obviously, just don't listen to those people who keep yelling 'Unity Sucks'. You have to try it yourself.  - How's the story? It tells about a story of an assassin that raised by templar, and slowly he try to find out who is he and what assassin is.. It's not a bad story, but not so good either.   - How's the gameplay? 7/10. Sick parkour and combat animation, advanced character customization. They add new assassination mission mechanic, when you meet bosses, they will give you an area where your boss at and some ways to finish the mission, you can choose to obey all optional ways, some, or maybe not at all, it's up to you. New parkour mechanic has enhanced pretty much, there's a climb up and down button so you won't die in foolish way like in previous series. And, each story and assassin order has different mission set that won't get repetitive at all, it gives you a lot more variation in each mission, either main and side mission. But the combat not so optional, unlike the previous game. Also usable weapon limited, you can only use your equipped weapon in combat and hidden blade in assassination. It's also use skill point system like rpg, you have to unlock things with skill point that you can get as a reward by finishing story/coop mission or by collecting hidden skill point in each coop mission, nice concept but overused.  - How's the graphic? 10/10. The graphic is just, top notch, even to compare with nowadays (2016) games. Exposure, lightning, textures, blood splash, bloom, effect, timecycle, almost everything well executed, especially the lighting effect. IMO, this game had the most decent graphic at it's release.  - How rich the game world? The world felt so alive. Paris design in this game pretty well executed, even i can say that this game has most beautiful world design so far (IMO). The atmosphere of France Revolution felt alive, ped density and variety, objects, environment, everything succesfully executed. Ped in this game not just walk from point A to B, they have their own life. You will meet uncounted variation of activity, people fixing carriage, burning books, mad people, etc. And, it's not just exterior exploration, but they give you a lot of accessible from houses til' iconic building. And each interior has its typical design. Plus, they add underground map that explorable in freeroam.   - How's the coop? You will given two types of coop mission, heist and coop story mission. Some mission allow you to play up to 4 players, but some only 2. In heist, you will ordered to steal stuff or things from templars, the price is upon to how big the mission level. In story coop mission, there will be a specific story for the coop it self. You will given an order to do things just like main mission, and it will give you skill point and weapons/armor if you pass it. There are some hidden skill points that you have to collect by your self in story coop mission. Every coop mission can be finished by 1 player. Also you can make a clan and invite your friend to play together. Coop system also available for free roam, up to 4 players.  -PC port? It sucks at release, but it's getting better in each update and now (1.05 patch, lastest update) almost everything fixed, less glitch and bugs, stutter, etc. It's safe to be played for now. But you need at least 2gb ddr5 graphic card and i3 4130 or above to play it 30fps+. But honestly i can say that you need at least i5 or above with 3gb or above graphic card to run it smoothly and avoid below 30 fps drop. It's playable overall in i3+2gb graphic card but sometimes fps drop below 25, stutters happen sometimes but not often. Maybe it's because of steam and uplay overlay that make this game heavier that it should. I have tried play it in offline mode, with connection off, disabled steam and uplay overlay, it gives you 5fps or more. So yea, overall this game playable.  -Minus? There's pretty much serious issues in this game. I don't know for what reason, but they remove pretty much useful mechanics from previous game like whistle, body pickup, environmental blend assassination, stealing from peds, health reneration (it doesn't have to be like ac3/ac4 but at least regenerate 1-2 bar like ezio's series wasn't a big deal, right?) and many more, it's not a big deal but there will be a lot more fun with it on. And here's the serious one, skill point. It's not a bad concept although, adding little rpg mechanic add pretty much fun to this game but, the skill point, seriously? It's not a problem at all if you asked to use skill point to unlock special ability like disguise, advanced lockpicking, additional health, etc. But, oh god, you also have to unlock things such as rolling, double air and double normal assassination, environmental blend, stun enemy, ranged weapon control (you have to unlock firing gun skill to be able to equip ranged weapon?!), and many more things that supposed to be unlocked at first or at least as soon as you get assassin robe. One more, you can't create multiple save slot like in previous game, there will be only one save slot, and you have to remove it if you wonder to start a new game. Also there's some serious problem in combat, you can only assassinate with hidden blade, fight with your equipped weapon (it mean only one) which in previous game you can use a lot of weapon and it could be combined while in combat, and it's kinda sad. The combat system pretty challenging because of leveling system but too simple either. In combat there are only such kind like dodging, stun, heavy attack, light attack, finishing, that's all. AC3/4 combat maybe could be way too easy because it's used 'beat'em all' combat system like batman arkham did, but it so much more fun because it's a lot more optional, you can disarm and takes enemy weapon, fighting enemy with bare hand, hidden blade, using items like rope dart, snare, pistol to counter and create sick animation, kinda miss that.  - How long it'll take to finish the game? It would take around 20 hours for the main story only. Including side mission, it will take around 30-50 hours to finish it. If you're a completionist, it would spend more than 60 hours to take.  Overall, it's a good game, it could be another successfull game of the series if only ubisoft more patient, not release the game too early, not remove useful mechanic from previous series in stealth and combat mechanics. 8/10.",

            "review_text": "This game tries many things, but sadly failes miserably. To keep things spoiler free I'll say the plot is boringly average. Its the standard revenge trip and you have to kill countless people to finally reach the person responsible. Its boring plot and you don't really care about any of the characters within the game. Now stepping aside plot another big issue this game has is its controls. Yes, the horrible controls return and worst then ever. Arno wants to grab onto anything and the controls are responsive some of the times, but still there will be momments when you want to rip out your hair due to frustration. And Finally the cherry on this painfully average game. The glitches/ai. Yes even after patch 4 the game still stutters and has framerate drops. I have a lenovo y 50 with an 880 geforce gtx graphics card and the framerate dips under 30 on MEDIUM graphics settings many many many times. And there are still bugs to where there is clipping disappearing and reappearing civillians, Civillans that drive around in an invisible clown car and run across the streets. I dont know what ubisoft was thinking but quanity over quality is never a good thing. Especially when the game will run like complete ♥♥♥♥ because of it. Another gripe I have with the game is the detection mechanic. Sometimes the Ai will be completly ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and forget where you are even though you are in front of them. And then there will be times where they can spot you miles away. Another thing is the combat. Yes it is difficult but only difficult because the game fights with you because of the controls. If you're going to try to copy Arhkam's fighting then atleast do it with respect. Not this half ♥♥♥ garbage. Seriously I was looking foward for this game and to see its still this bad is disappointing. Stay away from this game. There are better games out there worth your money. If you are a fan of the franchise, still stay away. Ubisof cann't get a pass for this piece of ♥♥♥♥ excuse of an assassins creed game.",

The multiplayer bits are extremely fun when played with a full group. Some of the controls are a bit different from the previous games and you really need to get used to those before expecting to be great at this game. Free running takes a bit more effort as it's been divided into a free run up and free run down catagory by pressing spacebar and E respectively. The graphics are really good when you have the hardware to support them, the recent patches by Ubisoft have cleared up most of the glitches and frame lags that have been present in the earlier editions, I haven't stuttered once in the time I've played it.  The Companion app which you need to open blue chests really isn't a huge deterrent from the real game, it's very similar to Kenway's fleet and other minigames of that sort in the other AC games and if you have windows 8 you can use the app for free or put it on your smartphone. As for people complaining about microtransactions in the game, there are relatively few. You can unlock things quicker by paying for 'Helix Credits' but the only things unlockable soley through Helix Credits are timesaver packs which are wholly unnecessary. Skills must be purchased with sync points which aren't extremely difficult to earn and I feel like it adds a new angle to the game as you have to prioritize your skills and aren't immediately thrown into the game knowing everything. TL;DR This is a really good game, it takes some getting used to and if you have a low grade system you probably won't be able to run it extremely well but if you have the hardware to support this game and the patience to learn the intricacies of it, it's certainly worth picking up (Especially on sale).",

No crashes or anything else to speak of yet. I'm thoroughly enjoying the game, especially after just having played through all of Rogue.  To be frank this game does a lot right that the previous games could have done better and there's two very important things that I can mention:  1. Offering a reward system for 100% synching a memory. If you have more incentive to do the optional objectives, it makes the experience more enriching and it makes you actually want to accomplish those objectives. Putting optional objectives just for the sake of doing them for a % completion doesn't offer much incentive.  2. Changing the combat so that every weapon isn't an insta-kill monster and this goes hand in hand with number 1. You will actually want to obtain and upgrade armor and weapons and the such now that there's a different impact on combat and you're not tearing up groups of 20 enemies with relative ease.",

Saying that, has some pretty sweet addiditons, like the modular armor, where you can customize each part and build a fairly unique assassin. The Co-op is good too, with rewards like cash and Armor peices that you can't otherwise get. There are also 'Murder Mysteries' that you can play dectective and discover who commited the crime, which I throughly enjoyed, except that you can just run straight to the culprit and accuse them with no evidence and still get the maximum reward, so don't know what that's all about.  As of this writing, 1/22/15 there are numerous bugs and glitches in the game, from what I understand a lot of them have been hammered out, but one that I keep falling prey to is a strange 5 second lag, where the game locks up, and when gameplay resumes, all the cloth and hair physics move like they got pulled 5 feet in the air, and bounce back to normal. If you happen to be climbing or walking on uneven terrain when this happens, you can be 'stuck' in the ground, or in the air, completly unable to do anything, forcing a reload to last checkpoint. which can get VERY frusterating.  All in all, despite the glitches, I am finding myself enjoying this game, and playing with friends with the Open World Co-Op. Just give it a little patience.",

            "review_text": "Is it worth 60$? Not in its current state, no. I'd recommend picking it up on a sale, which is exactly what I did. Was it worth 40$? I'd say yes. Before purchasing I contacted a few people and the consensus was that it is indeed more stable than it was on release, two months ago.  Admittedly Ubisoft has garnered some good will from me. There have been a few misses. AC Liberation wasn't good. Watch Dogs was underwhelming, and AC3 was a bit of a difficulty spike for the franchise.  Consider the game right before Unity. Black Flag was absolutely wonderful and I recommend it to everyone (Seriously, go play it if you haven't already. Show Ubisoft that we can reward their quality work).  There is the framerate issue which I do find annoying on ocassion. I'd be fine for a while but then all of the sudden the game will stutter and suddenly I'm looking straight into the sky, or completely turned around. During chases, this issue has caused me to start running back into groups of guards I was fleeing from.  But the game seems to be judged primarily on the amount of glitches it has. Yes, it was a very messy release. Yes, it did prove that people need to stop preordering. However. Is the game fun? Yes, yes it is.  I have 22 hours on it so far, so allow me to set aside the PR misshaps and various glitches and let me tell you about the game itself:  You play as a faceless, nameless gamer. The Assassin order hacks your feed and recruits you into the Brotherhood. I'm not fond of this framing device honestly, because I myself am not really one capable of saving the world. And how we can save the world while playing a game is beyond me, but whatever. They place you in the memories of Arno whom is essentially Ezio 2.0, which some of you may recall kind of outstayed his welcome when stretched across three games. Arno seems to quickly become a loyal Assassin which is a bit uninteresting when compared to the more colorful Kenway to the last game.  But the game is fairly solid. The combat is a little more balanced this time around. Counter-attacking no longer oneshots enemies but opens them up for a flurry of your own attacks. No longer are we legion-clearing badasses. If you let them, enemies will swarm and murder your Arno regardless of gear. Bullets, also more realistically, will kill you in two hits. If you don't pay attention to your surroundings, the game will punish you for it. And that is awesome.  Gear has taken a more RPG-like vibe. In previous games, gear only served to add to your health. This time, there are various statistics like detection speed, health, and bonus ammunition pools for your gun and bombs. Each peace has a focus between health bonuses, stealth and ranged and you're free to choose which line you focus on. (I personally go for stealth stuff). It's interesting but I'm not sure if it's a better system. It all ties back to the fact that enemies will continue to hurt if you let them, as we can't really one-shot people in open combat any longer. That said, once you get a 5-star sword you can mow through enemies - As long as you pay attention!  Multiplayer. It has various levels of function. Most of the time I've tried it, nobody has a mic. The one time I connected with someone, we actually had to connect through steam and I replied to his speech via Uplay (I don't have a mic). This was very clunky because Uplay wouldn't let me make a call without some kind of input device. Or something. I don't know. The rest of the time, each multiplayer match turns into this madhouse of combat. Without coordination, without any way to talk to these people ingame via text, stealth is thrown out the window. Within seconds of being given control of our characters, inevitably I see my screen blink red and combat has begun with my teammates. So the promotional videos of all those coordinated attacks? Doesn't happen. Good idea in theory but I don't believe it's working as intended.  Am I forgetting something? Oh yes. The microtransaction function. 22 hours and I've barely looked at it twice. Complain all you want but it's actually very, very easy to ignore. I still don't even know how to 'get' more 'Helix' points if I wanted to.  Ultimately, nothing so far has been completely game breaking, which is an improvement from release.  Allow me to sum up with some added notes:  PROS -Combat is given some more complexity. No longer a powerhouse by Act 2 of the game. Can't one-shot counter. Enemies seem to be aware of this and will take advantage. Forces a player to pay attention (And I love this). -Gear is varied and fun to mix, match, and experiment with. -Multiplayer is doable, but with some problems. -Boss fights are more interesting than punching a fat man to death.  CONS -Glitches still present, just depends on your level of patience. -Framerate drops is an issue for absolutely everyone and probably isn't our computers. It's probably on Ubi's end. -Map is a bit of a spam of icons. -Multiplayer is doable, but lack of coordination turns every single mission into pure combat and nothing else.  MIXED -Blue chests can only be opened with some cell phone App. I do not have this capability. -Microtransactions are easily ignored. -Arno is fairly forgettable as a protagonist. There are side characters I care more about than him. (Elise, for example). -Areas have difficulty gates. Normally in this series (And other games), I'd prioritize exploring and nabbing all those towers to open up my map. This got me killed a few times as a fledgling assassin when 5-star enemies started to one-shot me with their spears. I'm not sure how I feel about this, other than 'Mixed', thus this section.  Worth 60$? Nah. Worth a sale? Sure! Beyond the messy launch and bad business practices from Ubisoft, this isn't that bad an installment to this franchise. It just depends on your threshold of patience and how easy you can ignore a few of the problems.",

With two hundred + hours of total play time between the previous two AC games, I can easily say that Unity beats both AC3 and Black Flag in any measurable contest. If you like the style of game, you should love this one.  I have seen very little issues as far as glitches. The only exception is the ocassional ragdoll effect on a downed enemy gets a little excited. It seems that this game is guilty of only one thing: It is poorly optimised. So if you have a slower/older rig or are trying to play it on a console (*sigh), you may have problems running it at a reasonable frame rate and/or glitch free.  Long and Boring:  1) The graphics!...oh god the graphics!! They're absolutely gorgeous maxed out... but it's always the little things that make it truly great:   Amazing PhysX application   - Makes for a lot of great enemy/NPC dynamics in fights and death scenes.  - Awesome light play off particles in the air gives the atmosphere a real life quality  - Motion of clothing looks incredible. It really looks like the characters are wearing the clothes (not just skins that flap around when you move).  2) The volume of people that move around and gather together in huge crowds will amaze you. Seeing several hundred fully rendered and independant civilians all in the same place is one of the coolest parts of this game. Lots of games do crowds, I get that, but it's a sight to see how these masses of people are done in AC Unity.   3) The 'RPG' element that Ubisoft put into this game is essentially BS. It's largely a super nerfed and vanilla form of an RPG concept. However, it's a welcome development coming from a franchise that had essentially no prior character development (besides weapons and gear). The reality is that you will eventually have every skill you want and in fairly little time. The only real decision ends up being which skills you want first. There is no personel development to the character, just skill unlocks. This makes for a very minor overall impact to your play style and ultimately goes unoticed as a feature in this game. It's a fun little perk, but largely useless. At least it doesn't make the game worse?  AC has never been about the RPG style of play, so this is hardly a fair criticism. To me, it really seems like this is the kind of game that could do very well if given more depth. It would definitly be more satisfying to spend time playing (or replaying for that matter). So although it was a bit of a cheeseball effort, I give Ubisoft a big thumbs up for even trying to move AC in the right direction.  4) The fighting is defenitly harder in AC Unity than in previous games, so that's a plus. However, with no difficulty adjustment, it can become too easy as you progress in power and skill throughout the game.   - Weapons have a parry skill that gets better as they increase in cost, meaning you can't necessarily parry every attack when you first begin. Dodging/rolling becomes necessary to stay alive.  - Heavy weapons and long weapons have been introduced into AC Unity and both provide a fun change in fighting style that can keep battles fresh after you've mastered one style.  5) THE BEST PART: The absolutely rediculous, cluncky, and completely unnecessary 'Abstergo' storyline gets the back shelf for this title. Even Ubisoft has aknowledged how stupid this story line is; they poke fun in-game at the fact that the Abstergo story line is disorienting and distracting to the immersion of the game. Luckily for all of us, this goofy concept is minimized in AC Unity.  Conclusion:  1) 9/10 for the AC line up 2) You need a good GPU to run it with no glitches (I have a GTX 780 3GB). 3) Haters gonna hate, especially console kids.",

            "review_text": "As everyone knows, the initial release of this game was plagued with performance issues. So many issues in fact, that many customers felt they were blatantly cheated out of their money by Ubisoft. When I first played the game, my FPS was so low that I couldn't play it. However now that these issues are fixed, I've realized something unfortunate about the game. It was released broken and in a despicable state, and yet is one of the best, if not the best Assassin's Creed title to date.   PROS:  1. Story: One of the best stories in the Assassin's Creed games. Arno (the main character) feels like an assassin and never becomes an overpowered master assassin. The overall theme of the story isn't about revenge or building up the assassin order. It's about joining a necessary evil to fight another to protect that which Arno loves.  2. City: The city of Paris looks awesome. One of the best cities in the series. You also get to experience rifts in the Animus where you get to see Paris in different time periods. The contrast is spectacular and not only makes you want to visit those other time periods longer, but also makes you appreciate revolutionary Paris even more.  3. Customization: This is one of the things that really sold me. While in the past Assassin's Creed games you could dye your outfit, in Unity, you can mix and match buyable and unlockable pieces to create your own assassin outfit. Personally I liked the look of the Napoleon outfit pieces. Of course you can still change colors as well. The assassins in this game abandon the white of the assassin order for a multitude of different colors and it works well. Arno in his blue looks spectacular.   In addition to the costume customization, you can also purchase different skills through earning an in-game currency called Synchonization Points. They can be stealth skills such as double assassinations, or abilities to handle different weapons or purchase new types of throwable bombs. While many players were disappointed that you don't unlock skills as the story progresses, I enjoyed unlocking these skills through this method. In addition, you can of course buy new weapons or upgrade them.  4. Assassinations: The assassinations are superb. Each assassination gives you info on distractions/events/anything that can help you in assassinating your target. It gives you the amount of entrances, guards and potential advantages. Assassinations do not feel so scriped as in previous games and this game lets you do them as you wish.   CONS:  1. Game Peformance: As stated earlier, the initial performance issues made the game unplayable. However once the patches came out and I updated my drivers, I found the performance much improved. The were occassional crashes, a number of minor glitches and annoyingly long loading times, but the game more than made up for it.  2. Ubisoft's Crap: UPlay is still as annoying as ever. Microtransactions are still as annoying as ever (does anyone but middle schoolers actually use them?). To unlock certain costumes and even chests, you need the Assassin's Creed Nomad app and some other thing, which is annoying. I played the Nomad app to unlock the Altair costume and the app is both annoying and I haven't unlocked the costume despite the only requirement being to have synched it to the game. Also my biggest complaint is that you cannot restart your progress without doing some tinkering and deleting files. Why? Well because Ubisoft made the poor decision to substitute a cloud save for an in-game save. You only get one profile in the game and you can't delete it. If you want to restart your progress, you can't do so from the game and you can't create any new profiles.      In conclusion, I would definetely recommend this game. The initial performance issues were inexcusable (Ubisoft needs to stop rushing games for yearly installments) and Ubisoft's poor business decisions are annoying. However as far as the gameplay mechanics and the story goes, I was very impressed. I played for about 6 hours straight, which is something very difficult for me to do. Should you have the PC to run it and are a fan of the series, I would most defintely recommend this game.",

It carries a heafty collection of color schemes and options of play styles, making it pleasantly customizable.

            "review_text": "I'm a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed Series. Sadly though in the last few years the games (well, more likely Ubisoft) has let me down. It started with revelations (not a great game storywise) and went on to AC3 (a huge dissapointment. Mainly because it had so much potential, but they half arsed it instead of taking their time). What really annoyed me, was that AC3 was so bugged i wasn't able to get the game to 100% completion. And believe me, i tried! So when all hope was lost, along came AC4: Black Flag. And what a beautiful game it was. Good story, beatiful setting and a open world to die for! So with all my hopes back up i bought AC Unity with the season pass. 80€ wasted.  Don't get me wrong, i absolutely love this game! The freedom and the setting is as if you had combined the best two games in the series (AC2 and Black Flag). There are a lot of new features which gives the game a new edge compared to the ones before, like the Co-op. (For more details on the new features, read other comments) So why not recommend it? My fps aren't great even though my settings are at the lowest. But seeing that my PC isn't top-of-the-range, that doesnt bother me. Because even though the settings are on 'Low' the game still is beautiful. So that's not the reason. My main problem is, is that the game constantly crashes. When it happens once in a while: ok, it can happen. But 3 times in two hours? That's pushing it. I want to love this game! I really do! But in this state it's unplayable and it just ruins the entire experience. So it's with regret that i have to not-recommend it. Wait until its on sale in a year or so. Maybe then it'll be halfway fixed and worth it's money.  -- EDIT: Since the new updates (From Ubisoft and Nvidia) this game hasn't crashed once on me (and I just played it 10h straight). So now that my only reason not to recommend it has been dealt with, I can finally give this game a thumbs up!  On another note: what initaially seemed like a huge waist of money, surprisingly turned out to be a very good buy (I'm not including the free Ubisoft game For the season pass owners). Not just story and graphics wise, alone the extraordinary amount of content is worth spending the hard earned cash. I'm guessing i will be playing this game for over 100h (probably for 150) until I reach 100% completion, which I havent done since Revelations. And I'm glad I'll be spending that much time with the game!  So yes! Buy the game if you are an Assasin's Creed fan and want to relive the freedom and history of Assassin's Creed 2 combined with the beauty and innovation of AC4: Black Flag.  But be warned: there are still quite a few bugs in the game (though, only minor ones, like falling through the floor or glitching pedestrians). And it's unlikely that they'll be fixed. So if you are an Exterminator and hate bugs of all kind, buy this game when it's on sale. Otherwise go ahead and dive into revelutionary Paris!

I personally loved the game aside from the odd storyline.  I think the Assassin's order is a complete mess in this game, they seem fractured and annoying... Arno would have been better off never speaking to them. The story line honestly feels like a complete mess to me and I don't understand the motivation of most of the characters. On the flip side I do like Arno and felt he was a more rounded character.  The game only crashed two or three times in all the times I played it and I only had one or two minor glitches. Nothing worth noting, again, this was after the first two patches came out. The parkour in this game is the best in the series, there was a lot less jumping off of crap unintentionally and the combat was a huge improvement. Personally I don't like being able to take on 50 guards at once and walk out unscathed, I do prefer a little more realistic combat unlike prior AC games where you can drop a smoke bomb and kill three guards instantly.  I didn't care to try the Nomad companion app to open the blue chests and I was not interested in unlocking armor from other games using Initiates. I personally don't like wearing the outfits from the other games because I feel like it makes the main character look even more out of place than he already does.  The multiplayer is fun now that it works but the missions are also playable and completable solo. I didn't mess with clubs (or whatever Ubisoft called guilds/clans).  All in all it was a great game, my only complaint aside from the idiotic French Assassin's Guild was that all the tie in apps and programs like initiate were not up and running at game launch. Most people are going to beat the game and then not play it, so if something is not ready at launch, it may never get used and become a waste of time.",

So all in all its playable on a good pc.  3. MOST IMPORTANT: The game on its own is full of amazing aspects and terrible things.... For example the city looks gorgeaus but it doesnt really render far so you always see some super pixelated stuff. The stealth and fighting system were mad way more complicated, which is awesome, but on most missions its almost impossible to stealth and fighting many enemys is to hard so you just rage quit. co-op is fun, but the club (guild type thing) only shows myselfe instead of the other club members. and so on....  TLDR: Its not the strongest out of the ac games but if you enjoy the series, have a good pc and its on sale buy it! (if not go buy black flag mate)  7/10",

            "review_text": "ALL PLAY DONE ON PATCH 4  I started a drunken bar brawl and lost my favorite pocket watch. Instead of learning from my lesson and that the pocket watch was the price paid I killed three to four dozen guys to get the watch back. Setting me up for lifelong success.  UPDATE: Now that I've finished the main story line, some thoughts.  I still recommend the game *if* you have the system to run it and like the series, however it's one of the weakest in the series.  For reference I ran the game at 1920x1080 with graphics max'd and rarely had a performance issue (i7-3770, 16GB RAM, GTX 970 4GB RAM, 64GB SDD as a cache on top of a 1TB drive). Was this top notch FPS? No it wasn't, I think every Assassin's Creed is a bit of a slog, but the performance wasn't bad at all, it was consistently good enough to pretty much never distract from the experience.  Anyways onto the game itself:  - City itself is incredible visually, it's a shame the main story line doesn't take you to the southern areas to help break up the visuals.  - You never really get into the character, as such I developed my own thoughts about who and what the character believed in. Only to then get into scripted sequences where my character would act out of line with my perception of who I've developed him to be. This makes for a bad experience. Why does this happen? There are three reasons I think:  1) Not enough time is spent developing the character into an assassin. Just one day you are one, and you can do some pretty crazy stuff right from day one. Missed opportunity to grow the character here.  2) All your equipment upgrades and skill upgrades are simply a function of hitting ESC and purchasing them from a menu when you have the resources. Huge missed opportunity here to force interactions between the character and his peers here help flesh him out as well as the backstory.  3) Some of the main story available to help fill in who the character is and why he's doing what he's doing come in the form of letters delivered to your home. However there is no notification when a letter arrives. It was only at the conclusion of the game that I became aware that there were a stack of letters to read because the area they're placed in you have little reason to visit.  These are all things Black Flag does MUCH MUCH better, it's a shame to see such a step back.  - Ignore the folks complaining about MTX, the MTX in this game can be completely ignored. First upgrade your base in Paris as fast as possible, between the income you generate with it and by simply collecting chests, cockades, and completing crowd events while you travel to story missions you'll quickly have almost top tier equipment. This is another area of game imbalance. Within ~4-6 hours of playing the game I had gear that was so much better than the content I was being provided that it made combat largely a joke until the very end of the game. It also made weapon and armor rewards from most quests totally irrelevant and made the benefit of doing the quests seem nil. Gear progression is very poorly thought out and the game experience suffers for it (Disclaimer: I did come into the game with some level of rewards already from playing previous games in the series, I'm not sure how much this impacted the experience).  - Locked Chests, Initiate Chests, Nomad Chests - all of these make for a horrible experience. Two reasons:  1) Right off the bat they're visible on your minimap, so you're inclined to go and try to collect them. What happened to buying maps that add this info to your ingame map? This AC standard is nowhere to be seen and would help gate map clutter.  2) Once you find a chest and realize you're not able to open it there's nothing added to your information that allows you to note that it can't be opened currently. - Once you approach a locked chest it should be noted on your map in some fashion what level the chest is. - Initiate Chests should only become available/visible once you've reached the appropriate initiate level. - There should be an option to hide Nomad Chests or some sort of filtering if you don't want to play the companion mobile app (it's unclear if these chests count towards % complete or not)  - Normal chests behind locked doors, these are really dickish. Shouldn't be done, or the level of the locked door should be added to your map information.  - High level chests on low level story missions, you spend 3/4th of the game doing story quests and while on them generally at some point passing by chests you can't unlock. Very frustrating, locked chests encountered on story missions should be at a skill level you could open at that point in the story. I eventually conditioned myself to never approach a locked chest until I had max'd my lockpick level.  - Climbing - all the new moves/animations when climbing are awesome. However there are many times Arno found hand holds where none appear to be present and many more times I saw places that looked like obvious hand holds that I couldn't get Arno to use.  - BUG: There appears to be a bug that if you ledge kill someone you then can't climb up onto said ledge until you move somewhere else then move back, then attempt to climb up onto the ledge. This made many 'badass entrances' into a room a lot less so as Arno fumbles around.  - Disconnect: Sometimes Arno will leap incredible distances from one roof top to another, very inhuman distances covered, yet he'll not do the same when trying to air assassinate someone. Frustrating.  - Double Air Assassinations are too hard to pull off. There are times it appears obvious you will get one to instead only get one guy.  - Crowd Events - I liked these, but they are too frequent. Many times they crop up when they shouldn't, these should be suppressed when on a story mission. There's no ingame way to preview the rewards for completing the crowd events. Also sometimes these come off silly - ex: a thug is literally killing a citizen in front of some guards and the guards only react once the citizen is dead, not at the point the thug starts attacking.  - AI - The AI is horrible, you can make a mockery of just about any mission. Fighting piles of guards while others not too far away don't even recognize a fight has occurred. Enemy NPCs are able to identify you entirely too easy sometimes. Sometimes it'd be just the top of my head visible over a rooftop or through two sets of windows and it'd set a guard off. Guards not aware of or responding to crowds of citizens fleeing the scene of a murder.  (SPOILER) Perhaps my favorite of all was an early mission where a bonus objective was to kill a guy in a confessional booth. I killed three of his guards literally right outside the confessional booth. He inspected each one, thought nothing of it and stepped into the confessional booth. These are the Templar that have somehow almost taken over France?  (SPOILER) Second favorite was when I was to assassinate La Touché while he was at the Gallows. There were a ton of guards and a very large crowd about. In the course of removing all the perimeter guards I managed to scare away almost all of the crowds. However the guards and La Touché up on the guillotine platform were none the wiser. People were running to and fro to avoid the massacre. Eventually cleared enough of the crowd out that thugs assaulting citizens and pickpockets stealing women’s purses started to spawn right in the middle of the mission area. The whole thing was a giant circus.  (SPOILER) The Disguise skill is such a copout. You can disguise yourself as the final boss and walk right up to his face and stab him - _RIDICULOUS_!  In general through a combination of the poor AI, spotty mission design and my impatience with AC:U's rough edges the game was less Assassin's Creed and more Murder Everyone Creed, more so than any previous AC. Was still largely entertaining however and looked fantastic.",

Your character took the knowledge gained from ancestors and applied to the real world. Unity has none of that. In fact, you could completely miss Unity in your AC playthrough (Meaning if you were to play all the games in order) and you would miss no important segments of the AC real world Storyline.   ...Like excuse me, did the world not end?

However,  2)Controls: Mouse and keyboard can be extremely clunky. The game seems to respond much quicker when using controller input. It is still playable without a controller but you might want to make sure you have a decent stock of medicine as you'll be missing parries and dodges more frequently than you'ld like.  3)Graphics: The graphics are very well done, as is true in most AC games. Cutscenes might skip frames, but I find them still enjoyable. What is not enjoyable however is that it seems one of every three cutscenes are un-skippable. Some of you might agree or disagree, but I like to have the option to skip a long boring cutscene if I want to. At the moment the in-game pause menu is a blinding white box of eye-burning brightness with the occasional flicker (not sure If it's just me, or if others have also experienced it) that can just barely be navigated by concentrated squinting and guesswork. I'm hoping that future patches will fix this.   In my personal view, and from what I've played so far, I feel the game is not as enjoyable as Black Flag. But it is a blessed step up from AC3 and I am cautiously optimistic and just a wee bit hopeful that as the developers scramble to fix what is broken, and eventually (again, hopefully) the game might become a shiny bit of silver in the Assassin's Creed treasury.",

First things first : Paris is huge, magnificent, full with stuff to do and to see. I live in Paris myself and even discovered a few locations I didn't know about.   I like the story and how it is told. It's something that was completely off with the latest ACs : the story telling was completely off and it was just annoying.  I, for one, hated all of the 'present' phases, which are completely absent from that episode, so it makes it even more appreciable for me.  Yes, the game needs a very high end rig (which I have) to run smoothly. But we're at that period of time in between two generation of consoles where games evolve and it will take some time for the 'average' PC to be in par with what those new consoles can do. Yet I completely agree that the developpers COULD optimize the game much better. They just never do, just deal with it. And with all graphics parameters maxed out, the game looks gorgeous.  I didn't meet any really handicaping bugs. NPCs sometimes do weird stuff, but with so much of them on the streets, can you really blame them ? Again, comparing with older episodes, it seems to be much improved (I'm looking at you, AC 3...)  All in all, excellent game, that will best be experienced with a high end PC, but that doesn't surprise me, nor does it bother me.",

After Ubisoft has stated that they released a 2nd patch for PC, I decided to give it a go. ACU has the most beautiful graphics that I have ever seen on a video game. This being said with my graphics only set to high. The detail is truly incredible, and there is no doubt that this is why there were so many initial bugs and glitches.  So far, I have experienced no significant performance issues. With my specs, I am able to run the game on high graphics settings with the only minor framerate drops occuring when encountering large crowds of people, at synchronizing points, or when it rains. This isn't too big of a deal to me, as this also seemed to happen in Black Flag and other AC titles and doesn't really affect gameplay at all. No characters falling through floors, floating in mid-air, or anything extreme like that.  Gameplay review: I won't say too much about the main story, but let's just say Ubisoft has impressed me so far yet again with their new approach to the templar vs assassin theme in the French Revolution. I love the new parkour animations including the controlled descent ability. It really makes the character's movements feel more life-like. Don't even get me started on the customization options for Arno as far as clothes and weapons go. I have yet to try the co-op missions yet, so I am unable to comment on those. The new combat style is slightly different and more challenging than previous AC titles, but nothing that you won't be able to pick up after a few street fights. So far, I am very satisfied with ACU.  From my personal experience, I have to recommend this game at this point. I will update as needed.  ",

Ubisoft has yet again released a fairly poor PC port packed with bugs and glitches as far as the eye can see. Though after a few hours of tweaking setting I finally ended up with a playable version. That's not so say it wasn't without it's bugs, but it is a version of the game that I can recommend. Before I go on, I will mention that this game does in fact have micro transactions. Which is greedy and unfortunate, but they aren't required and used as an optional way to unlock things without playing the game.  The art direction is enough to sell this game, it's beautiful and the most realistic open world I have ever seen in a game. People fill up your screen as far as the eye can see which is impressive in itself, but it also adds the mechanic that we saw in the first AC trailer where Altair is picking off people in the crowd. Looks isn't all this one brings to the table though, this game is one of the most innovative ACs in terms of gameplay. This time around you aren't given so many tools, but you're able to specialize in a weapon of your choice. Swinging a rifle around like a bo staff is something I don't think I've seen in a game, and it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Aside from combat though, the free running system has been tweaked with two buttons, one to go up and down, this is such a small change but it gives you so much more freedom.  All and all, technical issues aside, this game is well worth the price of admission for any AC fan in my personal opinion.  *Edit: I suppose I should note that I'm running a 690(Multi-GPU) with one half dedicated to phys-x. Thats what I had to do to stop the stuttering. Textures are set to high, and AA is set to FXAA, everything else is set to very high and it runs at a fairly consistant framerate.",

Well I'm playing now for about an hour and if anything changes I will update this review. I have expierenced some slight fps stuttering in cutscenes on ultrahigh setting, but thats it I'm running around for a while in the town without expierenceing any issues so far and again I do that on Ultrahigh preset. When I started this game this morning I had to download an update downt know if this is why its running better than for other users. What I have read so far is that people like me with the 4gb 770 often give positive reviews so I can only assume the game works better or at least for now best on this card. Since I can't say anything bad about the performance I can only recommand the game for everyone who has a 770 like me I'm not saying other people are talking crap or have crapy hardware, but it works flawless besides some slight stuttering in cutscenes for me so thats it for the performance.  To the actual game its like every assassins creed the assassins story is well integrated in the actual france story and actual history happenings. The gameplay feels nice and easy like in all other assassins creeds the controls are also the same as allways, well overall its just another assassins creed I personally like the character even tough I liked the pirate outlaw feeling of Black flag a bit more than the french wannabe Casanova. Well thats it for now can't say too much about the actual story I have to play some more to get more in detail.  Even if I personally with my specs don't expierence fps drops lags whatever I would not recommend the game to anyone right now. I would only recommend it to people with the same gpu cpu combination since my review is based on my personal hardware and a lot of other users have obviously problems with hardware that has similar performance.  I personaly would test the game before buying it I don't have to say you guys how to do that, but at least be a honest person if it works buy it. Otherwise wait a week if you see the game got a update try it.  A short word for the overall nextgen game's I'm honestly disapointed how 'bad' the 'next gen' looks if this is the future of gaming graphics I can only say I have games that are a few years old that have more detail in textures. The effects got quite nice tough. I really can only hope that other next gen games get better since if this is ultrahigh it is more like a step back in time for PC gaming the game is fun anyways that are just my two cents so if you hate me for it so be it.",

Cut-scenes lag a bit but textures look great. No crashes after several hours of gaming. Vintage UbiSoft post-launch optimization will improve gameplay a bit - whenever that happens.  As for the game, it's fun. A lot of the gameplay from the last game is carried over, which I consider a good thing. Maps are beautiful and well-detailed, and the storyline is deep and intriguing. UbiSoft seems to be going a bit overboard with their micro-transactions, but, from what I can tell, none of them seem necessary or provide a glaring advantage, so I think it's harmless.   If you're a fan do the AC series, then you kinda have to play it. However, keep in mind that this is a highly graphic-intensive game (and, as of launch, a poorly optimized one), so if you've got a rig with less than the recommended specs, either be prepared to sacrifice detail for FPS or wait for a post-launch patch and driver updates.",

A lot of people criticise the story, I for one have enjoyed it so far. It isn't as good as Black Flag, but it is still quite enjoyable. The voice acting is very engaging and they finally managed to have decent faces (although the hair is not so good).  Combat is not very good, as it is a poor attempt at making it more arkham style whilst still using the AC base combat mechanics. It's a bit too slow and feels unresponsive a lot of the time. However, it isn't worse than previous AC game's combat since it was never very good to begin with. Counter spam is still there, it just works differently.  If you enjoyed all the Assassin's Creed games, this is more Assassin's Creed. I enjoyed all of them and so far am enjoying this one so probably worth getting if you are really into this series.",

But regardless of the technical issues people have been claiming about and I have no doubt that they're there. But the game itself is in my opinion great. It alters the traditional formula that ubisoft has been employing for years making it a refreshing new expierience. One example is the combat, it's now at least somewhat difficult. There were a couple times where I died and not due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reasons. This is refreshing for assassin's creed, seeing as for the past numerous games the auto 'counter' was essentially the kill button. They altered the way you approach assassinations too, more like a puzzle analyzing your envrioment careful to take out a target, I also like how there's numerous ways to assassinate different targets. The emphasis on the assassination, and this new planning mechanic towards your meaningful assassinations are rewarding. Perching up on a rooftop plotting your entrance, how you'll assassinate the target and planning your escape route, then seeing it all come together is satisfying. Mechanically the game is solid, no complaints from me, in my opinion Ubisoft perfected the free running aspect of assassin's creed back with assassin's creed II in 2009 and ever since no other game has tried to touch this kind of psuedo-realistic open world gameplay. I do wish that ubisoft was a little more inventive though, it seemed they took the call of duty approach overloading the game with a bunch of weapons that are closer to being the same than different. which I think is just unecessesary. But the only negatives thus far, is that ubisoft was nearly as creative as I wish they were with the weapons, not differentiating them enough from one another. But the level of customization is still robust, so when you play online you're different enough from other players. I personally don't have any friends who own this game. But the one match I played was interesting, coming from someone who normally never even touches the multiplayer of other assassin's creeds I was impressed with the new co-op, essentially missions around the city will indicate how many players can play, and you can either play them by yourself or with a friend or 3 friends online. I still have yet to try the multiplayer out more but it looked interesting as far as I could see. One last bit, the story telling and charecters are top notch, personally as someone who only played assassin's creed, AC2, and Revalations, and AC revaltions in my opinion had the strongest of the storylines, Assassin's creed unity surpasses it, easily. The voice acting is great and the charecters are Memorable. I see Arnos storyline going 3 games deep for sure, all the charecters have a unique background fleshing out the story. Also the complexity of the story has never been such as the one in ACU. I think it's truly quite stellar of a game with only a few minor flaws.",

Comparing the old titles (not counting Black Flag here) to this, is like comparing a Ferrari 458 convertible to an american chrysler 200 convertible... Sure both are sports cars, and open convertibles - but the Ferrari has so much more finesse. The Chrysler 200 in comparison - well the parts hardly fit together, and looks like they were designed by a team of individuals not working together towards the end result.  The development/code of Assassin's creed: unity has the same 'we weren't really working as a team, rather as a bunch of individualists with specifications of individual parts' feeling to it. Maybe there was a team of architects working at one place, and a team of cheap developers working from across the globe?  Sure the graphics has been upped a bit; there is much more details to this game, the graphic designers definately was paying attention. Sound wise - the game also doesn't lack anything. But the coding... psscht.  There are bugs/glitches here and there, such as a guy with a pitchfork lifting hay up in the air, and then scattering it in a circle above his head, and the hay doesn't fall down - rather hovers up there, or one of the other bugs I found within the first couple of minutes of gameplay where I got stuck climbing, and couldn't move up or down - but had to restart the memory; but it's not the 'easy fixables' that's the wrongdoing of the game, which I can feel.  To gamers who has played the hitman series, they will know what I mean - by looking at the original Hitman titles which came out under IOI - compared to what happened once Eidos took control.

I brought Unity because I liked the predecessor and the new setting was interesting and the looks were impressive. In particular the large crowds. They really make the city feel alive. The level of detail of houses, their interiors, the streets is an eye catcher. Perfect to just walk about and enjoy the scenery.  However, I have had many graphic glitches. For instance characters completely in low-res textures standing right next to me. Low-res textures on objects here and there. Flickering inside buildings, like white dots on edges. Colored, glowing squares randomly appearing on the character in my character menu (this started after the second patch). And all this with a GTX 970 on ultra high settings.  I also experience game freezes every once in a while. I have no idea what causes them. After a few seconds, the game continues as normal. Very annoying.  I lost several hours of game play because it was not saved properly. The very same problem I once had in Black Flag. Apparently, it was not addressed in this game either. Lost game play is an absolute no-go. I suspect it has something to do with Uplay. Why I even have to have another additional software aside from Steam is beyond me. It's extremely annoying I have to run two different softwares to start a third software.  Regarding the lack of innovation. It was advertized that due to the lack of a ship like in Black Flag, the character itself would now be the focus and could be upgraded. This is true to a certain degree. The available upgrades consist almost entirely of abilities which the character of Black Flag had from the very beginning of the game. In Unity, however, I have to unlock them with points I receive from the main quest. For instance, in Black Flag I could blend in by sitting down on a bench next to an NPC. The very same ability in Unity has to be unlocked first. Throwing money on the ground to cause a distraction; in Black Flag a free ability, in Unity I have to unlock it. Plus, one has to buy money pouches to throw them away. Doesn't make any sense to me. In short, they did not add a substitute for the missing naval action and abilities. Instead they just cut the whole thing and simply made already existing abilites unlockable. That's no innovation at all; it's two steps backwards.  Then there are the controls. I took me a while to get used to the Black Flag controls, but then it was fun and I could get everywhere very fast and easy. The controls changed and are now more complicated but without benefit. When I'm in Free Run and want to get over a table, for example, I have to hold B in addition to the left stick and RT. In Black Flag I don't have to push any additional button to get over or under obstacles; it was cool and smooth movement. To just run on roofs and jump from house to house is less enjoyable and less easy now. I often get stuck somewhere. Stop right infront of a wall instead of climbing it, stay on the edge of a roof instead of jumping to the next, or jumping from a view point to my death instead of doing one step forward to the sync point. The controls are certainly not as smooth as in the last game.  The fighting system has changed too. Enemies are greater threats now when they have higher level and come in larger numbers. This is a good thing in my opinion. Unfortunately, the controls come into play here. On several occasions I was fighting and had to parry an attack. An indicator shows when best to do that. I hit B when the indicator was showing and nothing happened. Several other times the same thing occurred. Hitting B repeatedly doesn't help. My input was simply ignored. As a result I died several times, even though I would not have if not for the controls. It makes fights much less enjoyable and I don't have the feeling of being this highly trained, deadly assassin.  The story is ok from what I can tell so far. I hope there will be a few (positive) surprises waiting for me further down the story line and I definitely hope there is not so much of this Abstergo stuff. At least this is better than in Black Flag. There it was a hassle every time when I was pulled out of the Carribean and put into a dull company setting with sluggish controls.  Perhaps I'll get used to the changes at some point, even though I will still miss my ship. I won't be buying the next AC so fast and I don't recommend Unity at this point. The game came out 4 days ago, there are already 2 patches out and there are still many bugs and glitches. Not worth it.",

I didn't think AC3 benefited from being able to carry a whole arsenal with you. -Not everyone will love multiplayer missions, but I really do. I think they add an interesting extra level to standard missions. I like the added variety to the single player missions too. Love the murder mysteries!  Cons: -While I'm glad they got rid of the counter kills, I REALLY miss being able to disarm/ pick up weapons. -General lack of optimization/lag that has led to some really frustrating deaths in multiplayer, and even seems to crop up in single player at times.",

In Unity you play as Arno Dorian through Paris in the 1780s during the french revolution. A wonderful view of the city is seen around every corner. Whether you're looking at the old church of Notre Dame, or just witnissing the crowds gather and sing and yell for a change. I do believe I sat in Versailles watching people get executed for 10 entire minutes.   The story mode can be challenging in some portions, big fights make life difficult so the classic Assassin's Creed stealth requirement is returned because you want to do your best to avoid these massive 6-to-10 on 1 fights. Gameplay is quick and exciting as Arno proves he can do many more things than Ezio, Connor, and Edward. Climbing is faster, combat is faster (and cooler I might add).   Side missions and Side puzzles are in numerous variations and levels of difficulty all around Paris. I am not that good at Puzzles but if you are any more intelligent than me (which isn't hard to do mind you) then take a crack at it. Where I love the gameplay most is Co-op missions.  I'm hooked up with anywhere between 1 and 3 other assassin's where we tackle missions together in the coolest ways possible. I never thought I would ever see such badassery when we plan a mission perfectly and pull of the sweetest combos. Every mission is just like the trailer I promise you. Nothing feels better than running into a room with 3 other badasses and taking out a room of 16 guards so swiftly and easily. You won't be able to press F12 fast enough to catch it all!  I won't even get into all the customisation features to make your very own Arno look far better than any other Arno, representing your class and playing type the way you want to.  I would highly recommend Assassin's Creed Unity to anyone who is new to Asssassin's creed, and to anyone that has followed the series from the beginning.",

            "review_text": "This is the first AC game I couldn't bring myself to finish. I liked most of AC1, a LOT of AC2, nearly all of Brotherhood, much less of Revelations, a small chunk of AC3, most of AC4 and loved Rogue.   Though none of the games in the series are perfect Unity definitely flies furthest from that goal with an insane amount of bloat and zero polish. I tried to play the game twice, both well after initial release. The first time after just finishing Rogue and the second time months later after I felt like I could really get myself into an AC game again. Both times I stopped with the thought 'what's the point?'   To me, Assassin's Creed has always been my go to game to scratch an itch. An itch to complete. In a way, I treat AC games like a project where my goal is to reach that satisfying 100% feeling - starting from being a moderately badass assassin into a full blown super killing machine, collecting thingy-ma-bobs, looting chests, running rooftops, capturing territories and killing waves of fools in ultimate style. Unity definitely doesn't lack things to do, but absolutely destroys any fun in doing them.  Side content is more plentiful and more pointless than ever with most chests and side-missions providing scraps of money for completing them and little more than a couple of lines of NPC dialogue to go with the latter. The Murder Mystery and Nostradamus missions were more enjoyable to solve (provided you didn't look up solutions online) but again provided lackluster rewards. Often the game would tell me to upgrade my gear before attempting a mission that gave me... the same level of gear recommended to complete it. You can, of course, ignore these warnings about gear level and complete these missions anyway, but even if the gear you get is better than you current stuff it won't matter for very long, which brings me onto my biggest problem with Unity.  Balance. It's all ♥♥♥♥ing over the place (excuse my french, hoho). Unity seems to have attempted to revamp it's equipment system to work more along the lines of looting-focused games or MMORPGs every bit of equipment is given a rating out of 5 'stars' which determine it's general tier of usefulness. Armour pieces even have some more interesting stats tied to them like running noise or extra ammunition carrying which should, in theory, allow some personalisation of style. The problem is that the progression of this gear is entirely botched. A few hours into the game I'd bought a '4-star' weapon and was one shotting every guard in sight (while before I was being pleasantly challenged by large groups of enemies).   Moreover, despite this wide array of gear promoting personal playstyle it seems Unity actually provides fewer combat tools than ever to change up the way you play. Combat in AC games has never been difficult, but at least each new release gave me a few more ways to kill my enemies efficiently or stylishly. Changing from using a sword to a short dagger, then disarming a polearm dude and sweeping the guy with the big axe off his feet then smashing someone's head in with a counter attack and finally throwing a knife into back of that cowardly guard that tried to run was FUN. You could certainly make the combat boring by just holding the counter button down but the point is being 'better' at the game meant being a cooler killing machine. In Unity, I hit people until their health bar hits 0 then try not to hit them again so i have to watch the same finishing animation regardless of the weapon I chose - all while rolling about like a maniac trying to get close enough to the guy who's decided to walk back and shoot me.   It's easy to see the scope that Ubisoft wanted to achieve with Unity. Hundreds of weapons, armour pieces, side-missions, coop, hiests, and a massive realistic city. But it feels like no one actually sat down and played it, because Unity doesn't feel like a fun game with endless content. It feels like a chore, wading through endless unpolished content, hoping to see light at the end of the tunnel and be done with all this crap clogging up my experience.  All I can say is that I'm glad I never played before they patched out the need for using the companion app or their 'initiates program' because 'social' chests in AC4 were already rubbing me the wrong way. It's weird because Ubisoft all but scrapped the modern day gameplay in Unity (I actually liked those sections, by the way) but instead of focusing on the history and story they spent all their time moving that modern day gameplay into actual annoying IRL rubbish. Something which no one ever asked for, and as I'm sure they know now, no one likes.",

On the good side, we have decent combat mechanics, when the AI doesn't spam bullets, which is far better then the past few games. The new fighting style of perfect parring makes the combat fluid, and they mostly got rid of the Arkham combat style (slow and bulky, like you are Marvel's Juggernaut without the unstoppablity). Unfortunatly, the new parkour system frequently messes up, resulting in Arno jumping to the ground, jumping over or under your inteded target. Arno himself is more interesting than Conner of AC3, but still has minimal character development. As I am currently on the 11 segment of ACU, I feel justified saying that French Cardboard Man stays an arrogant little child for the duration of the game, which is the exact problem I always had with Native American Cardboard Man (Conner). The implementation of Co-op really helped this title have weight, as I spent several hours screwing around in missions with random players, however the constant breaking does get annoying. In the game, Abstergo finds you when you are in the Animus home entertainment thingy, forcing you to migrate servers. This gives you a chance to parkour through Paris to find an exit, without passerbys messing your flow up. That is, until they introduce the flashing red lines, which signify gliches (fake glitches). As someone who has never suffered from a flashing lights, my eyes would start burning during these segments, even if i had just started playing. If you are sezure prone, get a friend to play these parts. Over all the game is maybe worth a 4/10, with my bad experiances outnumbering my good. With a good combat system, you are able to bypass the crappy stealth parts, and combat is enjoyable again, like in the AC2 saga. Get this game heavily discounted. at $20, it can given decent funs. This game is still a massive disappointment after AC4BF, with the best parts of AC4BF being absent. Buy at your own risk.

It's still obvious there are a lot bugs not graphics related but most aren't game breaking, those that are come rarely.  Story: The story is solid, nothing spectacular or new, but it's solid and the characters are just interesting enough to finish the story.   City: Huge and Deep. This is the highlight, the city is huge and with the inclusion of interiors there is a lot more added depth to every aspect.  Gameplay: Stealth and parkour have been tweaked for the better overall, still some trouble jumping through windows while free running but now that going down is just as easy as going up movemnet through the city is easier.  Co-Op: Great, the only downside is that it may be difficult to find people for particular missions, but there is usually a mission available whenever.   Notes on older reviews: The App and external programs aren't required anymore to get anything in game. So from the start there are a ton of chests and goodies available.   Overall: If you are a fan of the series it's definately worth it if you think you can run it. If you aren't it's not a bad place to start, but you might prefer to get it on sale if it's not your kind of game. 7/10 mostly negative due to poor design around apps and rushed buggy delivery, but those have been fixed (for the most part)  Original June 7 2015:  Short: Bugs, better have a great PC, if not play Rouge.  Long: Over 6 months later it's still a buggy mess. A game should at least be able to run at 30 fps on the lowest settings with the min requirements. If you aren't sure if your PC will run it, it probably won't, and if it does, not really well. If you've invested in the latest and greatest or just happen to have a setup they optimized for than good for you, no sarcasm, please enjoy. The rest of us are going to have to wait until they fix the remaining bugs.  I'm not bashing on the game itself, or even Ubisofts developers, if anyone is to blame it's the producers who try to push games out in annual cycles not understanding the hurdles of good programming. I waited for a good sale before I finally bought the game, and only because it was with AC Rouge. AC Rouge is the game you want if you aren't sure about specs, it's not anything revolutionary gameplaywise for the series but the story is great and the gameplay is solid.  AC Unity is beautiful though. even with medium and low graphic setting there is a lot of detail, I think there in lies the problem, too many resurces are spent on things not wholey necessary, and it drags down FPS even at the lowest settings. I can play it with the same FPS at the highest setting, the only difference are the visuals. I'm usually not even picky about FPS, I'm cool with a consistent 20, but this game isn't consistent enough to make me comfortable.   So yeah, I'm taking a break from this game, hopefully they continue to patch it and it improves within the next 3 months. I don't mind waiting for a better PC or for them to patch it, but if they don't I likely won't buy any future games they release in this state.",

I say only half decent because there is two stories being told, one a revenge/romance, the other the assassin's vs. templars. Guess which one drags the game down (it's the templar half of the story). I honestly would have been so much happier if I did not have to listent to bad guys prattle on about their awesome society after I killed them. \\  The giant elephant in the room for this game is the performance and I'll be honest about it. It's not great, if you have below a 680 graphics card, do not buy this game. But I have a 780 and an ultrawide monitor and was able to run it at 30-60fps consitently.

Added crouching for stealth, but removed whistling, hiding underwater and moving bodies. Added the ability to quickly move downwards, but give you areas with so much clutter that you're constantly getting stuck to them. Made combat take a bit more thought than just constant countering, but then removed the ability to shield yourself against gunfire.  The character advancement is a mess, with little indication of what, exactly, the stats on your equipment do. You'll get equipment rewards from the main plot that are garbage compared to things you can buy from doing just a few sidequests. The map is littered with chests that you can't open until you max out the Lockpicking skill, but you can't tell that you can't open them until you actually get close. The less said about the Nomad stuff, the better, and Initiates has been ridicuously buggy. It still hasn't given me credit for other games in the series, even though elsewhere in the same system it notes that I've beaten them.  The setting is irrelevant for more than half of the main plotline, as is Arno's membership in the Assassins. The plot does nothing to advance the overall plot of the series. I didn't run into the craziest of the bugs (missing faces, etc.), but I've had multiple crashes, and could not get the unique assassination on one of the missions because an NPC kept walking into a wall, breaking his script.  I'd recommend avoiding this. Even if you're a big fan of the series, you won't actually miss any plot development.",

I have a rig that runs games like The Witcher 3, Battlefield, 4, Far Cry 4, etc. on highest settings with perfect 60+ FPS, and I barley scratch 40 on this, with dips to 25. Not to mention the constant crashing... Still, it's better than the 12FPS and inability to launch 9/10 times that there was on launch. Still not recommending.   For gameplay, Unity is a pretty enjoyable game. New climbing mechanics and traversion controls - albeit a little unpolished - allow for more of the climby-jumpy-runny-stabby gameplay of the Assassin's Creed franchise. The world feels more alive too; you can properly go inside buildings, and this adds a whole new level of depth. As for stealth, it's alright, same as the other games really. Cover and hiding and escaping work just fine, except the 'Press E for takedown' is very unresponsive, at least for me. Combat is a little more fluid yet more basic, back to ACB stlye. Plot is what you'd expect from an AC game: an era of history altered and dramatised with Assassins and Templars woven into it to create a need for bad-♥♥♥ hoods and robes. One thing that breaks the plot a bit is that EVERYONE has an English accent. Everyone. This game is made in Canada, yet they couldn't find anyone with a French accent? But gameplay itself really is pretty good.  Such a shame you can't play it. Overall, the game is pretty good. It's fun, it's got depth, and it's got a steady set of new mechanics and Co-Op is an interesting new feature (when it works). Still, Not recommended . Ubisoft has f***ed people around too long, and now they've pulled some crap about a new game next year being announced. 'Oh, so this game is broken? Let us work on a new one while we neglect to fix the old one.' D**kheads. As for the game itself, it's really not too bad, when it works. But I just can't encourage people to shovel out money to greedy, selfish developers. Stay well away from Unity until all issues are fixed; maybe then it will be worth whatever sale price it's on. I reccomend you play the game, but not buy it (I hope you get what I mean). I wouldn't give your money to these guys.",

I know the majority may not agree with me, and I certainly am not trying to say that Ubisoft and everything they put out is perfect but as a die hard fan of the franchise since the beginning I have to say I was satisfied with the game. And I think it is important to note that they recognized that they messed up with the release of Unity and responded with an apology AND made the first DLC free, which contained a whole new sequence, a new city to explore, and a variety of weapons to use in the game and I think that that's wonderful.   As for the series itself I know many people are saying it is the same game over and over again, and I think that the Far Cry series may begin to suffer from that as well, but I can look past that. While each Assassin's creed game at it's core is pretty much the same, I feel like there is always enough of whatever is new in the game to keep me entertained. For instance Unity changed the combat again, it is the same mechanics but it is much harder than any other AC game before, you cannot take on an entire army of soldiers, you can comfortably take on around 2-3, any more gets really hard. (Unless you have the special sword at the end). Bottom line is, Ubisoft has given us quite the Franchise, a Franchise that can go in so many ways and directions, there are so many time periods left unexplored that have so much potential, and i want to see those periods explored and I want to see where the series goes, provided Ubisoft avoids the problems that they have had in the past.   In my honest opinion, I think that Ubisofts biggest problem is that they are supposedly always working on two AC games at once, one at Montreal's studio and one somewhere else (I forgot they have a lot of offices i think). And I think that causes dissorginization within the company and that they should relax, take there time, and put games out there more slowely so that they themselves have time to reflect on the feedback from the previous game. Bottom line is I am really hoping that Syndicate puts them back on the rise, and addresses all the complaints the fans have had up to this point. I hope the series stays succesful.",

Also, random NPC drop in, so watch out for that! One women scared me so much when she appeared right in my face. Anyway, bad bits over. The game is beautiful and amazing and looks very realistic. A sort of 'L.A. Noire' feel to the mouth movements as the actions are very good and match very well to the voice acting. There isn't too much frame rate drop either, even when there is a scene with over 100 NPC's, it ran perfectly.  The bugs: Okay, so there are still a few bugs and the climbing of buildings is not perfect on the Xbox controller, and far more accurate on the keyboard and mouse for me. The bugs are still there and sometimes noticable but lets just say, Ubisoft learn't there lesson with this one and it damaged pre-order sales of Rogue. The storyline is fairly good but lacks the modern day feel but the sequel to Syndicate is suppose to incorporate the modern day again and in a better light. If you are a fan of the Assassins Creed series then I would say buy it in a sale. (At time of writing it is 50% off (Obama - Not Bad)) and that makes it worth its money - not the full price.

Other issues would be down to Arno deciding to grab onto a wall or decides to get stuck on a chair and refuses to get down at all this was especially annoying when trying to actually escape from a horde of police or guards from chasing me.  The next issue I have was the many many collectables in this games 294 chests and 128 cockades far too many collectables that when your forced to play a lockpicking minigame made the chest hunt so much more of a slow grind that made the game unnecessary long. The collectables take me back to the first Assassins Creed which was more of a collectable grind as well. I can forgive the annoying random crowd events, but the collectable stuff was just a absolute punishment.  One of the good points was the pretty motion capture and the story wasn't that bad, though I would of liked more of the present day story to actually be in the game, yes I am one of the few who actually enjoyed the present story and the Desmond storyline.   So my final point is you could probably miss this game or if you want to really need to play it don't pay the 40.00 euro and just wait for it to go on sale instead, this game isn't really worth the asking price especially with the bad bugs and constant crashes, Since the majoraty of the game time was collecting these items when the main story was at least twelve hours.",

When I heard about all the issues, I told myself I would pay no more than $20 for this game. I got the game for $16, and I feel like I still paid too much for it. This is the worst put together Assassin's Creed game I have played (I've played all the main ones up to this point, including Rougue), and after getting about half way through the main story, I don't think I am interested in ever playing Assassin's Creed Syndicate. There are probably too many points to hit, but I'll discuss the ones that seem the most bothersome.  - Free running does not flow as well as it use to. The free run up and down feature was a nice touch, but what you consider to be ascend, descend, or static running may not be the same as the game's idea. I kept getting stuck in places that I would never have a problem with in previous AC games  - Everyone has guns and everyone is a perfect crackshot with them. Each bullet takes about a third of your health (even with decent armor loadout), and you will be shot by someone off map and die a lot. The combat in general just seems a bit unfair. Either Arno is the worst assassin ever, or Ubisoft made the combat too steep.  - The interface constantly interferes with gameplay. I completed a mission but was surrounded by enemies when it did, and I died because the combat does not work properly until you close the end-mission dialogue box. Hints would pop up over other dialogue boxes, making you wait for them to go away before reading information on side quests and such. May not seem like a big deal, but it happens enough to become super annoying.  - The camera in combat is awful. In older AC games, the camera would automatically adjust to keep enemies on screen. Now it just sits there and you have to move it manually like you do outside of combat. This leads to many enemies being off screen and attacking you without much warning. With the combat already being unfair, this just adds more frustration.  - Although many of the bugs have been fixed, there are still a lot in the game. I constantly get stuck in walls and have the either fast travel or wait to be shot to death to escape. I died more times from bugs than I'd like to admit on any game.  - The main story has not really been about the French Revolution at all. I'm only half way through the story, so maybe the game does get more involved with what is going on at the time, but half way in it has just been it's own seperate story that happens to take place in Paris during the time of the French Revolution. In AC3, you at least are somewhat a part of the American Revolution (Boston Massacre, Battle of Chesepeke Bay), and in AC4 you pirate with Blackbeard in some missions. The big advertising for Unity was the French Revolution, but the assassin order does nothing to take part. This story could be copied and pasted into any historical time and not change. Again, have not finished the main story, but so far, nothing  I have been a fan of the franchise since the first Assassin's Creed game. I knew this one had some problems when it first came out, but after a year, I approached it with an open mind and was very let down. If you are a fan of the series, proceed with caution. If you are new to the series, I recommend staying away and trying AC2.  4/10",

I just finished the introduction scenes. so my impression is only about the first part, but confirmes the overall mixed feeling of the reviews,  This game has the elements we know of the other AC games. I love the fact that it is in Paris. But when starting the game, you will quickly see there are lots of game bugs. In the opening scenes, i actually needed to switch resolution various times, sothat a door would open.... major bug that is is not fixed... in the opening scene! how can you miss that, after all the updates?  Be prepared for some frustration because of lots of map glitches, and bugs i guess...  Downvoted because as the top commenter mentioned, this game feels like an early access game.  ***Edit*** On the otherhand, if you see all the horrible bugs as another metagame, it is quite fun to play and get to the end of the storyline, having to reset videocards, rebuilding gamecache, just to be able to play etc.... So, it is playable, but only if you are prepared to search for the bug fixes.",

It demands alot, but if your computer can handle it it is a well-detailed, decently functioning game. It has some interesting new side activities (murder mysteries for instance, though these can occasionally be less than satisfying).   It also fixed a lot that was wrong with the previous titles. Arno is the first Assassin who can free run down buildings, a much needed development. He can also crouch and hide behind objects (properly). These are skills you might have expected to appear in the franchise earlier on.   My complaints though, are not technical. The characters in this game failed to intruigue and excite me like they had in it's predecessor 'Blag Flag'. To be quite honest, I couldn't care less about Arno. Not to mention the landscape is bleak and repetitive. The story is mediocre, and at times difficult to keep up with.   I have not played the multiplayer feature very much, and don't feel able to comment on that.  If you're committed to the franchise. I would recommend this game. But I would certainly rate it one of the poorer titles in the Assassin's Creed collection",
