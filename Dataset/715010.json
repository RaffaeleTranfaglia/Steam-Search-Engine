    "minimum_requirements": "OS: Windows 7 (maybe xp) Processor: Somewhat modern Dual Core should do the trick Memory: 2 GB RAM Graphics: 512MB Video Card at least Storage: 500 MB available space Additional Notes: I'd be very surprised to learn if Diamo XL didn't run on your computer. I wouldn't be surprised if someone could get it running on one of those new-fangled smart fridges. Really though... smart fridge... who needs that?",
    "recommended_requirements": "OS: Windows 10 Processor: What comes after Octa Core? Do Quantum processors exist yet? Memory: 16 GB RAM Graphics: 4x SLI GeForce GTX 1080 TI (Can that be done?) Storage: 501 MB available space Sound Card: Can you still buy these? Am I going to get hate mail for even suggesting that? If you can buy these, you should probably get the best one because what's better than the best? Additional Notes: Give a man a fish and feed him for a day. Don’t teach a man to fish… and feed yourself. He’s a grown man, fishing’s not that hard.",
