            "review_text": " Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition  is a frenzied, artistic action game that, though it is marred by slight technical difficulties, still provides an enjoyable alternative to the standard action-sandbox.   Sleeping Dogs ' greatest strength comes from its presentation. The developers implemented the game's open-world replica of Hong Kong painstakingly with striking visuals and smartly interconnected layouts, which help the player see this beautifully-realized city from all angles. The characters' presentations are also done in an effective manner. The effort put into the story of the main character especially pays off, as gamers can easily identify with the upbringing and struggles that drive development of protagonist Wei Shen as he searches to define himself between connections with the Hong Kong Police and the gang Sun On Yee. Wei is joined by a cast of secondary characters that would generally fall into the category of 'stereotypical', but fortunately most have some extraordinary developments or twists that keep them from becoming stale or predictable.  Comparisons between  Sleeping Dogs  and the  Grand Theft Auto  series are commonplace. However, such claims made in an attempt to denigrate  Sleeping Dogs  is, at best, ignorant. Martial arts motifs play a significant role in the design of the gameplay here, composing the greatest difference between this and GTA. The player lacks the GTA-standard arsenal of weapons to carry around as combat is largely focused on hand-to-hand combat. Though some later levels heavily feature guns, players will largely find themseleves using combos and counters to dispatch foes. Other mechanics, ranging from a unique on-the-road hijack system to genre-standard slow-motion sequences further reinforce the kung-fu movie feel that the game is going for.   Sleeping Dogs  suffers from an array of technical malfunctions and limitations. The game in general works appropriately (no issues with rendering or framerate), though on rare occasion it crashed with no warning. Because the game generates cutscenes and scripted actions in the real game environment (i.e. instead of cutscenes being full video, the background of the scene is a continuation of what is going on with NPCs in the open world), unintended consequences often result. These consequences range from the hilarious (two characters showing indifference after being run over during a cutscene) to the catastrophic (being stuck behind an invisible wall after a scripted event, requiring reset). Getting stuck is moreso an issue with platforming in this game, as it attempts to emulate  Assassin's Creed 's parkour system, only to provide an unrefined version, leaving many instances of floating above objets or glitching around walls where one shouldn't be. Finally, the overreliance on the counter mechanism during combat makes it difficult to fight off groups of enemies as the game cannot handle many targets to counter at once. This proves especially troublesome during the beginning of the game, when Wei is too weak to take most attacks and must abuse the counter, leading to some unfair situations. This becomes less of an issue as he grows stronger in the game.  In spite of this variety of issues the game faces, it was never enough to outweigh the positive experience that playing this game provided. It offers a lengthy primary campaign, bolstered by sidequests, completion goals and simple-yet-fun minigames. The  Definitive Edition  provides a significant amount of bonus missions and accessories to effectively bolster the length of the game after beating the main game. Additionally, it provides two scenarios seperate from the main game to play, which are both worthwhile in their own right. Though the final result of the game faced faulty implementation due to what the game was trying to accomplish, it still succeeds in providing a more visually-enthralling, narrative driven experience than is normal for action sandbox titles, and is a worthy game in any collection.  Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition  gets a B.",

            "review_text": "I'll start this by saying that I've really enjoyed this game. A good mix between GTA and Saints Row. Story is cliche but engaging at the same time, although I was really hoping that there would be multiple endings at the end (it seemed like the story was leading to that). The game's story had the potential to top GTA's if they had put in multiple endings.  GTA should do collectables like how Sleeping Dogs did it. The problem with GTA's collectables is that they had no value to it. Sleeping Dogs gave you upgrades for completing collectables. Thus, giving you the reason to go hunting them down.  Combat system is one of the best for this genre, forcing you to use martial arts instead of going in guns blazing (not true for all missions, as the last few missions were gunfights). And note that I said 'for this genre'. Combat is definately not as good as the Batman series or Shadow of Mordor. And the chase scenes are amazing, as the freerunning system is simple but engaging at the same time.  Problems only come in when you're trying to get all achevements and 100% the whole game. Bugs start to show, and I had to restart missions multiple times (sometimes even the whole game). Missions became tedious to do. At this point, the game got frustrating and I was playing it for the sake of completion. But this all started after the 25-30 hour mark.  DLCs were mostly meh... 'Nightmare in North Point' was OK. You would probably enjoy 'Year of the Snake' if you really enjoyed the police missions in the main game.  TL;DR Main story cliche but good. Brings new mechanics to the table for this genre. DLCs are meh. Game can become tedious and frustrating when trying to 100% it. Highly recommended.  BTW, always remember, 'A man who never eats pork buns is never a whole man.'",

There's a few times where you can fail a mission randomly due to bad AI (ie: if you have an ally driving for you and they flip the car) or just some inexplicable auto-fails. Nonetheless, the concept of the game is very appealing and is mostly well done. It doesn't have the same polish as GTA in some ways but the martial arts combat system and parkour is way more advanced than what GTA has. One terrible thing in this game is that you can't seem to hail a cab without car jacking half the time. Nobody thought of using another button for the car jacking? Bugs and minor headaches aside, it's definitely a buy if you haven't played the original version and love games like GTA and Saints Row.",

            "review_text": "Cool game, lovely voice work and great graphics. The environments are nice and the combat is fun. However there is one thing that I cannot shake when I play this and it is very irritating. It feels like a poor man's GTA. Driving vehicles is no fun either, mostly because when using a mouse and keyboard, the camera is awkward. Reversing on a bike will spin the camera, but if you manually move the mouse to get a better look as you set off forward, it will still rotate the camera and as such go beyond the forward view - as if it has to complete the entire motion. Why they couldn't of made it so moving the camera view yourself resets the camera spin, I just don't know.  There are are a few other minor annoyances. Sometimes AI will walk into things, which isn't that bad really and many games are guilty of that (ahem Payday 2), but one of my biggest gripes when playing on foot is that there is no toggle for walk and run. Instead, if you want to walk you must rely on holding the free aim button (which is right click by default). However using free aim to walk is evidently not the proper way of doing it because whenever you get near an interactable object that you wish to talk past, your guy will just... sort of strafe past it while trying to get it in focus. Bit daft really that they couldn't simply add a walk toggle button.  Another annoyance? The weird buttons. The game plays brilliantly with mouse and keyboard, but I have no idea why some menus rely solely on pressing Left-CTRL and Right-CTRL and Backspace and Enter. Why couldn't a cursor be implemented? Seems a bit lazy if you ask me.  Overall, of what I've played (among some other very minor bugs which I've decided not to mention here), the game is excellent and well worth the money if you haven't already got the base game. For those who have the original Sleeping Dogs, I wouldn't necessarily say the increase in graphical fidelity and draw distance was worth it... although that is ultimately your decision.  ",

Sleeping Dogs is the epitome of take two steps forward and three steps backwards, hopefully SE will decide on making a sequel and address many of the issues that keep Sleeping Dogs from being a masterpiece.   +Great Graphics +Great setting and story +Good fighting mechanics +Plenty of action sequences +Lots of side missions +Good voice actors  -Poor racing missions, especially bike races -Questionable vehicle handling -Many bugs and occasional crashes -Poor gunplay -Frustrating missions -Useless weapons especially guns  There are many questionable design flaws in Sleeping Dogs which really don't help the game, such as several highly useless abilities like access police weapons from the trunks of police cars, alls this does is immediately start a police chase, not that the guns will help you since they'll disappear if you interact with the world - yes, you heard that currently since SE constantly defend the fact that this is a melee based game, they state that guns are a 'power-up' but that doesn't explain why if I use a health shrine or open a box, or do anything other than shoot the gun will mysteriously disappear - this renders all the DLC that have bonus weapons completely useless.   Hong Kong looks great - plenty of eye candy all around but even so, SE fails to go beyond that - the character customization is limited, clothing is limited with few giving XP or special boosts. Car customization is non-existant which is a shame and doesn't really make that much sense since a large portion of content revolves around illegal street racing, which brings up another major issue - the racing is exceptionally poor, the car races are 100% based on picking the correct car for the race, its as simple as that - whilst the bike racing is mind blowing bad, your rival racers seem to ride ungodly powerful bikes that go significantly faster, have insanely perfect handling around tight spaces and have godly acceleration, the only chances the player has to win the bike races is to have the best bikes and to drive the race with perfection, no crashes, no drift errors - as your rivals will slow down at certain parts allowing you to get in front, and then catch just as quickly.   In closing, whilst I'm giving this a recommedation, this game does have its issues so I would rather give it a mixed review rather than a purely postive one. I would say this game is worth a purchase if on sale or cheap but be aware of potential issues.",

Yup... and you can be sure that my psycho-side was in full force when I played this. I just couldn't help myself. XD  It's basically a sandbox crime game, but with the added twist of you sometimes doing sandbox stuff where you punch crime instead. Or taze it. Or shoot it. Or arrest it. Or... yeah not continuing this. Anyway, there's lots of side missions, collectibles, places to explore, minigames, and citizens to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of when they make rude remarks about your clothes, hit you with their car, or just simply exist. Honestly, I didn't need reasons to act like a total sociopath (even moreso than I do in the Saints Row games, which is really saying something), so I had a tendency to act like one...  ...except during alot of missions when it actually has negative effects. Basically you have three leveling systems: Police (which you get xp for by obeying the law and punching criminals on police missions), Triad (for punching people or slamming their head into... woah that was uncalled for), and Face (for helping people, which I find funny since pride pretty much never involves being a benefactor). It's pretty obvious which of these three leveling systems I didn't get much XP for. The minigames were kinda silly, particularly that karaoke stuff and the whole collecting girl phone numbers thing (which I never called because I never got  that  bored). At least the combat is pretty good.  There is a story, and it's actually pretty good. At times predictable, and I often felt as if my main character was being way too antagonistic towards his police handler. But it's good. Also its crazy-violent, because gangsters who talk about codes and honor are the last people to actually respect such things. And while I was not torn at all about whose side I was on (because Triad people are scum), I did cheer a few times when they did stuff I wanted them to do, such as when the character I hated the most (because he pulled a Walder Frey, which made me think about the 'RW' and all that comes with that) ended up being killed by a crazed lady feeding him one of his henchmen and chopping him with a meat cleaver. And while that was certainly satisfying, it wasn't one of the  many  ideas I had between the 'Hong Kong RW' and that scene about what way I would have ended that guy (or Walder Frey). I had an alarming tendency to ponder what outrageous act of violence I wanted to see end the lives of certain characters, most of which were more brutal than what actually happened. I really must be a psycho. &gt;_&lt;  Anyway... sandbox crime, violence, betrayal... all that horse-♥♥♥♥. There isn't really anything new here, and while I certainly prefer other games (like the Saints Row series) for this type of fun, this is alright. So I guess that's a 'yes' from me.  Yey.",

First of all, the story, characters and leveling system are all top-notch ; one starting with max EXP, and getting less as you commit crimes (Such as property damage and injuring civilians), And the other starting at min EXP, as most leveling systems do, and getting more with the more illegal actions you do. These add to create an interesting blend between each skill tree.  Each story mission is varied and interesting (With the exception of a couple of starting missions, but hey, they were never fun.)  The DLCs are okay, but the main game is where it really shines. MUCH LIKE THE RAIN PHYSICS IN THIS GAME MY GOD I LOVE THEM THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL AND ACTUALLY RAIN-LOOKING.  The parkour system is fun and fluid, although the idea to make the SPRINT button the same as the button to climb stuff was... less than intelligent.   There are literally HUNDREDS of collectibles to find and grab; some giving you new combat skills, outfits and access to cameras around Hong Kong.  All the animations are realistic and just fun to look at.  There are a myriad of vehicles to use, ranging from the outrageous Super-fast bikes to the downright stupidly slow skrub cars you find on the street.

            "review_text": "Great Game with a great story line!  My opinions regarding the game:   You have to remember that you are in Hong Kong and they do drive on the left. Especially when you are not used to have cars go on the left but on the right in real life. How many times have I crossed the road to be plowed from behind? A mystery because I lost count after 100+.    I understand there are so many insurance frauds in the real world, but driving on the road and the car in front slams the brakes a great majority of the time for no reason gets frustrating.    The driving game camera could be better controlled especially when you need to reverse fast and move forward. The camera view becomes a real pain when it whips around when you get stuck with the car.    Should have a setting to select the radio station you wished to be default for your game or another option is to be able to add your own music folder as a radio station like GTA would be awesome.    A fast way to make a lot of money in the game, is to use 'Tran' car mini-quests from the cellphone. Can make a great deal of money in a short time, of course depended on the cars you obtain until completed all the requests.     A few other odd little annoyances like in all other games and that is it, it’s just a game but great game.   A trick for achieving the Social Hub “Gambler”:   If you go into “Statistics”, then “Completion”, it will show you the “Overall net gambling performance”. The stat tracker in the Social Hub will only take into account the highest of your overall performance has ever been and not what it is currently. The one in Social Hub will never go lower if you go on a losing streak, so you have to look into the “Statistics”, then “Completion”, will show you the “Overall net gambling performance” to find out.    This is why it isn't increasing in the Social Hub section. In “Statistics”, I was at -$24 500 for my Overall net performance, even though in Social Hub was stating that I had maximum of $215 000.    Follow the tips found online on so many sites in regards of achieving this by saving the game on wins and reload when you lose. Took about 30 minutes to accomplish this by reloading when was at North Point, walk until can grab a taxi to the vehicle store at the dock in Kennedy; steal the car behind when out of the taxi to drive the remaining section to the Kennedy ^Rooster fight.   Still a great game to play and challenging to try to obtain all the achievements!  P.S. the *Rooster was supposed to be written KCOC &lt;- written backwards, but it gets censored!",

This one could easily go toe to toe with the big fish like GTA.  Also sports the best car in a game I've seen. A crossover of the Knight Rider and a James Bond car.  The cons are negligible. The camera spazzes out occasionally, especially when performing Action Hijacks. The GPS can be a load of crap sometimes. In addition, money isn't a problem at all, unless you go for a completionist playthrough and want to buy all the cars and clothes. The main story DLCs are great, but very short (from around 40 minutes to 3 hours to complete). Also, they are significantly less serious in tone compared to the base game, which might be a drawback for some people.  That's all the cons I could think of.",

While the amount of side activities aren't as varied as GTA (No tennis or darts, for example), the amount of available side activities is fun on its' own.

Sleeping Dogs takes place in Hong Kong and the map is about as big as GTA IV.  You can traverse the map how you like: By Car, Bike, Foot, Boat. The biggest difference from GTA is that this is a more brawler-melee oriented game.  You learn and practice martial arts to take down your enemies - you find melee weapons and firearms in certain locations.  You play as an undercover cop who has a job to infiltrate the Triads and take them down from the inside. I don't know if you're aware of gangster life, but this ♥♥♥♥ is gritty and intense.  Definitely one of the most immersive storylines of 2012.  You have three reputations to choose to uphold: Cop, Triad and Face. You earn Cop by doing Cop missions, Triad by Triad missions, and Face by doing favors on the street. There is plenty to do so you will never be bored: Drag Races, Underground Fight Clubs, Murder Mysteries to solve - the game engine does an A+ job at making Hong Kong feel alive.  12/10 ________________________________________________________________________________  PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I ran down the street in my Sun Wukong outfit and some jerk hit me with his SUV.  I hijacked the nearest bike, caught up with him, stood on it's seat and jumped onto the hood of the SUV. I opened the driver-side door and threw my newly sworn enemy onto the rocky gravel below me to his death.  I drove into the sunset, satisfied with my new SUV. I drove the SUV into the Ocean.

If you do own the original, then, no, I wouldn't recommend it unless you like the look of enough of the DLC available that you don't already have that this will actually end up being cheaper than buying that DLC. Why do I say this? Well, the graphics, once you actually get them working right, do show improvement over the original, and the world feels a bit more populated, but the difference is more of a case of a minor nip and tuck, rather than a jaw-dropping overhaul, so it's not really worth even the discounted price for that alone.",

Now, while this isn't much of an issue, it did mess with my muscle memory a bit.   Anyways, Sleeping Dogs:DE is a great way to introduce yourself to the game, it comes with all the DLC, and as it should, has the base game which is pretty great. Sleeping Dogs' has intense combat with combos that feel good to execute similar to the Batman Arkham games, which are also pretty great. The story is fairly decent, and playing as a Undercover cop as a Triad Gangster is pretty entertaining.   Overall, Sleeping Dogs: DE (despite some minor preformance issues) gets a 7/10 'Pretty Good' I reccomend buying it during the next sale.",

Although it's enjoyable, it's not without it's bugs and annoyances, the main one for me being the world's worst parcour running. One minute you can run up a wall to grab a ledge, the next you can't jump over a waist high fence! I kept experiencing audio loops too, where a gunshot or explosion sound would loop until I exited the game.  Expansion wise, the nightmare DLC is pretty lame, and can be rattled off in about an hour and is very repetative. Don't go expecting anything on par with Red Dead Redemption's nightmare expansion. Zodiac Island (Enter the Dragon) is pretty cool, but again just over an hour. Year of the Dragon is pretty good too. Much of the other DLC was inventory items, collections, tweaks, etc.  All in all, I'd definately recommend buying this if you've never played it.

I'm running a top of the line machine and yet sometimes the counter doesn't go through and there's a delay when it comes to driving occasionally. On some occasions I've found some ghost feedback where it decides to drive me straight into a building. Great times on missions.  Story line is okay, but very redundant as it lacks diversity in a lot of areas. Graphically its pretty decent for when the game was released and the models in-game are very well designed. Driving becomes interesting as you'll default to the way you would normally drive and its reversed in the game.   Key bindings become slightly annoying depending on how you like to set them up. I'm particularly annoyed at the fact you can't assign counter as right mouse as when your in a vehicle it defaults the reight mouse to aiming a firearm. By assigning counter/use/interact as right mouse, when aiming it throws you out of the car.  Not a bad game overall but it definitely has some issues that become problematic occasionally.

I only played definitive so i am not sure what they added the game but i can say it's pretty solid game. Unlike other series this game is heavily on hand to hand combat rather then guns or tools. Driving gets a little time to adapt. Combat is amazing. Missions and side missions are fun to play. Integrated dlc missions is also fun to play. For the story at first i didn't like the idea of being a undercover cop (thought they will restirct my actions) it didn't matter and the story development was pretty good. But i think they could give a better feeling about Wei's pressure about being undercover or never mention it. Despite all that Wei Shen is a true man and you know why because he eats pork bun..",

It demonstrates exactly why the criminal lifestyle is bad without forcing it down your throat or completely jerking your chain like GTA4 does. You lose friends - emotionally and literally - you make enemies, you suffer, you bleed, you break, you hurt, and some things you just have to let go in order to live. Hong Kong is a beautiful and mean place, and you get to find out first-hand just how terrible it can be to be a gangster.  Visually and audibly this game is absolutely beautiful even despite the dicky optimization on PC, and its gameplay is so satisfying and free-feeling even when you're just blitzing main quests like I did my first time around. The first time you roll around the neon-lit Hong Kong at night while listening to chilled out electronic tracks on Ninja Tune will take your breath away, I guarantee it.   Story-wise, the story can be a BIT spotty, but it's hardly gaping with holes and it's easy to suspend your disbelief to understand them. The developers seemed to actually care about the fact that you might want to cut loose and plough through a shopping district sometimes after a hard mission, so you only get punished for murder through police attention and, if you're on a mission, reduced Cop XP rather than revoking money or XP retroactively.  The characters are also REALLY likeable and surprisingly memorable even with such a wide cast. You will learn to love Jackie Ma, you will learn to loathe Dogeyes, and you will learn to breathe like Wei Shen.  Hong Kong is a cruel place, but it's also a beautiful place. This game makes me want to visit it for real. Do not pass up your chance to play this, if you ever get it.",

Now, despite that bug and based on my very short time of playing, this seems pretty okay GTA-like. Nothing spectacular and there isn't the Saints Row kind of wacky freedom, but what works for me is how the game feels like a kung fu movie, and how some small touches that lack from other games like this help sell the illusion.  My advice is, buy this from a big sale and play for an hour, that is enough time for you to figure if you're going to enjoy this.",

            "review_text": "Sleeping Dogs was, is and always will be one of my favorite games. Before I review, note that the description is lying. It doesn't include all availaible DLC's. But it does include two major ones.   So you're probably wondering whether Sleeping Dogs has anything to do with sleeping dogs. Nope. Just like Watch_Dogs has nothing to do with watching dogs. It might be a tad boring that way. Just a tad. You play as an undercover cop named Wei Shen who's job and goal is to take down the notorious Triad Sun On Yee gang in Hong Kong. The story plays out really well and characters have good voice acting and are memorable.  If you haven't played the original (which is unfortunately not available anymore on PC) you wouldn't notice the difference in graphics. The only two noticeable changes I saw is the lighting and amount of people on the streets; which already makes for a much more fun experience as it makes Hong Kong feel much more alive. There are some minor annoyances but nothing game breaking. Cars and motorcycles pinball off of walls and other cars and sometimes combos and counters don't register. But it doesn't happen often. I very highly recommend this game as it delivers unique combat on foot and in cars. Which reminds me....to those of you patiently waiting for Arkham Knight, this will fill the whole for a bit as you can unlock (basically) the Chinese Batmobile. It will gain upgrades as you do more missions with it.  That's the end of my review. This paragraph is for those curious to gain knowledge past playing the game. Sleeping Dogs is based on true events. How true? That I don't know but I do know this. The fictious Sun On Yee gang is based on a real Triad gang called the Sun Yee On. And the 18K is based on the Sun Yee On's real arch rivals the 14K. Sun Yee On was founded in 1919 by a man named Heung Chin and currently has around 55,000 members around the world; which is supposedly the highest count among the Triads. The Triads control extortion, drug trafficking, gambling and prostitution. Which is basically everything you encounter in the game. Their favored weapon of choice is the cleaver; which you see plenty of in the game as well. The Triads do not give any mercy to traitors and rats. They do indeed torture their victims before killing them. The term 'red pole' is also a real term used and is actually not a huge deal within their structure. 'Red poles' are enforcers; just one step up from being regular members. Before you were even in the Sun On Yee you were considered a 'Blue Lantern' which is the uninitiated. The initiated and regular members are considered '49ers'.   The characters you see in the game are based off of actual people; but the names were changed to protect them. There is also a reason why Wei Shen came from San Francisco. The Triads were really noticed by the US in 1977 due to the 'Golden Dragon Massacre'. The attack resulted in 5 deaths and 11 wounded. 2 of which were tourists and the other 9 weren't gang members either. This event led to the creation of the 'San Francisco Asian Gang Task Force'.  People usually tend to think that videogames aren't educational and they teach you absolutely nothing. This is....the definitive way to prove those people wrong AHAHA....I'm sorry I couldn't resist. Now go enjoy being a sleeping dog for (San's) sake!",

In Sleeping Dogs, you are an undercover agent in some asian city posing as someone trying to get into the Triads. The story goes pretty stereotypically from there based on the Triad background, but it is so fun along the way.  The world size is pretty big, and the amount of things to do is pretty fun. I will also applaud the game for the focus on hand-to-hand combat mechanics rather than gun-play, as it makes it much more interesting most of the time. The graphics are really great, and the characters are voiced well, and have very good backstories and development for the most part. The driving is even done pretty damn well.  Overall the game is up there alongside a lot of other RPG's in it's class and holds it's own really well, given it's good execution and really, really unique setting and story for a RPG.",

Playing the game at 3840x2160 with maximum available settings, still provides mediocre visual fidelity in contrast to other titles. This title isn't as graphically demanding as it sets itself up to be; it is more the lack or proper PC hardware usage that cripples performance in most scenarios. The gameplay itself is where the core positives come from. A blend of Batman: Arkham series style combat, with a mixture of matial arts donates a hard hitting experience for hand to hand combat. Fire fights take a semi-cinematic path, with slow motion crossovers, and 'on the fly' environment interaction. The main city area itself has a large amount of content to explore, side missions to take part in, and police objectives to clear. The driving can feel out of place at times if you are in the wrong vehicle, although the action cameras and jumping from car to car provide options for changing that.   The Definitive Edition is another way of saying 'DLC.' That is what you get, the original copy of the game with all included DLC. If you are expecting a full 'remaster,' you will not find it here. Only subtle changes to the graphics have been applied, and more times than not, they are just additional effects to fill the empty spaces of the city.   I picked up the game at a massive discount, and I suggest you do as well. As years later, it is not worth anywhere near the full price they are requesting, and feels more like a 'cash grab' than anything else. Especially with the lackluster improvements to the core elements that make up Sleeping Dogs.   If you don't own the game, it is a good time sink between other games. You can't go wrong with a discount purchase.",

On some occasions. But no different than Excel or Chrome. I got this on sale some months back. Glad I did. And I'm using a computer that is 4 years old. I know some want more romance in the story (who wouldn't!) but considering who you are playing as, it makes sense why the only romance is between characters you meet. Overall a nice game.

Among the game's many positives are: Hong Kong culture, Triad culture, a great variety of soundtrack, a focus on martial arts instead of just shooting up everything, and an amazing story. The tension in the story comes from Wei Shen's equivocal position between being an undercover cop, and being a rogue who has a personal vendetta to dominate Hong Kong's underworld.   There are a few frustrating things about the game. If you're playing the PC version, the menus feel a bit laggy, and there are a couple of missions where counterattacks just do not register consistently (Death by a Thousand Cuts). Read the YouTube comments on this mission for hilarity. Another bug is when you throw a knife at someone, and it bounces off of them at high speed and instantly kills you (even from full health).   If there is one piece of advice I can give you, it is to look up what the fastest vehicles are for each type of race and to buy them, because some races are absolutely impossible to win without the right vehicle (try winning a B-class race with the HKPD SUV -- use the Terre GT instead) . In the races, the computer-controlled drivers will often ram you at the start (asian drivers), and if you find yourself being overtaken on a straightaway it's because you have an underpowered vehicle.   Another tip is to use the uniform that gives double cop XP for all of the missions that are colored blue. Even without the uniform, it is easiest to max out cop xp for the bonuses, almost as easy to max out face xp, and very difficult to max out Triad XP.   Other than trying to win races without buying the fastest vehicles, and the sometimes inconsistent fighting mechanics (laggy registers on counterattack timings), this game truly has an amazing story that should not be missed by anyone who is a fan of the open world GTA style games. Buy Asian GTA.",

A friends Chinese wife saw some screenshots of the game and started naming off the real life places that were represented in the game, such as the marketplace in the begining tutorial. As far as combat goes, there arent really too many guns, most of the combat will be through matial arts. There is even racing and Karaoke in the game. Ive played through the game a few times(Non Definitive Edition) and it was a blast each time. I would strongly recomend this game to anyone looking for a GTA style game but without the price.

At the time of writing this, I also have a little over 13 hours into this game(Despite having beaten it before buying it on Steam). That alone tells you how awesome this game is, Everything from it's incredible and exciting storyline to the street vendors' dialogue is as close to perfect as I've seen.  Pros: - The main storyline (All Sun On Yee-related missions) is like being in a really good action movie. That's the best way I can describe it. The writing, cinematography, and character development is spot-on. - The characters is this game feel like real people. The writing and voice acting is superb. This, both fortunately and unfortunately makes it easy to get connecting to a character. You'll understand why that's a 'bad' things when you play. - The environment of Hong Kong iss so many different great things. It's gritty, dirty, vibrant, bright, dark, beautiful, etc. It's what it needs to be when that is appropriate. You never feel out of place in this game unless the game wants you to feel out of place. Also, civilian dialogue in this game is great. It acts as a comic-relief and is probably my favorite thing about this game, other than the pork buns. - The combat in this game, both melee and armed, is great. Abviously it has a much more in-depth melee system, but the gunplay is fun and satisfying as well. I've always thought of the melee in this game as what The Batman: Arkham wanted to be. It's fluid, fun. and cool looking, but it's also challenging and requires more than button-mashing most of the time. You're also able to use several objectsin the environment like phone boothes, ovens, and hook to kill and dismember your opponents, which is just awesome.  Cons: -This game is pretty glitchy. Not mentioning the first port of this game on PC, which literally didn't work, this game has a lot of things that look a little off. It's always something small like a floating cell phone or someone running in circles. Every once in a while you'll car will launch its self a little ways or Wei will get thrown into the air by the terrain, but I neer encountered anything that took me out of the experience. - I wore a cop outfit this entire playthrough and, while hilarious, it's a little odd that you can do that. There were many laughs to be had when I was doing gang-activities in full police gear.Just a small thing, though. It's the outfit I chose to wear so you don't have to.   Sleeping Dogs is, for lack of a better word, fun, which is truly the most important thing any video game could ever be. It may just be a niche thing for me but it's everything I want in a video game. It's deep without taking itself too seriously. It's funny without resorting to gross-out humor or ♥♥♥♥ jokes. The pacing makes it fun and fair through the whole game. And most of all, the tutorials in this game aren't just boxes telling you what buttons to press. You learn through the game, which is a mark of a great game to me.   I love this game.

The open-world aspect gives the player the freedom to move around and initiate whatever missions the player wants. The mixed martial arts combat system offers fluid movement but it relies heavily on counters which can be redundant while playing long hours. The variety of combos and weapons allow the user to finish a task however he/she pleases. The graphics are great and the developers definitely make use of Hong Kong's vibrant community of street vendors and high rise buildings in order to make it feel like you are in the actual city. The story itself is decent and offers a lot of plot twists that might catch the player off guard. The driving system on the PC is comparable to driving with a controller on a console.   Speaking of consoles, the only major complaint I have for this game is that it was ported from consoles to PC. That being said, some of the controls have two actions binded to it as one key. This is really frustrating when you are sprinting towards a ledge and you accidentally vault over because the sprint and vault actions are binded to shift.   Overall, it is a great game that I would recommend buying if it is on sale.",

There is even a construction signboard from Singapore very own construction site. Hong Kong is a immerisve place to roam and being in Hong Kong myself many years ago, It is almost the same experience but in gaming. Sun Oh Yee or 18K are real gangs in but with a changed name (Sun Yee Oh and 22K in real) which depict well the situation and problems Hong Kong has in real life. The game has the best combat system compared to other open world games such as GTA or Saint Row. Many compared it to Batman Arkam series which I feel too are similar well design to deliver fun in button smashing. I gotta the original version and bought the definitive edition as well,I will advise not to unless you bought the original version without the whole dlc. The graphic only inprove on neon light reflection and the texture is the same as HD-resolution pack in original. If you have never played Sleeping Dogs,you should definitiely try this remaster. There is still many bugs in the games but doesnt affect completion of the game,the remaster really give Hong Kong the busyness Hong Kong has. The increase in human AI population is a good move. I would really like to see a sequel to it,since Wei Shen is expose as a cop now. The next game maybe Wei Shen plays as a high level police officer like Pendrew and hire another uncover cop to explore Sleeping Dog world again just maybe. Thx for reading the review. Cheers :)  Pro: Good combat system  Cultural expereience   Easy driving system  Graphical improvement looks good and graphically demanding even for PC  Con: Bugs still exist but doesnt affect progress of game  Phone reception tracking mission with confusing instruction   Things to improve: The bugs Flying in this game such as airplane Modding is able in this game",

            "review_text": "When you sit down to play sleeping dogs forget everything you have learned playing games like GTA and Saints Row. Sleeping dogs is a very unique open word action game that focouses heavily on hand to hand combat in the form of Martial Arts.   Gunplay is very minimal in sleeping dogs unlike in your typical open word action games. While it is there it is only introduced at around the middle of the game. While it is fun to have gunfights they do get a litttle stale towards the end of the game.  The martial Arts combat plays like the Batman Arkham games so when you see your enemy highlight red you can press E to counter it. Sometimes the animations can feel slow resulting in some fights that feel a little unfair especially the ones where it is a 8 on 1 fight.  The world is varied from the crowded streets oof North Point to the bustling streets of Central they all look great. But the night market is where the city comes alive. From Clothing shops to the man yelling 'You Want A Pork Bun?' make it feel alive and that is where the game first starts off.  The Story is an interesting idea but i never really felt gripped buy it. I never really felt like i was rising up the ranks of a triad gang and i feel like the Relationship with the boss Winston could have been explained more.   Im not going to go into detail with the story but you are Undercover Cop Wei Shen and you have been tasked with infiltrating the triads who Wei has a personal connection to. It is best you go into the story blind and form your own opinion on it.  The Difinitive edition comes with the 2 DLC's released for the game. Year Of The Snake and Nightmare In North Point.  Nightmare in north point is an ok DLC with an ok story its just ok.  I haven't played much of Year Of The Snake but it feels a bit weaker than Nightmare In North Point.  Overall sleeping dogs is a unique open owrld action game with solid Hand-To-Hand combat mechanics Slightly below average gunplay a slightly above average story and average DLC content.  There is alot to like here but i would recommend getting it on sale 7.5/10",

            "review_text": "This game is the yin-yang to any Grand Theft Auto game. Where as, in GTA, you mostly use your guns to fight and melee as a secondary. In this game, that's the complete opposite, but it's oh so fun.     Pros: -----  -Combat. The combat in this game is some of the most fun combat I've ever played with in a long time. Using Karate to punish all the gangs, who also use karate, and knocking someone out with a kick to the face. Couldn't be more satisfying. The gunplay however is nowhere near as fun, however it does play with a slow-mo mechanic which I kind of like.   -Choose your side. This game has a very interesting way to play. You can level up 2 different 'factions', and your level-ups for them are determined by how often you help one side or the other. It's kind of a play your own way thing, with no actual bearing on the main story, (to my knowledge) but it's pretty fun nontheless.   -Activities. There's an abundance of side activities to do throughout the game, and they're all either miscellaneous or faction-based. Needless to say I haven't done many myself, but the fact that there's so much to do beyond the main game is thrilling.   -Parkour. This one is a little more of a personal opinion, but I absolutely love the parkour in this game. Especially when you're chasing down a bad guy like a thief, or climbing over obstacles/climbing buildings to get a vantage point. This mechanic alone is what makes this game great for fighting and racing.    -Environment. Not that the setting of Hong Kong isn't a beautiful site to behold, but this isn't the point of this Pro. The environment always helps you in this game. Whenever you're in combat, you've obviously got your karate to keep you occupied, but what if that gets too boring? Well, grab them, and smash them into an air duct, or a vending machine, or just slam down a shop barrier on top of them. You can use dozens of these environmental hazards to K.O an enemy in an instant, and is oh so statisfying when you do it.      Cons: -----   -Camera. Now this one is a big one for me, whether im running and i want to turn around, or im driving, and trying to back up someplace. The camera is constantly against you in this game, and is absolutely horrendous with regards to turning someplace. I've fiddled with a lot of the controls/sensitivity, but it doesn't seem to help. Giving the player good control of their camera is necessary for these kinds of games.   -Gunplay. I referenced this earlier in one of my Pros, but as much as I love the combat in this game, the gunplay is the one part that makes me feel iffy on all of it. First off, the gunplay isn't even that great, it's boiled down to a mediocre gunfight which anyone can win as long as you have cover to slow-mo out of. The controls for the guns are wonky as all hell, considering the crosshair and the precision you need for even the most basic guns is ludicrous. And the variety you get in actual guns is just lame. To my knowledge, the only 2 classes of guns you can get in the game are pistols and SMG's. Nothing more.    -UI. Now this one is a bit iffy for me as well, the UI in this game is OK at best. The mini-map for example seems a bit too small, the icons for getting to places, as well as collectibles aren't as big as they probably should be, the phone menus look like TRACFONE garbage, and there aren't really enough options that allow us to resize this part. As much as I love the rest of this game, the UI isn't a very strong point.    -Lack of Fast Travel. This game is huge, I mean, really huge. Perhaps if I could compare, I'd say *slightly* smaller than GTA IV. That being said, there's no method to fast travel in this game. If you have to go 3,000m to your next objective, go get a car, and drive there. No waiting time for you. I find this only particularly frustrating when I'm completing a quest, and my next quest or activity is 1,000m+ away.     Outside of all this though, I can safely recommend this game. It has a lot of stupid things wrong with it, but also a load of amazing things going for it. If you want a game with primarily melee combat, driving, racing, side activities, playing as gang/cop, and exploring, then this game is absolutely for you. Have fun in Hong Kong.   7/10.",

WAY better than GTA but as soon as i reached the mission Club Bam Bam in the Main Story Mode and beat the group of thugs in the bar to get to Benny [the Clubs owner] it goes to the cut scene were you bang on the door and yell for him to come out of his office. When the cut scene ends the game Freezes for a about 2 seconds then full screen cancels and then it shuts off the game and exits steam completely, i tried several times to do the mission but it kept exiting over and over. At first i thought it must have been a download error so i deleted the game and redownloaded but i just tried playing the mission again after the download finished and it still does the same problem and cancels out the game and steam. Please fix this problem in the next update soon so i can continue playing this great game.",

Sure, but it's only the style of the game. You could say Skyrim and GTA V are alike just because it's open world with a main story and lots of side games, but you wouldn't. So, that being said, I don't want to compare this to GTA V. It's such a great game on it's own and should be more known.",

It's not as open world as it would like you to think as it’s pretty much scripted and can sometimes feel very restricted in your choices, but it’s still a solid game. The fighting is very satisfying if you can connect your combo’s, I haven’t been able to set up or configure my game pad for this game and I am having to use my keyboard and mouse, which I feel somewhat hampers my full enjoyment of the game. It’s not like the Batman games, but the gameplay is on par. I would give this game a solid 8.5 out of 10 as it’s so much fun to play. ",

The driving isn the best but its far from the worse. This game does collectables right. Insead of how most games just toss ♥♥♥ loads of them to make you waste time and give the illusion of a long game. The collectables in this game benefit you with rewards such as more health or new fight moves. and theres not an abserd amount.  No guide required either just go out on a date with one of the girls they each give you locations of the items. Despite not touching firearms till later in the game you stil rely heavily on hand to hand combat once you get them. The only real cons in this game is meh driving, The GFs are literally just one mission and go nowhere so in a way feels extremely unfinished and once completing the campaign there isn much to do. Still a Solid game that are even better then most third person games today.",

PROS:  - great story - good fight system - lots of secondary mission - lots of hours of gameplay  CONS:  - bugs and graphical glitches - physics is too arcade and unreal (at least more arcade then GTA IV) - sometime the lack of guns is a bit tedious - in some missions the freedom of action is too restricted",

            "review_text": "A great open world, a ton of quickly accessible and varying mini-games and side missions, and a combat system that is half in a similar style to the Batman Arkham series and half GTA's gunplay make for a wonderful experience, but be prepared to reconfigure the controls (defaults suck).   Highly recommend despite the porting/control issues (see below), but I do suggest you spend some time to rebind the controls and make them usable!  PROS: -World is a good size with events consistently near each other (not too much pointless running) -A good number of side missions and mini-games that use different mechanics (fighting, racing, number puzzles, gun fights, etc). -Good variety of *meaningful* collectibles. Collectibles unlock additional melee combos, health bonuses, etc.  -Cash sinks throughout the city (buy furniture for your various apartments from various vendors); clothes are also presented as a cash sink but due to the 'preset outfits' (DLC?) they become meaningless within the first hour or two of playing. -Radio and music selection (multiple stations, good banter, many types of music) -Excellent 'Social Hub' incorporating 'multiplayer' (arcade style) scores to actions within the game, such as Longest Jump, Fastest track times on races, and a flurry of other stats you can compete for. Integration of this is well done while ingame, but seeing what boards there are could be a little better done (overall its great and I really wish more games do this! It should be standard in the industry) -Excellent Cop/Triad score mechanic in missions promote the player to win without destroying everything but doesn't punish you much if you do. Outside of the missions, unless a cop sees you do something wrong, you do not get penalized for hurting civilians (this is a minor, but important point; to compare, Watch Dogs also has a reputation system but in that game hurting civilians outside of missions hurts your reputation which basically forces the player to be extra careful to the point of annoyance....Sleeping Dogs has the same 'good guy encouragement' but none of the annoyance.)  NEUTRALS: -Clothes are cool, but since certain sets give massive values compared to the rest, you will basically wear the +50% damage dealt or -50% damage taken outfit in almost every scenario. -'Food' shops around town make the town feel much more alive and provide a mini-cash sink....but the long unskippable animations will make you skip them unless you are on a really difficult area and absolutely need the buff.  -Very minimal immersion issue: Your character is a 'deep undercover' cop, but half the missions are 'police' missions which involve you knocking out criminals, etc. In the police shooting missions at least you wear the swat mask, but in the other missions you just run around punching people.... but everywhere else in the game everyone in town instantly recognizes you... -'Preset outfits' are way too strong compared to the in-game clothes. I assume these were released at DLC at some point, but it greatly modifies the balance of the game. (For example, one of the early outfits gives +5% melee damage....or you can buy the 'preset' outfit that gives +50% melee AND +50% grapple damage....compared to 5%, yea...) -Gunplay is weak. Bringing up 'aim' mode gives a huge reticle, you can't carry more than 1 weapon at a time, and, in general, if you have a gun you can wipe out armies of enemies until you run out of bullets. The entire 'gunplay' experience feels very forced in this game; given the gangster environment of the game, I can understand the need to include guns but they are certainly the weakest aspect of Sleeping Dogs.   CONS: -CONTROLS!! The control scheme for this game is clearly designed for a controller. There isn't much that could have been done to remedy the problem when bringing it to PC because the problems are deeply embedded in the game design itself, however the MOUSE5 button issue could have been prevented and that 1 extra button would have gone a long way in remedying the other issues.  ---'Aim mode' while driving seems to share a key with 'enter/exit vehicle' by default for some reason. When I encountered the part in the game where you are meant to shoot while driving, my character kept jumping out of the vehicle.....HINT: In the controls setup, under 'Vehicle controls' (push CTRL), there is a separate entry for 'aim mode'; you can use this entry to bind a different key so you can actually use aim mode while driving without diving out of your vehicle.  ---Camera view keeps repositioning on its own if you move....It is possible to look around, but its far more difficult and annoying than it needs to be. ---The game thinks MOUSE4 and MOUSE5 are the same key. Thus, you cannot bind anything to your mouse5 key. ---The 'sprint' and 'parkour' button is the same key (most PC players use shift to sprint, but space for jump mechanics). This also means you often have to stop sprinting when running in a tight area because if you are sprinting and get too close to a wall, he might parkour over it unintentionally. ---There is a 'lock on' button, but it is not a toggle (and no option that I know of to make it a toggle). On a controller this may be fine, but holding LCTRL or similar while moving with WASD is silly. Luckily, the lock-on feature is useless in melee combat (I never used it).  ---Similar to 'lock on', when you are holding a gun this becomes 'aim mode' instead. Again, a toggle would go a LONG way. This is playable, but annoying at best; however since the game's gunplay is extremely easy and shallow, you won't spend much time with this. ---'Aim-assist' ....sigh. Thankfully there isn't much shooting in this game and it can be mostly disabled.  -Minor BUGS! Audio lines will get cross/double played quite often. Rare occasion game crashes for no apparent reason  -'Camera' missions (final step): you need to watch the criminals through a camera and identify the one to be arrested. The problem is, there are no clear mechanics how to do this. Sometimes you can see a handoff so you know who the supplier is, but other times its the guy who has a briefcase or the guy who shoots someone....or sometimes nobody does anything and you just wait 50 seconds and the game tells you which one it is....??   -Fast travel system: you can only fast travel via taxi that are randomly driving around the city (a GREAT idea on its own) but there is NO other way to fast travel and you can only fast travel to certain missions or stores. You can NOT fast travel to your own apartment (yea you read that right).....not even if you are already in a car yourself (I guess he can't drive himself? lol). You have to drive around until you find a cab, pull over, and then pay the cab for a ride to your apartment....thats just silly. -Voice acting often doesn't match the character and is almost all in English with awkward accents (some accents are clearly American though the character has never been to America, other accents are borderline racist)....this is made weirder by the fact that you can get the SUBTITLES in Mandarin (??) but you can't get the spoken audio in Mandarin with English subtitles !! Why!?!? Mandarin spoken audio would have gone a long way.",
