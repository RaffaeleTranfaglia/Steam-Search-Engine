            "review_text": "Its a beautiful game. Really feels like the game of kings, unlike other comic-like chess games on steam. Feels like the devs take it serious. It's made of beautiful graphics and environments. Even tough it could have more rooms to choose from, they really know how to make a beautiful setting to play chess.",

            "review_text": "Simple chess program with both local AI play and online play. Also chess tutoring and chess problems exist to challenge you.   Lots of different chess set styles to choose from, and each style has a sub style of wood, metal, etc. you can change your view using the mouse, but it doesnt appear to be a truly free camera movement. All in all, I think its worth the 10 bucks if you like chess and want a nice little program to play it.",
