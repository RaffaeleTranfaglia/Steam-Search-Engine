Needs new level balancing for example, lvl 5 is harder then lvl 8 (not sure if these were the right lvl numbers)  tis game is good if you like to think about a good puzzle/ strategy 7/10 keep the work up! :D &gt;",

It's to me an original gameplay, i hadn't played as a monster figuring out how to get around a cave and eat/crush or even scare little people, till now. This being the Devs first game, i am thoroughly impressed, it all fits so well together imo and i think he has done very well :)",
