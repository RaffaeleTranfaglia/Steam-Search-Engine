            "review_text": ":Updated now that my account has been transfered and I've played it again: This game is a VERY FUN party turnbased RPG. Especially for it being free. Dont let the tutorial fool you. You dont just right click enemies 5 times per turn. Those are level 1 characters with 1 ability and no mana/mana regen.  Gauntlet mode is insanely fun. 4 player Co-op survival against waves of enemies.   I played this game SOOOOO much on kongregate back when I was like 16. This is a REALLY REALLY good turn based strategy game. Its kind of simple at first, but the levels later on will have you trying multiple times to beat them because they can get hard. And not artificial difficulty. I mean you actually have out play the enemy. Despite alot of the classes being unlocked, you CAN earn the ingame currency to unlock them through challenges in missions and achievements. Or you can be like me and sell items from other games to not actually pay money out of pocket to unlock stuff anyways. On my Kongregate account I'd already bought 2 extra character slots and had about 250 Radiance left over. I dont think there were achievements before, and it reset the campaign progress for me, so I can just earn that Radiance over again and keep my old stuff B)  The story seems to have been updated and the UI may have seen some work, but the UI is still a little bit weak and all of the menus are a bit much to take in all at once, but it's still being updated after all these years so that's a major plus. Enemies I'd never seen before have been added to geh game, as well as some new story stuff I dont remember probably got added, though that's just because its been so long since I'd played this. There is a handfull of bugs and performance issues that I dont remember having when I played it in my browser, but this could just be the steam release having problems. The devs have patched a few things and I assume the other issues I've seen will get patched, but they dont cause the game to not work for me or anything. Just some FPS drops.  I always really like games where you can build your character in different ways. I have a Valkyrie that is built for tanking even though it's 'supposed' to be a dps class. I have a Priestess that can burst/buff rather than being a boring healbot. And I apparnetly bought a Paladin for something before I stopped playing before. But he was level one and I dont really know what I wanted to do with him. But I always enjoy games where you arent restricted to make your character 'heal bot' 'tank machine' and 'killy mc die in one hit' because thats what they're 'supposed' to be. Freedom to build your character however you want is a major plus from me.  I'm currently not constantly playing this because I'm waiting for my account to be transfered to my steam account. That and Warhammer + KF2 just updated and all my friends are sucking me into that. But believe me, I probably have ~100 hours in the game from like 2011. This is a fun game if you like any of the tags: Turn based / RPG / Party based / Strategy, you'll enjoy this game if you play past the tutorial.",

            "review_text": "Great fun for all fans of tactical RPGs. All microtransactions can be done in reasonable time with in-game currency. (killing about 1500 monsters is a new character, you can kill several characters in one turn especially with the Assassin type heroes of which two are available for free and there is a total of 8 characters to be bought).   Of course you can just solo through the game if that's what you prefer. The leveling system makes that possible. Whenever you level up, you choose which party members gain experience. So you can supercharge one character or distribute it on one group. Keep in mind that level difference is not as severe as in most games so 5 level 2 characters could beat 1 level 10 character.",

The gauntlets at high level, while hard to find a group to do them with, are incredibly challenging and need a great deal of strategy to defeat. Story mode is great for a quick farm, or leveling (currently on insane difficulty, extremely hard to progress.) The Community is great as well, don't let the few so-so people that don't like anyone throw you off. Being able to hang out with the dev after each patch is amazing as well, being able to see what the plans are for the future, and getting those hard to answer questions answered. 100/10, Will continue playing. Cmon guys, it's free to play. Might as well give it a try!",

This game has very beautiful art, the people and settings look so good. That is, when you're not actually playing the game. The cutscenes are gorgeous, whereas the game itself is a bit of a let down in the graphics department. It makes the game look much older than it needs to be.   Storywise, it seems very intriguing, as you play as an 'Immortal' a being that cannot die. In this game, you are not the caster of such creatures, instead you are the creature, which put an interesting spin on an old fashioned gametype. Other than that, the game is turned based, and multiplayer so its good.   BUT THE BEST PART IS... ITS FREE! Well, at least most of it is... There are certain creatures that are only obtainable from irl money, but most of them can be purchased with this weird sun currency thing (which is earned in game).",

            "review_text": "I've played a few hours of this and I'm just going to list off issues I had with the game and stuff I found interesting, to be generous. I'm a big fan, of RPGs and I don't mind slow-paced games, so with the inevitable countless downvotes of *a* negative review, I'd like some feedback at the very least. I'd also like to point out that I don't necessarily hate the game, especially since it seems like it's a fully functional game but is still being tweaked and updated.  First off, the combat/gameplay, the most important part. It's a basic RPG with action points required for movement, basic attacks, and skills/spells. Simple, so there's not a lot to explain but of course it's a bit too simple as from what I saw and experienced out of the basic free characters, a lot of the stuff is either useless in most cases (such as buffs, and I will explain why in a bit) or situational but will never be drastically required ( demobilitization, for example, and I'll explain that in a bit too ). A lot of the skills/spells are simply a hindrance at lower levels (you have to level up skills and there's naturally a level requirement for each 'stage' of a skill) and simply isn't worth it unless it is, well, worth it. The Valkyrie's dagger ability, for example, is pathetically weak and honestly not worth getting EVER. Now, the gameplay works using time units aka action points, which means stuff like demobilitization(stun, slow, etc.) naturally will remove action points upon the afflicted's turn, and not simply stop them from playing that turn. Why is this an issue, as I am trying to imply? Well, let's talk about how enemies act in this game. First off, groups. Always a group. This means if you pull a single enemy(let's assume you only see this one enemy), the whole group will follow. That's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, especially if you can't SEE the rest of the enemies and considering the restriction of action points, you'll either end your turn in a situation where you'll get attack first or you'll try to run away and, chances are, you'll get attack first because - Oh, wait, I didn't mention this, did I? Enemies have drastically more AP than you, for example the spiders you encounter in the desert, area #2. Beautiful. If you're following my line of thinking, this means they attack more than you. Now, here's the obscure part that is overlooked in RPGs and the AI that controls the enemies - They will go for a SINGLE enemy and gang up on that single enemy until you either pull their attention (assuming there is such a skill or spell, I'm not entirely sure) or you kill them which is, well, unlikely since even the spiders are pretty beefy in this game. So, imagine this. You pull a group. A bunch of spiders rush to your party and... The first person attacked loses approx 50-75% of their health on the first turn. How do you feel? Well, not happy of course. It's something that ruined Neverwinter nights for me, as well as Baldur's Gate where the enemies would goose-chase your party members regardless of who it is. It's the lack of taunt-like skills but it's mixed in with a disgustingly high DPS caused by 5-ish enemies attacking a single party member, and that really stacks up. Now for the left overs. You lose gold everytime a party member dies, albeit the gold is, AFAIK, only used for buying equipment in the shop. They also never die permanently but they respawn after a few turns (it varies, it seems, as I've had 1 turn AND 2 turns for the same person on the same map, indefinitely) but they respawn at 'spires' aka beginning of the map/spawn area, which will almost always be a far distance away unless you are getting destroyed on your first fight on a map, which is very plausible. Now, something I REALLY want to talk about is the bosses. The bosses are *absolute grindfests*. It's like making a mining simulator and it takes like 30 minutes to mine one rock. A boss that is specific to mention is the Wyrm(or whatever it is, but it's model is the 3-headed snake, previously seen to be used for a Wyrm enemy) which not only has a good 1500-ish HP on normal, but also has life-steal (was healing about 200 per turn for me). There's other bosses like this, like a manticore that you have to fight that is in the area after Beefy the SnakeEater aka BeefWyrm, that has about double the HP and somehow feels like it is the *exact same thing* except he's able to buff himself to take less damage and attack faster. REALLY has to be nerfed or at the very least, changed. That being said, HP, AP, and DMG definitely has to be adjusted to not feel like dark souls level of difficulty, especially on normal, which is the lowest difficulty. Also, the game is REALLY grindy.  How levelling works in this game is that your 'summoner' or 'main immortal' levels up and you distribute skill points among skill between your immortals, 1 per level, meaning your immortals don't get individual points.  The story is, sadly, pretty interesting. Basically, you start off in the game as a an 'immortal', one that has been tied to someone else's being, perhaps soul. If they die, you lose your immortality. Interesting idea. Sadly, the dialogue feature(talking to people, making choices that give you misc. bonuses and apparently there is some romance in the game, of both genders too!) happens only when you beat a mission, so it's infrequent considering how long it takes to beat each map, generally speaking, about 20 minutes, depending on your pacing.   So, I mentioned that there are free characters earlier. The 5 free characters are the Dryad, the Valkyrie, the Paladin, the Priestess, and the Druid. Pretty self-explanatory classes except the Valkyrie is agility-based as well as the Dryad(it's like a centuar-thing) and the Druid is strength-based, so that's a bit odd. The non-free characters are the Ivory Sentinel, the Beserker, the Pheonix Mage, the Summoner, the Tigress(like a Khajiit ranger, basically), the Inquisitor, the Treant, and the Banewitch. Now, don't fret. The currency used for the in-game store('Radiance') is acquirable by completely achievements and challenges, as well as daily quests, so you can earn the Radiance as a F2P model but it takes a while. In a few days of playing, I only got about 250-ish.  The music is nothing special. It's mostly atmospheric / 'just there' so I'm not going to touch on it that much. The least I'll say is that it's better than nothing but I never noticed anything specifically intriguing.  The graphics are... Well, I'm not sure what they're called but they aren't eye-hurting. Great amount of detail put into the models and maps.  So, one thing I also wanted to point out is that there IS co-op/multiplayer for every level that I had played up until. That being said, I wanted to play alone and loot(and presumably XP) obtained by other players isn't shared with you, or it doesn't show up and so isn't something that will be noticed. The game seems like it's best played with others, so that you can overwhelm the enemies on a map but then... Why have a singleplayer at all if the odds are stacked in the first place?  That's pretty much the majority of what I have to say. Is the game bad? No. It's just not very polished at the time of this me writing this review. I put in a fair amount of time to get past the first area of the game and get into the 'real challenge' part of the game, albeit the obligatory tutorial area of the game (I'd say the first 4 levels being increasingly worse) did get annoying easily. I won't suggest this game because there are many flaws that apply to anyone who isn't a raging 'game expert' that coincidentally knows EXACTLY how to play this game. Not worth the trouble for me, especially since I get VERY angry at games that have ridiculous situations as well as punishments ontop of it to add insult to injury. No one wants to waste their time playing against ridiculous odds only to die over and over. It gets tedious and monotonous.",

It's not very often that you see an Indie, F2P game that has that kind of production value.   There are tons of Immortals to unlock. Don't worry, if you don't want to spend money you can always play until you have enough radiance (the game's currency) to unlock whichever immortal is the most interesting to you.

            "review_text": "Interesting old-school tactical game that allows multiple players in the same instance fighting either against each other or against the same enemy.  It's your typical Turn-Based controls, but with the twists of the fantasy RPG inventory and classes.  While many things are locked behind the option of a 1-time payment or many hours of gameplay, it should only matter those who really are keen on that part as you can still access half of the characters for free.  The game does lack in terms of informations about the systems of the game such as leveling is based on your 'profile' and not the characters so, initially, you level your main character and as you unlock more character slot in your party, you notice you can only level 1 character for each of level... so you gotta redo the same quests again and again to level multiple characters which can easily become a pain in the butt for many. (You can reach the max level of 250 and each character has up to 80 skills points, meaning you can max 3 character at most or sacrifice some characters' skills' level.)  While I recommend this game, a warning about the multiplayer side of the game. To be honest, currently, the game barely have enough players as it is... Especially new players. You might find 1-4 new players and that's it. The remaining are high level players. Will they help/play with you? Maybe... but that remove lot of the fun factor.  Still, it's a fun game so Yup, recommended.  P.S. The game is build in Flash so yeah... it's a Flash game which might come with issues if you play it with something like an Integrated Video Card on a laptop. You might have to painfully access some option to make the game appears correctly.",
