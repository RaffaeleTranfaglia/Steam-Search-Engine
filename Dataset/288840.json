            "review_text": "I like the occasional hidden object game as a break from endless zombie slaying and the conquering of endless realms. This game indeed scratches that itch. Very casual; extremely linear and the hidden object areas are good but not too difficult or clever. Where this game fails is in the so called puzzles. They are extremely simple and the developers failed so far offering no mini-games with these. Where the game gets it right is presentation. Good atmosphere, the graphics &amp; sound/music are good for it's genre. I believe that casual players and gamers like myself who are looking for a change of pace will enjoy this game. However aficionados of this type of game will probably find it lacking. Only once did I even consider using the hint button to find a hidden object and a few times I found myself wishing the hidden object portions where either longer or more difficult; this on the so called advanced setting.",

            "review_text": "It was an OK game. It was VERY short, though (only 2.5 hours for me to finish it). The story line has potential, but they didn't really flesh out the details much, which could done a lot for the game and made it a little longer.   Spoiler: at the very least, they could have told us how the first wife died and why she's evil. Is she just ticked off being brought back form the dead, or is she jealous that he got remarried AND they had a kid? And, why the hell would her servants, loyal though they may have been, want to bring her back? Was he an evil guy? Doesn't seem so from his notes. And, where did they learn to use black magic from? Blah, blah blah. Lots of holes... Any way, if you get this super cheap like I did, it's a good distraction for a few hours, but I can't recommend paying full price for it...",

            "review_text": "I only reccomend getting this game in a bundle or on sale, do not pay full price for it!  Let's get the worst part out of the way first, why you should not pay full price for it. You can see by my hours played that this is not a very long game. It's by no means a bad one but it is short so if you want short entertainment, a few dollars dropped on this in a bundle with other games is worth it. Otherwise, do not pay full asking price because it is not worth it.  That being said, it is a very fun hidden object game. In terms of hidden object scenes (HOGs) there are a handful of them but not so many that they become annoying. This game is very inventory item heavy in that a lot of game play is finding an item to use later on. One good feature is that areas will have an Area Cleared banner on the top of the screen after everything is done in the area so you don't have to worry about not knowing if you missed something or not. There arn't a ton of puzzles compared to other HOG games but there are some fun little puzzles occasionally.  A main mechanic in this game is traveling back in time through reflective surfaces to obtain items in the past, hide them and get them in the future. Sometimes this doesn't make sense logically (you hide some in a baby's crib so sometime between the past and the future no one thought to check it?) but since when were HOG games a place for logic? This is a neat little feature but I feel they could have done some more with the time traveling part other than just hiding items like maybe areas only reachable in the past due to things breaking.  Storywise it's a bit typical, dead mother, haunted house... You get more story from reading the diary and papers you find laying around otherwise the story can pretty much be ignored. The voice acting isn't too bad and I found it slightly better quality than most other HOG games.  Graphically this game isn't HD quality but it's not Minecraft pixelated level graphics either. I'd say 7/10 around since it's not so bad that it hurt the hidden object scences but not high enough quality to make that a selling point.  I noticed maybe two annoying things, one, the hidden objects often have a small clickable area so you need to be precise in your clicks. The other is if you spam using an item (I KNOW THIS ITEM WORKS HERE STOP TELLING ME OTHERWISE GAME) it will keep playing the 'this isn't going to work' message lines as many times as you clicked. Which can be annoying when you finally give in to the games logic and want to click the area to see what hint it gives you.  One really nice feature is that custom difficulty options it gives you. You have about three options for the most part on how long the hint button recharges as well as how long until you can skip a puzzle and if active areas glow. It's nice if you want certain things to be easier and others to be harder like if you like not using hints but hate puzzles and want those to be skippable faster. That is a nice feature.  Overall its a good fun game that will entertain you for one night and then you'll hide it in your Steam library and forget all about it.",
