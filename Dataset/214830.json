Balance speed vs. grinding vs. money management to solve each stage, contains 99% of the content of all other versions of the game... probably the 'ultimate' variant. A crazy game which has some silly moments and a barrage of replay value given the multiple awards, unlocks, and branches each stage might come complete with.  A speedy game deserves an equally-quick review, no?",
