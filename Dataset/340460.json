I played for 5 minutes, I guess and my question is: Why is there a mobile app on Steam?  I hated it because I can't use the keyboard to play. You must use right click to walk and you can only walk. Oh, and you can't fight the enemies from their backs. Upgradation part I think it is okay. It's a shame because I like RPG old school but that is horrible.  ---------  Estaba aburrida y vi esta ♥♥♥♥♥♥ en la lista de nuevos lanzamientos populares. Creo que jugué por 5 minutos, y ahora me pregunto: ¿Por qué hay una aplicación de celular en Steam?  Odié que sólo fuera click derecho y no pudiera usar el teclado. Sólo podés caminar y encima no podés pegarles por la espalda. La parte de mejoras creo que está bien. Es una lástima porque me gustan los RPG al viejo estilo pero este está del carajo.",

They just put together stuff from the movie 300, and from other tug of war games and cram it all into this mess of a game.  Not only does this game offer microtransaction but it doesn't even work, the options menu are simplistic and they can't even get the font size of the title right with any kind of resolution.  This is clearly the most stupidest Mobile to PC port over i have ever seen. In the grand scheme of things instead of optimizing the game for PC usage they just re-arrange a few things and slapped 'PC' on the game and that was it. Lol! for the love of god, you have to use a touchscreen monitor in order to play this game no coding for the standard W,A,S,D controls or directional controls. Only mouse and touchscreen.   I won't go into this any further. Check out the screenshots from the community and check the reviews. In fact don't check just don't play this game!  ",
