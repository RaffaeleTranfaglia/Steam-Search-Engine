            "review_text": "SO.. Where do I start? I had to make a transaction to sell some uneeded stuff over the steam marketplace so I literally looked for the cheapest game that I thought I may could put up with one day and found Overcast - Walden and the werewolf for $0.14..   Overcast - Walden and the werewolf is a physiological horror game that eats at you with the erie atmosphere not knowing when, where, or what may pop out. In between every chapter you get cinematic cutscenes that fill in the story piece by piece. The cutscenes have heroic music behind them and subtitles telling the story. You have 9 chapters of story to complete which can be completely within a couple of hours at most.  This is a FPS. In the left hand you have a lantern, the right you have your handy rifle. You only get one gun. One bullet and then you have to reload everytime. Only a couple of keys to control the whole game while having the 'hand' cursor the same as Penumbra or Amnesia games to grab and move objects around.   While being a huge horror movie and game fan I adore this game for what it tries to do. The graphics are dated and are not pretty as the games today but Overcast proves you can still scare the sh*t out of people without modern graphics. Now for graphics this games graphics are pretty plain. Very grainy style graphics that makes it hard to see anywhere far from you. BUT. I've seen people get scared and jump at a lot less than this. But there are a couple of times in the game that I can imagine some people may get freaked out or even jump at.  Gameplay was pretty smooth for me but I did encounter a bug two times during the final boss fight that I guess kept the fight going and somehow I randomly died both times? After one final attempt before shutting the game off for the night, randomly with me expecting more fight the game ended!  The combat in the game was very boring in my opinion. It gives you a gun that has one shot, takes forever to reload and makes you back up - shoot - reload during every fight. I can understand that this machinism is designed to implant fear or panic but in my case it just annoyed me to no end making things feel very drawn out.  I was not a big fan of the story, but to me it was more of a game with a 'base' story that thrown me in the game to play. The heroic music in each cinematic cutscene made me feel like a badass and even in some combat the music gave me hope!  Bottom line: For under a dollar if you are a horror fan looking for something to occupy your time for a couple hours, maybe give you a couple jump scares than pick this up. I do recommend this game because besides the final fight I had no problems running or playing this game. It has a story, it was in 3d, and could get a couple good jumps out of some people. That is my $0.14 cents worth people :)",

Well, the stage were you have to run from the werewolf has actually improved, but everything else is just bad. Instead of a horror game I received a horrible first person shooter were you have to reload after every single shot. And the worst part is that most of the stages after the ones that were in the alpha consist of shooting. There was a 'run through corridors and kill some spioders'-stage or a 'run in circles around a room and kill some spiders'-stage and a 'run through a graveyard and kill spiders and skeletons'-stage and of course 'defeat enemy hordes and die a couple of times'-stage.  And despite the fact that the story is nearly non-existant the final stage seems to claim otherwise and actually throws a deus ex machina cliffhanger at you. Sorry, but I'm not interested in how the story pans out! Especially not because the developers delete negative feedback on the forums.",

This game feels like a student project more than anything else. The gameplay is clunky, the 'horror' is entirely composed of sudden loud noises and bright flashes. The camera regularly shakes, sways, and the game intentionally skips frames to make it seem like the player is hallucinating. All this does is make horrible gameplay even worse.

The creatures killed all the people from his village, so therefore, Walden wants revange.  It looks like the game is an one-man-production, so it's not comperable with 'real' shooter games or big names in the shooter game business. The game is a mini game. If you're good in shooter gaming, you will finish the game in about 1 hour, if you're really bad in shooting, you will about 2h to finish the whole story. The game has only 9 chapters to play, some of them you will play through in 2-4 minutes, because it's too easy on some points. Some levels are hard, but not really hard, to play through.   I will recommend this game because the game isn't made that bad and small game creators should be supported. Anyway, the normal price of the game is about 1$, on sale you can get the game for some cents, and the game is some cents worth.

Bad artworks and animations but they manage to keep it hidden under the darkness and the overlay effect, which give strong creepy mood. Nevertheless, the lousy animations kind of break the immersion.  It's cheap, and somehow quite optimized for an indie game. Runs great on my old laptop, which is quite unexpected for this kind of games. I played better looking indie games, but with way much horrible optimizations.  Physics are ok. Overall reminds me of the Penumbra series, altho lacked the polish like Penumbra let alone Amnesia.  The devs do tried their best on this game. But they're missing some stuffs, like the t-posed guy, which is sadly breaks the immersion quite heavily.  Do I recommend it? Yeah, if you got a spare dollar.",

The name of the game could easily be 'Jumpscares-the game'. There is one around every corner, usually very predictable and not at all scary. One of the bosses of the game is giant snake, that looks like a sock and the skeletons looks like they are made of papier mache. And of course, when all other methods of scaring people fail, they bring out the giant spiders. The following paragraph contains spoilers of the 'story', the term 'story' being used loosley. There is very little connection between the chapters of the game. Walden just randomly ends up on a boat, then in the 'Dungeon of Pain' (let that name sink in), then in some cemetery.  The gameplay is despicable. The Hunter has a shotgun in his right hand and a lantern in the left. The said shotgun can be loaded with only one bullet at a time, meaning you have you reload after every. single. ♥♥♥♥ing. shot. The reloading process takes about 4 seconds. However, when he realods, he also puts the lantern down, and when hes done, he brings up the shotgun. But this doesn't mean, that you can already take your second shout, that would make too much sense. First, you have to wait a second or two while be brings up the damn latern too. So that means that you have to wait about 5-6 seconds between shots. Now, if I'll count how many times I've died, because he didn't bring his lamp up yet... Or beacuse the enemies spawned on me... Do yourself a favor, don't buy this.",
