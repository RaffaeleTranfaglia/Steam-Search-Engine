            "review_text": "Been a hardcore adventure gamer since the days of text-based glory in the 80s. Never thought I'd care about these hidden object games, to be honest the vast majority of them are tragically primitive. These Artifex Mundi games are not, they're in a class of their own.  There's a lot of classic adventure elements in them, you find items, figure out how to combine said items to achieve the result you're after and thusly advance the storyline. Every now and then you're confronted with a hidden object scene, a fact that makes my eyes water and kills my inner child bit by bit. In a stroke of pure brilliance they've added an option to play an alternative game and that way bypass the hidden object scene entirely. What you're left with is an adventure game and occasional boardgame challenges, fantastic.   Rather uniquely they also tend to feature strong female protagonists that aren't constantly trying to assert the fact that they're female and strong, they just are. This is something that you'd be hard pressed to find in any other genre.  Finally, it works flawlessly in linux. As have all Artifex Mundi games I've tried so far.",

            "review_text": "I've played maybe 20-30 hidden object games to date (probably more), and I'd have to say Abyss is indeed one of the better ones out there, but has some flaws that really stuck with me as I played.  First of all, the game is beautiful. Although the detailed artwork is clearly inspired by the Bioshock series (and a lot of story elements), it looks great with a colorful palette and some imaginative locations. There are a lot of areas to explore, as well. The music is very nice and does a good job of setting the mood, but can get a bit repetitive after awhile.   For the game play, this is your standard IHOG/HOPA, basically adventure game lite with Hidden Object Scenes sprinkled in. As an adventure gamer myself, I always play on Expert to give me a bit of challenge and lengthen my game experience, but I found the game to be on the easy side overall. Not a horrible thing if you're looking for a relaxing evening, but I prefer my IHOGs to last longer than 4 hours on the hardest difficulty. Even the puzzles were fairly easy taking me only a few minutes to figure most out, and many needing only a few moves to complete. The most challenging part for me was going back and finding older Hidden Object Scenes that have reactivated; they don't sparkle in Expert, so it's basically a game of 'let's click on everything' in the hopes the scene is indeed active again. I know this is pretty standard for Expert mode in most HOGs, but honestly, it's just an exercise in frustration, not added challenge. If the devs are reading this, putting in an option for sparkles on reactivated HOS's would be a much welcome addition in future games.  The Hidden Object Scenes themselves are well done, nicely drawn items without too much clutter, and have a nice range of difficulty, but none of the items were what I would consider unfairly hidden. And although I really enjoy HOS's, I know not everyone is a fan, so the option to play Dominos instead is a nice touch. The Dominos mini-game itself is fun, relaxing and mildly stimulating,   While the story took a lot of elements from Bioshock, it didn't resonate with me as much as some of Artifex Mundi's other games. I know HOG's aren't exactly a great source of deep, thought-provoking storytelling, but I felt like Abyss was flirting with some really interesting concepts, but those ideas kept getting derailed and neutered.  I think my biggest issue came down to the voice acting, though. Maybe I'm being a little more critical than I should be having come off of a couple of games that had absolutely amazing voice actors, but here...it's just awful. I wanted so badly to turn off the voices as every time any of the characters uttered something I couldn't help but cringe. If there is anything I would like to see in future HOGs it would be a toggle for the voices. Sometimes just reading and letting my mind fill in the blanks is better than being stuck with voices that are pulling me out of the experience.  That said, I did enjoy the game quite a bit and can see myself playing it again in the future. I certainly look forward to some of Artifex Mundi's other games making their way to Steam.",

The voice acting is passable at best, and the animation (or, what of it there is) is downright atrocious.  Despite this, the game is surprisingly charming. The finer points of the story really do draw you in, and you somehow care about the characters. The puzzles are fun, engaging, and at times quite difficult. Although the soundtrack isn't extensive, it's actually quite nice and helps the game to be immersive. The art is really quite lovely, and the point and the hidden objects are cleverly disguised. It's a great way to relax and unwind.",

Despite not being a great game, everything sounds at least decent, including good graphics and sounds, with some 3D cutscenes and voice acting.  The whole game have a good amount of reasonable puzzles and hidden-object scenes, well placed in this shallow but entertaining supernatural murder-mystery-like story. They're pretty logical, you don't need to guess, and you can use the hint system or even pass the hidden-object ones, if you're stuck or it's not your style. You can also play only these scenes out of the story mode.  I had no problems at all on any aspect of this game, so i can easily recommend it, considering you like the genre.",

            "review_text": "'Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden' is pretty much your standard Artifex Mundi casual adventure Hidden Object Game (HOG). The graphics are fairly nice, the story is trite but adequate, the voice acting is mostly tolerable, the puzzles enjoyable, and the Steam Achievements a bit irritating. If you've played any Artifex Mundi HOGS, there's nothing unexpected. Really, the only minor negatives are those Steam Achievements: the HOG and the Dominoes Achievements are mutually exclusive. So, to get 100% Achievements, you're forced to do two run-throughs. And, as usual, since there are no saves, if you mess up, you have to finish that run-through regardless and then do it again. One thing to point out with this game (like a lot of these HOGs) is that it's old enough that the user profile is not saved in the Steam folders or even in the standard Saved Games folder. Instead, it's saved in the hidden folder [username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\ArtifexMundi\\Abyss_TheWraithsOfEden\\CE. So, if you're worried about losing it, make sure you back that up.  I got about 9.6 hours of good game play out of the game (6.5 hours for the first run-through with the Bonus Chapter and another 3.1 hours for the second run-through). So, even at it's list price, the game is close to being worth it. Of course, if you can find it on sale (as I did), then go ahead and snap it up.",

Anyways, the game's got some good atmosphere (courtesy of Bioshock) and a decent plot. The hidden-object games can get a bit tiresome, but hey, there's dominoes too if you don't care for them. Achievement set is a bit annoying in that it requires you to play through the entire game at least twice but ehh, it's quick enough the second time through anyways. I wouldn't call it a top-tier adventure game or anything but it's certainly worth checking out if you can get it cheap.",

I wouldn't call it scary, even if they try to set the mood early on in the game. But it's hard to feel scared when you move by clicking yourself from place to place. The do it as well as you can though. The game features the same quality of artwork that I've come to expect from them. Good ambiance, music and sounds. Voice acting is in general okey, except for a few who went for an oscar and failed. It's not as good as the later titles from Atrifex Mundi, but still a solid game, and if you haven't played the later titles, it's great to start on, to see what they have to offer in the terms of quality.
