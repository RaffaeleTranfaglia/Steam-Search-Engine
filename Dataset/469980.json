            "review_text": "After playing around 2 hours I can say I like the game. I miss classic games with graphics that remind me of my childhood, when playing computer games was done only using the keyboard. I am really sorry I don't own the Steam Controller because I think it would truly enhance the game.  Now back to the game. When I speak of things I like I can name the story, the graphics, the dialogues, the night and day cycles, the hunger system, and the way the mini games are used to complete different actions. For example, if you want to catch fish you need to play 'Guess the number' game and make sure you get the right number, otherwise you'll end up empty-handed.  The bad? Well, there aren't many things I don't like. However, I would point out that if you miss the 'Hint' to press 'M' for the menu you will have to do it just like I did: press every single key on my keyboard until you realize which one is the freaking menu key. I think this should be fixed somehow in future updates (maybe add a message after the game starts).  Overall I really enjoy the game and I hope it gets even better as the story progresses.",
