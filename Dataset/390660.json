            "review_text": "I just checked and Newgrounds still exists, meaning there's no reason to bother with this game. Call of Tomsk-7 is an incredibly simple side-scrolling shooter that puts you in an empty arena to shoot three kinds of monsters until you die. There are zombie things to shoot in the head, bugs to one-shot, and hive zombies to explode before they swarm you with bugs. You move with the A and D keys and aim with the mouse, but without obstacles or more complex enemies you can pretty much stand still and point &amp; click. Well, you might have to dance around because the bullet physics are weak and wonky, leaving your guns feeling more like Nerf armaments lobbing foam balls than actual deadly weapons.  There are outfits and guns to unlock, but they depend on beating certain high scores instead of accumulating points over time. This means it's entirely possible to hit your skill ceiling very quickly, with little prospect of unlocking further upgrades. You have grenades and such to help with your shooting, and airstrikes you can call in if you survive long enough. All of this just helps you last a little bit longer against the same boring enemies. The graphics look like they were cranked out in MSPaint with about five frames of animation apiece, the sound effects lack impact, and the music is some inexplicable garage rock. It's not hard to find free games with better design and higher production values than this, and believe me, I encourage you to find them.",
