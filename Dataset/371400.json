    "description": "Downpour is a hardcore 2D Base survival game. A simple game in concept, but a complexity in practice. Protect an Antenna that is being built from endless enemies so you can contact home. All the while managing closely tied resources. Death will probably come many times.",

            "review_text": "A fun game to look at, not so much play. The tedious slowdown I get when attacking screamers makes for extremely difficult combat, which is essentially the bulk of the game, so it's quite difficult to enjoy. The concept and art style is cool, just the game itself requires more polish.",
