            "review_text": "This game is insanely fun. But it does have it problems. I'll talk about what I love about it and then I'll talk about what I hate.  1, Gangs.  The fact you can get gangs in your prison is great. They'll work together to escape and to kill/fight during a riot or skirmish. I find it perfect that I can section off gang members between cell blocks, And one day open up the doors and watch the murder spree insue, Before sending my armed guards set to free-fire in to crap on the resistance.  2, Mods.  With this game you can see almost anything anytime with mods, I once had a mod that is sadly out of date now, Which set the base agression of the prisoners to near-riot at all times. Me moving one prisoner to another cell set off the entire prison into a rampage. Total death toll was over 400 prisoners, 300 guards and the 5 admins, Whom, Got rushed by gun-weilding gangs.  3, Armed Guards.  The fact I can turn my prison into a DPRK Political Prison is just great. Putting guards in the canteena with free-fire on is possibly the best way to maintain order in my prisons while keeping the quality as low as it can possibly go. No janitors, No health care, NOTHING.  Those were the things I like about this game, Time to get into the stuff I hate.  1, Workers.  The workers get stuck far to often for their own good, It seriously calls into question what the level of education required for their field of work is. I once had about 50 workers stuck behind a wall, and 20 more in another. The sad thing is, When i tried to free them, The oposite set would be assigned to free the other. This lasted 20 mins before i hired 100 more.  They also have a tendency to shove their faces into the edge of the map once you buy a gate, Its annoying.  2, Easy to trigger prisoners.  Now, I did say before that I had a mod that triggered them, But it seems the mod is useless now, The prisoners in this game seem to be like their personality was taken straight from forums dedicated to complaints and petty ♥♥♥♥♥. The prisoners can be set off for litterally walking to far. Its rediculas when you have to kill half your prison beacuse they hate WALKING.  3, Cell Quality.  This is a prison, Not a luxury hotel. Enough said.  I hope yall found this review usefull, At all. Probably not.",

            "review_text": "The Campaign (which also serves as the tutorial) opens with a prison that isn't quite finished yet. And you are told by your boss, the CEO of the 'For Profit' Prison, that you have been given the task of executing a murderer. And this order comes from the state itself.  The game then turns towards teaching you how to work the basic construction tools, explaining power, water, foundations, interior walls, and room basics in a straightforward and clean manner.  Then the game shows you exactly why your prisoner is guilty.  It is not a pleasant experience to watch as a tiny cartoon man walk into his home, find his tiny cartoon wife ♥♥♥♥ing a tiny cartoon stranger in his bed, and then tearfully shoot them both in the head.  This gives us the biggest lesson of all: Prison Architect is not a happy game.  Prison Architect is a top down management game where you run your prison company exactly how you want it. As far as the state is concerned, it doesn't matter how high your rehabilitation rate is, all that matters is that you have no escapes, keep the deaths to an acceptable low, and you keep the prisoners in line by any means you deem fit.  Once you finish your campaign, which takes you through the systems of the game, explaining core concepts quite happily while also telling you tales of loss, pain, murder, ambition, hope, and sheer murderous rage. Of course, the problem is that the game ONLY explains the core mechanics and leaves more complicated ones for you to figure out yourself. That said, while there is a Wiki and many a guide for you, the point of the core game in sandbox mode is mostly to see what works best. To adapt to problems and overcome even of it must be done through trail, error and blood.  The game provides security measures such as cameras, remote doors opened by a button or a timer, stab vests and tazers for your guards, and even heavily armed maximum force response teams kept on site with shotguns, full body armor, and the will and means to paint your prison red with blood at your command. Along with this the game will provide schedules, assignments, patrols, and even resticted acess zoning, all of which is designed to keep your prisoners under control so they do not kill each other.  Along with this is provided many means to turn your prisoners into peaceful members of society if you so choose. You may provide basic education, as many prisoners lack even a child's reading and writing skills. And some of them cannot even read at all, let alone write. Give your prisoners trade skills as carpenters or metal workers. Teach them how to be cleaners or work a laundry. And then set up security systems to prevent prisoners stealing hammers or making crude knives.  Prisoners may come with medical issues such as addiction, alchoholism or violent pshycological instability. Build a common room for AA meetings, an office for one on one meetings for professional mental help, an infirmary for chemical treatmeants to help with addiction and minor surgery when the prisoners try to kill, and a mourge when they do kill.  Your prisoners are humans, with desires and needs, thoughts and feelings, and intelligence. Prisoners need to be fed, and you may give them things to do. Build a common room with tables, television sets, and phones. Provide meals at preset times, as many times as you want, in large quantaties and variety if you want, or a simple bowl of vegetable soup once a day if you don't. Prisoners with many things to do are less likey to cause trouble, and giving them these things may make them very happy indeed.  This does not mean you may treat them like sane members of society. You are running a prison. They are prisoners. And Prisoners are not in the habit of obeying the rules. Prisoners steal, fight, and even kill in your walls. Make no mistake, you and your officers are the only order inside the prison. Without your constant watchful gaze and omnipresent guards the prisoners will fall upon each other like wild animals; killing, fighting, and breaking.  If your prisoners are exceptionally angry, and if your prison is weak enough, the prisoners may decide that they can do whatever thy want and there is nothing you can do about it. They may decide to riot. Or you may subdue them, show them that any antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated, and make them docile through fear.  Problems may arise in your prison, and of course these are optional. Make it so that he game throws problems your way at random. Maybe a highly contagious disease is rampaging through your prison and killing your prisoners. Perhaps a water main has burst. Maybe a generator has overloaded, causing a fire and a blackout. Or maybe the mayor has bowed to political pressure and decided to implement reform without consulting you.  If you feel particularly brave, allow the game to generate gangs, and watch as your prison becomes split by three gangs into territories, and attempt to usurp your authority. And then spiral into gang wars, burn your prison down, kill your guards, and extort prisoners.  Prison Architect, ultimately, is exactly what it says it is, with a remarkable and well made game that most will like. BUt do not expect to laugh because of the cutesy graphics.   They mitigate the horror, but only make it bearable.",

            "review_text": "I would recommend this game since I really like the concept and it's fascinating to see your prison run itself. It gives a bit of a Settlers vibe. However as they consider this game finished (It's not early access anymore), demand 28€ for it and announced the next update to be the last big one I cannot give it a recommendation. It just isn't done yet, and if you play for longer, the unfinished, unrefined and outright frustrating parts - none of which will be fixed by the update - will hit you in the face like a train. I'll list a few of those:  - The temperature system is a complete afterthought and not done well at all. You can only lower temperature by having windows, and raise it with radiators. If your kitchen isn't adjacent to an outside wall, it will overheat constantly, and windows are always open, leading to your prisoners freezing in the winter. Radiators also can't be turned off in the summer. AC? Never heard of it.  - The game rewards badly managed prisons over well managed ones. Prisoner deaths are not punished directly, technically they're even rewarded because they make room for new prisoners. Even if you have failure conditions activated, the chance of feeling actual punishment is low. What is punished are 'incidents', which even a well run prison can barely avoid, especially with gangs activated. I can only say that I tried both, and the prison where I stuffed 300+ prisoners into a 120m² holding cell certainly rolled in dosh.  - The calculations for dormitories have been broken forever. A dormitory with 3 inhabitants and 1 TV doesn't count as '1 TV per 4 prisoners'. You have to have at least, I think, 5 prisoners in a dormitory for the calculations to hold up, which of course increases the chances of the inmates shanking each other.  - Click, click, click, click. This game requires so much ♥♥♥♥ing clicking. The scroll speed is brutally slow so you have to click and drag with the middle mouse button to get around. And the developers apparently never heard of hotkeys, because you have to click to do absolutely anything. There are thousands of management and economy games that did it better. This game will murder your carpal tunnel.  - Prisoner behaviour is disappointingly primitive. You'd think putting the power generator somewhere isolated and under guard makes sense because prisoners will try to sabotage it - they don't. You'd think they try to sneak into the storage room to steal some tools - they don't. I once tried a huge prison full of security flaws - the armory right next to the canteen with no walls in between, power generators out in the open... nothing happened. Not a single prisoner stole a weapon, or did anything else but get into minor fisticuffs with the guards.  - Room assignment is painfully broken. Basically, whenever you add a room somewhere, the game sees it as 'reassign EVERYTHING to Shared' and then suddenly you have max security prisoners in your min security block, cells in unfinished wings being occupied and prisoners strolling around the outskirts of your prison. This is obviously a hyperbole but seriously, you will suffer at least half a dozen escapes from this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  - Deliveries will mess you up. More specifically, mail deliveries. If your prisoners can't keep up sorting the mail, it will at some point just overflow your delivery area. And what does the delivery driver do if there's no more room for his mail? Why of course, he will just stay there and block the road for everything else - like food deliveries or prisoner buses. Solution for this? Click on a mail bag, click dump. Click on a mail bag, click dump...  - The prisoner intake is convoluted and counterintuitive as hell. Something extremely simple like 'Give me 1 delivery of X medium security and Y maximum security prisoners' can't be done. Instead there are 'Fill to X' and 'X per day' settings where the security level is determined in percentages. This has lead to me forgetting to close my prison and ending up with way too many prisoners so often I lost count.  - The way patrols work is frustratingly idiotic. When finished with its shift, a guard will simply leave its post without waiting for its replacement, leaving your prisoners unguarded.  - Maximum security doors can be destroyed. Fences can't. Your prisoners will outright give up any escape attempts if there's a fence surrounding your perimeter.  - The game barely explains anything. I once tried to dismantle an object in a common room - the button just didn't do anything. Only later I found out that this room was occupied by a gang.  - There's no borderless windowed mode.  - And last but not least, the game - or at least the campaign - implies that you have a choice between running a prison based on fear and one based on making the inmates happy. This dualism may make sense IRL but in this game, it doesn't. If you have a prisoner with a certain set of traits, it becomes outright impossible to contain him. In real life, you'd put someone with 300 murders in his portfolio into a small room with no window and a massive steel door, but in this game, someone can destroy such a door with a single punch of his bare fists, then resist several tazer and shotgun hits and take out half a dozen guards. Then get healed up and do it again and again and again. The only way to avoid this is by making this demigod of a man happy, which in turn means that your SuperMax wing becomes the SuperLuxury wing. If this isn't counterintuitive to you, I don't know what is.",

Developers see this and notice that some mods need to become supported by an official patch, and they are implemented. These guys have worked their asses off to prove the Early Access system wrong, and they did. This game is a sucess and proves what backers can do for developers who put their heart into their game.  Game has minimal, if any bugs with vanilla base game. When you put in mods in any game you run the risk for bugs, thankfully the base game experience provides a simply incredible game, one that doesn't actually NEED modifications, but if you want them, plenty exist.

Every Early Access update was a nice step forward, and the 1.0 release definitely feels like a complete game.  Best thing about it, in my opinion, is that this game is incredibly balanced. You can be as harsh as you want, or build luxury suites for your drug dealers and murderers. You can build your favorite prisoner his own home and have staff bring his meals to him while he watches TV all day. All of these are valid playstyles, and will perform well on different metrics.  There are so many different game mechanics going on, but they're all intuitive, and the game's timescale control gives you all the time you need to figure out what to do. The campaign mode also breaks down a lot of the features one-by-one, which makes a great introduction to the game.",

For once in my life i have found a sandbox building game which can hold your hand if you want ,it is easy to play and easy to master it perfectly mixes fun with complexibility weather if your just messing around or being serious no matter what kind of gamer you are caual, pro, a little 11 yr old who has rich parents and sits there shouting at things when they dont go your way, there is something for everyone now thets get onto the pros and cons.  Pros: *its fun and complex *the AI is smart but also has someflaws which can cause some funny yet sometimes annoying bugs *the shear size of area you can have giving you almost no limits *the amount of items in the game as well as the hidden sprites *it has a campaign *the developers are still fixing bugs *you can activate unlimited money at the start of a game *it can be in 3D through an easter egg *the easy controls *ZOOM TO MOUSE *escape mode! *the modding and normal community *the difficulty its perfect *its easy to learn *and above all its fun to play  Cons: *the Ai can be stupid *the developers have stoped the production on the game *its FULL of bugs *you can only get a few hours of game out of a prison  *the character sprites are limited *no multiplayer (could be fun?) *the campaign sucks at points *escape mode is easy if you know what your doing *all of the modders dont have any new ideas   these are all that i could think of in a ten minute period. all though i have named a lot of wrong with the game it doesnt dispite the fact that i LOVE this game, maybe im a little biased however i definatly think that anyone should at leats give this game a shot, its like a simple version of dwarf fortress that i will remeber for a long time. anyway thats all i have to say on the matter, thank you for spending your time reading this review and goodbye!",

            "review_text": "Well, Prison Architect is finally released. I've been with prison architect for a while now and let me say. They haven't let me down. The game used to be really bugyy, filled with little loopholes, AI problems, or simply backed up supply coming in. The core game was always there. For that I stuck with the game. I'll give you a little bit of a summary (?) on the game in general.  Gameplay: As you can clearly see, I've played this game a LOT. Built tons of prisons, messed around with prisoners, built a sandbox prison. I did almost everything. Thing is, I'm still into it. This game is BIG on replayabilty. Honestly I think I've built near identical prisons and they never end the same. The game has been lately centered on randomness of the AI. You used to be able to run the game overnight and nothing would happen. The game has now made it that you will have to pay attention to everything that happens in the game. Riots, drug overdoses, escaping prisoners, angry prisoners, tired guards, you name it.   Mechanics: The game has quite a few interesting mechanics on it. One being that prisoners actually work togethor on trying to escape, or they will constantly try to get contraband. You can choose to let the prisoners sit in thier cells and have the guards deliver food to them or you can let them run around in the yard and potentially get their 'goods' from the fences. Good food, high costs? Small cells or big cells? Armed guards or normal guards? Lockdown or solitary? The game has a lot of choices for you to make for the prison, and a lot of them have a long lasting effect on your game.  Asthetics: The game is very pleasing to the eye to view, eveyrthing is smooth, and they have worked on getting the graphics to work with each other. The prisoners and guards are different from each other; making them not a stereotypical guard or prisoner. Overall I would say that if you are for some reason worried about the graphics/asthetics or whatever you want to call them; you shouldn't have a problem wiht it.  Humor?: Yes, I won't say too much, but once you see some of the prisoner's stories you will get a good number of laughs.  Realism?: I would say this is a pretty accurate simulation of a prison. Prisoners have basic needs, as well as some extra ones like religion or drugs. Metal detectors detect metal tools and not medicine (duh) while dogs will help you with the actual drugs.  Community: The community is a very funny one, and is overall accepting. No infamous sour community calling you a newb or anything. Most people offer their ideas of a 'perfect' prison, and are usually open to give help or get tips.  Sounds: Well, I would say that the sound effects of the game are pretty accurate when you get near a partifcular room. (Eg. Near a cafeteria you hear eating or silverware when near a prisoner working out you hear him working out) I would say they payed attention to detail but I wouldn't honestly expect stunningly amazing music.  True Sandbox: Definetly is a true sandbox, variety of starting options as well as giving you unlimited funds.  Too Easy? Too Hard?: This one game honestly lets you modify your difficulty. If you want difficult you tell yourself only max prisoners and conditions of losing. New to the game? Take in small amounts of prisoners that are maybe minimum and turn of conditions. It is really up to you how hard you want to make it. If lets say you do 'medium' difficulty then you might find that its more difficult if you messed things up early on or are new to it. It may be easy if you are a pro at sandbox games. I would say if its too easy or too hard its probably you and not the game.  Last comments: Thank you all for reading this review I know it was a lot to take in. I would strongly suggest that you buy this game. The devolpers have worked so hard on this game, they've created hundreds of hours of joy for people and have realeased updates pretty regularily.  Rating: 10/10 I will definetly suggest this to someone else and look into their other games.",

The developers released monthly updates along with videos of them discussing the changes and future plans of those updates. I had no doubts in them finishing the game when I paid early access. I wished more developers were like these guys, people would have more faith/patience in early access games if that was the case.   I like just about every aspect of the game. Everything they added I felt was necessary. PA is a great game, and I still recommend it. I feel something was missing from the game though. I still can't place what the problem is. The fact that its just building prisons maybe? Want more depth? not sure... But I really think its the campaign or lack of challenges it has to offer. I feel like they could've added more or done a lot more, with unique scenarios. Sort of like how roller coaster tycoon did. Anyways, I've put a lot of hours in, I still come back to play every now and then. The game is wonderful. The developers are wonderful.

It's a very pleasant and satisfying sim with many great features that create huge depth for this minimalistically stylized game.  Just when you think that you have the perfect, most stable running prison in the world, the inmates take advantage of your arrogance and point out the flaws in your system and kill the mole that was supplying you with information about gangs and escape attempts. This hurts your prison's value, you walk on the razor's edge of being halled off to jail yourself for criminal negligence. For being a sim game it actually brings a huge element of a power struggle between you and the inmates. No other game has played on my ego as much as Prison Architect.  The devs have put in a lot of time and hard work in this game and it doesn't seem like they are about to stop. Even after the 1.0 release they keep updating with new features and balances that make the game more enjoyable, more intricate, and pushes the 'end-game' portion slowly out of the equation.  Each build of this game makes your prison more and more into a living, breathing world. You easily forget about the minimalistic (but beautifully designed) sprites and look at your population and staff as real people.  The AI's actions feel planned out and specifically designed for the prison that you built yourself. Back to the drawing board.  A must-have for any fan of management games.",

I spent around 20 hours playing the game within two days of buying it, the campaign mode absorbed my attention completely, and I felt the campagin teaches you well for playing in sandbox or otherwise.

It has! Brilliant game!  One big big pro to this game is that it actually has a decent story which almost all games of this genre don't have at all, so if you're looking for a 'tycoon' kind of game with the bonus of a good story, give this a go!  I've encountered 0 glitches/bugs so far and it's an all round great game :)  (Also the 'Tutorial' doesn't actually feel like a tutorial but it teaches really well, it feels like you're properly playing the game rather than a borin, dull drawn out process....i'm not even sure if i'm still in the tutorial and won't know till the end of the scenario!)",

I wanted to try it out so damn badly, so when it came to buying it, fortunately for me, it was on a discount. Not that i'd mind the full amount, but who doesn't like a discount?  As i write this review, on June 29th 2016. There are still a couple bugs within the game which i've encountered personally.  1. An item menu got stuck on my screen one time after i'd clicked the plus icon to expand it. I fixed that by simply saving my game and reloading the save. 2. I built extra buildings during the Campaign which i shouldn't have (until absolutely necessary). 3. The CCTV system seems a bit wonky, but i'm quite sure it works. 4. During my own prison-running within the game i was bulk-building foundation-and-furniture-ready luxury cells, and one of which got stuck in the foundation stage, resulting in the cell turning out as incomplete &amp; transparent. This was fixed by placing a new foundation within the exact perimiter of the cell and adding a door of course, so the cell would get finalized. 5. One thing that bothered me was the fact nobody ever told me there was a difference between a foundation and a wall. So. If you're building a huge prison block, but it keeps ♥♥♥♥ing itself up, then there's your reason. External walls: Foundation. Internal walls: Walls.  All in all, a very entertaining game, with a good, decently capturing storyline/campaign.  I'll definitely be on the lookout for more games by this developer in the future.  7/10. Recommended. Pros: It's not too complicated. Micromanagement possibilities. Prison Reform. ♥♥♥♥ yeah. Cons: Bugs",

I build 2 big jail doors on each side of every cellblock, thinking 'no way they'll get through that'. I but everyone on 'lockdown' for good measure and make sure every single cell is filled. While checking cells I notice a single cell is empty.. Weird, I'm at full capacity. But what can one prisoner do?  That was my first mistake.  As I'm firing all my guards / dogs I notice a tunnel dug out of the empty cell. I take 1 armed guard to investigate. Apparently shotguns aren't a solution to my current dilemma. John (who was arrested for buying drugs) stabs my guard to death, takes his shotgun, and keys.  (I didn't know this was possible). John unlocks the other cell doors of most of the cellblock (about 50 people) and ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. For some reason my guards and dogs were stuck behind the gates during lockdown and just sitting there. A bright orange jumpsuit wearing massacre by the name of John proceeds to murder everyone.  The prisoners are armed now. I hire everything I can afford including riot police. I run them into the cellblock (about 90 prisoners rioting now) and sneaky ole John is in the shower with about 10 other prisoners all with guns and they completely blindside my guards. Everyone is dead and about 2 minutes later I get fired.  The military shows up, apparently someone snuck across the road and let the other prisoners go.

            "review_text": "As a huge sandbox genre lover Prison Architect has been on my to-play list for quite some time, and I wasn't disappointed after getting it. It's literally what it claims to be - you are an architect of a prison, with the added pleasure of getting to manage it as well. One would think that there is only so much you can do with such an idea, but in this game it has been executed really well so far.  I honestly did not expect what this game actually offers from it. Apart from a few silly problems the mood and psychology of each individual prisoner in your prison are a very nice touch. Some are more troublesome than the others (and you don't usually know that right away, you have to learn it throughout the gameplay) and some may be something like ex-law enforcement and that will make them get in trouble with other prisoners a lot should they not be watched at all times. Unhappy prisoners obviously cause trouble, and that includes the need to see their family, sleep, entertainment, comfort, so on, but even greatly unsatisfied they will be hesitant to do anything if you put armed patrols around them. Or snipers. That creates a great variety of ways in which your prison can be ran - Do you want to have a luxury Swedish prison with bacon and eggs for breakfast every day or would you rather be in charge of a war prison where your prisoners don't even have beds? It's all there.  Your prisoners will also make greater efforts to escape if they feel unhappy in your prison, while, if you treat them well, they almost can't be bothered to do so. They will take the opportunity if the door is open, but can also attempt things like digging tunnels, or even causing riots. It is essential you design your prison well, because a strategic placement of things like main entrance, armoury or door-control systems actually matters in case things go really bad. You can also assign patrols, put metal detectors in chokeholds, instal phone taps, all sorts of things to ensure your prison is secure and contraband-free (because your prisoners will attempt to smuggle it in A LOT).  There is also a campaign mode but there is not a whole lot to it, really. There is a story going on that one could be interested in but it didn't really catch my attention that much; it's basically a tutorial where you learn how things work. I, myself, just stick to the sandbox.  The game obviously has its flaws, but it's constantly getting improved and it's already more than I expected from a would-seem-simplistic sandbox game. I'd say that if I can get 50 hours into just sandboxing and placing walls around without any purpose then somebody had to do something right.",

            "review_text": "As of Final Release, PA is officially a 'constant revisit' game for me. For those who played once long ago, you may want to seriously consider playing again, considering how many changes they have done (good news, it now also runs with much fewer resources thanks to a fix a few patches ago). If you have not played, and you enjoy sim games that offer some degree of challenge and/or financial consideration, get this game.  A few good points:   AI: The AI is good for this sort of game. The prisoners are hardly genius, but they are crafty. They will arrange drops for smuggled goods, and depending on your prison setup, they will do so in a place where they can grab it as they pass by. They will also do their best to fight and get into mischeif when out of view of cameras and guards.   Complexity: PA hits an excellent point between 'Too simple to be fun (Zoo Tychoo 2)' and 'Too complex to learn (Dwarf Fortress).' It has a basic tutorial, but the grant system used for starting funds is essentially a organized list of prisoner needs, making a true tutorial almost uneeded. Once you master the basics, there are additional options, such as central door controls and cctv cameras, that will allow your prision to become more complicated and potentially effective. Different types of prisoners require different and more complex security, allowing you to go from an easy going low-sec blue coller jail to a max-sec death row full of potentially violent offenders.   Variation: Like the original Zoo Tychoon, PA is a diverse game, in that you can be very creative at what you build (a quick scan of the Workshop can show you the amount of variaty). This adds a lot to replayability.   Respect: The Dev's have treated this game and their customers with respect. This is important, because some of the subjects covered (such as religion and the death penalty) are sometimes touchy subjects. Playing the game, you can see this (especially the death penalty. The system they use is suitably ominous and serious despite the somewhat amusing antics of prisoners at other times).  ",

Is a long-term discovery and joy for someone who likes to be in charge with all the above.  Pros: - I really like the 'needs' bars of the inmates, brings back the Sims feeling; - The daily schedule can be set according to your desire; - You can set patrooling paths wherever you want and restrict access to areas according to your needs; - You can perform research of additional features or helpful financial treats (the research tree is not very complex BTW, it should provide more); - You can have many different buildings for the needs of the inmates or for your employees; - Is up to you to decide how to arrange everything and how to balance everything in your prison, without being forced to adopt only one style or layout; - Training &amp; programs for the inmates. (Employees should also make more courses &amp; activities); - Micromanagement; - Intelligence; - Huge replayability and attractive sandbox mode, where you have complete freedom to decide everything, even without financial restrictions - Campaign mode quite interesting, even if was very short :(  CONS: - Bug: The workers, sometimes, when installing utilities, don't install all of the tasked items, you must verify and redo what's missing. - Dynamic of people (inmates+employees) sometimes annoying because of the bouncing effect (when entering a door, they are bouncing and missing the door, until its speed will reduce. - Power grid capacity - this is actually a huge minus. If you want to expand your prison and the upgraded electric system is almost at its limit, you will not be able to connect another power generator to the same grid, you MUST make a completelly different path for your cables, which cannot intersect with your other power system, otherwise you will have a blackout. - Too little information on the object you place in rooms and the effect they have. - The time frame of the whole day is too fast! Actually, the inmates and the staff are losing a quarter of the time going from one thing to another or waiting for the guard to come and open the gates. If the time would pass half the speed, it would be much better.",

Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",

Hit a point a week ago where I finished a great game and didn't have anything else I was anxiously wanting to start. I noticed Prison Architect with the oldest 'last played' date (from when I bought it) and decided it was time to give it a shot. Now, I'm wondering how many other hidden gems are in my games list.  I started off with the story mode for the first 3 chapters, which gave me a great tutorial on what to build and how the rooms will help my prison. About a dozen hours in, I started my first prison from scratch and I have not looked back. My prison is now worth &gt;$600k on it's second iteration, and I'm about to start again with all that I've learned to build a better prison for many more prisoners.   If you have been curious about this game, play it now! You will not regret it.",

            "review_text": "Very fun game. You have all the tools to find illegal items, to punish prisoners or to make them somewhat happy with all reabilitation programs. Nice and simple graphics, easy to install mods. Doesn't judge you if you haven't fully completed tutorial and went straight to sandbox, because it says to you whats wrong in prison and it's (most of the time) easy to find how to fix it and it gives you time to do so. It's not kind of those real time strategies when game says something is wrong and it's already too late to fix it, unless you're expert on it. Also, while playing I saw a lot of fun things happen, for example prisoner sleeping handcuffed near his pickaxe and he was smilling :D  So yeah, but there are also some flaws, for example on some places game feels unfinished, for example it's too little of explanations on buildings and things you can build, but there is a mod which brings all information from official wiki to the game and it doesn't feel like something is off. Also I spent like a few hours when I finally find out why my prisoners can't make beds, this wasn't written any in game, but I found it on official wiki (before installing mod). So you may stumble upon some things which feels not finished or smth, but overall this game is awesome simple indie realtime strategy.  One more thing, it's to expensive for it's price, so get it on sale. It's nothing new after like 10 hours of gameplay, so only thing that will make you play will be that you'll want to sell your prison and build another, bigger, greater, safer etc.",

The dishes on the tables in the canteen were not being cleaned by the cooks (therefore blocking the inmates from eating?) -One riot guard was left on site with no way of removing him.

Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.  In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.  Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.  Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!  Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.  Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.  Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.  Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).  Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!",

The cooks were even preparing food, taking it to the canteen and serving it, yet I was still told that I still needed to create the items ! even the bin didn't register as built. After a few more campaign resets I had only built the foundations to the Kitchen and Canteen, but that was as far as I could go. Couldn't assign the rooms, couldn't get rid of the foundations. After another reset (no undo options, so if you assign something wrong, you're in trouble) the same kept happening. It was also very difficult to know if you were doing something wrong. It just shows red boxs when you drag to build/remove and you don't get any explanation why.  I have no idea if this is just a bug in the campaigns but the thought of building up a large prison seems pointless if you make one tiny mistake or hit one of these bugs means you will have to reset to a save or to the beginning.

I literally got stuck in the campaign cause my workers were too busy STANDING in a dark building rather than building the damn infirmary or repair the security room as the quest asked (i even placed them on it and moved them on the thing multiple times but 'nah'). The guards usually do as told, but they often just stop giving a damn and start walking around. I had high hopes for this game, but after actually playing it i regret everything. I don't see people complaining about the AI's which makes me confused, the game was literally unplayable, i had to stay HOURS in a situation where i couldn't do anything at all. I hope there's some improvement in the AI's in the future.",

It's more approachable and has a more gradual learning curve than other games of this nature, while still maintaining complexity. Despite that, it's probably going to require more patience to enjoy than most people (like me) can bear. Its key flaws are due to the complexity of the simulation and the user interaction with that simulation.  I kind of burned out on this game. Once I got to the final campaign mission, it really started to feel like a job or a chore. All I could think about while I was playing is all the work I'm going to have to do to get my prison set up, starting from scratch. I'm going to have to figure out where all the rooms should go, what sizes they should be, and I'm going to have to keep on clicking and clicking and pulling up menus to keep on making progress. It really piles on the decision fatigue and, as I played, I just felt a constant reluctance to do what I know needed to be done because I didn't want to have to navigate through all the menus and options and make all the little small decisions needed to keep building.  The key example of this is building a new prison wing. You need to create the foundation, measure out all the cells, build the cell walls, put all of the crap into each individual cell (bed, toilet, and door for each), build the shower, put all the shower heads in, then run wire so that it can reach each cell, run pipe to the cell block, and run small pipes through all the toilets and all the shower heads. Each of these steps involves clicking through menus, deciding specifics like where things go, exactly how big things should be, and how they should connect. Sounds fun? Not to me. It may sound lame, but I'd honestly rather just wave my hand and say 'this area is the prison area', and have things be taken care of for me.   The feeling I get with this game is the similar to the feeling of reluctance I get when I know I need to do my laundry.  So, I would not recommend this to most people. I'd only recommend it to you if you really are into this sort of game - management, simulation, and building. Otherwise, it's just going to demand too much patience from you in order to really engage with it. At that point, you'll probably be left wondering why you don't just play one of the many other games out there that provide more instant and constant enjoyment and stimulation. It sounds fun on paper (as do most simulations), but it just doesn't translate to consistently and instantly fun gameplay, and, for many people, that's all they are looking for in a game.",

            "review_text": "  Prison Architect review     Summary   PA is a great game that puts you, the player, as an architect who has the choice of making a dream prison where the inmates are always happy, or a living nightmare for the inmates. It's a somewhat difficult game to learn, but the learning curve is very short (takes only 2-5 hours to learn) and once you learn how to make thigns work, you look at your past mistakes and realized how you should've looked at some tutorials first. There's many rooms you can build and you will (most likely) need all of them, not having a laundry for 10 days can lead to a riot! You will need to constantly expand your prison building territory (which will make you think who would even has to time to build all of that, just building a simple prison for 50 prisoners takes well over 30 minutes, try to do it with a few thousand) unless you have turned off prison intake (yes, you can choose what type of security prisoner you take in, how much, what the ratio is or turn it off 100%). Riots... I can't get over the fact some prisoners can cause riots from stealing from a building which has 2 layers of electrical fence, 6 metal detectors at the doors, 2 large jail doors, 8 guards on patrol near it and a Solitay door to stop anyone coming inside. Anyway, they can be caused by msot thigns from the inmates not having a shower room to not enough guards, in that case, send the whole military, all the possible paramedics, call in all the Riot Forces, hire 20+ doctors and then hire 200+ Armed Guards to   hopefully   stop the riot and scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of your inmates. There's also modding, you can even make your prisoners grow a   marijuana farm  ... it's quite ironic since marijuana is   illegal   and this is in a   prison   (don't do drugs kids!), so unless it's medical marijuana, then I have no idea who thought this would be a good idea, it's a genius idea!   Gameplay   [Q]How hard is this game? [A] Very hard, think of Death Wish difficulty on PAYDAY 2 while beign an architect and getting riots happening every other hour. That sums up your first hour or four in PA, The building is very unique but also needs some configuration. The only 'fast' way to make a simple prison is to clone 4 (max) at a time. Why is this bad? Because it's too slow, we need a bigger maxinum cloning radius (50 cells should be good enough) to do some good prisons faster. It hits hard when your glorious prison on which ou spent a long time creating just comes crashing down to a simple room thta you could've made in just five minutes.This drags players away from the games' building since it's so confusing. Other than that, the game is excellent! It has a dramatic story (spoiler alert)    especially about this story of a suicidal prisoner who had a family. It teaches you quite something. Also, one of the quotes is, 'it's never too late to change a life, sir'.    (spoiler over) which sadly enough, only had 5 missions which take a maxinum of one hour each.   Final ratings   Originality: 9/10 Fun-ness (???): 7.5/10 Story: 8.5/10 Building: 7/10      I have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.",

It's 12/10 in my books and one of the most well executed sims out there. Rich in depth and fully mod supported (steam workshop) gives this sim 100's if not 1000's of hours of play time.

And then...one fateful day...it all crumbled. I decided to replace the beds in a cell block with bunk beds. I clicked on all the beds to have them removed at the same time, and that was when tragedy struck. My poor, simple workers dropped boxes of beds in the hallways. They were trapped, unable to fix their mistake. The janitors and cooks found themselves trapped in hallways barricaded with beds. I tore down some walls so the workers could get around, but to no avail. I tried clearing the rooms, but my workers were still trapped. As a last resort, I took a bulldozer to the very foundation. And yet, my staff was still trapped by beds. Chaos descended. Anarchy reigned. And I was forced to erase all that I had worked so long and hard for.   10/10 would be rekt by beds again.",

This game is an example of when early access goes right, and support from games leads to the construction of a truly epic final product which the developers could not have done without support from the architecture of financial support and feedback provided by early access.  This game is complex. When you begin you'll be targeting specific grants with your prison, achieving things like building showers and simple security systems. As you progress it becomes remarkably complex and difficult, forcing to plan far ahead when construction new building and cells. But when you build something that works, it is deeply rewarding.  The 1.0 release of Prison Architect, which added the ability to break out of prisons that you and others have designed, added a huge amount of new content to the game. Even before that update Prison Architect was worth the cost, but now it's a no brainer: this is a tremendously well-made strategy game.",

There are massive holes in the game that need to be addressed before I'd reccomend buying this game.  For instance, I have a prisoner who only murders other people. I lock him up, he breaks out and murders someone. I feed him, he kills the guard with the food.  Does that sound awesome? It isn't. Because the game gives you no way of dealing with him.  He's murdered 40 of my guards, and there's no way to stop him. The game won't let me put him on death row for 'moral reasons'.  I keep six armed guards around him at all times. He'll kill one, then the other five will shoot him. Then a doctor will heal him, and we start over.  I've asked around and the only way to stop him is to cheat him into dying, like putting him in a room with a fire.  Isn't that more immersion breaking than ignoring the 'moral consequences' of putting a 40x murderer on death row?",

(&amp; still increasing)  Build your prison is easy, the hard part is maintain the creation that you built. Food, hygiene, family, recreation, freedom, etc etc, which will determine mood of your prisoners. If u decide to be deaf, here comes the great escape starring my little tunnel. Or worst, TOTAL RIOT lead by your legendary prisoners who can snap fully armed guards by bare hands!!!  If you tire for managing prison, how about ESCAPING your own prison. There are ways to escape prison like old fassion digging job, full rambo killing mode, or my personal favor, UNLEASH MY BURNING LOVE!!!! You will find out that your so-called impenetrated fortress is easily to escape like walking out from your own house.  Overall, this game is so freaking addicted, I hope you will not buy it... :P",

Once the game started introducing things like CCTV wires and contraband being thrown over walls or smuggled in through supplies,it's not as fun to control a huge prison with 3 walls and 50 cell blocks.  The campaign/tutorial can even feel overwhelming,by chapter 2 the game already expects you know how to control reform programs and your prisoner's needs,I bought the game by the time they introduced dogs and i still couldn't keep up! Thankfully,you don't need to play through any of the tutorial (besides the first one) to understand the game's basic controls  One thing you'll get a kick out of is the workshop,much like Unturned,there's plenty of prisons you can download to either have fun with or play as a challenge. Hitman:Absoulution made an interesting phrase; Play to create;Prison Architect works the same way with this  Some extra notes: The building system work well,but it's sometime's difficult to make buildings that aren't perfect rectangles. Fires and riots now cause more damage then ever,often forcing you to COMPLETELY rebuild the buildings,which got tiresome when it came to cell blocks or huge canteens. It's near impossible to get any gaurds not doing anything,which would lead to them spending too much time in either the staff or security rooms",

The game is great because there is no main stratagy you just have to find it. The games mecanics are well carfted and have lots of depth. I like how you have choice.You can make a prision filled with armed gaurds and strict polices. Or you can build a reformed one. The core game sandbox mode is amazing and is the biggest part. Escape mode where you escape prisions is more of a mini game but is still fun to play.The cominity is amazing. There are so many mods.

It's challenge isn't in the campaign mode, or even the sandbox, the challenge is consistently fighting with and against the games well implemented and thought out systems.   Gameplay:: Prison Archetect plays like any good simulator should. It doesn't hold your hand, it simply gives you some prisoners, sets some goals in the form of grants, and lets you attack it however you want. Prisoners have a set of needs, from bladder, to hunger, to spiruality and excercise. How you choose to fulfill or not to, is entirely up to you and where this game shines.  Do you create a state of the art detention center? Where prisoners are given a bed, a toilet, two meals a day and an hour to excersize? Along side this supermax housing unit, you may want to put in a medium security section, where medium risk prisoners work, excersize, trade goods and fight, before you deem them too dangerous and upgrade them to supermax. Over the road, you can have a low security section, where you may want to hold some of your less desireables, such as ex police, and prison guards.  You'll be in charge of every facet of these prisoners lives (each individually named with a background written by kickstarter backers).   Graphics:: The game has a simple 2D art style, the animations are well done, and works well overall.  Sound:: Sound plays an important part in the game, not only adding to the ambience of a prison simulation with cries of terror and the sound of clanking doors but is important to tell when something is about to kick off, or already has based on how your prisoners sound. When treated well, you won't hear much from your prisoners, but forget to hire cooks or cleaners for a few days, and you will begin to hear your prisoners rumble and yell before eventually they will riot.   Overall:: Prison Archetect lets you go as deep and as complicated as you want. Giving you full control on how you want to play, it is a true sandbox of creativity with a whole miriad of systems that simply work. Whether it be the water and electricity system, the smuggling system the prisoners use to sneak in weapons and drugs, or simply just how staff combat this with the steps you put in place to control contraband. Prison archetect is not only a deep simulator, it is constantly updated even after release, by a developer who goes above and beyond for their customers long after they've received your money.   9.5/10",

            "review_text": "Let me start off this review by saying if you like city builders or games like roller coaster tycoon etc then you will like this game. However they give you a lack of information in the game. For example I tried to start a program and it won't start . It does not say why. I found out that I had to have work longer. Otherwise I like how the workmen have to build everything. However it can get SUPER annoying at times. Sometimes they get stuck in walls, and the pathfinder in general is kinda bad. For some reason ALL my guards went to the library where there is a door to the staff room. It was a remote door also there was a prison riot. The guards could not do anything because they where at the door. the prisoners broke the fence. A bunch escaped, the CEO called. Three people could not escape or else he will shut it down. All the guard are still at the door trying go into the staff room, three prisoners escape, prison shut down all because of pathfinding. Also nothing seems to be prioritized. The workmen where all cutting down trees and did not go to fix the gates. Also when I build things I find that they just keep cutting down trees. I can make it 'high priority' but that does not seem to work. Then I hire more and they just go cut down trees at the forestry. Whenever I start a task can they just stop cutting down Trees? Ideally I would like to be able to set priority manually so I can have cutting trees be a low priority, kinda like the steam wishlist.  In conclusion I think it is a good game and all of the issues are not with things that will not require a rewrite of the game. (not with the engine or the core mechanics of the game, so they can just add it into the game with a update) I would recommend this game to anyone that likes game like roller coaster tycoon (this game is NOT like RCT world at all, it's a lot better) or games like cities skylines. Personally I like this game and I hope they improve on the issues noted above.",

            "review_text": "This is probably one of the more unique management games I've played. I give it a solid recommendation.  Both the campaign, and the sandbox mode are enjoyable, however keep in mind that you shouldn't dive head first into trying to build your own prison. While it seems quite easy to make money, poor planning can lead to escapes, 'fog of war' can lead to violence/deaths, and if you haven't gotten a brief idea of how big your buildings/foundations should be, you'll soon find you've wasted quite a bit of space and money. This is why 'architect' is the key word, and not 'tycoon.' Yes you make money and manage the prison, but you have to be careful with your designs.  A final note why I highly recommend it to any management/simulator fans: The sandbox mode is definitely one of the more engaging sandbox modes. Not only does it have handy boxes that monitor important aspects (what % of inmates have been fed, how many tired employees) which means not having to open the ledger every few minutes to make sure you're not going to have a riot, but it uses a system of 'grants' to give you a friendly guide to what buildings to make. While this can make the game a bit easier, because you'll soon find yourself awash in cash, it adds a layer of direction that other sandbox modes (Banished, although great, is the first example that comes to mind) don't have. This means instead of the standard extremely hard beginning, then zen mid-late game, you've got a solid early-mid game set of tasks, and then late game can be focused on upgrading (having more max-security prisoners, installing CCTV, remote doors, prisoner workshops etc)  The only issue I've found so far, which I find strange, but I doubt it'll be an issue in 1-3 months time. There's no 'start' screen. Game loads with a new prison. Should I be at fault for this, I welcome a commentor to let me know to rectify this.  Buy it, don't let the graphics fool you, it's 100% worth the price.  ",

Since the start of their time in Alpha (Early Access) they have released monthly Alpha updates for 36 straight weeks, and no these weren't just bug fixes, they added geniuinely good upgrades to the game to make it better every single month. Whether it be adding a room or an object or adding the ability for prisoners to create tunnels under your prison to escape, every single update was of use to the proggression of the game.  The workshop allows everyone to share prisons with eachother which I have done. Which brings welcomed advice from the kind community nurtured by the developers who have taken on board the advice of the players of their game.  In all this game is very detailed in every part of it and although it may seem light harted in its well done art and design, it has a dark and realistic twist to prison life. A very fun game to play and i reccomend it to anyone who likes games like Theme Hospital, Rollercoaster Tycoon Etc.",

Everyone has beautiful houses- and I totally build for 'go big or go home.' Started a new prison just to make this review and revisited the struggles of playing legitly.   Pros  -Learning curves are a must, and they have it... Kinda. It takes a bit of mastery to know what the heck you're actally doing, but if you've got any form of OCD you're already a master in this game. -Want to build for looks? Don't worry, they have an option for that. -Gangs? Yes, gangs. -Custom people made by real people who paided extra money to have custom people to get added to the game? Yep, you got your edgy backstories. Keep an eye out for 'Roleplayer' Peterson, he's my guy. -Did I mention skin colors? Randomly generated aside from custom-made people. You've got dark skinned people and you've got people as pale as snow[LIKE ME, I'VE NEVER MET A PERSON PALER], and then you have everyone inbetween. Thank you. -You have to love some of the names the game will throw at you. -Not too sure if you can still do this in the newer updates, but I'm pretty sure you can go in and give your prisoners custom heads. Yes, you can make the warden have a beard or shave his head completely. Just remember to not change the pixel x pixel radius.. and be at least a little bit good at editing games and filesurfing. -Tazers make the best sounds.  -There is a way you can be increasingly cruel, if your prison has time and money. -Smuggling stuff in? Yep, they can do that. -Reoffending chances are the worst.. and the best.    Neutrals  -LAUNCHES GAME, GAME AUTOSTARTS A NEW PRISON WITH DEFAULT SETTINGS. 'I love you in every way, but please add a title screen someday!' -CANCEL INTAKE CANCEL INTAKE -Why do shovels keep being found by guards in unreachable areas? -I cannot find a reason to have concrete and brick differences. What? Is one stronger or something? I still can't figure this out. -Ehh. All prisoners are male or genderneutral. Great job on the skin differences, but gals should be allowed in prison, too. Though.. I can see a very, very clear reason to keep ladies out of the game. -Armed guards are buffs and debuffs but are required to get a nessary loan? But they.. kinda make your prisoners angry? Like, isn't that counter effective unless you have a ton of them? -Accountants. Why do they need an entire office? -You don't even research anything for about three days in game, and yet you still need to visit the break room? -Staff.. live.. in.. their.. offices.. -We see someone helping us out with the Warden's letter in the beginning and during the torturial. Does he just die or something? Where'd he go? -Little to no nonplayer-based guides on gameplay, had to figure out the CI system all by myself. -Reoffenses? Yeah, send 'em to the /same/ prison. That is totally going to help them! -I'm running out of reasons to complain, please send help.   Cons  -Too good of a game, please keep making more updates.",

Not only is the gameplay amazing, but the graphics are charming and really suite the design of the game. Furthermore, a 'low-end' pc would be able to run it no problem!

            "review_text": "A great game if you love city builders and the idea of managing a prison appeals to you. I've put about 30 hours into the game so far and had my first $1 million prison. I grew up playing Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 and this game reminds me of that game some.  I love how Introversion Studios is continuing to update the game and they will release the full version later this year.  I would not recomend this game at $30 for someone who does not already like games in this genre. But I feel at the usual sale price of around $7.50 it's very worth it.  UPDATE Nov. 2, 2015  I'm up to around 60 hours of playtime now and I have my first $2 million prison with over 350 inmates. Yesterday I expanded across the road for the first time. The gameplay has much variety to it, as you can build the prison any way you want and run it how you see fit. It can be tuned more twoard punishment with many armed guards and basic cells, or the goal can be reform, with many programs to help inmates get relase early. Some prisons are visually pleasing, while others are efficient and functional, but ugly.   On my currnet prison, with 350 inmates and around 200 staff members, I find the game lags some. I have a FX-6300 CPU and 16GB of RAM, but I understand the game runs on only a single core.   The biggest bug I see is installing electrical lines in a larger prison. I have six or seven power stations, and almost every time I add to my power lines I get a 'no route' error. I don't understand that as the work men have a clear route to the work site. Sometimes it'll take me 10 minutes to add maybe 20 squares of power lines, which is very frustrating. I hope IV addresses that in a patch.   I plan to continue playing my currnet prison until I feel it's maxed out. I really enjoy the game, but my wife hates that I spent two or three hours at a time playing.",

I mean graphically this game is dull, it doesnt wow you, and to be honest it seems like one of those builder games that are very structurly linear and dull. Many finer ponts of this game are not explained with the 'tutorial'(which also acts as th campaign) , and then it ends abruptly with you set off into a plot all alone and confused with what your next move is. However this game has kept me entertained for hours on end. I personally debate over and over what the best way to set it up cells and gates, where to place gaurds, the amount of prisioners that are allowed to even be around eachother and ect. With out digressing anymore even with the difficlties or issues i had with this game early on are now my strengths and im working toward a 100 cell max security prision and am pinned down with the building process because i need to change entire structures to hold 2 legendary prisioners that riot and kill every day. So my final verdict is if you are in the mood for a goofy game that has violence and common sense is a must then this is a game for you , building a prision to your exact dimensions and placing the gaurds where YOU desire. This game is not a preset building game but a sadbox fun zone where your only limitatons are you cash(if you dont use infinite funds) and the prision intake. i enjoy this game thoroughly and would say pick it up and try it out.",

You play through five different chapters, all complete with their own unique characters and challenges. However, the best part comes when you get to manage your own prison - freeplay mode. There are many options to customise your game (eg. sandbox, presence of gangs, spawning of random buildings) to make it all the more fun, while the plethora of rooms, objects, characters and prison management will keep you entertained for hours.

It has become almost impossible to keep prisoners happy. They won't eat or shower and then complain about being hungry and dirty. They won't visit their families who have been waiting for them for hours. They won't excercise or go watch the plamsa screen that's in the common room and they'll b and moan because they don't get enough recreation.

I do however love this game and me pointing out mostly bad things does not reflect my view of this game as a whole. In my opinion they're merely the things most easily talked about. Although I have only put a mere 13 hours into this game, there's stuff that bothers me and in my opinion ought to be said. First of, I really do like this game. I think the style combined with seriousness of the content of the game itself balances one another out well and the amount of simplicity still keeps this difficult enough to not let you tab out while playing this, because, well, this will go wrong quite soon.   1. While playing I have have however run into quite a number of glitches and broken things. For example: sandbox mode, even though an option in the menu does not work. You start out with the same 30k money you always do.  2. In the last game I played I had to throw away half an hour of work because the doors simply would not close for some reason, so no prisoners could be held in any room.  3. Every time I start up this game it tells me I'm going to be asked for the key (verification code) and to copy it (ctrl+c) but after playing this game for 13 hours and about twenty startups I've yet to be asked to verify anything yet am still offered to copy the key every time I start up.   Do make sure that when you play a game you have random events on, because if you don't and you've got a stable prison the only thing you can do is expand, which when so far in the game is very easy and does not take any skill. Just make sure there's a fence around it and it's all good. Have yet to finish the campaign, though, so who knows what I'll learn or come across during that.   I would most definitely recommend this game. If you like god-games then this one is a lot of fun, whether you learn through the campaign or not. Will be playing it a lot more, although the way I want to play it mostly (sandbox mode) does not work.",

Hours of time can be spent in the planning process alone, before a single prisoner even arrives. The replayability is through the rough and the fact that the game just dumps you in makes you fully explore everything in the game. 10/10 would recommend, especially fans of games like Zoo Tycoon or RollerCoaster Tycoon. For your first prison I highly recommend not reading a guide or looking anything up. It makes the experience a hundred times better IMO!",

The tutorial is poor on some aspects for example telling you what the final objective is, but not telling you the path to complete said objective (you have to google).   So it takes a bit of effort to get into, it's far from casual game, and the level of micromanagement you can have is insane at times. and when you have a full scale riot in the prison where you completely lose control of it the game turns into a rts game controlling riot teams, to slowly claim back your prison.   The game also allows you to to shape the prison as you want, do you want to build a prison that goes by the book, trys to help prisioners to get better in life, teaching, etc, or, you could build a prison on cutting costs of janitors and get armed guards to control the angry prisioners with very poor sanitary conditions.    The game also allows you to be corrupt (haven't actually got to this point) bending rules, and creating off-shore accounts to avoid taxes.

When you actually start a game up though, make sure to get yourself 'Grants'.  Grants are basically just Quests that give you the money you need, and set a basis for what you should have in your prison. Most of your income will come from it at first.  Also I recommend not using the default prisoner income, I do about 6. Also make sure you have proper security if your taking on max security prisoners, some could have the 'extreemly volitial' triat, and will regularly kill people, attack people, destroy things, etc.  The game is a lot of fun, if you like tycoons and managing stuff, this is a must have.",

The game is really time-consuming and requires alot of planning ahead when building your prison, though you can sometimes get away with quick, smart, on-the-go kind of thinking. The game can be played at any pace though, since you can turn prisoner intake on and off and also regulate if you want to take in high-risk or low-risk prisoners...or something in-between.  I don't usually write reviews for games but this one really earned a thumbs up from me and I'll likely update the review later as I play more.

The tutorial campaign has scenes of sex &amp; violence. Regular game has avatar nudity for showers and avatar fights/death though you often miss them unless you stop playing the game to look for it.  It's a prison building simulator with a short campaign, free/sandbox mode, and a basic escape mode.  The campaign serves as a tutorial that teaches only the basics. It's only 5 episodes so story is compact, like a framework to a more epic story, showing only the key/best parts. There are several mini-storylines where characters drop out of the story and you never hear from them again.  Grants make a nice quest system to give you objectives you aim for when developing your prison. The money rewards make improving/expanding go smoothly but when the grants run out it's up to you to make your own goals. The end game is up to you to make fun for yourself.  In escape mode, you control one prisoner and try to escape via foot or tunnel, quietly or armed. You can choose any prison (one you make or one from the workshop). It's a very basic mode. You don't need to follow the schedule with other prisoners. Don't need to fulfill any needs. The guards ignore you unless you do something blatantly wrong so you can just fight for more than 2 skill points, get arrested, then use one point to automatically skip the punishment wait and repeat until you max out skills.  Edit: A proper escape mode is like the game 'The Escapist' which has that but no architect simulator.  One thing missing here that I remember in other simulation games (like RollerCoaster Tycoon and Big Pharma) are scenario challenges where you clear a target objective within a certain time (or have other specified goals).  Worth a try if you enjoy simulation/tycoon games.  Other thoughts:    Programs usually autoassign staff and rooms okay but when it doesn't work there's no easy way to fix things. Sometimes dezoning works.    People walk over objects so seems like empty spaces are just for aesthetics to make things look nice.    There should be an indicator (arrow, box, etc.) to show where an object is interacted with (for example, an ironing board needs to be approached from the bottom so it can't be blocked off with a wall). For whatever reason the game doesn't let you fully rotate these interactable objects which means you can't place it as you might want.    There are keyboard shortcuts but there's no way I can find to change them or see the list of what they are.    It would be nice to be able to label rooms while you're planning to help keep track of your layout.    I would've liked the objects menu to be searchable by room and have room tabs to display things useful to the room.    The clone feature is nice but it would be nice to permanently set a template design to quick build later across any save. You can do it manually outside of the game but would be nice to use the in-game UI to do it easily.    I think it's a little weird that you start with a positive cash flow without any prisoners. It means that if you don't care about the time spent (there's no reason to) you can save money at the start by not buying workmen and instead fast forwarding time so you gain more free money before your expenses kick in.    I think it could be interesting for an option to have outside inspections (from the government, etc.) that you need pass occasionally.    There are certain things that should be in UI that you have to look up in the wiki (ex: what affects max jobs in a room, how are license plates made). Even if it's intuitive, it should say what needs the object fulfills (and if certain objects fulfill needs better than others).    There should be a way to reposition objects rather than wait to dismantle then replace.    It would be nice to watch replays of big events that happened (like escapes, possibly fights) because you usually miss the start of it.    It would be nice to click on a need and see a list of prisoners that you can click to zoom in on. That way you could watch and figure out why they're don't getting that need fulfilled. For example, you could figure out who isn't being fed and why (ex: not fed because missed eating period because in lockdown/solitary or unable to be placed in a cell).    There should be a way to prioritize actions involving inmates. I had two injured inmates in the infirmary and the doctors just stayed on the other side of the room, pacing for hours until they got around to healing one and then (hours later) the other.    There are some visual bugs (door shown always open even though closed, todo list required toggling windowed mode to fix the background).    It's interesting that the game doesn't start with a main menu; it automatically begins a game on default settings. If I didn't explore the menu I'd never have known of the options you can choose when starting a new game (like picking a warden with a global effect).    There should be better sound controls. The arcade isn't a required object anywhere and I don't purchase it simply because it's annoying to hear the sound effects constantly.  ",
