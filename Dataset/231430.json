            "review_text": "Being a huge fan of the CoH series and a top tier player I aim to give a balanced review and dispell the undeserved negative user reviews. Please note this is my first proper review and any feedback is appreciated =).  Do not be fooled by the hateful meta critic user reviews that score the game incredibly low. These are all largely due to patriotic Russians who exaggerate and claim the devlopers are Nazis as the campagin portrays the Soviet Union in a bad light. One such scene they are particularly angry about is when retreating russian soldiers are being shot down by their own machine guns. Granted Relic could have portrayed these horros of war better so that they could not be misinterpreted but they didn't set out to shame an entire nation. What the campagin really shows is the the story of the war through one man's eyes, showing the great bravey of the typical russian soldier under a ruthless poltical system and an equally terrifying invading German army. Which probably took more courage to do than that of soldiers from other countries.   For those who worry about Pay to win I can assure you it's entire nonsense. None of the new content is aimed to give players an edge in multiplayer. Obviously when it is first introduced there might be some balance issues here and there but these are quickly resolved. The idea behind DLC is to give players more varitey, be that with skins or commanders it's down to your personal preference and you are no way forced to buy it to be able to compete.  I can say that although CoH2 does not possess that same unique feeling that vcoh had, it is still a remarkable and incredibly fun game that continues to get better with each passing month. I have personally played over 600 hours on the beta and current version combined and I still find new ways to play and each game is never the same. You have to remember that the orginal CoH series has had 7 years of patching and improvements whereas CoH2 has only been out for less than a year. Therefore I believe it's unfair to judge the sequel so harshly at this stage. Within that time period the developers have added a huge range of content including; Steam Workshop with user created maps and mods, offical developer created maps, new units, commanders, leaderboards, chat rooms and with plenty more on the way.  Notable improvements over the original include: Better Graphics, Bulletins, Variety in choices that makes you stand out from the crowd ie commanders, skins faceplates etc, New Features like Cold Tech and True Sight which add more tactical elements. For instance you must now keep your troops warm during a blizzard by placing them near a fire or in a house otherwise they will freeze to death.  Now on to the game's flaws. Currently I believe the developers are pre-occuiped in bringing out more dlc content then spending the most time balancing the game and improving performance. Fair enough that they have to make money but I'd much rather they focused on tweaking the current game first then adding dlc like theatre of war missions. The variety in commanders is great and all but loads of the abilities have been reused in other commanders which takes away the uniqueness of certain commanders. Theres still quite some work to do before it can be considered a proper ESport as the replay viewer still needs additional features however it is constantly improving. Compared to something like Starcraft 2, CoH2 just doesn't have the player base or the resources unlike blizzard. I honestly think that if relic promoted the game and advertised it properly it would have generated a lot more interested. As it happens the advertising around the launch date was literally non-existent.  Conclusion  Score: 8/10 Current State  Although this game has got a way to go before it can be considered to be a worthy sequel to the first, I believe that over time it will get there and even surpass it's predecessor. Relic has been listening to user feedback and many of the new features are a result of this. So if your either a fan of the old game or looking to try out a proper real time strategy then look no further. I cannot recommend this game enough.",

It's the only RTS that i can play for hours and not get too bored. But my only problem really is the lack of maps in the game (with out using workshop content) if feels a little empty as far as good maps go and the modeling is good apart from the brits with late WW1 unit skins . Other than that i'd say its worth the money the overall unit command works well 10/10 from me",

            "review_text": "Not realy your classic RTS formula, resources gather automatic no need for harvesting, but they can be increased by capturing points and building resource points. Units can reinforce if close to a reinforcement point, lil like the wh40k unit system. Besides that unit variety: a lot. Even more with custom mods. Campaign ya well, wish there was also a German campaign but overall it's decent. Additional campaign with Ardennes offence wich is also pretty decent.   Game can crash sometimes when loading the after match report but that doesnt happen too often. If you've played CoH1 then this one will not dissapoint, except maybe for the great ammount of dlc for sale (also mods for that lol).   Online players are usualy friendly and most of the time u will have an enjoyable match, of course u will also encounter the few unpleasant exceptions to that. Good thing also: theatre of war, custom missions that can be played solo or coop.   Only downside for me is the loot system wich is pretty much random play for 10 min or play for an hour, win or lose u never know when the loot is going to be coming your way.   Difficulty: easy (real easy) the ai doesnt even move unless you strike first, normal the ai only moves when you capture a point, hard the ai comes for all your base, and fast, expert u need to be faster then the ai with everything because otherwise f*ckin forget about it, u dead. So would say difficulty is well done.  Advice: vanilla (standard) is maybe not the best experience but with some custom skins and tuning packs its well worth it.",

This is one of the best games I have ever played. I like it much better than the first COH. Once you become a dedicated player and really understand the game, there is no going back. If you come from the first coh it does take some getting used to but overtime you will start to realize why COH2 is so much better.  I can't think of a better game out there and I am addicted to COH2. I can't wait to get back and start playing again.",

The game itself is odd in the playstyles that you have to use to win/loose, but overall its fun- especially with friends. I'll quickly list the Pro's and the Con's and move on with life.  Now starting out with the game itself the Singleplayer is something you want to stay away from, since it's disgustingly inaccurate in a sense of historical terms and how the Soviet troops were treated, essentially it's a pile of ♥♥♥♥. ON THE OTHER HAND the multiplayer is pretty nice with the maps and gameplay styles that you'll have to use depending which side and country you are on. The maps are consistantly different which is good in a successful RTS game.    Now back to the gameplay styles and statistics as I stated before its all up to who you are, Axis or Allies. Depending who you are you'll have to take many things into context including the map, which commander you've chosen and who are you allies (If not playing 1v1). Continuing with that communicating is a major thing since if you are trying to do a spear push to middle point and your the only one doing it, that's pretty bad teamwork. Along with saying that the Allies are VERY WEAK if you are in a 2v2 or above match and you do not work together, since if you think about it The Big Three (US, UK, Russia) worked together to push the Germans back and end the war? Well it works the same in here, if you have a US and Soviets and they try to independently take points it can work, but without helping each other in the late game they will truly and utterly get massacred and loose.   Now the technical things, the AI can sometimes be stupid, but it works and isn't as bad compared to many other RTS titles out there. The DLC is really nice and pretty good, but the prices I think are way to high- get them when they are on sale instead of full price. Then within the game are the micro-transaction ♥♥♥♥♥ which but don't leave out, skins, commanders, faceplates, and bundles! Which are all over $5.99 and $5.99 is the cheapest the 'bundles' come in. Also majority of the time within the game it is Axis sided if you don't know what your doing- as in if you make one fatal mistake there goes the game. It's weird.   In total however the game is truly worth the buy, especially if it's on sale! The game is full hours of fun with or without your friend playing in a PVP manner. The DLC's are also worth it if you get tired of playing only Soviets and Wermacht, but the drops you can get after playing a game can spice things up with the abilities that they have to offer. So yes I rate this positive since it is truly a fun WWII RTS Game.   Have fun, and happy hunting!",

            "review_text": "I really loved COH and I also like COH 2 despite it's weaknesses.  First of all, the game has great graphics and game mechanics. Especially on 4v4 MP matches this games become great on the endgame when you have tank battles like in kursk and you fight for every point as your tickets amount become low. You then face a sometimes little disturbing battles where many soldiers die for holding this point and you realise how hard war can be when a single salve of artillery fire kills 20 of your brave elite soldierts who did everything to follow your order.  The singleplayer is also nice and I really wish they had spent more effort German and allied campaigns.  Pros:  + Great RTS with many options and ways to achieve victory + Cool mechanics and graphics + awesome atmosphere  negs:  - Bugs (they are plenty of them) - Devs. not caring about bugs and prefering to sell more useless skins on 5 GB updates every week - every replay you save will become incompatible with every 'skin update'...... - Not very popular, it sometimes takes ages until you find a MP game to join in  Conclusion:  I love this game despite the bugs and greedy devs not caring at all. It would be nice if a company like blizzard was behind this project, then we would get a gaming experience that reaches levels you never expected but sadly, this will never happen.  What ever, I'd buy again, but not the CE as I spend more than 100 € for it to have to buy every single DLC for like 20 - 30 €... Greed over quality.",

            "review_text": "For those who have played COH1 and are still on the fence about buying this game, this review is for you:  When I first purchased COH1, it was love at first sight. With 6 compelling campaigns and awesome mods and maps to play with after getting bored with the vanilla version, I got hooked real quick, I probably spent a good 200+ hours playing it off and on for the past 2 years. The campaigns had the same feeling as the first 2 Call of Duties mixed with a hint of Band of Brothers.  Since I loved COH1 so much, I decided to disregard the enormous amount of negative reviews and get it anyways.  COH2 is originally set on the Eastern Front, which suffice to say is better than the Eastern Front mod for COH1 in so many ways. Mainly, I like COH2 more because it comes with a great campaign, and doesn't require you to force restart your OP PC every time you try to boot up a game.  That being said, the campaign storyline in COH2 was a little better than if you compared them side-by-side with any of the COH1 campaigns. It felt a little more cheesy and CoD-ish than Brothers In Arms: EiB, but the same general attitude was used with great effect and had me compelled to play through the entire campaign in one sitting.  Then there are of course the countless DLCs that come with this game. Mainly, most of these are microtransactions, where now instead of doctrines, there are commanders. As for the other, more formal DLCs, there are 3 more factions to choose from if you get them. Also Ardennes Assault brings a new kind of campaign that is extremely different from what you'd normally expect, It's sort of a Turn-Based strategy on top of the base game that plays differently each campaign, with 'special events' where you can unlock certain vehicles for certain companies throughout the game. And then there's also mission packs, which can provide you with maybe 30 more hours of fun.   So all in all, would I recommend this game? I personally would, but only if there is a really good sale on it. The microtransactions kind of turned me off, but it wasn't gamebreaking for me. The campaign is good too, and for some it can make you walk away from it questioning your own moral integrity. Hope this helped!",

            "review_text": "EXPLAINING MYSELF Before I start my review,I will say that I played the first Company of Heroes with all its expansion packs(Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor) and that I had a rather enjoyable experience.The factions were diverse and unique and the campaign had some challenge in it.The multiplayer was the epitome of multiplayer strategy.  ONE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER So,what does Company of Heroes 2 offer that its predecessor doesn't?Well,the setting is different.Eastern front in the center of the game,therefore Ostheer(East German army) and the Soviet Red Army are the available factions to play as.The Germans have smaller squads but are generally superior in equipment and training(e.g.the Panzergrenadiers can be upgraded with Panzershreck to eliminate armor,none of the Soviet infantry has any upgrade to do so).The Soviets have larger squads,which gives them better chances to survive and reinforce(except the Engineers who have 4 and Sniper team who has 2,the rest of the Soviet squads have 6 men).  NICE,BUT HOW DO YOU PLAY IT? The gameplay is the same as in the last game;capture point to get resorces and don't let the territories get cut off from your main base.However,instead of some points offering munitions,fuel or manpower, most points offer both munitions and fuel(in a smaller amount) with some offering just fuel or munitions but in a higher amount.Those that offer both may be secured to either increase their munitions or fuel output(but not both).Tactics such as taking cover,flanking,suppressing and vehicle positioning are important to win battles,since a heavy tank can be defeated if engaged with a AT gun while the bazooka team flanks and attacks his weak back armor.Overall,it's the same game,but...  LET IT SNOW The snow ain't just for aesthetic purposes.Heavy snow can slow down both infantry and vehicles,and in some situations your men will freeze to death if they are not in a building,vehicle or near a fireplace.Blizzarrds may occur at random(you will get a warning and a timer telling you how much is left before it hits).It lowers the sight range of all your units,while freezing the men,forcing you to take care of them.Vehicles and men leave marks on the snow so you know if someone passed there and where he went.  YURI,WHAT DO YOUR BLUE EYES SEE? Tue line of sight is implemented in this game.In simple terms,your units cannot see behind walls or through trees,making ambushes a potent tactical solution(the first game didn't have true line of sight).It is a very fun mechanic that I haven't seen since the games of Stormregion(Codename:Panzers and Rush for Berlin).It makes scouting a neccessary maneuver to your strategy and smoke screens a life saver from artillery and machineguns(my Soviet Shock troops saved a lot of my men with their smoke grenades).An excellent addition to the game.LOVE IT!  WANT TO GO TO A THEATER? Theater of War is and addition to the singleplayer portion of the game.You have solo challenges and coop scenarios.These can vary from officer assasination,holding a position,eliminating a armoured column during the blizzard and so on.It extends the life of the game and if you have a friend,some of the scenarios you can play with him.  COMPANY OF FUN The multiplayer is so fun I don't know what words to use.It's immersive and action packed,but smart action.You need to make decisions fast and smart to win.The user interface really helps here;on the bottor right you can select the production buildings,set a rally point and order a unit to arrive.this is important in the early stages of the game,when deployment to the frontline is crucial.The various maps also help in this,considering that they are different in sizer and terrain.  SINGLE IS COLD I played the first three missions of the campaign and didn't continue because I ran out of time(I played this during the free weekend action).The campaign is inferior to that from CoH1.Whil CoH1 displayed the Americans,British and Germans as normal people doing their duty,the Soviet army men are portrayed as cowards who shoot their own men in the back.True,attrocities were made by the Red Army and the methods they used were brutal,but htere must have been some heroic moments.Sadly,the campaign doesn't show that,and the way the story is presented doesn't help.It is told via a flashback,which makes it feel detached from reality.Add in that the focus is on the bad side of the Red Army(and that the Germans are nothing more than obstacle,rather that a force),while showing nothing bad about the German army(they did attrocities,no army is safe from that) adn you get and rather empty and almost surreal story that is hard to believe or take serious.  COMRADE,WHAT IS THE CONCLUSION? Company of Heroes 2 is an excellent strategy with excellent multiplayed balancing,a sizeable singleplayer content and a dull campaign story.If you're buying it for the multiplayer,you won't be dissapointed.If you're buying it for the challenges,missions and scenarios in th Theater of War you will get a kick from it.If you're buying it for and interesting story then you will get dissapointed with it.

However, like those mentioned games, this doesn't feel incomplete. It doesn't feel like any important parts were cut out and held for ransom. The game, stand alone, without DLC, is excellent.    I didn't spend a dime on DLC, never will. I enjoy the game as is, it's fun. The gameplay style is unique from what I'm used to, coming from Command and Conquer series at the time. Instead of rushing your enemy or rushing for flanks, you're really rushing for choke points and trying to hold them. I suck at this game.  I do have some complaints though. Why is there no sell unit option? Why not give units the ability to flee the battle when at HQ for exchange of a little refund and your unit cap being replinished? It always feels weird sending units to their deaths in order to build something better. Also, an update did the saddest thing ever for me! They implemented build limits on IS2 tanks! Why? I Know the spam was real, I admit it was op... but why not punish me for it instead of simply banning me from doing it? What if you increased the costs for every additional unit, or build time, something!   regardless, it is an excellent game, especially with friends. DLC isn't worth it though, save your ♥♥♥♥ing money.",

            "review_text": "I remember being sad and angry with the choices Relic made when playing the beta of this game while still being very much a fanboy of the original. Bought the game after it matured a bit and saw it for what it really was. An, allthough not exactly the same, experince akin to the original COH. An RTS with focus on smaller engagements and zero to none focus on basebuilding. Good grahpics, physics and a steep but very satisfying learning curve.  Good game for just wanting to build giant tanks and artillery and utterly destroy the enemy in a compstomp or to really get your tactical/strategic itch scratched in very tense and stressfull 1 on 1 matches in automatch. Downside of the game is the multiple DLC. The new factions offer more than enough of new contact, however each faction has extra commanders as well which in theory you can get by playing the game for free... this will take some luck and a lot of time. If you want to play a specific commander, be prepared to spend some extra cash or invest a lot of time.  It took some time, but this has become a game not onyl worthy of the name 'company of heroes' but has also added on to that legacy.",

It's a whole new interactive gameplay--from units to maps to missions. The basic game commanders as totally adequate for adding a lot of variety (which vCOH had only 3 choices) via the commanders. Buying the DLC just enhances the options though in few cases adds newer units or abilities. Personally, I like this--buy it if you want it approach.   COH2 deliveres a lot a fun, tense gameplay. Truesight, weather tech, and new infantry pathing abilities, along with a dynamically changing battlefield, really creates some great gaming. (Oh, vehicle pathing is still somewhat spastic.)   The asymetrical balance is somewhat daunting to learn (much like the Brits once nerfed), with the Wehrmacht being most similar to vCOH. Here the game made some subtle differences that makes the Wehrmacht somewhat easier to manage (without micro-managing). The Soviets, however, are fun but exasperating to play (to some degree like the Americans in vCOH). Soviet teching is not at all linear or even possible in many matches, given the massive bleeding inflicted by losses. Yet, once you've learned what combination of Soviet arms to cobble together, the Soviets really give the Wehrmacht a run for their money. Ultimately, a Soviet player has to be far more descriminating and anticipatory in what units to produce than the Wehrmact, since an early Panzer or Ostwind can ruin an otherwise good game. Likewise, the stronger Wehrmacht tanks can't afford to get ahead of infantry support. Hence, Soviets arms typically dominate the Wehrmacht infantry, whereas the Wehrmacht tanks can outlast most Soviet armor. It's a truly asymetrical theater.  COH2 is a great game. Sequel-like but not a sequel. It's got numerous improvements (and differences....even when vCOH had some better aspects) that make COH, well, a bit old.   Cost of the buy-in is definitely higher; but the fun factor (for me) is worth it! Bigger than that, is the hardware requirements to run this graphic hog. But if you've got the gaming system that can run it, I'd recommend that you try it. It's not a FPS, but it's an awesome RTS.",

All the military nations are balanced out nicely, with the odd insane almost near invincible german war machines ( Elphant and Tiger II ) But, with the right artillery, and armor... they too can be beaten... and its a bigger loss for them...than for you. Very versetaile game, if you choose to stand your grown and defend you can do that easily, do you want to steamroll the enemy with awesome display of offensive maneuvers be that with airborne troops, artillery or armor... or commandos... circling maneuvers and the lot... im tired and cant write properly... but still took time to write this review :)",

            "review_text": "Basicallly, If you liked the orignial Company of Heroes then you should enjoy this game. It brings the focus to the eastern front and (if you havn't bought the Western Front Armies) you are given two main factions, the Whermacht and the Red army. Each plays indvidually and while it does share many similarties with the original CoH, it brings a new element by giving you mutliple options for commanders who operate similarliy to the commanders from CoH. It also utilises a new sight system, the abilitlie to climb walls and things like Blizzards which can your troops from hypothermia or deep snow/mud which slow down all units considerably. The graphics are also considerably improved.  Sadly, this game is plagued by microtransactions, Some very OP commanders can only be bought as well as countless other asethetic things. However, they have tried to fix this problem with the war spoils system, although this still doesn't really fix this due to the rareness of the drops. I personally did not like the campaign and the theater or war missions are either too boring, too hard or too expensive. There is also a constant majority of German players, however if played correctly, either faction can be very strong. With the arrival of the DLC, there is many changes to the base game like new UI and customization system, but the new factions don't feel ... new, they just feel similar. Also, the common Commanders of the Americans are flat out rubbish compared to the oberkommando, in fact, I really wanted to see to more variety in commanders for all the factions rather than a small set with each with lots of really cool, fun looking commanders sitting in the store page.   Overall, I do enjoy this game, but I honestly still prefer the original CoH, I have sunk many frustrating hours into this game, but with the preogressions sytem now rendered useless, and many fun commanders (like the Kv-2 one) sitting beyond my wallets reach, I am not sure for how much longer I can keep playing. Be careful when purchasing this, for 29.99 (as of the release of this review) you'd be better off buying the DLC wich still lets you play the game with more intresting factions. Out of 10, I disapointdley must rate it at no higher than a 7/10. But, I must empahsise, I do enjoy playing it! ",

But i'll start with what I love about this game. It's a refreshing change from CoH, switching focus from the United States forces, to the Red Army. It's a nice switch from the traditional WWII soldier, to Russian conscripts. We have a nice change in vehicles and unit upgrades, as well as units. Not to mention, fighting against the notorious harsh weather elements of Russia is also very immersive. There's nothing like trying to prevent your men from getting hypothermia during a blizzard while fending off Wehrmacht panzers spitting fire and platoons of storm troopers, machine gunners backed by mortar crews! Aside from all this, there is a pretty darastic change in the CoH we know and love. The dreadful 'microtransaction' has made a needless appearence in this excellent game. Now, if you're one of those saps who love paying 1-3 USD for cool skins and such, search no more. But regardless, those in-game purchasable items are, in my opinion, completely dumb and useless. The other new feature I strongly dislike is the fact you need to unlock Generals and customize them. There are lots of 'em, and if you're new to the series, it could be a bit overwhelming at first. You can now pick your generals and select from a VERY large variety of unit 'perks' if you will. All of these 'perks' are ranked such as common, rare, legendary, etc. And they pretty much add a bonus to a specific unit. Dumb, but it doesn't ruin the gameplay. And that's why I can comfortably recommend this game to someone else.",

Company of heroes 2 is a good game but dont live to the legacy from the first game. Company of heroes 2 when it came out felt like the game is unfinish, with only 2 armys, some maps and some tweeks in the gameplay. They realase the game unfinish for you next buy loads of DLCs to complete the game. Its kinda like the sims 3 with the sims 4, you have sims 3 completed with all can you imagina and next they launch sims 4 unfinish for next lanch a bunch of DLCs to complete game. Company of heroes 2 is the same thing. This game still Company of heroes but misses lot of stuff from the first game. The gameplay is identical with some tweeks, 2 armays and new maps. What i hated about this game is the m,ain game only have 2 annoying armys for you listen all the time! Its germans and russians, always speak russian and german all the time... You cant understand nothing. This game is also hard and the friendly IA somethings is really dumb can make you really angry lol. But overall the game is good but not as good as the first one. If you like the first one you will like this one. But be aware this game needs a lots of DLCs for you enjoy it a lot! Because you get stuck only with main game you will get bored like hell... And listen that russian? Man is really annoying.   Review: 8/10",

To sum it up you have USF (United States Forces), UKF (United Kingdom Forces), the Soviets (namely because I don't remember what they are called in game), the Wehrmacht (glorious German defense force), and the Oberkommando (more glorious German soldiers).  Each faction has it's own perks (but if you ask me UKF is the most annoying), and you start off with Wehrmacht and the Soviets. The DLC is a bit costly but if you go to sites like ♥♥♥♥♥ you can get the full game and the majority of its DLC for a good price. Last I checked one of the major bundles was a 26$ pack that came with the full game and a bunch of DLC which allows you to play as the other factions.  Pros: -Tons of fun -Skill oriented -Good knowledge = good games -Has Germany -Displays the glorious Iron Cross -Has the wonderful German engineering (as well as other nation's pathetic attempts at making tanks and whatnot) -High replayability -High learning curve as it requires more knowledge than other RTSs  Cons: -High learning curve as it requires more knowledge than other RTSs -Germany is not OP atm -UKF is annoying as hell -Costs a lot to access everything in the game if you don't use sites like ♥♥♥♥♥ -You might spend too much time playing instead of doing what you should be doing -Germans/Lovers of Germany get called Nazis from time to time despite not all of Germany being filled with Nazis. That was primairily the Waffen-SS, people. -Your first games online will be tough as the gaming community isn't as big as it could be so there are a lot of fully leveled vets in game. -Bulletins improve your army, but atm it is a random drop system and you can't choose what you want to get. (On the bright side Relic has said they will be changing the system soon so this con will eventually become obsolete. -You can't play as Germany in the campaign. -RNG can be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ from time to time. -Recommending a site that lowers what you pay for the overpriced microtransactions is not okay according to this place.   Overall, it is a fantastic game and I recommend it to anyone who loves RTS games as it has kept me hooked for hours and I can tell you right now that that 41.9 hrs spent on this game is probably going to double within the next two weeks.

It introduces the Soviets as a new playable faction, comes with a shiny campaign, new maps, and a few new mechanics. Aside from that and the enhanced visuals it's just about the exact same game. Even the in-game interface is damn near identical.  It makes for a game that plays well and fans are certain to enjoy, but simultaneously isn't very appealing to non-hardcore fans. CoH2 does bring some improvements, like an ongoing player advancement system that unlocks statistical upgrades and aesthetic enhancements for multiplayer. Theatre of War is another great addition that adds tons of story-driven co-op vs ai, solo botmatches, and solo challenge missions.  The rest of the new mechanics are mostly fluff. Ice, snow, and cold weather are notable new game mechanics, but it never feels like they have a major impact on the way the game is played. You can blow up ice beneath units to sink them, you can track units through snow, and units can die from cold. It sounds impactful, it should be in theory, but in practice it doesn't really change the way you play the game all too much. This is further worsened by the fact that most of the campaign - and multiplayer/ToW maps - doesn't involve ice, snow, or cold weather at all.  The singleplayer campaign is simultaneously better and worse than CoH's. Its structure is similar to the original CoH, not Tales of Valor, but its missions aren't quite as obnoxiously long-winded: they're just long-winded now. There also seems to be a bit more variation in objectives and limitations during missions. Yet the game is riddled with grossly exaggerated parodies of things-that-ocassionally-happened in the Soviet army during WW2, which eventually ruin the experience even for westerners.  Company of Heroes 2's multiplayer is very much like the original CoH. It still works well. There's not much to talk about here other than said ongoing progression system that allows you to build up a custom loadout of enhancements and commanders. That makes for a bit more variation, but the enhancements are mostly minor.  Visually Company of Heroes 2 is a notable improvement over the original game, but not as much over Dawn of War 2. The benchmark seems simultaneously uglier and underperforming versus playing a regular match, but that's likely a matter of perspective. Textures are still a sore point even with everything cranked to Maximum. Most importantly, Company of Heroes 2 is easily one the more demanding games out right now and it certainly doesn't look the part.  The major DLC packs are Theatre of War campaigns. Those include botmatches / co-op vs ai / solo challenges in a campaign-like narrative structure. That's actually a substantial amount of content for the price if you like CoH's singleplayer gameplay.   Conclusion / TLDR  Company of Heroes 2 is a solid entry in the Company of Heroes series that's sure to please fans. But it's not a substantial improvement over Company of Heroes in any regard. Recommended for fans of the franchise. Anyone else might want to look twice or wait for a sale.

            "review_text": "COMPANY OF HEROES 2 is an adrenaline heart pumping strategic thinking triggering work of gaming art. The last time I saw this level of strategic depth and detail to realism was when playing table top war games like NAPOLEON AT WATERLOO. Here the computer takes the number crunching out of the players hands while delivering tons of statistical info on screen as things like weather and terrain play huge roles in the outcome of battles.  Weather such as snow can effect armies by freezing them to death and slowing them down. And having one type of snow variable effecting different things wasn't enough for RELIC they also had to add in blizzards which effect line of sight while magnifying the consequences of regular snowfall. By building fire pits or entering buildings units are able to stay warm and be protected by the demoralizing elements of nature. Snow banks can be blasted away to clear a path and make traveling easier.  I found myself getting attached to ground troops as they would survive battles and become experienced veterans only to feel my heart sink a bit as a veteran infantry tank killing unit got decimated by a almost dead King Tiger tank. Then there were those times when only one soldier was left squeezing off that final rocket which lands a lucky shot making a armor unit into a slag of burning metal.  Pretty much every unit in COMPANY OF HEREOS 2 can be upgraded with better weapons and defensive measures like smoke screens to better survive the brutal battlefield.  Graphics are stunning looking like something out of a table top miniatures war game with detail one can zoom into seeing the wood grain on rifles and the whites of the enemies eyes.  Sound effects are unequaled in their immersive power putting me in a different world consumed by unrelenting remorseless war where the only choice is to fight or die. It was a electric mind jolt of terror hearing soldiers screaming in agony as their bunker was drenched with cascading waves of flamethrower fire. Where's the Thorazine!? I think am having a flashback!  COMPANY OF HEROES 2 a nonstop battle fest of screaming metal and unbound heroism by valiant Russian men and women fighting for what they believe in. Buy it! Play it! Experience the horror and the glory that is COMPANY OF HEROES 2!!! ",

But thats all been fixed now, (took them long enough) and as a person who preordered the fancy collectors edition I got my money's worth out of it. Any one who bought it day one or preordered the regular version I can see why your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. This game had an insane amount of Day One DLC and post release DLC. And when I can get a game for 5 bucks on steam why should I pay $3 for a line of code. But I'm reviewing a game here not their policies. The game play is a lot better than the orginal CoH, no longer do you have to build clunky and massive structures that take up half your command territory, they are now small trenches/bunkers that spawn the units off map, so you no longer have to worry about building that Panzer Command too close to another building and having your lovely Panzer IV stuck inside it. Alot of people don't seem to like the new weather effects but personaly I love them. During blizzards it goes from all out war, to small hit and run ,and a bigger focus vehicle combat. And because Snipers (last time I played it) arn't effected by it they are much more useful. I'm not going to go into the campagin/story because it a load of bullisht but I can say I did have fun with it on certain missions. Now with all the commander DLC this game is basically pay to win right? Well yes and no. You don't unlock any of the good commanders til about level 10 and as far as I'm aware the DLC commanders are unlocked instanly. So low level players those begining COs are crap in my experience. But fourtionally you can Grind XP in Skrmish or private games with your friends and game the good stock COs. Where the DLC COs are balanced to about that level range. But I've only played 3 Mulitplayer matches so you didn't hear it from me. All around I think its an improvement from the Orginal. If you can ingore the DLC ,not listen to anyone who hates this game only for the Story and nothing else, and pray that relic/SEGA/Invisible Game Patch Devil, doesn't break something again and take 4 months to fix it. I can recomend this game again. For now.",

Armor now has various sides, with the sides and rear being weaker making flanking of heavy armor the tactic to go. But that is easier said then done as each unit has it's own play style, some are anti infantry some anti armor and some are a jack of all trades but you need various units supporting each other.  The graphics and sound is very well done it really gives you immersion. Also added is dynamic line of sight, it gives the game a whole new dimension by adding realism to it. The whether also makes a entry and you have cold fatigue, mud etc.  The big down side is the DLC's and there prices it is just expensive to buy them. Commanders costing several euro's to buy!? who ever came up with that should be fired. Pay to win is sneaking in through the back door here CLOSE IT FAST!!

I love the historical accuracy with all of the units and how they work, and I really like the destructible environments and epic battles.   This game has some really glaring weaknesses though that keep it from being the masterpiece that it truly could be:  1. 75% or more of the players online play as axis only, and the reason why is that the Axis are OP, mainly because of their   amazingly strong super heavy tiger and king tiger tanks. If Relic nerfed the axis, or, better yet, got rid of their OP super heavy tanks, the game would be much better. Needless to say I mostly play as Russians and the USF, and to add to balance problems, the USF still aren't as strong as they should be.   2. Horrible matchmaking. It took me 10 minutes to find a game, and when I did it was with a level 95 player... and I'm level 40. I suppose part of this is because of the relatively small player base, but still, they could use some work.  3. For DLC I love the idea of skins, but why limit it to tanks? If Relic made new infantry skins, they'd make more money. However, I'm completely against the DLC commander idea. Why? Because in many ways its pay to win. 'Oh but you can unlock them ingame'. Rare commanders tend to be the best, and I've only unlocked 1 the whole time I've played. People who spend money on the game tend to do better because of the DLC commanders.   So overall, I love the game, but I have some key issues with it that I just mentioned. This game has the potential to be a masterpiece, but some really stupid things have reduced its awesomeness. I sincerely hope that Relic fixes all the issues with the game, and with their plans for the future like adding new factions and campaigns, I look forward to what will come: PLZ PLZ PLZ add Italians and Brits!

It would of worked if you could trade the stuff but you can't (I've heard rumors of that being added though) you can buy all the commanders and stuff for around $3 or more a pop. It's an annoying inconvenience because it adds a limited pay2win feature. They added 3 new armies each having their own strengths and weaknesses but they're a bit too pricey honestly. The multiplayer experience is a fun one... depending on your team mates. There's only a 'tutorial' for the Soviet and American faction so for the Eastern front Wehrmacht, Ober Kommando West, and Commonwealth you have to learn on the job. The DLC is honestly getting out of hand. When they released the American campaign (for $40) they had another dlc pack for the Rangers Company which can only be used in that campaign, not multi player. It’s nothing like the first one which isn’t necessarily a bad thing but IMO the 1st beats the 2nd. This game had very, very, VERY limited moding too for those who like to add eye candy.",

Love them all, but I know what I'm saying when I tell you this is my fav game now.  + many units + balanced + realism (I): 1 tank reks everything unless you have Panzerschrecks, AT guns or tanks yourself + many different stratgies + AI surprises in every game + realism (2): Pioneers can repair tanks, you have to return to base to reinforce, etc. + airstrikes + mortar strikes + every unit has special abilities + still want me to go on here? + awesome with friends + large player base  - too many dlcs for the game already being almost 40 bucks (got it on sale, as usual) + who needs dlcs anyway if he can StuKa the enemy?",

It has very fun moments and satisfying kills but there is nothing like getting stomped into the ground in a battle that feels unfair. One of the hardest conecepts in this game is knowing that you dont need to counter the enemy, you need to counter the future of what he is doing.  Pros: Different Nations Varried commanders giving a playstyle you enjoy Great with friends Plenty of maps Tons of replayablity Cons: Microtransaction hell - you have to pay 2.99$-3.99$ USD for each commander you want, while they can be gotten in drops it is very rare to get one. With the new update to the drop system I am hopeful that this will be somewhat easier. However this does not ruin the game as you can work quite well with just ur basic units, and some games I forget to pick a commander until the end.  Will make you want to cry when you loose a geared squad to a single tank round or mortar shot. :c  TL;DR Good game, even better wtih friends.",

Without any mods this game sucks, hard. And up until fairly recently, it was only moddable with maps. Now we have tuning packs and such, which make the game very playable and good in my opinion. Without them, the game sucks. The ranges are horrible, 90% of all the factions units are locked behind commanders that take forever to unlock or require you to buy, the health of all units is horrible, the historical accuracy is non-existent, etc. But with tuning packs (especially Battleground: Europe, I highly recommend it, very historically accurate and fun) the game is insanely better. Workshop for maps is really great and keeps the game alive with new maps to play at the click of a button. And for really great historically accurate vehicle skins.

Story may be dry and cliche. - Great workshop adding many hours of replayability - AI is rather compitent, not human smart though. (Although beware of humans.) ------------ Cons(Sorta): - Many DLC are for what I'd consider are at slightly above acceptable price. Just wait for sales and it all seems reasonable. - The drop system. A failure to me on Relics part to be innovative. I would like it if I didn't mean I was piling up all the same bulletins, camos, and commands from say Wehrmacht and Russians. Having on some bulletins 3 versions of the same. After the survey they did about the system I felt it was ignored information. - Ardennes Assault not worth $40, refer to Con #1. -Lack of modding development. Owned the game since release and it has been a boring wait something for them to build on the modding tools. Perhaps in the future you'll see the likes of CoH1 level modding. I understand balance comes first but we're entering the games later life cycle and it needs to be future proofed. ------------ Sorry for long post, have a potato. As well as banana for scale.

            "review_text": "I used to play a lot of Warcraft 3 and Age Of Empires 3 when growing up, and have recently gotten back into competitive RTS games with COH2 being the first I've spent more then 100 hours on. I intend to keep playing right now, as I think this game has a whole lot of potential and continues to go on great sales (50%-75% off is totally worth it for the base game + Western Front Armies).   Like Relic's other games, in COH2 you build squads of soldiers and single vehicle units from your base, and fight against the opposing player on a rich, destructable map. Skirmish games are Victory-Point based, meaning you try to hold certain points to reduce your opponent's score over time; as long as you are holding 2 out of the 3 victory points, you will be causing their score to go down. When it reaches 0, you lose.  You don't gather resources, instead resources trickle in based on your current army size / population, and the sectors on the map you have captured. The main resource is manpower, which is used for purchasing every unit and upgrade, and you receive more for, the smaller your army is. The second most important resource is fuel, which allows you to build vehicles and research upgrades, and finally there is munitions, which allows your units to use their abilities, such as throwing grenades, placing mines, and getting better guns. Fuel and Munitions are received based on capturing and holding more points on the map.  PROS - Very fun multiplayer battles. COH2 is much like a game of chess, where there are hard counters, soft counters, and many elements to the battlefield. Although base-building is not a major aspect of the game by any means (and that is something I usually love in my RTS's), there is enough going on to keep a player thinking the whole time. - Blowing up buildings! Placing Mines! Artillery Barrages! Tank battles! Machine Guns and Mortar Support Teams! FLAMETHROWERS! Units are fun to use. Nearly every unit has at least one upgrade or ability, so even though you may have less than 20 units on the map, there is a lot to do with them - set up the MG in the right place, sprint your sniper to better cover, have your mortar throw down smoke bombs for a flanking assault by your shock troops, or perform a risky ramming maneuver with your T34 tank. - Randomness (known as RNG) gives an exciting element to the battle. COH2 is still figuring out the right amount of it, but it makes responding to what happens in a battle as important as making good plans. Sometimes, your AT gun misses three shots in a row, allowing your opponent's tank to blitz through your lines. Other times, you hit those three times, penetrate one, and knock the tank's engine out, leaving it dead in the water. Will he risk his engineers trying to repair it, or will you manage to clear the crew, leaving the tank abandoned, and take it for yourself? #adapt  CONS - Three main multiplayer systems could be better, in my opinion: Commander, warspoils, &amp; ELO ranking. :::::Commander system is regarded by the community to be inferior to COH1's, where you would pick a commander and then be able to spend your command points on . In COH2, you are allowed to take 3 Commanders into the game, and pick one during the game, which will give you a single 'Roster' of 5 Units and Abilities. Different Commanders for each faction are mostly different mixes of the same pool of about 12 units and abilities, some combinations of which are regarded as clearly stronger than others right now. (12/27/2014) :::::Warspoils is the reward for playing multiplayer. 1 Commander, 'Intel Bulletin' (in-game stat upgrade, i.e. +3% Rate of Fire to your machine Guns) or Vehicle skin is randomly rewarded for about every 3 hours of playing the game in multiplayer. You have no control over what you will get, duplicates are common, and there is no way to trade/craft these. It seems the developers are actively looking for feedback to improve this system, and I hope to see it changed in the future. :::::ELO Ranking for automatch is not transparent. Without third party tools, you are unaware of your rank, and you are unaware of your opponent's relative skill level. I feel this should be made more transparent. - Singleplayer story is a little lackluster, being what got this game in trouble in Europe upon launch. Much of the story focuses on war crimes committed by the Russian Red Army. If this does not bother you, the missions are varied and interesting. - Community needs to improve. Ranked Automatch with random players is a staple in modern RTS games. The intense tactical nature of this game means that you will lose some engagements in a skirmish; this is OK. Unit preservation and coordinating with your allies is very much a key element to winning, but often it is hard to work with strangers over the internet.",

And unlike cheap, polished, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPS titles like COD that turn the meaning of realism into a pure ♥♥♥♥-like facade (and come up with virtually nothing innovative whatsoever in terms of gameplay; YOU WANNA FIGHT ABOUT IT) both games in the Company of Heroes franchise are in many ways works of RTS innovative genius. I suppose I shouldn't be juxtaposing war franchises of two almost entirely different genres, but Call of Duty, for all of its overly-generic and high budget corporate we-don't-give-a-♥♥♥♥-about-what-you-think-because-we-make-money-off-of-this philosophy, is literally nothing compared to games like CoH2, where an extensive amount of time (and effort) on a comparatively smaller budget produced a game that is just impossible not to appreciate if you enjoy ultra-realistic RTS games. And I mean ultra-realistic in the sense that some of even the finest and most minute IRL factors that affect tactical maneuvering, technology gaps, terrain, cover, and even mixed-unit and combined arms doctrines, are taken into account and make an enormous difference in any battle's outcome.   The AI still tends to often be unbalanced, as it was in CoH1--it's typically either too easy to defeat or virtually impossible not to get tactically crushed by--but in CoH2 in particular a greater amount of emphasis has been placed on player-to-player cooperation and player-versus-player, rather than AI, action, and this game comes with an unprecedented ♥♥♥♥♥on of new multiplayer campaigns and game modes. Another vast improvement CoH2 has over its predecessor is a vastly less glitchy, and also even more realistic physics engine: possibly every law of physics governing the difference between two different types of tanks going head to head and trying to destroy one another is taken into account, and only games like World of Tanks go into greater detail over the physics of compartmentalized and regional damage than CoH2 does. But where WoT focuses exclusively, of course, on the physics governing its namesakes interacting in various environments, CoH2 more or less runs an entire carbon copy of the IRL universe within its own engine, leaving hardly any stones unturned, and it makes a clearly visible and tactical difference in gameplay. The literal only things I can think of that happen in the real world that don't also happen in CoH2 are vehicle motors freezing over in deep winter, and the ever-present problem that all factions frequently faced throughout the Second World War involving tank guns occasionally jamming or misfiring and HMG barrels overheating and becoming unusable.   Best part is that CoH2 is constantly being developed and having new features, units, and doctrines added to it almost on a monthly basis, derived overwhelmingly from community feedback. Games by other developers such as Valve also *sometimes* do this, but Relic really far outpaces them and most other developers in both the quality and the pace of their own involvement in improving and adding features in all areas of the game. When people experiment with new units, doctrines, maps, and other aspects of gameplay and present them to Relic, if they're good enough they pretty much always make it into the official game in some form. Contrast this with Valve, whose master plan for improving their gaming communities these days exclusively involves making their fanbases ♥♥♥♥ waterfalls of money for them in return for stupid hats.   Relic barely survived THQ's falling off the face of the earth last year, but even with what little they had left to work with in the end they managed to produce something that is really, really ♥♥♥♥ing impressive in my eyes.  TL;DR 9.8/10, this game kicks the ♥♥♥ of every FPS and nearly every RTS you have ever played, and in virtually no way falls short of what Relic intended it to be.",

The game originally came with two factions, the Soviets and the Wehrmacht. Balance was non existant for about 8 months with total domination of the Wehrmacht. Relic has stepped up their balancing since then, but man did it take forever to get where we are, and we're still not quite there yet. It's a good game though, even when the game was at its worst point, it was still incredibly fun to play - It is an extremely engaging game that requires tons of tactical and strategical thinking. Fail at one, and you lose the game.  Good: The best design for how a strategy game works (how resources are collected, how units fight etc. make for the best RTS formula ever) Decent graphics Excellent sound &amp; atmosphere Very competetive in 1v1 and 2v2, and so much more fun in 3v3 and 4v4. The new editor is excellent  Bad: Balance takes forever to be fixed if an issue pops up Campaign is beyond dull and extremely politically biased (differs quite a lot from how well the CoH1 campaigns were made) Ardennes Assault messed up the balance again. If you want to be OP, you better be ready to pay for the OKW as well.  It's not perfect, but it's still the most fun RTS I know.",

This game is for pure entertainment. The closest thing you'll find to skill is 1v1,2v2 MM. 3v3 and 4v4 are for big clunky battles that one team will only obtain victory by spaming alot of units.

            "review_text": "As a former CoH 1 veteran and fan of competitive multiplayer strategy games, I finally found the game that will fill both aforementioned roles.   When CoH 2 was out, I refused to buy it after being frustrated by the inglorious end of CoH 1. Veterans of CoH 1 will understand... abandonment, bugs, imbalance, NAT connection issues, too many exploits and lame stuff that would ruin your fun in the long run.  I grabbed it on sale 2 weeks back together with Western Front Armies and I can say 'well spent money'.  For quite some time, I have been on the look out for a modern era strategy game that has deep tactical gameplay combined with an excellent multiplayer service; the one that you can just click automatch and start playing (ranked or not) against someone of equal skill. Something that games like 'League of Legend' do very succesfully. And it gets better, as with the newly launched observer mode, you can now watch games live from other players.   As for the game itself, it exceeded my expectations. Graphics, voice overs, mechanics, the vaulting feature, the cold and much more are of superb quality. So much improvement over CoH 1 that I can sit here for hours listing every single one of them.   As for the balance I have yet to see any. From previous threads, I can see there were some issues but from what I have seen so far, most of them have been fixed. I believe you can expect to find a well balanced multiplayer experience.  -To CoH Veterans: Do not be as reluctant as me, BUY IT. It is not the pain we all remember as seen in CoH 1. It actually exceeds expectations. Hopefully, you will be as surprised (in a good way) as I am with it.  -To newcomers: I definitely recommend it. However, don't expect to find a game that plays like age of empires, starcraft etc. Remember it is a TACTICAL strategy game. A lot of stuff need to be done to achieve victory apart from training soldiers&amp;tanks and blobbing them all in a single attack. My recommendation: Watch replays and live games! preferably from top players. This is the method I used to become better at this game. Watching how other players go around the battlefield can be an invaluable lesson that will only make you better. If you cant be bothered watching it all, just use 2X, 4X + speeds. You can still learn stuff even on Fast Forward.   The only negative that I want to mention is the great number of trolls and whiners that are present within the community. Unfortunately, that is something that wasn't adressed properly from CoH 1. If you take a look in the forums, you will see people whining, screaming over balance, trolling etc etc.   I believe there will always be small or big issues with balance with games like CoH2 due to the nature of the game itself. However, crying, cursing and screaming like a spoilt 10 year old 'OMG OMG OP THIS OP THAT NERF THIS BUFF THAT ♥♥♥♥ NOOB, WTF RELIC, STFU OMG OMG', even if you have a legit point, it does not make it any better.   As with the first CoH, there were REAL issues with balance. Indeed! however, this was the excuse for people to start whining about everything. even for things that weren't broken. From my experience, most of the whining comes from L2P (Learn to play) issues. People that expect this game to be like age of empires. Sorry guys, this is NOT AoE. Learn to play well first then cry about balance. You will see that the things you call OP, UP or Broken are actually lack of experience and skill. Both Experience and Skill comes from playing and LEARNING from your mistakes.   Thats all!  9/10 Keep at the good work guys ;)    ",

            "review_text": "In many ways this game is great but unfortunately it has been poorly managed.   Balance is based on what on whats popular and whats selling. Factions sold separately from the base game are not balanced against the German Osteer and Soviet Union. The OKW faction (4$) and British faction (10$) are quite overpowered against the base game factions.   This is also the case with the various commanders/doctrines that give you access to different units and strategies. These are currently being sold at $5 each. One egregious example of an imbalanced commander/doctrine is the one that allows for the deployment of a King Tiger. This tank (best in game) only costs manpower to deploy and all of the other tanks in the game cost fuel.   The community managers and balancing teams have very little involvement the community. There is practically no interaction with them on the forums and most emails sent Relics way (about hacking, glitches, balancing) are ignored. Infamous hackers on Coh1 and Coh2 have been left unbanned for years despite mountains of complaints, videos and emails to Relic. The game previous community manager was hated by the community for being obsessed with 'triggering' content and censoring the chat to create a family fiendly game. The units in the game regularily say swears that are censored in the games chat and forum.  Overall you'll find that about half your games are very enjoyable and mostly balanced experiences.",

And abuse the living $#!$ out of it. Its firing arch is like 360 degrees. Its nearly impossible to flank it unless you bring up like 4 squads of infantry or a scout car. Meanwhile the soviet mg the maxim has only a 80 degree fireing arch and cant pin s%@. Not only that but axis players can just sit on their %$# and spam mg bunkers all over the map. And theres literally nothing you can do about it until you spend 310 manpower on a zis gun. And good luck keeping it alive long enough to take the bunkers out. Meanwhile the axis player by this time has a tank. Some upgraded LMG volks. And ostwind. That just destroyes everything. Its just so freaking OP.

That being said, the sequel does also include a fair amount of impressive new content (interactive scenery, dynamic line of sight, and increased unit abilities). Considering these issues, I would strongly advise buying this game.   The only fly in the ointment is the balancing issues. Anybody who has played COH2 would have to acknowledge that there seems to be a strong Axis bias (which is reflected in the people searching for a game as those factions; 80:20 Axis to Allied ratios are not uncommon). I freely admit that on paper, the Allies have many good units, but in my opinion their reliance on micro-management makes them far less attractive than their relatively a-move-ish Axis equivalents.  In short, there is still room for improvement such as tinkering with the balancing, and new unit abilities (sniping drivers out of light vehicles, etc) and in-game voice chat, but overall I would say that this is a game that, with the right attitude, will keep you entertained for years.  8/10",

I play as all the factions really, but in matchmaking i tend to play allies to find a match more quickly.  The Allies take more micromanaging but are more numerous and vet up quickly, the Axis are elite, but expensive. To play allies effectively requires more babysitting and therefore in my opinionmore skill.  The people complaining of a pay wall are all hung up on their opinions. In THEIR OPINION the 'best' commanders are premium (Ahem, US Forces...) but other than the brand new factions that is hardly true. i have spent about $40 dollars on this game and have most (85% or so) of the commanders, all of tthe factions, and both campaigns, and quite a few vehicle skins. i havnt bought the theater of war packs. Yes there is a bit of random sprinkled inand it isnt the absolute most realistic simulator game out there, but it is in its base form a well put together, butiful, relatively poorly optimized, game. The USSR campaign while fun and theatrical goes way off the deepend. Theater of war is fun and adds campaign-like challenges that you can complete either solo, with an ai teammate or with a friend.    All in all im not sure its still a $40 game but for &lt;$20 its a steal.",

This game is based on the Eastern front during WW2 and at the time of writing this review they have recently added the western front DLC allowing for a multi front WW2 RTS game. Although this game isn't on-par with its predecessor, it is an exciting and fun RTS game.   The campaign on this game has a decent story line and well thought out battles with tactical decisions the player must make in order to win.  The multiplayer is fun, fast and repetitive. There are hundreds of players online for most of the day making it easy to get into games. There are many different tactics that can be used e.g: Flanking, ambushes, counters, ect and as for strategy there are doctrines that contain special ability's and units to suit different players play styles. The map is mostly destructible and can change drastically during play making early, mid and finally late game different experiences all together. Team work is encouraged and coordinated attacks and defences go a long way in winning a game. There is some customizability of your army through vehicle skins and different commanders.   Overall I would rate this game a 8/10 and is definitely worth your money and time if you like RTS.  Any thoughts expressed in this review are my own personal opinion. I hope you find this useful.",

You can't just make giant blobs of units and throw them at the enemy, unless you wish to be blown up almost instantly. You need actual strategy, flanking, distraction, everything you can think of to get anywhere in this game.  ",

This is a very slick and impressive RTS, and like the original game the momentum and balance of power are white-knuckle. The weapons and equipment modelling isn't terribly inaccurate or arcadey - German infantry is superior to Soviet conscripts, but the latter come in greater numbers. Pinning a Soviet rifle section with MG42 fire is extremely satisfying. Stunning and knocking out a Bolshevik tanks with carefully concealed, ambushing PaK's is amazeballs. There is a great sense of Teutonic satisfaction in pinning enemy infantry with MG fire, hitting them with mortars, while flanking with rifle sections to annihlate them. This is not an easy game to jump into and dominate if you are not experienced with RTS games, but it is much more thoughtful than games like Starcraft.",

(Recipe for disaster and scrubbyness, I know)  I had a thing for warhammer and real world war history, and so I bought this game as part of the big relic package that included CoH1, Space Marine, and all of DoW1 and DoW2. Progression is similar to Warcraft/Starcraft and other standard RTS titles - basebuild, pile resources, microharass early game and build defenses while preparing for a big push lategame. The differences are that it supports a more aggressive style since (like in Dawn of War) you need to expand and claim territory to increase resource flow, and that there is MUCH less researching improvements with teching being integrated into basebuilding (you build infantry tent to unlock infantry tent#2 which unlocks the tank factory)   Personally I like this system better, because it adds more ways to progress beyond 'esports sequence or bust' (as seen in competitive Starcraft). The results are below.  You NEED combined arms and micro to be successful past the very early game. Throwing out a tidal wave of T-34's and conscripts mindlessly will get you lots of bodies and wrecks with little result and a massive resource drain, if the enemy is halfway competent. (Which is how I came to the conclusion stated in the disclaimer) But once you have that, you can pull your weight, and perhaps even carry scrubs like me to victory.   You NEED to be a fast clicker. Speed is everything. If the enemy sends tanks before you have AT defenses, you're done. If you get your guys into key positions and manage to send them support before the enemy starts trying to dislodge them, they'll never leave. And there is no 'esports sequence' because every progression style has a drawback and counter (fast expansion = lots of territory to keep track of, and so on and so forth)   T-34/10 am still trying to learn it (and I HAVE NO OPINION ON GAME BALANCE because it's a can of worms I don't want to think about) but I believe Relic made an amazing new style of RTS.",

I remember pre-ordering this game like 7 months before it was was out and was incredibly disappointed when I played it and left it out for a few months. I came back to it later and really enjoyed the game because of changes. But the question you may be asking is what is it like now?  Well, now after a year and a half of changes and updates, this game is simply amazing and is one of the best RTS games around today, if you are willing to spend a lot of money that is, for the DLCs. Here's some good and bad points to sum it up:  Good: .Lots of faction variety and all are interesting with different playstyles given. .Good balance at the minute. It's not perfect, but is damn good. .Plenty of unit variety. Every unit has its use in my opinion. .The doctrine system. People may not agree on this, but there is near 20 doctrines on two factions from the vanilla game and 6 at the minute for the western front armies. Compare that to the COH1 doctrines which had 3 doctrines per team eith 2 paths to toake. .Snow graphics. The winter atmosphere and detail are unmatched in any RTS game. Even though the winter maps may not be very fun. .The game is still alive with updates and has a couple of years plan so the devs not done yet! Lots of more stuff is to come. .Most of the community. The game has a good community up at  COH2,org  always discussing balance and replays.  The bad: .Winter maps with blizzards slow down the gameplay and are unnessaccary in my opinion. Just the blizzards and cold though. .Some of the community. There are always those people that moan and complain about things or generally take the game far too seriously that leaves you having no fun and possibly annoyed. .DLC. I wouldn't blame anyone if the DLC put anyone off buying this game. There's alot to catch up on. DLC includes commanders, vehicle skins, faceplates, Digital collectors edition and the Newest but recommended DLC, the western front armies. Performance problems. This game is not even the best looking and requires a MONSTER PC to play on the highest graphics. These are not fixed and probably will never be.  My verdict: 8.5/10  You will have a ton of fun, but prepare your wallet.",

            "review_text": "It's a shame that this game only gets 'Mostly Positive' and even recently 'Mixed' reviews.  I played a fair bit of the original Company of Heroes, and moved over to the second during the early beta. At the time it felt like an incredibly different game, and part of me rejected it outright. However, since playing it for longer I really feel like nothing drastic has changed and the output has been a very fun and engaging RTS.   The gameplay itself is excellent. Unlike some other RTS games like C&amp;C the gameplay is focused much more on micro-play; the way you position your units can win or lose you a game. That's fine, because that's what the majority of the game is focused on. You could have the greatest timings for building up your economy and 'teching' up; but if you leave your big ♥♥♥ tank with its ♥♥♥♥ hanging out then a couple of AT guns, which aren't all that expensive and quickly available, will leave you wish a massive hole in your army. Cover differentiates between negative, none, medium and heavy. The better the cover, the less damage your unit takes. This made everything feel a little bit more focused on the engagements you had, which were happening almost constantly across the map. Despite this, the game's pace feels very relaxed in comparison to other RTS games like Starcraft. You will feel overwhelmed at first but once you get a build order sorted (many are available online) you can forget about the whole macro strategy and focus more on getting your micromanagement up to speed.   There's a good variety of maps, each of which have their own unique personalities and promote, to a minimal degree, a different approach of play. Some buildings are very open field whereas others are heavily laden with buildings you can jump in and out of. So in an open field map you may want to consider how you're going to advance on the enemy; smoke grenades, mortar fire, artillery, a tank line? You have to think on your feet a lot; so when things go well you are very satisfied.   There is a learning curve, you need to have a quick google and glance at places like  coh2.org  or other wikis that explain the different capabilities of units. This is all part of learning a competitive game, and if you like the WW2 theme and the looks of the gameplay then it's well worth the invested time.   A lot of the negative reviews stem from issues of 'balance'. I think these are entirely nonsense. The balance in Company of Heroes 2 is entirely reasonable with no clear steam-rolling from any one faction. Once the British were released people ♥♥♥♥ themselves into thinking they were overpowered because they had no idea how to play. Shortly after, however, players figured out that the Wehrmacht faction's lone sniper unit (an early available unit) could almost negate the British player early on. Everything since has been patched. There will be strategies you find hard to deal with, or some that seem overpowered. However, that is entirely due to the fact that commanders can be used in ways others haven't thought of (even the devs, they're only human) and so rely on the community reporting these worries.   To give an example: Last night I was thrown a curve ball in a 2v2 match where the enemy built nothing but engineers. They attempted to quickly capture the map against the slow-moving British units and rushed for light tanks and vehicles which the British take a little longer to get going. Honestly, I know a lot of players who would have said '♥♥♥♥ it! These Germans are so OP!'. But after capturing their territory that connects the others together (and so denies them resources) we quickly caught back up and gave them a run for their money. It was a fairly normal game (around 30 minutes) because as shocking and powerful their strategy appeared they usually have a hole to exploit which was their lack of focus on anti-tank by trying to get the early-game victory.   Don't let the balance/RNG posts fool you! Relic fairly frequently come off feedback from the community and alter balance; something it works, sometimes not - it was no different in CoH1 as notalgic reviewers like to claim. The game is fantastic and a gem. It's a shame that people protested enough to get rid of some exciting features. There used to be a blizzard mechanic that caused the maps to become bitter cold and lack visibility. Getting units to heat was a must, it slowed down the game pace but I felt it offered a unique style of play where you were rewarded for managing to be mobile during this period or using your time wisely to recoup. You could always veto these maps anyway!   All in all. Good game, give it a whirl, ignore bitter players.     ",

Many people try this game and get stomped by great players and get frustrated and give up and give the game a bad review when they haven't even given it a fair chance. My advice is to play against the easy computer and give yourself computer allies and get a feel for the game mechanics then study up on the stratedgy guides that you can find on youtube on imperial danes propagandacast. Realize your going to loose... A lot in the beginning but its worth it to stick with it and master the game.

I've won and lost like normal versus these commanders without the payed commanders and i bought the extra commanders later (after 1 month i guess because i wanted the kv 2 and heavy howitzer --&gt; bigger is more awesome) and still im not winning every game.

This game is DLC heavy so if you plan on playing online you will be at an extreme disatvantage without the DLC's!

WWII setting is interesting, but this is not the only game that has it. (Think of Men of War: Assault Squad) Resource collection is passive, meaning that there are no collection units, you just take territory and resources are given to you based on what area you took. Wide variety of units which all serve different purposes to differing degrees of success. Plenty of maps, both community-made and developer-made, which adds to replayability. Many of the commanders are bit mundane, especially the ones which are given to you for free. Some of the best units in the game, (Tiger Ace, Sturmtiger, etc...) are only available to commanders which need to be purchased, so there is a bit of a discrepancy between players who haven't purchased any commanders, and those who have. Additionally, commanders in the store are a little pricy for my taste, ranging from $2 to $4, but they do add a bit of flavor to any player's loadout. Matchmaking is good, but the low amount of players means that you may very well be matched with players from other continents. (I live in the United States and I often see players from Europe and Asia) Overall, a really good game to buy with some friends if it's on sale, or if you're itching for some historical RTS action.",

Remove from the heat and sprinkle in the yeast and 1/4 teaspoon sugar (don't stir). Set aside until foamy, 5 minutes. Whisk in the melted butter, egg yolk and vanilla.  Whisk the flour, the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, the salt and nutmeg in the bowl of a stand mixer. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Mix on low speed with the dough hook until thick and slightly sticky. Knead on medium speed until the dough gathers around the hook, 6 minutes. (Add up to 2 more tablespoons flour if necessary.)  Remove the dough and shape into a ball. Butter the mixer bowl and return the dough to the bowl, turning to coat with butter. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 1 hour 15 minutes.  Roll out the dough, fill and cut into buns (see instructions below). Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan; place the buns cut-side down in the pan, leaving space between each. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 325.  Bake the buns until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cool in the pan 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Sift the confectioners' sugar into a bowl, then whisk in the cream and melted butter. Transfer the buns to a rack and spoon the glaze on top while still warm.  How to Form Cinnamon Buns  1. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 12-by-14-inch rectangle with the longer side facing you.  2. Spread with the softened butter, leaving a 1/2-inch border on the far long edge. Mix the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the butter.  3. Brush the unbuttered far edge with water. Roll the dough away from you into a tight cylinder and press on the long edge to seal.  4. Cut the cylinder with a sharp knife to make 6 equal-size buns.",

The beauty of the raw and brutal animations in the gameplay itself is enough to let me recommend this.

One of the problems is that such an advanced tactical RTS demands a lot from the player in terms of speed, perception and decision making. Because of this, the idiots that are left at Relic will never be able to balance anything within reasonable bounds, nor will the AI ever be an authentic challenge.   I do not mind DLCs, I really don't. They are just following a crummy trend and taking it to the next level of idiocracy. What annoys me however is that they do not care about the game or the gamer, only the money. DLCs are fine if you are actually going to work with the game and improve it, but these guys just keep adding new shiney stuff that makes the problem of balance an ever increasingly more impossible task. By doing that they are simply smearing excrement in our faces, making the very thing I love about the franchise the root of the evil. They are exploiting my love for toysoldiers by dumping unbalanced excrement down my throat, and I am taking it in huge chunky gobbles...",

I also believe the weather needs to be more random, strength, duration, time to impact, etc. not just a set intesnity.   Matchmaking needs to go or at least have a 'server based list' option avaibale. to make custom online games with people of correct latency. dropouts and relic crashes happen far too much, and is the main reason i get annoyed witht he game.  gRaphically speaking, the game is almost no different to coh1, nothing drastic anyways, and in my opinion should not run like a pig on some of the systems i have seen it run on. It should be better optimised, hopefully relic will get on to this.   But having said all that, my Pc runs the game on max with no issues, and i play alot of it, and enjoy playing it with friends and if you mange to have a full player vs player game with no lag and dropouts, the game is great fun, espically 4v4's.

It is just a perfect game for any ww2 buff although there are very few historicly innaccurate details like burning buildings with civilians inside or a slaughter of a soldier for saving Lev Avbrimovich Isacivich. But that is simply for script drama. But the gameplay is full of enjoyment for the player. With the new Ardennes Assault and Western Front Armies DLCs which are sort of overpriced but are worth it they make some parts of the games like its previous title. Also there is lots of player customizing for the Soviets, Werchmact, OKW, and US forces. All and all it is a very good game and it is worth the buy.",

            "review_text": "So, I would like to be clear, this is a hesitant recommendation. The base game is good. Good enough to be worth buying, even. However, since the release of the game, there's been a trend that I've found entirely unpleasant and unsettling. I'll get to that after my base review.  The game is great. It's not exactly Company of Heroes 1, and the time between releases shows, but for the most part, the improvements are positive ones. I absolutely love the addition of TrueSight, as it makes the feel of the game much more realistic and provides a much greater opportunity for basic tactical gameplay. The first time someone slips a Panzer IV around you without you noticing and starts harrassing one of your flanks, you will feel it's impact.  The campaign is a little lackluster, but still good. I didn't find myself quite as drawn into it as I was with the original game, and around halfway through I sort of lost interest. Those of you who are considering buying the game for that merit alone might want to consider waiting for a steam sale or something.  Multiplayer is improved, with a much more streamlined way of finding exactly what kind of match you want. I haven't messed around with it too much, but it seems reasonably effective at matching players of equal skill level, which is always nice.  All in all, I would recommend the game, as it is.  Now, that being said, the other issue. DLC. I don't know who exactly came up with this scheme, but gone is the 'expansion pack' DLC that I loved from the first game. This game is RIDDLED with microtransactions, dozens of paint jobs for vehicles, which could be excusable, but also a huge selection of Commanders, this iterations version of skill trees from the previous game. They pump advertising for this microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t into the main menu, and it stays with you no matter what screen you're looking at. I really, really hope this idea dies in it's cradle like the abomination that it is. And, had I known this was going to be the case, it would have been enough for me to forgoe purchasing the game alltogether. It's that bad.  It's the equivalent of finding that girl you had a crush on in high school, 10 years later on the side of the road, turning tricks for a quick 20 bucks. It's just sad and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.",

This changes your approach every game so it takes a while to start feeling this RTS repetition syndrome where you get bored of playing a new 20-60min game over and over again. There are two major things I could point out on the bad side. First thing is that 'Doctrines' are limited at the begining. Even after playing for a while you beging to think it's a bit limited. Then, you see there are lot's of DLC where you get new ones. They released TONS of them and still are releasing new ones. Sometimes it kind of sucks to have to buy new ones but if you want to keep up against other players online you will have to at some point. As for my second point, I personally think that heavy tanks are a bit of a pain to get rid of with some nations/doctrines. In fact, if you let your opponent get started on a tank spam, it's probably impossible to stop them. Anything giving an edge to the opponent, gets them snowballing so hard that getting back on track is almost never possible exept if they make a big mistake over the course of their destructive push.  Overall, this game is very entertaining and gives RTS types of game a bit of hope. The lifetime of this game is really interestingly long if you take the time to learn every gamestyles. The campaign is fun and takes a good amount of time to finish even as a RTS experienced player.",

OKB West vs USA. German got their Infrared STG;s , airborne can get stuck on the trees (drop point could scatter all the way loose) , Konigstiger and the Jagdtiger 128mm.   I'm still dissappoint in the consistency of the series. they could focus this series in the East instead of returning the favor to the west (back to US and Brits). COH 2 should've able to bring players the horror of the Eastern warfare (savage fighting with the Red Army). DLC and Expansion packs could add the story of Axis satelite states as they forced to fight. As Successfull as opposing front and Tales of Valor in descripting the value and valor of soldier ideals to fight (Defending the Fatherland, Fighting for Freedom). COH 2 Should able bring the chivalry of fighting of the Eastern soldiers. But It  all vanished with the arrival of the old COH1 in COH 2 style engine and graphics.  But still, The west campaign is great (although you need to pay), voice acting as great as usual (try to spam click every unit), great soundtrack, and other aspect of classic COH you ever felt.  Overall, its still a good game. But quite lack the quality of story.",

And then there's multiplayer. First of all, the community is horrible. If you are a novice, you will be kicked out of half of the lobbies just because you're 'noob'. It's fascinating that in Wargame, for example, which is a very serious and challenging strategy, there's no such attitude towards new players. And last but not least, why do people choose mixed teams with germans and americans on one side, for example? I just can't take it. This all makes matchmaking very tedious, but once you get through that, the gameplay itself is a polished, renewed experience from the first CoH, which is great. For 8 euros it is a good deal, but I am really surprised with how much worse were they able to make the game by stupid things I mentioned above.",

Graphics are very good and the AI has been vastly improved.

ZERO balance, people on forums cry a lot, that they cannot win easy plaing as Germany, which translates to continuous nerfs for the Allies, making situations, that when You search for game its 85% Axis and 15% alies looking for game...  3. Germans can produce Panzer 4 or Panther Panzer, OKW can field King Tiger, while the best tank that you can produce when playing the Russians is T34-76 whitch is extremely weak, It cannot always penetrate REAR Panther armor from 10 meters away. Want to units that can fight with Panther? BUY commander who has better tanks.   And still, even with those HUGE flaws and Relic/Saga greednes, is a FANTASTIC RTS game, my favorite WW2 game on steam.

            "review_text": "Company of Heroes 2 is a real-time strategy game for people who don't like RTS games. And I don't mean that in a dismissive or condescending way.   COH2 does away with resource-collecting. Borrowing from Relic's own Dawn of War series of games, in COH2, resources are automatically allocated over time based on the number of strategic points each team controls. Want to build tanks? You better keep an eye on that fuel cache, lest it falls into enemy hands!  Gone also are most base management options: instead, the factions have various 'battle phases' which can be built in any order and require a certain amount of resources to unlock. When said 'battle phases' are completed, they unlock additional units like artillery, mechanized infantry and tanks.  The result is a constant fight for strategic points and to push back into enemy territories. Building a large army is not as important as micromanaging units (is my infantry behind cover? are they exposed to mortar fire? can the enemy sneak up behind my back?) and adapting to the ever-changing landscape of war. A swarm of StuG III medium tanks is deadly indeed, but it can be obliterated in an instant by a handful of strategically-placed anti-tank guns, or a carefully aimed artillery strike. And no matter how strong the Oberkommando's Sturmpioneer infantry can be in close quarters combat situations, they are no match for a machine gun nest or light vehicle fire, making them a potentially costly gamble when used against a skilled opponent.  Every faction has different units, commanders and build orders, so everyone can find a faction that suits their play style. Americans have highly-trained and well-equipped infantry, and can parachute behind enemy lines. The Soviets lack training and equipment, but they make up for it with unrivaled amounts of manpower and fairly cheap tanks. The British excel behind cover, and they build strong defensive emplacements such as mortars pits and anti-aircraft guns to fend off the enemy. The German Wehrmacht is a well-balanced army of skilled infantry and strong vehicles. And finally, the Oberkommando have access to less resources than the other factions but they are nomads on the battlefield, relying on stronger and more versatile vehicles that are more costly but simply unmatched in terms of strength.  Best of all, the tide of battle can turn in an instant even very late in the game if you build up your troops wisely and use the element of surprise to your advantage. An overconfident enemy can lose the battle mere seconds away from victory if you start mass producing heavy tanks, or you disrupt his supply lines, or you call in air support on the frontline, or you make one last desperate push towards the control points.  In other words, Company of Heroes 2 is a real-time strategy game that feels like an action game with a top-down view. It's not Age of Empires with a World War II skin on top of it. This isn't StarCraft either: it's not a game for pianists who can press 300 keys per minutes. It's a game of cooperation, military strategy and wit.",

Nothing else in the RTS genre could hold a candle to this, and I would bet very few companies are even willing to try. The meticulous attention to detail in this game is outstanding. However, like all games it does have some annoying quirks. Like tank AI being completely ridiculous (Anyone who's seen their tanks turning to avoid a stone fence will know what I am talking about.) Although, these are very minor gripes.   It's a tad bit steep on the learning curve, but once you begin to git gud you'll learn how to reduce a tiger tank to scrap in no time. I definitely recommend, but for the love of god wait for Master Collection to go on sale. It's a game from 2013 and the price oughtta reflect that.",

            "review_text": "The Western Front Armies.  It's been eight years since the original Company of Heroes, an epic way that we portray cruelty and heroism, which took place on the Western Front during World War II. Upon issuance of Company of Heroes 2 last year, we look for updates on the eastern front, which was still krvavajší as the West. But now again we return to the Western Front with the new addition to the game Company of Heroes 2, namely Western Front Armies. As the developers managed to get a return is indeed All Quiet on the Western Front?  Along with the release of the game came out circa 4 gigabytes patch that game adapted to the new factions from the Western Front. The game has therefore modified the reward system statistics. Thus, the already neodomykajú new enhancements unit, respectively. their visual modifications as masking or new commanders through leveling the player's account, but randomly after playing the game, either against a computer controlled opponent or another player (as was, for example, in the annulled Company of Heroes Online). At the same time, these improvements were divided into several categories according to their rarity from normal, through rare (blue) and it can be assumed that it will grow even further, a color which is known for example from RPGs. All previous unlock and enhancements that were achievable by attracting new levels of account statistics are for all those who owned the original Company of Heroes 2 made available.  Along with these changes also added further modifications of the basic look of the menu, which is completely rewritten collection system command trees and their abilities, respectively. visual modifications. You need to point to finish the current state, which is less clear, as in the original version COH2 and gives the impression of a temporary solution.  Let's not describe the actual game, respectively. two (old) new factions to join the fighting in the Western Front. This is notably the American United States Army and the German Oberkommando West. These two factions operate on different principles than the army Wehrmacht and the Red Army from the Eastern Front.  Let's get started Americans. Their base unlike other factions is completely constructed by the player and not have to worry about building new structures only when directly on the frontline, ie bunkers and trenches. US Army is therefore perfect for quick, expansive players who like the so-called 'rush' tactics. Americans have a system advancement in the technology tree, which are borrowed from the British allies of the addition to the original Opposing Fronts Company of Heroes. That is, while the game from the beginning have built all the buildings for the production, respectively. calling a necessary unit, but not all are immediately accessible. For the continuation of imaginary tech tree is therefore necessary to call on the battlefield command teams that consist of chains of command of Lieutenant, later Captain and finally major. These cooperatives unlike the commanders of the British incarnation of this system is effective combat units and managed the fighting in the front line. Among the American war machine are legendary and known as machine M4 Sherman or less known M20 Utility Car, or M36 Jackson.  As for the new German version of the Western Front, thus Oberkommando West, which will also assume anything from the British from the original COH and it is specifically a system of building construction. The building and are thus, as with the pattern of their big truck, which can be spread over one of the sectors on the map. However, unlike those from the British sector can not provide, respectively. prevent his cast. At the same time nor may these jimmies after their re-distribution to pack and move to another point as in Opposing Fronts. The only way to have exploded the building in question is removed undermine and blow it into the air, which of course can have dire consequences for units located in its vicinity. This option Germans is difficult to play than the Wehrmacht, which appeared on the eastern front, or even the original of COH. The playing style is more like the German Army Panzer Elite, which also appeared in Opposing Fronts addition to the original game COH. Oberkommando West has a powerful fight monsters as Tiger II, thus Königstiger, or even the more powerful variant Jagdtiger. But it is in the arsenal of unconventional units as well as half-track vehicle with a reflector, which can detect the unit via the so-called. Fog of War (area where the map is not visible movement of enemy units), or perhaps even rocket Walking Stuka alternative half-track vehicle Sd.Kfz. 251st  Graphically, the game does not shift significantly from the basic issue Company of Heroes 2. It must however be noted that in RTS games are currently on the market, what is the visual side, effects, and overall impression of the actual battlefield tip and is ranked among the best achievements in terms of graphics. No need to progress further, because now the game looks stunning.  Audio site is also at a high level with the authentic sounds of weapons and vehicles. Also, the soundtrack is heroic and two new armies were born with music that superbly complements the right war atmosphere.  It is certainly necessary to mention the artificial intelligence computer in skirmish battles, which is paradoxically weaker than in the basic COH2. When playing against the CPU opponent mean a player is often felt as if he played against experts. Now, however, AI (Artificial Intelligence) more optimized and really difficult opponents to the above-mentioned Expert CPU. This optimization does not hurt and many newcomers to help you get into the game earlier because of frustration over 'Defeat' screen should appear much later.  The only really large negative and complaint remains non-inclusion of a new campaign, respectively. Campaign for the two new factions. At one time it was customary that when the game was released expansion pack, is bringing with it all related, as well as new units of the army, but of course the single player campaign. There was not any different at longer times the said role model, thus adding to the original Company of Heroes, Opposing Fronts. The game then brought two new campaigns with full story in the British and German troops for Kampfgruppe that personified mish xmas divisions and battle groups that fought on the Western Front against the Allies and took the name of multiplayer Panzer Elite. Unfortunately, this period has passed and we are in 2014, when the trend to offer full price product which several years ago was certainly not complete.  Through its negatives that are non-inclusion campaign, respectively. confusing system adjustments and settings commanders in battles is Company of Heroes 2: The Western Front Armies really hilarious return to the Western Front and displays fresh, though not entirely new view of the two armies that met there. It remains to hope that the developers from Relic Entertainment us serves up this addition also view the fighting in North Africa, respectively. in the far Pacific. So if you have fans of World War II and you like strategy, why not continue to delay and vhupnite directly in the fighting on the Western Front, as the game is self executable and does not require a fundamental Company of Heroes 2!",

The game play is pretty good with intensive battles around every corner and to start with infantry: they are important to assist your amour storming enemy positions because amour will never win without infantry support and the majority of foot units can look after themselves provided they have heavy weapons. If you don't have eyes on the enemy you can always use conscripts or snipers to light up the enemy targets for artillery units.(conscripts are cheap to use and they aren't experienced in combat and so trying to keep them alive is pointless). When ordering units to move to a another location your troops will follow the path you chose for them but sometimes they get stuck in rubble or go the shortest way and that mostly means straight in to enemy fire and could cost you time and resources.  As you progress though the game the main character tells his Commander just how shocked he was seeing the strategy of throwing thousands of brave men in to machine gun fire and shooting deserters to set an example to the men, on one mission you command a female sniper and her comrades behind enemy lines to rescue an informant and in return the Soviets will provide arms to the uprising that is ongoing in Warsaw and at the end of the mission your commander shoots the partisans in the back because Stalin wanted Poland under Soviet control after the war and so the Polish government in London could't return to make Poland a democracy.  The ending of the game was to be frank surprising when the a guy came into the room in which Lev was being questioned by his C.O. told him that he was found guilty of deserting and to be shot, but as the guy was about to shoot him his commander shot the guy and told him ''you better get going comrade'' and thus Lev escapes the prison camp and the commander does one last duty(shoots him self)  On the hull a great game !",

            "review_text": "To be honest, as a legacy player, I feel cheated by the devs and their MP DLC system, which primarily focuses on introducing new players (we legacy players paid $60 for the game, the new guys can play for $10), but since recommending is for new players anyway, I'll vote to recommend this game.  Let's see. First things first, despite everything, I really like this game. It's a nice mix of realism and gameplay value, creating something that's not overly complicated, but does add some basic immersion to the game. Does it have a greedy money-driven system? Of course. Game devs need money. Is it the most realistic RTS on the market? No, but its a fun and functional product (as long as your internet and PC are up to standards).  For the nitty-gritty people who want to know more than just the basics, let's look at the specific pros and cons:  +A great, ever-changing multiplayer experience - not a very repetitive game +Good mechanics that allow for a basic sense of immersion without comprimising overall 'fun value' +It is possible to hold your ground without buying any of the infamous DLC commanders +Through the drop system it is also possible to access the DLC commanders with just playtime +Unique standalone MP expansions that allow full features for a fraction of the price +Ardennes Assault (although pricey) is a great SP campaign +Great voice acting and good-looking graphics +Developers keep game up-to-date +A growing modding community that keeps getting better and better +Steam Workshop content is showcased for competitive ladder-climbing every now and then  -Modding community has limited access to assets. It's impressive how much they've made with so little. -Skewed matchmaking: when searching for a MP match, Allies consist of 30% or less, and Axis 70% or more -Armored warfare mechanics are highly arcadish and unrealistic that occasionally ruin immersion -Vehicle pathing issues that have not been fully resolved despite the game being out for about 2 years -Balance issues still haven't been worked out completely either. The balance team is juggling patches (kudos to them) but some rather mindless 'blobbing/spamming' tactics have yet to be fully addressed (looking at you, P. Gren spam). -Obvious anti-Soviet sentiment in the base SP campaign. Focuses around the atrocities of the Red Army instead of its heroism. Not saying the Red Army is made of angels, but the showcased Soviet brutality in the campaign were isolated events that happened very rarely. The devs had some nerve naming the Soviets 'protagonists' in the campaign.  +/-Some rather mind-blowing RNG that (unfortunately) is to be expected of any game where realism plays any role +/-Unrealistic weapon statistics in exchange for some semblance of balance (that as I said before, isn't quite balanced as it should be). Not a big deal for most people, but for a WWII buff like me it really bothers me that the weapons don't accurately reflect and represent their real-life counterparts. Can be fixed by modding. +/-DLC system tends to disenhearten legacy or veteran players that bought the game at release, but, if you are looking to get into CoH2, congrats. This is a plus for you then. +/-Not nearly as realistic or mechanic-heavy as Men of War: Assault Squad II, which is a $30 RTS with 5 nations rather than 4, but MP is actually fully functional and therefore infintely more stable. Pick your poison.  Is it best-in-class? Not exactly. But a game doesn't have to be better than all of its competition to be considered good. I like the game, I look forward to the new British Faction (but my wallet doesn't...) and I hope the devs someday will release more powerful modding tools. Would I recommend this game to a new player? The MP standalone armies: yes, the base $40 game: no (unless you really /really/ REALLY want to play as Ostheer or Soviets). For $10-$15, you can't get a better RTS multiplayer experience.  And that's my 100% completely honest review of this game.  PS: Do not try automatched ladder play when traveling abroad. They don't seem to have region-specific servers, and this could lead to unsatisfactory win-loss ratios coupled with a lot of rage. I learned the hard way: I dropped from rank 6,000ish (top 33%) to rank 15,000ish (bottom 33%) on the 1v1 Soviet ladder in a matter of days by playing the game in China rather than the US due to extreme lag or disconnects.",

Graphics are good, gameplay is the best I've been able to find on an RTS so far.  Multiplayer: Great. Not perfectly balanced but fun. If you are serious about the multiplayer you might end up spending a little more than the initial pricetag buying a few extra commanders.  Soviet Campaign: About half of the missions are good and the other half just sucks.  Ardennes Campaign: The campaign and missions were good actually, I just felt the metamap and the randomized missions detracted from the campaign instead of adding to it, but the missions themselves were pretty much CoH1 quality.

This was the single GREATEST feature of CoH. I was really hoping that the Germans would restore their old doctrines (possibly with the defense doctrine improved as it sucked a*s). Russians would get doctrines focusing on mass attack, inferior armor in massive numbers, or a propaganda doctrine that increased resources and passively grants Russians more power in friendly territory. I really hope they reintroduce doctrines in the third game.  -Resource caps. Another detriment to the game. Back in the first CoH, resources would accumulate... well, forever, really. It would allow for epic infantry assaults (one American Rifleman squad costs 270 manpower in that game, so having 2000 manpower was truly great), or slow accumulation of more upgrades for your army (to purchase flamethrowers, it cost 50 ammo, or 75 for a Grenadier's Panzershrek). The limits are set to 1,500 for manpower, 500 for munitions, and I THINK 250 for fuel. I also hope they remove this from the third game.  -Overly complicated UI. The first CoH was SO simple and very easy to get into. When I began to play this game, it confused me at first. Everything became smaller... and not so easy to understand. Devs may have put too many things on the screen, and I hope they resimplify the UI like it was back in CoH.  -TOO. MUCH. FREAKING. DLCs. Enough said. Pretty much it.

It's not a very hard game to play, just have to take a little consideration into what you're doing. Make sure the crews are pointed the right way, make sure to use reverse command so you tank doesn't show it's rear to a pak 40 etc. While it's not hard to play, it's pretty open ended in how well you can master it. You can make your builds as simple or as complicated as you want. The right unit, in the right place, at the right time can make a huge difference. I've won games I thought I was going to lose by a well placed field gun or commander strike. I can't say much about the campaign, I got 4 missions in before I thought it was cheesy listening to your 'character' whine about everything the soviet command decides to do.

            "review_text": "Let's just get one thing clear up front. No. It is not as good as the original Company of Heroes.  Why?  It's the little things. To put it simply, where COH1 felt like an RTS equivalent of a classic war movie, COH2 feels gamey, seeming to cater exclusively to multiplayer. I've watched submachinegunners firing entire clips at point blank range into artillery crews who just stand there, not dying for what feels like an eternity. Where in COH1 you could build sandbag walls and tank traps and barbed wire that seemed to fit seemlessly into their surroundings, player structures in COH2 stand out like a sore thumb. Sure it's a little more streamlined to have a fixed structure you place that serves its purpose, but it just doesn't feel as immersive as something that looks like something you'd actually see on the battlefield. I could go on about how increadibly long it takes to kill a tank while other units can be wiped out by one mortar round but I'll stop myself.  The campaign is reasonably fun but feels overly political. I mean, I'm pretty anti-communist myself but a lot of the attrocities depicted in the campaign are just depicted in a way that makes the bad communist commissar look more like a cartoon villain than a genuinely evil person. It's all just so ridiculous that it's hard to actually care when something awful happens.   COH2 isn't, for all this, a bad game by any means. It's still my favorite basic model for an RTS and in many ways it does improve on COH1. The graphics are better. The sound is better, particularly when your camera is far from the action and the sounds of your units fighting on different parts of the map mesh together to create an ambient battlefield sound that is immesely fun to listen to. COH2 also features a fun mission mode which can be a nice break from the simple, straightforward skirmish.   In the end this game just barely warrents a 3/5 from me. It's a definite step down from COH1 for the franchise but it's still a solid game that, were it not for the legacy of its predecessor would be truly amazing.  RECOMENDATION: Wait for a 66%-75% off sale.",

For starters, there's only one single player campaign, as Russia. No German campaign. How cheap is that?!  For seconds, the game is a rampant money grab, everything is for sale, uniforms, badges for the main menu, hell, you can buy a silver or bronze border for a dollar. And of course, there's two more factions you can buy for multiplayer (only), and there's the add on packs that add an odd mix of single player, multiplayer and co-op. Just to give you a clue, the total expenditure (not including the game itself) on packs could be up to $212?! I think it's easily possible to spend over $300 on this. Whatever you do, don't do it...  And perhaps most importantly, the core gameplay seems like more of the same, but...somehow less (probably due to the lack of Americans and German factions). Due to the ham fisted story, the game wants you to throw men forward to slaughter, just to prove how brutal to their own soldiers the Russians were in WW2.  Somehow COH has lost it's soul, and lost it's way. I wonder if the publisher Sega had anything to do with that? Most likely...  UPDATE: So, after a lot of playing I think my final anlysis is this: The game is still a big money grab, content that should be free has to be paid for. The single player campaign is still not as good as COH1, but at least there is now also the US campaign (if you pay for it). Still no German or UK campaigns. The multiplayer is better than the original, only in the sense that in the original I lost every time, but COH2 seems more balanced (despite imbalances), and at least I can win sometimes now! :) Overall, I have changed it to a thumbs up, because the positives outweigh the negatives, but I still think the DLC format sucks, and that a campaign for UK &amp; GY would have been good.",

But CoH2 does a pretty good job at telling a story I'd expect to see in a blockbuster film. It is accurate in that the Soviets were hard ♥♥♥♥♥, but it doesn't quite tell the whole story. I mean, if the Germans were knocking down your door and you just soiled yourself, wouldn't you throw tons of people into a fire? Just me? Hmm...  Skirmish wise, I've spent hours building a little army to send across the map and demolish the computer's fortifications. Nothing like sweet sweet domination.

Now though I am sad you guys dont allow us to stack boosts anymore, I can understand for commanders but I miss it for bullitions. Anyways nice so far since I got new computer this game runs very nicely though I havnt tried 4v4. So far I give COH2 a 8-9/10 but not perfect cause it still could be fixed.  1st idea: Don't allow germans to get cheaper better tanks faster then Americans, like germans can spam tanks easy while americans cant even get close to that, though american tank do have more special abilitys. 2nd: More unqiue commanders, most of the russian commanders kinda alike just a new twick or special unit which is cool but not sure if you should give them such high supply rate cost. You should almost have a Money to Supply ratio that governs cost of commmanders etc. 3rd: weekly free commander: Like I know you guys already kinda have this where you have some spec hero free (or atlest used to) but what I mean is that a player can choose one commander they dont own and for that week they can play that commander but then so that people dont just choose the same commander every week make it so a week or so cooldown on the commander they choose. Or something like that so before we buy we know what we would like.  In other words, so far a good game from last review still could improve, but thank you guys for trying.  ",

Company of Heroes (all games) are undoubtedly, a selection of the best and most realistic RTS games ever made. Great detail, realism and a must play for RTS lovers. This game tests your management skills since the resources are very limited. The game has a great multiplayer with teamwork being of utmost importance. It gives a very realistic feel of World War-2 and the units used by the militaries of Germany as well as Allies. You take command of different Doctrines to unlock different units depending on the strategy, for example : you can use defensive doctrines or aggressive assault doctrines. Doctrines basically grant you with special units like elite infantry, air strikes, artillary strikes, heavy tanks, flamethrower tanks etc. What I like about this game is that it is based on real units used in WW2 and teaches you how military units operate and need to coordinate to defeat the enemy. In simple words, it is a simulation of classic WW2 battles between the legendary armies. Ever wished to be a military General? Well here's your chance.

The game itself is realistic, but you can also play with mods who make this game even more realistic. The community is very active in making mods, skins, maps and campaigns.  You can play ranked vs. real players and against bots and friends, just to have fun.  The only thing I don't like is the DLC-Sh*t. You actually have to pay a lot (+100€) to get all contents of the game which is quiet sad.

I also play Men at War: AS2, and find this game to be more consistently intense, as you have alot less micromanaging to do, worrying about your resource income and victory points is the main concern, though it is not enough to win.

            "review_text": "I suppose it's around that time I should revise the review again given that I've still continued to play this game once in a while, on and off.  If you want a review with reasons you should consider purchasing this game, I apologize, but I won't be offering that here.  I'm going to try and keep things simple, and list off the reasons I can think of as to why I personally do not recommend this game based on my 600+ hour experience.  So, 1. I find the excess of DLC annoying. The thought that I have to grind away for about two hours every gaming session at the least to have a very slim chance of maybe getting a paid commander through the was spoils system that sells for $3.99 is depressing. (Sales are your friend if you really, really want these)  2. The single player campaign bored me to hell. Others might have enjoyed it, I didn't. I was disappointed, disinterested, and saw no reason to replay it after one run. It felt like a history circus cartoon, seeing Tiger tanks in Stalingrad and sappy drama instead of a narrative atmosphere that made me feel like I was up front and center in a war.  3. Multiplayer is a mix. If you've got friends you can have a great time, but if you're thinking of getting this game as a single purchase you may find yourself struggling to learn all the skills and counters necessary to be a competitor online (If you're like me and don't like losing all that much). Unfortunately there isn't an official tutorial and the campaign doesn't pressure you to take action and micro the same way multiplayer does, so playing it does not teach you the ropes of multiplayer. The ranking system, which I put most of my game time into, does not offer any rewards for grinding away for higher rank. And when you're at max level, that's it. Have a cookie.   I admit I like that patches for multiplayer come fairly frequently, so there's not too much bad to be said about multiplayer. It's not great without friends, though.  4. The game did not stick with its theme. I get it, I suppose. Making more factions means appealing to a larger, broader audience with an American and British army, but when it gets to the point that the original factions sit on old abilities and units that have their roles displaced or scrambled by a flux of new units for new armies (you have to pay for commanders too to get ALL the new units for the new armies, lol. Buy the army so you can buy DLC for the army, hehe) then there's something not quite right.   Unit variety in terms of infantry and armor is also pretty bland. Comon. 15 units on average for a faction? (Not counting additional ones you can get by using paid commanders. They usually only add 1 or 2 more, anyways)  So, I bought this game with the interest in walking through an epic historical narrative about the Eastern Front in single player and being able to do some sweet tactical uraaaaah with varied Soviet Armor and Infantry in multiplayer. I was disappointed.  Total cash paid: A small cashout of about $100",

            "review_text": "Somehow this game just ends up not being very much fun, at least from a single player standpoint. The campaign missions are long, dull, and repetitive. Before you get done with even the fifth mission you'll have grown tired of the 'capture a point, now hold it against near-infinite waves of enemies' trick. And spoiler alert: that isn't getting worn out anytime soon. You play that out in the second, fourth, fifth, sixth, etc. etc. etc.  Now, we're supposed to be playing as the Red Army, the force that historically and infamously used mass wave tactics to victory. Thus, the gameplay just feels ridiculous when the German forces are the ones who are throwing waves of bodies, while the player is limited to the triumphant return of the utterly silly population limiter. The population limits wouldn't even be that bad, but we're also still dealing with completely inflexible squads. Let's say you have four free population, but want to call in a conscript squad. Well you need six for that. Got four guys on a machine gun? You have to use grenades to frag your own troops to bring them down to just two people so you can free up six population to call your conscripts.  The game relies heavily on 'artificial difficulty'. There's no strategy to be found in the campaign. The enemy doesn't build units and send them to attack you. The missions exist in two states - in the first state, the gameplay is completley static. Enemies don't attack, and you have all the time in the world to slowly creep your way across the map. In the second state, you're facing the infinite waves of enemies, as you try to hold three points with two squads against literally HUNDREDS of enemies. That's it. That's the gameplay. Any sort of 'tricks' the AI has up its sleeve is entirely limited to scripted sequences. You attack a point, and a wall collapses and a tank drives through. Not because the AI has a tank and it's using it, but because the developers decided to make the game 'hard' by having you fight tanks with infantry. This is further compounded by the fact that they constantly 'turn off' the tech trees as you play. In mission 5, where you liberate Stalingrad, you have access to halftracks, T-34 tanks, and rocket launchers. In mission 6, where you clean up Stalingrad (and you also have to face - again - waves of armor and troops) they take away everything except your infantry. Again: artificial difficulty. The AI is terrible, so in order to make it 'hard' we're just going to arbitrarially force you to fight what might as well be Leopard 2 tanks and Eurofighters with broomsticks and rocks.  My favorite example of this is the sixth 'secure Stalingrad' mission. The only anti-armor weapons you get are anti-tank grenades and anti-tank guns. The enemy has a freaking flamethrower halftrack. It impossibly takes over four head-on hits with a 76mm anti-tank cannon to destroy it (because halftracks are known for their armor?), so it just drives up, flamethrowers your gun crew and kills them instantly, and then burns all your infantry to death, and drives away.  It's not a bad game, but it does absolutely NOTHING interesting or new, and it very much begins to feel like they just copy-pasted one level to the next. I'm not joking about that 'hold out against waves of enemies' thing being used on almost every single level either. This is World War 2, not Orcs Must Die. Not every battle was spent fighting as the underdog against waves of troops. The Germans get tanks in almost every mission, I'm lucky if I even get halftracks. There's almost no options for static defenses anymore either.   I normally am a huge fan of Relic games, but this is such a bland, uninspired offering that I'm giving it a thumbs-down.",

The balance updates were (usually) fair and the gameplay was fun. But then came the first wave of strife: they added Oberkommando west and Americans. The Oberkommando were fun with their fast vehicles, excelent infantry and brainnumbingly tough special units. The Americans were not so lucky with their unspecialized infantry, weak vehicles and no heavy vechicles Mighty Relic Entertainment desided to hepl the Americans by nerfing everyone else, making Americans more favourable faction. Players were outraged by this for now Russians had no damage output and German units were too expencive to compete with the now OP Americans.  Relic didn't listen the pleads for balace update for their Sega overlords wanted all that sweet DLC money. But Sega wasn't satisfied but the sales that the Ardennes Campaing and the new factions brougth them. They wanted more, much more. Relic then made the Germans OP (for they were the most fun to play with) and the Allied community prayed a counter for their unstopable tanks and infantry. Relic answered those prayers by releasing the British: the faction with the superior defence structures and infantry. After Sega was contempt with the newest DLC sales, Relic nerfed the British and the germans were once again OP (for they were the most popular with their fun equipment and good commander rosters)  Now there is only strife for Relic doesn't care for the community: they need more DLC to satisfy thei Sega overlords. Maybe the game could be saved with a German Campaing or a proper balance update but for now it is buggy, badly balanced game with nothing that Men of War series can't do better.

            "review_text": "Company of Heroes 2 is a decent RTS but isn't really an improvement over the original.  It offers the same strategic experience as its predecessor, valuing map control above all else. You can win by destroying your opponent’s base but it’s almost always more beneficial to hold specific points.  The campaign is unfortunately a bit forgettable, as it completely betrays COH's micro based gameplay. You're given a constant supply of sacrificial soldiers which remove a lot of the strategic elements of the game. The campaign doesn’t require a whole lot of skill and doesn’t offer much of a sense of accomplishment.  The narrative is somewhat interesting but it isn’t up to par with some other RTS campaigns such as Warcraft 3 or Starcraft 2.  The multiplayer is still challenging and strategic although I think the game would have benefited from having more factions to choose from as you can only play as Russia or Germany. There's also a limited selection of maps available and they aren't quite as interesting or varied as the first Company of Heroes.   The worst issue is the microtransactions, which easily add up to more than the cost of the game itself. Anything from overpowered commanders, vehicle skins, and additional missions can be purchased which should have otherwise been included in the game.  Overall, it's still a fun RTS but it’s simply a shadow of the original. For a more in-depth review, here's a video I made:         Analog Reviews: Company of Heroes 2&nbsp;",

Since the last three major updates, the game still goes through massive ring around the nerf hammer which hits Axis forces more often than Allied forces which means if you were looking to play as Axis a lot, prepare to be dissapointed in most logical situations.  There is no historical balance or logic to the combat mechanics of the game and instead relies heavily on an RNG mechanic for 'to hit' 'damage dealt' 'cover saves' and 'armor saves' which means even if your unit is incapable of realistically damaging the target, chances are you still can and vice versa.  A great example of this is dedicated anti-tank units and self propelled guns taking multiple hits to destroy light vehicles, normally the same for all units regardless of vehicle class. IE: Jagdpanther Veterancy 5 can hit a light scout car and deal only 50% of its hp threshold in damage yet on a frontal armour penetration against a T-34/85 it can deal almost 60%. Logical? Not in the slightest.  If you play against the AI, it has access to all doctrines at the same time but does a very good job of hiding this unless you pay attention to the globals it uses. For example the Russian AI will almost always have access to Propaganda Artillery Strikes even if the Commander they use doesn't have access to it. When playing against the AI, it's recommended you use one of the 'All Unit' mods which at least make the game somewhat fair and balanced.  When playing competitively, it's best to just do smaller player counts because most factions are not balanced on late tier games seen in 3v3s and 4v4s in which certain factions are punished heavily such as the USForces only having one premium doctrine that has a heavy tank compared to all the OKW and Heer having access to multiple heavy tanks regardless of doctrine.  Certain units are still bugged such as the crewing and recrewing of abandoned units on certain maps will result in the unit disappearing and being unable to be commanded, destroyed, or pulled out of combat. While rare, it's still in the game and it was a problem since beta two years ago. Tanks still can't aim on elevation which means if you want to really ♥♥♥♥ someone off, go up a hill and shoot down, 90% of all shots unless the player decides to manually control will go straight into the ground right in front of said vehicle.  Only buy this game when it is on sale for 60-80% off. If you are smart, don't buy any of the DLC unless it's 75% off or more. There is occasional free commanders at different times of the year so if you are patient, you can rack up some decent ones in addition to random drops. (Which don't even give you drops to your faction half the time.)",

This would be the only reason why i still play this game. On with the gripes now.  PROS=  Neat little 'true sight' adds a depth of realism and strategy to the mix of RTS. Cleverly placing a bunker in an alley facing outwards with a mg42 can trap soviet infantry real quick.  This is WWII and Coh baby and thus nice things happen. Things happen like hearing what sounds like a tank rolling around near by making you feel as if your that soldier. 'Tiger!!!' lol. Or plowing a Tiger through a wall and spooking the hell out your enemy. Sound is amazing especially if you have a sound system or a decent pair of headphones. Now with the map builder theres an endless amount of maps and game modes available to you and honestly you dont have to touch it. Just hop on the Steam Workshop and Presto your looking at creative map from players like you and me. I do like the variety of generals and the different supports they offer but... theres always a but.   Cons=  ... I dislike that theres always one support you want that is not on the general you need. You cant pick and choose and you always have a support that you will not use or that is usless to your playstyle. There still seems to be glitches here and there. one of them that is quite annoying is the german mg42 will set up and not fire for some time. a couple seconds nothing to crazy but thats all it takes for soviet infantry to rush up and throw a molotov. Today I sat in a game and had to tell my pioneer squad to rapair my PZR4 5 times!!! NO!! i need that repaired like YESTERYEAR! Multiplayer. Multiplayer. Multiplayers nice. If you mind waiting for at least 10 min at times. Other than that its quite fun actually. The biggest problem though is within the ai itself and that is blamed on the creators. Im not going to lie I only play Germans since i picked up the game during beta. The last two updates have beefed up the soviets pretty good. Mortors now no longer need a scout. infantry spam is plentyfull and boy do they use it. molotovs are a cheap commodity and is also used. QUITE OFTEN! and i dont frown upon that. During WWII soviets had more than double the infantry compaed to the Germans. The only thing that differed though is training. Im pretty sure an MG42 team will mow down the hell out of 2 squads of soviet infantry thats 5 feet in front of them. but no soviets somehow have that finese to run straight up almost every time and toss that flaming bottle of love. The harder you choose the ai the more it will cheat. I played regular dificulty and i could manage on my own and if i screwed up i can regain the map rather quickly. Now that is not true. Ill get infantry spammed, and before i get my first tank out the enemy will have 2 and plenty of support. ???? seriously! and its just the same with 2 players vs ai. Actually its worse because 2 tanks turns to 4 and infantry spamming and molotov spamming doubles. I like doubling coupons not molotovs or tanks grenades. -_- soviets had numbers and cold(and Vodka). Germans had training, tactics and better tanks.   oh and yes DLC is a pain. Sure they need to make the money and all but theres a limit. The least you can do is offer everything to those who pre ordered way before to kickstart the funds. -_- greed is the fire that burns our soul.   Wait to buy this game when its at a lower price  ",

Everything else in this game is not worth the resources.   All units are watered down. Infantry is a joke; it's pointless. The trees in all armies are TERRIBLE. Not even fun like the first one. There is no strategy in this except to blob.   The maps are hideous and no time was put into any of them. They're all similar.   Just someone going through and placing down buildings and brush totally at random. Go look at COH 1 maps and look at any of these. There is a massive difference. All COH 2 maps resemble each other and there's no rhyme or reason to any of them, just cheaply done.  Most maps are cut out and purchasble as additional content. Like any decent commanders.  The game is also set up that if you want to win scenarios you're going to have to buy the better commanders with the better content. The ones provided are pretty useless and weak.   Commander abilities are nothing special either like the first COH, just junk and shared across each other.   Tanks are the game. If you like tank spam guy this piece of total garbage.

Going back to the game recently, it appears that at least the netcode issues have largely been resolved so (yay Relic!) on that part. A lot of my criticisms of the original release have by and large been resolved, though I will still point out some problems in the game.  The publishers have taken the action of raising DLC prices on their in-game Store during major sales while giving discounts to make it seem as though you are receiving discounts off the item, which is not true as it is not only unethical and anti-consumer, but is also illegal in many regions. Should I also point to the fact that there are some fairly important bugs that were only uncovered recently despite the game having been released for quite a few years now (one being veterancy gained for reinforced squads).  DLC I think is still a major issue for the game, but SEGA being SEGA... Some of the DLC do affect gameplay ever so slightly which can be fairly annoying if you're just starting out and don't want to spend money on the commanders.  Last but not least, I'm happy they launched the game on Linux and Mac (though not too glad the multiplayer isn't cross-platform between Windows and the other two versions - explanation from Feral  here ).

In the first case, everything that was wrong with USSR was admitted by Russians in an awful lot of books and studies. It's all up for you to read. Largely explained, with many photos of those times. If you wish to explore it quicker, you can watch some documentaries on this topic. Most of which are made by Russians, by the way. Nobody else is as interested in rooting into WW2 as Russian people. This war took a lot of their lives. They took the hardest punch, went through it hand to hand with Allies and regular people, like you and me. Everyone was united by a cause Germans would never figure out. To defend their kind. Germans had a little..different ideals.  What Relic did with Company of Heroes 2 is called  defamation .  Being Polish, you should probably know the term very well. (referring the guy in the comments section)  So what Relic does is not only show us the 'dark face' as you might say, but instead of making an incredible story of a horrible event they make a propaganda-fueled movie in style of US movies of 1960. The 'bad commie' type of film.  There is a huge difference between narrated storytelling based on proven facts with a huge pile of evidence, and making this crap.  I love history. I love reading books, finding rare videos of those times, looking at old and exquisite photographs that might seem uninteresting to most people. Photos of regular people standing united by a cause. And no, I don't mean Nazis in this case. I'd say they were more divided in ideology than anyone.  But I hate it when people who can manipulate masses blow the only thing they were supposed to do - tell the facts, and make them seem real. The drama, the horror of World War 2 should be in place. A mother burrying her own son, a man dying on arms of his fellow friends, children preparing for what they are going to face, people hearing the sirens, looking at the skies and knowing what is going to follow. All of this should be put in place.  The war was fought by the real people. The real people died in this war, not those plastic figures for whom the only reason to fight is so they won't be punished by the command.     (As shown by Relic)     Popular magazines who reviewed the game with scores of 8 and higher were probably paid to skip the campaign and rate multiplayer only, which didn't change much. I love the snow blizzard, but that's it. New units and tons of paid DLCs don't make a game. Well they didn't some time ago, now it's considered a really nice effort.  Unfortunately, German propaganda worked too well, as Werner Naumann pointed out. It ricocheted against their own people, made their troops lose the war, but it works pretty well nowadays. For the most of people, that is. Like the Polish guy from comments below. Too many people are sheep who don't believe in things other than 'bad' or 'good'.  When people grow up they start wondering if there is really black and white, or is there something  beyond ? If the time isn't right for you, if you just stopped playing Call of Duty with your 12-year-old fifth grade classmates, buy this game and enjoy the campaign to the fullest. You'll love it.",

            "review_text": "Company of Heroes two, abreviated as CoH2 from here on out is a game that is famous for WW2 gameplay. However, being famous and well known, doesn't dictate quality, as past fancy graphics the same problems that plagued the first game, have sadly been brought over to the 2nd.  That is the stupid Ai movement system, this have ALWAYS been an issue, and in a game that features so many details and barriers that your vehicles and personell can get stuck on, it quickly turns into a nightmare. The other problem is the illogical 'balanced' weapons handling, tanks keep firing and often illogically have their rounds bounce off the opponent, but that tiny light tank that puffs off a round at your front scores damage on your heavy tank. All of this adds up to a lot of problems, this problematic system wouldn't have been so bad, unless the movement Ai was... Utterly crap, you need to have your tank reverse out of the field? Well they provided a nice 'Reverse' function button to tell the tank to back out of there, but you have a 50/50 chance of him ignoring it and turning his weak rear to the enemy and getting owned as a result.  And that is the flaw of this game, a flaw that the developers behind Men Of War series realized isn't fixable, no matter how much time you spend on Ai deployment you can NEVER EVER beat a superior human at navigating a tank through obstacles, so how did they solve it? In Men Of War, they allow the player to take control of the vehicle in question, something that in my circle of friends is called the 'END the stupidity key' since you hit the END key on your keyboard and you are in direct command and control. A function that you desperatly wish for in this game, but alas isn't there, it is time to realize you cannot fix a core problem and implement this Sega!  The other problem this game suffers from is... Microtransactions, camoflauged as DLC. Think you get the full game by buying this and all the DLC on the Steam store page? Guess again, you are still missing missions, maps and commanders that you have to BUY in game with REAL MONEY! Unlike traditional microtransaction games, these are things you pay for once, and then own for 'life' but it is still the exact same microtransactions at the core.  In short, if you want a fun time playing WW2 RTS games, buy the Men Of War series, yes their Ai has the same navigational problems, but at least you have the option to intervene and avoid a disaster, unlike CoH 2 where you will have to watch that precious tank or squad get smashed doing stupid things. If you are set on a CoH experience, you are better off buying CoH 1, it is very similar with Skirmish matches for Coop, but that game is complete without any nasty microtransaction junk.  If you heard about the coop stuff in this game and thought you got a nice Coop campaign? Forget about it, all there is, is some Skirmish missions where you start off with a different loadout, and some scripted Ai, like the Ai getting an illogical reinforcement that is then thrown at your position, there is no such thing as in Men Of War where you do it mission style to aqquire assets, and where that artillery gun may need to come down before you can move on your objective for an example.  In short, CoH 2 was a disappointment at launch, and hasn't gotten improved with the years since then.",

From the start this game falls flat on its face due to the outrageous price and loaded DLC that Relic claims is for 'continued support'. What a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Never until this decade has DLC gotten so out of control. Companies out there that make games with no DLC charge less for some of their games and patch them for years afterwards. But, enough about the horrendous business model that has lost my money and more about the game.  Company of Heroes 2 takes what the 1st one did and makes it bland. No longer are you able to approach a situation from multiple vectors of possibilities and are now forced to be aggressive. Trench wars, defensive positions, and the general concept of holding a point and inching forward no longer exists unless you build a custom map with a specific choke point that is designed to do just this. Commanders do very little other than offer a few units that you can't build or offer some weapons you normally wouldn't get. Don't think for an instant this is a direct equivalent to the doctrines in the first CoH because it isn't, not even by a long shot. T-34 85s are called in units and not build versus the 76s that are built. Tigers are called in and not built. Population is capped at 100 unless you manually change it in the map editor. No V1 rockets or other cool special abilities like calling in a King Tiger, JagdPanther, Pershing Tank, etc. Just a few fragmentation bombing runs, and plane strafes with some other abilities like camo, tank smoke, etc.  The game does do well graphically, I will give it that but I do not believe that is anyhwere near sufficient to call this a second game. Sounds are just as realisitic as they were in the first one but pathfinding seems to never have been improved. I guess they wanted to focus on vaulting over sandbags and walls instead of fixing critical issues from a game that suffered the same issues 7 years ago. Buying barbed wire cutters for engineers because they don't come with them, you know....cause engineers don't work in situations like that...or something.....   I really hate to fill a review with constant negatives so I will put a few of the things that this games does manage to do well. First, I like the concept that Germans and Russians can play on the same team. This slightly alters the single strategy concept that this game has embedded into its core. I also like that you can repair bridges if they are partially damaged instead of waiting until it is completely gone. Another great aspect of this game is that the physics have been improved. Tanks feel more like tanks as they rock when they shoot and get hit and actually have a reverse button so you arn't spam clicking or queueing your tank backwards like you had to in the first installment. Finally, capping points by standing near them is great. I no longer have to make sure my units are capping, all I have to do is get them within the area of effect for it to begin capturing.  Unfortunately, that is really all I can think of that makes the game look decent. All of the improper balancing due to a new and whiny community is holding this game back. I wish Relic would just balance the game as they see fit, it worked great for the first installment. Gamers are entirely to whiny and shed tears when something doesn't go their way, but then again that is the way most my country is. People will whine because they can't play, don't understand a concept, or simply just don't get their way but a game like this shouldn't be altered because of those reasons. Single minded strategy, a massively cheating AI, and horrendous balancing with laregely missing content make this game a no purchase unless you are either bored or get it during a massive sale, and by massive I mean 75% or more. Do yourself a favor, don't get burned.",

My question is: Where the HELL enemy gets resources with building such massive army while i with every resource points manage to build only ONE upgrade barrack to build tanks.

I was expecting a game with slow and laborious units with little territory gains, instead I got a point capture game with multiple strategic elements. My original post recommended this game. However, after I encountered so many BUG SPLAT errrors and disconnects. I've decided to thumb it down. It's also Pay To Win. They were selling the rare British commanders (Blue) for cash.  $9.75+$5+$3.25  PROS 1. No Bob-the-builder You don't have to build many production facilities to mass produce your armies. It really helps that you don't have to worry about issues like trapping your units within your building maze.  2. Model Orientation Having a zone of fire, front and back armour, angled shots and wall blocking really helped in creating strategy for the game. This is the one thing I don't really see in other Real Time Strategy Games, rushing from the front or the back yields the same result for other games.  3. Campaign A lot of historical significance from World War II. I am unsure of its accuracy but I do hope that they got important details like dates, names, locations, who won and what went on correct.  4. Unit Cap / Pop Cap Works pretty well. Having lesser units to control helps to balance the game for those with lower Actions Per Minute (APM)  5. Retreat Very convenient button. It's good to use when you want your troops to run fast and back to base. Don't know why only infantry have them. Vehicles do not have retreat functions oddly.  6. Terrain and Weather Surprisingly, there are a lot of interesting terrain. Ice which breaks when fire upon or when heavy tanks run over. Snow and Mud which affects your movement. Blizzards which kill your infantry (don't really like this one since tanks seems invulnerable to blizzards, making them more valuable).  CONS 1. DLC, DLC, DLC Everything I see on the store page is DLC, DLC, DLC. It is annoying to know that you can't play certain sides unless you splash out the dough. I've heard that there are expansion packs but you can see that they are divided into smaller packs.  2. Retreat You can't stop the troops mid way of a retreat. They run all the way back to bask. I would prefer some kind of retreat that lets you choose either 50% or 100% of the distance back. Why? Because some times I just want to flank and I need to move fast, but retreating at 100% means I have to call them at base.  3. No quick end strategy There is no zerging in this game. You can't just end the game early as all bases have machine guns and infantry die very easily to them. I don't know if this is actually that bad.  4. Mine placement Very, very slow and tiny. No circle to show the radius of explosion. They only work well with chokepoints. I was hoping if they could make a grid (minefield) instead of an extended line. Since the mines cost ammunition to plant, players can't spam them abitrarily. Also, more mines would make mine detection actually useful. You could also add abilities to scan for mines that way.  5. Mine sweeping Absolutely redundant. If there is mine, there is usually a machine gun guarding. So, the engineer has trouble removing it. Never played a game where engineers needed mine detection.  6. T1&gt;T2&gt;T3 Most games tend to be won by a high tech tank domination. The game seems to end only when one side builds up their most powerful heavy armour tanks e.g. Tiger Ace, Panther, KV-8, Elefant. I don't really remember games when light and medium tanks won.  7. Bug Splat Errors ****** Too many to count. Every time someones disconnects it's usually a Bug Splat error or a map problem. The game is complete at all. The errors just occur randomly or when servers are full.",

The matchmaking system is HORRIBLE. Why not just let me screen for games on a browser and join them? Why only let me select one choice for a match, when I may be open to several different types of games? Matchmaking systems should always be optional.  The way they changed infantry and vehicle balance also made the game feel much more vehicle focused. Most infantry, even some antitank infantry, don't stand a chance against tanks. They just drop like flies, even under cover (though it might also be the hacking AI). The AT guns are also clunky and require just as much pop cap as a small or medium tank.   The AI cheats like crazy for comp stomp games. Example: you cannot field any snipers because they will be killed magically by magic mortars and other freak shots. You can only play certain tactics against the AI, as all the other normal tactics will fail to their horrible hacks (worst than the first one, not even fun, why not put some more thought into AI?).

Game comes down to how fast you can click and manage your blobs of men. Not much room for tactical gameplay either as everyone is rush rush rush. Games are usually over before you get any chance to build that large tank. I liked the original better. Alot more building stuff, healing friends, setting up defences.

It is a most real war game I have ever seen (well may because I didn't see much games), although some small details are still funny, such as soldiers cannot shoot the enemy within 1 or 2 feet away , or AT can shrek Konigstiger's front armor. Well. I know a game need balance.  Cons:  Well, but the balance sucks.  Also, the game is tied with too many DLCs and you must use lots of money to play the full version. Kinda reminds me of SIMS3.   I am not a expert of this, but my laptop could run Skyrim smoothly with a max display set , but why I could only use low set in this game and still couldn't run smoothly? I don't think Skyrim's image is that bad.  The anti-communism story sucks. I won't say communism is a good thing but as a history game you should respect history, not just put some urban legend or fairy tales in order to prove commi is bad. Make up history is really gross. Ew. COD5 has better stories, it reveals bad things of both sides of the war and give reasons. Remember NO MATTER GERMANS OR SOVIETS, MOST SOLDIERS ARE COMMON PEOPLE, NOT DEVILS. Please show respect to soldiers and to history.   By the way why this game don't have a Chinese version? Judging by the comments in Chinese I would say there are many Chinese playing. It is well-known that copyright protection is terrible in China but many Chinese now showing their will by using steam to buy games and I believe these people deserve a second chance.  It could be a great game. However it falls into this . Shame on you, SEGA.",

I send a tank against one of theirs (of equal strength), mine misses half the time or careens off their armor, theirs almost always penetrates so that the end result is my tank is destroyed, and theirs is maybe at half health. One of their infantry squads can get shot at from (for example) two tanks, an AT gun, a machine gun crew and a squad of my own infantry and they will still capture to point (or at least uncap it) before having to flee, and they aren't even under cover. But if one of my own infantry comes under fire from one of their infantry, and mine is in green (strong) cover, my guys will lose the fight. I could expect something like this from hard, but this was an EASY AI.  I don't really appreciate that the game has been divided up piecemeal into DLC, either. I like the new things, but I don't want to have to pay over $100 to play everything. This is a sad way of doing things, and though many companies are doing it nowadays, it's not right, and it causes me to avoid their games. The only reason I own Company of Heroes 2 is because I preordered it last year. I didn't know that it would have DLC at the time, otherwise I would likely have avoided it, too. Honestly, it feels like an expansion to the first game, and not a whole new game, either. The graphics are no better than the first, they've really only added some atmospheric effects.  This game is a letdown. I expected a lot more out of CoH2, and have been sorely disappointed each time I played it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.",

Perhaps it was my fault, but even after asking on the game forums about problems I still have not found a solution to my woes which I will get to after I actually talk about the game.  I can't really recommend this game at all. The first reason is the balance issues plaguing this game. It seems to favor both German factions and British Forces while telling US Forces and Soviets to fall in a ditch. Germans get better units earlier in the game and at reasonable costs while Allied factions are usually underpowered and expensive. New commanders are made obsolete when new ones are available for purchase (yes, for purchase) or you can find them, if the game decides to give you drops. Which after the past few times I played with my friend never happened where I never got EXP or drops after a match was finished. There really feels like there is no incentive to play as Allies when their armor is almost completely outclassed by anything the Germans can throw at them.  Now for the technical issues. There are plenty.  For a while I had a problem launching this game properly. I never feel you should have to go into the game files and disable functions and files just to launch it with no issues.  I don't have the best video card but I was able to get playable framerates a year ago before I switched my mobo and CPU. COH2 hates these for some reason as I am not able to decipher why all my other games work with minimal problems but this game lays an egg when I try to play online. Things start well until about fifteen minutes into a match when I get told my settings are too high and I become victim to input lag. By the time I get to the end game, I suffer input lag of upwards of twenty minutes before I see my units respond to my orders.  Twenty. Minutes.  Even after following all the advice I was given I still experience trash like this. My friends told me they just use my idle units as a barricade to build up their forces before wiping out the enemy. It makes me feel good when my pals tell me 'You make a great wall.' Really makes me feel like I'm part of a team. For a game exclusive to the PC it doesn't work very well on a rig that at the time of writing this is passable.  After everything I've seen and experienced in the game I can safely say you can skip this. I only bought this to play against AI because I never felt good enough to play against others. Some people are probably already reading this review and calling me a dumb noob for such reasons, but I don't care. I feel that until Relic focuses more on trying to balance the game (and maybe trying to discover the root of these issues I face) instead of farming money out of me, I put this as not recommended.",

It's a bit overhwelming, and deceiving. It's pretty bad, because I know I bought the game one sale with some gift cards I had, but Amazon doesn't allow you to purchase the DLC here, in game. My other complaints about this game. -Removed tactical mode. WHY? Tactical mode while I use it only 3-4 times in a game, it's like 'Lost unit.' What unnit, oh snap! I lost my ...(insert fav unit here.) It's also way to hard to control a large army. I mean without tactical mode you are cripled. -Removed and nerfed howizers. Now howitzers only 'target' a place rather then have a circle of range. I hate this. It's so much harder to select kill unit here, then the circle.  -Made it a slight pay 2 win game. -Units don't follow commands as they are too literal. IE attack move is broken. I was going to rate this up, but these things really are essential to the gameplay. I like how they made it a custom game, but there's a lot of things about this-- if they were I would add things like cosmetics, where you could make futuristic warefare. etc, etc, etc  I also want them to add in the Japanese as a faction and not a new game, in fact just make a new campaign with the japanese and the reds. This would fit in since it's not well known. The Japanese were fighting the USA, AND the russians who launched missiles at them. The russians also hated this because they lost this war BADLY  Things they did well. Created a more streamlined game. A game that has more realistic warfare, units move and have better pathing. Add in changes into the commanders. Better graphics, adaptability it can run on any machine litterally it may slow down, but it's not about graphics, that just adds into the equation...The reader probably can figure out all the things that they've done well so I don't need to go into all that detail it's just the things that everyone hates. You also can earn them.",

Any how I like the overall game its fun and with all the maps available theres plenty to do. However, I feel like just about everything good with the origanal game was removed or redone and more often then not made worse in the second, again i enjoy the second very much its just not up to par with the origanal game. Theres not enough variety in the command trees even though there are alot, they all just unlock the same basic abilities with one unique one. theres are some imbalances between opposing units , like i don't understand how a conscript squad is capable of bringing down an MG team without any support?! Stuff like that. The one last issue i had was alot was lost in tactics and defense in the original i loved being able to build monsterous defenses and just watch as the enemy attacked or when i'd create choke points and killzones to trap the enemy. In the second its really about who can move faster and get their best units first. When you play if you rush right away and bring up even light vehicles asap you are basically going to win.   Now like i said in the begining i do enjoy this game its fast paced and competative and if you play someone experienced then theres a good chance you're in for a tough match. The game runs smooth, i really enjoyed the campaign especially the later missions and matches don't drag out. Basically i guess... I do not think it is as good as the first game but its still fun, so if you've played the original and really liked it this probably isn't for you, but if you are looking for a fun RTS game thats fast paced and competative go for it.  On the Western front add on its fun and its nice having more factions to work with but it only adds the factions for use in multiplayer thats it... not worth 20 bucks want a while.",

This game is all about getting to high stages quick, and going for the tanks. There isn't much you can do to an enemy with a tank, if you don't have tanks yourself.  Ridiculously high amount of munition is gathered in every match. Fuel is the real problem. So basicly, tanks are the top priority units in the whole game. You can't do a 'machine gun + sniper + AT' combination like you could do in CoH1, now you have to go 'machine gun + mortar (who are riddiculously buffed in CoH2 + tanks as soon as possible'. This narrows the diversity you could enrich in whilst playing. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game unless you caught it off a good discount.  I'd give this a 6/10, if CoH1 is 9/10.

            "review_text": "This game is very bi-polar, it's a beautiful game, very asthetically pleasing, very immersive and historical. The gameplay captures the strategy and tactics, and the feel of World War 2. However the game mechanics involve a lot of really annoying RNG and unrealistic features, especially when it comes to the British.  Lelic has secret documents revealing that the Bofors AA gun can fire High velocity shells as an artillery suppressive barage, because logic.  Secret documents also reveal that the Germans did not execute the Mentally ill, no instead they trained them as tank crews.  Other secret documents show features that no one but Relic knows about history like... -the Vickers, (a WW1 machine gun) was apparently the best machine gun of World War 2. -British emplacements can 'brace' making the people in them completely invincible no matter how much you set them on fire or blow them up. #realism -The Churchill was actually just as well armored as a King Tiger, so the British can get a faster equivalent of a tiger, but it also has a flamethrower that kills all infantry in a 25 meter radius instantly, making it invulnerable. -The AVRE has better armor than a sturm tiger, and also has the same blast radius when it fires (even tho it didn't IRL) and it can move faster, also doesn't have to stop when it reloads (but the sturm tiger does) -The German Pak 43 emplacement can shoot through buildings and hedgerows, apparently the Germans had rail gun superlaser technology. -The Comet Tank was barely produced in WW2, but in this game it's the backbone of the British, it's the strongest medium tank in the game, by far. There is not a single German heavy tank I would want more than the Comet Tank, it's as well armored as a panther, but can throw grenades at infantry, and do emergency wartime speed, turning it into an invincible race car. -RNG in this game is really bad, makes for scenarios in which a T-34 will beat a Panther in a 1v1 (this actually happened to me) which shouldn't happen because panther's are twice as expensive (and the Germans literally built them to counter allied tanks like the T-34) -RNG will also screw you over with indirect fire, especially as Germany, because of your small 4 man squads, and the fact that they really like to all clump up, RNG will often cause a mortar or rocket artillery to instantly squad wipe your men. -Hit boxes in the environment are terrible, after a buidling gets destroyed it's hitboxes are still up, resulting in incredibly annoying incidents such as a bombing run that doesn't hit the men you targeted, instead it hits the invisible building and the bombs literally explode from impacting the air (has happened to me several times and can ruin a game. -The Oberkommando West was actually a late-war German army but in this game they don't get the MG 42, they only get the MG 34, and all of the Allied MGs are better, even though all of the Allied MGs are from WW1 and the German ones were the best ones in actual history. -last but not least pathfinding, it's not just the German tanks who's crews are mentally ill, every tank in this game struggles to figure out how to drive, often doing things like randomly deciding to confront an enemy tank by reversing into it and asking to get it's engine destroyed instantly. Or when you ask it to reverse out of a hot spot, it decides to do a random 360 for no reason, and then reverse, and in most cases it will be destroyed in the time it takes to turn around. The worst is when there are two tanks within the same square mile, they are bound to run into eachother and then take the next 10 minutes to figure out how to get around eachother, so most of the time they will stop and continue to turn back and forth, failing to actually go wherever you told them to, and likely dying while they sit there uselessly. -infantry pathfinding is appalling too, first of all there are many glitches in which infantry will get stuck on a clump of trees just because the obstacle boxes on the environment are way too bug, even though visually it looks like it would be perfectly possible for the infantry to get out of there. Support teams like mortar and MG crews will often wait 5-10 seconds to pack up their weapons and retreat, which means they will often sit there under fire or literally standing in a field of lava from incendiary artillery, but won't reatreat as you told them too until after they are dead. Infantry also sometimes continue in their state of 'retreat' even after they get back to your base, so you can't use them for the rest of the game and they are just sitting there hogging up population. The retreat pathing is the single most appalling thing in the game. The retreat pathing is so simple even I could have coded it, all infantry do when you tell them to retreat is take the closest path toward your base, which means in a lot of cases they will 'retreat' toward the enemies that are shooting at them. I'm sure you can imagine how well that ends up going.  For a game that has so much potential to represent the feel of World War 2 combat, this game fails, there's so many gameplay nuisances that make this game geared much more toward luck than skill. Which is not the way an RTS should be. World War 2 certainly had a lot of RNG involved realistically, but not to this extreme, there were reasons besides pure luck and unrealisitc ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that the Allies won, but that's not simulated in this game.  Despite my constant bashing on how OP allied factions are , I'm not biased, I don't actually just play Germans even though that's what it looks like, I have extensive experience in my 400 hours playing with all 5 of the factions, and the U.S. is my favorite, but the game is way too unbalanced that I don't enjoy either side, I feel like a hacker playing as the invincible British, and even the Germans have really annoying things they can do like building the Pak 43 rail cannon that can phase through buildings. I'm tired of dealing with how annoying the gameplay features, bugs, and RNG is in this game, don't look at my time played, it's 400 hours too many, I'm uninstalling the game, wish I could get my money back.",

            "review_text": "Having played the original Company of Heros I had high hopes when I saw the sequal on sale. Needless to say I was disapointed. It didn't take many hours of gameplay to notice the complete absence of two core features that made CoH great. This was the complete removal of the command point system. In CoH one of the most defining features of the game, atleast in my opinion, was the command point system. Through battle you earned points for defeating enemies, caputing points, and so on. You then could use these points to purchase upgrades for your selected play-style or 'company'. In CoH2 this is absent replaced instead by set abilities, most of which are almost completely useless, or so expensive they aren't worth using, and there is no way to actualy spend the command points you earn! The points count up and unlock the set abilities. The second thing missing was variations in story. In CoH you could play as the U.S. Army's Able company, the Comonwealth's Expeditionary Force, or as the elite Panzergrenadiers of the Third Reich. Each army had different play styles and tactics as well as unique missioins and objectives. In CoH 2 the only story avaliable is that of the Soviet's Red Army, which while definitely a new feature, as they were excluded from the first game, does get old after awhile.  The addition of the U.S. Army and German Oberkomando West in the 'new' Ardennes Assault expansion brought us a completely useless german faction which takes too long to train sufficient forces and has had ALL support weapons (MG and mortars) as well as snipers removed. The U.S. faction is just as slow with the requirement to access a building being the recruitment of an officer that is 1. Totally useless in battle and 2. Takes forever to train.  While the addition of the British Forces does expand the army selection, it also does something else, something Relic/Sega are notorious for: it un-balances the game! In the beginning you had two (2) armies: The Soviets (allies) and the Wermacht (Axis) a 1:1 ratio which meant that multiplayer matches would have equal amounts of a specific side. Even with the OKW and USF the balance was maintained because what did you get? Again one Ally and one Axis. The problem with the Brits is no Axis faction was brought in with them as a counterpart and as such the force ratio now stands at 3:2 Allies:Axis. I just played a 3v3 with two OKW and one Wermacht against one Soviet one Brit and one US army. We got obliterated. Sega needs to fix the A.I. so it has to deal with fog of war, resources, population, basicaly play by its own rules. They also need to re-balance the factions by releasing another Axis army. I hear Italy and Japan are being asked for.  The multiplayer components (both PvP and PvE are virtualy dead. You can find yourself waiting nearly tewnty minutes for a match! Keep in mind this is will all difficulties and map sizes ticked as well as no map vetoes. So right now the singleplayer campaigns are just about your only viable avenue of play.  At last we get to the good part. The A.I. I don't know if Relic programed the computer to be this hard from the begining or if they slowly increased the base dificulty over time. People say that 'standard' level enemies are easy. I say they either lied or they hack their games. Because standard enemies are impossible to defeat. one on one maybe but get any bigger than that and you can forget it. I don't understand the cumpulsion to make games so hard that they cease to be ANY fun to play, and CoH 2 has fallen into this trend. The A.I. swarms you will impossible numbers even on easy and your A.I. allies don't even try to resist. Worse yet, the A.I. cheats. It isn't restricted by recource income. In fact you can take EVERY point on the map (this should mean that the enemy is down to single-digit income) and the enemy is still sending medium armor and infantry as if they never lost ground. The A.I. is also omnipotent, it knows the locations of all units at all times. Which explains how the enemy can always seem to move their infantry JUST out of your grenade range. Lastly, this is my favorite, the A.I. Doesn't build units, which would cost resources, it spawns them. This ties back to how the A.I. can achieve numbers that should be impossible in both cost to produce and population limit. The A.I. is un-fetted by either limitation but if you watch a replay and do the math you'll find that the amount of enemies on the map shouldn't be possible as you can't train that many because your population will fill up.",

This is also the most unbalanced game I have ever seen, the Axis being inferior on the early game and they need alot more resources to get up, one of them is fuel. If you grab the fuel from the axis early as the americans for instance, (which has the best infantry) You'll basicly win the game, because the axis is so terrible early and will never be able to upgrade without fuel.

Pathfinding, this game is out for 3 years and your units still move and retreat like an Idi0t. For example straight through machine gun fire or into a blob of units.  2. Allies are strong, since the new patch allies have become even more powerfull. Take a look at the king tiger it is so bad, the jackson from the USF are rekking this unit without worries and jackson got a buff, same goes for the jagdtiger or normall tanks from the AXIS. They are underpowered while all allied tanks are in that case overpowered.  3. As I stated above, Balance issues. There are so many balance issues with this game, that is unbelievable. I don't even know where to start. I don't know what relic is doing when they are working on a 'patch' that is breaking the game and we need to wait another 2/3 months before it is fixed again. If it aint broke don't fix it.  In conclusion overall it is a good game with a good singleplayer, but I will give it a thumbs down because Germans are underpowered, I play both AXIS and ALLIES and it is so relaxing to play as Allies. I mean you don't even care if you lose because then you know you got outmoved. But if you play as AXIS you know there is so much bull♥♥♥♥.  If Germans and especially the tanks got a major buff I would give this game a 8.5/10  Right now 6.5/10",

The bulletins you get randomly (if at all) from playing the game atan rate that implies that they think you do play their game 24/7 for the next ten years.. i.e. don't waste your energy you won't get what you want but you can dump exorbitant ammounts of money into their DLC's.

When they add new nations, they just plow through everything. It seems like the developers never test out anything before they release it and then they use 4 month to just nerf the ♥♥♥♥ out of anything that is OP instead of giving it minor nerfs and balance it. I like to play as the germans because at the time of this review they are the underdogs (this may change) and it is almoast impossible to win against the allies if the other players have a hint of common sense.

I mean, come on! How can a low level non-paying player beat someone with rare commanders that can summon Tigers or the more common IS tanks?!   What more BS is the fact that this game have balancing is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Why? Well it's like this, the Russian have like 6 men in a squad, even in an MG, while the German have like, what, 4? Now although it is historically accurate, it fails to balance the damn game if all Russian player I met just spam Maxim and just rush me with it. If they want to balance it they should make the Russian soldier died quicker since most of them are drafted men!  The only advantage a German can do is probably have an MG42 early, but that's it. It can be easily counter with Maxim spam. And what else? Oh, the British Forces are OP as crabs. Their Cromwell tanks can wiped out a squad of soldiers in a single shot, fight on par with a Panzer 4, and have great defense. WTF.   Oh and don't forget the money focused themes and levels and stuffs! This game, in my eyes although fun, is a shameful shadow of its former self. But hey! The modding community are fun!

            "review_text": "There's a couple of reasons why i don't recommend the game and ill go over them one by one.  First of all,there's little to no problem with the core game, gameplay is enjoyable with the combat holding up and the dynamic battlefield very appealing. In a lot of ways, its improvement over coh 1, shots to tanks and vehicles are more realistic(allthough US forces mostly have tin cans for tanks),graphics,overall gameplay,etc.  DLC's There must be about 30 commanders combined in the game but instead of getting them for free with the army you gotta buy them,and the skins,and the missions, you see where im going with this.  MODS The main problem i have with this game is what it is now, coh 2 on steroids,yep im talking about mods.Before this game i would have never believed mods could kill Coh for me, here some reasons why:   1.Match with mods enabled,require you to download them.simple right?Well, not anymore. If i join a match with a mod i don't have, the download won't start like it use to, making half of the matches on server unplayable.So if you want to play the match you gotta go to the steam workshop and download. 2.There so many mods in the game that i feel they have ruined the organic gameplay there once was,unit mods,skins,bulletins and all the unnessary stuff that just adds onto the pie and taints the recipe and taste. 3.With all the mods that have skins,bulletins and faceplates there's really no sense of achievement,no driving goal to EARN something allthough the reward system is a complete fail (ill explain why below)   I don't hate mods,especially the map mods.They add a lot of content that is free and boost playablity,  SERVER/s Not as populated as it used to be and i think its mainly because of the mods.Now,please understand that i myself use mods and love them with this game and others but try to picture this: You get out of work,you start up Coh 2 to relaxe and enjoy the game and you can't start either because: 1.not many people online 2.join a match but requires mod which doesn't want to directly download 3.join a match but its another unit mod or overhaul you don't like.  REWARD SYSTEM I remember getting a commander or two for free once at the end of a match,otherwise then that the game never really rewards you with what you want.It'll give you duplicates of what you already have,some boost for a unit i may never use and so on.The unit boosts really don't seem to affect your gameplay that much ex:some 2% faster reloads 3%cooldown between shots or a 5% better penatration.For me, a 10% less suppression for my inf unit was a good upgrade.  MISC why can't i summon more than one tiger tank,pershing,or some other special unit that isn't OP.Like come on!! I wanna roll in with two tiger tanks and bust someone's ♥♥♥♥ up! Its small things like this they call BALANCING and FAIR that i call LAME.A pershing is a big brother to the sherman tin can, the pershing was OP in coh1 but here, it ain't much different from a panzer 4 in terms of armor.  Mainly, it seems to me like the fan base for this game is dying out and the devs know it and its why they push all these dlc's to make as much money as possible for profit. If you really wanna play this game pick up the base game with the campaign and don't get sucked into the dlc's,believe me its not worth the money they're charging.",

            "review_text": "Dear players:  this used to be one of the best RTS games ever, now it's utter crap here is why:  1) Commander system is a cheap trick to milk the userbase, basically relic will release a new commander now and then that will add new units/skills these skills/units will be 'unbalanced' always to the overpower side, because they want you to buy them once you finnaly do these will be 'balanced' again to the nerf/useless side since 'community managers hear the user base' read: -we got all the money we wanted- why nef them back you say? because there has to be room for the next 'balanced' commander. while it's true that you can get them via grinding, that it's just an illusory way, you can spend over 1000 hours and you will not get the commander you want since the delivery system is waay too random.  2)Intell bullet-ins: This is even more unsettling these are passive bonuses awarded at the end of a battle or completing some archievements (just a few) they cannot be bougth with real money or anything; The problem is that there is always a combination of these passive bonuses that will make your game A LOT easyer, but unless you have a lot of luck you cant have them, so people (assuming they have about the same skill as you) can end up beating you because they had these combinnations, read: dumb luck; Again you too can eventualy end up having these combinations but it can take you days, weeks, months or never.   3) Relic does not hear the comunity: all the above was brougth to them YEARS AGO via forums, and they basically have just played dumb and just pretend as everything it's ok, changes have been made but way too late and always in a half-♥♥♥♥♥ way; as today im writing this their forums have been down in the main page for about 3 months, claiming a 'migration' that was supposed to be ready in january of this year we still got nothing so if you want to speak with a comunity manager or speak with other players in a official channel you can pudding yourself, like forever.   4) compared to the first game the quality has plunged: animations are pretty much recycled from the first game, the game suffers from an ennormity of technical bugs that i just wont enummertate since they are way too many and have been for way too long, relic claims that they are working on them but that's hard to belive.

GAMEPLAY I've played the game for 32 hours now and read guides on how to get resources, etc. but I found the game is severly resticed by the population cap which is far to small for British Forces to be effective, as they are too weak on their own until verteran, but can't reach that level as they are too easily wiped out by German forces. As such, even on the easiest setting against the AI, if lucky you reach a stalemate by bunkering down your forces, but can't then progress as all your population allowance is tied up in emplacements. The only way to then go is to let the placements be destroyed and hope you can spend enough resources on tanks before all the map points get captured. This then becomes a very hit and miss affair as the game turns from strategy to chaos. On more than two player maps, British forces will be spread too thin to capture points necessary and so are practically unwinnable.  GAME AI I've never got above playing one above the easy level, as there are too many aspects of the game that the AI can exploit to win and it becomes frustrating, as your chances of winning is just randomly decided by the map you play and which points the AI goes after first. The lack of consistency in the gameplay means you can't really progress past a few battles before the novelty wears off and you realise there's nothing you can do to improve your performance.  BUGS The game has bugs such as gaining achievements that don't apply to your army so simply disappear from your available bulletins. For example, I recently got a Guardians upgrade which only applies to Soviet forces?? Also game control is not reliable either and many a time I found myself left-clicking a weapon or control only for it not to be actioned until I go to select another of my items on the battlefield only for it to be targetted by the artillery bombardment I'd just tried to target the enemy with.  FINALLY... I was looking for a game that perhaps gave a realistic experience of strategic warfare and with regard the pointlessness and waste of effort involved, the game is unfortunately quite accurate. Basically a very dissapointing experience and I would encourage anyone looking to try this game to not waste your money.",

Overall Company of heroes 2 is very frustrating and has plenty of unrealistic situations For exaple it can happen that two enemy troop's litterally stand next to eachother and fire like crazy and it still take's 10-20sec. until one of the is dead ( there is no hand to hand combat)   If you want to buy a decent game stick with the original company of heroes it's much better and way more fun (Seriously company of heroes 2 is just one big pile of garbage)",

I know Sega might be in a finacial crysis since THQ went bankrupt and Sega continued the project but for ♥♥♥♥ sakes bad marketing plan Sega, I unistalled your game and said ♥♥♥♥ this game there are so many other games I would play that are World War 2 based and historically correct, that don't empty my pockets every single week you release DLC, the DLC is absolutley must have if u want to have content you should have for $60 and if you want to win your multiplayer matches. I recommend not to play this game, my number one choice instead of this is a game called Red Orchestra 2 Heroes of Stalingrad, great World War 2 game that doesn't have the cons I said on Company of Heroes 2.",

Before this patch, CoH2 was a rather balanced game with each side having their pros and cons. While late game German armor was a little unbalanced, it was an overall more enjoyable experience. Before the newest patch the game was probably a 9/10. However, after this patch unless you're playing as the Allies you're going to have an awful time. I WOULDNT recommend this game until they balance it with (hopefully?) subsequent patches. Relic claims to beta test all of their patches, however, this doesnt seem like the case.

I bought some Soviet &amp; German commanders for ~$15 only to find out that they don't show up in my inventory. I can't refund any of it because I played the demo more than I played the actual game. I was pretty mad. I mean, come on. Sega/Relic absolutely embarrased themselves with slicing a perfectly good game into 300 parts and selling it one by one for a rediculously high price. Now, with my new gaming rig, the DLC started working (Yay), and I changed my review. However, if Sega/Relic/AnyExtremelyGreedyGameDeveloper adds something that I don't like to this game, I WILL change my recommendation. I heard that it's ~$200 to get the full game!  7.5/10 would buy more DLC again  EDIT: Changed to not recommended. This game is so german-sided it's not even funny. I can't win a single game as the Red Army because of Panzershriek and Panzer spam. All my tanks are destroyed by the panzershriek spam, and all my infantry are murdered by the panzers.

The 'commanders' which are basically your special abilities cost ~3 Euros each! Theres dozens of commanders and each 3 Euros for some Abilities that you can start during the game, its literally insane! Noone would spend this kind of money on it.... UNLESS that this was the only way to get the interesting units. So obviously units like the Tiger, the Jagdpanther, the KV-8, the Fallshirmjaeger, the Calliope a.s.o. are all connected to commanders. Now while I even would agree some units being connected to the commanders, as it was when the game released, in order to stop people from using nothing but the strongest units, since then two main things changed, that make it unbearable.  1. The Commanders basically no longer unlock by themselves. They used to. In the beginning it was raining commanders on me like crazy, 10 hours in I had maybe ~15 Commanders to chose from. But in the last months I havent unlocked a single one.  2. They started putting units that were in the game already behind this paywall! For example the 'Westernfront Army' had an Artillery piece that could only fire one devestating shot before having to manually reload. This was great fun, both visually and audiobly (is that a word?) special by its explosion actually defeaning the player and added quite some depth since the self-propelled artillery was completly helpless during its long reload period. Everybody loved it. So obviously they patched the game in a way that this was no longer buildable but had to be called in by a 3 Euro Commander. I quite literally feel robbed.  This was IN MY GAME, in one of the DLC to be precise, meaning I already payed additional money for it, and now i am supposed to pay for it again?! What's next? They take away explosions and put it in the explosion DLC, then the sound for the sound DLC?  Never, ever, should we let it slide when ingame content that already was payed is later taken out to be sold back to us.",

I transfer it to another computer, a 2012 mbp which is running 'el capitan' and it says my computer doesn't have the requirements to run the game, not warning me in the system requirements that it doesn't accept my 8gb ram 2.4ghz i7 ssd computer because of my 4 year old graphics card (this game is 3 years old), so it just won't run. So I install 'el capitan' on the first computer which ends up causing a major issue with the business managing app account edge pro, where neither that company nor apple could fix the system-breaking issue, and after a day finally of install I play this messy, poor running game, despite having a very capable graphics card, again the information on the store page doesn't warn me. Not to mention the messy menu and the most extreme desperation of money grabbing pointless dlc shoved as advertisements constantly in my face on the messy main menu. Thanks for this one game to make me change my operating system and ruining other important apps when other games run fine, and for this to run poorly, have poor gameplay.. I do NOT recommend this.",

Then on i played it the houle day and didnt even won one game but i figured its just the beggining its normal then stayed the hole night wake just playing it and finnaly got a victory, and at that point i thought yhea i will just get better with time.  I was completly wrong i am so much better now in this days that i have played and All the factions that belong to the allies are so ♥♥♥♥ing OP i mean before i can even get a Stug (its a tank) I allready see like 4 stuarts, or 4 T34 tanks i mean What the ♥♥♥♥ with out even saying that the americans have extremely good infantry the ♥♥♥♥ing brits just need to camp and start playing simcity and building their ♥♥♥♥ing bunkers and the russians are like a hooker that is pregenant with ♥♥♥♥ing 20 T34 or what ever god knows more tanks they can bring i mean COME ON i cant even enjoy myself when i play this.  PLS nerf all the allies or at least buff the Axis forces and whyle were here you could at leats create one more axis faction like Japan or Italy.  P.S - BALANCE YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING GAME BALANCED SEGA OR WHOEVER MADE THIS.",

Nazi end game is airstrikes that kill all your unit's in a good emplaced area, even if you have the allied anti air soviets was garbage so gg, but up till that it's fun an somewhat balanced..  another terrible feature is leaving match's because your teamates are unbearably stupid. watching you die, basically leaving you to face two active player's it seem's like almost 50/50 with those guy's... thanks for the good time's but your game is unbalanced an match making favor's nazi's for some reason. i rarely see two nazi's not working together or in sync... it's funny becausei like 1v2's where ii'm outnumbered but it's not funny anymore. seya.",

I could not make the game look any worse unless I ran it at 800x600 or something, and I still struggle to get about 20 frames, and in big battles I'm often at least 30-60 seconds behind all the other players because of the lag. Most recent game I played the game would freeze for about a second every 3 seconds, and my commands were being recognized by my troops 10 seconds or so after I sent them.  Extremely poor optimization despite being a fun game. I can run Ark: Survival Evolved 30+fps on high settings and yet this game is completely unplayable.",
