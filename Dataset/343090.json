    "description": "I am excited to release my first game on Steam! SimpleRockets was released in 2013 for mobile and I've put a ton of work into it to get it ready for PC and Mac. It was inspired by KSP, and it offers a simpler 2D experience for building rockets and exploring space with realistic orbital mechanics.",

            "review_text": "Kerbal space program in a single plane. It's still rocket science, but everything is a lot easier when you only have x-y. I would strongly recommend this over KSP for kids. And if you enjoy KSP, this is a good companion - it has more of an arcadey fun feel to KSP's realism.",

In addition, SimpleRockets is tiny, and it loads and plays like greased lightning even on my potato of a rig.  Verdict: two rockets up (oh myyyy)!",

The controls, maps, and building are all a bit awkward, and dont act exactly how they should. Its really just an IOS game, and it would be kind of fun to play on the bus on your phone.  That being said this game has potential, its not a bad game in anyway. I really only see it as being worth $3-5 for whats in it current, and what you get compared to KSP.",
