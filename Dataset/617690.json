    "description": "Endless Winter is a slightly difficult clearance game. Players control the cars passing through varied terrains and mechanisms, and breaking through the obstacles setting up by robots. Our story happens in a cold future world which experienced the war between humans and artificial intelligence. You can explore the wasteland as a courier.",
