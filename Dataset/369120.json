There are some easter eggs in the dialogues which will be recognized by folks who are into conspiracy theories :)  The music goes from nice atmospheric to quite rough &amp; industrial at places. The volume level could be adjusted so that all music matches, but maybe that's just me.  I'll need to see how it all ties in with the other parts. The one freebie novel which is also on Steam seems to be happening in some time after the events of this one I believe.",
