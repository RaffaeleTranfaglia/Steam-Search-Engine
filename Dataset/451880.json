            "review_text": "As the song goes, 'Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, save it for a rainy day' or in your case: save stars in your basket.   Catch a Falling Star is just as the description says. It is very relaxing, beautiful and soothing, perfect for someone who wants to play without thinking too much. Which was how I felt when I picked up this game. Not only is this game adorable and colourful, but it is also very fun and at times quite challenging and exciting.   The gameplay is very simple; Using A and D or your left and right arrow keys, collect the falling stars in your basket while avoiding ice that slows you down. As you are stocking up stars, you have to watch the wind direction and strength as the wind will push your stars around in the air. After filling your basket up, you need to deposit your stars on either side of the screen to gain points. On your journey, you can collect not only stars and ice, but also different coloured power orbs that will either power you up or down. They can either make or break your game. They can boost you by giving your basket some extra speed or stop the wind completely. Other orbs will handicap you by making it hail more ice shards, slow down your basket considerably or have the wind go mental on you. While playing you will collect “star coins”, which help make your gameplay a bit more enjoyable. You can buy one-time use power-ups; give your basket increased star capacity or a shield for ice protection. You can also unlock additional basket designs and background themes with individual music to customize your gaming experience and make it more personal. After a while, the game might get a bit boring and tedious, especially if you are going for 100% of the achievements. However, it was not the case for me, as I really enjoy this kind of casual game.  Climb the leader board on the quest for the number one spot as the ultimate star lord or casually sweep the ground for some extra star coins to spend. For the price, it is definitely worth the money. You will get some good hours of fun out of it, especially if you are half-bad at it and you want to 100% it. I enjoyed every moment and I do not regret my time spent as a star collector. So make a wish and catch them all.",

I guess if you care about posting a high score on steam than it might be worth paying for. Otherwise I suggest just playing the dozens of free versions of collecting falling items that exist.  The graphics are nice at least.",

With many options for backgrounds, whether it be the night sky or cherry blossom trees, and many options for basket styles, including a tea cup and purse, as well as many power-up options, the game offers a great variety of settings.  The soundtrack adds to the peaceful, relaxing atmosphere of the game, and offers a comfortable, late-night experience for all to enjoy!",
