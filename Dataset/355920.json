            "review_text": "And another game played from the Pixel Puzzles Franchise. Not much different from  Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime  except the pictures. A little difference comes in place when you want to get some help solving the puzzles. There are rocket parts floating around. You decide to put them together to build a rocket, or use them to get hints about orientation or position of a puzzle piece.  I really like, that it had achievements for solving every puzzle without using the rocket pieces to get hints. They were not too hard to solve, the biggest with 350 pieces took me around 3 hours. The smaller one with 60 pieces only 10-15 minutes.  I didn't like a bug at puzzles with 220+ pieces, where pieces at the edge of the puzzle board dropped below the board, if they were not in the correct spot. Often you either had to pick them up instantly, or you have to shuffle the floating pieces by pressing the 'S'-key, because they were stuck under the board.  I was glad to not have a similar minigame as we had it with the Undead-Puzzle.  8/10, recommended for every jigsaw fan",

            "review_text": "Another puzzle game from Decaying Logic this time in space. Puzzle sizes range from 60 to 350. Beautiful images from space including nebulas, space walks, planets and more. Instead of just doing puzzles, you can also build rockets that when completed will launch into space. In order to put the puzzle pieces in their right place you must rotate them. The music fits the whole space theme of the game. A great way to relax and enjoy a casual game. 10/10.",

            "review_text": "There are a couple of variations compared to how I lay classical puzzles that it kills the whole idea for me  - No fusing segments together, so you can't make the big things off the board and drag it as a whole to where it should roughly fit. - Auto-fitting and not being able to pick the pieces up anymore if they're in the correct spot. Auto-fit on everything even if it's not correct and allowing you to pick them up again would be much nicer, or just make it tighter so it doesn't autofit nearly as fast. Note that this is also prone to going trial-and-error through the puzzle. I'd really like to be able to disable that so that I don't accidentally complete pieces I didn't intend to or had settled on yet",
