Think of Serena as an interactive story: you need to click on things to collect info and, piece after piece, you'll begin to understand what's going on. If you enjoy reading and investigating, just download it. Otherwise, don't.  For the ones interested, this is what is going to happen: Serena will take about one hour of your time and you'll  probably  leave the finished game thinking: 'Well? Is this all? It's so obvious that things went THAT way...'  Then, you'll go back to your life.  Later on, you will remember one small detail and think: 'But if things went THAT way, how should I explain... this?' Another detail will haunt you. And another one will follow.   At this point, you'll realize there was much more depth in this  free  yet precious gem than what you first assumed, so you'll feel compelled to start all over and try to make ALL the pieces fit together.  At least, this is exactly what happened to me.  Serena is a wonderful gift to the community and I really recommend downloading it.",

While the gameplay itself isn't anything special, it's the story that keeps the game going. It starts out as sort of a love story of a young couple but the further you progress and the more memories you regain, the clearer your mind gets and faces you with the sad truth of what your relationship with your beloved wife has become.  I don't want to spoil anything of the story, but it's an intense emotional rollercoaster ride throughout the ~1 hour of playtime and if you're looking for a relaxing game that tells both a sweet and sad story, make sure to check the game out.  It's free!",

Pros: Great ambience and music. Wonderful design of the cabin to fit the *I'm assuming* desired feel. The female voice actor did her job well. The animations while few were well designed for the story. And oh god the plot twist...  Cons: The damn main voice actor reads his lines as if being teleprompted at 6am with not a damn in the world. Probably cuz he did it for free. He just didn't fit with the rest of the projects paticularly somber mood. His highlights were when he was angry and even that was bordering on dull. Aside from that, the repeating of dialouge after exhausting memories was a bit annoying, the cursor was bordering on non-intuitive, and...   Like I said, for free its worth the 1 hour acknowledgement of a decent piece of digital artwork. If they asked for money, I'd say pass it up. It tried hard, it really did; but it missed its mark somewhere and I'm guessing its because of its main actor and frustrating mouse interface.",

It's point and click, so no free roaming around, but I don't think it takes away from the atmosphere of it, and the voice naration is really good. Which adds to the story a lot. To get the atmosphere they did with point and click, music adn voice acting was really imporessive. It's not an extremely long game, but I reallly think people who are fans of mystery, what I am going to call horror light, and point and click are really going to like this game.

I will definitely be waiting for similar games, I adore point and click and this was done really well. The ability to right click and change the browsing speed was really helpful.   SPOILER COMING UP  I would have liked to have the ability to discover more right before the fire, like multiple endings where you draw differenct conclusions about the body.

There is no start menu! You can't really 'start' a game without clicking any start button, can you? :P *kidding* (You probably could change some of the game's settings through editing a lua script.

I found it extremely predictable personally.  There isn't much 'game' to this game. You just click and hear a little voice over, which honestly is fine if done well and cleverly. But this had a fairly predictable story and it was more like 'I know what's going on so hurry up, I know this is going to happen, so happen already!'  There's nothing wrong IMO with interactive storytelling, but if you compare this to say, Gone Home, the quality in story telling is just so different. In Gone Home, you explore a house and find stuff and eventually piece together a story. In Serena, you're in a one room cabin, and you have you click on things in a certain order to get the story.   For example, you might want to open something and it'll say 'No, I don't want to open it yet! I just don't feel like it. Maybe later.' That just feels so contrived, especially when you know something important is inside. So then you walk around the room clicking on things over and over many times the same thing. Then go back and see if you feel like opening the various things now. No? 'I'll open it later, I just don't feel like it now.' Fine. Click other things again. Click click. Try again.

Fortunately, the tedium of this object-response structure is lessened by the setting's dynamism and  abundant easter eggs. Somber music and gradually-dimming lighting create an otherwise immersive atmosphere. The voice acting âwhile not particularly compellingâ brings credibility to Serena's character and accentuates the narrator's development.

I've followed this game from Jan Kavan's profile (a man who is largely responsible for the JULIA:Among the Stars story and music), being curious about this project. I was impressed by 'JULIA' project and I was expecting to see something great here. Sadly, the music is one of the best things about this so-called 'game'. Art is good too, but nothing extremely special about it (combined with a small amount). Texts are good too, but htose text do not have enough fuel to bring enoug fire into that game. Some easter-eggs look out of place, by the way. The last thing I needed there was a Space Quest reference.  The very idea is just great. The 'personal limbo\\hell' is an interesting thing to eleborate on, no doubt. But the way it's peresented here - it's too raw and unpolished. I mean...I've experienced 'Silent Hill 2', and 'Serena' is just a pale echo of what the former game had to offer. Non-obvious progression logic might also be unnoying at some point.   Pros - it's free , and it's a nice example of a 'non-typical' game. I guess I'd have been much more angrier had I payed my money for that. Wish they had bigger budget and the game itself were of a bigger scale. It's short.   Cons - it's extremely raw, unpolished and unfinished. It has the idea, but not the ways to express it.

Serena is quite a unique adventure, and although short, I believe it's one of the best stories I've seen in a game before. The fact that the game evolves, that things changes around you while walking around the room gives an impression of madness, and is superbly well done. The atmospheric music is beautiful and draws you further into the characters feelings, while the filter grain, lack of colors and disturbing paintings added to the eerie setting of the game.  There are a few ameliorations that could have been done gameplay wise to create even more immersion, like story branching, a couple of puzzles or maybe just a small inventory system, but maybe this would have caused the game to be less 'artsy' and a bit more of a game, which was not the point.

If you are not super familar nor versed in these types this is a great game to get you into the genre!  The one down side to this game i'd say is the length: it's short.

But it will be diffrent for everyone.   All in all, go try it. For a short, fun, free game you don't have much to lose.

Some say the graphics are 'okay', but personally I find the textures and everything to be absolutely gorgeous, very realistic, if not better than real life..very easy to get the feel of an old, dark, dirty cabin filled with a lifetime of stories and events; it's been truly lived in. As for music and sounds..very clear, for one...while music itself is not a constant thing, it plays out in many important parts, giving serious hints to changes in the plot..very tense, enough to rile you up and wonder what's going to happen next.  For the story...Well, I wont give any spoilers away, because honestly you MUST experience this for yourself to truly understand just how dark and yet beautiful this game is. It took me 70 minutes to complete and it was WORTH IT. This is a story, this is a game, a visual novel..whatever you wish to call it, it is an EXPERIENCE and you are living through the eyes of the protagonist. The voice acting really captures the emotions of the characters...you really feel what they're feeling. For some, it may seem repetitive..to get through the game, you must travel all of the cabin and click each object multiple times to uncover the past about the character and the relationship he had with his wife Serena. For a bit it may seem like you're stuck but as you go through things, you realize that what the protagonist describes slowly changes..he describes more and more..things develop much more deeply and twist and turn in ways you would never expect.  My fiance and I played/watched this game, listening to every detail...we got roped into the emotion of the protagonist, dying to know what happened to Serena, what was going on in this cabin, in this guy's head...and as everything changed from sadness and wonder to..other things..we were in complete shock over and over. The ending is something you will never see coming. You will have many assumptions and if you get invested with the story, you will feel the panic and confusion the story depicts...but the ending...  Even on the forums, people are discussing what the ending could be or mean 100%.... Listen to me, developers of Serena: When someone makes a show/movie, game, book, or anything else, and there are loose ends, or multiple interpretations...when there is a community around a story and people are consistently trying to analyze it and make theories...You KNOW you made something amazing, something that will stay alive for as long as it's talked about. Even when the majority understands the ending, the sheer beauty, darkness, and emotion of this game will be more than enough to rope in other people who have yet to experience it.",

His wife left him at some point and he tries to find out exactly what happened and why she would leave. It gets to the point where he wonders if all his memories are just figments of a dream. It plays on the psychological aspect of mystery to where there is no actual danger, but your mind can actually start to panic. I actually started to panic along with the character slightly with how intense the story was getting.  Itâs a very simple game when you talk in terms of gameplay, just point and click to get into the different items around you or to move around the cabin. Now as you play, you have to click on pretty much everything or else you may not get to the next part of the story, a thing I was trying to figure out and almost didnât finish the story without looking at a walkthrough. It is real easy to get stuck if you donât try every little thing and you might have to click on things more then once. There are also audio cues as well you have to listen for as well. So many little things can make the game play a nightmare when stuck.   The textures are very dark and dirty, making it feel slightly like a horror game. There are dark pictures around the cabin that are slightly hard to see but it feels like itâs a very old place. The texture work makes everything very realistic, almost too much texture in some areas, but you can tell something is slightly off. I donât really get it but its like the lines around everything is a little to crisp and clean to be real.   The voice acting and the music is rather gentle and fits with the whole style of the game. The sad man speaking and narrating his story fits with the sad almost non existent sound. This is really a quiet game. You get music only minimally leaving the haunting impression that makes this game an interesting game to play through.  It is short, sweet and even though sometimes hard to play for a first timer (as sometimes I could not find what would set the next section off) it was a nice short game. Itâs free to play on steam right now.",

Granted it was difficult to figure out what to do at times but the main part of the game is 98% clicking around so I can't complain when that is the very purpose although there are hints (When looking at a particular point in the game the character goes 'There's more interesting things, like my books' Which directed me to the bookcase and the next step)  What I can say is that the game is good. It offeres a bit of openendedness to the details of the final end but one of the things I rather enjoy was that with both endings the game changed. The first time when I ended up breezing through it he was sad at the realization of what could have been with Serena and the pain of knowing hope was no longer there. The second time he was full of anger, almost HOW DARE SHE type, as if in denial or attempting to blame what was no longer there on her.  All in all a decent game, one that I think could be expanded on but decent.",

All that out of the way, the way the story progression worked was a little confusing at first. Once I realized it was a flag sort of thing, it made it a little easier. The story itself got a little predictable toward the end, and then left me confused with the finale.  Also, the player character's voice gets slightly monotonous.  Would I recommend this for MOST people? No. If you're bored and have an hour to kill, it's an interesting game and there's no doubt some work went into it. Perhaps it just wasn't up my alley.",

The game looks good and is backet up with some very good music and sound design, through a problem comes with the voice acting which i will go more into with the negatives and overall the plot was interesting.  Ok with that done lets look at the negatives well the voice acting its starded off ok but as i went into the later half of the game it went down hill the emotions of the main character were over the top and borderline ridiculous and this was not hleped by the repeated dialogue when trying to find the next item to click on (though I will admit that may be due to my lack of skill wen it comes to point &amp; click) this was highlighted by the repeating of one phrase that i ill not spoil for you but it got on my nerves and by that nature just made the character annoying.  Overall I think the game is trying to be more then it is with weak dialogue and clunky gameplay although it has got an interesting polt. If you are looking for a game to fill an 1h then its may do the job, but if you are looking for a game that will changer your outlook or something like that this may not be the game you are looking for.

Also, while I don't really like the writing or handling of it, the premise of the game has potential, and the first part of the game is actually pretty good.   Now, onto the bad: The writing is what kills the game. The pacing is too slow in the beginning, and too fast in the end (which leaves the characters with very little depth), and the 'twist' you find at the end is something you'll guess as soon as you start exploring. The atmosphere is ruined by things like the silly book titles and the narrator's dialougue going from a melodramatic plea to remember to him casually speaking when you run through dialougue options. And then the ending. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who's considering playing the game, so let's just say that the graphics and voice acting take a considerable drop in quality, any themes or atmosphere created in the last thirty minutes are ruined, and the last shot is a cliche that will leave you groaning.   I really hate to be so critical to a game that was free, but I was really surprised by it after I read so many positive reviews. Overall, I'd say it's a game that will cost you nothing but your time to play it, so if you're really desperate to kill an hour (or you don't mind a bad story if there's good graphics or sounds), go ahead, but otherwise, I'd just find something else.",

SPOILER FOR THE MORAL OF THE STORY: The main reason to play this game is to learn from the letters that Serena has created. This guy was intelligent, but he could not see signs of a very emotional woman who seeked change. She would not have written letters if she hated her husband throughout the entire relationship. Deep emotions were put onto those letters and my guess was he behaved like a stubborn child who will not leave an action park and ignored them.

A playthrough of it lasts only an hour, but within that hour, the game took me through numerous plot twists, an emotional rollercoaster, and did not cease to peak my curiosity. It got to the point where I even cried a few times. Eveything was just so well done, not to mention original. Add numerous interpretations of the plot to the mix, and you have yourself a masterpiece.  This is one of the best adventure games of all time, as well as now one of my favorite games of all time.

Just know every 5 minutes after the initial 'reality pimp-slap' you'll say to yourself, 'WTF?!' and 'woah,...that's deep.' I recommend this to anyone who enjoys suspense with not too much of the horror factor and/or enjoys stories that are dark or filled with desparation. I give this game a 10/10 simply because although it's a short game, it left nothing unexplained and gives you plenty of clues as to what exactly happened to Serena. The atmosphere is what gave this game the feel that the players needed to be immersed into the game with pretty decent graphics. Do yourself a favor and download it now.",

If you're looking for a challenge, or for choices to influence how the story ends, then I'm not going to lie: you'll probably find this is a waste of your time. But, as an interactive and immersive experience of a story, I can highly recommend it. I even basically saw big reveal coming, a way before it actually came, but it didn't lessen the impact.

The over all feel is somber, I felt for the guy, even if my theories did change a few times throughout it. I -was- surprised with how it ended - kudos to that!
