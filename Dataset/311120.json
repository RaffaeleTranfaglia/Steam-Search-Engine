I do still recommend it, but not over the original.  Again, to fix the music = crash issue(s), you can take the audiere.dll from the Metro2 fix on the developer's website and put into game files.",

But the major ingame bugs are still a problem. It was too short (shorter than first game). The concept was still neat but the game is not acceptable. Luckily it is really cheap (and cheaper than first game) and is always on sale. 5.5/10 would skip!",

            "review_text": "Either you liked or did not liked the 1st game (I liked it, despite it´s problems), I advice you to not buy this one. It was way shorter than the 1st one and the story is an ununderstandable mess. The performance was awfull and there were crashes all the time - for the 1st game, there is a fix online to improve it´s performance, but there is no fix for this one.  Even on 'easy', it appears I am playing on 'very hard' (and there is no 'very hard' difficulty). The enemy AI aimbots - a problem that existed in the last game, but in this one, it is even one bigger problem - the fact that you cannot lean in this game is what makes you die and die a lot of times, so the most important way to win the game is to Fast Save almost all the time after a firefight (F5 key). Also, why isn´t the music enabled when you play for the 1st time, forcing the player to enable it? Despite that, both the menu music and the in-game music are trash compared to the 1st game.  When we look at both of this games, we see again the dialectics in motion, according to Marxist theory, which Stalin himself wrote about ('Dialectical and Historical Materialism'). Stalin Subway is the thesis and Stalin Subway: The Red Veil is the anthesis - but will we have a synthesis? Only time will tell, but me liking the 1st game, I think we need a 'Stalin Subway 3' (or a remake) to restore greatness to the series and fix the problems from the 2 games.  In conclusion: do not buy it, even on special sale period. Just get the 1st one.  ",
