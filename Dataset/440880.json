            "review_text": "I'm going to give this game a recommendation, but with a warning that it may not be for everyone. It only takes about 5 hours to complete, maybe an hour more if you want to unlock all of the achievements, and you will see about 95% of what the game has to offer in only one playthrough. The room puzzles are fairly simplistic - they consist of block/lever puzzles, avoiding tiles with traps, and timing your movements over grates that periodically spew fire. There are also a few objects you need to find and bring to another location, but they are all very obvious solutions. The controls are adequate for completing the tasks, but movement is slow, and overall a little clunky.  Thankfully, the game compensates for these shortcomings with a nice little story (think Wizard of Oz but more demented), and a cast of characters that manage to be both horrifying and charming at the same time. The pixel art cut-scenes are lovely, and the baroque music is very evocative, although it would be nice if there was more of it. I strongly suggest  not  watching the videos or looking at the screenshots, as they give away many of the most pleasant surprises.  This game is being over-shadowed at the moment by lengthier indie games with more content, but I do hope it finds its audience eventually. It was compelling enough that I did play through to the end, which is becoming something of a rarity as my Steam library has grown to a ridiculous size.",

            "review_text": "  TL;DR:   4.5/5. A great game for pixel horror enthusiasts that are looking for a fresh take on the genre as well as newcomers. Contains a well-balanced combo of scares and fun. The descriptors are correct in saying LoZ fans will appreciate it.   An impressive take on the gothic, The Count Lucanor tests the limits of its genre, offering a unique and at times frightening atmosphere while retaining the fun, humor and challenge of a pixel game. Cutscenes throughout the game show impressive dedication and are visually captivating in spite of the simplistic medium. While not the challenging aspect, the game's puzzles require a certain degree of patience and willingness to explore - many important clues and items are easily missed. The Count Lucanor allows players to make helpful and harmful decisions right off the bat, and its vast array of choices and outcomes make for a game with much potential for replay. Adoption of a unique saving format and sincere effort to create suspense and unease without use of cheap scares adds a defining type of challenge and enjoyment, setting it apart from many other games of its kind. The loss of a half star for this game lies in some minor bugs and the rare crash - the game does however make up for this with a Safe Mode that can be activated on boot. Additionally, the fluidity of the game's plot can at times be hampered by the dropping of some heavy-handed hints and somewhat forced symbolism, making it more 'show-and-tell' than mystery.",

            "review_text": "Already played Undertale? Then play the second best game I've played in a really long time. This one. The Count Lucanor delivers on its promises of having your choices matter. It's got multiple endings, so unless you use a guide and knock them all out in one playthrough *cough* you'll have plenty of replay value here. Even then, there's more than one solution to some problems.  The writing in this game is top notch. I love the characters. I haven't read the story this is based on, cause it's from like 1899 and I'd never heard of it til I played this game, but you shouldn't go looking it up until after you've beaten the game for blatant spoiler reasons. So I dunno how well it sticks to the source material. But I don't really care, either.  In terms of graphics, it's got that whole old school video game vibe going for it, with some pretty portraits and beautiful cutscenes tossed in. If you're bothered by retro graphics then you probably didn't play Undertale either, and you and I just don't have much to talk about. Why are you even reading this? Go back to your shiny new age games, if you can't handle a few pixels.  The music's alright. Fit's the vibe, can be quite creepy at times. I'm not going to be blaring it from my car speakers as I drive to work in the mornings, but it's all well composed and doesn't get too repetative.  The gameplay is one of this game's strongpoints. It may look like a point and click adventure but I played the whole thing using a controller and never had any issues. The Count Lucanor is a challenging game, but it's not an unfair one. There's a few hard achievements and you're going to die in this game (Hans isn't the fastest on his feet so if you walk in front of certain enemies you'll lose a lot of blood before you can get away) but there's plenty of healing items if you know where to look and only use them when you need to. The puzzles are relatively easy; there's no Siera logic to worry about. Just save every time you think you've accomplished something signifigant and you'll be fine. If you didn't do things a certain way you might get stuck on the game's most direct puzzle, but if you keep at it you'll figure it out eventually. Or you'll give up and look up the answer. I'm not gonna judge you. This is a safe place.  Overall I found this to be a very rewarding experience. It's fun, it's creepy, heck sometimes it's downright scary. I get the feeling I'll be coming back to this one again and again over time, even after I've done a full Let's Play of it. You may develop a fear of livestock from playing this game, and you'd come by it honestly. Give The Count Lucanor a shot and you'll be hooked too. Buy it on sale if you have to, but I bought it at full price (it's cheap) and have no regrets. You don't wanna miss out on this trip down the rabbit hole.",

            "review_text": "The Count Lucanor is a pixelated horror adventure created by Baroque Decay. It's their first game although you wouldn't think it with the overall mood and pixelated graphics cobining to make for one of the most immersive game I've played this year.   The game follows Hans, a young boy who leaves home and his mother behind in search of castles of gold and adventure. As stories go, things do not go as planned and Hans becomes trapped in Count Lucanors castle. A being called Kobold informs that he must pass a series of trials in order to become the new heir to the count's fortune. The first trial, to guess the Kobold's real name. And so the game begins.  You spend your time exploring rooms for letters, avoiding traps/monsters and placing candles to light the dark corners of castle. There're very few characters but they are all well imagined and interesting to talk to so it's not so bad.   The game will take you four-ish hours to finish if you decide to do everything and you more than likely will. It encourages replayability and I found myself playing parts over again to get achievements simply because they added that bit more to the story. Also there are five different endings in total.  Overall the music is great and the sound quality is relatively good. Noting I can say bad about this game.  If you like Zelda or rpg horror games like Ib you will definitely enjoy this.",

No bugs or glitches, everything was polished and ran smoothly. The only issues I have with it is that its kinda really short and that your saves are limited. I finished it really quick and grabbed up a few of the extra endings from a single save in under a few hours and its not that you really need an unlimited amount of saves, but it kind of feels pressuring to know you only have so many. The limited saves really shouldnt cause too many issues though. I think I could have finished it quicker if I didn't keep purposely killing myself.   You play as young hans, a not so humble brat that wants to be rich. He leaves his mother on his 10th birthday in search of adventure. Things start out fairly normal and RPGish until night falls. Then things get really creepy, really fast.   The story, game, and creepiness get a 5/5 However, with the length of the game compared to its cost, its brought down to a 4/5 There's more meaty games out there for the same price.",
