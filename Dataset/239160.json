            "review_text": "This game is not epic, it will not stay forever carved in your memory and it probably won't be on any GOTY lists at the end of the year... but it certainly isn't a mediocre game like some critics would make you think, it's quite enjoyable if you don't expect it to be something it's not (Dishonored would be the first thing that comes to mind). Thief is meant to be played stealthily and if you play it differently, you won't have a good time with it (and believe me, I tried).  So the positives and the negatives... let's start with the bad things shall we?  - Horrible optimization on some systems, while it works great on others (I was one of the unlucky ones and had to play the game with the textures set to very low or else my game would freeze every 10 seconds). - This game's 'open world' harms it more than it does it good. It's very tedious trying to get to your quest marker, as you will constantly run into walls that aren't there on the map. - The story is not engaging, you will probably forget it easily. - There is something crazy going on with the game's sound, you will constantly hear people talking even though there is no one around you (maybe Eidos wanted Garrett to have some super hearing power, I really don't know).  the positives:  + Really, really, really fun gameplay (as long as you like stealth games and are playing this game as one). + One of the chapters surprised me by being something totally different from the rest of the game, and it gets props for scaring the cr@p out of me. + The game's atmosphere, the world and it's inhabitants are dark and that fits this game like a glove.  The game has more negatives than positives in my humble opinion, but the negatives aren't really that bad, except the game's optimization, but that issue isn't there for everyone, and it will hopefully get patched soon. Overall Thief was an enjoyable experience, and it gets a 7/10 from me.",

            "review_text": "I finished Thief as the sun set, left my apartment for a walk to stretch my plague shrivelled toes. Emerging from that dark world, I reflected on the deceit of Orion, the moral quandries of our nobal thief, the cries of terror and hollow moans of a city squeezed by the plague, and the stench of rats and fecal matter in the streets. I eyed the windows I passed, assessing each based on ease of entry and likelihood of occupants, unconciously feeling for the crowbar at my hip.   Total play-time: 18 hours.  Thief is set in a dark world, bridging stealth gameplay with linear horror elements. The ambience was great, once you get into it. Sad to say the first 10 hours of gameplay was spread out over a number of months, as I just couldn't really get into it very quickly.  Gameplay: 5/10 The controls are all over the map. And the map is a murky labyrinth at best. I almost quit playing because I couldn't figure out how to drop off a dangling rope. Turns out there is a seperate key for that. Once I became comfortable with it the game became much more enjoyable, but it takes a while.  A/V: 8/10 Ambiance, thy name is Thief. Excellent enivronments, albeit slightly linear, but that's ok because not every game released these days is obligated to be open-world survival. The architecture and attention to detail was great. The background noises and sounds drifting through the city were haunting. The music got old after a while, so I turned it off and was still immersed by the sounds of the city.  Dialogue/Storyline: 5/10 The dialogue was sub-par, but the overall storyline was quite interesting. Nothing is really explained in detail as most of the characters don't mince words much, so there are some intuitive leaps in the story. Most of your journey will take place alone in the dark, if you're not prepared for that then go play Nekopara or something. You really get a sense of stoic pessimism from most of the characters that sits quite naturally in their bleak world.  Overall: 18/30 I love horror games, and I do enjoy stealth, so this one was uniquely catered to my tastes. That being said I can't recommend it for everyone. If you do give it a shot, give it some time, keep it on the backburner as it moves pretty slow at times.",

            "review_text": "Let me first say I'm recommending it, but only just. In terms of the Thief series, this game doesn't hold up quite the same. Your freedom in traversal isn't plentiful, you will have more than a single path to get through areas, but these more or less come down to simply what the dev has provided in terms of following a path you have selected to its end, you will have options, but not quite open freedom. Do you like to jump? Forget that with this game, the only ascent in any form is achieved by climbing things, and you are only able to climb onto objects which the devs have allowed you to.  The difficulty options are nice, in that you get to customise them more to your liking. It has the typical easy, normal, hard, etc, but on top of that, there is a custom setting where you can turn on/off various other things. This includes the infamous perma-death setting (applies to being caught, seeing as this is a stealth game), no upgrades, no kills or knockouts, no manual saves, slower movement, more expensive items from sellers, and a few others. Personally, I'm doing my first playthrough using the highest difficulty, with all these settings turned on except for the perma-death and no manual saves.  A little nuisance, however, is also something that might just bother completionists, as it is impossible to get 100% on the hardest difficulty. This is because certain difficulty settings make it impossible to complete certain objectives in various missions. Just recently I have completed a mission where I did everything perfect from a stealth standpoint, found all loot, never spotted, never harmed an enemy in any way, and so on. But you couldn't count it as 100%, the reason being... one of these objectives was having exactly 1 kill or knockout, which is impossible with my difficulty settings.  Ignoring the previous entries in the series, it is a pretty decent game, I find myself mostly using it to kill time, though being a stealth fanatic, I can get caught into fairly lengthy sessions despite its flaws. It can still be fun, provided you're a fan of stealth, to just get by without being caught while stealing everything, that is available, in sight.  In terms of performance, it seems well-made for PCs. The only issue in terms of framerate I've encountered being during pre-rendered cut-scenes, where it was noticeably choppy, but otherwise, the game runs smoothly for me with the highest settings. The general appearance of things can also be admired, considering what they were aiming for, seeing as the scenery in this game doesn't necessarily pass for 'pretty.'  I managed to get this game for $37 before release. I'm not exactly unhappy with that amount, but to those of you looking to purchase, I'd have to say it's more worth your money to buy it in the $20-30 range.",

            "review_text": "Good but could be better. Ai is kinda stupid, loading between areas can be frustrating, controls and platforming can be a little akward at times. What holds the game up is good stealth mechanics, story and atmosphere, graphics, looting is a lot of fun, pick-pocketing can be really satisfiying, and there are tons side missions.   Game allows you to play with 3 different styles; predator, ghost and opportunist. Predator is just killing everyone who dares to stop you, ghots is completing the quest without being seen and leaving no trace, opportunist... well I couldn't figure that out actually. It's about using the enviroment to your advantage or something.  Ai is just stupid. Predictable, blind idiots with memory of a fish. They still can see the little differences you made and react to them. They can look for corners, covers and closets and find you.  Story is cool and captivating enough to see you till the end. There are good cutscenes and tons of lore in the world.  My biggeest issue is the loading screens in every 5 minutes. This game is supposed to be an openworld game. This was unnacceptable for me. But even with that I managed to suffer though it because looting is really satisfiying.  I recommend this game, but only to people who love the genre, people with patientce and nerve.",

Then you warm up to the game, starting to appreciate the reboot's new direction. Then you start to enjoy yourself, getting into the meat of the level designs and AI quirks. And then you facepalm, repeatedly, non-stop, forever, as the story erodes every last shred of goodwill, with cheese-bursting cutscenes about ghostly energy and Primals and megalomaniacal siblings unleashing cult members to change the world.   They could have scrapped the hub town, deleted the story, and just made ~10 large intricate sneaking levels, saving production money, and everything would have been fine, even without Garrett's old voice.   As a game, Thief is competent, even beautiful, and its apparent many people worked hard on it. Buy it on sale and get lost for a few weekends.   As a Thief branded game, its a disappointing mess, discarding old characters and methods for misguided AAA marketing ideas and can only be recommended for rubbernecking at the train wreck.

            "review_text": "This is a tough recommendation to make. Thief is an interesting enough reboot of the classic franchise, but it can't be compared to the older games as it's a much less open game. That being said, the levels are pretty large by modern standards, and there's plenty of ways to tackle each situation. Stealth is your best option, as combat is (intentionally) difficult. You're no super hero or anything here.  Eight story missions (outside of the prologue) doesn't sound like much, but it'll last you a good 10 hours - more if you go for all the side quests and try to loot everything (there's a LOT of stuff to steal - this IS a Thief game after all). Theft is your only source of income, though there's not much to spend it on other than skill points - which you don't NEED to finish the game, and are available for free at certain points.  Thief is surprisingly demanding on your hardware for a game originally designed for almost ten-year old hardware (Xbox 360/Playstation 3). I can run most things pretty well, but even with most options set to low, I had a few performance issues. Perhaps not a well-optimised port? In any case, I managed a reasonable framerate throughout, and rarely came across any particularly bad bugs - a few clipping issues and ragdoll glitches mostly.  Is Thief a good game? Yes. Is there room for improvement? Definitely. Some of the levels aren't designed particularly well, and a lot require you to go down a set path to get through undetected. I'll give the game credit for actually making me think about my approach - a rarity in today's age of hand-holding, corridor-like gameplay.  My biggest complaint is the jumping mechanics - the jump button serves a few other functions as well, such as climbing. This leads to Garrett jumping down pits to his death instead of across to another ledge. It gets very frustrating and ruins the fun. There's plenty of other keys available - why can't I map climb and jump to seperate keys?  Anyway, if you can get past a few poor design choices and a story that goes off the rails towards the end, I'd recommend picking this one up. I enjoyed it while it lasted, for the most part.",

If you love games like Skyrim and will spend hours of your time in games looting bodies then Thief is definitely for you.   The graphics were absolutely stunning and I rarely found myself lagging or having problems with my computer playing the game. 11/10 for graphics for sure.  I really enjoyed a lot of the gameplay throughout this game. I found it to be challenging and tricky enough to keep me on my toes and using my brain and I wasn't ever bored. The storyline is where I have my issues with this game. I found it slightly confusing and felt as if the developers went way too far into the vagueness rather than spelling it out for the players. Maybe im just thick skulled and didn't catch on fast enough but towards the end I found myself more confused than anything. The ending was not as great as I would have expected and left me a little puzzled.

            "review_text": "Thief (2014) is a 'reboot' of the Thief franchise...&amp; maybe could be considered a true-blue sequel to Thief: Deadly Shadows (Thief: DS). Thief (2014) feels like a sequel to Thief: DS, since this game takes place (again) in a somewhat open-world called The City for 'The Master Thief' Garrett (the player) to explore + b/c this feels much more modern than the previous game. Also, some references also seem like a continuation to Thief: DS. Just like Thief: DS, there are main missions + side missions for him to take on, as well - which are often excellent, with numerous stealthy ways + directions to choose, in a mission (especially main ones). Also, Garrett can also just explore The City to enter people's houses + shops to rob them!  Garrett meets up with an old friend named Erin, for whom he was a mentor to. She has been greedy, trying to find a certain object, which could make her ultra-powerful + ultra-rich. Erin disappears after an incident + Garrett awakens quite a while later. A disease called The Gloom is spreading + an over-powerful figure has taken The City by storm, imposing his will on this now poverty-stricked + disease-ridden City. This part sounds very similar to another [excellent] stealth game Dishonored (in which that game took a lot of cues from the older Thief games). There is also a resistance building-up against this person, as well - which again, sounds right out of Dishonored's book. Garrett begins taking jobs again to make money + to gain information on Erin's where-abouts.  There's an interesting dynamic that goes on b/t Garrett + Erin, which I wish was further explored here. Garrett usually knocks people out, steals stuff &amp; moves along. Of course, the player can also play deadly, if they actually feel like it &amp; choose to do so (or not). Meanwhile, Erin's turned into the complete opposite of Garrett - willing to kill to get what she wants, without hesitation. Early on, this stuff is excellent. I do wish this was emphasized + explored a bit more, though.  I do wish certain story elements + characters were explored quite a bit further here + a bit more fleshed-out; &amp; that certain events went a different direction - instead of sometimes taking the predictable or under-developered route. This stuff is seems to be one of the few weaknesses I've seen to find with this game.  Eidos Montreal has tried like hell to make this game appeal to both the hardcore, old-school Thief fans + for the modern gamer. Besides your typical difficulty levels that games usually allow the gamer to select, players can impose a Custom Difficulty Mode. Here, the gamer can decide what features they can turn off. A lot of these features that can be disabled (or left enabled) - they are the features modernizing the game. These can range from Disabling One-Hit Takedowns, Game Fails When You Are Seen, Disable Focus Mode, Disabling Shimmering Objects &amp; numerous other things. Personally, on my first run-through - I played on Thief difficulty mode. More games should take this excellent approach of allowing such a deep customization of your difficulty + settings - which flat-out embarrasses most games that basically only have a few difficulty modes.  Like Hitman: Absolution, there is a new X-Ray mode (which is similar to the Batman: Arkham games) called Focus Mode. Garrett can basically see through walls + see enemies. It goes further than that, also. Garrett can even slow-down time, be faster in this mode, do lethal blows &amp; even see important objects be highlighted even more so than normal. A lot of this depends also on your difficulty settings + what skills you upgrade. Depending on what you turn on + off, the game scores the difficulty setting. You're scored in-game, also.  The more Garrett does in the game-world, the more money he can make so he can buy Equipment from merchants &amp; even can purchase Focus Points from a certain someone. Also, Focus Points can even be found in the game-world. This is how Garrett upgrades his skills. Skills can range from making Garrett faster; see more hidden objects in the game-world (&amp; on the map); make him lockpick faster; be more deadly in Focus Mode; his attacks do more damage; upgrade the amount of equipment he can carry; &amp; numerous other things.   Garrett no longer carries a sword - for his main weapon. Garrett only has his blackjack, which by default can make the game played quite a bit more stealthy (as long as you don't level-up down a more action-orientated approach). Getting into fights (especially early on) is not really the best idea, until you've followed Garrett's skills down a certain path. Garrett has his usual assortment of arrows for his bow: regular arrows to hit enemies with; rope arrows so he can climb ropes + reach certain areas; fire arrows to burn objects + enemies; water arrows to put out fires; explosive arrows - to name a few arrows. Also, Garrett has a claw + can climb certain walls w/ it. While a great majority of the game is in 1st-person perspective for the camera + you're seeing through his eyes, when Garrett is platforming on pipes &amp; rappelling down some objects (like Lara Croft would in the Tomb Raider games or Nilin in Remember Me), the game switches to a 3rd-person perspective.  Thief (2014) gets the feel of being 'The Master Thief' better than any other game I've seen. Besides the big things the Thief games always got right, there's also now a lot of subtle + little things that are emphasized big-time here. A new cover system has been added, as well - in which Garrett can glance, lean + look around objects. Garrett can switch from cover-to-cover. A bit similar to Blink Mode from Dishonored, Garrett can perform a 'Swoop' move that moves him very quickly &amp; hard-to-see for a moment - but, its range is very limited. While here you can't move very far + in that supernatural way like Dishonored allowed with Blink Mode - Garrett's 'Swoop' seems like a way to speed-up the gameplay here a bit, making it a bit faster + more action-orientated.  That's not everything on subtlties, either! When putting his hands around paintings, we see Garrett's hands close-up, moving around to try + find the switch to find hidden objects. The same goes for bookshelves, as well - when Garrett's looking for a book that actually might pull a switch to reveal a hidden area. We see Garrett react to objects he finds in the game-world, that might be worth a lot of money. We see (mostly) from the 1st-person perspective, with Garrett opening drawers to cabinets, dressers &amp; other things - moving quick + fast like a Thief would. Garrett has a home-base, in which he stores all of the important things + trophies that he's found, stolen + taken. Not only that - you can look at your stats in-game + even store equipment there, also.  Nixxes has done a good job with making the PC version look technically excellent - which seems like the norm for them, after seeing many of their recent ports for Square Enix + Eidos (Hitman: Absolution, Tomb Raider 2013, Sleeping Dogs, etc). Though, performance was all erratic on DX11 w/ most things on Normal on my PC (i7 950; 1 GB of GF GTX 560 Ti; 8 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit) on its own - ranging from 40 frames to 60 frames per sec at any moment. Locking it down to a 40 frames maximum with EVGA Precision X certainly solved this issue.  If you really liked Thief: DS w/ the direction that game took with gameplay + modernizing the series (when it did), then I'm pretty much preaching to the choir here - play Thief 2014; it does this even more so than Thief: DS. If you weren't happy w/ the direction Thief: DS took [especially when compared to the previous 2 Thief games (Thief: The Dark Project / Gold + Thief II: The Metal Age)] - it's still possible the game might be for the old-school Thief fan b/c of its new Custom Difficulty Mode. After 31 hours w/ my 1st playthrough - Thief (2014) was really good, even despite its few flaws that just rob it from reaching greatness.  Grade = B+.",

First of all: I haven't played the original Thief games, so I don't know what all you series fans did expect or are missing. Playing through the story missions (eight; nine if you count the prologue) took me about 9 1/2h on normal difficulty whereas I consider myself a solid stealth player. I couldn't really follow the story to be honest, I got a rough idea but the flat enactment and missing depth of the characters led to general disinterest. Which is sad as the atmosphere can get quite tense and the world as a whole is nicely set up.  Stealth gameplay works okay, A.I. is bugged sometimes tho. Guards (I've only seen two or three different types during my playthrough btw) should recognize me when I touch them even on normal difficulty, eh? Close combat is rather clunky but handling one or two guards shouldn't pose a problem. Garretts bow is his all-in-one-gear: use it to kill guards, disctract guards, stun guards, blow up guards and also extinguish flames.  You can buy more or less useful additional equipment from merchants which you can rarely find in The City. Inventory management is a pain though, you can't purchase arrows or healing items directly to the storage in your 'residence' and are forced to pay a visit to the merchant every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time you need to restock. Incredibly annoying. Thief also offers a completly redundant skill system which has next-to-no impact on gameplay at all.  Speaking about skill, Nixxes software showed their dedication to create great PC versions of games once more. Thief is very well optimized and ran with a constant 1080p60 on my i5 4570 &amp; HD 7870 with everything except SSAO maxed out. The game can't be considered Crysis 4 or anything but offers great lightning and shadows which is quite essential to such a thiefy game in my opinion. You can really see how consoles held back the game in terms of textures since many of them - including commonly seen as close up like windows and doors - lack detail and could have used a higher resolution. Also, loading times occur too often. They are short still annoying. Whatever, the game looks good and more importantly runs pretty damn well. Also, Mantle and True Audio support are planned for you AMD users out there.  All in all the game is alright - it lacks a solid story and good characters, but offers a nice stealth gameplay expierence in a very tense setting. I wouldn't pay full price for it (got it through an AMD silver code for about 10€) but feel free to grab it at a prince range from 5-10€ if you can live with the aforementioned problems.",

A couple being the hub world is a terrible mess of loading screens and confusing pathways and the bow which seems like an item of paramount importance really doesn't seem to be (while playing I only ever found myself using the water arrows). The story and voice acting is rather plain, but not entirely bad and I would recommend this game only during times of steam sales where I feel the value vs. price is a bit better. 7/10",

Many obstacles are stupid: can not jump over a box or barrel with a little sack or basket over it. Special items are unimaginative and few, collectables are simply useless. Player can carry just one object for distract foes, but other means neither works well. Fighting is dispensable because movements are slow and clumsy, knock out by surprise is noisy even against a asleep target, only can make from backwards and carry the body is more slowly and striking yet. Bow deselects itself without warning. Lighting effects are good, but torchs require an arrow to turn them off, lamps are untouchables, and visual capacities of foes vary a lot; the ones of animals are exagerated.

Thief's time is set to be in both medieval / modern century with electricity and fire with alot of sword play. This game will keep you on your toes most of the time and has an interest in horror.   Characters and AI: You are Garret, the master thief, king of rats. Master of stealth and loves to steal things. Yet you have a heart for the city in which you live in, making your actions duable in the sence that you are the good guy.  Eren: A young woman who partners up with Garret and ♥♥♥♥s everything up in the begining.  AI: The AI are ok and someare scary, never the less they have a specific pattern in which they move and can't seem to see ♥♥♥♥ in the dark unless they are really close.  The game is very detailed to the biggest of buildings to the finest crack in a piece of wood. It looks beautiful. But it's always dark. This game also likes to jump around in the story, linking things from the past to the future, which is really cool and all, but lacks interest and a sence of excitement. Only a few scenes in the game were actually really good, but other than that it's a very slow game. After a few missions, instead of sneaking passed the gaurd, you start to kill them in glorious fashions, reducing the amount of time, but killing the experience and atmousphere.   Combat and movement: The moevment is fine the there are issues with the combat and climbing. When it comes to seriously climbing stough, the character can't seem to do what you want him to do even though the objective is right infront of you. It's frustrating. And the combat sucks, whenever you dodge, you get hit, making it even more frustrating. So for those who want to play this game, make sure you have a good computer! This game will lag alot if you don't and get ready to take things slow, don't rush them.",

I played about 10 hours to beat the games main storyline including a few sightseeing trips and sidequest. So 50 bucks for 10 hours is not really worth it for me.  Why did I recommend it? Scroll down to the bold text. :D   -Spoilers up ahead-   I like the thief franchise but I would not really put it under that name.  Playing the first few chapters you get the feeling this might become an okay game but around the third chapter you kind of start giving up on it. Specially when Zombie/Falmer/Weeper guys start appearing with a super lame and poor explanation of how they came to be. It was really confusing for me since it feld like they didn't quite know what type of game they wanted it to be. Sometimes I felt like it wanted to be a stealth type game then it felt like it wanted to be pure action..suddenly it tries to be a really weird horror game with mentioned above Falmer type creatures that might have been taken from Skyrim.   I do know that people who developed Dishonored also worked with Thief before and I don't know if the storylines from both games were created simultaneously but I got to be honest..  Thief has Gloom and Dishonored had the rat plague Thief has Freaks and Dishonored had the Weepers Thief has the Blind Begger Queen and Dishonored had Granny Rags Thief had Erin taken away but guiding you through the world Dishonored had the Empress and later the heart Thief takes you to the Primal World in Dishonored you were taken into the Void Thief has the Thief Taker General and Dishonored had Slackjaw - both resembling Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York.  Its not always entirely the same in the way they act of function but it is quite close. I have to say I played Dishonored for hours and hours and I could continue doing so but with Thief that is not the case.  The chapters were fast, linear and the guards had a really bad AI.    Non the less it was an okay game just not worth that amount of money. So I will give it recommendation if you:  - Get it when its on sale  - and don't expect a game that feels like one of the Thief ones.   If you don't expect that and you only pay..let's say 20 bucks.. it's a game you can enjoy for a little bit while you have a few hours time  (edit: did some formatting)",

But that really is all that will keep you from giving up on the game.  The main reason for this is that the story is so boring. The first games had excellent and somewhat funny dialogues, along with factions such as the Hammerites and the Pagans that gave such depth to the original games.   And I was expecting to encounter them again in this game, but they were not included because this game is set several decades after the first 3 games. So, obviously, Garrett is not the same person, but a 'descendant'. Still, even if we overlook that fact, the Garrett in this game is not at all engaging and one reason for that is its monotonous voice acting.   It is fun to play but it is not as engaging as Dishonored, for example. Tomb Raider, made by the same studio, is a fine example of an excellent reboot. Thief, on the other hand, left me disappointed as a reboot and does not make me excited for the next Thief installment. Still, I recommend you to play this game because there is such a draught on stealth-based games nowadays.",

            "review_text": "Thief (4) is a steampunk stealth game in first person view. Singleplayer only.  Graphics: 9/10  I really enjoyed the graphics. The textures are well made and the particle effects are fitting and nice to look at. The colors are really well chosen for a night scenario. The lighting and the shadows are very consistent. Although you will see very similar designed rooms and streets it'll never become boring. The equipment is very detailed.  Sound: 8/10  Dripping water, chatting people behind windows, crowing crows, and creaking floorboards. The game has the corrrect sound setting. Locating the enemy by his steps is easy. In comparison to its prequels the sounds improved a lot. But like in the other games of the franchise there is nearly no ambience music at all.  Level design: 9/10  I had everything I wanted in this game: A creepy hospital, a dark city with climbable roofs, sewers, airvents, a home, a big bank with a big safe :D and ancient ruins. This is a big plus of the game. The access to the all cityparts will become available mission for mission which gives you a variety in your actions. By designing realistic climbpaths you will notice quickly where you can get to and which ways are blocked. There are many ways to avoid danger and secret paths will lead to secret loot.   Gameplay/Handling/Equipment: 10/10  There is nothing to complain about the controls. You can switch your equipment in notime and you can move like a ninja through the shadows. The gameplay (knocking out enemies, avoiding traps, getting loot) has been consequently improved and I never saw any bugs. The equipment is upgradable and so are your skills. The upgrades are not that important (to be implemented into the game) but I like them. The bow is your weapon. The arrows are your tools. Rope arrows, water arrows and other useful inventions will help you to steal your enemies' underwear.  AI: 6/10  The AI is ok. Nothing special nowadays. The guards will search for you if you are too loud or stay in the light for too long. Sometimes they have a problem with the altitude, don't react properly and don't work as a team. Since there are no really interesting enemies in this game I give 6/10.  Story: 5/10  The story is not that interesting. The only thing you will count as important are the effects of the rebellion in the city. The whole cultist thing really isn't interesting at all. I think they could have made this part better. Sometimes the rebellion gave me a strange feeling I had in Splinter Cell 3: I'm a super stealthy agent in a real war. Doesn't really fit if you ask me. But I like the characters and most of the sidequests. So I give 5/10  Critic summary: 7,8/10  Personal fun rating: 9/10 [excelent game]  The game is a real improvement. A worthy sequel to the series. There were no frustrating moments in the game and there was always a motivation to get more and more loot. It really makes you feel like a thief who can't pass up a chance to make some extramoney. If you like the genre I strongly recommend to buy it.",

            "review_text": "Initially, sneaking about, looking around and stealing everything would seem to be a tedious affair, but very soon it became a fun activity. Searching for the various paths and locations itself became one of the core game mechanic that also becomes an essential activity as the loot is needed to buy more tools and upgrades. I had a lot of fun avoiding guards, sneaking in the shadows and pick pocketing most of the npcs strolling about. It is this gameplay that made the entire game an enjoyable experience. Also, started off on Thief (Normal) difficulty.  Another game mechanic that I initially was not fond of but grew to like is the various map loading points. Some windows will lead you to another part of the map which requires some loading. Initially, I had to fumble my way through the various windows, searching for a path to reach my designated location and getting lost a few times. All the windows have the same 'blue sheen' so it required some trial and error to find the one that leads to another section of the city. However, after multiple tries, I've managed to actually learn the layout of the city in my mind, and dont need to rely on way points to show me the way. I was surprised to know my memorization prowess was good enough, and didn't need to rely on fast travels, waypoint indicators, and lots of hand holding. I came to appreciate the developers design to remove such accessbility.  On the technical side, there were some performance issues, which mainly is observable in the ingame cutscenes. Fortunately halfway through the main plot, switching the game to use 32 bit binaries managed to solve the performance problems. There was also a very recent patch that made the option to use 32 bit available in the launcher. Kudos to the developer for including that. Also the myriad of difficulty and hud options is heaven sent. I expect lots of videos popping up showing how gamers would be able to complete this game at the highest difficulty along with disabling most if not all of the hud items. Also expecting lots of 1st playthroughs with high difficulty bars set on streaming sites.  The only main negativity I found was the last chapter ending. It appeared to be a haphazard work and it seemed that the developers just decided to brush it off. This left quite a bad aftertaste, especially after having good fun previously. Here's hoping an ending patch (ala ME3).  Overall, an enjoyable game, especially if you're the type that likes running around collecting stuff with customizable hand holding.",

Using only chapter or checkpoint saves gives even a more satisfying tense feeling when a guard walks right next to you and you get sweaty and your pulse starts climbing 'Will he see me, will he see me?!'.  I've heard that it has some sort of combat mechanic? Don't have anything to say about that, haven't tried it out.  About the story I can say that something that happened in the beginning was interesting enough to find out what exactly happened. Still looking forward for the answers.

Map design was hit and miss, some places far too linear but some were great. Sound was an afterthought in this game. Tons of sound issues, looping, double sounds playing over each other, volume issues, hit &amp; miss voice acting. Unlike previous games, sound really is not an integral part of gameplay. Lots of AI issues during gameplay, especially with guards not moving. Usually a save game or checkpoint reload will fix the issue. As a stealth game I felt I got my $60 and would recommend it to the average player. 6/10. Would be 7 or 8 if it didn't have all the bugs, sound and performance issues. They should be able to eventually patch this.  As a long time taffer, I'd have to give this 'Thief' game a 3/10. I've been playing Thief since release in 1998, and still play to this day. The System shock series and Thief are still in my top 5 games list. I believe most hardcore Thief fans like myself, are going to be very dissapointed with this title. If a company is going to retain all the IP and legal rights to a game, why waste it by throwing it out the window? There are some references in the game, and items which you might consider easter eggs that pay omage to the old games.

The typical unreal engine stuttering and texture loading is an annoyance, but not a game breaker. What the MAJOR pain for me is the layout of cities with loading sections littered all over the place when going through windows.  The button bashing when opening a window is an obvious attempt to mask loading times. The objective markers are vague and had me trying to find ways into some places which were not on the current map, I needed to go through a loading window and go around behind. These are the flaws in my opinion which stop this from being a great game. Last gen cross platform games are still hurting people with PCs and new consoles.  I'm not going to bother discussing the plot, because it's about as interesting as watching paint dry.  With all the above flaws the game is enjoyable. Gameplay is more enjoyable than dishonored while technically dishonored is more accomplished.  +Graphical lighting effects +Dark and dank, but always looking pretty +Gameplay is satisfying and sucks you in +Nice sound effects  -Crap story -Technical limitations of engine breakup the fun -Boring characters  Overall a good game which does great in some areas and falls flat on it's ♥♥♥ in other.  8/10  ",

            "review_text": "I know at the time of writing this I only have a few hours of gameplay into Thief, and I will probably add more over the next few days, but there are things about this game that I find let down lovers of the original Thief series.  To be honest, I'm not even sure why this title was 'rebooted' another time after Thief: Deadly Shadows. The answer is probably out there, but I'm just too lazy (and I honestly don't care) to find it.  The first thing I noticed when even starting this game is that it feels very much more like a reboot... far from the roots of the originals.  The world, although they would like you to think it's 'open' leads you by the hand down the garden path. Practically every Thief game prior to this one is very much more 'open' to exploration than this one. In those prior installments, you could at least wander around a bit... find other marks, find other points of interest, find little nooks and secrets that you can explore and loot to your heart's content. This game seems very restrictive by comparison. You can't even jump up on walls or buildings. For a minute there, I was wondering why the game would practically highlight everything that could be climbed or held onto, but now I guess I know why.... because you can't jump up on, climb, or hold onto just anything anymore. It even tells you to 'find a way into &lt;insert building here&gt;' but then puts a freakin' marker on your screen to point out exactly where to go.  The next thing is the dialog. I honestly can't explain why developers think that adding profanity will somehow lead to a better game. The originals managed to do excellent without it. Personally, I find it a sign of a weak script if the developers think they have to sprinkle curse words throughout just to give it some body (which curse words alone can't do). It's getting that I have to ditch my computer speaker system and start using headphones because NOTHING is able to be played around my family anymore.  That said, one of the tiny nitpicky things I found was that the lipsyncing sorta was hit and miss at times. There were a few points where the dialog was done but the character kept flappin' their gums. Other times, the character would speak but their mouth would not move at all.  However, even having said all that, I'm still finding the gameplay OK... yes, merely OK... not stellar, not horrible... just OK. I do have to admit that the environments and texturing are well done and they actually are one thing that shines in this game. At least it still LOOKS like a Thief game. But even then, it doesn't fix what's wrong with the game.  I wish Steam had a sideways thumb... I don't really want to recommend this game for anyone who came from the original Thief series, but it's not entirely a bad game as such. It's just not as immersive as the previous games. So, that being said I will still give it a thumbs up, but it should actually be pointing sideways.",

Except for this one of course :)  I have no idea why the comparison, They are totally different games to be played in a totally different way. I've finished both, they are nothing alike, only extremely superficial people would compare them, but one thing is sure they are both incredible.   Thief oozes quality, re-playability, amazing sounds and visuals, atmosphere is fantastic. It is to be played in a raw fashion, bow and arrow, ghostly assassin, or silent thief. Whereas dishonored is an stealth-action game with supernatural abilities. Really couldn't be more different.   Buy this gem of game, you will not regret it, at the current price, it is a steal.",

Also, this new Garrett doesn't even compare to the middle aged cynic the fans are used to. But as far as mechanics goes, it's a good stealth game, so I'm recommending it.

I hope people find out how to mod this game and somehow remake the original thief games on this, would be great.  EDIT.  I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote this review, but the storyline wasnt a bit dissapointing, it was so bad I don't even really remember what the story was.  I still stand by the fact, the gameplay is great, it feels smooth and fun. they also killed the original feeling of the game, my thought: Theres not really any humor as the originals had, the originals had humor, didnt have sex or much language, but it still maintained a dark brutal feeling world. I feel the entire brothal level was entirely unneeded, and was obviously copied from dishonored, I don't like sex in games period, but I loved dishonored so much, they had a brothal, but they did it much more decently, the girls didnt even have to much skin showing. in Thief, theres a peep hole where you can watch people having sex just not showing the nether regions, but was still very detailed and uncalled for.  they also filled it with language, F words and Sh*t's, which personally I can deal with, but, not a single use of the word 'Taffer' which is like a main word in the entire thief series.  Also, enemy types were awful. DOWN MIGHT BE A ENEMY SPOILER NOT SURE.   there were only guards, a couple mentaly ill people, 1 ghost thingy 'you couldnt even see', zombie 'like' creatures. and some traps if you consider those enemy types.   Don't expect Hammerites or Pagans. completly stripped from the game. the only referance to the hammerites was a cathedral in the background with a hammer on the window, thats it.  Also didnt like that they added the random thirdperson scenes, especially sometimes when climbing a wall it turned into an obvious assassins creed styled thing.    long story short.  the problem with the thief reboot. thief came out and was a great classic. now. things like assassins creed and dishonored came along, and had some nice thief like elements and you could tell in some areas it was inspired. THEN! Thief returned, and wanted to copy them. but it failed and stubbed its toe in the revolving door that is the gaming industry.   Even shorter story. Garrett stole the good parts of the Thief franchise.  If your thinking of buying this and love the thief franchise, I'd suggest waiting for a sale. I pre-ordered this game for 60 dollars and even bought the booster packs. gg.",

First of All, As a veteran Thief series fan I am glad to see the game revived. As the first try for Eidos Montreal taking over the franchise, Thief 4 is a really good game. Not without its flaws and rooms for improvement though, which I’ll get to in a few moments. What I liked always about the game is that Garret doesn’t have paranormal abilities or magic that seems to be too fantasy world driven. At times the story will take us close to the fence of belief and cults but not too much to make it just another boring superhero game.  Garret is a normal character that uses his ingenuity and cunning personality to get thru objectives. What I can say at this point for Eidos is that they have the foundation straight. I like the abilities, I like the costume (very well done), and I like the tools at his disposal.  PROS: - The biggest challenges to watch out for on this game are: Please do not make any challenges harder that these in the future, Eidos. A lot of gamers like the challenge but not impossible ones.  The Dog Chase The Piston at the Keep  Moira Asylum (Not as Creepy as Darkly Shadows but still creepy, Do Not Play at Night!)  The Barons Mansion Escape ( I died a few times on this one, before I got it) Erin’s Final Battle ( If you ever had a whinny sister getting back at you, this is what this feels like J)   CONS: - Tools too expensive at times compared to loot available. (ie..You cannot get to a merchant until the second chapter).  - The somewhat driven scenario is great for first timers, but for the amateurs that are becoming professionals it would be nice that as you increase the difficulty of the game the possible outcomes also change.   - Guards are too predictable compare to older versions of the game. (Now on a future update or Thief 5 this is something Eidos should work more into. Get the enemy AI to change walks if they become suspecting, for example)  - Ector’s Robot story never got anywhere…what was the Barons purpose for it?   I hope with these few pointers Eidos will give us the best Thief ever yet for years to come, even new chapters or update packages will be great as well. ",

            "review_text": "Delving into the past is always a risky move and may not always win a company the encore that they desired. There is a very thin line between changing to much and changing too little in these sorts of games. Change too little and you will be branded as lazy, but change too much and people will start writing death threats to you. To be able to stand on that line takes skill, which unfortunately isn't always there.  Thief, by Eidos Montreal is the reinvention of a classic franchise that has players take on the role of Garrett, THE master thief. When the city that created and defines him is threatened, Garrett must step from the shadows and uncover the truth before his world is torn apart forever.  You begin the game in the middle of a job. Trailing along with you is your young, rash and slightly over confident protégéé Erin. In a nutshell you are tasked with stealing a special stone, you get caught up in the middle of a cult's ritual, Erin dies and you fall asleep for a year.  It is when you wake up that the story truly begins, if you can call it a story. Throughout the 8 main missions it is really quite difficult to keep track of the storyline. All of the major events and characters that are meant to invoke an emotional response in the player just feel dull and boring, and the story elements just feel like a puzzle that's had all the pieces thrown in in the hope they will fit together. The story has to main ideas, the city is in peril and Garret just doesn't care and a revolution has begun but Garret just want's to find Erin. Your quest to find answers will unfortunately be quite boring and mundane, in many cases will only be half answered. 'How the hell did Garrett get super thief powers?' is just one example. If you're looking for an enticing story to keep you hooked, the predictable betrayals and confusing plot points aren't enough to carry you through to the unsatisfying ending.  However even with a whitewash for a story there is a silver lining, however thin. The stealth and thievery in this game is tremendously enjoyable, addictive even. Thief has abandoned the action loaded gameplay for a slow and stealthy style, and they have done this to good effect. As you will find as you play the game a majority of the missions require you to steal everything in your path. This will involve; lifting valuables, breaking into safes, and disappearing into the shadows. To help you with this you are given an arsenal of different gadgets, that will allow you to access new areas so that you can steal even more. Fire, Water and Gas arrows are also invaluable in distracting your enemies.  Different arrows available to you in Thief  Using all your gadgets and equipment effectively is extremely rewarding in a way that is hard to describe. It's as if you are a real thief, sneaking around in the shadows, disabling traps with your wire cutters, opening vents with your wrench or dousing flaming torches with your water. It is this feeling that probably kept me playing through even the worst moments of the game.  The thieving in itself is an artform that will take many an hour to master. In every draw or cabinet there could be valuable treasure, on every desk there could be a clue to help you find a valuable treasure. It is up to you to find which draws actually do contain valuables and which on which desktops there are clues, but one thing is for certain. The thieving aspect can be dangerous, a guard could spot you at any moment so you must be very careful. The fact that it is so easy for a guard to spot you whilst you are opening a draw and the fact that you are very vulnerable whilst doing so creates an extremely addictive tension, and one must experience it in order to truly understand. It also allows one to become distracted so that they no longer have to concentrate on the many pitfalls of the game.  Nice Golden Wine Bottle you can steal in Thief  Side jobs, as in any game, are optional. But if you truly want to understand what drives this dark and gloomy city it is strongly recommended. These jobs will allow you to meet citizens offering high risk jobs that can earn you some serious gold and some interesting experiences. Challenge mode is also recommended if you want to test your sneaking skills in well designed, timed scenarios. There are enough of these little hidden jobs and missions to keep you occupied and exploring the dark and mysterious city of Thief.  Surprisingly enough this game often feels too dark. Yes as a Thief it would make sense that most of the things you do occur in darkness but it seems that, no matter where you go the lighting never changes. You could be in a house, castle or out on the streets and it still feels like you are just in a dark room trying to steal stuff. This doesn't make the game any better or worse, and it does create some atmosphere but I think it would have been more interesting if the lighting had have varied more throughout the game.  Dark City of Thief The game is sometimes surprisingly too dark. Unfortunately when you start looking to aspects other than stealth to keep you entertained you will find that you are very limited. The combat for example, feels like it was thrown in as an after thought. Yes it is a stealth game and the aim is not to get caught but occasionally you will run into the odd guard. All you have to defend yourself is a high tech metal club and a weak dodge move and when you are coming up against fully armoured men with crossbows and swords, theres not much you can do to stop them from running you through.  Armoured City Guard in Thief Thief Combat isn't great. On this gloomy note we shall move to the sound glitches. On multiple occasions I experienced looping guard dialogue, that continued until I got annoyed and shot the guard. There was also some inaudible speech during in-game cutscenes. It annoyed me even more that these occurred more often towards the end of the game, which means that I missed out on something that could have been vital to the storyline, but anyway. While there were too many sound glitches for a AAA game like Thief the experience wasn't completely ruined and I was able to push on.  To sum up, if you are looking for a stealth based experience then Thief will probably fit the bill, although Dishonored may be more to your liking. Despite it's terrible storyline and multiple glitches it was enjoyable and I feel I got enough out of it for it to be worth the money.  Thief Official Site  Our YouTube Channel",

Graphics are really good, a set up over human revolution but they seem to have come at a design cost in the form of loading screens. Combat was done much better in previous games. The interactivity of the world is a big improvement over past games. In comparison to Dishonoured, Thief is much darker, even though it draws on similar themes. Garret is a much more interesting character than Corvo but the voice artist in this game does not give the best performance. Gone is the world weary Garret and he is now a bit too smug.",

            "review_text": "Now that I have calmed down from my 'nostalgic' rage, I have to admit: Thief (2014) is a decent game. I wouldn't go call it a master piece or very good, but it's fairly good and a nice experience on its own. If you start comparing it to the original versions or even Dishonored you are very likely to find a ton of things to nitpick and cry about. This was the mistake I did the first time, and although it was somewhat justified, it was in the end a bit unfair since I have to judge the game as ITSELF, not as a recreation of bygone glory days or as a rival to something else.  With that said, I personally have enjoyed this new installment. There are, like mentioned, TONS of little and bigger things to complain about, namely the very restricted movement around the small sandbox environment you dwell in, and buggy A.I. (I just love the dialogue audio problem where the guards keep repeating the same things all the time... not). I also found the new way of peeking around the corners absolutely stupid (whatever happened to good ol' Q and E?), and the cinematic cutscenes look dámn weird at times - from cinematic view, that is. The story I couldn't care less about, and the chance to roam yourself from mission to mission in the city, although cool at first, is just tedious in the long run and I find myself getting lost half the time, thanks to the pretty useless map. I just wanted to get the mission started, not to trying to navigate through the confusing city layout and pondering which rope or ladder would lead me to a window that'd took me to the right place!  And with THAT all said... I still like the game. The missions are fun to play when you adjust yourself to the game mechanics and the overall philosophy (meaning, the less you kill the more you enjoy the challenge), and some of the maps are just brilliant when it comes to gameplay, almost bringing memories from the Thieves of yore. Do I recommend this rebirth? Meh... on sale, definetely. If you loved Dishonored and unchristianly worshipped the original ones as your Lords and Saviors, I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one as well... provided you play it with open mind. So, I might even recommend it. I think I will.",

Hated the stealth in AC4 (although is a great game) and hoped that this game would show how a stealth game should be.  CONS: almost no freedom, poor AI, anoying bugs (specially the sound), and for me, VERY repetitive. Enemies have only 2 types, respawn of guards in the city, a lot of loading screens, and the lack of chars to interact. Lazy difficulty system (on/off hud itens).  PROS: playing w/ Garret again is like meeting an old friend. Graphics and atmosphere are great. Some chapters are memorable and beautifuly designed. The first hours were really good to play. The optional focus system is a great idea for newbies.  The AI is the more disappointing part. Scripted, dumb and lifeless. They should look real, go ask for help, surround, reinforce the protection (a more complex script at least). Instead, they act like an game from the 90's. Things shoud look really difficult to steal. Killing a guard should always be the last option.  I was hoping an open stealth sand box, challenging AI and next gen graphics. Got only the last one. This game will be forgotten in some months, result of the poor experience, little replay factor and no innovation in the genre.   Don't pay the full price if you're not a fan of the series.",

The tendency of reviewers to go mad as soon as a game does not reflect the reviewers expectation a 100%, is tiresome.  This unprofessional babbling has nothing to do with reviewing objectively any longer. Every one can do it. It is mostly just the expression of a very biased opinion but disguised as a review.   One article even rated Thief as alow as 40%.... come on, really? 40%?? This is a highly polished game, with a lot of atmosphere. Even the view of the scenes alone makes it worthwhile to play. How can one seriously rate it as low as a broken game (which 40% would imply - Yet the game is all but broken.)  If you expect the freedom of previous Thief games, you will be disappointed.  However, if you take the game for what it is, it is still a lot of fun. The tone it sets, and the mood it creates is very dark, distopian and gritty. Its first person movement immerse you well into the actions, and there are a ton of options to customize your difficulty. You can even switch off entire UI elements to immerse yourself even deeper.  At times you struggle with the controls, but it is nothing game breaking and I got used to handle it as time passed.  Thief's only big mistake is it's rather linear gameplay in the main missions, which is really the only downside of an otherwise great game.",

The primary character can't do simple things (like jump) except in certain occasions, which means they had to put ramps in areas to allow access. Seriously, what kinda crap is that? Can't even hop up in the air to look at something? Console-like key functions get boring and frustrating (to open windows, hold a key, then hit it over and over until the window opens), wasting 10 seconds on some windows, while others open after the initial space bar. Plus, why keep locking drawers Ive already unlocked if there's nothing in them the 2nd time around? Can't skip some of the long mandatory 'watch this to see how great the story is' scenes, like the elevator ride up. Can't skip the 'look how scary we can (not) be' scenes. Watching them during the first playthrough was barely tolerable. I didnt buy the game expecting Oscar-winning actors, and after the first, somewhat disappointing, disjointed ending, IDGAF about the 'story line'. Fine, have mandatory crapscenes the first play-through, then allow them to be skipped. Also, if I wanted to play a 2-D side shooter where I'm locked in to one course of action, I WOULDNT, because I don't. Running through collapsing buildings trying to get loot before I burn to death, dying , then trying again and again until I make it through by trial and error. Not enjoyable, no benefit to the game, I'd say someone's girlfriend or boyfriend wanted to show off his/her arcade style design skills. Also didn't enjoy wandering around trying to figure out how to get where I needed to go . Surely it wouldn't have been too hard to have a map with freaking location names on it. I'd bet that was left out so that the total time spent searching for a way to get to a portion of the city could be counted as play time, when it's not really. The end of-mission rewards for goals didn't make sense. Ok fine, let's have a goal like don't be detected, and then have one for 10 combat takedowns, which pretty much means one of them isn't achievable. At least if I DO 3 or 4 of the goals, why are only 2 of them shown at the end? Are the goals based on play style? Also, have one AUTOSAVE slot of you must, but if I hit quick load, allow it to load MY last save,. On the topic of saving, what moron came up with the idea that we can't save if anyone is looking for us? Sneaking through an area for 10 minutes, get spotted by one guard and we can't save while anyone is alerted even if we're hiding and there's no way they can reach us? That's a CROCK!. Next, the restrictions on passing through the transitions where we need to move a board. Dash to an exit , get spotted by a guard, try to move through the exit and get told,no , you have to stay, wait for the guard to come up and fight him. Again, BS. On the topic of fighting, yeah, I get it, we're not supposed to fight. I guess the same moron designed the fight limitations. Hit someone with a sword, try to hit them again, nope! can't do it, gotta pause until they hit you back. Can't block, and dodging wont work if youre in a narrow area. Same thing with trying to blackjack someone to initiate a combat takedown. Sitting for 5 seconds mashing the blackjack key while the screen is prompting me to do a regular takedown, then the guard turns around and I get nailed by 3 other guards when he yells because I couldnt initiate a combat takedown. Just crappy crappy coding.  Now that I've listed (most) of the irritating and pointless parts of this game that had the potential to be great, but missed, here are the good parts. Not many FPS games are worth a crap anymore. This one wasnt great, suffered from an attempt to make it more than it was, but it was fun when I wasn't trying to figure out how to get to a certain portion of the city if I didn't want to go on a prescribed mission. I did like being able to see what the goals were for each mission, but I and many others figured out how to by accident. I like the ability to jump from target to target in mid-air without falling. I like the bow, but it's underpowered until after it's leveled up. Shoot someone in the head or face with a bow, they should be down for the count, period. Over all, did I like the game, despite the many shortcomings? Yes. Was it worth $59? HELL NO!! Would I spent $59 on another game from the same developer? Nope, sorry. $50 and up should be reserved for top of the line, well-written games. No longer does just being New mean a game should be priced that high. I do recommend the game, but with reservations. I'd give it a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. That might seem like a low score, but a lot of the games coming out are only 3 to 5. The main benefit is this game CAN be played for hours and hours.",

            "review_text": "I highly recommend this game for any gamer who is into excellent, top notch, stealth games. Where many people state that Thief doesnt provides ways through to an objectives as advertized and that it is only a point A to point B game; yes, thats what it is however, there are MULTIPLE ways to get through to something and it is how you get from point A to point B that matters. You are armed with a bow, and the environment around you, you have the ability to buy upgrades for your gear and obtain Focus points (Perk points to enhance your skills and make the game slightly easier) So it is a stealth game with limits, but you can still play how you see fit.  I will note to anyone wanting to buy this game though, the setting is very similar to that of Dishonored in terms of, there is a plauge ravaging the city but where in Dishonored that was the primary reason for doing things. In Thief a plauge is there as a reason to why there are limitations in the city, it holds little to no focus. The story (plot) is about people fighting for power, how it affects the lower classes, and that greed for power is ultimatley what plauges the city. So for story wise, I also reccomend it, if you keep in mind the irony that you are a Thief and what everyone else does around you. Also, it is a FIRST PERSON game, but one of the best I have played.  If you liked Dishonored, you will like Thief, if you enjoyed the original Thief games, you will greatly enjoy this. Take my advice, in purchasing this game though; wait until it goes on sale. Square Enix will undoubtedly create more DLC so save money where you can!  Also note, this is a Reboot, people complain that it is not like the original Thief, and it isn't. But don't let that knock you out of giving this Reboot of a series a good shot. This game was released in a different generation and is very good for what it is.

At one point I just got sick of opening and closing drawers and basically steal everything because it felt like it was the only point of the game. The first part is very similar to Dishonored but then it's like the writers decided to change course halfway and instead of a plague infected city you have a thing called primal that got into a girl's body and made her create the gloom and blind faceless naked monster (wtf?). Then there was a scene at an asylum totally out of character for this game and that aspect could have been better explored because it was the most interesting part for me (phantoms, loonies, hidden cashes, and an overral good story). But then it was over and back we go to stealling all the things. I also have to complain about the map, it's horrid, takes 20m to get to a place.

Thief 1 and 2 where great I didn't care as much for deadly shadows on the xbox. The console versions I believe held the game back and loading screens throughout the city broke up the immersion. That is one of the issues I have with the new thief. Even though we have new consoles out they are still underpowered when compared to a good gaming pc which i'm playing on. The city is once again broken into sections that must load. The load screen is only 2 seconds tops for me but it still kind of breaks the immersion. Besides that I am very impressed so far with the game, in comparison to the older games everything has been improved, besides not having garrets voice actor back. Gameplay wise Garret moves smoothly through the city and climbs and jumps with ease. Some people have said the game is very linear but I've mainly been getting lost exploring the city, there are all kinds of paths and tunnels to travel through. So far I have played the first main mission and have been going at the side missions, the side missions are a good way to explore the city. I am playing on master difficulty with everything turned off. The game is a true stealth game which I am very pleased that they kept it this way. Once again if you are seen by a gaurd you will have a tough time fighting them off, two gaurd and your as good as dead. The atmosphere is great and like old thief games you have to really search for some loot. The first mission its easy to find but after that its more challenging. There is much to find for those who like to explore something like 200 documents, 84 unique loot items among other challenges to find. I'm disappointed that people are bashing this game because it really is a good time. In a world where irrational games closes, and where tomb raider selling 4 millions copies is considered not worth thier time making it I am worried about thief and other unique titles. So many people will look at a review by someone who doesn't understand the genre and then not buy a game. If you are a gamer that is sick of call of duty then buy this game. This will be a good example to other publishers, they will be watching to see if this genre can make money, if it doesn't sell well then you can bet that this is the last thief game we will see again and other publishers won't want to take the risk making anything other than shooters. Gamers need to show that they will buy other experiences besides shooters. Titan fall was a blast and will sell well but gamers really need to buy other kinds of games such as thief. True thief fans should really like the game unless they are the kind that go into this with a poor attitute to begin with.

The only thing that bugged me in this game was the overworld map, way too many loading screens although at max they were 10 seconds.  Finally all the good things:  Stealing feels great, it never gets old watching yourself reach out and really grab the things you're stealing.  Controls are very tight, everything feels good.   Funny Dialogue, great one liners.  The scary level is really scary.  The UI and difficulty levels are completely customizable, there is no excuse for complaining about mechanics because almost everything is able to be turned on or off. You want a completely clean UI with no world indicators? You can have it.  This still feels like thief.

I really appreciated the atmosphere, the city itself is wonderful, dark and somehow gothic. The graphics are impressive, running on an appropriate machine (like I do). I enjoyed much more running free around the city instead of following the main quest (wait, that's not Skyrim!!).  The mechanics are easy to understand, there are a variety of gadgets you can use during your Chapters, but actually you can afford to play even nearly without any of them. I mean there are no such situations in which you think 'Damn, I really need to use &lt;gadget&gt; to make it!', and the city doesn't remind me of a living city, with living people: you can jump into windows, searching for loot in the drawers and noone will notice. That's a little down for me, 'cause there is all the potencial for a great stealth game, but it's like it lacks of personality, like a plain board. The story itself is not something that keeps your attention from minute to minute, that encourages you to keep on following the main objectives: I found it somehow predictable.. I preferred to play it little bits at a time, beside playing 'The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot'. That's not even 'Bug-FREE' (360 Guards? -.-)..  I can't avoid to compare this game to Dishonored, in which I found a more intense and intriguing story (even if very simple: 'I'm accused of murder? Let's kill everyone!') and the whole scenario was various and bautiful. Even the story DLCs were pretty awesome.  Garret is a great character, it deserves a great story.  I hope that EIDOS will work on something better the next time =) (or maybe a DLC!)  Anyway, technically it's still a good game, with great potencial. Buy it if you're Garret fan!!",

Let me explain, Thief have lots of UI features that can make this game playable for 7 year child, but also have the possibility to turn all that off and bring it close to what past games were on that regard, and believe me, if you turn all that off, the game change completly (besides the AI that same times become very predictable) and force you to actually think the best aproach, there isnt much options in term of routes but past thief games were never a open world either, so most hate on that regard is really unreasonable.  I didnt like the gameplay at first in my first playthrougt, thats why i played 2 chapters and left the game in my library almost 2 years, then there was a month that my ISP had problems and i didnt had net and thief was one of the few games i had installed that i could play with steam offline, so, i decided to finish that and try again but with diferent aproach, since i didnt touch the custom diff the first time.   I had more fun in my second playthrough and made my money worth while, and that`s what really important to me not past games or what is better old vs new, thief is good stealth game by itself if you bother to use its features, dont really need its predecessors to survive (i dont really compare them since diferent times, based on diferent ideas) or it shouldnt if people were able to look at it was game not a serie.  It have good graphics, sound and voice acting, well detailed levels but many loading points that could be avoided by a better placed sections of the map, the gameplay give diferent options, any of them satisfying, be it stealth or not but the lack of a strong story to support all of that, can make a tin line betwen fun and boring, but still, another decent game that didnt deserve its fate.

At every turn the game loves to remind you that you're not playing Thief: The Dark Project, or even Dishonored, what with its compact level design, intrusive transitional load screens, Garrett's inability to jump and mantle anywhere other than where the level designers say he should, the almost completely useless tools and arrows, a laughable upgrade system, etc. On top of all that we have a nonsensical narrative that lead writer Rhianna Pratchett disowned, an over reliance on chapter denouments that have Garrett running away from Michael Baysplosions, and evidence that the QA department were clearly testing another game entirely: guards get stuck on patrol routes, dialogue drowned out by music, sound samples misfiring all over the place, enemies three rooms away sounding like they're standing right next to you, etc.  And yet, amidst all this turbulence and chaos, there still lies a satisfying stealth experience. Levels show occasional flashes of inspired design, the use of light and shadows is frequently spectacular, the city itself is a wonderful labyrinth of streets, alleyways, courtyards, rooftops and secret passages, and many of the smaller, more tightly focused client missions outshine some of the larger narrative missions. Play on Master (or an even more challenging custom difficulty mode) with all the HUD elements, loot glint and quest markers turned off and you'll have a more rewarding experience than if you merely stick to all the default settings.   The best yardstick I can suggest to judge this game by is Thief: Deadly Shadows. This rebooted Thief is very much in the vein of Ion Storm's approach to the series rather than the Looking Glass-esque game most of us were hoping for. If you can tolerate Deadly Shadows, you can probably tolerate Thief. Just wait for a seasonal sale if you still have your doubts.",

From what I've seen, this game is getting really mixed reviews from steam, to metacritic, to youtube, and the community seems very split on whether they think the game is good or not. I don't believe the answer is binary in this case.  Before I got the game I thought that the gameplay was horrible and antiquated and wasn't planning on getting it. I saw some early footage and none of it appealed to me, however I decided to pick it up after watching a few gameplay videos on youtube. Once I played the game, my perception changed as I actually enjoyed the experience.   The game is not bad, but I could definitely see why people wouldn't like it. The arguements that the game is linear, an on-rails experience, repetitive once you reach latter stages of the game, etc. are not unfounded. Despite all this, I have to disagree that it is less valuable of an experience because of these things. Some of the positive things I have to say about this game is that the attention to detail on the setting and ambience make it look beautiful, the mechanics are great, the story is not the best but it's not the worst either, and it is a fun experience.  Maybe it's just people have different tastes and the review system is flawed because it can't cater to everyone's individual preferences, but my needs were met with Thief. It's not bad but it's not for everyone, just don't go in thinking it's revolutionary or it will bring a strong sense of nostalgia. The truth lies somewhere in the middle.",

The story isn't phenomenal but decent enough to keep you interested and side missions are plentiful if you search for them. The stealth elements in this game are great, the blackjack combat however, I find unenjoyable, which in itself kinda feels like a good thing. Thieves don't fight, when they're discovered, they run. That's exactly what the combat makes me want to do. I feel weak and powerless against more than two enemies and it makes me want to flee and rethink my strategy, really adding to the intensity of the game when you are fleeing and tests you patience and skill while you wait for the perfect opportunity to slip by unnoticed, I enjoy the large variety of different arrows at Garrett's disposal. I also like how Garrett is not equipped with a wide array of letal weapons, seeing as you are a thief not an assassin. This brings me to another point; people comparing this game to Dishonored... It is nothing like it. In Thief you play.. a THIEF. In Dishonored, you play an ASSASSIN. Big Difference. I guess the way I see it, the only similarity they share is the ability to pickpocket and crouch to sneak past enemies. I played VERY LITTLE of the original Thief series and this is probably why I like this so much. (I am a long time fan of the Resident Evil series and, shoot me, but 4 was the turning point that lead the series into a downward spiral, so I understand long time Thief fans not enjoying this one as much.) Now, this game is not without it's issues, guards repeat the same phrase over and over, sometimes even overlapping the phrase they are saying with the exact same thing, I swear I'm sick of hearing about Polly Adler. Intense music starts playing for no reason, like when I'm just sneaking around. Bugged out so bad earlier I had to restart my computer to fix it (Kept going to the very bottom option on the menu screen, regardless of where my mouse was.) Could just be my mouse but feeling for switches behind paintings SUCKS. In conclusion though, I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the stealth genre, I understand the previous fans dislike cause that's how I am with RE, but for anyone new to the series, this is an excellent stealth game that you are sure to enjoy.",

It does still give a good stealthy experience though, and the massive flexibility you have in its difficulty makes Thief a good game to get for a lower price. *Note: Not recommended for full price. I got the game for €18,-, and for that price its a good game(max price I would pay would be €30,-)  Stealth games are just like puzzles, infact every guard/dog/bird you encounter is a puzzle to solve: Do I sneak by him, distract him, kill him, or just wait and see if he moves away? And if I do that, what are the consequences? This is the part of the game that Thief shines in, you feel a thief.. you are garreth, and you will not be seen! Or at least you hope, with your hearth in your troath and the adrenaline rushing through your veins. It is a shame though that Eidos couldnt create a decent story around these scenario’s. The, supernatural, story of Thief is bland and eventhough it takes you to some great places(a colorfull brothel for example) where you really have plenty of options to think about, most of the story-driven levels are narrow corridors, without to much room to really improvise.  There are the times that, especially in the side-mission, the levels do open up. Giving you more room to breath, more room to explore, and more possible entrys(going through the door? Vents? Basement? Roof? Etc). This is how every mission should be in Thief, in these mission you actually love the game and forgive its problems...if only Eidos would’ve realised this. Garreths new focus-power is a decent addition. No longer do you have to explore every wall in the room for a switch, just turn on your focus. You can also use focus point to upgrade garreth: more stealthy, making the lockpick mini game even easier, overpower alerted guards. This all offcourse if you want to, because...  The best part of Thief is the massive flexibility you have in its difficulty. Offcourse you the basic: Easy, Normal, Hard(Roque, Thief, Master) but on top of that you have the Custom option. This option gives you the option to make Thief as hardcore as you want. Want to play it like the original Thief: turn on chapter saves only(no manual or checkpoint saves), turn Focus off, turn the reticle of, and turn of the abiltiy to make combat-takedowns. On top of that you can make the items more expensive, remove the ability to use non-special arrows, move slower, cant take any damage. The game also has its Iron Man-mode, be spotted or die once and you can start over again... the whole game that is.",

            "review_text": "Many people are giving this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviews because they are comparing it to either previous Thief titles or Dishonored. In the former, the major complaint is drifting away from stealing emphasis, and the immersive sandbox feel, while in the latter, the comparisons were made on advances made in the genre.  It is wholly unfair to judge the game under those variables. Firstly, as an installment in the Thief franchise, it stands on it's own two feet as a great title. IMO, better than Thief 3 Deadly Shadows and I like it more than the Dark Project. What it tries to out do from the original Thief titles it does so in a way which may be alien to some players. The jumping, acrobatics, and action controls being some of them. With an introduction to a wide array of new abilities, realistic ones (further comparison will shortly made), and larger exploration area, the game had to make some of the controsl a bit complex. Admittedly, it was a bit annoying to get used to, but it flows fairly easily after 20 minutes of game play.  Secondly, let's have a little bit of a discussion of it being compared to Dishonored a game I played, and enjoyed quite a lot. The two games share a lot in temrs of similarities, but those similarities are shallow at best. Both are set in an early industrial age/ victorian/ steam punk setting, and both involve a light amount of 'mysticism' to take hold, although Dishonored takes it to the next level. Both share a back story of a 'plague' that is ravaging the city and both have a dictator like antagonist to deal with. In terms of plotline, there are definite similarities...but how many times you hear this story: a chosen youth destined for greatness embarks on a world saving quest with the help of his plucky team...or, a wanderer in a kingdom full of intrigue and plotlines where the wanderer is the chosen one destined to change the course of history by slaying x...the story? Meh, poor variable to judge these games on.. Aesthetics aside, the diffirences start immerging in two diffirent factors: 1) immersion, 2) realism.   In my opinion, Thief does a hell of a lot better job at making the game world more immersive. It is far less linear, the City being greatly expanded upon, far far more lore, hidden things and mysteries. And where as Dishonored had to frequently remind me that the City around them was in ruins and crumbling, pointing out rats, talking about rats, talking about the plague, for the most part the city remained lifeless. It didn't have many inhabitants, and that's primarily because in Dishonored the gameplay is linear. You return to a small tavern after each mission to recoup, but that's it. Thief does by showing it to you, wander the streets of The City and you see life all around you, peaceful NPC Noblemen and Noblewomen,, rotting corpses on the streets in slums, people huddled up and suffering, whispering secrets amongst themseleves. In Thief the city is so crowded, it's streets so narrow, it's buildings tall an ominous, that it feels like you're constantly being chocked. You can feel the miasma in crawling, the fog, the coughing bums wandering around. In this sense, Thief is far closer to Deus Ex than really Disohonored, allowing a lot of explorable area for the player to walk around in.  And realism. Let's face it. One of the first abilities I had gotten in Dishonored was that tele-jump ability which I have used over and over and over to get to areas and obstacles. I had near magic powers in my disposal, and honestly, I didn't feel all that vulnerable. Hell, even if I did get caught, and a bunch of guards attacked, I could withstand a good few waves before dying, which is virtually impossible in Thief. Garret in Thief doesn't have many magical powers. If any. The only 'magic' he has is a sense, the ability to scan a room fo ranything usable or collectable. And a sense of intuition of when you're in light/darkness, when someone is aware of you and when they aren't. Hell, even the mini map is highly restrictive in showing you where you are. When Garret needs to quick-tele somewhere he does a quick lunge, but it's still something you feel him doing. You see yourself move forward and if you run over anything that makes sound, guess what, it will make a sound. When you get arrows and tools, you have such a small amuont yuo can carry that it takes a lot of consideration to use it. In Dishonored I really didn't feel the need to use a lot of the items.  So in essence, comparing it to Dishonored is faulty as well. If we were to do so objectively, we can conclude that they stand out quite diffirently on their own two feet.   I say this, if you're expecting this to be Thief 2 with better graphics - it ain't it. And it won't be it, and I doubt you'd really enjoy it if it WAS it. But if you get this game and judge it on it's own merits, and not comparing it to other titles out there. It is ridiculously fun. Immersive. And enjoyable.",

So many new stealth games have come out in recent years, that the only way for Thief to retain it's crown is to go back to what it did best, immersion, simplicity and a focus on core gameplay interaction.  The plot is weak, and the use of stealth is all but optional. Any situation can be resolved with brute force and often has to be as the visibility range is binary, either your invisible or your seen, there's very little 'hey did I just see something' to be used as both a warning, and a valid diversionary tactic - the same can be said for sound, smash a bottle on the wall to far away and you're ignored. Too close and you're spotted.   Most of the game is spent waiting for an NPC to finish it's patrol route so you can time your movements accordingly.  This is not a bad game, infact it's very good. It's just not very groundbreaking. It's nothing that we havn't seen in Dishonoured or Assassin's Creed and die hard fans of the series are likley to be a little dissapointed.  Just once i'd like to see a stealth game where NPC movements are more realistic and less patrol-routey. Never in my life have I seen a security guard walk the same square route over-and-over, pausing to sigh at the same point every time. It ruins the suspense, almost entirely removes the threat of getting caught and relies more on the player to taking risks to have a chance of a reactive situation.",

There's a semblance of 'open-world' attempts through side missions but for the most part you're going to be led through linear environments with some freedom about how to get to a destination but not as open ended as you would expect coming from Eidos' previous entry: Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  The plot starts out alright, kind of interesting, but it takes a turn for the ridiculous and you'll probably not remember a lot that happens, but the gameplay is solid. I've never played the earlier Thief games, but the gameplay for this is similar to Dishonoured. I think that's the best way to describe this: like Dishonoured. The only part about the gameplay that doesn't feel like Dishonoured is the combat. There is a definite emphasis on stealth and while you 'can' counter and dodge enemy attacks you're more often than not going to be taken out instead of actually a formidable match. So, in other words, it's a stealthier Dishonoured.  If Thief does anything more than average it's the atmosphere. The game looks good, feels forboding, and sneaking around feels like you're a silent predator in a situation. That's what I would recommend Thief for: the atmosphere. It's worth it for that and if you're a big fan of stealth or generally a completionist. Thief puts a huge emphasis on stealing ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. Seriously, anything that isn't bolted to the floor is fair game. For a 'master thief' it feels odd stealing spoons and cups when there are bigger scores, but stealing stuff is encouraged through completionist scores and gives you gold to spend on upgrades and gear. So if you're a huge kleptomaniac and a completionist then this is in your wheelhouse; buy now.. Other than that, it's a polarizing game. Sure, it's good, it's not bad, but it's difficult to say what isn't so great about it. The game runs fine, it looks good, it does what it says it does (you steal stuff and sneak around) but I never felt like it was exciting me. I wanted to play it and to finish it but it wasn't to uncover a mystery or because I wanted to sneak around more guards. It's tough to describe what makes it not great.   I'd definitely recommend it if you can get it for around $30&lt; otherwise I'd pass. I got it for $25 on a Humble Bundle sale and I feel like that's just right for a game like this following Deus Ex HR.",

Sure the story is a bit flat mostly due to boring characters, but i rather enjoyed it. The graphics are nice and the animations smooth, although i think there are too many of the latter which can become annoying. But they do a great job of level design and the ambiance really sets the mood for any particular level. The in-level puzzles are fun and intruding and sometimes challenging making the game similar to the new Tomb Raider in that respect. The game is designed with different play styles in mind and even encourages playing the levels differently increasing its replay value. I like the idea of the open-world city (which doesn't actually have a name) between missions ,its packed with some extra side missions and lots of loot and easter eggs to find if your a completionist. This also allows for a “store” out of mission meaning your items and weapons carry over between missions as well as character upgrades are available to purchase. All together this makes this fun but not excellent game. Where it really falls flat is in comparison to the original series. You are limited in the use of your specialty arrows allowing them only to be used on specific objects in the game which destroys the creative problem solving that made the originals so fun. They have also made Garrett look weird he looks like a skinny Gothic dude who's into S&amp;M. And i also really miss the gaurds calling everyone a taffer.

Missing elements :o There are a few things missing from the game that were also missing in Deadly Shadows such as the humour (probably just rats... Rats would be a bit 'o meat) and the supernatural element(s) (Zombies, Burricks, Apparitions, Haunts, Flying Sentient Water/Fire/Air Elementals, Crayman, Giant Incests, Tree Beasts, Pagan Ape Men) that were rife in the first game and seem to have lessened with each game thereafter.

I thought I might enjoy it, since I don’t know what the other games were like. I did actually enjoy… some parts of the game.  Well, first of all there was a lame story hidden somewhere in the game, but I didn’t really care about it, since I was too busy running around on rooftops, stealing everyone’s s**t instead of listening to Garrett’s brooding. To be honest, I was so happy that nobody was at home, while I, as a master thief, was stealing all of their pretty pens in the middle of the night… Well, okay, this was the actual part of the game, that I happened to like, along with the side missions, even though I felt kind of bad for stealing from poor people who only had a ring. (I might be wrong, but didn’t the old Garrett steal from nobles and such?) Anyway the game is really short if you only play the main missions, since most chapters take like 40-60 minutes even with hiding, and there are only 8 chapters. The stealth system was fine, I also liked the graphics, but sometimes the places were really confusing. I liked to explore, but I broke into the same houses a few times, because everything looked the same and it’s hard to tell if I’ve been there already or not.  The whole game is just depressing, since everyone was just standing there, whining about everything, and there wasn’t a single person in the game, who had at least one good thought. Garrett was also depressed, the girl was annoying, the guards were jerks for no reason, and the people were sad and miserable. There are good ways to make a dark game, but this is not one of them, since it became really irritating after a time.  A lot of people said it’s like Dishonored and that’s true. There is plague and such, even some chapters were similar and it had our dear old, blind Granny Rags, I mean the Queen of Beggars or something like that. My problem is, that I really don’t understand, why this game had to use the same system. In Dishonored you could do the missions however you wanted, because you were a bodyguard/assassin, but here you play as a thief, why would you act like a fighter? In my opinion, there shouldn’t be an option to just run through the map alerting everyone. Anyway there were elements from Assassin’s Creed, too, and maybe from Outlast, because they just had to make a horror chapter in a creepy asylum for whatever reason. Maybe they thought that the game is not dark enough yet, it needed more horror, because a morgue house was not enough… I am pretty sure that most people want play this game for stealth, not for running around in a haunted asylum, waiting for a jumpscare to happen.  It’s not a good game, it’s simply an okay game. I’d recommand it, since you might enjoy hiding and stealing stuff, because that was the only fun thing to do here, but anyway, get it only on sale.",

When a game gives a stealth approach toward playing it, I almost always choose it.  This new iteration of Thief is not nearly as bad as all the review sites will have you believe; It's actually pretty good entertainment. Is it better than The Dark Project or The Metal Age? Of course not, but frankly we're never going to get amazing games like those ever again. It's time to move on. Or don't. That's fine. You can still acquire those games through Good Old Games or Steam. This is just as good as Deadly Shadows, maybe even alittle better (I literally played through Thief 3 the week before this came out, so it's still very fresh in my mind)  Is the story good? Meh. It's ok at best. I do like all the hints at the factions we were so use to seeing before.  How about the level design? It's abit linear, yes. Very pretty though. There is an asylum level halfway through that is just as creepy and atmospheric as Shalebridge Cradle ever was, and is much more terrifying, imo.  Is the immersion good? I think so, yes. I love how much you see of him using his hands. I think it really helps draw you in to First Person games.  Is the sound quality as good as the other Thiefs? Kinda varies. For the most part its great, but sometimes certain lines are spoken really quietly or the audio and animations aren't synched up. Currently there is a bug where dialogue between npcs simply repeats over and over. Also nobody says taffer. :( Disappointing.  My one major gripe with it would have to be Garret's visual appearance. I HATE THAT MASK/SCARF THING he wears. He looks like a gothic frog. I would pay money for a dlc skin that made him look more like a classic version. I would also pay money for a dlc that used Stephen Russel as a voice-over. The new guy (Romano Orzari) doesn't do a bad job though. He just doesn't feel as emotive as Russel did.  You really connected to Russel's Garret; probably what helped was because he narrated the story inbetween levels. You don't get that in this new Thief. He just seems like he's brooding a lot.  That being said, I am enjoying myself by playing on Master with waypoint markers turned off. I only use focus to check for traps since it drains so fast on this difficulty. I really like the toggle mini-map. I really like the side-missions. Love all the different arrows, even if some of them are just one-use tools. Visually, the game is gorgeous.  There seems to be ALOT of fanboy hate for this game, and I can understand it. Just look at all the positive reviews people are giving for it and the amount of people voting down on them. Sorry guys, I've learned to appreciate games for what they are, for their own merits, not for what I wanted them to be or wished they played more like.  Is the new Thief a worthy tribute to the series? Yes. Could it have been better? Of course. Is it worth playing? I think so. I'm enjoying it.",

            "review_text": "Where to begin? Allow me to start by saying that this is a worthy sucessor to the Thief franchise, and that despite its flaws it is one of the most remakably fun games I have ever played.   I'm going to forgo what most reviewers seem to do and not compare this game to its predecessors seeing as all of Thief's original designers are long gone.  As for the meat and potatoes of this game, the stealth mechanics are top-notch and spot on. The guards are attentive to enviromental changes (open doors, chests, torches) and have better vision than in previous titles. In fact, moving too quickly even in the darkest shadows will get you spotted (at least on master difficulty). The addition of dogs and birds as security devices is also well-executed and they can pose a severe threat if not properly avoided (I really hate the dogs in this game for their overly sensitive noses :) ). The floor below your feet comes into play with this new edition as scattered broken glass makes a lot of noise when trod on and there is an abundance of pressure-plate activated traps. It took me a few hours to get used to keeping my head down.   I played all the way through on master difficulty with what essentially was the classic thief experience (no objective markers, focus, etc) and it took me upwards of 30 hours without 100% completion. I do believe that a bit more flexibility with the use of rope arrows should have been allowed, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment once I got used to the system. The climbing aspect is a welcome addition in my book as it allows greater freedom of movement which is especially helpful to those looking to ghost the game like the previous titles.  There are about 30 side missions given by various characters in addition to the main storyline as well as many collectibe sets of paintings, jewelry, etc to complete in your spare time between missions (each piece gets lovingly fondled by Garrett upon being picked up). There are many buildings to break into, secrets to discover, and loot to find and I found myself spending more time exploring the city than advancing the plot (I find his to be a god thing). Those with acess to the Bank Heist side mission will be treated to one of the most loving forms of fanservice: a ressurection of the famous bank heist level from Thief 2: The Metal Age complete with camera-like 'eyes.'  Overall I found this game to be amazingly enjoyable and a wonderful change of pace from the other games I play. As for what I think needs to be improved for a possible sequel (pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease), it would be the an improvement to the openness of the levels with more points of ingress to various objectives and allowing the player to visit the whole city from chapter one (I regret to inform you that the only time you'll spend in the noble district is when it's collapsing).   As a whole, this is a solid 8/10 and worthy of both your time and attention with suprisingly few glitches/technical issues (I started playing on day 0 and found exactly one glitch over the 32 hours of gameplay.)  P.S. Focus is for ♥♥♥♥♥es.",

            "review_text": "If time spent on games means or tells you anything, I have 640 hours on this game (I have several Steam accounts, three of which I bought Thief 4). During this time, I have experienced all the not-so-fun hiccups the game has or have had, since its release day (the worst ones were corrected by the developers). At one time, which was insane, your save files would become corrupt and the game would even crash when you tried to save. There are also (rarely) problems with guards not doing what they should, so you can't ghost some parts or chapters of the game 100%. And some chapters will give so called opportunist points, even if you do everything you can to 'ghost'. Also, one piece of loot and 9 documents are missing from the game, and one of the ingame 'thieving objectives' can't be done, simply because the developers missed to include it in the game. There are also some irritating problems with overlapping and desynced dialog.  The story itself is apparently a mixed bag for some. At first, I disliked the 'emo' female character Erin (a victim in too many ways), but now I can certainly like some aspects of her and feel bad for what happened to her (I don't want to spoil it). The music is good and the atmosphere and graphics is better in this game than in any other I have played. Ever.  You can play the game in three different ways: like a true, careful thief with a stealth approach, use the environment to take alternate paths or as a distraction, and to some extent you can just kill your enemies. But it isn't one of those other games where you are always free to get away with being an assassin. You also get a lot of side missions in the game that are often fun and stimulating and you can play challenge maps to earn a good score on the leaderboard. DLC's include an additional (but bad and boring!) challenge map, three (IMO) helpful booster packs and a must-buy: 'The Bank Heist'. Good to quickly get extra gold, but maybe a little too short to stand on its own as something spectacular other than just one of the 'client jobs'.  Overall, I definitely recommend this game. I'm buying it for the third time! (because I'm a nerd who likes to unlock all the achievements again). It seems there are some loud mouthed haters of this game (who can't even accept positive reviews and the fact that a lot of people DO like Thief). So instead of trying to mature and tolerate that people are into different things, they spend their time on spreading hate and lies about the game, and basically telling people they are losers if they like Thief. In any way, I aim to be objective with this review, but I'm a fan of Thief regardless. I'm not a fan of Internet bullies though.  My recommendation is to really try the game out and take it for what it is. Don't compare it to anything else. Just enjoy it! I also highly suggest playing this on PC, because the game looks better and the controls work much better too, on PC than on console and with a controller. It's my strict opinion that Thief is and remains a PC game and porting it doesn't do it justice, even if it's good that as many as possible can play it of course. Even if you don't have a PC (or not a good enough PC to meet the requirements), you should get your own copy of this game. And get immersed, spend some time and patience on it, because that's what it takes! Again, I have played this game for so long, but then I also have the world record time for completing the game on the highest difficulty settings. So called Custom Master. You have a lot of room to develop as a gamer with Thief, being able to build up your skills, patience and confidence. Sorry for sounding like a bad salesman. I mostly just hope you make the right decision for yourself and have fun! :)",

I love true steath games, open ended approach and thinking on your feet style that Thief brought. I know many people did not like this approach to gaming and wanted a more run and gun style and never got into it.   Those kinds of people are probably the ones responsible for the bad reviews. To those Thie fans that feel that the hinting options dumbed it down, by now you know you can turn those off to make it a bit more of a treasure hunt.

So I will give a short answer for all those who hate reading or don't feel like you have the time to read a very detailed fanboy review and then a long answer for those that are curious of the opinion of a person who considers the Thief franchise the greatest single player franchise ever.    Short Answer:    Yes. This game is worth getting. If you're a new comer to the Thief series then this is a game you should check out if you are a fan of the stealth genre. If you're a fan or fanboy of the Thief series, this is worth adding to your collection regardless of if you end up liking it or not so you can complete your collection of Thief games.     Long Answer:   ~~!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!~~ This is where it's going to seem like I'm contridicting myself. It's going to seem like I should by all rights HATE this game by the things I'm going to say. However, I'm going to be intellectually honest and tell you in the same breath, the game is still worth getting and playing. I wouldn't blame you either way if you paid full price for it, or wait until it's on sale. I'll give my list of reasons I feel the game is good with the positives and what I think is wrong with the negatives.    The Positives -   1)  Exquisite Ambiance. When it comes to the actual gameplay, there has never been a game that has sucked me into it's world as much as this one did. When you turn down the lights, crank up the volume you really get an absurd realization of this game. From the city to each and every mission... especially the Moira Asylum!   2)  The addition of new Thief Tools. Your original tools in Thief were basically just lock picks. In addition to the lock picks, there is a wrench, wire cutters and a razor for your thieving adventures. All these are crutial to become successful and to fully experience the game. Each one offers a new unique experience to the game that I found to be an excellent addition.   3)  The Swoop. This is such a cool feature that it makes me want to smash partical board with my testicles in a single thrust! It's a unique ability that gives you a visible / physical sense of what sets you apart from your average thief. It's EXTREMELY useful in almost every situation and in some cases, is not without risk. So use it wisely!   4)  The addition of collectible loot. I just found this to be a cool feature they added. It's a visible accomplishment of your work that gives a sense of accomplishment.    5)  Customization. There is so much customization from the HUD to the difficulties in this game, it's almost overwhelming. You can add everything that's important to your HUD so it's easier for you to keep track of, or make it 100% dedicated to gameplay. As far as the difficulties goes, there are 3. Rogue, Thief and Master all of which adjust the AI of the npc's and also certain restrictions as you increase the difficulty. All 3 of these difficulties can have custom addon's added to any of them. There are too many to list here, but know this, there is quite a few. So if you're looking to personalize your experience, look no further!   6)  Focus Ability. This was another good addition to the game. As with the swoop, this is another visible ability that really helps you feel / understand why you are considered the master thief! This ability highlights area's or objects that might be of interest or things you can interact with. Garrett's ability to recognize things that would be invisible to most others are the stuff of legend. As well as being able to see in the dark far better than others.    7)  Upgrades + replayability. I felt I should include both of those in this one. Because you can't purchase every single upgrade there is in your first playthough. Unless you hack the game, it's just not possible. There are a lot of cool upgrades from weapons to stealth to armor and focus. This game has extremely easy setup for replaying. So when you've earned enough money to upgrade what you wanted. Head right back to the mission you want to play and load it right up with your new stealth boots or massivly powerful bow!    The Negatives -   1)  Not using Stephen Russell for the voice of Garrett! I will   NEVER   forgive Eidos Montreal for this! Their rebuttal for this was they wanted to have a 100% geniune experience of motion capture with the stuntman they used for Garrett. While this is a corporate rebuttal that sounds pretty and looks good on paper, it still holds no weight with me or with purists / true Thief fans. Why? Garrett was never a face. Garrett was a voice... or a shadow with a voice, however you choose to look at it. This is the utmost WORST possible betrayal to the Thief franchise and to us fans of this legendary series.   2)  Bad writing, lip syncing, storyline and very unlikeable characters. The lip syncing in so many cutscenes is just way off which makes it pretty annoying to watch and really pulls you out of the immersion of the game. The storyline was just extremely bad... I don't want to go into too much detail so I don't give away the farm with spoilers. However, the storyline really has no satisfaction where there should be highs and lows. Nothing about this story sucks you into the storyline to give you the rollercoaster of emotions that a good story gives you. The writing in this game creates extremely awkward interactions between characters. You find yourself saying 'Umm... why did she do that? Why did she say that... wait, what???' The closest thing I can equate this feeling of awkwardness to is when you walk up to a random group of people in a social situation, and try to include yourself in their conversation with a lame joke. Or talking to a woman, who's clearly not interested in you or what you have to say, about why you believe Elvis is still alive. The characters emotions and their lines are just... lame. Between the bad audio that overlaps other audio and the bad lines each characters are given, instead of getting normal dialogue, you end up listening to a symphony of weirdos. The main character Garrett is very noticibly inexperienced and, I dare say, a grade B voice actor.    3)  We were lied to. Eidos Montreal said in several interviews that they were trying to stay as true to the original series as possible. If you played the original games or know anything about the original games, you'll quickly realize how much of a bold faced lie that was. I imagine it is the similar feeling that you would have when your wife tells you that you are the only man she's ever been with. Then when your baby is born, it's a different color. It turns out that there are bits and pieces of the original game spread out as... I guess you can call them cameos? They kept the names of some of the original characters, Garrett, Basso, Erin... You see a hammer on a cathedral, a tip of the hat to the old hammerites. Out of 183 hours of gameplay I heard the word 'Taffer' twice from listening to random conversations near windows. There is a drunk by the name of 'Lenny', an indirect homage to the old character 'Benny'. The Trickster was mentioned one time by Garrett. Without playing the original games, nobody knows who the f*** the trickster is, which is another example of the bad writing, because it makes people go 'Who? Wait... did I miss something? Who is the trickster?' While there are a handful of others, the point is, nothing about this game is 'true to the old series' like we were told. Utterly disgraceful.   4)  New game mechanics. Gives a clostrophobic and linear feel to the game. Like your hand is being held and told exactly where to go. While I do not dislike these new mechanics, I perfer the old mechanics better.   Well I'm out of room to type. I didn't realize I had limited characters. There is a ton more I could say, so feel free to add me to find out more.",

After Looking Glass was absorbed/dissolved/disbanded/exploded whatever, it was thought we'd never see another good Thief or System Shock title again. Although the Bioshock series (particularly the first one) had been applauded for being the 'spiritual successor' to System Shock 2 to the point of ad nauseam (not entirely justified either if you ask me); there had been nothing for the Thief series. Granted there was Deadly Shadows, but even ex-members of Looking Glass being part of Ion Storm couldn't change the fact that it was missing something. Maybe it was the 3rd person perspective? Console to PC port? Whatever the reason is, it missed the mark ever so slightly - but I digress.  In the simply titled Thief we are finally back in the shoes of Garrett sneaking around town relieving the 1% of their trinkets. The world which he inhabits is rich and detailed as are the various ways one can get around; whether it be rooftops or streetlevel. Noticeable improvements have been made to AI in relation to their awareness and detection as well as methods to avoid/distract enemies and victims. But the thing that really shines for me is the storytelling through inner dialogue and voice acting and audio in general; and the atmosphere... whew... I remember crapping my pants during those zombie missions in The Dark Project - and for this one the Asylum is doing the same. Some may think 'how is that different from the originals?', simply put - it's not. That's the beauty of it, they've somehow captured all the elements that worked in the first two games all the while bringing the graphics and technology up to speed.

The City is supposedly plagued by a strange disease that makes people go mad. You eventually discover the origins of this disease and put an end to it. There's not much else to the backstory, though. Except the Thief-Taker General, and I shouldn't even talk about him. Oh, and there's Garrett's old friend Erin. Cons: Clunky controls, very linear gameplay (you can't even jump, and the few places you can climb at are simply routes you'll eventually have to take), a weird plot, and the absolutely horrific AI. Pros: Great graphics; especially the shadow and lighting-based textures, decent level design (if a bit linear), some attention to story. Oh, and the stealthy gameplay, if you like it. It's just that as I mentioned the controls are a tad clunky. Stealing stuff from seemingly empty houses is fun too. Some of the sidequests are worth doing. Overall, provides hours of entertainment and if you're willing to overlook the flaws it can be a nice experience.",

Worth it for a couple of coins.....  Utterly stupid thing is opening a indow that just happens to be a loading  area......what?  Stupid.  so ultimately yes, this game isn't perfect, it's good looking, the voice acting is a bit pants.

The fun part is finding all the treasures and hidden things. Only downfall in regard to that is, it all seems too easy, even if you turn Focus off. And it seems like the rewards should be bigger. Especially with some finds where you went all out of the way and decrypted, opened and all you find are two measley gold knives and a pen? Really? Perhaps more upgrades to the weapons and armor would be better? And as far as decoding and lock picking as well, that seems all too easy. But I think what does it for me at least, is the overall atmosphere and slow pace which I enjoy. You can run through every objective sure and finish the game in maybe 2 hours plus. But there is no fun in that for me and I like exploring all the areas and taking my time. Definitely fun to do.",

Anyway, for $6ish for the special edition I decided to give it a shot. I enjoy it for the most part, yes you have to get past some bad dialog, but the game mechanics are were it shines. I have not played the original three Thief titles so I am coming at it with a fresh perspective. I also usually don't play the stealth/infiltration titles so even though this game isn't usually in my wheel house, I am enjoying it so far.

Story - The story wasn't the greatest, though it was still enjoyable. At times, the story progression didn't make a lot of sense, and left me wondering what was going on. However, I still found it to be fairly enjoyable.    Gameplay  - The gameplay consists of sneaking around beautifully designed levels and looting valuables to buy equipment. In addition, you create distractions to sneak past guards and various other enemies who could easily kill you if you aren't stealthy enough. Unlike in some other stealth games, such as Dishnored, you shouldn't try to take on enemies unless you have the element of surprise, and not take on more than one enemy at a time in melee range. Doing otherwise will quickly lead to your death.   Verdict  - If you enjoy  stealth  games with aesthetically pleasing level design, this may be the game for you. Though the story can be a tad lacking at times, the game is still very fun in my opinion. Therefore, I advise against letting the flaws in the story keep you from experiencing what is an otherwise very enjoyable game.  ",

No. You use your skills and a wide range of arrows to create paths in order to move around.  -The dark atmosphere of the 'City' is fantastic.  -The stealth system is good and high game difficulties can be a real challenge.  What blew it, however, at least for me, was the endless loading screens you had to get through in order to travel in The City. The City - the world - is divided in small areas in which, to get from A to D you have to face:   A &gt; Travel for 20 sec - reach gate, game pauses, get asked if you want to proceed to next area &gt; 30 sec Loading Screen &gt; B &gt; Travel for 20 sec - reach gate, game pauses, get asked if you want to proceed to next area &gt; 40 sec Loading Screen &gt; C &gt; Travel for 20 sec - reach gate, game pauses, get asked if you want to proceed to next area &gt; 30 sec Loading Screen &gt; D &gt; Finally Arrived.  This, for me, ruined the momentum. Although small pauses, they were distracting me from really focusing on the game - couldn't the City be 'one?' Just one large (well, medium) map?

And then there is someone like myself who seeks a game that is generally good, regardless whether it is a reboot of the previous one. Despite all that, Thief has a very unique gameplay in which you can approach in two different ways: you either fight your way through missions like in most single player games or if you are a stealth purist like myself, you can stick to the shadows like Garrett should-which is more rewarding and challenging.   However doing so can eventually become frustrating. To counteract that, the game has the option to change the difficulty to suit a specific play style. As well as this, there is a wide range of aspects that give you the incentive to keep on playing such as: mastering the art of lock picking, discovering collectables scattered around in missions, using different arrow tips such as water arrows to put out fires or blunt arrows to trigger mechanisms and of course, completing missions completely undetected. Not only this, but the main story is well structured and you become hooked on the story. The side missions are not as heavily based on this but offer desirable rewards to give you an incentive to complete them. Or if you prefer, you can leave the side missions to the end so that you revisit some areas.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this game to those who are up for a challenge and enjoy following a story in an immersive first-person open world. 9.5/10",

The campaign is fairly short - the side missions are a little too easy and without depth but that's not to say it's not a well put together game.  The stealth aspects are awesome and this one of those games I really felt the need to be stealthy. You don't HAVE to, but it's difficult to fight your way out of situations. The game is much more rewarding relying on stealth and it's kind of the point. The stealth mechanics are strong and the game environments and situations lend itself to some exciting methods of getting around.  However - why do I need to pry windows open on the way in AND out. Going in and out of windows is such a chore.  Why does every narrow passage way have a giant beam to spam E on to get by - this also is a chore and a dumb mechanic.   Jumping to ropes is also clumsy, I felt to my death many times because Garret opted to just jump down instead or grabbing the rope.  Yes, lots of the repetitive mechanics are dumb - some variation is surely needed in the likely sequel.   However critism aside I had a blast with this game. The highlight being the Asylum. I haven't been this terrified by a video game in my life - though I do avoid the horror genre I think this game is worth a run through just for that chapter. Remember to look side to side when lock picking in the Asylum, expect to ♥♥♥♥ bricks when you see it.  I can recommend this game and would say it's totally worth a run through. You'll probably only get 10 hours or so out of it though unless you're hell bent on finding all the loot. You'll probably kill yourself before you do though thanks to some of the annoying mechanics.",

Compared to earlier installments it's somewhat less open but gameplay is straightend out and fluent. I recommend to make use of the vast options to individualize gameplay and hud the developers offer to create the kind of game you want to play and give it a go. It comes with typical problems of the stealth genre like repetitive monologs of npcs and somewhat unrealistic hiding mechanics (you are hidden in shadows). Other than that the atmosphere is excellent and the interaction with the world was pulled of in a immersive manner that is top notch for a first person game. My biggest complaints are that there are some third person climbing sequences that don't fit in quite well and the characterdesign of garret is a little overdone in terms of clothing and style.",

When I first played it it did indeed seem like a convulted mess of a city, the game play was questionable because you couldn't 'climb everything' and the story line was abrupt in the end. Well the end of the storyline I can't defend against, but the rest is HOGWASH!!   Thief 4, the newest installment, also simply known as Thief, is a brilliant game. You have to THINK like a thief in a world that is a bit more powerful than you. That means you have to use your wits, speed, memory, intelligence, tools and shadows to survive properly. You have to be able to read people to know where they are going, and throw something, make a sound somewhere else to make them go where you will not be. You have to know how to move from spot to spot without being seen, and if you are know how to get the 'F' outta there!! You have to know what can be transversed by thinking that you don't have the power of a Creed loving Assassin. You got a special eye if you want to make things bit smoother, but if you use your brain, you can use minimal or none of those skills at all, but what thief isn't good at increasing his combat to level 2 and knocking out a guard with a CRITICAL STRIKE!!!? Ask Locke Cole from Final Fantasy. The city does seem like a mess, doesn't it?? But a good thief is good on reconisense, and that means being able to know where EVERYTHING is, making a blueprint of the world around him and only using the map when absolutely necessary. And that is rare, cause you have a perfect memory, non? The tools are aquired early to get the big pieces quickly and get more money, then you cycle, rinse, wash, repeat until you have so much volume money that you can buy all the arrows you need!! Lastly, the name Thief Taker General? There is a book called 'The Lies of Locke Lamora' where little orphans are trained into being thieves by a guy named the Thief Maker General, so the opposite of him is a play on words by Edios.  It's a game as sneaky as the protagonist, so get used to what you don't understand. Or you will think you were robbed from a game that is actually quite a steal in itself.   -Locces LeBeau",

The custom difficulty settings allow you to make this the game you've always wanted. Do not want to kill anyone? Great, there's a option for that. Want to end a mission if you're discovered? Great, you can do that. Focus meter? Don't need it? Don't have to have it. Die and start the game over? Yep, there's an option for that too. My first run I disabled combat killing, harming civillians, and checkpoint saves only. I had a throughly good time with this game and fans of old school Thief shouldn't worry, you may not like the game as it is, but you can change it.   You will absolutely enjoy this game if you played any of the previous Thief games, especially if you felt games like DIshonoered or even Deus Ex Human Revolution didn't have enough stealth in them. Nothing beats the feeling of sneaking past hordes of guards and watchmen to steal items (even gold from their own wallets) and getting away undetected. The story isn't very well put to gether, but that doesn't take away from the gameplay at all.   If you haven't played a stealth or Thief game before, this is a great place to start. Many of the customizable options are just for you, though you can't disable them without restarting your campaign.  Minor detractors: Minor bugs with sound did not ruin the play, but did take away from the atmosphere. NPC dialog didn't have a ton of variation. Stealth works exactly as you imagine, but some of the later levels punish you for deviating from combat in any capacity.  Enjoy this: True stealth gameplay, customizable campaign, callbacks to previous games.   Steam Badge enabled. TF2 preorder bonuses were cool, thanks Valve + Squenix",

I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and to be honest I did read the reviews and I respectfully have to say most of them were expecting something different, this is not Assassins Creed, this is not Dishonered, This is Thief, its a pure Stealth game and it is encouraged to avoid combat at all costs, there is ways to make combat a viable option if you use sawtooth arrows and make sure to do it quickly, because as soon as you kill someone you are guarenteed to alert an entire mob, which will ultimately lead to your death if your not fast enough to deal with the situation, Me personally I preffered using a stealthy approach and only killing when I thought it was absolutely necessary, some people didnt need to kill at all and beat the game on master and other custom settings, im afraid I only played on Thief difficulty which is basically Normal difficulty.  The stealth mechanics are fantastic, you use the lighting to your advantage and even shadows and actual civilians, for example I had to get past a decent amount of guards and I managed to sneak past them by hiding behind a woman that was patrolling the same area as well. The game does a good job of delivering a great atmosphere, that is Dark, depressing but also quite awesome in the fact that the music always fits the situations and the different sounds you hear in the music tracks and the in-game sounds help to create a dark and mysterious city to explore. Speaking of exploration I found that extremely fun, moving around the city and finding secret areas was always incredibly rewarding, as there was always different things in the houses to mix it up. such as using a bow to open a window by hitting a button inside the house from the outside, dealing with traps that had been set up to ward you away from the games loot, and sometimes even patrolling guards would be hanging about in these areas to make it a little bit extra challenging to get to the Safe in the house or a special painting. The games story however is my problem with the game, there just isnt enough dialogue in the game so it feels like a lot of things are just left unexplained and it did take away a little bit from the overall experience, by the 2nd half of the story things do pick up but its still not enough, there should have been more dialogue in the game, rather than having to work certain things out ourselves, so that the game tells a more engaging story sadly this game doesnt have it. Overall I would rate this game an 8/10 I loved most of what I played and the only real drawback for me was the story, This is not a perfect game by any imagination but for me it delivered Great Graphics and Controls and some really neat gameplay in a world where gaming is pretty much on its backside in terms of finding games that really seperate themselves from the pack, This game however does that with its unique setting and fantastic Stealth mechanics.",

That was my initial approach to the game and I certainly received a backlash for it. Even though taking on an offensive playstyle to get through the whole game is possible, it is not the most smoothest course to get through it. The cutscenes weren't as amazing as I expected it to be. The name of the game is challenge, so you'll be seeing yourself reloading a save to retry after a failure over and over again, and this is true for even the normal mode as compared to the harder extreme game modes. All in all, I'd say that this game requires one to be extremely patient on top of being strategic in knowing when is the right opportune moment to strike an enemy, so if you're the type who is up for that kind of challenge, then this game is for you.",

That being said, this game is a stealth game, and it is very good at being a stealth game. Furthermore, while any comparison drawn to Dishonored isn't entirely unreasonable, Dishonored makes you a wizardy assassin, rather than, say, a sneaky rogue without the ability to teleport at will, leaving options limited and more grounded, but, altogether, leaving a solid game, that I have been enjoying for the most part. While glitches do exist, they are adequately limited that they are livable, and the only game affecting one that I have noticed went away with haste, and was a simple matter of AI pathing, rather than something actually game breaking.

PROS -stunning graphics with crisp textures, detailed environments, and good lighting -tons of exploration -stats on all levels that are accessible at any point in the game -customizable difficulty and hud elements -'collectible' loot sets -bonus mission achievements -player skill and equipment improvements -aerial takedowns -unlike predecessors, can only jump when effective, so as not to create noise from failed jumps -'swooping' is fun and useful  CONS -expansive but linear missions that don't allow backtracking to find all secrets. forced replay? -tedious but somewhat infrequent quick-time events -inexplicably inconsistent and limited saving leaves you frequently either unable to return to a specific part of a mission or redoing long sections because of one screw-up -unusual sound positioning causes some sounds (especially dialogue) to seem like they're closer than they are -occasional crashing -guard NPCs sometimes get stuck in place from loads, interrupted conversations, or disturbances -consolitis buy/sell interface -boss fights and action sequences that have no place in a thief game -the amount of clutter and environmental detail makes the focus mechanic a necessity -dumbed-down light levels mean you're either completely visible or mostly invisible -arbitrary lore and voice actor changes -cliche asylum mission that tries to be 'The Cradle' from Thief 3; starts creepy but ends weird -meh music with little variety",

It's 100% easier all of the time to never be detected, and the game provides you with plenty of ways of getting this done.  I even enjoyed the open city parts too! Nothing more fun than sneaking over rooftops and swinging into an open window, then to sneak off with a good sack of gold and booty :p Yes there are moments in the game that made me want to rip my hair out in anger and frustration, but those were only moments where I was trying to rush through. It's a slow game and meant to be taken slowly, if you rush the gameplay then your going to ruin it... and waste your own money from buying the game.

However I must say that this game is excellent. If I could sum up the experience of playing Garrett in one word it'd be ATMOSPHERE. This game has outstanding atmosphere accompanied by sound design and gameplay elements, I've not been so immeresed in a stealth game in years!  Thief is a balls to the wall steath game. Sure you could go in and try to kill/knockout everyone but that's not a challenge, and the game will let you know that. You're not rewarded for being a baddass night assasin; instead you're a ghost sneaking in and out without having to knock out guards or kill them truely leaving no trace of your having been there save for empty pockets and missing trinkets. Difficulty is extremely customizable, for example let's say you don't want to have access to a map, or maybe no ammo counters, or how about no visability meters, scratch that no hud at all, thief let's you do all that and more with extensive GUI/HUD options and difficulty options.   Optimization wise this game runs like butter, I by no means have a high end righ my graphics card is a GTX 650ti Boost SSC by evga, and I play on ultra maintaining around 30-45 fps. All settings can be changed outside of the game in the launcher and can be changed in realtime in game without having to restart the the game, Seperate audio sliders, Benchmarking tool you name it and this game pretty much has. My only real performance problem has to be with the cut scenes for some odd reasons the in engine renders are at a much lower fps than the actual game runs at. This is apperently a well known issue and is being addressed so hopefully we'll see a patch to reslove this issue.    In closing: Thief Looks great and plays tight, with outstanding atmosphere and immersive diaglogues and collectables be warned you will loose hours stalking the money lined pockets of watchmen and hunting down every last bit of loot available.",

            "review_text": "I like so many others had been looking forward to the Thief relaunch for a long time with both great anticipation and daunting dread. Gaming has changed so fundamentally since the 90's that there was no doubt in my mind that any profit seeking entity would 'modernize' the title with a heavy hand. Looking Glass Studios who created one of the most immersive gaming experiences in the orginal game  Thief the Dark Project  (not to mention System Shock 1&amp;2 (especially 2)), left behind some great big shoes to fill in the form of fan expectations. Being Garrett lonewolf master thief observing from the shadows, taking his time and avoiding conflict by avoiding detection, the duality of being superior in ones element and weak, almost helpless out of it was what made the game. Garrett is no fighter any typical guard presents a monumental foe in a fair fight. That makes Garrett an atypical anti-hero, which was/is so refreshing and so risky, did Square Enix make Garrett more of a modern killing machine?  The Square Enix version. First of all I would like to say that I'm also a fan of several Square Enix titles and have many in my Steam library. I'll start by mentioning things I dislike in Thief:  -Bugs there are quite a few. A lot of people have performance issues. There are odd issues with the guards sometimes freeze in place making the game easier or impossible depending on where they freeze. Once you load the game they start moving again, sometime you dont know if the guards are really suposed to be moving or not so you are not getting the correct gaming experience... Another bug I had was when I saved while standing in a doorway with the door open when I loaded the game I was stuck inside the door unable to move, the savegame was useless. I also get strange flickering. There are many more bugs reported. So far it's playable though, still quite infuriating but nothing new in this industry that publishers force developers to launch an unfinished product. Lets hope for good and swift patches!  -Claw gadget for climbing. New maneuvering tool a claw thingie which pretty much has been made up only so that the there is some reason why you can climb in only the places where the level design wants you to climb. Hillarious when you stand on the street and there is some loot about 2meters up on a protruding piece of lumber on a wall of a house. There is no way for you to reach it even though the wall looks like one of those climbing walls on the playground and a soft gamer like me could easilly scale it IRL... Instead to get the loot you have to go around somwhere...  -Lack of jump sometimes makes for some ridiculous situations when for example a pipe on the ground can stop a strapping young master thief with the dexterity of a cheetah in his tracks...   -Rope arrow was kinda the ace inte sleeve before, didn't find a way to progress? Start looking for where a rope arrow might help. Rope arrows could be shot freely on wooden surfaces. Now there are blue tinted specific/obvious places to shoot the rope arrow. The whole thing is just another form of control from level design over the player...  -The levels are beautiful and I'm sure that designers have spent a lot of time on each and every room to make them individual. Even so I'd argue that the level design is lazy. The game tries hard to make it feel like you have options of how to progress. In truth you are being lead by leash all along.  -The main character has changed. Garrett the quintessential loner, introvert, sarcassm spewing, hater of establishment, outsider who likes it that way. Does the things he does because he feels like it not because others ask/tell him. He is equiped with unfaltering selfesteem and hes motivation is money or just pure challenge not helping and he most assuredly allways works alone! Not so in this time. Also the voice actor has changed (which I'm sure everyone is aware of), in a FPS the voice is kinda a big deal especially in a game where you didn't really interact with that many other characters.  -The story makes no sense... I feel as though they've tried too hard or something... In this case less would have been more... Any time there is amnesia involved (like pretty much every rpg ever) I feel like its a bit of a copout... While playing I really don't care about the story at all.  -Guard dialogues used to be great fun to listen to and still are in some cases, its just that the writing on average is not good and some of it is ludicrously moronic. Another problem is that sometimes the guards keep saying the same thing over and over with not even a pause in between, I hope this is a bug that they'll fix.   -New features. Swoop is a way to move quickly forward for a short distance. I'm personally a bit conflicted about it on one hand it is a good add to a stealth game on the other hand there was no such thing in the original game. Focus is basically the forced RPG element to the game, now days it seems that every game needs some form of 'character development'. I don't agree and would argue that many games would be better without. Focus is also some kind of x-ray vision superpower which you can activate too see how mechanisms work or what in the room is useable. Focus is the best example of modernization.  If you can overcome the before mentioned things and not shutdown the game in anger and disapointment. You will find a very entertaining stealth game in an intesting universe. Dark and dirty early industrial metropolitan with sinister semi-supernatural flavourings and smattering of really amoral and downright evil people. The athmosphere is good and that is a rare thing in my oppinion. I'd give this game 85/100, add 5 points (90/100) for diehard fans of stealth games and deduct 5 points (80/100) for diehard fans of the original Thief game. I'd recommend this game.  (This game is a victim of consolification. Games are developed for consoles and console controllers. They are then ported with too little optimization to controls and performance. Also things like 'preorder gifts' and day one DLC's are uncool... )",

The Light Gem, treasures everywhere and a feeling of ultimate stealth keep this game in line with the series. It opts to branch out to a bit more of combat as an option, though I never found this effective and I enjoyed the variety of ways to move around The City and its various levels.  It falls short at the end, in my opinion. The last level feels exceptionally linear with a sharp spike in difficulty for various stealth desires. The story closure feels... weird, in my opinion (but that point is especially an opinion). Not unlike Human Revolution, Eidos' other baby, this game's ending felt a little rushed and didn't quite hold up to the classics many know and love.  Still, after the end you can continue to pursue side quests (of which there are plenty) and treasure hunting. The unique treasures that can be displayed in your safehouse give a great feeling of depth in how far you want to fill out the game, more so than a 'x/100%' counter. The ambiance of the environment is top-notch; anyone who can run this game on near-max settings should further play in the dark with a headset. It's very easy to get immersed into the stealth, the fear, the tension, the joy of success. The game will throw a few curveballs (no spoilers) that may take veteran Thieves out of their comfort zone but it's only temporary and fits the point of the game.  Absolutely recommend for any stealth lovers. Take the end with a grain of salt, enjoy the rest of the game in its entirety.",

Sometimes, I felt like the game was clearly pushing me to take a certain path. That said, the levels in the second half of the main game had great atmosphere and were reasonably challenging. The side missions are nice sections where your goal is to find a certain object and basically loot as many things as you can (which is also something that you generally do A LOT OF in the game overall).

Additionally, the bonus bank mission can be completed in minutes based on its teeny tiny size, and it isn't a 'challenge' map as they hint at. The levels are smaller and more linear than expected, but the city hub is HUGE and offers tons of puzzles, secrets, exploration, and loot. The main story offers a slow and intriguing build that abruptly ends as if they ran out of money while making the final cut scene. While the ending was extremely underwhelming, the side missions and city dialogue, along with hundreds of notes and conversations really added a great atmosphere to the game. At times this game feels like a masterpiece. At other times it falls short. I hesitate to say it lacks polish because its a gorgeous game that is full of lovingly created detail. But some decisions and some shortsightedness really drag the overall feel of the game down. A decent patch would fix most of the issues of this game. Its M rating is much more drastic than the previous 3 Thief titles. The new adult content doesn't seem to fit this universe IMHO.

The soundtrack, as well as ambient music and sounds, are absolutely fantastic. Coupling the two factors of gorgeous visuals and captivating audio makes for an incredibly immersive experience.  A rather obvious disappointment that will arise for fans of the first games in the Thief series is that Thief (2014)'s game world feels far less organic and alive than its predecessors. The main location of the game, The City, is an abundance of homes and buildings that the player may pilfer for all sorts of loot. The problem is that most of these buildings are without any NPCs to occupy or guard them, making the experience of being a true thief feel more like something along the lines of a looter. (With the exception of major quest areas which are bustling with life.)  All things considered, Thief delivers an immersive and enjoyable stealth experience better than most other games in the genre, it has a moderate story that is more than capable of lasting upwards of 15 hours for a single completionist playthrough, and it's visually and audibly pleasing.  If you come from games like Dishonored, Splinter Cell, or Deus Ex; then it's likely that Thief will provide you with an enjoyable albeit unmemorable experience.",

It's more set up to challenged yourself on each mission, going undetected or just killing everyone.  Worth the $8 if you grab it on sale. Plently of things to do.

It delivers a beautiful atmospheric environment with fantastic visuals. With that said, you will need a pretty high-end configuration to run the game to it's potential. The world is huge! Thus more exploring and looting is encouraged. The story is good, but rather confusing. With that said, the chapters have a long duration so you can expect to accumulate a good amount of hours just by completing the story alone. There are plenty of side missions for you to tackle, but most of them revolve around looting and it will get quite tedious. It is suggested that you should get familiar with the city so you can get to a location without having to traverse to a wrong area. In order to replay missions, you will need to make your way back to the location where you first started the mission. Overall, this is a great game, it makes you think twice before you advance forward. If you don't enjoy repeating the same routine over and over again (in this case, looting.) Then you will probably not enjoy this game. But, if you enjoyed the previous games in the franchise, enjoyed stealth-oriented games, and are content with collecting more gold, then you should add this game to your Steam Library. I recommend!",

The graphics are nice, the stealthing is nice, the voice-acting is good, the animations are fluid but it's just not like the original games.  The story is generic, the writing is amateur, and it is somewhat linear even with a semi-open hub world you can explore. It does hold your hand with waypoints and the threat indicators, but there is a twist.  The game is FILLED with customization options. Not for the graphics, but there's a custom difficulty that allows you to change the game mechanics. If you want to you can completely turn off any sort of waypoint, health bar, threat indicator, and even turn off your light gem. It is nice to have some customization to change up what is your standard (somewhat) butchering series reboot.  It's in no way a bad game, but it's a bad Thief game. Go in cautiously.",

The connections between the main characters (e.g. Erin and Garrett) are weak also. I may think this because I generally found Erin to be quite dislikable. However, the engine is excellent, the game looks great in terms of graphical fidelity, and the side characters are well-made and entertaining. One thing the game must be commended for is Chapter Five. I have played  Outlast  and  Amnesia: The Dark Descent , and the   Moira Asylum   chapter of this game easily scared me to the extent those games did. This can be attributed to the fact that it's not a game you expect to contain horror elements, and thus their inclusion was great.

This was a massive mistake on my part, I had no idea how hooked I was about to become. In finally picking up and playing the game it took me a little bit to get used to the environment and navigating around this world. Unlike games like Skyrim where you can just blitz everywhere in sneak mode, Thief seems to have a more sensitive detection system really forcing the player to utilize shadows, slower movements, and distractions to remain undetected.  The texture pack is amazing, they really focused on environment and shadows which is crucial for this style of game play. The over all engine and game play runs really smooth. It took me a little bit to get used to the controls, obviously they can be re-mapped but I wanted to see how it would play mapped at default and it seems to be going smooth.  After playing this game for extended periods of time my mind tends to hurt, the game requires an intense amount of focus and attention to detail as shadows are constantly changing. I have found that moving around the environment is very much 3D. There are multiple ways to get around you just have to really look around. There are also plenty of hidden secrets and treasures so exploration is encouraged and rewarded.  I ran it in 2K on a 27' screen no problem.  Enjoy guys!

I own them all (already before Steam was invented) and still got every huge Eurobox standing next to me. I had much fun with them and I played Thief-the dark project like 30 times. (After writing this review I started again to play the trilogy...*cough*)  Now a new Thief was released. And what shall I say?  It looks pretty? It takes the stealth-genre to a new level? It will become one of the best games of all times? NOPE! It is... a betrayal to all fans and Looking Glass Studios is surely rotating in it's grave...  Gameplay: This game is way to easy. The guards that shall defeat you are dumb as nuts. Oh, don't forget they might see you from time to time through a solid wall and kill you without seeing them.  This game is so small... Smaller than a birdcage. The levels of the three earlier titles were huge. Amazingly huge and you were able to go (almost) everywhere. And now I try to go somewhere else than developers want me to in their linear-levels? Nope! I even can't jump where I want!  Fighting has become 'Smash X as hard as you can, motherxxxxer'. That's it. nothing more. Oh wait, you have a bow. And you get special reward for headshots (Chapter 1). SERIOUSLY? If you are a thief, shouldn't you try to avoid drawing attention? And steal as much as you can? And I mean STEAL something, not just ink.....   Another huge dissappopintment are the enemy units. There are guards, several types of guards (some have a torch, some a sword and some a bow, few a good armor). And some creepy guys (which they are is not clearly explained in my eyes). Those creatures ruin the atmosphere of some levels. And that's pretty it. Also the talk of the guards are constantly repeating. Funny for the first moment, it goes boring after hearing it fir the tenth time.  And well... just look, we have a minimap (a point I consequently find irritating already in 'Thief - deadly shadows'). This game takes place in which era? Seriously, they have just invented electrical light and Garret already uses radar...? (as Always, Garret is/was ahead of his time....)  Technical: What made the Thief-series so famous were their footsteps. Yes, their footsteps. You were able to hear where an enemy was, which ground he walks AND he was also able to hear YOU! In this game... footsteps? Oh and well you can't even hear if someone is a mile away or stands right behind you. So the sound is a complete mess.  Another point I might add: music. The background music. Too electronic and soulless in my eyes. Doesn't fit in many situations, but that is just my opinion. WUB WUB WUB! Need I say more?  Also I was confronted by several bugs and glitches. Not even fixed yet (four months after release). A disgrace. Game seems not to have been finished. Seriously?  Graphics... the game looks good. Still don't know why the game needs to load every 10 meters.  Story: Wait.... there is no actual story. This is... I don't even know what I should say without cursing and swearing. It's not even a spoiler, when I say: Energy crisis=&gt; Magical stone explodes =&gt; your girl gets affected by explosion =&gt; look for her =&gt; find her =&gt; she dies? (The ending is just... CUT! Open end, wait for the next title!) =&gt; FIN.  Conclusion: This is no stealth-game or even a THIEF-game. This is a disgrace to fans of the series.    Shame on you, Eidos. shame on you. ",

Sadly, in this particular case, the mark has been missed by an incredible amount. The game is beautiful, and the aesthetic is very well-realized. Beyond that, it's a travesty. The story is a mess: either they cut out a sizable portion of it or they changed the story at the last minute and struggled to make the existing pieces fit the new narrative. Either way, it's a hodgepodge of half-baked ideas and huge leaps of narrative logic. The sound design is all over the place, with characters being far too quiet in cutscenes, over-repeated incidental dialogue from NPCs, and sound positioning seems to be wrong most of the time.   I wanted to love the game, as while there are quite a number of stealth action games, very few really focus on the experience of being a master thief: sneaking around and stealing things. Most focus on assassination or some other kind of objectives. While it doesn't meet the criteria of playing a thief, I still would highly recommend you play Dishonoured instead of this if you're looking for a great Thief-like, even if it primarily concerns itself with being a sneaky killer more than a sneaky stealer.",

The attention to some of the important details of the Legacy titles of this franchise have been lost on this very shody attempt at fame and glory by taking 16 and 14 year old works of art and completely destroying the well laid out foundations by trying to make it something it wasn't. This is worse than Assassins creed. The developers would have been better off calling this game something else and changing the characters names and just left it as that.   They've gone as far as making Thief 3 look really good comparatively as far as sticking to tried and true mechanics. The dynamic difficulty settings, where you can change how limiting the difficulty is, is a cop-out by the dev's lack of imagination and abilities to create something true to the series, something unique, something next generation. This game is only next-gen graphically, and by that I mean next gen from Thief 3, not next gen for Consoles or PC.   You'll largely be disappointed with what is about a 10 hour playthrough.

Combat music - (Music can be disabled, but for some of the decent tracks that there are...)  Objectives - Mission parameters aren't always clear. (I.E You can't knock out civilians, if you do, you fail. but it doesn't tell you this until you do it. )   Clunky combat - Previous titles Garrett had a Sword or a Dagger. Killing in close quarters was always the -players choice-, not the games. You can kill people with a bow, but you can't keep it drawn in close combat if they hit you. In this game you either have to run or try and clobber the guards to death with your blackjack while trying to clumsily dodge their blades or their projectile weapons. Running is the only option unless you're cornered somewhere.. which again.. is limited by the fact that you can't actively jump whenever you want to.   Voice Acting / Audio execution - It's not that the voice actors themselves are bad. The sound mechanics take what might have been an intriguing narrative and make it difficult to actually care about it. This is coming from a regular speaker 5.1 speaker system on a high grade sound card, and a high end set of headphones. Also there is an annoying sound que when a guard is getting notice of you in their peripheral vision.  The second part of this is that there's no environmental effects on voices... it literally sounds like the actors are standing right next to you the whole time, even if they're down on the streets below you or a door or two between you. Which to me makes the game feel very tacky and unfinished.   Music - Again leaves more than a lot to be desired. It tries to make a slow paced Genre feel more fast paced, and it's just not. Listen to some of the previous games soundtracks and then listen to the sound track from this game. The difference is worlds apart, and the soundtrack for Thi4f falls short. Even without comparison to the previous games, it does little to augment the environment of the city streets or the subtleties of sneaking about some mansion or many of the shortcut areas Garrett comes across.   Cut-scenes - Yes there have been cutscenes before, but in this it can't make up it's mind if it wants you to get lost in the first person perspective or run it like you're watching some kind of movie in the third. The cut-scenes look great but... the execution again is fairly disappointing. I found myself wanting it to make up its mind on the perspective, it falls short.   Over all story arc - Written by the same woman who wrote Tomb Raider. Which if you slapped some torn pants and a tank top up on Garrett, it'd almost be hard to tell the difference in the overall plot.   Garrett's look - A mask? He's a ninja now? Eye liner/ eye shadow? In general, Garrett feels like he's been womanized. He can't fight, he's wearing eye shadow and a mask, and he complains too much. The witty reserved anti-hero of yore is gone. Replaced with... Lara-ett.    And for those of you who are piping in on my play time on steam, PC isn't the only platform Thief is out on.",

There simply are not enough things to do, or enough ways to do them in; both the stealth aspect and the combat aspects are too limited. Many of the things you can do are boring or a bogged down in unnecessary animations (window climbing animation I’m look at you. First time is boring enough, 15th time you wanna kill someone).   2. The story and the characters are generally boring and predictable. The hero has very little personality and the villain even less. The world seem interesting, but is barely presented more than “oh the city is so bad… so bad… really bad I promise.”  3. There are not enough reasons to explore. There is constantly an arrowing pointing you in the right direction so you’ll never really have to look for the way. And the loot and secrets you can find… why bother? It’s just money and you don’t need money to progress. Unless you’re a completionist there is no point.   4. I was considering sticking it out to see what happens, but why? I’m not enjoying the gameplay and I’m not enjoying the story. I think I’ll just stop here (about halfway, finished the 4th chapter).   I’d avoid buying.",

After watching my other beloved stealth series, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, turn to hell, I was desperately wishing the same wasn't true for Thief. I desperately wanted to play this game and find out that all the negative reviews were inaccurate, and that the few positive reviews that claimed all the haters were just playing on the easy difficulty. I desperately wanted to believe that cranking up all the difficulty settings and removing all the visual aids would actually matter. But everything the haters said came to be the truth. In a great stealth game, patience is essential for perfection and spending 3 hours on one mission is completely acceptable if it leads to that 100% stealth rating. In a great stealth game, like the older Thiefs or Splinter Cell 1-4, the more slow and careful I am, the more fun I am having and the more immersed I am.   In this game, the longer you take, the more ugly flaws you realize in the mission design and it kills the stealth experience. Guards are literally on a non-stop patrol loop, repeating the exact same actions and phrases over and over without ever throwing something new at you. Everything looks and sounds great at first glance, the lighting is undeniabely good, but at a closer look it is never that impressive. How can a master thief like Garrett not be able to do anything about a store that is 'closed'? A 'closed' sign should be a signal that I can go inside and steal stuff, but not in this game. The only places that are accessible have a great big orb shining on them so you'll have no problem finding where to go. It is horrible level design.   I wanted to get immersed into this game with my ridiculously powerful PC but I was never able to, and because there are no good stealth titles coming anytime soon, I decided to sell my rig and take a break from gaming. All because of this garbage modern rehash of a legendary stealth series, just like what happened to Splinter Cell. It should be a crime for these AAA developers to make sh***ty games, put a coat of fancy graphics on, and than slap on the name of a legendary series just to trick people into buying!!!!

WEAK POINTS  -Firstly this game was totally bugged out running 64 bit version, extremely choppy and very slow gameplay, This was solved a few days later buy running the 32 bit version of game.  -The level design is very linear, very simple, (no longer can you roam freely) No more big size levels, with great detail like the old series games. (it's like the Thief version of Call of Duty) -Their are no more hammers, keepers, so much lost.  -Their is no atmosphere.  -The Character can not jump (bizzare!), the AI and enemy are not up to the standard as before.  -The Character sneaks too slow and moves too quickly this destroys the gameplay. You would never want to press the sneak button.  -The Audio gameplay is basically gone ( walking on tiles, carpet, rock isn't as sensestive as before) -The story is just weak.  -This is probably one of the worst game's I've played. nothing memorable about it.    -PROS  -Graphics seems good (but everthing else is a totally failure) Totally regret buying this game, even if it you get it on sale, it will just be a waste of your time.

Edios have turned in snake oil sales men, selling you inferior products, created by bunch of game developers have NO IDEA! how to create a Thief Game. I still can't fadaom how such a studio can can screw up the Thief Series, one best series every released on the PC turned into the worst increment in living history.   I want my money back!

My primary gripe, and one of the things I'm struggling with not boycotting it for, is the lack of Stephen Russell's voice as the excellent Garrett - a choice made for the purposes of full-body motion capture; and a point that is entirely moot since the words spoken are out of sync with the lip movements anyway.

Toward the end I found even the rare few items, always contained in one of the only 4 basic lootable things, dresser, wardrobe, table, floor. Countless pens, ink wells, coins. Loot variety was shocking limited.  The story was poorly connected and even at the end was not wrapped up with any good feelings, I just felt confused and wanted to close the game for the 20th time.  'Horror' segments where you trawl your way through a haunted asylum ques the game to start trying to be anmesia. Monsters that 1 shot you and run around corners only to vanish. Jump scares while looking through key holes made me want to get out as soon as possible. Loot in these levels is again lacking, mabye 5 ink wells and countless again... pens litter the desks that all look the same.   Countless puzzle segments where you endlessly spin your mouse to move a staircase or structure only at the end to have your screen spin rapidly 3 or 4 times becuase there is no clear indication of when to stop spinning.  Segments where you are thrown into areras with countless guards, only to have them pat in terrible, thinkless patterns almost as if they were automations. And even on the hardest default difficunty 'Master' I found myself able to simply shoot countless guards with a smog arrow and run around and take them down, even if more than 1 was on me at once, as the quicktime event of a takedown PAUSES other guards combat.  Overall a very poor game, trying to JAM 'FREE RUNNING', use the term free lightly as there is only 1 path for up to 5 mins + of running at a time, into a stealth game, and does so poorly.  The story did not leave me urning for me, mainly only wanting to stop following it, at the end you are FORCED into a boss fight, and the only way to avoid it is a lengthy and tedious task of repeating the same basic mechanics youve already done 9000 times, and hope the boss with super hearing dosent turn around and use his attack that will ONE SHOT you even behind a pillar.      The city hub is disjointed and annoying, you feel forced to wait over and OVER again for guards to tediously pat, repeat dialoge and move on EVERY TIME you move through it. The city seems lifeless, a couple citizens walking around, saying again... the same things.   So no, I do not recomend this game, dishonored, the game based around killng, had more stealth than this.

Also, this doesn't feel like a Thief game. This feels like the developers may have known that the Thief franchise existed, but spent most of their time playing Dishonoured. All the while giving a crap about optimization and gameplay. One of the great things about the Thief games was your freedom to approach situations. You could move in any direction you wanted, exploit small ledges, anything that's short of a 90 degree wall. Even then you had the climbing gloves in Deadly Shadows. Here everything is contextual. You can only progress in directions the game allows you to. And you can no longer jump. This limitation helps breaking immersion even further. Heck, you can't even drop off ledges if the game thinks you shouldn't go there. Seriously, how can a game developer think 'Man, we have this successful game series where the player decides their approach and has total freedom in moving about. We should definitely remove the ability to jump and design everything linear.'  My guess is, that was done for all the consoles, but who knows for sure...  And what about Pagans and Hammerites? I loved those. They added more dynamic to the game, either being friends or foes, depending on your playstyle. But those were pulled out, to make more room for a dull story that's directly ripped out of Dishonoured's still warm body, instead of coming up with something better and Thief worthy. I'm aware that Thief's storylines wouldn't win a Pulitzer, not by a long shot, but they were much more engaging than this piece of crap.   Graphics are alright, I guess. But in this day and age, what game doesn't have good graphics? So no score for that.

Hammerites, Pagan's and Keepers are all conspicously absent from the story, replacing them with a 'Baron' that we're supposed to be concerned about.  You can see a few places where they swapped out previous factions and story, and replaced them with generic story elements. I can't understand the decision to keep the main character and his associate, yet distance the game from every other part of the established Thief Lore.  One positive I have is that the new voice actor for Garrett (Romano Orzari) is pretty good, and almost allows you to forget that they decided not to bring back Stephen Russell. Almost.  I'm a long time fan of the original series, and I purchased this with an excitment I've not had for any other game announced in the past eight years.

It gets tedious opening every drawer or cabinet in a house and the small rewards are not worth it.  The game has a central city hub you can explore between missions, but there's so many loading screens that you'll give up on that after a couple of hours. Some loading screens are disguised by long animations (opening a window,...), often revealing a small 1 or 2 room apartment behind them.   The graphics are good, but the game is mostly grey and brown wooden buildings. Some more variation and color would have been welcome.  Sound has bigger problems. Voice lines repeat constantly, guards talk over each other and some guards say multiple lines at the same time.  While walking around the city you'll overhear conversations between citizens, but it's always voices coming from a closed window or door. It feels very fake and doesn't make the city feel alive. The few civilians you do see just stand around doing nothing.  The game isn't awful (and the story missions don't have most of these problems), but it wasn't interesting enough to make me put up with the constant loading screens and repetitive thieving.",

            "review_text": "Pathetic attempt at modernizing a classic series. These younger developers haven't learned from the past, believing that QTE's and nice animations make for some fun gameplay. While the world in Thief is quite pretty, Dishonored seems to have really taken the mantle as what constitutes as the new stealth king. Thief lacks a jump button, the designers seem to think that being a master thief AND a free runner, the jump button isn't nessary. The entire world is contextural, you can only do what the small minded designers want you to do. Forget about using the rope arrow to explore the different options of getting into a building, there's only ONE place to use that. While the textures and lighting is nice, the world is too small and cramped, it seems that the City has shrunk.  Why is it that the modern designers think that every game has to be like Assassin's Creed? or Call of Duty. If I wanted to play an Assassin's Creed game, I would, but these days publishers seem to think that everything should be like that. Lack of real good gameplay makes this seem like a glorified tech demo. Stay away from this unless you like dumbed down games and watching cutscenes which is basically every younger gamer out there and that makes me sad for the future of games. This reboot should have never happened and I want my money back on this turd.  Ok, three hours into this and yes it's still quite simple and no real challenge. Remember that the designers couldn't make a GOOD game due to the console limitations. I still think that this game is not very good.  Now I am 5 hours in, and while the only thing that I really like about this game is the movement, but the lack of a jump button, dedicated lean keys and just bad level design really make this game more suitable to the console player with its simplistic control scheme and general hand-holding, the game will play itself, and solve all the puzzles for you if the designers were allowed to. Hence, this game really lacks any imagination and freedom of movement that the previous games had, including a JUMP button. Thanks, Edios for ♥♥♥♥ing up another franchise.  6 Hours in and while I like the way you move, it has a nice weight and smooth movement the lack of freedom in the levels make this a neutered piece of crap. Why am I still playing? i paid 10 bucks for this turd and I plan on finishing it. The level design so far is quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Small areas and lack of choice are what drags this down. I miss being able to stack and move crates, getting stuck on a box, unable to jump OR climb on shows that the designers don't know how to make good gameplay. Console players will feel right at home with this, the game will actually play it self. One long cutscene, this is what 'modern' gameplay is, makes me sad :(  12 hours in, and it's not getting any better. The lack of options in the levels make for some very restrictive gameplay. A level under a brothel was uneventful, the brothel itself didn't need the nudity and sex scenes. The amount of cutscenes are two much, obviously the designers don't know how to convey story info through a invisible cutscene. It's very jarring to have control yanked out from under you as a cutscene takes over, making you totally lose the inmersive world that the creators so painstakinly create, bad design choices reek throughout this POS of a game. The contextual gameplay makes for lots of mistakenly closed doors, or dousing of lights when all you really want to do is pick up a stupid piece of gold. The amount of animations for every little thing that Garret does is just to much after awhile, once again the control is yanked away and you lose the inmersivness again.  While the visuals in the Brothel and underneath are quite pretty, the size of these levels are too small to really take advantage of Garret and his 'swoop' ability, which has no reason to exsist other than to compete with Dishonored, same with the Focus ability. These make a simple game  too  simple. AI is nothing to get worked up about, it's dead brained and make the stealth kinda useless.  17 hours in, I've been taking my time. What is it with the lack of a persistant world where you leave a side mission and come back and have to do the entire waste of time again? With the limitations of the PC, the first two games had thier issues but they made up for it in large levels and engrossing gameplay. Those games where qutie clever in level design, you really had to think about where you were and where were the guards where in relation to your goal. Their AI routines where persistant and they would hunt you down, in this game all you need to do is lose LOS and your clear. No real challenge or any sense of danger from being caught. I don't think any kid today could ever play the originals and complete them. How could they? with no sense of the past consoler's lose a vital part of what makes simple gameplay so compelling, this goes for the game's designers too. Thief lacks the respect to the originals, throwing on a shiny sheen and gimmicks that have no place in the world.  Having played alot of PC games since 1995, I found that the further you get away from the triple A titles, the better in terms of originality, fun, and art and design the better. Once in awhile you get a good title, Dishonored, Wolfenstein, Deus Ex, (not HR, lousy boss battles) but these are far and few between. Its innovation that stems from the limitation of the tech that inspires different types of gameplay and level design, Thiefs designers are limited by their lack of being able to see the limits of the consoles and using that as an advantage. Instead adding gimmicks and cheap story telling rather than engaging the player to really take their time and just soak up the world. Focus, and swoop (such a stupid, uninspired name) make Thief qutie boring, they also force the player to rush forward instead of just stopping and take a look. I know a lot of players like this game, but the reasons they like it have no merit. A shiny coat and some flashy effects can't hide the designers lack of imagination. I actually hope that they all get ♥♥♥ cancer. I don't know if I'll be able to bring myself to finish this as I don't know what the story is about.... unrest? plague? characters that are too lazy to fetch their own ♥♥♥♥? I don't know. I really really really want to like this game, I am huge Thief player but I can't get past these crates cause I can't climb on them or jump on them or even pick them up and move them.......  Ok, 23 hours in, have I really been playing this for that long? I've been doing the Basso missions, and started on the so-called haunted insane asylum mission and really hate jump scares, their not scary and this level is boring. I thought that there would be a huge asylum to explore, secrets and other goodies to find but no. After the last level with the 'giant' safe, I found that the inconsistant art, and almost useless arrow selection really don't make a difference. What can one arrow do that the others can't? nothing except cost more. The impossible architecture don't scale well, what's with the outside being huge and the inside being so small and cramped? Nothing makes sense. When I am in this game, I take my time to remove the guards to make exploring easier. After I leave an area I find that the guards are all now awake and I have to do it all over again, talk about padding up the gameplay. And the amount of loading screens it torture, why oh why can't consoles at least hold the entire level? I mean this ain't 2003 dark shadows era. Triple A gaming, in terms of tech haven't evolved much, You would think that with the power of the machines that this would not be a problem but covering it up with a fancy animation doesn't make it any better.",

EDIT: After a month of playing this horrible game I finally finished it, so I can finish my review too.  I can personally tell, that only good thing in this game is that it has no sequel and it's creators won't make another Thief game for a long time. As other good side of this worse reboot of game franchise, it had these pros:  + Chapter 5 - Moira Asylum. It's wasn't like the game other chapters and had really decent horror game athmosphere. Decent but not good enaugh; + Sound and music during chase scenes, also when guards are looking for you; + Chase scenes altogether were good, nice music and visual effects, really good but it's not Tomb Rider good, because at some point you are thief, not a Indiana Jones; + Main story line is very bad, but gives you good twists some times. + AI is somewhat better than I expected, especially on Master Difficulty.  Cons, where to begin:  - It's not a Thief; - It's not an Assassins Creed; - It's not a Hitman; - It is a mutant son of past memories about this game series style and new generation stealth games style, more of their b**tard son.  I'm sure this game had a lot of negative reviews and I don't want to add even more.  My final score of this game is:  4/10  P.S. Side missions sucked, dogs and parrots p*ssed me off. Peace",

That is what makes this game so hard to play. Once you've played Dishonored (where both games stemmed from the original Thief series), you can't say Thief is good. I has all the elements there, but not that engaging gameplay. It has the right tools, the right missions, but it is lacking. I don't have that drive to keep going with the game, it's directionless.  Things I love? I love the stealth element, it's well done, I like a game that doesn't force you to go and engage in battle with enemies if you don't want to - but the stealth element is... I'm just going to overuse the word; lacking. You would expect a Thief to run along the rooftops, to make some simple 'video-game' jumps, even some routes you feel would be accessible in real life, are missing. It's very 'dash from shadow to shadow' type gameplay. Sure, there are lots of different paths through the shadows, but ultimately, you're just doing the same thing over and over again.  From the beginning, I expected to be launched straight into a complex and rich storyline, but I was disappointed. One might argue that Thief avoids a cliche-style storyline, but for me, it just wasn't engaging enough to keep playing. Perhaps I will come back to this game and jump that hurdle, but right now? It just isn't doing it for me.  If you read any of the professional reviews, I agree completely with them, that's really all you need to know.",

Some sounds you'd think guards would hear such as footsteps aren't heard, but things you think they wouldn't hear like messing up a lock pick they do hear, and apperently this is even loud enough to wake sleeping guards. Not only this, but occasionly it's impossible to hear people six feet away from you; you can hear the guy who is five feet away clearly, but can't hear a single thing the guy six feet away is. The game is also fairly easy even on the highest difficulty and with all of the help things off. The Parkour also really sucks, each time you go to do a manuver you snap to the object and lose all momentum..It's also rather contextual, and limiting.",

There's a single conversation between two guards about the word 'taffer', and Chapter 7 has you exploring the ruins of an old cathedral where the symbols bears striking similarity to the Hammerite and Mechanist symbols. That's it.  - Rope arrows are more like puzzle mechanics than actual rope arrows from the original series. They cost 600 gold apiece (at Master difficulty), can only be fired at specific hanging posts, and cannot be collected again once fired.  - There's no dedicated jump button. The spacebar will allow you to swoop (think: stealth roll in Skyrim), mantle up ledges, and climb ladders and ropes, but there is no jump button. Case in point: One of the final Basso side jobs has you breaking into an aparment. Said apartment has a window out on a ledge that is two feet away from the ledge you are currently on, and would be an easy task to get to IF THE GAME HAD A JUMP BUTTON. Instead, the mission forces you to go around to the side and waste 600 gold on a rope arrow to get in.  - Boss battles.  - BLOODY SCREEN SO REAL when your health is low.  - The windows. There are a few windows that you can open, and when you start the opening animation you are either A) given a quicktime event where you mash E for no apparent reason, or B) don't have to do a quicktime event since it's a level transition. The problem is, the game never tells you which one is which until it's too late, the minimap and map have no level transition markers. And you cant just exit out of the quicktime event, you need to go through the entire motion of the animation.  - Placement of the guards means that you are going to have to exploit dumb AI and game mechanics if you want to get a Ghost rating. Similarly, it is virtually impossible to play it Lytha style (no detections, no evidence, no knockouts, you were never there).   In short, save your money and just buy Dishonored. It's a much better Thief game than Thief. Alternatively, go buy the original Thief trilogy from GOG.",

            "review_text": "  Thief: Deadly Shadows   was so good for its time that everyone understood - no matter what next  Thief  would be, it will be constantly compared with predecessor. To be successful, it is vital for it not to look bad in comparison. Designers bore that in mind. Almost every aspect of game has evolved.  Gameplay  has been balanced, and now you cannot grab things instantly and without moving. Light gem mechanic was simplified, now containing only three distinct states (at first I was quite dissatisfied with this, though, as I saw later, it did not harm gameplay complexity). Imbalanced wall-flattening was removed, replaced by fixed location hiding places - empty closets. Focus feature introduction made gameplay more smooth, it is almost impossible to get stuck now (and, because Focus resource is quite limited, it was achieved without significant complexity loss). Ghost-Opportunist-Predator rankings is great and encourages rich non-linear gameplay. Combat is more dynamic and now, with proper player skill, Garrett poses real threat in one-on-one combat.  Art  is just great. Models, textures, sounds - everything is beyond expectations. I do not value these things much, so cannot tell deep detail, but even I can see work well done.  Still, as you can see, I do not recommend this game. In evaluating  Thief  I, like many others, compare it to  Deadly Shadows . But from my point of view,  Thief  loses the match with a huge score gap. This is because the things I liked in  Deadly Shadows  the most were the  atmosphere , the  story  and  characters  who acted in it. In  Thief , there is only one lively character for the whole game. It could be fine with a thieving game if it was protagonist. But no, it is a fence, Basso. To add insult to injury, Basso does practically nothing in whole storyline. Beside some quest-giving in beginning of game, his only appearance is in chapter four, where Garret has to rescue him from prison (a princess in tower could be there instead of Basso with no impact on the narrative). With no bright characters there is no bright story. Atmosphere is ruined. Introducing collectible sets is the most dubious thing, it turns Garret from cold-blooded and cold-minded thief into some short-sighted kleptomaniac, who stashes valuables worth thousands of coins in dirty destroyed clock tower for some unknown reasons. Remember brilliant mission in Shalebridge Cradle? Compare atmosphere in Cradle and in Moira Asylum. Compare mission narratives. Double facepalm is not enough to describe a feeling when you see a crude fake copied from masterpiece. This mission just should not have been added to the story. It looks worthless for those who played  Deadly Shadows  and loved it. All strong ideologies in the City are dead and this is explicitly shown to us: Keeper Library and Hammer Cathedral are abandoned and there is no trace of their inhabitants. Designers burned with desire to destroy the City as player remembers it, and this desire provoked blunders. Abandoned buildings look like they were abandoned for centuries, not for decades, with no rational explanation for that scope of destruction. The City is dead and agonizing, with no purpose to exist, which impacts on playing experience in form of question 'Why should I care and try to save it?' In urge to destroy, nothing was proposed in return. Designers performed just like Orion's revolutionaries - they kill all guards, set city on fire and then... nothing. It just stays burning forever, until you finally close  Thief  to never run it again. Greatest forces you encounter are just some power-hungry feudal lords. Remember how exciting was first mission in  Deadly Shadows , in Rutherford Castle, reading about all of those intrigues they were plotting against each other? And how worthless they all started to look when Keepers, Hammers and Pagans stepped on the stage? On day four or five you would not even remember that there are some 'Great Families' and that they mean anything in the City. Nothing like that anymore. You just stick to all those nobles' dirty underwear. No big ideas. Only realpolitik, only hardcore. Having read all above, you should understand why the story is primitive and predictable (and quite secondary too - revolution line looks like another crude fake copied from masterpiece - this time   Dishonored  ).  Thief  is another unfortunate example of a game that was created with huge budget and effort of specialists, but without aim to be a piece of art. It is good for killing time, but there is nothing truly beautiful in it. Just business. Do not have any illusions - it will not 'unfold in the end' like   Bioshock Infinite  . It will just fade away, leaving only one word afterwards. Disappointment.",

            "review_text": "I recently finished this game on the hardest difficulty with all side content complete. Here are my thoughts:   What I Liked:  -The customizeable difficulty was a really cool idea and I enjoyed shooting for the 700 point challenge. Basically the game lets you pick a base difficulty and then set a ton of modifiers worth varying levels of points. My settings forced a game over if I was seen or touched anyone and I enjoyed having the option to do that. -The game is completely ghostable and it doesn't rely on abusing AI patterns or using glitches. Careful observation and exploration allow for some really useful alternate approaches similar to Dishonored. I was able to able to ghost (despite what the broken post-mission rating said) every single main mission and every single sidequest in the game on the hardest difficulty so props to the devs for allowing for that. -The swoop mechanic is a joy to use. It is incredibly handy for crossing those small gaps between the darkness when you can't take out the light or ducking back into a corner after swiping some loot while a guard's back was turned. The animation and sound effect give it this nice agile feel and it's hard not to feel like a pro thief every time you use it. -I really liked that the best loot was tied to exploration-based puzzles. It was fun picking through documents to find clues for vault codes or searching for ways to disable traps. The sidequests really take advantage of this and some of the later ones feel quite clever. -Thiefing in general was fun. Pickpocketing has a nice feel to it. It's risky, but not overly hard. Picking locks is simple, but trying to do it before a patrol returns can be quite tense. The animation for cutting paintings out of their frames is superb. -The full body-awareness is nice. I love all the intricate first-person animation (though a couple get old fast) and seeing your legs is always a plus. -The devs didn't skimp on content either. The game took me roughly 20 hours to see all the content. The Client side missions are definitely worth checking out as they take place in areas separate from the hub and are pretty involved, taking anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour.   What I Accepted:  -The AI is consistent and reads pretty well from the player standpoint which I think is the most important aspect of designing AI for stealth games. They aren't terribly clever, but they do feel like a threat. -The art is solid. The visual variety is a bit lacking, but the style they went for works well with the theme and the character design is pleasant. Dishonored definitely takes the cake here, but Thief isn't without it's merits. -The non-stealth segments are a bit goofy, but they make up a miniscule percentage of the game. The bridge sequence was actually pretty cool as a visual setpiece and it wasn't as jarring as the previous one had been. -The third-person platforming stuff could have been used a lot more than it was. There were only 3-4 actual implementations of it and most of them were just there as the only way to reach a new area. I wish they had used this system to add more verticality to levels.   What I Disliked:  -The blatant streaming-in-the-new-area animations were really annoying. There are 2-3 of them that get used for the whole game and I would honestly have preferred a loadscreen if we have to compensate for ♥♥♥♥♥ier platforms. By the end of the game you never want to pry open another window for the rest of your life. -The story execution is pretty terrible. The plot is poorly explained and important characters will show up like twice over the course of the 15-20 hour game. When I reached the end I was completely lost on why they even bothered. It's ridiculous and nonsensical. -The sidequest organization in the city gets really old by the end due to the lack of fast travel. I would probably recommend just letting everything sit till the point of no return and then do it all then because if you do them as they become available you will be crossing the city back and forth twenty or so times. It gets really ♥♥♥♥ing old when you are ghosting the game and are creeping past the same guards for the tenth time. -The game has a very stitched-together feel and the troubled development is obvious when playing. There are a couple segments that you can tell the guys who were trying to save the game couldn't do anything about short of completely redoing them, which wasn't an option after 5+ years of pre-existing dev time. It's a bummer. -The pre-order bonus is one of the best missions in the game. It's a really well-fleshed out side mission where you rob a bank that has multiple levels of security. It was really fun and it bothered me that most of the people playing the game down the road probably won't be playing it.   Conclusion:  If you hold the first two games sacred, don't bother with this entry. This game is not for you and you will be wasting your time and money. No one is asking for you to do community service and torture yourself with it. If you liked Dishonored a lot though, Thief 2014 might be worth checking out at the 15$ or less price range and you can pretend it's a spin-off from that series, because let's be honest, that is what the game feels like.",

            "review_text": "Thief's reboot came as a huge disappointment to me. Though the basic core mechanics are somehow functional, everything feels extremely artificial, constricted and predictable. The level design is both linear and uninspired, with obvious solutions to every single problem that's encountered. In addition to this, it is also highly inconsistent, and simple patterns are repeated way too often.  The game isn't so much about observation and decision making anymore, it's more about dexterity and following the path that was carefully crafted for the player. Which is a real shame, considering that player movement is again very clumsy and restricted. I ended up getting spotted or falling to my death a few times only because Garett didn't perform the contextual action one would expect.  Note that the linear structure is not necessarly a deal breaker for stealth games. Dishonored and Splinter Cell: Blacklist have the same level structure at their core, but individual action bubbles offer much more interesting challenges. Their AI is much more agressive, but the player is also granted additional options, meaning that playing as a ghost in those games require a fair amount of planning before jumping in the action. Thief doesn't have this anymore.  Secondary game mechanics also feel very tedious. Lockpicking really only is a chore, and one you'll have to do pretty often moreover. Even stealing loot is painful because of the stupidly long animations which get triggered for every single action you perform. They're nice to watch the firt couple of times, but it just feels completely silly and boring when you pick up a bunch coins literally one at a time. Finally, the main city hub is also completely uninteresting. There's absolutely no challenge in exploring it, and I very quickly got bored of breaking into completely random windows (with once again a ridiculously long animation) only to slavage a couple of pointless items.  After only 4 hours of gameplay, I'm already at the stage where I have absolutely no desire to get back to Thief, and think I will just stop there. I've only played the first 4 chapters (master difficulty), and so far there hasn't been one single moment where I felt that the game rewarded careful observation, planning or creative problem solving. It's only been about mindlessly crawling in the shadows, which should be one element of steal gameplay, but definitely not the whole thing. If you haven't played them yet, I would much rather recomment trying Dishonored, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, or the older Thief and Project: IGI games.",

I am a new thief player and have always enjoyed stealth games and was looking forward to see this reboot of the franchise that started it all. And all this game had me saying was I should really be playing dishonored instead. It felt almost exactly the same in every aspect. This would be fine by me if it they had been released close to each other but dishonored came out over 2 years prior which is a standard development cycle.  The main story can get schizophrenic at times and several times I was lost having to look at recaps online of what was actually going on. The game liked to switch between 3 main storylines and not really explain when or why they were doing this. I think this was to make the game seem more mysterious and edgy, which I just found to be irritating. It seemed like the story was mashed together when square needed to stretch out this 7 hour main story.  Now there are some points that I fail to grasp between game play mechanics and the story. The main one being that there is a huge point in this game to say that he doesn't kill people, only the ones who need it. This is brought up at least 4 times in the first 5 minutes of gameplay. Even saying that it was wrong of Erin to kill a guard Yet one of the first things you get is broadhead arrows allowing you to just headshot your way through the game if you wanted. It even gives you slow-motion kill cams, Garrett you hate killing as much as I hate Lord Gaben. I assume this was implemented to help out newer players but it just kind of makes his moral high ground that is referred to countless times fall flat.  This games stealth feels fantastic 95% of the time. Getting to hide in the shadows and climb your way across the rooftops and hiding in the alleys to make it through complex puzzles of guards. In almost ever encounter in this game I found a way to get through it without having to knockout or kill guards.   Another thing that I really enjoyed were the weapon upgrades and trinkets. It seemed like a fair amount of thought went into creating the names for them and what they do each of them made sense and were well thought out that level of immersion added a nice touch when upgrading my health of focus.   I would say that my main gripes from this game didn't come from anything related to the game play but rather that the story was cliche and bland. I feel like if that I had put more time creating a fleshed out story that didn't quite feel so linear and run of the mill I would have enjoyed this game much more. But with nice stealth mechanics and thought put into gameplay I have to say this game works for someone who wants to take their time and not marathon through it and for someone playing on a console.

Prepare to fall to your death half the time you want to make a jump because the game would suddenly decide that Space means 'jump 20 meters down off the roof' rather than 'hop to the next roof one meter in front of you'. Slip off the roofs, railings and other ledges randomly. Enjoy solving 'puzzles' involving finding your way around half-a-meter wide pressure plates - you know, the kind you could just STEP over in real life, easily - because Garret the Master Thief can not.  Also, for some reason you can't knock out civilians - the mission just fails instantly if you throw a bottle at them or do a takedown (which is non-lethal), and they just cough a bit and go about their business if you try using a choke arrow on them.  The story is uninspired and trite; characters don't make you feel a thing for them. Guards' lines are repetitive and get on your nerves. I swear I'm gonna kill next person who says they want a cup of coffee or their back hurts.  Save your money and play old Thiefs or Dishonored instead.",

The level design is linear, your tools of the trade only work on designated spots (jump included!), the writing is bad, the sound design very flawed (the volume is all over the place). Moreover this screams 'consolitis' unashamedly: For example if you play with keyboard and mouse, you must not turn off the frame-search helper, otherwise you won't know where a hidden button behind a picture frame is. Players with a gamepad get a vibration, for kb+m there is no alternative apart from a UI signal.  Everyone forgot about this game, its price fell and there were no cry for more.  Do yourself a favor and buy the first three Thieves. Or play them again. Or play the Dark Mod. Nothing to see here, just a butchered series.",

The first six or so hours of this game are actually quite enjoyable. You really feel like a sneaky pickpocket while slinking your way through the city and progressing the story. Then some elements of the game become evident which really take away from the fun. For instance, navigating through the city every time you embark on a mission becomes absurdly tiresome. Getting from point A to point B is much more of a chore than it should be.  Then there's the stealing. Remember how in Skyrim when you killed your first dragon, it was a really epic experience but then later in the game you'd see a dragon and you'd just sigh in annoyance? Same thing here but with stealing. So much fun searching through 5 drawers for one letter opener worth 3 gold. The name of the game is Thief and stealing crap is just boring and tedius and doesn't really serve much of a purpose anyway (at least once you buy the few skills needed to play the game).

Everywhere you go feels like a trashed back alley and it looks like buildings are stacked on each other. -You may rob buildings in the city only ONCE PER GAME. -The guards in the city have the exact same conversations over and over again, starting them over only about five seconds after they finished. -The Game crashes randomly. -Key elements of the plot are left unexplained or only barely explained. -The whole game looks grey and dreary.  To summarize, imagine if Thief 3's story revolved around the time travel elements from the Shalebridge Cradle, and that is pretty much what this game's story is like almost from start to finish.",

The graphics further made me want to play this game so I bought it on a sale and started playing.  The gameplay mechanics, in my opinion, were executed well, but I actually had more fun slaughtering guards and shooting them from afar than sneaking behind them and stealing their goods. I don't have a single chapter completed with 'Ghost', in the end everyone got an arrow in their knee. One of the things I liked more was the variety of arrows the sellers provided, ranging from Water Arrows used to put out torches so you can hide easier in the shadows, to the Fire and Explosive Arrows that can light up a guard's body. The focus ability I found very useful in my playthrough, and I always had at least 1 of these flowers that replenished it when you use it all.  The story was actually nothing special, and I didn't actually play because of it. In a point of the game, it actually became rather boring.  All good, but the game is terribly optimized, since the 1st chapter I constantly had bugs, glitches and all kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the worst part is that many people have experienced the same bugs. I haven't even finished the game and I don't even want to play ever again, the most devastating thing being that my saves got all corrupted and deleted right in the final event of the final chapter. This, and much more had led me to not recommend this game, because if I wanted only the gameplay of Thief, I could have played the older, superior games.  4.5/10",

An endless amount of repeated dialogue, not a single deviation in guard patrol areas. It doesn't help much that half of the guards are screaming though empty streets. You don't have much liberty either, as many of objects simply don't interact. The controls are a mess and confusing, and when you do get used to them they still feel sloppy.  Even though their are 3 paths to follow: Ghost, oppurtunist and predator. Even if you like stealth and want to avoid deaths, It's most likely you'll end up with the oppurtunist path. A single flaw in your ghost playthrough and you'll end up with oppurtunist. When you do get into combat you simply are a goner. I feel that's more of a good thing, as it rewards stealth.   Sadly, this isn't as good a stealth title that it could have been. If you are a fan of stealth, have a lot of patience and don't get easily frustrated, this can be a game for you.

Wait and buy it at $29.99 and under I'd say would be a fair price. Gameplay is really sluggish and sometimes glitchy often times I have to back up and reaproach ledges to get him to climb up. On one re-load to a save point, I spawned in a vent and I didn't make it to a guard that was beneath me that the game practically begged me to drop onto, I didn't, since I was trying to be stealthy and then the game wouldn't let me jump down out of the vent. I had to load my save and jump down on him.  If you find yourself in combat it is very frustrating, the default key binds are very annoying if you want to do anything but shoot your arrows at the guards. It really makes you want to ghost through the levels because anything else is just more annoying.  The game sounds just aren't quite right, music blasts up to high levels what seems like random, often times drowning out dialogue. In a few cut scenes the sounds didn't match up with the action or mouth movement. And the voice actors are very annoying. I often found when I could somewhat get immersed in the gameplay it would be ruined by dialogue.  Graphics are beautiful I'll give it that. But I have to question who designed Garrett, the guy looks like a goth teen who threw on a corset and a hood.   Overall it's basically a more sluggish Dishonored, with the goal of looting trinkets from every nook and cranny in the map. The thieving aspect of the game is very clever in their implimentations but loose their appeal to me after the fifth time you do it and you're only 30 min into the game. With the exception of the graphics the game feels like an indie developed game, great concepts just not quite executed properly.  For me to reverse my opinion of the game, they'd have to overhaul the game movement so you could flow better from ledges to cover, combat system would have to improve to have actual fighting ability. Finally, Garrett would need to never talk and keep his mask up haha.",

Don't get me wrong... there are moments of brilliance here as well but they are so few and far between that the experience becomes a hard slog trying to find those rare gems.   Towards the end of the game (including completing all side quests), I just wanted the game to be over with to get some closure on the whole experience. After the disappointing ending (I won't throw out any spoilers but trust me... it's bad) I couldn't get this game off of my harddrive fast enough.

If you are a huge fan of the series, you may want to give this a try but understand you are going to have to wade through a lot of garbage to find those elements you love. 5/10    Pros: - Atmosphere - they really do get the old city feel right - Garret Animation - the 1st person perspective uses a lot of hand animations which are very convincing - Game Mechanics/Motor Skills - Garret's acrobatics feels right and offer some additional tricks to the older 'one arrow to rule them all' theme - Guard Suspicion Meter - The system used to show guards suspicion meter was well implemented - Lockpicking - I found the lockpicking to be a fun mini-game. Eventually it does get old but some of my favorite moments of the game was trying to pick a lock quickly before a gaurd came back in the room. - Mansion/Brothel - The Baron's Mansion and the Brothel are fun levels and feel the closest to the original Thief levels - Asylum - This level is a little cliche but is creepy (if you are into that sort of thing) - Side Quests - These came pretty late in the game but served to break up the monotony of the main quest  Cons: - Controls - Saved on the learning curve but having one button do everything (jump, swoop, climb, open) made the game feel console based - Load Screens - The city and each level are divided by big loading screens which breaks the immersion significantly. Note that these are in-game and not between missions like in the original Thief series. - Travel Animations - Opening windows and traveling between city sections contain neat animations that lose their luster after you have seen them 200+ times.  - Level Design - This is a Linear game through and through... The level will have one path you need to go through but disguise giving you options by presenting two obvious ways (always high and low) to access that one path. This is true even for the city-scape which was a huge missed opportunity. - Gameplay mechanics - Ultimately the gameplay mechanics are too light for a game of this size. The puzzles presented are interesting for the first few levels but it feels like the devs ran out of ideas some way through the game and began using the same 4 or 5 obstacles repeatedly without mixing it up.  - Audio/Pathing Bugs - The audio for this game is ridiculously buggy.. I lost count of the errors I encountered but often had to reload so I could here some important feature. Likewise there is a pathing bug that I witnessed probably 10 times where an NPC sprite will begin swirling in place.  - Stats Tracking Bugs - By far the most frustrating, some of the levels don't track your in-game stats correctly (Ch3 and 4 are big offenders) so at the end of the level it will tell you that you played the level differently than you actually did.  - Dogs - Dogs are static NPCs (being stuck in cages). I imagine this was decided due to budget but it feels like a missed opportunity - Noise floor panels - The old thief noise meter and moss arrows are replaced with broken glass and puddles which are a poor replacement and at times doesn't fit with the level look and feel - Story/Plotline - This is probably one of the worse in-game stories I've encountered. Not sure who wrote this but they should look for a new craft... the story is full of plot-holes, poorly thought out characters and questionable storytelling. - Cutscenes - The cutscenes are beautiful but are largely unnecessary (especially considering the lousy plot) and serve to break the immersion  - Side Quests - These were two few and far between and felt like an afterthought. These had an opportunity to turn the game into a completely different experience but ultimately the dev team dropped the ball.  - Late-Game Salesmen - In the later levels, in order to give you an opportunity to purchase more supplies while you are in the level, they actually hide equipment salesmen in sewers and in closets in the same houses you are breaking into... it's just weird and immersion breaking - Bosses - I hate bosses in most games but in this game they were just awful. It's supposed to be a sneaking game for @&amp;$&amp;!-sake why are you forcing us through an action scene?",

What i dont like about the game play. there are no 100% stealthy ways to take some one out from a distance. I tryed every thing for this head shot where not killing any one or would alert all the guards. climbing feels like crap there are SOO many dead ends in climbing like oh i am walking on the roof and now i am forced to go through guards. i thought climbing in this game would be more like assasins creed or dishonered IT IS NOT Patchworky map design i feel like i am loading every 5-10 min like they would have a room with no exit you go in through the window and load to get in then you load again to get out because all thats in most of the rooms is a little gold  this game did have some cool things though like i like how you look for switches and turn weels. however i feel like this game is missing some thing big i would not recomend this to any one. when i got it i was hoping it would be like dishonered but its not at all at least dishonered had a solid story line and interesting mechanics to keep you interested but this is honestly one of the most un-interesting games i have ever played. i will stumble though it some day and may be i will change my reveiw but i doubt it ",

But the world is a maze at the moments where you just want to get from A to B but a linear corridor when you want to explore. The map is next to useless in the big city because there are no icons whatsoever on it. The AI too, is pretty awful, seriously when you are in the 'dark' (i.e. not in direct light) you can stand as close as you want to the guards and they will be none the wiser. They are quick to give up a chase when you are spotted but are also blissfully easy to knock out. I never realised how important audio is in a game until I played this. The audio can cut out, get caught in loops, or the range can screw up. I really shouldnt be able to hear a conversation happening 3 houses away. The few redeeming features lie in the slick animations of the main character but that being said, this is a first person game. Its' so well polished in some areas and not at all in others. I found myself getting fully immersed and then I would get pitifully lost or the sound of rain would randomly appear and I would be jarred back out. Don't be a mug like me and buy this game at full price, or even at all. If you are feeling the stealth bug give Mark of the Ninja, Splinter Cell Blacklist or Dishonored (The DLC for that is pretty good too) a shot. Each of those are cruel but fair in their own right, but thats what stealth is all about.  ",

On the negative side in addition to the difficulty problem, it could learn a lot from Dishonoured in terms of story development, much better learning curve and progression and wouldn't hurt to borrow dynamics from the splinter cell series - in fact its literally begging for a 3rd person option.  In all I was disappointed, as it try's really hard to immerse you in an atmospheric setting where you are a master thief but fails to deliver the mechanics to quite pull it off or entice you to play on past the first hour.",

I played Thief back in the day and I still recall trembling with glee as I saw its cover and realized that someone had really made the game I always dreamed they would. And it was everything I hoped for and then some. I've played them all since then and even though Thief III started to lean towards the dull precipice of console gaming, I still enjoyed a lot of it and preordered this reboot. I shouldn't have and I'm never paying for something they haven't made yet again. Ok so:   Good things:  The graphics capture the atmosphere really well. Certain parts of the city feel exactly like I imagine old London or something felt and that' very cool.   Bad things:  And that's why this is so bloody frustrating. They had the tools, they'd made the setup for this game and then they dropped it on the floor. The story is weak and not particularly engaging. Garret isn't his old self and a bit too emo. The level design is far from inspiring and you're mostly dragged along a linear course with no planning and few options. Moving the character around feels a bit clumsy and ancient which was fine in 99 but not so much now. Worst of all though: the sound is utterly messed up. You can't tell where voices come from and that's just not ok in a stealth game. It breaks immersion and makes it really hard to navigate the darkness in a stealthy way.   In the end we needed more missions, more planning, less moving back and forth over the same (admittedly fairly gorgeous) cityscape. We needed a protagonist with a cynical story and his good old sarcastic approach to everything and one that felt like you were moving around a master thief and not a clunky dude from 99.   This game was a big let-down. It wasn't all bad, it's playable, but it had SO much potential and could so easily have been a lot more. Frustrating.",

The environments are very detailed, there is enough of loot to steal, the sound and music are pretty good, and most of the NPC voice work is great. However, I really miss the voice of Stephen Russell, who really put the 'character' into Garrett - the new Thief has so little character he's practically boring (any one of the cut scenes from Thief 2 had more character than this entire game does).  Getting used to the new control scheme is challenging, to say the least. I found the movement to be very stiff and it seems like you really have to hold the action key for a while before you physically do something. The swoop movement never seems to work when I need it to, and the grappling hook is meh because you really don't actually 'use' it (like a rope arrow) - it's just a animated sequence mechanic that allows Garrett to climb something.  In terms of graphics, they are nice but the city is also very dark and hard to navigate, and all the colors are all so similar that it's sometimes hard to make out where you are or what you are looking at. I first played this on a GTX 660Ti and moving up to a GTX 980 seems to have made little difference other than some particle effects, which just make it even more difficult to visually understand what you are looking at.  I also was not really fond of all the backtracking and excessive revisits to the city when you go from point A to B. There really should have been some kind of fast travel option that eliminates all of this. Having a map in the upper right corner was not all that much help either. I remember people complaining about a lack of openness to the City in Thief 3 back in the day, but this is no real improvement either - you will see the same few people, guards, etc in all the same places.  But what I miss the most was the humor from the old games. They were hilarious without overdoing it (drunk Barney, everyone being a 'taffer', etc), had many hidden funny moments in the scrolls and notes left behind, and were charming in their own ways.This iteration has more modern language and concepts that don't always feel at home, and it's obvious that modern movies have been a big influence on the game.  is it worthy of being in the franchise? I wish I could give the game a mediocre rating, but Steam forces a yes or no recommendation. I used to recommend this game, but I am changing my opinion to No since it sucks just enough to make me not want to go back and replay it.   Thief veterans will probably not enjoy it as much, but younger newcomers will probably be all over it.",
