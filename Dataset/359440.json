            "review_text": "In a sentence this game is about old-school RPG gameplay. There's power gaming, story, and lots of replayability. You control 4 schmucks  or just 1 and a wad of dirty slaver cash  on a quest to slay the Swamp King and halt the creeping poison from consuming the world. There are many quests and moral dilemmas you will face as you rise to be the heros the world deserves, but history is never silent; are your swords, fists, and guns good enough to remain pure?  I highly recommend this game if you like J/RPGS. That being said, here's some more details and greivances:    There's 3 primary paths that will give power gamers a lot of variation in playstyle: Airship, Key of Light, and 4 artifacts that each have an associated skill &amp; stat boost. In all honesty the stat boost path is boring, the only nice thing about it is the literature spell which can be very satisfying way of wiping out an encounter or boss. The Key of Time opens paths otherwise unavailable to the player and follows along with a more linear path than the airship.    Holy jar goblins Batman!  Let me tell you about the beauty that is the airship   The airship can be acquired within 3 minutes of starting a new game with no difficulty whatsoever and it appeals to the power gamer more than every other option. It stops encounters, takes you all over the world (outside of a few areas that are related to a quest that you can't land on sort of deal), and gives you access to far more power far more quickly than the other options. With clever planning you can even weasel your way to level 10-13 and over 200,000 gold, soaring all around the world completing quests at the  heavy  expense of the NPCs in a little under 30 minutes. Every quest is open to you (outside of tiered quests with 1-2 prerequisite quests) as soon as you start the game. It is without a doubt what every power gamer would be questing for hours on end for and the King is ready for you to take it without even slaying a  slime  Mite. I love the airship.    The game has a couple of classes, but a Warrior and  Mage  Shaman form the core of every easier to play party. The warrior is the most expensive, requiring gold to get the most out of his tankiness. I believe that the enemies target the party members towards the front more often, which is why you want him looking shiny. The  Wizard  Shaman goes in the back as he is the best healer and spell caster. No spells are learned by leveling up, only stats are gained, and you have to get artifacts which are only teachable to one character and then they're gone. So make sure you don't accidentally teach your Warrior that super powerful spell that you really need to beat a boss or you'll have wasted that resource forever unless you saved recently. The other classes include Explorer who's special ability is to be good with guns, the  Archer Hermit who's ability is to be able to use bows, Monk who's is to be able to take double rounds of attacking along with critting more often but is better without a weapon. Finally, there's Red Mages   incorrectly translated  for some reason the developer wanted to call them dreamer  who are what you expect with their only special ability being universal compatibility with equipment.  I personally prefer a Warrior, Monk, Hermit, Shaman setup. I've seen people recommend playing with 2 Warrior + 2 Shaman, but you will waste a lot of equipment that way since the warriors won't make use of any bows/guns/lighter armor while the Shaman will have difficulty until later in the game when you have more spells that you have picked up along with equipment as Shaman equipment isn't often came by, leaving them prone to getting randomly focused down by encounters. If you were to do a solo run I would recommend the Monk or Dreamer, but I don't really recommend you do a solo run as the game was not designed with that much in though  but you can make some mad bucks doing so  .    Progression is very clear and laid out but it's also laid out in such a way that you've got options. You don't have to find every quest, but you'll want to do at least a few around every area so that you aren't struggling against the grind. While the game isn't especially grindy it does punish death harshly (and oddly). Warriors cost far more to resurrect  which is also why having 1 warrior is nice to not have to foot a huge bill to the Witch Doctor  than other classes for some reason, and resurrecting costs big time after you've got a few levels on you. This is one of the most frustrating things about the game as you're first playing; you don't know where to go, what to fight, how to fight well, and what you do know to fight takes 15 minutes to safely level up on. On top of that there are no classes that start out with a heal so you will soon learn to stockpile on herbs until you find your first healing artifact  you did take at least 1 class with some MP...right?  . Once you make it to about level 15 or so the cost of reviving becomes quite low and there are 2 revive spells along with an artifact that will revive a second character if your party wipes, which greatly alleviates this pain. Still, I found this incredibly annoying before I was able to avoid beginner deaths.    Quests come in the form of a few decisions that result in different rewards. Now some rewards are clearly better but aren't available to compare until you actually make the decision and end up with an item or artifact that you would have rather traded in for the other. While you can keep playing with it and try to roll with the punches it gets a little bit too rough if you haven't geared up your warrior in a while and really need a new sword only to be given a gun when you have no explorer. Quests also give a little amount of experience but it's really all about the rewards. At the end of the game you get to see a different ending depending on your decisions for each quest, only a few have a single outcome. Also, there's no quest log so you gotta make sure you commit the information to memory.    Combat is about being prepared, not so much being smart. Some enemies have type resistances and the auto-fight option is quite stupid at times, but you will quickly realize what hits what harder. Bosses are not too hard if your party composition isn't terrible and you have a decent combination of levels, gear, and spells. That being said you need to get a non-item source of healing ASAP since there are no advanced healing items and herbs stop being very effective after level 5. Sometimes the enemies randomly target your backline and others they do nothing but hit your warrior. You'll want to have your warrior defend a lot later on in the game as you need to specialize each character's role in battle. Later in the game you will also be able to afford arrows and bullets more if you chose to take a bow or gun wielding character, but early in the game they're practically impossible to afford while not packing the bang for your buck.    Story wise the game is decent and pokes holes in traditional tropes of the genre while remaining faithful to the traditional RPG style of story like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. There's no overarching theme being pushed on the player that they are forced to adopt, but every consequence of your actions are visible, sometimes even only if after the end. You're best left to judge for yourself.   Other Stuff that annoyed me: -NPC blocking -Not being able to flee from encounters that I could wipe in 1 turn in auto -Some encounters have terrible experience relative to how much damage the enemies deal/take -Sometimes I don't get my stats restored when leveling up and I have no idea why -Poison is too strong -I've played this much and still find myself troubled to identify towns properly at times",

            "review_text": "One of a long line of Final Fantasy retries, and it has the same failings that pretty much all of them have, along with the same strong points. Strong points include an open world, LOTS of choices to make, and a combat system you'll either love or hate depending on how you feel about the old school Final Fantasy systems.  Weak points include awful balance, penalizing the player for not knowing what vague dialogue means (artifacts can't be exchanged between characters once acquired), and for me at least, I got rather bored of the game before I made it to the second boss. Almost all combat is best handled by just pushing the Auto(-Resolve) button and letting it play itself. No combat I encountered required any kind of thought or skill. Your mages will even cast the appropriate type of damage spell to maximize damage done against the targeted enemies! Though I did find my mage seemed to love casting the 'dump all remaining MP into one big spell' spell quite a lot.  It's also worth noting that the game plays at its native, itty bitty resolution and doesn't have any kind of explanation of controls or what buttons do in the game. I actually had to use Google to find answers about how to run the game in full screen, how to change party members, and all kinds of other things. All of the in-game menus (accessed by pressing F1) are in Japanese.  I can't recommend this game at its asking price. I think it'd be a decent enough buy for a few bucks, but even the $7 I paid for it felt like far more than it's worth. It's not a bad game, but it's not really a GOOD game, either.",

            "review_text": "All of the tropes that I have been born to despise from JRPG genre are near to non-existent in this perculiar gem, and thats what made it playable - in a genuine good way.   there are minimal spoilers here onwards, but I try to keep them to a minimal...    As much as I try to love the JRPG genre as a whole, introductions that last for 2-3 hours and an introduction to the combat system that makes me feel like an idiot for not knowing what a 'fight or flight' response even is, subverts any expectations of slaying demons, dragons, monster ♥♥♥♥♥es who are hell bent to kill you and make this adventure an empowerment fantasy - according to the trailers! What normally happens, is me beating up cucumbers to get some shabby gear - so I just giveup before even the mid-game.  But Artifact Adventure does not ♥♥♥♥ around and hand-hold you. You are given a descision to either get some Artifacts, The Key of Time, or an Airship. Literally the intro (without a tutorial! huzzah!) is like five text boxes and you can ♥♥♥♥ off to do whatever: such as retiring to a ship after selling off your party members to slavery, or get the Airship and hunt down some end-game loot, or just play the game traditionally. If my stigma for long and drawn out openings - mostly from JRPG's - hasn't sounded draconian to you, its like a breath of fresh air during an asthma attack.  Most JRPG's have a rather generic line of quests you could do. And what I mean is that its either fetch quets, kill some monsters or this mini-boss in some fiendish cavern slash derelict civilisation - or a bit of both. However, not only Artifact Adventure gives you different ways to end quests and recieve different rewards for replay value, but it gives you plenty of moral descisions as to what the hell you are doing. I have never seen so many Yes or No descisions that can effect me on the fourth wall. While the impact might be indeed small, it is more than enough effort to keep quests from ever becoming tedious.  And hey, its one of the few games that gives you decent rewards for being evil.  I also cannot stress enough how the game is designed to keep grinding to the barest minimal - just doing all of the quests from the nearest town - rince and repeat - and you might reach the Swamp King without tedious grind.  Pro tip: don't spam Guile of the Bandits or you may become underleveled if your not speed running.     ",

            "review_text": "If you grew up on the NES and miss your childhood days of playing the newest release(s) of the Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy series (8 bit, 16bit).,, GET THIS, it's like old NES all over again. It has everything the Dragon Warrior games had back in the day that made them fun, and then some. Enough new things mixed in to keep it FRESH - not so much NEW per say as just, how it was approached is a bit more 'daring', but this is a good thing. Play it and you'll find out what I mean.  It's only 30MB download :)  GFX 10/10 (for NES quality) Music 10/10 (again, NES quality) - really done with taste. Control 7/10, but that's only because I have to change the keymapping on my joystick manually. Fun Factor: 10000/10 :) It's really fun if you like the old games.  Also, considerable replay factor (though not always as much as the likes of newer games such as Fallout), through use of being able to choose party classes or selloff your party altogether, and also through use of the choices at the beginning of the game via the king's dialog.  This is definately a game to try if you still long for original NES/Famicom Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest in JPN).",

            "review_text": "It commiteth a sin: It seems to have a time mechanic. So if you take too long to get to certain places, or do certain things, they won't occur. That's right, it seems that you can run out of time.  I don't know this for sure, but it certainly has day night cycles, which surely implies there's a time mechanic. I really hate collection style games with time mechanics. It makes me tense, turns a game from fun into work, and leads to me putting the game down and never playing it again.  If you like hardcore time management games, this might be for you, I guess? It seems it's not for me, however. Unless the time mechanic is simply cosmetic, or cyclic in nature and not a counter.  I'm being told that I am wrong about this, but it still stressed me out enough that I put the game down.",
