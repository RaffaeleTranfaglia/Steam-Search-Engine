            "review_text": "There is no doubt that Trine 3 is somewhat disappointing given the pedigree of the series. The decision to implement full 3D has brought better environments at the cost of just about everything else. This is still a fun and easy to play adventure, but one that does not match the quality or intricacy of its predecessors. It does maintain the charm of the series but leaves players with a half-finished story. The platforming is enjoyable but slightly wonkier because of the 3D movement. Our three heroes are less capable because they have fewer abilities and this also means the gameplay is simpler. Trine 3 is still worth playing, but that additional dimension comes at a price.

            "review_text": "There are so many negative reviews about this game which is a bit disappointing. This game is definitely short, but I would say is worth the $20 all the same. What it lacks in length, it makes up for in entertaining content. This game is played best with friends, going slow and just taking it all in. (I can’t stress this enough: all the Trine games are significantly more enjoyable with friends.) Beautifully polished environments and hilarious and interesting gameplay make this game one of my favorite co-op games of all time. (The other Trine games are also on my list of favorite co-op games.)  On a different note, I see quite a few people also complaining about bugs. I have found a couple of spots in the map where hitboxes do not line up perfectly with the models, but I didn’t find any game breaking bugs in my playthrough. Additionally, I also see quite a few people complaining about the lack of abilities in this game that were present in Trine 2. I feel a lot of those abilities would not work very well in 3D, but I agree that it would have been cool to see a larger variety of abilities in this game. That being said, the game was still fun and interesting without a larger variety of abilities.  However, I completely understand if you still don't want to spend $20 on a game that you can just rush through and beat in 4 hours; if that is the case, I highly recommend buying the first two Trine games if you haven't already done so. Both of them are fairly short (although longer than this game); but, they are both extraordinary games with cheap price tags (especially on sales.)",

I do recommend new players get the trine bundle for the best dollar to hour value, since the games length is its only real negative to me. However the enviroments are interesting and beautiful. The puzzles are clever, and the platforming is fun. It manages to evolve into a 3d game without sacrifising the feel of a 2.5d game. I really hope the developer is able to take the feedback and make a bigger and better built sequel.",

            "review_text": "I'm not much of a reviewer, but after reading the response to Trine 3 I felt I should also put in my two cents. Because I really liked Trine 3. Despite being very different from the previous games in the series, Trine 3 still has the beauty and the soul I came to know and love. The gameplay has changed (pretty drastically), but that is not necessarily a bad thing. This is what I thought was positive, neutral, and negative;  The positive:  - The storytelling. Now, it is true that the story in Trine 3 has an open ending (which I agree with other reviewers is a negative point). However, the part of the story that is told is told magnificently. The story of Trine 3 tackles the origin of the Trine and the other artifacts of power. Personally, I was completely engaged by the story, much more so than I was by the stories of Trine and Trine 2. I really hope there will be another game to finish the tale. - Visuals. The Trine games are all beautiful, this one being no exception. Everything is as colorful and fairytaleish as ever. I particularly loved the extra detail poured into the appearance of the three heroes. With each installment they've become more recognizable, which I consider a big plus. The first Trine was about a Thief, a Wizard and a Knight. Trine 3 is about Zoya, Amadeus and Pontius. Also, one level (I believe level 6) takes places within the pages of a book - rarely have I seen any part of a game that beautiful. Wow. - The music. There's really not much to say about this; it's amazing. The soundtrack was made by the same person who made the soundtracks of Trine and Trine 2, and he has yet again failed to disappoint. - The single character levels. In the main storyline levels of Trine 3, you can play as all three characters, just like in the previous games. However, Trine 3 also features plenty of non-story levels in which you only control one character. There are a few level focusing only on combat (most of which you play as Pontius, but also one as Amadeus) and each character has two mini-levels focused around that character alone. Pontius was separated from his companions, and his two levels focus on him getting back to them. Zoya's levels detail her search for the giant emerald she was chasing at the beginning of the game, and Amadeus takes a nap and goes on a quest for the elusive fireball spell in his dreams. I thought these levels were really quirky and fun.  The neutral:  - The 3D. On one hand, it is a refreshing change from the first two Trine games. The extra dimension really adds to the puzzle aspects of the game, opening a whole new dimension (literally) of possibilities. On the other hand, the camera sometimes acts wonky and missing a platform and dying is very easy. The 3D is great for the puzzles, less great for the platforming. - The character's abilities. Like many other reviewers, I was sad to see the variety of hero-specific tools and powers diminished. Zoya no longer has any special arrows, Pontius has lost his hammer, and Amadeus can now only conjure one box at a time. However, there are some new abilities I really came to like. Zoya's rope (grappling hook) has become much more advanced. She can now tie both ends of the rope to two different objects, which is very helpful for solving puzzles. And, my favorite change, Amadeus is now actually useful in battle. I had tons of fun smashing boxes down on enemies, and he was actually my go-to combat character this time around. - Having to collect Trineangles (which were experience bottles in Trine and Trine 2) to unlock levels. As a collector and achievement hunter, I never even move on to another level until I'm sure I've collected everything in the previous level, but I can imagine other players being frustrated by this. If you do not have enough Trineangles to unlock the next level, you will have to replay a previous level to collect more. The Trineangles, however, are a lot less hard to find than experience bottles, so it should not take too long to collect enough. - There are a few minor bugs. Zoya glitches a bit when she has her bow drawn, sometimes you can phase though part of a wall, that sort of thing. I found nothing game-breaking, however, and the little bugs I found did not keep me from enjoying the game. I have read that there were some issues with multiplayer, but having only played solo, I cannot comment on them. Single player works like a charm, at least.  The negative:  - The lack of challenge. In the first Trine game, there were a few achievements that took some extra effort, like getting through a level without taking any damage. Trine 2 was achievement galore, and I spent many hours chasing the final hard and frustrating, but satisfying achievements. Trine 3, however, is already a fairly easy game, and there are no achievements which require you to do anything particularly special - just complete the game and collect everything. I finished the game (and collected all achievements) in about 7.5 hours. Compared to Trine 2 (40 hours) and even the first Trine (13.5 hours), that is very little time. This is not because the game itself is too much shorter than the first two games, but because there is no extra challenge. I would have loved to see some achievements requiring you to finish the game on a hard difficulty, or even some of the wacky achievements from the first two games that force you to go out of your way to do silly things like making an enemy sail on an improvised raft. - The ending. It's been said by many others, and I can only confirm it. The game ends in the middle of the story, which makes it seem unfinished. From the forum I've understood that the developers planned on this from the beginning, but failed to inform their fans. Now, I did not buy Trine 3 immediately after its release, so I had time to read the reviews before purchasing the game and I knew what to expect from the ending. However, I can imagine that those who did buy the game right off the bat were bitterly disappointed by the lack of proper ending. So, if you want to buy Trine 3, do be noted that the ending is completely open and the fate of the heroes is left ambiguous. - There is no leveling. While I was neutral on the characters' abilities being mixed up, I was disappointed by the fact that all abilities are unlocked for every character from the start. The reward of unlocking extra powers for characters (rather than the much more tedious task of having to collect things to unlock levels) is, I think, what made many players chase collectibles happily. Now the collecting has become a chore, as the awesome reward of new abilities has been replaced by the unlocking of levels - which I believe we are already entitled to, as we bought the game, and therefore doesn't feel like a reward at all.  So, in conclusion, Trine 3 is indeed very different from Trine and Trine 2, and fans of the previous games are not by default guaranteed to like this one. However, in my opinion, different is not the same as worse in this case. Trine 3 is still a beautiful, quirky game with a lovely story, great characters and wonderful music. As long as you're aware that Trine 3 is not like its predecessors, the game is very enjoyable. I hope FrozenBite will be able to make another addition to the series to give us a satisfying conclusion to the heroes' journey.",

The things that many people didn't like is the length (which I'm totally fine with and maybe understandable when you bought it for the full price but on sale it is worth it), bugs (may only be in multiplayer,i didn't have any) and the missing skill system but in my opinion it is fine since the levels are build around the skill you have from the start.",

            "review_text": "Trine 3 is the first in Trine series to be featuring a platformer in 3D. It's beautiful, as usual, and as to be expected from Frozenbytes. The scenery is breathtaking, and given that this is 3D makes it even better. And Soundtrack, of course, Akki really is a leading example how a composer should've been. Nothing less than magnificent. Soundtrack is included in Trine 3 folder as 192 kbps files (quite disappointing though they're not lossless, but better than nothing).  The next point... gameplay, unfortunately for gameplay... is very lacking. Game length is also very short. To be quite honest, despite the missing features, I still think it's a good game. The platformer essence is still there, although nerfed in many ways. In battle it's Pontius' chance here to shine, though, the other two are quite useless. Quite possibly this is major negative points that many players hate.  For Trine 4, I hope they can incorporate back the older features like tech trees/skills like before.  Still, I prefer to recommend the game, for me to give them negative would hurt the developer unnecessarily. I think they've heard the feedback from us playerbase loud enough, and they'll try to amend it. Remember how they treated older Trines and gave updates many times? Let's give them a chance.  Looking forward to Trine 4.",

Ofcourse there is the standard problem that i beleive everyone has noticed which is the game is both short and ends on a significant cliffhanger. Which is a true shame since the story the built up to such a grand point and by the time Frozen gets back on their feet to produce the rest of it, it'll probly be forgotten.",

Zoya Can only fire one measly arrow but her grapple can now be used to pull and attach lines, but there are no fire or explosion or ice now they kept the acid though. As Pontius you start with the kite shield but lose the hammer and magnetism. One final caveat, This is only half a story which I presume will be finished with trine 4 or trine 3 the complete story. Despire all the things that have changed it really made a nice transition to 3D and it is prettier than ever. On top of that they finally get around to explaining the trine and it's 2 sister components, the story feels like a half finished legend but that's where you come in.

The mechanics are pretty nice (despite there being no upgrades, which I miss), and, since it exited early access, the bugs are very few and far between.   The reason that I decided to change my review from a negative to a positive one is because I would like to see more of this game, which will only happen if the developers get the support they need. It would be stupid if a game which was criticised for being too short had to remain short only because it was criticised for it. They were (and hopefully, still are) planning to make more of this story, but they could only bring out so much to start with (which the marketers did NOT make clear in early access), hence the cliff hanger ending.  It really is a nice concept. They've taken a 2D platforming game and turned it into a 3D one, which is still beautiful and still works well, and I, as a long time fan of the whole series, would really like to see some more of the Trine series made. I was a bit annoyed when it first came out about how much money I'd paid for such a short game, but it IS worth it to support the developers, and it IS a very good game.     Gameplay:  7/10 (because there are no upgrades, but otherwise it's very nice to play)   Graphics and look:  9/10 (It IS beautiful. Fleeting, but beautiful.)   Length:  4/10 (4 hours and I would have liked 10)   Overall:  6/10 (because it's too short and there are no upgrades to work towards, but if it was made longer this would definitely be an 8 or 9/10)",

Trine 3 has different gameplay (It's still a 'sidescroller' but you can freely run across the ground and not just left and right). It's still puzzles, still a platformer, the same heroes, none of the weird bonus/alt powers. Still lots of fun to play.  But I just finished the main story and it seemed to hint at a continuation.... but where is it? I hope they make the next part soon.",

            "review_text": "Rating: 7/10 Overview: Pseudo 3D Platformer.    The Good:  + Like previous games, the graphics, cinematography and atmosphere is pure visual eye candy  + easy achievements  + levels track collectables within each checkpoint so its easy to replay levels and collect what you missed  + level editor/ steam workshop provides some replay ability   The Average:  Unlike previous games, this is 3D. It adds some depth to the game but it doesn’t add a whole lot. Its as if the developers wanted to make a full 3D game but were too afraid, so they made the levels extremely linear and easy.   Platforming is a bit trickier now  The previous games had a nice balance between platforming, puzzle solving and combat. This game is focused more on platforming, and a weaker emphasis on puzzle solving and combat.    The Bad:   -The game is really short, only 7 main levels, and they can easily be completed in 30 minutes with a story that is incomplete. You are looking at a 3-5 hour game depending on skill level.   - Features are missing from the previous games; No more items to equip your characters, character no longer level up, levels are much easier, less reliant on physics.   Conclusion:  The trine games are fantastic yet this game is largely forgettable. If the developers do decide to make another game, either make a fully 3-D world or just stick to 2-D. Its not that this is a bad game per se, its just lacking so much content from the previous games. Get it on sale or in a bundle.  ",

Don't let others taint your opinion on an otherwise enjoyable puzzle platformer. That aside, if you absolutely must have an opinion to base your own off of, my experience with the game was a very enjoyable level design, coupled with some off-putting tech problems. Despite having a decent PC, the load times were irritating, but quickly forgotten in the very well-done story missions. The side missions punctuate every failure with a load screen, which quickly drained my patience. The fluid visuals and witty use of space throughout every level is something to be proud of, but the game left me wanting more. Seriously, this game cuts off so abruptly that I went back to check for anything I might have missed, thinking that I might find the other half of the game. Nope. None to be found. Trine 3 is fantastic while it lasts, then ends with a drunken stumble rather than a big finale.

This game, and the Trine series at large, have a wonderful take on solving puzzles, which is one of a surprisingly freeing laissez faire, they leave you an entire kit of tools at your disposal, and ask you to use them as you see fit, and as a result me and my good friend broke a lot of the puzzles in what were clearly unintended solutions, having a blast doing so.  This game is also rocking the pretty in a big bad way, if you're anything like me, you'll find yourself stopping at various points just to admire the scenery or the unusual flora and fauna that populate it. Even the things that really aren't there to be interacted with at all have a certain care in their design you rarely see even in large budget games.  Two things though, this game is short, shorter feeling than the others in the series, even, so if you're looknig for 60 hours, this isn't for you, and it ended abruptly and unsatisfyingly, leaving it feeling like half a game. I get the feeling there was the intention to do more, but it got held over for another game, These are pretty bad sticking points, but they don't make the overall product not a worthwhile experience.  I feel I should also address the 3D perspective issue that a lot of people seem to have. Some of the anger I've seen over this I feel can be attested to just the series deviating from it's expected status quo by eschewing the 2D puzzle feel, and I didn't consider it much harder to control, and never really felt myself losing grip on where I was in the depth of field, but I could see a genuine case being made against it, as occasionally there were some frustrating moments with sliding something onto a switch or panel in three-dimensional space. It allowed for the inclusion of some pretty cool puzzles as well though, like moving Zoya's rope around posts and the like to tie things together, and still felt mostly very well thought out.  Overall even though it has it's problems and it just kind of ends, I still had a really good time playing, and I wouldn't want to rob anyone of that by not recommending it.",

The game is beautifully executed in the graphics department and fun so two big ticks there.   The let downs are in the gameplay specifically the lack of ability to move the camera, massive oversight for a 3D game, and I mean MASSIVE.   Other detractors are the lack of character development and loss of skills from earlier Trine games.  Pluses are, it's beautiful, new ways to solve puzzles and it's a noticeably different experience. Not going to comment on length of game because it's adequate. I mean I completed Tomb Raider in like 15 hrs and that cost me $70 at the time.  In short for me it's a solid 8/10 game.

The game itself is not bad but it is clear that the devs ran out of time, money or both and decided to wrap up what they had so far.  Pros:  - Added 3d platforming, you'll either love it or hate it - Ingenuous use of physics and dynamics, especially with Zoya and rope. It really opened new platforming challanges which is awesome. - Respawning will most of the time right where you left off - Imaginative level design as usual, with really nice touch on the graphics especially on later levels, kudos  Cons:  - Playability suffers. Mainly because the depth perception is not always clear, especially when jumping. This is partially the fault of the camera angle and partially lack of shadow on the ground showing where you will land. You do get mostly used to it though. - Skill tree is gone. Guess we were spoiled in Trine 1 and 2.  - Bit to easy compared to the previous games - Story is unfinished. The game does not even pretend that after the last level the story is wrapped up; it feels like an episodic ending which is a decent way to spin it if you need to rush the game to the market. - Short, finished along with all achievements in 7h.  If you are interested in playing this, give Trine 1 &amp; 2 a try first if you haven't. It's not required but it will give you a much better idea how great Trine games really are.

The game is a lot of fun to play through, the puzzles are not as hard as in the previous games, making it more opened to those who don't like solving puzzles a lot, but still full of excitement and funny moments.  The only thing the game lacks are boss battles. All previous titles of the series contained a big amount of boss fights. In this adventure the boss fight is only one, and it is found at the end of the game!  Unfortunately the game is not complete, and where it ends is only the begining what our Heroes have to do and face, but the game is as long as any other Trine adventure, giving to players a lot of playtime, enough puzzles and collectibles with enhanced visuals and great storyline, something Trine never lacks!

I was very hesitant... waiting to see if patches would fix all the issues people were talking about. In the end i thought 'stuff it i'll buy it and make up my own mind'.   So glad i did... i liked the changes they made. It wasn't perfect adding that 3D depth of field element but i could see what they were trying to do... It took a little getting used to playing the new style of game play... but in the end i was happy with my purchase and played it from start to finish. They did remove a few concepts which were great in 1 and 2 which was a bit disappointing and it was probably a bit short too.   I give it a 6.5 out of 10.",

            "review_text": "Trine and Trine 2: Goblin Menace are among my favorite games. They have gorgeous graphics, smooth gameplay with unique characters encompassing different skillsets, and very interesting puzzles making use of the physics engine. Without forgetting a great cooperative experience, local or online.  Seeing how Trine and Trine 2 were such great games, I thought that Trine 3 would be a direct continuation and I would be enchanted once more. I was wrong. So wrong.   The culprit? Transition from a 2.5D game (3D game playing in 2D) to a 3D game with depth. Suddenly the controls went from smooth to clunky and too complex, and the fixed camera angles do not allow to correctly appreciate the distance of elements that are far away, leading to many unfair deaths. Many deaths including falling outside the bonds of the level. Like, getting too close to the camera and falling into the foreground.  To develop my gripe with the controls, I will give an example. WASD keys used to move the character left, right, down and jump. With the grappling hook, the thief would swing from left to right using A and D, and change the length of the cord with W and S. Now, W and S are used to move towards and away from the camera, so to move in the depth. Jump thus has to be on the space bar instead of W. The thief can still use her grappling hook (on very few surfaces bearing a ring, gone is the relative freedom of the previous entries), but W and S are used to swing towards and away from the camera. So now on top of the previous keys and the new key for jump, mousewheel up and down are used to change the length of the cord. This means that something which was very fluid with 4 inputs and one hand now requires 7 inputs and two hands. Same with the other actions such as swimming and using magic boxes with the wizard: everything is more annoying to use because of the 3D.   And add to the madness of the controls the issues that come with depth perception. Am I aligned with the platform I want to jump on? I think so. I jump. I fall right behind it, instantly die in toxic water and have to start over the whole level. Yes start over, I will come back to those levels without checkpoints later. Overall the 3D perspective either obfuscates elements that should be plainly visible, such as a foreground with a passage only revealed if the character moves very close to the camera, or, as I said, does not clearly convey the distances, and a single slip of the W and S keys for depth can kill the player in a very unfair way. And the levels are contained within a bottomless abyss which is very easy to fall in while exploring or miscalculating a jump that seemed legitimate.   Just these two complaints, clunky controls and depth issues, are the reason why I cannot recommend this game in good faith. I did not have fun playing most of the levels because of this. The only level I enjoyed a lot, the one taking place inside of a book, was the closest to a 2.5D Trine experience. Switching the game from 2.5D to 3D also increased the cost of making the game for the development team Frozenbyte, and it really looks like they had to release it as soon as possible. Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries had exactly the same problem, trying to have full 3D in the game skyrocketed the costs, and the development team GRIN had no more money to continue making the game. So 3D increases the cost, while reducing the enjoyment of the players... Not a great deal. In the event that Frozenbyte would still want to include 3D to the Trine series to spice it up, I recommend looking up games that did 3D platforming well, such as the Mario games, Rayman 3 or somewhat Alice Madness Returns. In any case, the camera should follow the character, not be locked in weird perspectives that make the platforming horrendous. Lastly, I would suggest looking at Crash Bandicoot that managed to mix 2D phases and a 2D feel to 3D phases. In any case, sticking to 2.5D is just fine.  My next complaint about the game is actually not about the length (or lack of experience points and a skill tree), unlike many players. It took me 8h for 100% and I wouldn't want more of this 3D mess. No, my complaint is about the way that the progression system was handled. Before even entering the Astral Academy I had unlocked side levels that were taking place in the academy... Overall the story felt completely disjointed, and the ending did not resolve ANY of the quests, making it feel like a botched up 'woops, we're out of budget, let's stop here'. Because of the Trineangles to collect in side levels to continue some of the main levels, the progression was not fluid at all.  Talking about these side levels. They star one of the three characters alone, the way some of them (Knight) are introduced makes little sense with the rest of the story, and they have no checkpoints. Death means restarting. I am fine with some short bonus levels with an extra challenge, but having to suffer through the same clumsy physics puzzles over and over, just to get back to the part where I keep dying because the perspective messes my jumps, makes for an infuriating game experience.  So, is there something that I want to redeem from this game? Well Trine 3 is gorgeous, with some new beautiful levels to go through such as the shipwreck and the unique amazing level that takes place in the book and radically changes the art style for its duration. Also, the last boss fight was really nice.  In conclusion, I do not recommend Trine 3, it is clearly not as good as the other Trine games because of the inclusion of 3D and a camera angle not suitable to appreciate depth (survival horror games also dropped that system!). Even if it lacks a lot of polish I would not say that it is a catastrophic bad game, but it remains a problem that I had so little enjoyment in playing it. I still love the Trine series and hope for more of it, so I really hope that Frozenbyte will not have funding issues or drop Trine. Perhaps they could do a kickstarter if that is the case, as long as they convince me that they don't go for 3D or take a different approach than this one!",

Sadly this game is also a mess, you can't have a platform game in 3d with such poor perspective, unresponsive controls and no camera control, it makes something as simple as jumping straight ahead a hard task. I mean, I have fallen to my death so many times it's just funny now. 'Let's jump to that box... weeey... THE ABYSS! WHO PUT THE ABYSS THERE? AAARGH! x-x'. RIP, Zoya, for the 100th time, you will be missed :( It's also kinda buggy at times, the kind of buggy that stops you from playing because a video event won't load and you can't continue that level without starting from zero. And allegedly it ends on a cliffhanger because of poor planning, which is a shame. So I would only get this one if it's on a BIG sale, and you have high tolerance for frustration, jumping to places you didn't really want to jump and awful controls in general. In that case, you will enjoy the prettiness and it's short enough that it won't get too annoying.",

Similarly, in contrast to the other games in the trine series wherein each character had powers only they could use, adding depth to the multi-player feature, in this game the wizard can literaly do EVERYTHING. He can kill all enemies in one hit, break any wall, or solve any puzzle by literally flying on a box. That's right, if you jump on a box, then jump again and pull the box under yourself, you can jump infinitely providing endless flight, Bypass any puzzle? Get any collectible? Skip half the level? The wizard does it all! Respawning at certain checkpoints in the game, such as the 'Undead Ambush' section of the arcane school, means that all characters are caught in a loop of endless death and you have to return to the map.

Pros -Xbox Controller support changed and made it a little easier to play with the telekinesis power Armadeus has -Zoya's still hot af  Cons -This bs 3-dimensional crap not only gives me motion sickness, but makes the game freaking annoying to play -Where the frick are the skills, like planks and fire arrows and hammer?? -The wall and item glitches make this game a freaking nightmare -Looks unreasonably short compared to the first two games  I feel so betrayed by the developers for making this game because of the cons. I really wish the Trine series could have ended on a better note. What was wrong with the 2-dimensional platforming in the first 2 games? Why did they just suddenly create this mess of a platformer? You can play Trine 1 and Trine 2 and feel satisfied with both of their endings, but Trine 3 really just ruins the whole series. I wish I could recommend this game, but I can't. It just ruined something that was already perfect.",

The game is very short, you're done after approx. 4 hours. Although the levels look very detailed, they don't have much love in them and it feels if the devs were under heavy time pressure when creating them.  The puzzles are non-existant or are so easy that I didn't even notice one of them.  If you are a fan of previous trine-titles please don't buy this. If you do it will only give the devs reason to continue with this rapid trash developments to get some quick cash out of the money. The fans must make clear that we do not accept such actions, again don't buy this game!",

It was somewhat fun, but I was waiting the entire game to get skills (Ice arrow, Fire arrow, Mage stuff) or at lease new mechanics. The game mechanics were always the same and overly simple.  I finished the game in ~5 hours and it was enough to find a lot of bugs. What annoyed me the most were the glitch graphics that made my entire machine freeze for some seconds constantly, I had to tune down the graphics.  The ending was really annoying as well, it didn't end! This feeling is really annoying, I am most likely never going to buy any DLC to see the ending, no way... That was ridiculous. I will only play if they release a DLC for free apologizing.  I'm sorry to any team member that is reading this, but I feel really frustrated and I hope you understand. The game has potential, it might have been just way too soon to release.",

            "review_text": "Do not buy this game. Very disappointing sequel to an otherwise excellent franchise. Trine 3 attempts to a third dimension to a 2D platformer, which is so poorly implemented as to make the game frustratingly unplayable. The difficulty of the game is not in the intricacy of the puzzles, or clever level layout, but rather through gimicky, flimsy controls which leads to monotonous repitition.   - Previously it was possibly to aim the assassin's arrow because the environment only had two dimensions, now the game will automatically select a target based roughly on the character's heading.  - The same problem happens with the wizard, where you cannot tell which object is going to be affected by the levitation power until you press the button. You can no longer select objects with a cursor, instead game selects whatever arbitrary object is nearby to manipulate, or require you to toggle between multiple selectable objects if more than one exists on screen at a time. Once selected, manipulating objects in 3D space is ludicrously difficult, especially with a gamepad.   - Many obstacles need to be solved by placing objects ot jumping 'into' the screen (along the Z axis), but without depth cues this is mostly just random guesswork.  - When characters die a blue ghost avatar floats to a random location in the world. The character is resurrected by standing in or near the blue avatar for some time. Sometimes this is in an impossible to reach location (eg. a location requiring the assassin, who is dead), or in the middle of an infinitely spawning battle (eg. requiring the knight, who is dead). Invariably this means forcibly killing the remaining characters and rewinding the game to a previous checkpoint, which are far and few between. In the earlier versions of the game, characters would be resurrected immediately when passing a checkpoint.",

I simply can't imagine how anyone would have thought a transition into a more 3 dimensional world would do the gameplay any good. Even though the difficulty of the game is anything but hardcore, it gets so frustrating to repeatedly miss jump after jump, just because there is no indicator, where you might be landing. And while jumping is the most basic action you will perform every few seconds during the game, it is even more anoying to try and place boxes, swing on ropes, shoot arrows oder pull objects to a specific location because it's just hit and miss all the time.  And what's even more frustrating are those damned pyramids, which you have to collect, since you need a certain amount of them to unlock levels in the game. But since those things are sometimes hidden in places like boxes without any indication of them beeing in there, it results in you flailing wildly while jumping through the stages in basicaly uncontrolable patterns just so you don't have to play a level again because you missed one of them.   Seriously though: Even with all the mixed and bad reviews I still wanted Trine 3 to be good, just because I adored the first two installments. Those were genuinely great platformers. Do yourself a favor and just buy and play those two, instead of wasting your money on this one.",

They ♥♥♥♥ing removed ability tree, so there is no perspective of getting stronger, and no cool skills anymore (I really missed the gravity arrows and the multiple boxes). The other thing that killed the game, is the story, VERY short, and ends literally in the middle of it, out of nowhere. I'm very sad, the game had everything to be phenomenal, the 3D it is confusing at the start, but very immersive, the soundtrack is awesome as always, and the graphics are stunning, but they ♥♥♥♥ed up what should be a really great game. It's with a heavy heart that I'm giving the game a negative review, so the Developers can see that the game need some upgrades. If they launch a free dlc with skills and more story, I will change this review with no time.",

Also this game has no skills levels, no extra skills (plank, ice arrows etc are gone). The levels are pretty easy and the 'puzzles' are repetitive. There's no more healing or xp for killing monsters so you might as well just run past them. Each character heals to full health after taking no damage for a while. It's just not challenging or engaging. And the game ends in the middle of the story.",

The camera moves on its own in specific areas and you end up losing your character behind walls.  Why would you take away hero upgrades/perks? So many abilities that makes the game fun are gone.
