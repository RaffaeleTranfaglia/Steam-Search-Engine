            "review_text": "Both positive and negative points for this game.  Pros: -Huge variety of creatures to tame, which you can ride or have run around as pets with you- most creatures are tameable, and it does tell you which ones are and are not. -The avaliable mounts look pretty awesome. -When you get all familiars in an area you can claim rewards. -Daily rewards that are actually helpful! -Don't start off as a nobody; you're a well-known warrior. -Classes are a fun challenge to learn and look cool. -Amazing graphics. -Mounted combat and normal combat are both features; generally you can choose which you want to do, although aerial mounted combat is a little more tricky. -Dungeon armour is avaliable at the auction house (albeit for exorbitant prices) thanks to other players, meaning if you don't have time or can't be bothered to grind the dungeon for ages then you can buy the armour.  Cons: -Can only create 3 characters -Repeated disconnects from servers -Teleportation costs (not too expensive, certainly, but if you go broke and can't afford it it can be a mild inconvenience, just means travelling on mountback for a while until you have enough money) -Takes ages to gather resources for certain familiars, even then not a guaranteed chance of taming. (Same as most MMOs in that sense, but it can get a little infuriating when you spend several hours getting resources to craft an item and fail the taming.) -When lag hits it hits bad and at the worst of times -Not everything in the trailers has been implemented in the game yet, although hopefully it will be eventually. -The leveling seems to get a bit wonky at some points, although that might just be my own inexperience not knowing about it. It doesn't make the main story impossible, just means it takes longer to get to the same level as the entities around you. -You CANNOT do a solo route, the game forces you to interact with other players to get good armour in dungeons. (edit; you can, as a person in the comments has thankfully added on quite kindly, if you're willing to have non-heroic gear for a while.)  The graphics are excellent, cutscenes are good and overall a good game considering it's free. Very fun.",

            "review_text": "I've been looking for a FTP MMO to scratch the WoW itch for a number of years. Having a subscription meant that I felt like I HAD to play WoW to get that money's worth, which was a big part of the addiction for me. I convinced myself (hitting rock-bottom may have had something to do with it) that cancelling my sub and waiting for WoW to go FTP was the only course of action. That was many years ago. In that time, I have played GW2, Tera, Wildstar, the Perfect World, ESO, LOTR Online, Star Trek Online, SWTOR, Aion, the list goes on. If it's an MMO, I've played it, in the hopes of filling that void that WoW left. Nothing even clame close to comparing.  Then I came across Riders of Icarus. I started a Guardian class, and I fell in love. I got the feels, the dreams of the game while I slept, waking only to think about strats and what I would accomplish in game that day. I joined a guild and met people that actually helped, and were happy to give up their time to grind dungeons with me. I began to scour wikipedia to learn as much as I could about this game, and became a wealth of knowledge to my guildmates. Finding ways to counter botters in-game, memorizing locations of rare spawns, bosses and item drops. I found ways to farm gold and crafting mats. I found ways to profit on the AH. Days went by, 3 days after the game's release, I'd amassed 36 hours of game time. I was hooked. I'd found my WoW replacement; hell, in ways it was beginning to outshine WoW. But best of all? It's free to play.   Yes, it's a Nexon game. Just don't make purchases with real currency in-game, and you won't have any issues. (It's FTP anyway, serves pay to winners right).  Yes, botters are a problem, but you can create your own channel, and specify what displays in that channel. As for bots camping spawns, the system works on first hit. The bot timers for this are good, but not perfect. Just get the first hit in through spamming your auto-attack. Changing channels also works for this most times.  Yes, the quests are mostly kill x, gather x, escort x, but at no point did I become bored, at no point did the grind become tedious.  As I've progressed through the game, I've been repeatedly impressed by the difficulty of it. I've marvelled at the beauty of the scenery around me. I've experienced little to no lag (a miracle for an Aust player) I've grown attached to Elite pets and mounts that I've sought out and tamed, I've been saddened at saying goodbye to pets and mounts that had outlived their usefulness or been made redundant by better, stronger, faster mounts, with higher HP and Energy pools.  But my journey has only just begun.   I'm moving interstate for work IRL, and the week between moving out of the house that I currently occupy and the house that I'm moving to before I can access stable internet again will be difficult to endure. But I will be back. I will return to this amazing world, and I will grow stronger. I haven't even come close to discovering all that this game has to offer, and I can only imagine the lands and content that await me when I return.   Visuals: 9.5/10  Gameplay: 8.5/10  Story: 9/10  Overall: 9/10 - It's Free to Play, what are you waiting for? Download it and see for yourself.  Gotta Tame Em' All!  *edited for grammar/spelling and a more detailed solution to botters.",

            "review_text": "Riders of Icarus is pleasant on the eyes and ears. As a new MMORPG, one of its selling points is the taming system ie. the ability to tame most of the creatures of the world and use them as mounts or companions. For the most part, it is pretty run of the mill - with kill/gather questing around a vibrant and colourful world with occasional visits to a throwaway storyline. As someone who loves checking out MMORPGs (FTP or otherwise), this doesn't phase me.  However, RoI has the misfortune of being plagued by several minor annoyances that can hamper immersion somewhat. While the combat itself works relatively well, the controls (especially mouse related) come up a bit short. For one, you cannot left-click drag the camera for some strange reason, nor does the cursor disappear when holding down RMB. Combat itself can be swapped between tab-target (traditional) mode, and action-combat mode - neither feeling 100% comfortable given traditional mode has very sticky targetting, often forcing ESC use, whilst AC-Mode isn't nearly as fluid as it should be and still feels very clicky and tab-target based. Having the option to swap between either one on a whim is a plus, though I do believe the developers really should have picked one method and refined it to perfection rather than try to cater for two.  The game can be very pleasing look at at times, yet for some reason they've opted for many low-res textures in a lot of areas that look very out of place. Sound (music especially) is inoffensive, easy on the ears and very suited to the environments and gameplay, though there are a few minor gripes here as well, such as some creatures being entirely soundless, even when hitting you, being hit by you, or dying. There are some sound-channel issues as well, such as sounds or dialogue randomly cutting out, which can be a bit jarring when it happens. The voice acting is passable, though there are some NPC's who seem to flit between voice-actors - such as the first city Stewart who randomly goes from a high pitched chap to some gruff, old voice out of the blue.  There are a lot more pros and cons to list, but the whole ordeal can be summarized like this: Given RoI is entirely free-to-play (with no noticable P2W), then give it a try if it looks appealing to you -- but don't expect perfection. I'll be eager to see how long it takes for the developers to employ patches to remedy issues within the game (if they bother at all) but thus far, it's not in terrible shape for an Open Beta.",

            "review_text": "I love this game! If you like the traditional style MMO and collecting mounts/pets, then this is the game for you. It even throws in a little action combat if you want it (though it's kinda a mix between traditional and Tera combat because you still have to tab target mobs if there is more than one in combat with you).   You can go around and tame almost everything you see and turn it into your pet that fights with you or your mount. You have to hit a button, jump on the back of the mob, and hit WASD (whichever lights up). However, just know that even if you get the buttons right, it may still fail and you'll have to try again...so you have to have good ol' RNG on your side! Some monsters require more than that, though, such as farming an item that drops from another mob or dropping off a small cliff and onto it's back.  Oh, and also... MOUNTED COMBAT!  So far, nothing game breaking in the cash shop.  Because it just released, there are a few minor bugs here and there, but I haven't come across anything that bad yet.  The devs are also updating quite a bit, which is nice, a big update it due here soon at the end of the month.   So honestly, I'm not sure why the mixed reviews, other than, yeah, the first day there was a long queue. Yes, it's a traditional-style MMO, but I personally don't find that to be a bad thing.",

            "review_text": "Simply put I love this game. The battle system is great, instead of just buying a mount its go out and pick one and tame it. Amazing fun. Questing to me doesn't feel repeatitive at all unless, well unless I'm doing the ones you can repeat a few times for elluns or the such. When it comes to the Classes I feel they did a decent job on the mix. Beserker- 'BEEFY' dps, Guardian- Tank (the best class *no bias here*) Assassin- MY opinion would be your Crit dps class, Quick full of crit hits. But unlike other games there is no invisible, hiding in the shadows. This assassin is more of the made you look this way but im behind you. still really fun. Priest- Healer Interestingly enough Priests are very OP in this game and can easily solo quiet a bit. Last but not least Wizard- long range dps. Wizards have uber dps but low health, low armor. Glass cannon to the T. Getting each class in a party is great as each one bring a buff to help the others out, not to mention increase in drop rate exp. Play well, play together. The problem is getting groups for the lower dungeons as it seems everyone just wants a higher level to come carry them through.  My two biggest complaints are the RNG and the rolls on gear. Seriously getting wizard gear with 3 slots of strength after a hellish run is a kick in the balls. This happens A LOT and look on auction for something decent, its like bro come on im on the second dungeon theres no way i have that much gold. oh ♥♥♥♥ i just blocked that last gold seller. ( IM KIDDING)  THE RNG in the game, I played warframe for awhile and its worse then running a T4 and getting forma. Like this RNG wants your first born before giving you the good stuff. which is usually the tames.  On a brighter note though all the heroic tames in the game if you fail 10 times will give you a mark for 100% so when your done crying over lost those 10 marks go get that heroic tame and flaunt it.",

            "review_text": "Alright, where to begin? After quitting WoW for a couple of years, I had looked else where in terms of genre for games. Played a few mobas, Rocket League, yadda yadda. But this game here really brought something refreshing to me. I have loved every hour of the few that I have played.  Pros: - Graphically appealing - Runs SMOOTH on a gtx 970 @ 60 FPS 1080p - Combat is fresh and fluent  - Two different combat styles (One an action RPG, the other like classic WoW) - Early game mounts (Instant with any founders pack, Level 5 for everyone else) - Easy to learn crafting - Already know the gathering/crafting skills - Easy transportation with world shrines at every local HUB - Auction Houses - Ingame currency can be obtained through quests/login rewards/achievements - ingame currency is NOT pay to win, allows buying of cosmetics and xp boosts for short periods. NOT ANY GEAR etc. - Mounts are just flat out AWESOME - Taming basic creatures is simple while more exotic mounts require certain skills/items etc.  - MOUNTS HAVE A VARIETY OF SKINS and provide certain buffs to said mount. Can interchange between skins. - Mounts can be turned into familiars - Familiars aid in combat - Mounts/Familiars can be turned into soulstones (i think thats what they are called, off the top of my head) and can be infused in wepons for bonuses. - Bonus XP for playing in a group - Guilds have levels and give rewards to all members once leveled higher.  AND much much more when I dive deeper into this game.  Cons: - Some visual bugs at times that require re-logging - Some framerate issues from time to time in detailed areas (especially with lower end PCs)  - Gold spammers (early launch, gonna happen) - Cannot report people that are in 'safety' zones, typically where the gold spammers stand, slightly annoying. - Typical MMO grind (But that's what we're lookig for in an MMO, it's all about the grind) - Questing can be stale (kill this gather that) but hey some don't mind. - One weird bug that crashes your game if you try switching region.. (fails to authenticate issue for some reason) - Other basic MMO complaints go here.....  Final input:  If you're on the fence about playing this game / and or buying it. Just do it. I was debating for weeks about whether or not i wanted to pay the 25$ for the early head start and I don't regret it one bit. And if you don't have the money, wait till it opens for free. It's deffinately worth a look and investing time into.  8/10 easily.",

            "review_text": "This is a game with a lot of promise. I see a lot of similarities of Dragon's Prophet which is nice since DP took down their American servers. The map is big but not unfathomably huge (In DP it took me two weeks to get out of the first area, big maps aren't always the best) and you can tame pretty much ANY creature. It's kinda like Pokemon with swords and sweet looking combos. I mean, who doesn't love playing 'keep up' with a baddie instead of a ball or balloon. As far as MMOs go, and I've played my fair share, this one is pretty sweet and I'll definetly come back to it. The style of play is, again, probably influenced by DP or a similar game but it does give you an option to just button mash the keyboard instead of full on mouse control. (something forced in DP but was fun to use when you got the hang of it) I only played two hours but I got to ride a pegasus and a unicorn and a wolf. I could have ridden a boar too but I was getting tired of streaming and wanted to cut it for the night. Also, for you audiophiles, the voice acting is pretty great, but as for the story, well, maybe the plot thickens later. I'll see tomorrow.   But hey, you had me at 'you get to ride a dragon'. Two thumbs and a unicorn horn up.",

If you have only spent 5 hours in an RPG thats beta, kind of silly to write a review.  I will fully admit at first glance/run through it will feel like another knock off MMORPG from the east. Stick with it, its totally worth it. The longer the play you more you realize that even in open beta with limited items/levels/mounts/instances the complexity and depth of the game is really quite impressive.  To give you an example, the instance gear that drops has random stats so you can mix/match for different play styles for each class and each beast you tame can be turned into a bonus for armor so item customization even in the early stages is pretty deep.   The combat is still a little rough but the mixture of tab target and direct LOS target works well for each respective class. Once animations and combos get a little more love I can see it really being a fun combat style.  The game is pretty. It really is, and the cinematics are very well done with an above average story if it is all-be it short at the moment.  If you and your friends have gotten tired of wow or other larger MMOS definitely give it a shot, around levels 15-25 your can sit and instance spam the 4 available almost non stop for some pretty fun times together. As more content gets added and the level cap rises this game has a lot of potential to be a lasting quality addition to the MMORPG market.",

Top mounts become a who catches them first then have to wait 2 hrs to get another try . 90 % of game time will probably be waiting to try and catch a mount...... . Offers limited to a few end dungeons, No PVP,Guild battles of any importance(yes can duel other players is about the limit of it) . No Guild bank,Guild store as of yet . Yes i do enjoy playing just its a constant hitting of a brickwall with staggered release of what is already a full game in Korea they just translated it and slowly releasing it making money of us all .",

The pots are health, mana, stamina, ETC. Gameplay wise the game is pretty good, action combat style takes a little getting used to but is fine once it's learned but there arent any big problems as to why it's not a good game, it's really all minor stuff. You will encounter alot of glitches the game is still in beta. You will crash when loading sometimes, nothing will spawn in instances sometimes, the game will dissconnect you, ETC. All minor problems to be expected from a MMO in beta. If you can get past some annoying minor glitches that will be fixed on release this game is the F2P MMO we were all looking for.",

This review is based to the fact that this game is IN OPEN BETA! Many of the reviews here are written like this is a finished product when it is not. Ok, sure there are some gaps, bugs and problems in the game but this is what BETA stands for. As for the game itself, it is made with CryEngine (making it pretty solid graphically). What sets this game apart is the ability to tame almost every animal/monster you see as you roam in the world. You can even tame flying animals (dragons etc) without spending a single buck. You can PvP in the air with flying creatures. The rest of the animals are just for transportation (i got an ice boar recently, looks pretty cool :D). The rest are standard MMO elements that exist on every MMO. Tweaked here and there a bit to make it seem authentic. The game overall is really fun even now that i am that low of a level. I didn't have any problem so far regarding the game server and connectivity. If the dev keeps working on this he can give birth to a masterpiece. So i will give this game OVERALL 7/10, for a BETA game 9/10.  Tip: If on the first time you get to play the game you get a runtime error (like i did) just do a 'Clean Boot' (there is tutorial for this on microsoft website so just google it). Other than this i had no other problems. Hope this helps.",

            "review_text": "For starters, I do enjoy this game, but that's not to say that there aren't quite a few major issues with it in its current state. Note that this is nowhere near a comprehensive review. This will only cover aspects of the game that stood out to me as a new player with no knowledge of the previous Korean version of this game.   Positive:   I'll start with some aspects of the game that I consider positive. First of all, the game is graphically great for the most part, though there are a few janky textures sprinkled throughout the landscape (especially rock textures.) Speaking of appearance, the aesthetic variety of tamable creatures ensures that most people will be able to find a suitable companion to travel the world with.   Beyond looks, Riders of Icarus has more going for it. The one I found most important is the flexible group size for dungeons. It's possible to play each normal dungeon in solo, duo, or full 5-man mode. For people like me who generally don't enjoy the usual toxic garbage tied to playing with strangers online, it's nice to be able to experience nearly all of the content alone or with a friend or two.  The crafting system for this game is much less grindy than in any other MMORPG I've had experience with. For example, you only need to 'master' two recipes in order to advance to the next tier. Mastering a recipe generally involves crafting about 5-10 of the same item which doesn't take much time at all really. Note that this may change once more of the game is released, as only the first two tiers of crafting are presently available.  Negative:   As is the case with many MMORPGs, its tutorial shows a level of action and engaged story that immediately evaporates as the final introductory cutscene brings you into the meat of the game. From there, players will be dropped off in a very traditional MMORPG experience with fetch/'kill 5 boars' quests. The ability to tame most monsters in the game becomes available fairly early on, but it's immediately clear that the process is dependent on a combination of your character level vs the level of the target creature along with an RNG mechanic.  Another grip I have with this game is in the way combat works. When I say that every single class is a clunky mess, I mean EVERY SINGLE CLASS is a clunky mess. You would think that a combat system based on chaining your skills together would have a very fluid transition between attacks, but for some reason this isn't the case. This issue becomes crystal clear when playing as an assassin who is required to constantly move and dodge in order to survive, but the vast majority of your skills causes you to be rooted to the ground for the duration of the combo, leading to a very quick and frustrating death. All in all, the combat in this game needs quite a bit of work.  Despite the problems in this game, I still think it's pretty solid for a beta and would recommend that anyone interested in MMORPGs try it out for a day or two.",

            "review_text": "Interesting class play styles, each one is different. Caster dps is straight damage as fast as possible, rogue dps is comboing while maneuvering all over the place to avoid damage, tank is what you would call a tank, pull everything to me and stun/interupt them. I've only played the 3, theres also a healer and Heavy melee(berserker).  Mounts are a fun completionist thing, There are a number of cool looking ones and def ones that beat out other in such and such a way. They also have other fuctions such as augmenting gear or using as a pet to help fight. Mounted combat is alright, nothing too special but not boring and useless either.  The problems with the game include the typical NEXON grab for cash though they do give you the store currency quite often through events and dailies. Another would be a number of bugs or unfinished programming issues that should have been addressed in beta such as slow loading(i boot wow and many top end games in about 1/5th the time this one takes to load), easily disconnected when transitioning areas, limited interface options such as darkening the box behind the chat so i can read it, or adding a black list to ignore gold sellers. The game still seems like a beta thing as there is so much of the world to explore but alot of nothing in it. Various NPCs that say they are a store but you can't even chat with them, Crafting not completed and only useful for turning mats into gold through vendors.  You can triumphantly craft something, which for the materials to make other things increases the number made, is good but anything outside armor and weapons does nothing to the item, and the improved versions that you can make arn't worth anything more.  The storyline is a bit weak but lvling isn't too bad. If you follow the main quest line and subsequent quests that pop up around it you should lvl up at a steady rate, no real grinding involved.",

The game already gives you a nice variety of mounts to tame, so if you like collecting Pokemon, you're in for a treat. Also the game is currently limited to lvl 25 while the map shows a huge region yet to be released, also there are talents for lvl 50 characters. I have currently spent 29 hours in the game leveling one character to lvl 25, if you want to level all 4 classes, you can surely get 100 hours of gameplay in this.  There are only a few bugs in the game, which probably every MMORPG has.  The game is completely free to play, it's not pay to win as there is nothing you can buy that will make you any better. The only things you can buy is more inventory space, more mount slots, boosts to increase luck and cosmetics. BUT!!! You pay 5 euro for 80 Ellun which is the currency of the cash shop while you can get 5-10 Ellun every day from simple achievements. You will have about 100 Ellun once you reach lvl 25.  At some places it may be overcrowded but every server had 5 channels which you can switch between in seconds. The dungeons are definitely replayable, offering multiple difficulties, changing armor type and loot chances.   Some cons: There is currently only one raid as the game is not fully released. Guardians are said to be a little underpowered even tho they are a must have in heroic dungeons. There is no dungeon queue system, you can form a party and list it, then people can apply for it. Gold sellers found their way into the game since day one. The auctioneering ain't exactly user friendly. Crafting isn't interesting.",

The ability to choose between action mode and standard mode, Action mode is the more action packed combat we are seeing in most MMO's today and Standard mode is the more classical and a bit more like WOW or something along the line of WOW.  The combat is very fluent and you feel in control.  The ability to earn premium currency by completing achivements.  NEUTRAL:  Lack of combos for other classes other then Assassin  Normal MMO quests, go here, gather this, kill this, talk to this and so forth  The story is just there (if you're looking for a gripping story this will disappoint you)  CONS:  Hitboxes, even if you dodge a attack and your standing 20 ft away your still going to get hit.  Lack of open world map, In a world where you can tame dragons and other flying and/or land beasts you whould thing that the world whould be open world instead of in segments.  Gold spamming, People are trying to sell gold in the chat and i mean spamming, i can barely see anything else but spam.  CONCLUSION:  Do I recommend this game? Yes. Do I think most of the problems could get fixed? Yes, but probably not before the official release,",

And I must say, the one cool feature of this game is that you can pretty much TAME any animal you see in the game and ride them as your mount. Whether it be for flying or ground, thats cool. Granted. You have limited space, untill you need to dig into your pockets and buy NX points to purchase further space. Its best just to save those spots for the 'rare' or above 2 stars animals that you come across. Its cool. Now as for the mechanics of the game, the combat is similar to TERA. You can change combat styles, so if your one that likes the WoW type of combat, single target spam 1-9, you can do that, or you can go TERA style. You can choose, its nice, Graphics are decent, reminds me of Neverwinter graphics, just abit improved for 2016. There are a few bugs here and there but the game has only been out for a day or so. Lag wise, I haven't noticed any, There are no game breaking bugs, no disconnects that i've noticed, I just got to the main city ( I think) and it looks pretty.   There is also mounted combat, so you can get mounts, flying or grounded that offer you the ability to do combat and use your abilities. Thats also a cool way to change up the fighting mechanics of your typical MMO. I would recommend it. At the moment there are only a hand ful of classes, which I assume they will add more, further into development and patches atm there are only.  Beserker class (warrior) Guardian (tank, shield + 1h wep) Assassin (Rogue) Priest (Healer) Sorcerer (mage)  I give it a 3.5 / 5 atm considering there are a few glitches here and there but after all these are sorted and there are more classes and the level cap gets raised from 25 to 40 in an upcoming patch, it will most likely be a 4 / 5 star game.  also there is Microtransations, but its mostly cosmetics, chests that can give you a chance of a nice skin for a familiar (your mount) but it can vary so you may or may not have that mount yet. Your Pet levels also everytime you ride it so you can buy EXP boosts for it, Taming a mount is RNG but 90% to your favor, only had a few times they failed, but you can buy pots at the shop that increase the chances by 10%, not really worth it as you can try as many times to tame that pet, unless its a special mount, like a chieftian (boss/elite) is riding it, so you can make him dismount it and steal it from him. Or a spider that requires a tome that you can only get from High Shamans in a location so you must farm it, as its uncommon you might be there for a long time or a few minutes, even then you can fail to tame that spider and require to farm that tome again.   Performance is good, there are a few FPS drops here and there but nothing to severe. Running everything maxed out, wish I could run it at 2k but game only supports 1080p atm for some reason. You may look at my set up on my profile. Thanks!",

Still mentioning the assassin, should be fixed by now, I tend to die more on my level 23 assassin than my level 18 friend I'm fighting with. Potions do not help. (Note: a familiar is something you can tame)  Pros -Spam emotes to your friends -Ride just about anything you want -Start with a unicorn -Decent flying mechanics -Unique combat moves -Priest is a very great class to play as and was very well made -Pretty good mounted combat -You can be half the size of people which is hilarious -Characters can look really stupid and funny -Really awesome familiars later in the game -Can fly extremely high -Generous game with barely anything to spend your money on although I totally would and will -Useful easy to navigate player market -Being able to treat this game like Pokemon and 'catch' all the familiars -Multiple channels so it's not too lonely or too crowded -Good crafting -Collecting materials isn't hard or even boring -Always have the time and places to mess around in -More pros I couldn't think of -Cons aren't very bad and don't really change the gameplay (not including assassin gameplay)  Cons -You have to wait a bit to do mounted combat -Region chat is constantly being spammed by websites that want to sell lots of in game currency for an extremely cheap price -People don't help each other enough... come on people, give a helping hand -Most priests (not me :3) will sit there and watch you die as you beg for them to heal you -Assassins have such terrible health that they can't do enough damage to make up for it (seriously, a level 23 assassin will have 2k, a level 18 guardian will have 3k, that's a bit sad) -Stocking up on potions does not work because there's a long cooldown so hush potion stockers -Most attacks cannot be evaded no matter what you do (once again, trashing assassins) -Can't make many characters (not sure about other servers but I could make 3 characters, someone else could make 2 characters, so Idek) -Definitely the armor, the armor is a problem for the girls, I've gotten stuck with literally a metal bra and shorts multiple times but this is an mmorpg and they always do that for no reason no idea why -Pets could use a little fixing if you tell them to attack when you're already in combat they'll just continue to follow instead",

You can obtain some of the more interesting mounts after grinfing away to about level 17 or so. The game encorages playing with friends (desite not having PVP yet) and doing the sidequests.  However just because its free, doesn't mean its suddenly perfect:  Quests consist of the typical boring objectives (kill the monster(s) and repeat)  In terms of monster spawns, the world seems crowded and just silly as the monsters are all thrown into an area. Some people may prefer this because its easier to farm the spawns.  Enemies are pretty one dimesional when it comes to combat.  There needs to be more different types of skills implimented into the game in my opinion (I kinda wanted a skill tree if anything).   Controls can be a bit hard to get a grasp of.  There aren't enough dungeons in the game (hopefully they add more).  Don't be put off by any of the points I've made though. This game still has the potential to be a great game and we are yet to see the PVP gameplay (as of 01/08/16), plus many more updates to come. Overall its a solid game.",

NOTE: i've just installed it on steam for ♥♥♥♥♥ n giggles but I have played this longer than my steam account says  CONS: -framerate, it is just messed up when there are more than 10 players for me on the EU servers (gtx980 and I7 yea boi) -Combat, The action combat targeting can just kiss my ♥♥♥. -Hp drop with enemy's animation. Yep, I see my HP bar gradually lowering as time goes by but it doesn't quite match with what the *insert mob name* does or whatsoever -Lip sync, It just looks a tad out of place -Characters in animations who have no general goal in this sequence are just standing there in a T shape. -Left mouse click is a bit bugged and the attack (assassin again) feels rather slow -Mount stamina, Need I explain? -Besides mounts you can tame and use in combat, it's nothing special or anything. -UI functionality can be improved -Mob spawns (killed a little train of 5 mobs I made and saw another 3 spawning and killing me right after...) -Not completely open world which stops me from being really dragged into the world.  PROS: -Character creation, I've seen worse and this gives you a wide variation of things you can choose, too bad about the lack of sliders. -The sound effects are good enough to be 'immersed' or whatever kids say these days. -F2P -Decent mounted combat both on ground and in air. -Tab targeting actually is interesting for once due to mobility and combos -Leveling does require some amount of ''skill''. (define skill) -Lots of mounts and pets you can collect. -Graphics are MMO-wise very good.  ANOTHER NOTE: As of now there are some boosts you can buy in the cash shop so it CAN be considered P2W by some nitpicky sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es but personally I think it does certainly give the player a little boost, it can't be considered really P2W as it doesn't directly give you more power than the non paying person. This can be changed however so i'll just wait and see how Nexon deals with this game.   Overall it's an okay game and if you find the time i'd recommend you to simply try it out. But also know that there are a lot of other games out there that do CERTAIN aspects better, such as: B&amp;S, GW2, Tera, Vindictus (Rip if you're from EU), wildstar and Bless Online (if you can overlook the horrid combat system which I actually doubt for the hardcore mmo gigolo's)",

Really hope they fix the fps lag soon, causes me to die and I get super angry with it, but minus that, I love this game; You can have an awesome PC but still have this randoml fps lag, the game is so smooth sometimes but once I am in battle or sometimes sprinting with my mount, I just get bad fps. Everything is free with the option to buy, of course. Timers are quite fair i'd say, and the taming points are just right. Beginning game you'd feel like you would need more familiar slots and taming points but trust me, once you're at leve 15 + and have tamed what you desire you'll have to start farming (yay) for items to tame bigger and better creatures as your familiar(s). If you're going after the golden claw/golden saddle/ laiku etc, i'd suggest using your taming points up before lvling on common creatures before you keep leveling till you reach 15 so you have more of a breath of fresh air and only have the harder familiars to tame left to deal with. But seriously, no biggy either way. Taming points get reset every day either way, and upon leveling, but I made sure to go on taming frenzy's for common critters before mine did get reset. Now i'm just stuck with farming for stuff.   That was a long summary, but summed it up with taming I hope. Seriously though, this game is great! But if you hate lag, you're going to want to wait till they optimize it a little bit cus it is flippen annoying. Not sure if it's just me, but doesn't make sense I cannot run it on good settings, let alone on low settings.   Devs please fix that. you guys are doing great, thank you. &lt;3",

The combat is near perfect, some of the funnest and most engaging i'v ever played. It utilizes controls in a way that while being modern, is still innovative and action packed, and for once, GLORIOSLY FLUID, even the camera was on point and for an action mmo thats a rarity.   While many if not most mmo's with this type of action Mouse-camera combat is clunky and pvp often gets confusing and more diffacult to manage, not so with this game, it combines classic Follow-tab mechanics without holding your hand, with the ability to dodge move and attack and circle your oppents, pvp is gloriosly fun while with most this style of combat tends to feel like i'm fighting the opponent and the camera. Not so with this game the camera while not perfect; is damn near infallable,  Combat is quick weighty and split seconds can spell your victory or defeat, A priest can kill an assassin if their clever, and vise vera without feeling like you've lost the entire battle cause one spell stunned you and decimated SO far i love this game, time will tell if that changes.

Audio is great. The music is enjoyable and fits with the different areas of the world very well. Voice acting is surprisingly good considering it's a Korean mmo. They definitely put some effort in here. Translations were done very well too.  The cash shop is a mixed bag. So there's not really any pay 2 win things in the cash shop. There's convenience items like bags, character appearance changes, etc, all the stuff you'd expect. Bags are a little pricey though and they're not easy to get in-game. It's clear that bags are one area they really wanted to make their money from. But they do make it fairly easy to earn the cash shop currency. Before you're level 10 you'll have earned at least 50 (one bags worth) just from achievements. You can earn a good amount from dailies and repeatable quests as well.  All in all, it's a great MMORPG.

WHY?   1. the legendary dungeon drop rate is sh!ttty! i did almost 20 run with the guild not a single magic essence (used to craft lvl 40 gear karasha) some did more than me and got nothing but frustration.  - we cry in the forum to increase the godamn drop rate, difficulty is fine (for my guild atleast). guess what the dev did they nerf the legendary dungeon and gave every single players a 20% drop chance -_- that did not help at all.  so right now its almost impossible to craft level 40 gear.   i already spent $40 in this game because i want to support this game. i hope the next expansion level cap increase theyll do everything right. i know u can't please everybody but atleast listen to the majority. and stop selling mount that is tamable on higher level. seriously we have a source of info from europe server. they already lvel 60.",

Here are the biggest pros and cons as far as I'm concerned:  Pros: Fairly immersive gameplay Engaging story Tame the mount that suits you Dragons! :) (lots of them) Good game mechanics Some really great and helpful players  Cons: The game still has some kinks to work out. One of the biggest is trying to attack or collect across the edge of a 'chunk' of the world. It can tell you it's 'Out of Range' when you're standing right on top of it, and you'll need to change your angle a bit to make it work. The amount of gold buyers has really exploded the game economy - it can be a little tricky to keep up on the AH or in-game trading if you don't buy gold (which may or may not be against the ToS). Doesn't impact actual gameplay that much. Like any other MMO, many of the players can be a bit elitist and snobbish at times. Don't hold that against the game though.   So overall I am happy to recommend this game. If you like MMOs, mounted combat, picking your mount from a wide variety of creatures, and an action-based combat system, this game is for you.",

Being able to tame everything you see, including rare mobs is a really cool mechanic. I wouldn't say that's why you should play this instead of anything else. but it's cool non-the-less.  CASHSHOP Oh boy, yes I was woried just like most people that Nexon would be Nexon, but no! The cash shop looks really fair. After a couple of hours of play I've earned over 60 Ellun (worth about 7$) through just playing. Allowing me to buy a quick 16 slot bag. (Costumes only cost 50 Ellun as well, which means that you could buy yourself a cool costume really quick as well!).  RELEASE SCHEDULE Right now the max level is 25 which is on the low side, after 6 hours I'm level 15 (with definite signs of slowing down, but still), With an upcoming content release in July that increases the level cap to level 35. So they are defintely going hard on their content plan. But I don't know at this point in time if there is enough content to keep people playing at level 25. If there isn't, then that's a serious problem obviously.  --- That's my review in progress for the 6 hour mark, current verdict: Really solid fun ---  ---  From streaming this game for the past 6 hours I've noticed several people having technical problems, not being able to launch the game. For people having issues I advice the follow:  - Restart the game several times (It took me 5 starts before it no longer crashed.exe - Restart your PC - Turn off your Anti-Virus (AVG specifically has been reported as culprit) - Turn off your firewall/make an exception - Make sure you're running Steam in admin mode - Try the regular client (not steam)",

            "review_text": "This is my first game review on steam, hopefully ill do the game and review justice. First i will say, Riders of Icarus reminds me of a Hybrid between Skyforge and World of Warcraft as far as the gameplay/graphics/simplicity (Skyforge), and the questing and beast taming (WoW). Ive seen some comparisons to Pokemon, but ive never played any of those games. Im a old fart, 40+ yrs old and didnt grow up on pokemon..  Like Skyforge, RoI has really sharp details and graphics in my opinion. Environments are nice and well done, the Capitol City is well done also. Playing on Full Graphic settings, im pulling in around 50-60 FPS with no real issues to speak. Gameplay is a nice change of pace here also. The game will give you two option to play from. Your standard MMO setting, of tabbing to your target, pressing hotkeys etc, and a Action setting (again think Skyforge), where you will have to keep your reticle on your target as you fight. The game recommends Action setting for the Melee characters (Assassin, Guardarian, Beserker) and normal setting for Casters (Priest, Wizard, maybe another class i may be forgetting lol). I have played with an Assassin, and Priest so far and i would agree with RoI on the gameplay settings as well. Last comparison ill draw to Skyforge is the simplicity of the game. I for one don't mind it, and is a plus for me. Some characters are harder to play then others ie Assassin vs Priest. My Assassin is currently lvl 21, and i've died many, many times versus my Priest who is currently lvl 18, and i've died twice. It could be that i just suck (perhaps) as an Assassin, or casters are just easier to play. Regardless, its nothing to get wrapped up about, as overall, i think the game will not be difficult for anyone to play. At least at this stage and levels of the game.  Questing is like World of Warcraft, or pretty much any typical MMO out there these days. Talk to NPC, kill X amount of creatures, gather X amount of ___, Tame this creature, etc etc. There is alot of running around and just talking to NPCs, particullary the quests in the Capitol. Speaking of taming, like in WoW, you are able to tame creatures and make them your Mounts and Pets. Unlike WoW though, any class can do it. Also, majority of the creatures in the game are tameable. They range from Flying mounts (birds, dragons) to the standard ground mounts (panthers, unicorns, turtles etc etc too many to list). When you first tame a creature, it will become a mount for you. You will also have a option to make the creature into a Pet that will aid you in combat with the use of a pet scroll. There is a limited amount of slots however for the number of pets/mounts you can have, without purchasing additional slots ~  Pros:  1. Gameplay and Combat. I personally love it, and having the option to use standard controls or action is a plus. Also, this game has Aerial Combat! You can kill stuff while flying around on your mounts with a crossbow or spear  2. Graphics. Very Detailed, nice graphics that i can run at full settings even on my 2012 purchased Alienware Aurora Desktop PC (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3820 CPU @ 3.60GHz, AMD Radeon HD 7800 Series, 16 gig ram . 50-60 FPS thru out.  3. Free to play ~ Not a pay to win game (yet anyways). I haven't seen any reason to have to purchase ANYTHING with real money, that you can't achieve just by playing the game. Of course, this game was just released, and that could possibly change down the road.   4. Taming. +++ Tame damn near any creature ya want, use em as mounts or pets!  5. Crafting system. Simple. I hate complex crafting systems. (Alchemy, Cookings, Jewelcrafting, Armor, Weapons, Barder). Your not limited here, You can craft all of em, you dont have to pick and choose which type of crafter you want to be.  Neutral:  1. No option to 'que' up for Dungeon Instances. There is a LFG Party Channel, but its just not as good as what ive come use to in other games.    Cons:  1. No PvP (yet). This is probably a neutral for me, as im not big into PvP aspects, but as it stands currently, i don't believe there is any type of PvP outside of duels in the game. I did hear that it was something that will be added, but that was just hearsay.  2. Spam Gold bots! Good grief, they are everywhere. This latest patch is supposed to be adding more 'channels', and you can block them, however, there are so many of em that you will be spending time adding them all, and ya are limited i believe on how many ppl you can add to your block list.   3. Content. As it stands, lvl 25 is the max. It doesnt take that long to reach 25, maybe a week of playing. I have a lvl 21, and lvl 18, with my hours played so far. Also, questing drys up around near that level as well outside of the dailies. Again, supposedly end of July there will be a cap level increase to 35.  So there ya have it. Overall, i am really enjoying this game, and definately recommend it as a game to try out. You have nothing to lose.   Here are a couple links to YT videos of some gameplay with my assassin to give you a idea how the game looks and plays etc:          YouTube™ Video:  Bearsfan217 - Free MMORPG Riders of Icarus - Level 16 Assassin - Game play w/ commentary&nbsp;",

Is this a P2W - Definately NO! The market only carries a few potions that quite honestly I can get as drops from mobs and costume crap that I can live without. Though the best part of the market- you can purchase Premium Service that will give exp bonus, daily replenishment blah blah, summon storage and auction npcs.   I would recommend this game if you are a mount collector or a pet collector. Though you will have to buy more slots to house LOTS of animals as you only get a few slots. There is an award system in place for those who love to collect. Otherwise its a great time killer until: (A) they put in more patches and expand the cap for crafting and leveling or (B) the game you have been waiting on is released. Afterall it is F2P.",

The game does have some annoying bugs that I've run into but nothing to infuriating. This is definitely a game where you want to get a party of your friends together though. Playing alone as some classes is either difficult or just plain boring. It's manageable but at the cost of some enjoyment. Like all MMOs, at the start it feels awkward to control but after some time it gets better. The sensitivity settings are really my main complaint. On max I could still only turn a small amount dragging my mouse all the way across my mouse pad. In conclusion, this cake has alot going for it, it just needs a little more time in the oven",

A game that had some potential to waste some time and enjoy yourself gutted like a fish by Nexon, a publisher not a developer. It shows, and I just hope the next project they pay money to aquire they do what they should do; host.   -Itemization is plain. A few rarities with such a limited stat pool that it can't even be called randomized.  -Talent system is the standard fluff system. You have 8 slots by the time you hit max level, with three trees that have 6 'buffs' in each. These are all passives, with no actives aquired. They also give a stat boost for using more than one from the same tree, leading to a huge stat break when using 5 of 6 from any given tree. Replicas, with no real decision but a few % here or there leading up to relatively the same end result.   -Familiars are buff bot rotations. There is no great connection on any level between the familiars you have. Species does not matter, just rarity. This includes pets you bring into combat, and the ones you ride on.   -ALL side activites in the NA/EU Nexon published Riders of Icarus have been removed until further notice. There is NO PVP, cept for duels. There is NO fishing, as even the npc were removed from the place ALL other versions introduces you to the fun activity. ALL special coins were removed save for one whose rewards have been butchered to uselessness. Even the first chance to actually breed/grow/work with familiars has been removed by Nexon for whatever reason they want to give, but there is no reason activies everyone could enjoy needed axed.   -They revamped the difficulty and pushed the game from being a prepare and farm to a pot chugging fest. Removed are talismans. Removed from costumes that also were obtained from special coins and cash shop any and all stats. Very few items/gear that give buffs remain, but the game has increased monster HP by many factors to push,,,,  -Premium Sub! Yep. Among so many things, Premium sub is shoved down your throats. Daily allotment of 100% hp and 100% familiar stamina pots. Did I forget to mention that they made familiars you mount or use in battle use up their stamina at an insane rate? Oh, there was indeed a reason.  -They have taken out everything fun in the game in order to make the one thing the game tries to stand out on, familiars, such a pain to maintain that you will need to spend elune just to use them.   -The game is optimized so badly, and worse than other versions! 4670k 4.4ghz, 1080gtx and there are stagnant pinpoints where fps drops down to 25fps. There is one pet and one point in the biggest city that does this, but overall the engine is a cpu hog that pushes my cpu temps above what Doom on Ultra can. The game isn't gpu bound, but cpu bound that could actually cause you problems outside of games if heat is a issue when normally it is not for those who just game but don't actively monitor. They even removed the 64bit client, and only allow 32bit, to make it look like they tried to fix it. That was 'never' the issue, and they are unable to fix it.    The game in Korea might rock! Who knows, but the version in the US and EU is an average setting with bland flavoring cut down too many times for too high a price.",

            "review_text": "Let me get this out of the way: This isn't a very good MMORPG.  The most glaring fault is obviously that they've capped the player progress far too early compared to the Asian versions of this game. Nexon's version basically ends where the other versions - and most other MMOs would be starting. This is a temporary issue, certainly, but for now it's a critical one.  Furthermore, the game feels incredibly dated. From the basic graphics to missing QOL features. Dungeon finder? Nope, not back here in 1998!  The gameplay  tries , very half-heartedly, to mix things up by introducing an alternative control method, but it's far from an actual action MMO. This isn't TERA, Blade &amp; Soul, Guild Wars or 9th Continent. It's just tab-target combat using your mouse instead of the tab-button.  I also can only really speak about the PvE side of things because there literally is no PvP in here yet except for 1v1 duels on the street. So is the PvE content good then? No. It's not. You have the genre-typical quests and a handful of  very  short and easy dungeons. There's a classic trinity class-system but it's completely ignored for the group content. The 'tank' in this game is just an aggro initiator, and the role can be performed by anyone - even the wizard glass cannon. Every encounter just devolves into 'run in, gather whatever aggros and nuke it to pieces within 2 seconds'. There's something to be said for having the player feel powerful but this is going overboard. Nothing feels dangerous and there's nothing at stake so it's impossible to care.  The single raidboss encounter is no exception to this lack of interest, but at least he doesn't die fast. In fact, just the opposite. To access the fight you have to tame a series of mounts that are able to climb to increasingly high altitudes. That's fine and dandy but once inside you're faced with one of the worst bosses I've seen in an MMO. Confined to your flying mounts and the weapons that accompany them, your group will be engaging in a fight that is so drawn out that I went and took breaks several times throughout the fight - to no ill effect, I must add. The encounter is purely a test of patience as you whittle down his bodyparts, with the biggest 'challenge' being if everyone in the group brought enough stamina potions for their mounts to keep flying.  Catching monsters and turning them into pets or mounts is the most interesting aspect of the whole game, and if you have a bit of a Pokémon-mentality about it I'm sure you can get some fun out of that. Once you have a set of monsters you like though (you really just need 3 good ones; a ground mount, a flying mount and a pet that compliments your class with it's passive and/or attacks) you can pretty much ignore this whole part of the game as well.  Right now, the best thing I can say about the game is that gear drops in abundance inside the dungeons. You get a ton of it each run, so it's fast and easy to get your character set so you can move on - most likely to another game since this doesn't have anything else to do afterwards.",

I made a review at the start which was positive but i deleted it and now giving negative point.   I started this game with big hopes but where this game become now is well, they are in a wrong road. I don't like writing huge paragraphs so i want to give pros and cons, you cna understand why i give negative review.  Pros: +Lots of mounts you can use, dragons included. +Character creation +Pets +Crafting system +Taming +Graphics (meh...)  Cons: -No advantage in premium, you wait for them to update the game. In this time non premium users catch you easily. -Potions given with premium doesn't stack. Whether you use your potions or not you will get max 20 heal and stamina potions. Your premium time decreases while in updates too. You can't enter the game but your premium time decreasing. False marketing cheating players... -Boring and unbalanced dungeons and bosses. Mostly you can solo dungeons. -Game has no main goal. You try to get best equipments but there is nothing to do after. -PM made this game totaly taming game or lets say this game becomes a farming game. There are lots of mounts to tame but there is no need to tame them because there is nothing to do with all those mounts. You need one ground and one flying mount to complate the game. PM know this critical problem so they started marketing based on taming. Now all players try to catch heroic mounts but as i said there is no advantage between a heroic mount and standart mount because there is nothing to do after. -Some says this game is not p2w but they are totaly wrong. This game is p2w now and will become more p2w. You need ellun to temper your items. You need ellun to increase your inventory space, mount space, bank space, auction house space. You need ellun to revive after death at the same spot without any debuff. If you don't have ellun you will revive from the dungeon start with a 10 minute debuff which effects lots of your stats. If you die again this debuff stacks and well you can not do anything other than wait which is not good for your group. You need scroll which is becoming expensive in long run. ALSO you need to buy premium. Yes i know i said they are cheating you premium but anyway PM made premium that you need it. If you play without premium you will miss many things and you can't level eassily or finish dungeons. -There are lots of gold sellers, advertising givers, bots andd cheaters. You can't right click on a player name to report him and make him quiet. Well enjoy :) -5 class enter a dungeon but only two class can get something. All players in the group giving same time and effort but only two of them gets some equipmöent. Other three is just looking. Well do you play a game that has no justice? I won't! -Lets say you are one of the lucky two. You are happy to get an equipment. You look its stats after you exit from the dungeon with curiosity and happiness. You are berserker and you see wizard stats on your equipment. You are in a shock. Well you will see this lots of times in this game.  -Action mod is totaly buggy and doesn't work. It doesn't target enemies automaticly for example so your skills go to air.  I can write more cons here but i am tired.  CONCLUSİon: Don't start to play this game!",

I give the game props for implementing a pretty good mount system, but it seems the developers focus all their time fine-tuning that system over other aspects of the game.  • Tab-targetting &amp; action combat - Gives both options, but movement is clunky and robotic. • Mounted pet system - Can tame just about every monster in game. • Traditional questing - Nothing new here • Standard fantasy theme, no other playable races except humans. • Not a true open world game, maps are instanced base.   A typical filler game for wasting time on, but definitely can’t justify the +10GB download for a game that isn’t quite fleshed out. The lack of content doesn't help either, but if you're into monster hunting and taming, and can get used to the stiff combat then give it a go, otherwise i'd give this a pass.   TL;DR  5/10",

Everything was fine until the Parna Coast content expansion (level 25-35).  a) I didn't like the negative region effects (slower movement until you get a cold region mount) b) the monsters seemed much harder to kill than they should be in the new region from the start considering I had the highest level gear possible from the previous dungeon c) the elite familiars ALL need a token to tame, which is not true in previous regions.  Still somewhat fun, but the last dungeon and taming heroic monsters killed it for me. I'm uninstalling.   a) The last dungeon, the Frost Keep- Not super hard on Elite, except the bossess... tanks were being one shotted by the main boss. Once a party member goes down, really hard to revive without everyone else dying. Boss kills 3 people in one shot with one skill. The drops are terrible, yet as a healer, I spend 25 ellun reviving? Screw that. I don't mind a difficult dungeon, but this is nearly impossible without getting this dungeon's gear FIRST. That's not happening with the way the auction prices are, and if you have to do that, what's the point? A really good party can do it, but if you're queing randoms, you don't know until it's too late.   b) Taming a heroic mount- 8 people shooting the hell out of the mount Apocalypse to get it to 30% for 20+ minutes. then someone renegs on an agreement we all made over who would get to try first and jumps on it out of order and gets it.

Trying to tame all the mounts? Good luck, it's amazing how hard it is just to get the heroic taming marks. During the facebook taming buff, my friend and I both have two of the tamming marks for Agnas the Red. Both times, my friend failed, causing him to quit the game, and soon I followed.   The auction house is full of people that try to make 200 gold for items that aren't worth nearly as much as they should be selling for. The spammers was a huge problem, causing me to only be on Party chat for the longest time. And if you want to get a heroic mount, good luck, cause it's almost impossible to fight 5 other people for the same mount. Some people just wait till the bosses health is lowered, no help at all to lowering the heroic mount.   Assassin in my opinion, was really hard to play as. There really should be less instances where you are playing alone, it makes it really hard to play when you are used to playing with friends. However, due to that, you tend to treasure the party instances when it comes to it.   Priest was a fun class to play as, and it made the game much easier. In all honesty, it probably mostly has to do with my play style. Priests are needed a lot, so parties without a priests tend to struggle, so thorough planning will have to be done.   Taming was fun for a while. It was always very rewarding to tame something for me, though I wish that you didn't have to use special currency to buy more spots, if you want to keep certain mounts. For a while, taming was a lot of fun! That was, until they upped the difficulty of taming. It made it really hard to tame even common monsters, which caused even more rage from my friend and I.  I have a feeling that this game will be going down a pay to win route. I seriously hope it doesn't, as it could be an amazing game if not. Of course, no one wants this, and the game will lose a lot of players, and I wont touch the game ever again, in fact, I'll delete it if so. This game can be amazing, and I'm greatfull that the creators listen to the players when they need help with something.   Just a quick thing, I'm not saying don't play the game. In all honesty, you should. It's a lot of fun, and get some of your friends to play it! Just... Be cautious, cause this game is growing harder the more and more updates that come around. There are a lot of things that need to be fixed, but this game is still new, and MMO's are never finished. I look forward to every update, and read everything new they add.... I just hope that they will fix all the problems instead of adding constant new things that may be too hard for anyone to play.   Thank you for reading~",

In four or five hours even, I could feel the in-game currency prices for basic services start spinning-up, to entice players toward the shop. If you want to 'support the game' or whatever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and DO try to use the shop, you find that the cash shop has a reserve currency. I'm not even kidding... You have to convert dollars to nexon points, and then those to the ROI shop currency. You CAN get nxp for five or ten bucks...but with all the conversion, you get less than 50 caps to spend in game. Guess what most ♥♥♥♥ costs in the ROI shop? So you have to spend 2x as much for whatever you're after and carry a balance. Is this a thing we want to encourage in Western markets? The game is fun..ish..as is...but that shop is a giant, flashing 'WE THINK YOU ARE STUPID' sign. If they were going to 'borrow' so much from TERA, they could have taken their shop idea as well.

I first thought it reminded me of Dragons Prophet which I had some great fun in a couple of years ago, I was excited about this game because I was hoping for a somewhat improved Dragons Prophet. This game is not a better version of flying and taming mounts, I think that DP does a better job of making mounts more useful in battle and more interesting. I was also surprised by the lack of flying mounts available. Im assuming this was a great enticement, the flying mounts for others as it was for me, but from the start there are no flying mounts to be seen. The pets that you can tame, foxes, turtles, unicorn, wolves etc-can be ridden (slowly) and turned into companion pets to help fight (poorly). Howver you can only have either a companion pet or a mount, as soon as you call on one, the other disappears.  For me the pets are pretty but useless. In Dragons Prophet the first area you land in has flocks of flying animals you can tame, fight and fly with, all who improve your stats in various ways and help with your crafting too, In this game I didnt get to tame a flying mount until after level 15, although I got a flying mount handed to me earlier than that. Everything is drip fed to you, only 5 speces in the broker, a small bank space, small bags (cash shop item) 11 pet/mount spaces, more can be purchashed with ellun the cash shop currency. A nice feature is that you can earn small amounts of this in game as you earn achievements but not enough to do much with, so if you want a bigger bag space then be content with only 5 broker spaces. Prices are a bit steep or the money you make is a bit low but im sure that can be worked out in the beta. The game play can get very laggy at times and is quite challenging for me but not too bad at this stage. Im 30 hours in and have three characters, one nearly at level twenty. I think the game hasnt grabbed me enough to make me want to spend my time and my own cash which Im happy to do in a game I like, One thing I hate is the runes for armour and weapons are actually made from squashing one of your pets into a rune. Not so nice for animal lovers even if they are only pixels. I did it once and then decided not to do it again.

Other then downloading some outside app that can basically manually invert your mouse there is no way for an inverted user to play this game. Its 2016 I dont know whats up with this issue, the sad part is you notice the forums on the offical page already has posts regarding this.  Anyways I decided to make an account on their forums to ask about this, and for fun named my forum name 'NoInvertedMouse' and guess what, I dont get approved for almost 2 weeks now, and approval to post is still pending.  And so, I go and make an alt account on the forum and guessss what. ready to post approved. The funny part is, is that forum name offensive? maybe to the company.   The end statement is this, any gaming company thats already made shooters with inverted mouse and doesnt seem to care about whats going on in the latest patch for their game that has something as easy providing an inverted mouse option, doesnt deserve your money. Its likely going to follow suit with everyother F2P rpg model and have some kind of money grab built in, they want to come up with enough content to suck up enough dollars and once everyone gets paid they are gonna vacate their player base.

I was really hoping for inovation in this genre to keep my intrest going but, apart from the mount system, its basically the same game as TERRA which just so happens to be F2P. To my dismay the open beta didn't really imerse me into the story (very forgetable). Even the tutorial level and cutscenes still didn't provide much context. As I was leveling up and unlocking new skills, the game never showed me how to put those skills on my hotbar. I know it sounds stupid of me for needing a tutorial to do something as simple as putting skills on a hotbar but when i opened the skill menu to drag and drop them, the skills just activated instead. Because of this i was forced to play with a huge non-transperant window taking up 1/3rd of my screen and messing with my controls in the process. After what I have seen so far, I think the absolute most i would pay for it would be $5 but it really should go F2P. For me Riders of Icarus is a 4/10.",

I recommend this game, but I have so many troubles I do not even know where to start.   I am not new to games and I've played WoW a little, so the basic operations are clear. But this game here is so counter-intuitive I can not even begin to describe...  *) Chat is useless. Everyone spams about gold. I tried right-clicking their names, but nothing shows up. No ignore or anything. Thus I can not communicate with people and ask simple questions. *) Combat system is a little whack. It promises fast pace action, but I do not feel it. The moment you attack you are stuck, so to say, so you can not really attack with a skill and move too. You can't even pull out your sword if you are not 3 meters from the enemy. Then, when the enemy is down, you have to wait a second before you can loot it. This all gives you a feeling of a very, very rigid and cumbersome mechanic. Nothing fluid in the slightest. *) Half the time or more I have no idea what I'm doing. I've tried the ingame help, but no luck. I am lvl 15 and still just stumbling through the game blindly. I do not know if people have stats as such, haven't found them. Skills are just thrown at you as you lvl. And then you have to... combine them? Why can't I level alchemy? The hell is going on? Seriously I have little to no idea. *) I don't know what is a bug and what is my stupidity. I stopped playing just now because I could not get off my dragon.    Now, why I do suggest this game after all this?  *) You can really tame a whole lot of things. It is not like 3 dedicated spots somewhere. Really, almost everything you see can be tamed.  *) The air fights are fresh for me. You can actually kill cows while flying on a dragon and that is always nice.   I will occasionally play this game just for the flying combat. I do not plan on trying to reach competitive skill level here. The fighting mechanics do not seem to be worth it at all.

Collecting animals, level them up, them shrink them for upgrade your armor and do stuff with your tallents. Thats it.

Please, Don't buy it NOW, wait for open f2p beta and see for yourself is it good or not.   At this beta stage im NOT recommending this game for people who use to play WoW, Lineage II, Everwinter, Rift and especially - Terra. The game is not so bad, its more or less ok, but its closed beta and the price to enter in my opinion is simply insanely high. I will check this game one more time at the later stage.

Managing to press the quick-time indicated buttons, will increase your success bar. Sounds easy enough, right? Wrong. While pressing the buttons is stupidly easy since you have almost 2 1/2 years to press them, the interval between two buttons is filled with randomized progress. If you're lucky, the success bar fills, if you're unlucky, the failure bar fills up.  3 steps in the failure bar = you get knocked off the creature 4 steps in the success bar = you manage to tame the creature  it's pure rng and stupidly annoying.  the flying mounts control poorly and are slow. very slow. if you're played WoW, tbc; remember the cheap flying mounts? yeah, that's around the speed you will soar through the heavens in this game.  gliding is the only way to fly faster and for some reason drains more stamina than flapping the wings, and you (obviously) can't control your height while doing that. _____________________________________________  Their approach to open world is equally frustrating. in areas where you're free to go wherever, there is absolutely nothing. a few trees dotted in a vast plain with absolutely nothing to see. maybe one or two animals here and there. thrilling.   combat is ok I guess. not the biggest fan of the fact that you can't deal damage on enemies you haven't tab targeted even though you're swinging into their faces other than that it's ok.   graphics is garbage  don't get me wrong, there's worse. but for a 2016 release title, the graphics really isn't nice. it's not even a pleasent theme. it's just bad. lighting is absolutely horrendous and there aren't actual shadows.   conclusion: 2.5/10  it's boring and no fun at all    ",

When this is the situation, combat mechanics also sucky pepperoni. Assassins do not have stealth, there are combos you can make but it doesn't matter because all game is about 'First Hit Wins'  PvE mechanics has no cure for it's lelelelel mobs.

It could have been something great, but it's clunky combat as well as buggy gameplay leads to a terrible experience. The whole idea of being able to tame/mount almost everything was great until someone kills the thing you're taming and I can't imagine how hard it must be later on with higher end mounts. Having your pets have a stamina bar was in my opinion a bad choice since half the quests I've played so far involve you running backwards and forwards between locations. The graphics are pretty decent but the overal gameplay is disappointing and I doubt it will improve. The unnecessary amount of grinding and the lack of variety in quests with the whole 'Kill this x times', or 'Collect this from x location' really leads to a dulled down experience.  Conclusion: Unique spin on the whole idea of mounts, and graphics are great but uninteresting gameplay with needless grinding (which not even playing with friends can make it more enjoyable). I wouldn't recommend this game unless they make some vast improvements.",

The game now runs great on my computer, which is good, because the game is very beautiful. However, you can polish a turd till it shines, but that doesn't make it good. Though I'm sure some may find this game very appealing, it just doesn't do the same for me. So i'm just gonna make a list of things that I like and dislike about the game, and yall can take it from there. Aight? Aight  First off, the pros. -The game does look very good, provided the system you're using can run on atleast medium graphics -Character creation is very in depth, and you can truly create a unique character to represent yourself in game. I literally spent about 20 minutes on this alone. -The idea of fighting on a mount is actually pretty cool. Lemme know how it is! -For the moment, does not seem like its P2W.  Now, the cons. -I've seen people compare the combat in this game to the likes of Tera. However, in Tera, the game keeps the engaging combat system even on the first levels of the game, with the ability to actively block and dodge attacks, and counter with your own. I have seen none of it in this game. It wants to be an Action MMORPG, but tab targetting makes this very difficult. There are times when I, as a Berserker, feel like some attacks would hit multiple targets in front of me, but they just don't. Though it does happen, it doesn't happen as often as it looks like it should. -Literally, ♥♥♥♥ing bots. This is one of the reasons I stay away from F2P games. Bots should never, EVER be an issue in ANY game. If Runescape, a game that's been around as long as most of our generation, can put the ♥♥♥♥-Smack down on bots, so can this game. There's no excuse for this.  Now i'm not gonna try and drag this out anymore, as I have not seen much of the game at all. This is just a first impression, and does not reflect the entirety of the game. And because it's a FREE game, I can't say to not play it.

All i can say is the time i spent waiting for new content is ridiculous. Game lets you advance to current max lvl in about 3-6 days depending on how much time you have. And when you reach that cap it is not rewarding. You will spend 99% of your time redoing the same dungeons over and over again for supplies. The limit of taming creatures per day is dumb, because you need to tame some creatures that cost 4/100 points say 4 times to create a item to tame another creature for 12/100 points just to tame the legendaries for 40/100 points, and its not even 100% success rate. Losing hundreds of gold and time for an attempt at a legendary that someone can flag up and kill you while u try to tame. Nothing else to do than farm dungeons that also have a daily limit and a 1 hour cooldown before redoing them. Cashshop provides auto looting items and sometimes items that help in the enhancing of gear. Premium currency also helps in boosting gear. It's just an overall mess of a game in this state. Looking at how i spent 640 hours of my time on this game that i completely just deleted was a pretty big waste of my time. Regardless I spend about half of those hours sleep lvling my mounts to turn into marks to put into my gear. It takes an absurd amount of time to lvl a Heroic mount from lvl 1-30.",

Even if players meet the minimum requirement for installing the game or be able to play it, there will be that problem of actually playing the game without waiting for a minute to a hour just for the game to load and disconnect. Waste of time to even reinstall the game itself.",

I restart the game, and it does it again. It is an endless cycle. I was actually looking forward to trying this game out, but if there is this much of a hassle just to start the game, I am afraid to find out how much of a hassle it will require actually play the game.",

Thats the major issue with this game. The grapics are average to above. The dynamics needs a little work too. But, all in all, Its a fun game! I would recommend this game to play but, for now with the really bad connection issues, I would say wait till more servers and stability comes along before you invest any money in this game. Its f2p.   *UPDATE* This game is really unstable... You log in and you start exploring the world and suddenly you notice that no other player or npc is moving you cant log out. so you would have to cold shut down the game. This has been an ongoing problem with this game and it should really be addressed asap. Until the connection issues are fixed I would not recommend playing this game.",

            "review_text": "In the current state the game is very playable and I did not encounter any major problems. For a Beta game it works very well. Its nice to see that this is a traditional m m o game with some very nice graphics and a good diversity of enemies and mounts. There is a lot of character customizations, skins etc. Gear looks good and different when you get new sets of armor.  Loads of mounts with their own rarity and abilities and you dont have to wait hours for those rares because virtually everything respawns within minutes.  Interesting lore, I was a little less positive about the voice-acting and the game beeing very linear. And the zones, I dont like the zones, I would have loved just one big map. Cities and some outpost have vendors, quest NPC's and guards, it feels pretty empty if you are in the capitals.  There are five roles; beserker, guardian ,assassin, priest and wizard. They have all a unique set of powers and gear.   Personal update one:  There is a nice crafting system, but the loot system could be much better. As for now, its best to do instances with friends or your guild.  Server problems, with some disconnections from time to time.  Making a custom tab is nice to block those channels with all those spammers, but they should really do something about it, people may enjoy the game a bit more.  After many hours, there are a lot of griefers; you can get some mounts only with marks, those marks need materials that are often difficult to farm or very expensive. If people kill the mount you are taming ,your mark is used in the process, adding some unfortunate RNG, it can make things utterly frustrating. On the other side, ones you are skilled in making a certain mark you will be able to craft 1 item and you get 2 instead, slightly RNG based.   Conclusion:  This game is one of the worst beta games I have ever played, I tried to stay positive about it but I can't anymore. The game works fine but the way the game is exploited... Nexon... they made a lot of games, and even without knowing it myself I had a lot of games of this company already; they even made Titanfall!. So I had some good hopes.  We could also wait untill we have the full game, but with false promises, a company that barely cares about their customers, please, keep your money in your pocket and spend your time on other games that is the best advice I can give you about this game.",
