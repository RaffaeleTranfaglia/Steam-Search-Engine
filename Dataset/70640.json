            "review_text": "There are so many versions of Worms out there but the original is the one with--- *Less cartoony graphics - pixel art here instead of smooth cartoons. *Fewer items - you have a good selection of weapons, but the most exotic items are the exploding sheep and banana bomb - no Holy Hand Grenade, Carpet Bomb or jet pack in this version. *Less polish - sound effects are fuzzy and the menus are a bit unwieldy. *Worse AI - computer characters never use ropes, spam the teleport awkwardly, get stuck behind cover and never ever miss with ranged weapons.  But--  Some (me) would say that the original game is superior to 'Worms 2' and every edition since then, most of which are esentially inferior clones or inconsequential tweaks to the sequel. The original is special. Its dated look and feel have aged respectably rather than stagnated (the bright coloured candy canes and bug eyes of Worms 2 look a bit naff today wheras the detailed, carefully-drawn objects here still look wonderful - see the Satan statues straight out of Shadow of the Beast). The smaller selection of weapons make the game more strategic and engaging, allowing it to retain an element of skill and a rising tension. And this version alone retains a great sense of fun and exploration that the many rehashes seem to replace with cynicism.  Only in the original 'Worms' will you find a huge collection of gorgeous, hand-drawn custom stages that smash into pixels when you play on them, or a lovely, extremely 90's full-length re-mix of the theme tune hidden in the options menus. And only here will your worms shout 'suck on this' in a silly voice before shooting a pair of 'wanted criminals' named Robson and Jerome in the face with an uzi. With their last ounce of strength. On the Statue of Liberty. With a worm's face on it. This version has heart!",

It's fun to see how the series has changed since the original from art style to weapons to maps. If you can get this game while on sale like I did it will be worth your money, enough to keep you playing for a good while. I myself dont have all that much time on it but this game still gets a 7/10.",

I spent about $1.50 on this game and I can only think I wasted my money. Take note that all of the gushing reviews are after 0.1 hrs play and all talk about how it was great in the day. Don't get me wrong, this version works well and if you REALLY liked the first game it's still the same, but the series got better after his. AVOID, buy the more up to date versions. Armageddon for eg.",
