            "review_text": "I am of extremely conflicted opinions on this game. TL;DR, this game is unique enough that if you have any interest in its concept at all, you should probably get it at least on sale, in spite of its flaws.   I also will not weigh in on the GOG versus Steam versions debate, as I don't own the GOG version. The GOG/classic PC version is less expensive, and has your clan tula (lands) improvements shown on a map, while the Steam/iOS version has higher resolution support.  That said, the good:  This is a game of serious choice-and-consequence gameplay that isn't bound up in a single black-and-white morality system. It can be a serious game of strategic choice and risk-management, as well as role-playing. The world, in particular, is rather detailed, and while the simulation is rather simple, it does manage to leave a sense of verisimilitude in the world. Other clans have military and economic strengths where their casualties and losses are recorded, and other clans feud and raid in the background without you.  It also avoids the 'snowballing' pitfall of many nation-management games, since there is no real military victory in this game. You cannot hold territory outside your tula, and only through extreme difficulty can you expand it. Trying to kill all of a certain species leads to disaster, as you cannot accomplish it alone. Although the game rarely tells you as much, it's a game of diplomacy, and if you enjoy playing the diplomat route in RPGs, you'll probably enjoy this game.  This is a game that tries the almost unique feat of basically being a visual novel-type choose-your-own adventure game that is also mostly procedural. It has a complex story made of random events and random characters. It also has a (non-randomized) worldbuilding lore that has quite a bit of depth and I personally just love mythological stories.  When the game works, it lets you sweat out serious choices of balancing risks like whether to tell your irreplaceable warchief to risk his life to drive off a fierce invading force, or whether to hang back, even if it condemns more of your (relatively more replacable) front-line soldiers to their deaths or even risk losing the battle and seeing your lands raided.  Then, there is the bad: This is a game that unfortunately suffers quite a bit for simply never telling you the information you need to know to make proper decisions. At first, it seems like trial-and-error gameplay where you have 'hints' provided from your advisors, although you quickly learn they're generally useless as they always give the same advice no matter the actual circumstance. (The warrior types will advise killing everything or offending anyone who CURRENTLY has a smaller army than you do. The tricksters will tell you to lie to or cheat everyone you meet. The diplomatic types base all judgements on who hates you the most at the moment. None of them keep your overarching strategic goal in mind, and they're often wrong, but then again, the results of events are random, anyway, and they always disagree down predictable lines, so that's no real surprise.) However, when you start to understand some of the mechanics beyond what is just the random events, you start to realize the real fatal flaw in King of Dragon Pass:  In general, I love Crusader Kings 2, but I hate the events in that game because they feel so cheap and two-dimensionally random in a game that is otherwise fleshed-out, simulated, and whose mechanical underpinnings you can not only see and understand, but also manipulate when you understand them. In this game, it's nearly entirely those random events, and you can't see most of the mechanics, much less understand how to manipulate them properly.  For example, while other clans feud and raid behind your back, you have absolutely no way of knowing this happens. You will also suddenly find you made an enemy out of a former friend because you made friends with someone they hated, without the game ever giving you ANY hint this would happen. This is an 'invisibility of information' problem that plagues this game to its core: It has a complex set of inter-related parts going on under the surface, but the player is left utterly blind to the workings of these mechanics.   This is worse than mere trial-and-error gameplay. Trial-and-error gameplay, while frustrating, at least follows a logical cause-and-effect. You come across three doors, and opening any of the 'wrong' doors instantly killing your character at least follows a logical cause-and-effect that you can understand how to avoid the next time you play. When a friendly clan suddenly declares a feud upon you for slights you don't believe you ever committed, however, there's absolutely no way for the player to understand what caused this effect, or IF it was even any of their choices which caused that effect at all.   It's at times a game that hands you a panel full of buttons, and when you press some, will randomly either pat you on the head or scream at you for what a horrible failure your entire life has been, even when you performed the exact same actions in the exact same sequence, and it leaves the player utterly baffled as to what went wrong. These are especially bad in the cases of those invisible feuds between other clans - there is never any way for the player to understand that these feuds even exist, so they have no means of understanding when they are treding upon someone else's toes, and therefore, have no reason to expect that event that SAID it resulted in gaining renown will suddenly cause you to instead LOSE renown without there being any warning other than your relations suddenly souring.  It's not that the game doesn't track these things: It absolutely tracks who gets angry for what reason, but it just doesn't  tell you  things that should be obvious. For example, when negotiating within a tribe, it will say 'two clans are offended by the concessions you made to other clans,' without saying  who  was offended by  what  concessions. There's really no way to find out besides repeated savescumming and trial-and-error sussing out of the key variables. The end result is that you make guesses on too little information, then get told that some of your choices were apparently bad, but not told which ones, with no way of learning from past mistakes. That really offends some deep-seated gamer part of me: Games should be about learning the mechanics and building up skill to do better the next time, but this game denies that to players.",

            "review_text": "(Ignore my game time, I play on a different account) Wow. Just wow. This game is great. Deep lore with fantasy elements and featuring it's own mythology that is all provided in a nice coherent compendium that you can easily access at any given time, a ludicrous amount of quests, events and an ungodly massive cast of characters makes this one of the best text adventure/strategy games I've ever played. It even comes with an easy to comprehend tutorial that walks you through the basics of managing your tribe. It actually makes me think of Romance of the Three Kingdoms X except with far more events and quests that have some sort of effect on your Clan. It also does a great job of putting you in the seat of a Leader where hard choices have to be made, most of which are going to have major effects on the Tribe. Just as a heads up, don't ♥♥♥♥ too many people off, you'll regret it. Definitely a recommended title!  Review and Gameplay:         YouTube™ Video:  King of Dragon Pass Gameplay and Review&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "KODP is a true strategy game fans dream come true, who wants to venture into the unknown with nothing but imagination and mystery. this is a true game where choices matter for each and every player and each and every play through. Dont mind the graphics or the audio just the narrative of the story is enough to keep you entertained for hours if not days.Its a game with subtle realities as you lead your clan to the unknown in hopes of some day becoming the king of a mythical land named Dragon Pass.  You start the game with a ring of ministers chosen by you, trying to look out for the betterment of your people. But before all this you must choose a specific mythology for your people to believe in as a religion and here the game has lore. These decisions influence the nature of the game. As does the in-game decisions.  The decisions vary as in where do you send explorers on the map to explore, how much magic do you allocate to which resource, which clans do you raid or wtih whom do you ally. Here it must be said that the game can be a bit dull in comparison to more modern version of its counterpart. For the battle mechanics is absent and it solely depends on what numbers do you or your foe has. However it may also be pointed out that the game as it is doesnt need any separate battle mechanics.  To play this game you must read a lot of the ingame narrative, else you risk the lose of plot. So it is a game of patience more than any cunning strategy. But patience has its own reward in form of story, lore and your options to play the game. You get to worship a pantheon of gods in the game and complete a host of quests. Fullfilling which you get a host of bonuses. Magic is an ingame resource, so are goods, food and cattle. You get to call in favours in the game for variuos activities.  The graphics of the game is old, so are the music not too well refined. But the story of the game is enough to keep you playing, so much so that you dont need graphics to play this game. All in all this game has many positives and relatively less negetives. But to name a few :-  PROS  + Story rich (it keeps you entertained for hours if not days) + Every choice has a different consequence + Lots of strategy and lore involved in this game + Fluid storyline  CONS  - You have to be an avid reader to play this game, for the game has a lot of reading to begin with.(Perfect for old school strategy gamers) - Poor graphics - not too well refined music  All in all this game is definitely geetable specially if on sale. A solid 7.5/10   (I recieved this game for free from Y.A. for reviewing purposes but that has in no way affected the quality of this review)",

Because the results are revealed in story, often with hours of play passing, you are not sure what factors accumulated to produce a result. The game displays very little 'number crunching' that's available to the player. What the game provides are principals of how your clan should be run. Over time the player comes to understand the logic of how to govern.  The text of the game includes over 600,000 words. Much like reading a very good long novel, the richness of the story is gradually revealed.  I estimate the 'long' version of a 'normal' difficulty game takes over 20 hours to complete. I've found the game to have excellent replay value. You can take exactly the same actions in exactly the same situation and produce different results. Even better, taking a different action will often reveal a previously unseen portion of the game.  On the downside, I've found the 'hard' version of the game to be tedious. Earlier in 2016 the game was updated with many bugs fixed and new story content added. There are bugs that remain, but they are minor and do not interfere with the game overall.",
