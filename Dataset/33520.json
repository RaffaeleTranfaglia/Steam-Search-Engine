            "review_text": "After much debate, this game gets a thumbs up, for one main reason: nostalgia. I played the crap out of this game when I was a kid, and upon rediscovering it, proceeded to continue to play the crap out of it. If you're unfamiliar, this is a simulation where you play a dictator of a small caribbean island. The plots and themes are all very cliche'd, but humorously delivered by a suck-up lackey of yours, Penultimo ('the second to last,' if you're keeping up with your spanish). You can be kind or ruthless, out for a buck or for glory, but in the end, this is a solid, interesting game worthy, I think, of a modern gamer's time. HOWEVER... if you have played the newest Tropico (4, at this point), I would not recommend this one to you. The gameplay is more or less identical, but the options are significantly fewer and the graphics aren't remotely of the caliber of modern games. Additionally, it should be noted that this game relies very heavily on latino sterotypes, and while I (a Latin American History major, but with no soul) found it amusing, many of the japes could be found highly offensive. So, in essence:  Recommended for: players of strategy simulations, people who enjoy latin american history in a comical simulated retelling, or those who are interested to see how a game series has evolved from it's origins.  Not recommended for: Enthusiasts of the newest games, those demanding high quality graphics, or folk who will be easily offended by latino sterotypes.",

            "review_text": "This game is perfect if you want to spend those few hours of free time you have left after you finished your studies or chores. That is, untill you get the hang of it... Then it turns into a time consuming all-encompassing simulator that will demand your very life essence until the day you decide to actually stop playing it and make up for all the time you have commited to Tropico.  All in all it is a great game. Sure the graphics may be a bit old but this is a classic that will have you coming back over and over again replaying it and trying to find a new and ingenious way to be a dictator jackass or a saint in heels.",

One of the best economic and political simulators out there. If you like building cities, managing resources, and sending out raiding parties to supplement your income, play Tropico 2!!",

            "review_text": "Having never played Tropico before, but getting the series at a good price, I thought I'd give the older games a go to see how the series progressed over the years.   Graphically , Tropico looks a lot like the older Roller Coaster Tycoon series. It's not beautiful by any means, but it's not without its charm either.   Gameplay  is pretty straight forward: you're the dictator of an island and you need to keep your people happy while balancing politics and economics. There isn't a lot of micromanagement like the Sim City games, and the entire experience feels pretty relaxed and entertaining.  There isn't a huge diversity of buildings available, but there are enough to feel like the game has sufficient content. There are also various scenareos all featuring different maps, and if that's not enough, you can generate a random map to your own specifications.  The only complaint I have against Tropico is that there are some resolution issues, and the information tab kept opening itself every few minutes. The tab may have been a local issue, or it may have been a glitch. Not game-breaking, but still annoying.   All in all, Tropico is still a very playable game even today.  That said, I don't know if it's worth investing your time and money unless you're nostalgic or looking to experience the series as it aged (like I was). I only say this because the newer games in the series have all received mostly positive reviews, and there really isn't any reason to take two steps back unless its an experience you're exclusively looking for.   To all the citizens of Tropico I failed: lo siento, mi amigos - no soy un buen dictador. ",

            "review_text": "Game of my childhood &lt;3. And surprisingly, it has aged pretty well. Of course if you consider the fact, that there are two other titles (yeah, I'm excluding Pirate Cove...), which have better graphic, mechanics and all of that, in theory there's really no reason to go back to this one other than sentiment. Game works well with Windows 7, which is really good, since even some of the newer games ('Fallout 3'... Khem, khem...) often have problems with that. There are few graphic glitches, but nothing major. And few bugs. A little more major.   Pros: + well aged game  + music + our lovely adviser &lt;3  + humor + many missions with different difficulty levels (some of them are really easy, some of are truly challenging) + cynicism of those who have power (reality 10/10).  Cons: - bugs - unfortunately some of them make your mission impossible or at least much harder to win - you're workers for some reasons, suddenly, just can go to some place and before you realize that, you already have a few building around this part, etc.",

Don't get me wrong there are some thing I wish could be added from the newer games but those just don't feel like Tropico. Hells some islands on the newer ones are 80% unusable area where in the original the entire island can be built on.",

The game is OK at best, bad at worst with two game bundled into one (seems like a good deal right?) [Tropico &amp; Tropico 2: Pirate Cove].   When I first got into them, the intro seemed promising with characters that I'd normally see in a Tropico game (excluding hookers, that was kinda a first) and the game begins with a cool, yet awkward title screen. It also was hard to move around, however, I've gotten through it. Eventually, I get to the scenario screen and I can choose a pre-created character. It's slightly dissappointing that I can only pick characters the programmers created and not create your own dictator of Tropico, however, it makes up for it by choosing to be either Fidel Castro or Che Guevara.  Eventually, you load the game and you can create your nation. This is where it begins to fall apart, it feels kinda clunky and stiff. It still has the mechanics of Tropico, it just feels awkward coming from me. Anyways, my score for this game is a:  6/10  It's above average, it's ok and it would've been lower if they haven't had my favorite revolutionaries like Che or Castro.",
