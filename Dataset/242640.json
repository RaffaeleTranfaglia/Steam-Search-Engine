            "review_text": "Well, long story short, this is a hardcore stealth game. Would seriously only recommend to those who like the old school stealth games, or are used to bumping up the difficulty settings in the newer ones. It's not a bad game...no, not at all. Just that anyone who's going to be playing this for anything other than stealth will have to endure a mightily frustrating time! I consider myself a semi-hardcore (if there's such a thing even) stealth gamer and I found it just a tad frustrating on Hard difficulty. No complaints though...I'm gonna man up!  Anyways, the biggest pro is that the levels are huge (like really huge...it took me just under 2.5 hours to complete the intro alone!). Lots of routes to take, and there's lots of verticality to it. There are ample number of collectibles to find, and potions to collect and conjure more magic tricks. And you are encouraged to not kill anyone, or not be detected, or steal all loot by unlocking rewards at the end of levels. AI seems to be decent too, if not unforgiving!   The stealth elements are standard from what you'd get in Thief for example. Guards can see you when you are in light and in their line of sight. They can hear you (even tripping over pails and broomsticks). And you can hide in the shadows, where a tattoo on your body will glow orange. However, you cannot abuse the shadows as much as Thief. Even when you think you are in a dark area, if a guard comes too close, he will smell you out.   Story is so-so for me. Too early to read too much into it. Visuals are just OK as well. Some textures look like they're brought right in from 1998 though. But on the plus side, I get to max out this game on my meager GTX 750 and get 60fps most of the time at 1080p. So yeah, it's not at all graphically demanding. Voice acting is mediocre as well. Nothing bad, but nothing memorable either. The same goes for the soundtrack/sound effects.   The controls are a little finicky and you will need to spend time in the early game to get used to them. Certain jumping actions are not properly explained in the tutorial. But aside from the jumping controls, the movement controls of Styx otherwise are solid.   In closing, the game feels like the most brutal stealth game I've played, and I can assure you I've played just about all of them released in the past 5 years. Still it should be a good challenge, and I assume as I progress and get used to the gameplay more, the experience will only get better.",

            "review_text": "This is my first proper review so please forgive any armature shortcomings.  Let me start off by saying that, before buying this game I did a lot of review reading and found quite a few negative points. The most prominent of these points being 1.Graphics 2.Game mechanics (mostly due to ledge detection) 3.Poor controls 4.The map 5.The Combat system and a few more smaller issues that I’ll get to later  1.  Graphics  No the graphics are not great. The general scenery I found to be appealing, but when you look a little closer you will notice how this games graphics really are a let-down. Faces are jus.... well let’s say they could be improved. But when did a games graphics become more important than gameplay when considering buying a game?  2. Game mechanics  The biggest issue people seem to have with this is ledge detection, I personally haven't missed any (well placed) jumps due to this on my end. I don't really see much of an issue with regard to ledges myself, sure Styx enjoys hovering in mid-air just off the edge of a ledge but that can be forgiven. (You can't however hang-crawl from one ledge to another...) Other mechanics issues tend to be with shadowy spots being difficult to determine, which is true it isn't easy to tell whether Styx is hidden from view judging on whether it seems he is in a shadowy spot or not, BUT he does have a tattoo on his arm which lights up when he IS hidden (very easy to see and make use of)   3. Poor controls  This seems to be causing people to miss jumps and plummet to their deaths, are they perhaps just not good at the game? I couldn't say, what I can say is that (again) I haven’t had any real issues with this, but then again I have only played the game with a (Xbox 360) controller so I don't have any real experience using a keyboard to control Styx.  4. The map  It's terrible, it will NOT help you don’t use it.  That being said, it encourages the player to explore the areas a little more. Although some navigational input via a map that actually helped would be nice.  5. The Combat system   is not fun it isn’t engaging and it leaves Styx utterly useless at fighting... well pretty much anything.  THIS IS A HARDCORE STEALTH GAME! If you're using the combat system you're doing it wrong   Side Notes  I read that someone found it frustrating that there was no way to distract enemies.  All I have to say to this is THERE IS A WAY. Styx is able to make a noise (default is hold 'x' on the keyboard or 'down' on a gamepad) this noise will lure guards to the source of the notice. 'Great' you say thinking how useful it's going to be luring all guards to your current location. But fear not! Your clone can also make a noise, in the same way Styx does. So move your clone around the other side of enemies press 'x' and boom guards walk towards the noise and out of your way.  THE PROS  -It's got an interesting story -The Gameplay is absolutely wonderful (personal opinion here) -It's difficult! Which leads to much planning and enjoyment of your success -Huge maps, with multiple ways of navigating and completing levels -STEALTH STEALTH STEALTH! This is a stealth game, it relies heavily on stealth, and stealth is needed to accomplish anything! So if you're a fan of stealth games this is for you  One last thing Quicksaving IS your friend do not be scared to use it ",

To give you an idea on how hidden you can play, most of the levels took me around 1 to 2 hours to finish, where there is a level that took me 4 hours along a week, because I was trying to complete everything without being detected, without killing anyone and taking all tokens (secrets present in every level).  The story is also VERY surprising at the end.   The best game I played in 2015 (I haven't played Fallout 4, TW3 or other 2015 game, so that counts towards what I played this year).",

Verticality is the name of the game, with hundreds of meters-tall set pieces. The story is excellent and funny. Very unique and interesting characters as well. The lore is super compelling and unique as well. It feels like a game inspired by a book series. It's that original.   My only real complaints are the difficulty (Mainly in the fact that there's almost NO SUPPLIES. ANYWHERE. Makes you constantly stretched for ammo/potions.) and the repetitiveness of some sections. The developers clearly didn't have the funds to make new places a few times, so they make you backtrack through areas.   A sequel named Styx: Shards of Darkness is coming out soon as well! It's a universe I'm excited to see evolve as the developers get more attention and funds.",

            "review_text": "Old-school style stealth game that will not let you win easily. First few levels are normally challenging with several deaths and the more you get into game, the more you will die, like every 30 seconds mostly. You really have to play stealthy, there is no space for heroics or fair fight. YOu have to sneak behind enemies and use all your wit, there are a few magical abilities like invisibility to help, but it wont help you every time, it lasts shortly and killing all enemies is not the way either. Some are immortal, some incredibly hard to kill and fighting more than one enemy straight on will definitely lead to your death. Really challenging, plus decent story and enjoyable stealth coming from gameplay and level design.",

OR YOU CAN JUST GO BADASS ON THEM AND KILL THEM ALL WITH YOUR MARTIAL ARTS AND GUN BLAZING!' But this game you can't do that. I mean, you could do that... But good luck, cuz the enemies actually attack AT THE SAME TIME instead of one by one, and you die in one hit by certain enemies.  Anyway, all in all this is a good stealth game, not perfect though because of their low budget, but good enough.   Only complaint is when I'm trying to secretly stack bodies, and one body so happen to just fling into the air and alerts a gaurd somewhere. Funny to watch, but annoying to play with. Oh yea you have to save a lot too.  If this review is being read at all and you're still not interested in this game, there will be a sequel to this game soon.",

The main character is a kinda likeable a-hole antihero, and the language gets pretty crude. The environments are well designed and interesting to explore, but the controls are too often imprecise, so be prepared to use the quick load feature a LOT. If the idea of a third-person stealth game outside of a Splinter Cell or Metal Gear setting appeals to you, and you can deal with some frustrating deaths, there's plenty of fun to be had. One WTF-style question, though: why aren't there ANY female characters in the game?",

            "review_text": "If not one of the best games of the year, this game is, at least, the best bang-for-your-buck of a title in recent memory.  The Gamespot review for this title is absolutely baffling and just shows what a shadow of its former self it has become. The aforementioned review cites the game's poor combat as one primary reason for its low review score. Yet, the reviewer seems to be completely ignorant of the fact that the game has deliberately made 'combat' as cumbersome and ill-rewarding as possible for a key reason: This is a pure stealth game.  This is a genre that has been dormant for several years; this is not Assasin's Creed: where stealth is an *option*, as is slicing through dozens of soldiers like it's no big deal.   Here, killing silently in the shadows is the name of the game: emphasis on the word, 'killing'. Unlike recent so-called stealth titles like 'Dishonored' that actively punish you for killing (why place such emphasis on this mechanic then?), Styx has no such qualms about wholesale stealthy slaughter.   The gameworld is something to behold: A giant metrolpolis built around a mystical elven tree that stretches off to the clouds. Something of a quasi-medieval Coruscant.  One unexpected thing I experienced upon playing the game is how surprisingly well written the story actually is: The story, whilst confusing at first, is actually quite well written and the twist that is delivered in the latter-half of the game, is fantastic.  TLDR: The game *punishes* confrontational behaviour;' this is a pure stealth game. For enthusiasts of this once-dormant genre, you'll find it an immensely rewarding experience. The surprisingly well written story and plot-twist is a welcome surprise.l",

            "review_text": "PLOT- The plot is detailed, orignal and reinforced by small chance dialogue placed throughout the levels. However the overall effect doesn't engage the player as much as it should. It does have a unique story and world. 7/10  STEALTH- The stealth mechanics for the most part are things we've seen before. The AI rarely looks up or sees anything in the slightest darkness. However the cloning mechanic is fun and fairly unique and everything to do with the stealth plays very solidly. Sound is used in the same way we've seen in the past however, I'd say these enemies are more sensative to sound than most seen in other stealth games. 9/10  COMBAT- This could almost be considered a part of stealth. The game punishes any combat with a horribly clunky mini-game that I cannot imagine anyone finding fun at all. In a stealth game this is the type of thing I love. However if you are looking to fight and kill the enemies in this game you will hate it. 8/10  ACHIEVEMENTS- The achievements in this game were completely reasonable and not very grindy. The problem comes in 2 forms. First, the AI on the enemies is slightly broken and they can accidentily push each other off ledges. This leads to a kill on a kill free run often enough that I had to redo a few missions multiple times because of it. Second, two of the achievments cannot be earned on a save that is set to the hardest difficulty. On the most difficult setting the game doesn't allow the combat minigame and if you are ever directly engaged by the enemy you just die. However two achievements require you to kill enemies using the direct combat. After completeing all achievements on the hardest mode I was forced to start a new save and play on a lower setting in order to complete the last two. Mission replay is available after completion with very clear guages telling you if you have killed, set off an alarm, how long you are taking, and how many hidden coins you've collected. I found this a rare and valuable addition to the game. 7.5/10  OVERALL- If you love stealth games, this is something you should play. It has everything that makes the stealth genre good with very few of the more recent additions that detract from the stealth ambience. The reuse of maps was a bit lazy and the errors I've described in AI galled me a bit. I would hope to see more unique maps and smarter AI in a sequel. That said I give it 8/10.",

But deep inside the tower of Akenash, a conspiracy from the humans against the elves is already made and they have their own plan with the Heart. War is coming, and rakash just can't ignore it. But what he can do when those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can bash rakash's head in one hit ? Hide inside the shadow, reach higher places, use covers and press F5. A lot.  Oh rakash you little ♥♥♥♥ing rat, you haven't learned anything don' cha ? Amber is a blessing, not a curse. The tattoo marks your shadow shield. Your army of clones is ready to serve you, from binding a guard to being a mobile smoke bomb. Your amber vision is what made you a superior creature than those so-called themselves 'superior race', humans can't see you through walls, but you can. Your invisibility can help you deal with most situations, so use it as your advantage when an orc blocks your way.  Now, you think you're ready to make those filthy humans pay ? No you're not. This is not some child's play for modern stealth-ACTION gamer. Hiding in the shadow doesn't make little rakash completely safe. Every jump counts, every action you made must be precise. Don't blame anything if you fail, because it's your fault. Little rakash just needs more training, and he doesn't go into a corner and cry because he kept failing a jump, right ?  rakash rarely sees daylight, but he has lived long enough to see the beautiful and corrupted skyward tower of Akenash, the dark prison deep inside the dungeon, and stupid and fugly modeled guards too. At least rakash has a reason to kill all of 'em now.  rakash was born in a dried up lake bed. There was a big dead tree. Dozens of his kind crawling around, like rats. But he was not like them. He was a rat of another kind. Everything he could remember was a name - Styx. He's coming, for everything he has lost, for a reason why he exists, and for redemption... and he will blow your mind.  This is not your modern kiddie stealth game, this is the true stealth-action game that we hardcore fans of the genre has been waiting for. It feels clunky in a great way, it does everything right in term of stealth gameplay, it has great artstyle despite technical issues, and most of all, it will test your sense, your skill and your patience.  It's been a long time coming, rakash. Now it's time to change your fate.",

If you're looking for a spot on review, I'd recommend you check out GameSpot's review, as I feel exactly the same as they do. The AI system is loaded with bugs (which can be really annoying at times), jumping to and grabbing ledges is often more difficult than it should be, and the fighting system is horrible. You're locked into fighting one guard, having to perry their blows by pressing a button at just the right moment, and while you're doing this, the other guards around you are attacking you, often from a distance with throwing knives, and there's nothing you can do to stop them, making being detected almost always an immediate 'load previous game' moment. This can be avoided by simply pressing the quick save button literally every 5 minutes, or as soon as you do someting that you're not sure you'd be able to do again, whichever comes first. But despite all it's bugs, the fact that the plot is really hard to follow (and the cut scenes are voiced over watercolor paintings, rather than 3D animations) and the fact that I (one who is terrible at video games, but loves them anyway) beat the game in under two weeks (35 hours of play), I still thoroughly enjoyed playing.",

In order to fall and grab a ledge you have to walk slowly off instead of pressing 'B' or 'O' or whatever. And if you want to jump at a ledge and hang instread of climb directly up you have to hold 'A' or 'Jump' whatever.  This was a huge complaint when the game first came out but, if you learn how this game uses the environment/controls you'll be just fine.  Overall - 9/10. If you find enjoyment by moving through a level and not being detected by anyone, pick this game up!  Extras -   I played this game on Hard mode and got a ton of extra skill points by doing two of the four Insignias every level except the last - 1. Don't kill anyone and 2. Don't be detected.  This made the game /significantly/ more difficult but equally rewarding. I used F5 (Quicksave) and F9 (Quickload) quite a bit.",

            "review_text": "Personal Rating: 6.5 of 10  Styx and stone may break your bones...Well literally. Styx is a stealth infiltration game with much potential. Little do I know that this game was actually set within the 'Of Orcs and Men' universe. The game has interesting story but fails terrible in presenting them in game. You have to pick up the bits and pieces to figure out what is going on. The voice acting is fine really but they can really put in works for the story board and dialog.  Graphics wise is not top notch but suffice. Rarely there are glitches nor bugs but the ledge hanging detection can be nuisance sometimes.   You basically receive a quest to infiltrate certain location and traverse through an intermediate sized map to complete your quest with optional jobs in most of the area. The game play however is rather repetitive and even there are multiple approach for you to tackle your goal. The areas are reused heavily in later stages with more and more enemies and lesser option for you to progress or killing them. The enemy A.I. are quite similar and you can expect most of them to behave the same except some higher ranking ones have better awareness.  If you are up for a challenge, try completing the game with the given challenges which is the hardest and time consuming part of the game. You don't get much reward for them except for the satisfaction and extra experience for you skills. Speaking of which, I find only some of the skills are worth investing in it and actually makes a different in helping you in game. The best thing is, in order for you to acquire all the achievements you do not need to actually complete all the challenges.   Another drawback of the game is that it lack of mini map or at least a map that shows your current location. You are only given a sketch of the layout and some rather vague landmarks of the area in the map. The rest, you have to figure out on your own, which then again, have close to zero usefulness.   You may come across puzzles sometimes but really nothing challenging but finding all relics may put you up for a test and the biggest one of all is actually figuring the location of the relic itself.   Overall, Styx isn't a bad game if you are into stealth games and I will definitely up for its sequel if there are improvement in the areas that I mentioned.",

            "review_text": "I haven't played an stealth game this good since Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. The fact that this game was made in the current generation is a glimmer of hope that great stealth games can still be made.  Performance is perfectly optimized; nice graphics and low system requirements. Fluid controls. Huge levels. Long missions. Solid stealth system. A great story. A good price. And best of all, there is no DLC. It's as though this game has everything!  Certainly, this is not a perfect game. The combat system for instance is terrible, which consists in engaging in a relatively difficult QTE-block/dodge duel of swords with one enemy all at the same time his fellow guards are shooting arrows and throwing stuff at you which you must also dodge. But given this is a pure stealth game I guess combat is irrelevant (the point is to be a ghost, if you're spotted you're done).  The game provides a lot of freedom to deal with enemies and complete objectives; gameplay elements such as using clones, smoke explosions, invisibility, poisoning food and drinks, and several takedown abilities makes it perfect for creativity and experimentation, and the huge level encourage exploration, and the discovery and execution of new tactics every time you play. There is an RPG feature which consists of experience points you gain by performing specific tasks. Unlocking skills and powers requires XP points, but you can only do it when you're not in a mission. In addition to checkpoints (auto saves) it also allows to quick save/load at your own discretion (something that is becoming rare in this consolized age).  The controls are so fluid that it fools you into thinking you can do anything, jump any distance or reach any ledge without effort. It takes some time and practice to master it. Knowing exactly when to jump, crouch, walk, slow down or sprint is key in this game. This is one of the things I love about it, the precision of your movements rely completely on you and only you, there is no 'Press A to Parkour'. Of course, since the game isn't perfect there are rare occasions when ledge detection doesn't work the way you'd expect, like some edges you can't grab on to, or others where you are 'magnetically' attached to. Also, if you plug in a controller the character movement is still digital (you can only walk or run), which makes playing with an analog stick feel weird.  The stealth system is incredibly fine-tuned. One wrong move and you're done. Guards are definitely not shortsighted, and have a good hearing too. Dark areas DON'T mean you're safe, they only mean you're SLIGHTLY LESS LIKELY to be seen, as in, enemies will take a couple more seconds to realize you're there. Also, enemies ARE NOT fools: if you arise suspicion however slightly they will start checking corners, under tables, inside vases, etc.; stay in a single spot and you're done. And that is only regarding humans, I won't even mention the other enemies in the game for the sake of not spoiling the story. Ok, whatever, here goes a spoiler at your own risk:   elves  WILL SMELL YOU  from a distance. There. You can quit stealth games now.    You're also required to be very careful where you step into, as sometimes there will be clutter laying around as if it were on purpose (of course it is! Broomsticks around corners, buckets in the frame of windows, obstructing chairs when under desks and tables) which make noises that won't be ignored. One negative point in my opinion is that the physics engine is exaggerated when it comes to clutter: no matter how slow you sneak, pass too close and even the slightest graze can send a wooden chair flying across the room alerting everyone in the area.  About the length, it took me about 50 hours to finish the game and reach 100% completion in a single playthrough in normal difficulty. Doing other playthroughs with harder difficulties makes the game a whole different, as some tactics that worked before may not work this time, urging you to make different approaches. Another negative point I can think of is that increasing the difficulty only affects the sensitivity and strength of the enemies and not gameplay per se. It would have been nice if there were less resources, add more guards, tighten patrol patterns, add a time limit, etc. Although I believe you can achieve this by restricting yourself while playing (in my case, i'd sometimes play never using any powers at all, and/or if I screw up i'd restart the whole zone or the entire mission depending on my mood).  This game is the closest thing we have to true hardcore stealth in the current generation, and I recommend you play this even if you're not quite into stealth because it's a beautifully crafted product that can't be missed and one of the best games ever made in my opinion. If this doesn't make you truly appreciate stealth, nothing will.",

Or maybe it's just because I've gotten better at them that I remember them being way more difficult than todays games. Either way, Styx: Master of Shadows is a hard game. Now I could say quite a few bad things about this game. The graphics in-game are somewhat poor (in cutscenes they're great). The models of moving things in the game are constantly clipping inside themselves. The lack of variety in voice acting is extremely noticeable. They certainly make the game less immersive.  But in terms of gameplay, Styx is an incredible game. It's a stealth game that is VERY heavily focused on you not being seen; if two or more guards catch you sneaking about, you're screwed. But the controls are so smooth and work so well with the environment that, with some clever thinking, you might never be seen by anyone. The levels are extremely well-designed as well. They have a great amount of verticality to them, and there are hundreds of routes you can take through any level. There are collectibles you can find around the map that give you bonuses, as well as secondary objectives that can be completed on the way.   Styx also has a fairly customizable skill tree, where you can put points into being sneaky, becoming a killing machine, or having invisible clones. One thing I don't like about the game is how it gives you lots of options for how you can kill people, which are all great fun to pull off, and yet the game gives you extra rewards for not killing anyone in the level.   Overall, Styx is definitely worth buying, especially if you catch it on sale. The customizability of Styx himself and the varied level designs mean you'll be able to spend a great deal of time on this game and not get bored.",

Except it's much more than that.  The gameplay focuses heavily on stealth elements, and the climbing is reminiscent of Assassin's Creed. The character (Styx) can create a clone to provide distractions so you can get away safely, or you can simply become invisible to get away from a group of guards, because unlike in Assassin's Creed, Styx can't handle a full batallion of guards or so and get away completely unscathed. As such, it tells you that you need to be undetected as much as possible, though you can handle the occasional single guard or two (After reloading your save a few times, of course.). It uses the Unreal Engine, so the graphics are pretty stellar, and I've yet to find any SD textures.  I preordered the game, and it was completely worth it. I haven't had this much fun in a stealth game since I played through Dishonored, and Dishonored was amazing. The voice acting is good, and the voices fit the characters well. Though, in the game engine cutscenes the lip syncing isn't that great, but it's ignorable, and besides, the rest of the game makes you forget the lip syncing issues.",

Styx doesn't corral you into playing a certain way. You are rewarded for being more stealthy, but aren't berated for killing.  4. Exploration. It's not open-world, but there is a lot of time spent exploring -- escape routes and ambush spots.  The BAD 1. Interminably long. There are far, far too many chapters. Could have avoided this by not recycling the areas. 2. Recycled zones. I'd rather cut chapters off the game than go back to the same areas. You literally play the same puzzle at the end that you played earlier in the game. Lame. 3. Difficulty increases simply by adding more enemies and unkillable ones. 4. Skills/Perks were disappointing.

The ending was empty, unsatisfying, and left me feeling trolled. I would say the end was predictable, but I never actually thought it could be this bad. I spend 41 hours in this game, and grew to like my character, then let down hard at the end with no sense of reward, satisfaction, or even vindication.

So how do you go around corners when you want to shimmy around? You climb up in front of the guards, hold SHIFT to crawl to the other corner and then walk off and Styx will turn around and grab it and you can continue your shimmy... but if the guard sees you? Guess what? He'll run over and pull you up and you're stuck in that damn parry-lock!!!  That parry-lock mode is driving me freaking insane!!! Better designed games like Assassin's Creed lets you escape combat with ease by just holding down the sprint button!! not this game... nah, this game makes you get locked into combat and you either have to lose most of your health trying to back out or actually do the parry three time to kill the guard whilst the other one attacks you... pretty much in this game? Avoid combat at all costs because Styx sucks at combat more than he sucks at maneuvering around the open world.  Now that I've talked about the worst parts of the game... let's talk about the good...  The levels are nice and huge and the game looks great.  The AI can be pretty smart and can spot you in areas where the shadows aren't super dark (technically they should always be able to see you due to that glowing tattoo kind of like the night vision goggles in Splinter Cell but they don't because game play lol).  The music is also very nice with grim violins and other various mood setting music.  But in conclusion? I was hoping for another fun stealth game to tinker around with... but this game is damn clunky... not as clunky and mediocre as cyanide studios other game 'Of Orcs and Men' but still damn clunky. Only get this game if it's on sale for a REALLY low price. Styx is definitely not the master of shadows but he seems better at them than Garret (from Thief) these days...",

It's advanced-medieval style, creature design, character clothing and inclusion of such elements as flying ships and vast bottomless pits is extremely comparable to the series of novels, 'The Edge Chronicles', by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddel. Although intended for a younger audience similar to Harry Potter and Percy Jakcson, the series far surpasses them with its intriguing, mature, and sometimes macabre universe and story. Its dark, and masterfully crafted illustrations help propel the written text to higher planes of wonderous excellence It is most certainly a book series that would be better enjoyed by an adult audience. I can not say for certain if Styx is influenced by The Edge Chronicles , but the similarities are there. If you enjoyed either the game or the book series, I would most certainly recommend the other. Or, if youre simply interested in a fascinating fantasy game, I would recommend Styx: Master of Shadows.",

I'd have a lot more to say, if the game didn't have a bug making me unable to continue to the second level.  There is a replay function, giving you the option to replay a mission, which has put some people stuck in between mission one and two, with no other solution other than starting over again, this has been documented and the developers have even responded to threads about it, but after 7+ months it has still not been patched. This is game-breaking. Not all players will experience it, but obviously, you don't want to get stuck an hour or so into the game, having only completed the first mission.  I can't endorse this game for this reason, and would advice you strongly against buying it.",

It's definitely a challenge -- Thief-style map (i.e. has no 'you are here' marker), lots of objects to accidentally knock over, limited inventory and highly-sensitive guard AI. The highlight of the game for me is that there are  tons  of ways to make your way from Point A to Point B in this game; There doesn't seem to be a 'golden path', or even 'alternative paths' -- you feel as if you're forging your own path every time. On a related note, the levels are enormous, and the level design is fantastic (in my opinion). Environment/world design is interesting and pleasing to the eye as well.  There are a few significant flaws, which might be a dealbreaker for some: dialogue and storyline are lackluster, graphics are nothing to write home about (Unreal 3), combat is clunky (but do you  really  want to be getting into combat?), NPC AI is kind of dumb most of the time (but predictable, at least -- also, I saw in the credits that they only had one poor soul working on AI... that sucks!), and Assassin's Creed-esque ledge-grabbing doesn't always work the way you want it to. Also, I had the same complaint about Dishonored, but the 'stats' screen that shows number of kills, number of people alerted, etc., only comes up at very end of each multi-part level. That can be really painful when you're trying achieve a 'no alert, no kill' run.  Despite the game's flaws, Styx: Master of Shadows is exactly what the doctor ordered, and has some serious replayability value. Definitely worth the price.",

Cons: 1. Extremely large amount of bugs, from random graphical glitches to being seen by the AI through walls. I have seriously been pulled through walls by the AI along with other serious gameplay bugs. 2. Gameplay is difficult for the sole purpose of being difficult. It's not challenging, just annoying as hell. 3. Linear gameplay. You are forced to play the exact way the developers want you to. An example of this is one of the earlier levels where you can't be seen or have a body seen otherwise you have to start over. 4. Extremely bad combat. More often than not it's literally impossible to fight people. It honestly makes Assassin's Creed's combat seem decent. 5. Lack of non-lethal gameplay. The only way you can deal with an enemy is by killing them loudly or quietly. 6. You're forced to search every inch of the map for random coins and if you don't get every single one, you don't get to have abilites that make the game less tedious. 7. There's a limit of around two of each item that you can carry. Want to have more than 2 of a disposable weapon or health potion? Too bad. 8. The darkness does not work at all. The enemies can easily see you which makes hiding in the dark quite useless. If you're hiding in the dark and just to happen to be in the 180 degree FOV of the AI, you're going to be instantly spotted and killed without warning. 9. Those roaby bugs. In an extremely tedious stealth game where you have to kill everyone, the developers thought it would be best to include a completely random creature in the game to annoy players even more. Regardless of the fact that they don't fit anywhere at all in the main story. 10. The special vision. It's literally worse than any other magical vision in other games. It serves literally no purpose other than as an abitrary requirement to navigate through the poorly designed maps. Poor lighting with poor controls which need to be fixed with a 'special ability' does not make a good game. 11. The clone. It also serves no purpose other than to solve trivial problems created by the developers for the sole reason of giving the clone a use in the game. 12. You can't look up or down. This isn't a joke, your body is blocking your view down and you can't move the camera up to see above you.  If you're looking for a decent stealth game instead, i suggest you try out Dishonored.",

It's just inconstant and opaque mechanic - I know developers patched controls, but they are still clunky. it's hard hang down from a ledge as well as grab a ledge after a jump sometimes. - there are giant glowing bugs that are blind but can hear you, and will attack you if you are close, but for some reason they do not attack guards. and I've seen a dead guard's body surrounded by them, so it's not like they are pet bugs or something.

I laid down 7 bucks during a sale for it and booted it up.  Graphically it isn't bad. It's stylized like the Fable series in a way, but slightly less elegant; it has a more gritty look. I have a couple of frame drop issues (mainly when I look outside) but that is more than likely due to my laptop's strength. There are a few clipping problems, especially with the dagger when Styx is pressed against a wall and the camera can clip into the walls as well if you manuever it during Styx's wall-hugging. Lip syncing with Styx is on spot for the most point, but then the humans... well. Honestly it's bad. It isn't Godzilla dub-over bad, but it is definitely noticeable.   The game opens with a cut scene trying to immerse you in the world and it fails rather badly. They go on and on about this amber and the Heart of the Tree and how it's an infinite source of power but never mention for what. Magic, ostensibly? Or is it also used as currency? Styx is captured right away and interrogated... well. He isn't really pressed for info. He just spills the beans, really, which I found odd. He is speaking to some Lord that has barely any conext for you to care about and then you're thrust into a... memory? Or is he telling the story of how he got there? It's VERY unclear. Whatever, the game can still be great even if I don't like/care about the story.  I hope you enjoy (poorly written and hammy) dialouge because Styx never EVER shuts his f****** mouth. To make things worse, his voice actor is awful. This may just be me, but I honestly find his voice grating. He tries so hard to add depth and cynicsm to Styx by emphasizing his curses but it just gets obnoxious, like a middle schooler trying to be edgy. Not good. At all. And when I say he never shuts up, I mean it. The developers decided to shove EVERYTHING down your throat by having Styx say it to himself repeatedly and it really kills the immersion and any chance you have to like the character. Oh, and Styx also will never stop whining about his headache, either. We get it, game. His head hurts because of the tree or something; wee.  The controls aren't bad, though there is some weirdness with movement (I guess this has more to do with the character model floating over edges, I suppose). I finally get Styx's dagger, which apparently is super cool and foreign according to some guards, but it's seriously just a knife. That's it. So you get the knife and the game shows you how to silently kill. You sit there, holding down a button till you can muster the strength to kill him, fine. Standard stealth game fare. Then they thrust you into a combat situation... and this is where I felt like an idiot for buying this. It's a bunch of quick time events. It is beyond bad. It's stupid, it's tedious, it's slow and everytime you get into open combat you sigh out loud; not because you've been caught, but because the combat system is absolute garbage. If everything else with this game was golden and this combat system was still used I would pan the game just for that. It's seriously that bad.   THEN there is unlocking doors. Instead of having some sort of skill based mini-game or something more creative, the game has you stand there and hold a button while Styx shoves his finger in the lock and looks around like he's having a siezure. It's stupid, it's boring, and it adds nothing to the game. Take it out. Bad, developers. Bad. No treat for you.   Lastly, and this may be just me, the fall damage seems VERY liberal. I understand having fall damage in the game, it makes sense. But this acrobatic little gobbo would die if he fell off your back porch, it seems.  Overall, Styx could've been cool. I'll finish it and pray to Posiedon it gets better, but there are SO many things fighting against it. I don't know if I can grit my teeth through anymore unlocking sequences or 'combat' QTE's. If you still want to play the game I encourage you to wait for it to go on sale for less than 10 or 8 bucks.",

Like its not working properly.  -Doors are painfully long to open even if there is nothing special on the other side.  -Kills (even loud ones) take upwards of a million years, and if you try to do a silent kill you are better off trying to avoid enemies entirely, because either you kill yourself with how long it takes to ram a knife into a dudes head and then hold his mouth closed for 7 seconds after he died, or you get caught out and destroyed by the 4 gaurds that have seen you mid way through the eternity.  And lets say you do get caught, and you kill one guy, even after the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parry fighting mechanic you finally get the kill, in which a 5 second animation of you killing the dude happens, just enough time for the 3 dudes on the other side of the map to hear you, track you down and kill you.  When I finally found a way to cheese the game (cling to a wall, whistle with X (which was never explained) and conceal kill enemies that try looking for you), it was horrible because the enemies more than less would be bugging into eachother trying to get through the door.  And oh boy if even 1 guy is on you, you are screwed, becase thier throwing daggers are absolutely aimbot, take about 3 or 4 to kill you and are infinate (but if you kill them nobody is carrying throwing daggers).  Sure maybe upgrades would have helped, but I still have no idea how to get the SP for it, and I didnt find any of them useful enough to make me powerful enough to have any fun. Give the game a 4/10, looked decent and thats about it.",

All of my other games, Steam and non-Steam alike work. But Styx: Master of Shadows woudln't launch.  Several people are/were in my case; some of them did manage to make the game launch by restoring their computer while some had their games working fine until they restored their computer.   In other words, you may or may not be able to run Styx according to a random factor, even if you have a gamer PC or not, a custom-built one or not and so on. It's pure randomness.  And where are the devs?   NOWHERE  . They tried to fix this issue at first, and when they couldn't understand where the problem was coming from they just   STOPPED   answering our questions and pleas to know if they were working on a solution. They were (and still are) ignoring people whose money went into their game. And I find this UNACCEPTABLE. I myself had   NONE   answer from the Focus team and I tried to get some for ONE MONTH. I spent ONE MONTH returning each and every day on the forum to see if the devs finally said something. The only help I had (and most helpful too) was from fellow players who had this problem. And while it is great that some of them managed to fix their game, it's not the role of the customer to fix their game.  Now, there are two types of Styx owners: the ones who still hope there will be a solution and the ones like myself who were fed up to be taken for fools and asked for a refund.   In a nutshell, don't buy this game. You may not be able to run it and if it's the case, you   won't   have any help from the devs.",

The maps are very well designed and they never look similar to each other, it seems like the developers didn't used the most liked copy+paste-method. The story is very interesting and lets you evolve together with the main character. Styx is very characteristic and he just acts like a special Goblin would.   The gameplay is just like I want it. You CAN do what you WANT to. That means that you can actually go through a level with your own style to pass it: Sneaky and silent, so silent that nobody has ever seen you. Or aggressive and loud, spreading many corpses around. Or at least, my style: Deadly, but silent. Nobody will ever find a dead body lying around, nor hear an alert.  As you see: The game lets YOU decide on how you wanna pass the level, and this makes the game so free. It's not linear because there are sooo many ways to go through levels, with secret courses and tricks. Btw. you can also mock the guards with your clone c:  The only contra here is: There are no mouth synchronizations (in my game), but really, that is nothing compared to the pro's. (EDIT: it seems to work partly now. Also finally I wish I could play with Rakash because hes cool)   So in the end: Styx, Master of Shadows is a game, that makes alot of fun (especially for Goblin and stealth-game fans) and I would REALLY recommend you to buy it, if you already thought about gettin' the game.

Styx is not like (the new) Sam Fisher who upon being discovered just flips a table and clears the map with machinegun fire. Far from that! He's a puny goblin who will get his butt kicked and head caved in if you don't play the game to his strengths.  The maps are all very well designed... with one glaring issue however. You are going to see them all at least twice as you start playing all the maps in reverse from chapter 4 and onwards. On the upside the maps are well designed and still work well even played in reverse.   The good:  Expansive levels with a lot of verticality that rarely make you feel like you're being forcibly shoehorned into a predetermined path and if there is one you can easely break out of it by creative use of your clone or invisibility. Chatty (and funny) main character. Minimal handholding. Even silent kills cause some noise so there are no scenes common in many stealth games where entire formations of densly packed troops are silently murdered without them even realizing as long as noone looks directly at the Grave Walker.   The bad:  The guards occasionally stop patrolig upon loading a saved state and just stand in place. The maps are all played twice... and one even thrice. The map is useless not only not showing the main characters position but also showing a pretty small fragment of the actual map due to all the verticality and the map being drawn from a top down perspective. On some maps that's almost like not showing over half of the level. The combat is laugable and best completely avoided.",

The atmosphere somewhat reminds me of the Overlord game series, sort of cartoony visuals and goofy voice acting.   It's got a single linear storyline, so this might dissapoint players who are used to games like Mass Effect where player decisions influence the plot. However, levels can be be completed in a multitude of ways. After a level has been completed once, it can be replayed as many times as the player desires, so there's a ton of replay value here.   Combat is no fun in this game, but it's a stealth game, so I don't think it's fair to knock on it for that reason; it can be played as a pure stealth game with zero killing if one so desires. Players are rewarded skill points by completing main and side objectives, as well as level achievements. Like a very simplified RPG, the player can use skill points to populate skill trees and upgrade or acquire additional abilities. Some examples of Styx abilities include, temporary invisiblilty, clone creation, smoke bombs, throwing knives, et cetera.  Overall, this game is a somewhat refreshing, but standard, contribution to the stealth game world. I've encountered minor bugs, but none that would actually turn me away. So, if you like stealth games and had a lot of fun with the Overlord series, check out Styx: Master of Shadows.",

            "review_text": "To quickly summarize this game: it's mediocre, its description is misleading and the pormotional material doesn't show screenshots from the product you get, but rather some special build with superior level of detail.  First, the looks. Styx looks like something launched in 2007/2008. My GTX 780 doesn't break a sweat in it and rightfully so, because textures are blurry when you get near them, level details are horribly low polygon and there's no dynamic lightning (in a stealth game!).  The sound. Music is forgetable. All voices are generic and don't sound convincing. NPCs have 2 lines of dialogue maximum, which gets old quickly. Ambient sounds are OK, apart from the shattering of chandeliers and crates - they are very, very quiet and doesn't even sound right.  The story and the writing. First is dull and generic, the second is 3rd grade at best. It's your typical case of 'OMG I'm here and I have amnesia, now some 'bad guys' are interrogating me, better tell them my story word for word, even though it doesn't benefit me or my goals!' So you're reliving the past and there's not even a touch of subtlety to that, e.g. when you load from a failed state Styx doesn't say: 'Hold on, that's not how it happened. Let me re-tell this part.' Main character in Sacrifice did that and it worked perfectly. But devs of Styx have no idea of proper storytelling.  The stealth is lackluster. Basic elements: loud fast kills, muffled long kills, silent kills from afar, putting out lights (only one type of torch can be put out), hiding bodies in chests or closets. What's ridiculous is that a wardrobe that can clearly hold two bodies or one body and Styx gets filled after putting one corpse inside. Oh and you can't knock people out, so you either kill or evade them.  The only interesting new mechanic is the clone. Basically tou hide the main character in a safe spot and summon a copy of yourself that you can use as a distraction or to clear the area from enemies and lights for you. The clone doesn't have any special abilities, apart from pushing through tight spaces. Styx can't fit there, despite being the exactly same size as the clone. What. The. Hell.  The movement. You can jump, roll, climb on some ledges and hooks, fit under furniture and stick to cover. You can't: go round the corner of a ledge while you're hanging from it; quickly move from cover to cover, you may only go around the corner of the cover; you can't climb ropes, chains or other obviously climbable vertical elements, Jumping is also very, very clunky. You can adjust your trajectory while in the air, but it feels out of place and uncanny.  The unlockable skills. Obviously there are some, because a game published after 2010 simply must have those! These are not even sorted into a tree and it's very easy to distinguish betwee the useful ones and the fillers. Taking two or three abilities that make Styx completely silent when he moves is enough to change game's difficulty from mediocre (while playing on the highest difficulty level) to easy-breezy.  Overall, Styx is a genreic game that fulfils the bare minimum for a modern stealth title. If you're a hardcore fan of the genre, skip this one, as there is better stuff on the market for the same price, even on sale.",

Combat will almost certainly get you killed unless you get a lucky parry and manage to book it and hide, and certain parts of the game actually give you a game over if you are noticed at all.

            "review_text": "This game is a 12 out of 10 game. Minus 2-2.5 points for being frustrating as hell for B.S. reasons.  This game is now one of my favorite games of all time. There are clear tributes to Thief: The Dark Project. The sneaking is very unique and gives you a real feeling of vulnerability. You never become powerful but you do learn to be smarter and exploit situations--one of the best gameplay mechanics Thief 1/2 offered.   + The story simply cannot be understated. &lt;---- This is one of the best stories I've seen in 20+ years of gaming.  + ~20 hours of gameplay. Long enough to enjoy, short enough to get on with your life.  + Replay past levels to gain more experience for upgrades. Replay a level without being seen, unlock that perk. Some of the early levels are much more fun to play once you understand the mechanics.  + The game crashed MAYBE once the entire play though. Unlike Skyrim which numbered in the dozens.  = Soundtrack teeters between really notable, and 'too notable' and repetitively annoying.   = Sidenote: The 'world hub' music sounds very much like a Bango and Kazooie song which almost brings you out of the atmosphere but it's not really a negative.  = For a 2014 game, it just BARELY runs fluidly on a GTX 560 and an Athlon X4 630 in 1080p. So plan accordingly. I had to lower the shadows and turn off motion blur. Time to upgrade, eh?  Now to the bad:  - The game mechanics are extremely frustrating. About 3 hours in you'll start feeling like you're getting the hang of it. But through the ENTIRE GAME the game will MISS a single button press and you'll be spotted. Being spotted means you have to reload. You will now enjoy 20 seconds of loading time.   - Bugs including the helper text being on screen for about 2 seconds--not enough to actually read how to defeat a new enemy.  - PRAY TO GOD you remember to use saves outside of quick save because the game is BUGGED AS HELL when it comes to reloading. People who are walking won't remember what they were doing. Your character will sometimes WARP to a place higher than he was, or further out, and BE IMMEDIATELY SPOTTED. Enjoy another 3-5 minutes of spamming quick load and trying within 500 milliseconds to press the right buttons to get out of a volatile situation the game forced you into. And it almost always means you die, or the run (Sneak Insignia = Not being seen) is a bust. I have 22 hours on record but the game shows me around 10. That means I spent ~12 hours freaking reloading and pulling my hair out.  - Missions are FOUR ZONES each and there's no way to go backwards. So if you miss something, tough luck till you can replay the mission again.  - The last few levels jump incredibly in difficulty. Even though you've unlocked powers, they don't help much at all. You end up reloading over and over until you find the one specific route the developers wanted you to take. Normally there's plenty of extra routes but certain areas tunnel you into a rage.  - The game will be so frustrating sometimes you'll feel you're trudging / grinding just so you can get to the good parts.  = Speaking of upgrades, it's a 50/50. Upgrades too powerful make the game boring. Upgrades too weak mean there's no point in unlocking them. This game is too close to the 'too weak' side, but it's not way overboard. Feeling vulnerable is important    So there are many flaws but the story is so good it just pulls you in. And when you keep getting screwed by that one guard alerting you, there's a real pleasure that comes from snuffing him out.",

I did enjoy my time with it a great deal for the following reason: levels are huge and well designed, filled with opportunities for exploration and alternate paths, and enemy placement that requires a lot of thinking to get through. This is where a stealth game must make its stand and it's where Styx shines. For that alone, stealth fans should give it a chance. Also, mechanics are well implemented, with enough variation in your tools to keep things interesting, and side missions and collectibles add to the fact that you'll spend a lot of time on each level. Thankfully, this one also has quicksaves.  Yes, you'll go through each level twice in the campaign. However, you'll start in different points and face different enemies the second time around, so the levels won't feel the same, which is a testament to the quality of its design.  In the end, even considering its flaws (which can mostly be blamed on the fact that this is a budget title), I spent nearly 40 hours completing Styx (side missions and collectibles included) and enjoyed my time with it.

You will like this if you are a stealth fan. You will like it even more if you are a goblin fan! This game made me love the greenskins even more than I already did &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3  The stealth elements are fun, which is good, because this is a stealth game and you gotta stealth through this. There is no option to get into a brawl with a dozen guards if you stealth-fail and a guard spots you and raises the alarm. There are multiple options to get around guards and situations, and if you're ballsy enough, you can do it no problem. As you go along and increase your stats, it gets easier, especially when you acquire the level on the stealth tree that allows you to be invisible indefinitely while remaining still.  The gameplay is all well and good, but I really enjoyed the STORY. Without spoiling anything, this just gets BETTER several times as ♥♥♥♥ goes down. There was one part in the game where I had to stop and take a breather because everything I thought I knew was just turned around. I had a feeling it was coming, but the way it was handled was SO MUCH BETTER than I could have hoped. The story goes on and it gets better until the end, whcih is very satisfying.  Now, because this is stealth, you may expect to spend a lot of time pressed up against walls and peeking around corners, waiting to pick out the guard's patrol pattern and identify any exploitable spots. You will also be saving and re-loading often for when that bloody guard notices you creeping about and raises the alarm (thus, killing your chance of a perfect no-detection run). This translates into many, many hours spent staring at Styx in all his green glory hanging off ♥♥♥♥ and peeking around things. After hours of gameplay, a couple elements began to stick out. Not necessarily BOTHERING me, but... well, after 80+ hours, I began to notice: - character designs get repetitive (not a big complaint, but just very noticeable when average guard #324 looks just like the smugglers I dealt with, and that guard in the prison, and the three guards in the distillery, and that prisoner, etc.) - overheard guard comments/conversations get repetitive. Aside from some brilliantly unique dialogue I could eavesdrop on, including people puzzling over what kind of creature I am, as I went, I eventually heard some librarians discussing how to classify me, and one suggested I should be a goblin (AWESOME!), it got tiring to hear so many different guards talking about the same things. How many snuffboxes were lost in a game of cards?? - killed bodies violently flop and fly about after I kill them but before I can pick them up. Unhelpful if I'm trying to do this lickety-split before his buddy sees me. Flopping out of my reach and into a live guard's line of sight is unhelpful, dead body. - dead bodies' interactions with solid objects is hit and miss. some bodies' heads disappeared into the walls they slumped against, other bodies fell through floors to land on the levels below (thus, hindering my attempts at a no-bodies discovered playthrough.  These are minor quibbles, which only really became big because I plugged so much of my life into playing this. Really, though, this game is super-satisfying and you just might enjoy it, too!",

If you get detected and then a guard catches you, you'll get locked into a duel mode where you have to parry his attacks and wait for a moment to strike. The issue is that you can't break out of this mode and it's likely that you'll have other enemies attack you and kill you while this is happening. Assassin's Creed this ain't. However, this can be circumvented by playing on Goblin difficulty, which makes every attack from an enemy a one-hit kill and turns off the duels.  I've seen some people complain about the jumping and climbing mechanics, but I personally didn't have any difficulties with the platforming sections. Styx feels a little floaty with his jumps, but it wasn't too hard to get a hang of.  The biggest issue would be the last and only boss fight in the game. You're trapped in a small circular room with two waves of three enemies and almost no cover. I must have died ten times before I went back several saves so I could go into the arena better prepared with a full stock of amber and throwing knives.   Apart from that, Styx is a solid hardcore stealth game. Set traps, stealth kill guards, hide bodies, sneak under tables, across rafters, through vents, and avoid detection at all costs. It's nothing groundbreaking, but if you're someone with a taste for games like Thief or Mark of the Ninja, there's a good chance you'll enjoy Styx.",

On a technical side the game's asthetic is beautiful with sprawling levels and good use of colors to present a visually varied setting.

Also down on the dpad to whistle.  The story was fine, but I felt it was confusing. I wasn't exactly sure what was going on after the transition between the opening cut scene and gameplay - it becomes more apparent as you progress through the game whats going on, but even the ending left me scratching my head about what happened.  The levels look great, the outdoor / city levels in particular are amazing. I found myself trying to get to a good vantage point just to look at the cityscape and backgrounds. The levels are also huge and open which added to the atmosphere, you really get a sense that the world is layers upon layers of huge, even the sewers/underground levels are huge.  The level design itself is good and while there is usually a path of least resistance, there are enough different paths to take that it feels very open.  The stealth gameplay was good, although I feel the enemies were a bit generic. I can't fault the game too much for that though since the whole point is to avoid them.  The AI was buggy at times, sometimes an NPC would not move but after reloading a save, they would act normal.  The NPCs vision was iffy as well, sometimes they would see me immediately in a dark corner from across the room while other times I would be running jumping and rolling in a half lit room and only get a 'Huh?' warning.  You will usually die quickly, or instantly, if you get discovered which is fine for this style game, but I have a problem with the logic of the 'blind' bugs. you can get within a few inches of their face and they won't see you, but once you are discovered by them, they can shoot you from across the room with pinpoint accuracy.  The tutorial level did a good job of teaching the games mechanics, but left out an important feature which I had wanted early on but didn't discover until the final mission: down on the dpad to whistle and get guards attention. I had been using the clones to do this but the effectiveness was very hit or miss. The controller controls were very straight forward so I had no reason to look them up in the options.  There are a number of little things worth mentioning that I appreciate from the developers:  The brightness option actually increases the ambient lighting in the level rather than using a TV style brightness that turns blacks grey. My one complaint is that the default was too dark and increasing the option by 1 made it too bright and so it would be nice to have that option be more granular to get it just right.  The overall responsiveness off the game was great.  Nice 3d background on the menu screen with no noticeable loading time.",

The stealth system it's inconsistent, enemies sometimes will see you for whatever reason, the A.I it's ordinary. The ledge detection it works as it should in platformer but ocasionally Styx will miss the point where he is supposed to grab, and you can't turn around corners while hanging on ledges.

But as i said while it has issues Styx it's still a breath of fresh air in the current market, it's always great to kill an enemy with a throwing knife, to execute them with a well timed aerial kill, to poison them with your vomit, to drop on them a giant chandelier, to control your goblin and send him to bind a guard so you can kill him viciously.

Pass.”   For once not listening to my finer judgments turned out for the better. This game is awesome, and I was stupid to dismiss it at first.   I really like platformer games (like Mario) and stealth games (like Thief), and Styx weds both genres fairly well. I also really like dark, steam punk worlds and this is a good one. Finally, the story was pretty unique, and the protagonist really grew on me.  I have 2 chief complaints: the first is that when you jump to a ledge, Styx automatically climbs up it UNLESS you are pressing the jump button. This is clumsy and unintuitive; he should naturally hang, and then jump up when you push the jump button. I swear dropping off a ledge was sometimes the hardest part of the game.  The second was a lack of a first person mode that you could use to look straight up or down. Would have been helpful at times.",

There is some SKill/Magic system added to it. Which is a nice addition and adds some depth, options and diversity in playstyles.  Nowhere near Dishonored-level, but still.... Story is nice, voice acting is ok, graphics are actually pretty good (Its a stealth game so it tends to be dark quite often!), Good, not too silly humour.  Even counting, that this is a relatively small budget game by a small developer, there are some problems. The biggest by a mile: The 2nd half of the game recycles almost completely the locations and areas of the first half. with no changes to their designs. That feels VERY cheap, demotivating - and budget or not, is simply bad/lazy game design. And while the ... unusual tower looks amazing at times, all levels are in there, so diversity isnt great in the fist place.. Also the levels are, compared with thief 1-3, a bit on the linear side. (Not as much as Splinter Cell or the last so-called Thief though).    I'd empathise the problems a bit more, were it a full price game, but with its low price in sales and very little real alternatives, its more or less a must buy for classic stealth game fans with reasonable expectations.",

The writing isn't exactly ....perfect  But the reason for why there are positive reviews is that the gameplay is pretty good. It's pretty satisying. I like playing stealth games so this is pretty good in my book (uninterntial rhyme there). If you don't like stealth games then don't ever bother playing this game.  Also they're making a sequel. I'd buy it.......( for 10 bucks)",
