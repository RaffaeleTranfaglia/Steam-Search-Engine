(i miss master of magic on steam:P)  (moo1 is a dos based game. on steam it starts with dosbox as emulator. in case of problems configfile is easy to edit. you know the deal -&gt;your responsibility only:P. looks like the orginal manual with techtree! is in the gamedirectory too )",

I still come back to this game from time to time for nastalgia. It may not look like much, but many core mechanincs used in modern turn based strategy games can be traced back here. I maintaned an old DOS machine after the release of Windows XP just for this game I enjoyed it so much. Simple by todays standards, but still fun.",
