The gameplay rules are pretty much the same as the first DoW, and as the title says, you are always facing down winter in the different snow capped battlefields you fight on. Players who want to know the full story of the DoW series in order should play this after they play the original DoW, because what happens in this version connects with other games in the DoW series (not telling which one, you have to find out yourself!). Good game.",

However, i had a tough time with the campaigns, mainly the 'order' campaign. There are small bugs here and there, but nothing that will ruin your game experience. If you're a fan of the Warhammer 40K franchise and looking for a fun, yet challenging story, this game is for you.",

The campaign is just... bad - The split story is not only bad, but the overall plot definitely feels thrown together. I know they were going for 'play thing other than spess mahrines!' but common.... 2. Everything this does, the other expansions do way better - The Necron expansion is probably the best of the three, but you can basically skip this xpac 3. Its short - Like.... way short. I think I finished this xpac in a couple hours playing Chaos, but hated it so much I didn't even try with the Imp Guard.  This is coming from a 40k fan.... I love 40k, and while the tabletop was ruined by 6th and overpriced models (personal opinion) I still love the setting and story, so will continue to support it with the games. That said, this Xpac is definitely not worth your time if you have the GOTY edition; skip ahead to soulstorm or the other one, your not missing much here.",

You can play as Order (Imperial Guard and Eldar) or Disorder (Orcs and Chaos).  Order campaign has a bunch of sections where you control an Imperial Guard base. I personally hate Imperial Guard. They seem really underpowered and weak. And the Eldar parts are basically hero missions.   Disorder campaign has a really annoying 3rd mission.  Both campaigns are essentially the same story/content wise with only some differences which I mentioned. Both sides have a really confusing 4th mission where you have to switch back and forth between the two races. The transition is very choppy and annoying.",
