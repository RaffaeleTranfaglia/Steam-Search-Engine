            "review_text": "One of the three Apeiron games, famous with their game engine, made exactly for squad-based tactical wargames simulations. Recently it was updated with Hard Life community mod, which optimised some of game's features and edged to maximum its strong and weak sides.  In short, I can suggest and propose that game only to quite small cohort of true fans of tactical squad-based games a-la 'Jagged Alliance'. In fact, community-upgraded versions of 7.62 and Brigade E5, another Apeiron game, are probably the most capable successors and inheritors of Jagged Alliance good fortune (along with just a few more titles, like Silent Storm and some more).  So. You take the command over small group of mercenaries, merged into another domestic war in small 3rd-world country. You manage guns , tons of them, equip vests, scopes and other tacticool little things which make you a bit more ready-for-anything... And you constantly engaging in some fierce shootouts, where you need to use all your tactical skills and the best of luck, to stay alive for another day. Fight, collect trophies, rest, find a new quest for your squad, get to the new location, goto 10 - the golden formula from Jagged Alliance. If you're still reading, guess you already know all that drill.  Now, what's the special about Apeiron engine and game in general? First, it is NOT turn-based, it is using smart-pause real-time pattern instead. You could have seen that in the recent 'remake' Jagged Alliance: Back in Action, but trust me, it was only spoiled there. Apeiron created, up to the moment, the most complicated and advanced engine to perform a gunfight between small squads. Ballistics, lines of sights, variable reliefs and layouts, combat interferences, contusions - just name it - it is there.  Second, if we don't speak about engine, but overall game's features instead - sadly, it is weak, at best. Lame scenario, questionable and obscure quests and so on. If you're coming to the game not just for refined tactical simulation, that's not the right project. I can suggest to look for the next Apeiron game, Marauder, as there will be at least some of plot, narrative motivation and other things we're usually expecting from the complete game, as of the any piece of art.  As of conclusion, 7.62 is a niche product, connoisseurs of the tactical combats only. The gameplay is about tune your gear, shoot some folks, rince and repeat. Guns-adorers would find many satysfaction there, with all charts, graphs for hundreds of various tools of death. Normal players, who are not ready to shift all those irons hours after hours and then perform one battle, about 2-3 minutes of 'clear' time, in another dozen of hours, with every second micromanagement fixes, saves and reloads... Normal players will be either bored from the first look, or drained and exhausted, when with all time needed to finish another Call-of-Duty project, they only (probably) manage to clear the first village there...  As of my mark, usually I'm not high about projects where so many gameplay parts are obviously ill-performed. But, with 7.62, with all community support... It is worth my 8/10 mark, as I'm really like squad-based tactics and guns, and this is one the best on given patterns.",

With community mods, they turn this game into one of the best games one could want to play. A definite must if you actual enjoy being frustrated by a game which is fairly 'Realistic'. Try several complex strategies, fail. Go gung-ho and start throwing grenades and hip shooting everything and succeed. Get even more frustrated.",

Positives:  - A LOT of guns, seriously tons of different guns, different ammunition and even different mags, - Innovative mechanics whe your accurac depends on your stress level - Challenging, On higher levels random encounters are really almost impossible - Character development is well thought. You really see that levelling up makes sense Negatives: - Glitchy. Sometimes you will be shot through walls, sometimes granade explodes in a bit peculiar way, - Music or maybe the lack of music (I think, there is music but it is boring and repetetive) - Mechanics is not explained and given it's a Russian game (I think) sometimes its quite hard to get a good explanation what exactly this or that parameter does, - Plot is only okeish: it's neither bad nor surprising   Summary: 7-8/10",

            "review_text": "This is the sequel to the interesting Brigade E5: New Jagged Union. In the same vein as that title, it is a real-time with pause tactical shooter much like the newer Jagged Alliance titles such as Jagged Alliance: Back in Action and Jagged Alliance: Crossfire. I haven't played as much of this one because it seems like it's actually more buggy than the earlier one; it runs fine on my gaming PC but on my laptop, if I change a single setting and restart as the game prompts me to, the resolution bugs out in the menu, leaving the game unplayable without a full uninstall. Beyond that bug, it seems a little less deep than Brigade E5 in terms of gameplay, but that might just be my initial impressions in about half an hour of gameplay. Overall a fair title in an under-represented genre.",
