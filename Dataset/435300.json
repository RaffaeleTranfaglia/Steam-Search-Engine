            "review_text": "Listen: We know the devil is an exercise in transcendence. Every line of dialogue sings. Every description shines. Every moment of comfort or explosion of anguish is captivating in it's visceral feeling--the characters are named after planets for good reason. Each is a world unto themselves, and the depth of feeling that their interactions convey move like storms and hurricanes and gamma flares--all the force of the universe condensed to three hearts.   I know I sound ridiculous here--hyperbolic to the point of insanity. But there's nothing else I can say. To say that the writing sounds like if you knitted a quilt of Stephen King descriptions with magical girl tropes does a disservice to We Know the Devil--if only because King couldn't write an LGBT character well if his life depended on it.   This game plucked me from the lofty self-security and happiness of adulthood and tore me all the way down to when I was a scared little boy, staying up at night watching for night terrors that I feared less than I feared the knowing light of God.   It reminded me what it's like to be small, to be brittle, to feel like you've got poison in your veins that you can't escape. To be sick to death of your life and your family and your religion and teachers and 'friends', and most of all of yourself. It set me on fire with creative energy like I've never really felt before. It made me realize that all my joy and my love for people is useless, worthless, if I don't do something with it.   It was a wake-up call to the fact that I need to do more to try and help the lonely kids that are still out there--the ones so much like who I used to be.   If you've ever even wondered if you were queer, play this. If you've ever felt so much as a minor tick of annoyance at the System telling you What You Should Do, play this. If you've ever felt regret after hurting someone you realized you could have loved, play this.  And if none of that applies to you, play it anyway, and do so with an open heart. I guarantee this will teach you more about what it's like to be queer--or hell, even just an unhappy teenager--than a million essays or documentaries or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hollywood movies could teach you.   If I have anything like criticism for this game, there's only two nitpicks:  1) The visual glitches when you fast foward can be weird and distracting. They always fixed themselves before I reached a new scene, but I could really see them hurting someone's experience if they got unlucky. I hope they fix them later.  2) Occasional typos and what seem like misused grammar at a few points are stutters in what is otherwise one of the best written works I've ever experienced. Frankly, I wish I could offer my volunteer services to just suggest edits for all of those things myself, I'd be only too happy. Most other fiction, I could just brush right by it--but with writing this good, all the small details that don't add up hit me like a screeching chalkboard.   Regardless, don't let either of those dissuade you. It's so, so worth it. Please know the devil, she's so ♥♥♥♥ing great.",

            "review_text": " We Know The Devil  is an interesting, somewhat surreal and delightfully strange visual novel. The dialogue is thought-provoking (and often quite funny) and feels natural. I loved the characters, especially Venus who reminds me waaaay too much of myself as a teenager. A lot of their comments hit close to home for me.   If you're in the mood to try something a little different, or you enjoy more non-traditional visual novels, you should give this game a shot.   PS: The  soundtrack  [aleclambert.bandcamp.com]  is also really cool.",

            "review_text": "Foreword: Don't make the same mistake I did; don't devour the game, savor it. It belongs to the kind of experiences that only reach their full emotional potency when experienced for the first time.  I am not writing this review to tell you about the gameplay, for there is none. There are 'choices', but for the sake of the experience you will be seeing every one of them. Talking about mechanincs is null.    Come in blind   - This game is, when properly read and reflected upon, quite a powerful piece of literature. And I say literature because this really is just reading, but in a pretty format. On the surface the narrative is about being the one left out, being the odd one. However this premise is only what drives the story to make its point. Everyone  is  the odd one out. What lies within and rears its head as you explore the multiple alternatives the game presents you, is what it really means to tell you. Its about the self, and the form the world forces it to adapt to. Its three mirrors juxtaposed, and you must break them one by one in order to find your own reflection.",

I wasn't sure if I liked it while I was playing it through the first time, and very much didn't like it the second time through. But somewhere in my third playthrough, I kind of started to appreciate it.  It was the next day that I realized that there was something about the storytelling that had infiltrated me and intrigued me, stealth-style. It crept up on me, and made me think about my sleepaway camp days, and some of the things a writer can do to evoke emotion. A month later, now that it's had time to set, I appreciate how the game at times tries to bewilder in order to shock emotion into you.  I think if you like interesting narrative experiments, this quick whiff of emotion might be up your alley. And even if you find it frustrating at first, it may yet end up part of your emotional lexicon.",

            "review_text": "The best way to play and experience We Know the Devil is to go into it knowing as little about it as possible, so I'll try to keep this brief. We Know the Devil is a game that wants to talk about those moments in life when we're in the company of others, and how those times are affected by who you are and what you bring to the proverbial table. It's a game that takes itself seriously, and as such it isn't afraid to make you laugh every now and then while also tugging at your heartstrings with some mastefully presented ideas. But the beauty of the game is that these ideas are often unspoken. Silence, glances, and subtext carry a lot of weight, and that means sometimes you might not 'get' something. And that's okay. We Know the Devil isn't about 'getting' everything, it's about 'getting' yourself. It's a game about realizing that no matter how messed up you are, or how messed up the world is, you deserve to be happy and to love yourself. And boy, does this game do a fantastic job of getting that point across.",

            "review_text": "Oh my god. Okay, now, first off, let me iterate: I have played a lot of visual novels, and yes, they have all been gay visual novels, except for Sonic's Inflation Adventure, which I may have only played in a dream. This is probably the best visual novel / interactive story type thing I have ever played. The only ones rivalling it are the Analogue/Hate series, which is only KIND of a visual novel, and I'm not even sure if it counts.  Okay... It's almost 3 AM, so I'm organizing this really weirdly. There's elements, y'see, Story, Characters, and Gameplay.   The story is ♥♥♥♥ing great. Obviously, there were outcomes I didn't really like, but I wasn't supposed to like them, so they worked out perfectly. The TRUE ending is my absolute favorite, but all endings were very entertaining. Hellish, but in the best way possible.   The characters were pretty great too. I definitely saw real people in each of the three main characters (and saw the characters in real people). Of course, I wish some aspects of their lives were clearer and more drawn-out, but the game is vague on purpose and often avoids going into character or background details for the sake of the story. Which is fine. The reason I desire more details about the characters is because I like them so much, not because they're lacking.  Gameplay-wise, well, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing visual novel. My only gripe is that the true ending is a little annoying to get, but that's all true endings, so it's a useless gripe. There are other aspects of gameplay though, like, visuals, audio, that sort of thing. I really like the visuals. '♥♥♥♥♥♥ trash summer camp' was captured perfectly, and the quality of each image imbues just that bit of eerieness when you need it. I liked the music a lot, so much so that I wish there was more of it! But I happen to enjoy weird lo-fi + electronic crap so I don't know how it holds up with other people.  Okay, and then, themes. Obviously, disillusionment (or just plain dissatisfaction) with Christianity is a huge thing here. A little off for me, because I wasn't raised with it, but I happen to really enjoy unorthodox interpretations of witchcraft and the devil and so forth, so it really resonated with me. Probably one of the biggest themes is isolation, or being unable (or unwilling) to 'fit in,' and the game handles this extraordinarily well. And there's the queer part of it, which is pretty clear and makes it all the better since it's a game by queer artists, for queer people. Plus, what better way to be isolated than to be queer? It all sort of goes together; it wouldn't make sense for these characters to be so isolated in a camp full of their peers in terms of age and background and NOT be queer.   I can barely stay awake and it's becoming even more evident, so I'll wrap this up: It's a great game, even for people who aren't into visual novels. If you're not queer or obsessed with the devil, it probably won't resonate as much with you, but you could very easily still enjoy it.",

Saying more would be spoilers, but if you've ever been the 'weird' kid, you will find some character to attach to. I love all three of the group so much, each ending left me in tears.   Maybe not having this game yet was just fate, bc it seriously came at a perfect time. I am 19 and in my first year of college, living mostly on my own. The themes the game deals with of finding and accepting your true self are exactly the sorts of things I'm living with now.  I cannot say enough, so I will leave it here. But please, play this game.

The visuals have a distinct lo-fi aesthetic that I personally enjoyed, with B&amp;W character spites over polaroid-quality photo backgrounds. It probably won't be to everyone's taste, but the sprites are expressive and go a long way to making the characters endearing.  The music is... odd. Not bad, but definitely odd. It fits.  The writing is where the game really shines; I don't want to say too much, but it does a lot with a little, both in terms of subtly drawing the characters and making you care about them, and explicating just enough of the setting to keep the plot rolling. I'm literally angry at how good the writing is.  One last thing-- WKTD is often called a 'queer' game, and it is. You definitely don't have to be queer to 'get' it, though probably it helps. It's not a piece speaking solely to that group, though it's also not interested in making any apologies.",

(I didn't catch this one, I have no idea what her deal is.)  That's all well and good, but these kids are at one of those ♥♥♥♥ing religious camp things where they beat the gay out of you, so none of that ♥♥♥♥ is gonna' fly in this hellish camping experience.  One of my main issues with this novel is that there's a whole not that's not explained;  The characters constantly use 'radios', however they're able to wrap doornobs with them, use them as axes, pour water from them and use them as flashlights AS WELL as using them to communicate. This is never explained, addressed or acknowledged in any way, simply skipped over like we're meant to understand what the ♥♥♥♥ a radio is besides some random multi-tool.  The characters use the radio to speak to god. They even give the frequency that god broadcasts on, and then hear the devil, also using the radio. There's a grid of speakers set up around the place that alerts the characters when the devil has entered the camp... What the ♥♥♥♥ does any of that even mean?   At first I thought that this whole setup was the adults at this place tricking the kids there that god and the devil are real using radio tricks and spooky stories, then the cast would find out and do something about it, but then one of the characters literally turns into a ♥♥♥♥ing zombie.   Then there's the endings. Three of the four endings are so alike that you could swap out the character names and not notice a difference. Once you've seen one, you've seen em' all, and it's not even fun to read all the routes since the branching point for all of the routes is in the last few minutes of the novel, meaning most of your read time is going to be skipping ♥♥♥♥ you've already read.  I was hoping I'd enjoy this novel as I liked Hustle Cat, also produced by Date Night, but unfortunately it seems like it's not for me. For the $6.66 it cost me, I can't be mad that it only took me 93 minutes to finish, but I was hoping it'd be at least a pleasant 93 minutes.",

It's short, and only took me around 2 hours to complete with all endings.    Play through this completely blind. Trust me.    At 4 or 5am the soundtrack will have these screeching alarms go off. I'd suggest turning down your voume for that hour   It's not really a horror game(save for a few images towards the end), and is more a psychological horror. So, don't expect a lot of horror.   This game is easily one of my favorites just because of the characters and the way they grow and interact and experience their devils. If you have $8 to spare, play this game.",

The sound design and visuals also serve this strange game perfectly.   The play time is short, but I expect I'll be thinking about it long, long after tonight.
