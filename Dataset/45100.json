            "review_text": "i would like to say that i came into this game expecting nothing. but as i continued playing i soon realised that this game is hardcore. it has a whole lot of depth to it. the goal of the game is to make baby horses. you level up your horses' stats (yes, this is an rpg) then get them to breed with a horse of the same level to spawn a horse with an increased level. here is a detailed look at the game.  story - 10/10 grandpa found out that some magic crystals affect horses but nobody believed him. journal guys ridiculed him. so he gave some two kids a crystal each.  graphics - 10/10 even the greatest of gaming machines will struggle to run this beast of a game at the 'Fantastic' graphics setting. however older computers can still run it, as proved by my limited edition windows 97.  gameplay - 10/10 you make your horse run over some sticks and maybe even a log by pressing the arrow keys at specific times to help increase the horses' stats. sometimes your horse can get infected from jumping over too many sticks, so you have to give it a shot to heal it. you can also send your champion horse on quests such as delivering a letter to a guy in some town, or maybe even pull a cart of sticks. as you go on your quest, you can find ingredients to craft things. the game has a very complex drug crafting system. your horse can find herbs and spices as it completes quests, which you can mix together to create drugs. the drugs have no none effects at the moment, but this is an early beta, so it will be implemented soon. there is also a horseshoe crafting system. your horse can find bars of various metals lying on the ground, which he or she will pick up and store for later use. you can craft differing horseshoes from different metals. i currently have a titanium horseshoe on my front left leg, a silver on my front right, and steel horseshoes on my muscular hind legs.  overall - 11/10 this game is beyond perfect, though not for casuls. i highly recommend this game as a gift for kwanza or veterans day or maybe even easter.",

While this game was very difficult and non intuitive, a memorable journey shortly followed that heightened my perspectives forever. This isn't just a game, it's an experience. The only thing that rivals the impeccable gameplay is the fact that there are several inaccuracies that were brought to my attention over the course of the game.  The game revolves around Equus ferus caballus, otherwise known as the domestic horse. Despite the fact that members of this genus have elevated sympathetic nervous system responses, the horses depicted in the game did not fight or flight when I posed an immediate threat to them.   Additionally, the physics engine in this game is terrible and the horses are shown to defy some law that governs physical matter at any given point in time.   Overall, I do not recommend this game unless you are a horse girl or enjoy brushing horses with amorphous objects. I have a fever I'm going to bed.",

It's by far the best simulator I've ever played.  Unlike most games where you need to pick only one profession, here you can be a trainer, a doctor or you can groom your horse all day long.  The horses are very realistically designed and their facial expressions will aid you through the game even if you're stuck in one of its hard to solve puzzles.  The races are just like the real thing and you can tune your horse as much as you want, not to mention the stable you hold it in.

This game is excellent, but before you buy it, I think you should consider the fact that it requires more of your time than a hardcore MMO addiction. It can take weeks to train just one of your horses to it's maximum level, and we all know that you need a lot more than just one horse to beat this game!  You might be wondering how I am making these claims with only ~2 hours gameplay time. The truth is, I usually play this game while in Afghanistan on deployment, where I don't have an active internet connection and have to use Steam in offline mode. It's a great game to play with all my mates in the military, and it takes our mind off the horrible war that we are fighting.   I highly recommend this to everyone that wants to play the best horse breeding/training sim out there. As I mentioned, it takes up a lot of your time, but in my opinion, it is well worth it!",

The horses get tired after training and sending them on those tasks and sometimes they get sick after you send them on missions. The game has few QTEs also when making medicine for the horses and when making horseshoes. The game also has a mating system where they need to be happy and healthy. To make them happy you just need to clean any part of their body it doesnt matter which you pick.

I miss more things due to bad timing than with Level 3 horses. Not to mention, the races are difficult in themselves. It's not easy trying to control the horse with arrow keys or WASD (or both, using both at once with different keys can help somewhat) without hitting the side of the track and then going out of control and falling terribly behind. Nice game for a horse lover if they want to have fun the first part of the game and then spend hours raging at the fact they can no longer clear a freaking jump with a higher level horse past Level 2 or 3.

Your job as a 5-9 year old is to breed these space horses to make better elite space horses.   You gain money by lending your mystical non-elite or elite space horses to peasents to do their chores. Sometimes you can enter them in the king's arena for glory and money! Now of course to win in the king's arenas you have to train your mystical space horses to be the very best! Now while this task sounds easy, it is not. In order to train your horse you most slowly dance to a beat with your arrow keys. If you train too hard or long, your mystical space horse will get tired and sometimes sick. When your mystical space horses get tired you must let them sleep, but when the mystical space horses get sick you, a 5-9 year old child, must complete alchemy to cure them of their illness.   Alchemy is just 1 of 2 skills in the game you can do. The second skill is smithing. Smithing allows you to craft horseshoes, and saddles for you mystical space horses that give them bonus stats which aid in the king's arena. Alternatively you can also decorate your mystical space horse's stall with items that give them perks in the arena. Secret of the Magic Crystals also has random events, and dynamic weather. Another key feature to the game is upgrading your mystical space horse farm's buildings.   Overall Secret of the Magic Crystals is a deep complex and overall epic mysical horse breeding/training RPG sim that shouldn't be missed! 10/10 would buy and play again.",

While painfully slow you could spend maybe 30 hours getting enough level 5 horses built up to complete the content.  The mini-games and content was not enough to entertain me, but someone with lesser expectations could continue to play it and it does get slightly harder as you level up horses.   The story is one of the worst I've seen: A magic asteroid hits earth, gets a man fired and forces horses to play DDR. Sounds legit.

The gameplay consists about training your horse until it reaches max stats, do quests and races to earn money, buy more horses, breed them for higher level horse and repeat, you can also upgrade blacksmith and the barn to make better horseshoes or potions for your horse. You can't see your horse participate it only removes him from screen and show you a lame bar saying 'your horse just took 1st place' or 'your horse did a great jump' depending of the race type. Once you obtain a lv 5 horse you can do a quest for one of the 5 magic crystals but you need 5 horses, one for each making the game tedious and repetitive,train,race,quest,buy another horse,repeat,breed,sell and repeat aain. And they dare to remove a key element of the gameplay , online racing via dlc which costs almost as much as the base game, definetly not recommended.",

I still dont really get it. I think I have to max a horses stats before I can rub them together and I can only breed them once. The tutorial didnt tell me jack crap, I havent found a guide yet(correction Iseem to found one). You pretty much just jump in and wing it. Its not bad.  Get one pretty horse. Rub it on your other pretty horse to make a third one. Sell the first two, breed another one and repeat.",

            "review_text": "When I first played this game, I was unsure of myself, of what I would see within. However, the game begins with a gripping story. The game tells of a renowned Harvard zooligist, presenting his findings to his superiors. He spoke of mystical stones which would grant horses special abilities. Not believing him, he was laughed out of his position. He then gives his findings to his son/daughter and gives them the tools necessary to become the very best trainer in all of Horseland.  The gameplay is particularly gripping, and brings you all of the things you loved from Dance Dance Revolution. Once your Horse-which you may have summoned from the ice planet of Hoth, the surface of the Sun, or the depths of hell itself- masters the fine art of dancing, he can compete in competitions with other, more boring horses. This part is the most gripping, and is particularly revolutionary for an indie game. The competitions involve watching a slider move across the screen very slowly, and require no input from the player. This moves beyond anything a video game has ever done, and transcends graphics. Instead of showing the player what happened, the player is allowed to explore the depths of his imagination. As the horses gallop across the finish line, the player knows he's made an amazing purchase.  This is a game that will live on for the rest of time; the creation of this game will be the one crowning achievement in all of humanity's history. Long after the human race is extinct, this game will drift through the cosmos, telling the story of the human condition.  In conclusion: 10/10. Would play again.",

Unless you want to spend hours grinding said timers to upgrade your stable (which is insanely expensive) you have to sell your horses to make room for new, better ones. The three riding minigames are all essentially identical.   The horses look ok though. I like the idea of a fantasy stable. I can understand why people want to like this, but it's really not worth $5. Put your money elsewhere.",

However, after 2 hours of playing I found myself oddly invested in the breeding game, enjoying myself as I made my ponies do rounds in the coral, getting the best stats etc.  Pros: - A good range of horses - A nice selection of items for your horses to try - A decent breeding system - Alchemy. That's right this has alchemy. Well... Potion making.  - Easy mini games  Cons: - Anyone over the age of 12 is not the intended audience (this should be obvious) - Background music can get repetitive - Your horses will get sick a lot, and the medicine is expensive - Very little reward for activities you do  All in all I would - despite the cons, recommend this game if you wanted something to entertain yourself with while bored, or have children coming over who love horses.",

Add pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain pasta, and rinse under cold water until cool. Transfer to a large bowl. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine vegetable oil, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, sesame seeds, ginger, and pepper. Shake well. Pour sesame dressing over pasta, and toss to coat evenly. Gently mix in chicken, cilantro, and green onions.",
