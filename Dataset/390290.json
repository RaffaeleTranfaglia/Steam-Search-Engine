            "review_text": "Bulb Boy is a horror/point and click game. Bulb Boy's house is invaded by a monstrosity corrupting everything. The aim is to save his family while surviving the encounters, which are actually quite dynamic for a point'n'click. It is possible to die, but the checkpoints are very frequent so no real loss or frustration. What I found amazing was the diversity in the scenes and interactions. Everything plays differently, and it is very refreshing. Sadly, this also means that the game is quite short (2-3h).   There are some flashback sequences that are less tense and play more like a traditional point'n'click, and are a way to understand where some of the monsters come from. However I did not find them as interesting as the rest of the game, and with the relaxed music accompanying them, they took me out of the atmosphere. The games starts easy and the difficulty ramps up nicely, but I felt like the beginning of the game had more punch and the momentum is gradually lost.  Interactions are simple and easy, movements are smooth for the most part. There is a neat little idea that Bulb Boy can take his head off and either roll it on the floor, or fix it in another receptacle. This creates a lot of variety in the potential interactions that the game can offer. I just regret that some early puzzles can be solved randomly without actually knowing what is the objective yet, but this is a fairly minor concern.  Oh, and yeah, this game is very creepy and gross. Not just the monsters, Bulb Boy himself. If you want a cool and original horror game that controls nicely, its flaws are minor and should not get in your way. I already want more of that stuff from the dev team Bulbware!",

            "review_text": "I love it! It's cute, unique, the music sets the atmosphere so well. For me, I think it's more leaning to a casual point and click style since the puzzles aren't that too hard to solve (thanks to the hint mechanic), and surprisingly I don't really find it scary.   The only time I actually got scared was the jumpscare in the fridge, and when I'm about to get killed.    Overall it's a great game, it introduces new and unique mechanics and it has that charm that makes you want to keep on playing. For an indie game, I'd say this really worth it. Kudos to the devs for a job well done! My expectations were reached. :) now I just have to unlock all the achievements xD",

Charming (and creepy) characters, great graphics, smooth gameplay, good soundtrack and what a wonderful ability to tell stories and direct the story without any use of words. I am easily terrified by anything labelled horror but I was able to play through this game without bursting into tears of terror and sleeping with all the lights on. That being said, there were some tense moments. I'm also not the most able gamer and was able to navigate the more 'active' parts- which honestly gave me quite a boost. Thank you to the developers for considering your less adept audience :). The frequent autosaves at key moments contributed to the enjoyable experience, allowing one to progress, engage and explore the game (almost) fearlessly- no hair was torn out in frustration of having to start from scratch in each level. So thank you for a most enjoyable game!",

The main character, Bulb Boy, is cute and charming and seems to be innocent yet manacing at the same time. In this point 'n click adventure, you will help Bulb Boy to solve various bizarre puzzles and defeat creepy monsters in order to save his grandpa. Many puzzles are intuitive and creative but there are some that need you to look around aimlessly for interactable objects. Story and settings are quite interesting with several unexpected elements and events that make you surprised and want more. It would be better, however, if the game is satisfyingly long enough for my gaming appetite.",
