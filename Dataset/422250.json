            "review_text": "This game is terrible. It's basically Space 'Snake', except you don't get any bigger, and the only 'challenge' comes from the occasional asteroid headed in your general direction at the optimal pace of a partially disabled slug. To top that, the music behind the game (which one would hope would be interesting to make up for the lack of interesting gameplay) is repetitive, droning, and feels like the music being a Star Trek episode without the dialogue.   And on the note of the dialogue: The voice actors are at least trying, but that doesn't excuse the lack of contextual awareness the game seems to have. 'What a rough ride! I better check my circuits!' stated my character, despite it having been a very smooth and easy ride. Give this game a pass at any price. I was fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to have the game given to me.",

ShipLord is one of the better titles I have seen with an $11 pricetag. The game's store page content showcases pretty well what it is. Normally, arcade-style games like this aren't my cup of tea, but I am glad I gave it a shot.  The mix of mildly cartoonish 2D graphics with a pseudo-3D rendered enviroment is a little weird, but did not impact playability or enjoyment at all. The background environments can be really impressive, and did on one occasion distract me to the point that it caused my death.  Patience, timing. These are key elements to success when playing this game. There isn't any offensive game-play at all, so you can expect to spend most of your time dodging asteroids and enemy fire and activating any of your three defensive abilities.  There is also an upgrade and unlock system. With upgrades, you can incrementally improve your ship's various abilities to complete levels, such as increasing your shield duration or decreasing the time it takes for each ability to recharge. At the start, you only begin with your ship and no abilities at all. This made the first couple of levels a little boring to play, but things quickly ramped up in levels after that.  It seems like a bit of a big download at 8GB, at least to me. But, there are literally a TON of levels to unlock and progress through. Over all, I think this was a really fun game to play, and well worth the cash.",
