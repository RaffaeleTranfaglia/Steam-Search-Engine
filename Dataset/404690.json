            "review_text": "This is really good interactive fiction. I can heartily recommend it to any fans of the genre and horror in general. The writing is superb and the whole atmosphere is very engaging: grim and macabre but it's varied enough not to take away my desire to explore.  I liked the story, and the enviroment. The artworks are not the best, but they fit the theme and the game so perfectly, that it doesn't really matter. It does get a little repetitive a few times if you die and need to redo something, and the fights feel boring and unnecesary, but those are just minor annoyances.",

            "review_text": "It was a nice read, but its just too short. It could be finished in a half hour if it didn't reset back to the start with every loss. Resetting so far is a real loss, its hard to be engrossed when you spend a minute or two clicking through pages you had already read, some of which move at their own dramatic pace. Its something you would probably find interesting and appreciate when its free on a site, but if you plan to buy it I would wait until its a price your willing to pay for an hour or less of your time.",

            "review_text": "   It's like an ebook with choices.   The good thing is the writing, which is actually the only way you have to 'play' this ''game''. The narration will instantly immerse you in the story and what's happening in it, but it's also the only thing that you will ever appear to see. Or hear. You won't even have any sound playing in the background in any situation, so you should take care about that for yourself.  And what should characterize the gameplay by itself, which is a kind of dungeon crawler game where you're looking for the exit of it, it's what ruins part of this atmosphere, even if the game itself is very short (i've actually made all the possible choices/mistakes in around 4 hours of gameplay): there are a total of two actual turn-based battles with some monsters, where your only choice is to 'Attack' the enemy in order to beat it, survive and continue the dungeon, and you will never lose any of these two fights because, between you and me, who want to lose in a game where, if you should lose, you'd have to restart the game and re-read parts of the story you've already experienced, thus causing a forced ripetitive boring gameplay? Nobody.  Not to mention the pretty easy ways to die while solving certain puzzles and riddles, at least for who isn't paying much attention in the reading itself or for who forgot a little but vital detail in the dungeon,    or else you're likely to start over all the challenges from the beginning again.    In the end i don't feel like to pay 6€ for such game, not because it's bad or unpolished or else, just because it feels like i'm only reading or 'hearing' a great game's narrative, but without playing that game itself, and this is how empty this one makes me feel.",

            "review_text": "I legitimately enjoy the writing in this game but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is such a ♥♥♥♥ing chore to play. There's no saving, nor are there any checkpoints outside of two very arbitrary ones that can be selected at the start of the game. That means after dying you have to click through a TON of previously read text just to try a new option, and then hope that option doesn't also lead to death because if it does you're going to have to do all that ♥♥♥♥ing clicking all over again. It doesn't help that there isn't just One Place to click either since message advancement is through hyperlinked portions of current text.  This game is made in Twine, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in a game with so many deaths you'd think that at some point the creator would think 'I should really add in a save and / or text skip function, or switch to an engine that has those built in to start with.' Ren'py comes to mind, and quite frankly I see nothing that this game does that can't be done in Ren'py. It'd probably be easier to add music, or at least some sound effects, in that engine too, since as of right now there aren't any of those. There are also quite a few typos and I have no idea why because the game's script does not seem to be that large.  Overall, this game could have been good if it weren't for such amateur mechanical mistakes. Not everyone has the time or patience to respect your writing, no matter how good it is, on repeat.",

            "review_text": " This Book Is A Dungeon  is a short 'choose your own adventure game' of sorts by solo developer Nathan Meunier. It's a gruesome tale of misfortune that has a lot of subtle commentary about human nature (  See: Chapter 4  ). It's mainly text based, but there is still a fair amount of well-created pixel art which adds to the style and the nostalgia factor of the game. The writing is fantastically done, with great atmosphere, characters, and creative concepts throughout. Not only does the game do this, but keeps it going consistently from start to finish. All of this causes it to stand out as a very unique game, and the overall vibe it gave off drew me to it instantly.  In short,  This Book Is A Dungeon  is a unique game with a distinct style, gruesome storytelling, a great atmosphere, and some fantastically creative ideas. While short, it certainly boasts some replay value with its different paths. It's a great experience that only costs about as much as a sandwich, so it's recommended by me any day of the week.   Overall Score: 8/10 ",

            "review_text": "The game itself was pretty short, I only have so much time because I went through and found all the different ways to die. I wish there were achievments for that sort of thing because I forgot which ones I had already done easily with the lack of a save function before each choice. And the option to skip the into to the first dungeon or to the picture room is not quite enough to search every option. Aside from that, the writing was really good and the pixel visuals gave just enough help to create an image in your own mind as to what was happening.  Both ends of the game, the real ends and not the ones you die, were interesting and pretty sad as neither are a 'happily ever after' end but for the theme of the game it fit and I liked it.",

It was a slice of perfectly dark horror with crushing hopelessness, and I enjoy it heavily. Personally, I grabbed it on sale, so the two hours it took me to do every possible thing was worth it, but it may not be like that for everyone. Pick it up on sale if you're sketchy, but buy it normally if you're in love with the concept.",

            "review_text": "This Book is a Dungeon (TBIAD) is a game like none other.  That isn't to say that it's an excellent game; TBIAD contains a number of blemishes, but it is certainly a unique game. I would highly recommend it to someone looking for a blend of both game and literature, provided that they are willing to cope with a bit of frivolous backtracking.  TBIAD takes inspiration from classic 'choose your own adventure' books, but advances the genre by incorporating features that only a computer could. The literature contained within TBIAD is dark and atmospheric, and the entire twisted experience is supplemented by equally demented, but gorgeous pixel art. The game does not have any sound to it though, so if you're looking to amplify your descent into madness then you'll need to either put on some of your own vibes, or look for the TBIAD mixtape on Youtube which inspired the author.  TL;DR: TBIAD is a one-of-a-kind experiment that you may enjoy if you're patient and interested in exploring a grim setting through words rather than gameplay.",
