            "review_text": "  Squareface: ~~~~~~~~~    To be vertically challenged can be difficult at times (I know, I am one of them). Can you imagine being two inches tall, having a square face, a body made of paper and you being stuck in a room with a giant human? But that’s not the worst of it - there are other two-inch figurines who are running after you to shred you apart! And you thought hiding in the corner of the room was a good idea! Not in Squareface!  Squareface is a Third Person/ Action/ Adventure game where you take control of a miniature paper figurine. At the start of the game, your figurine will appear in a box laid on the floor with “ School Project” written on it. This first mission is really a nice tutorial and will explain how to interact in the game with other figures, use items and more.   Squareface has several rooms in which you will be playing. The first room is Stevo’s room, the giant human I mentioned above. If you think Stevo’s bedroom is a mess, just wait until you step into the bathroom! Oh, and be careful with the water, it does not gel very well with paper figurines! Then you will be in the kitchen and in the lounge room. There is also a boxing ring stage which will be full of interesting challenges.    Within each level, you will talk to other figurines be given tasks to accomplish; achieve them without dying or without losing a structure (if required) to win and move to the next stage. Usually, there are three tasks per mission and if you manage to complete all of them, you will be rewarded with coins which you will be able to spend on new and better weapons (melee, main and side), pets or on your character customization. Just a quick mention on pets. They are in the game to help you carry coins but can be used to attack enemies, too. I’m saving coins to buy the great Hamster - this is going to be fun!  Your figurine will lack firepower early in the game but as you progress and collect coins, you will quickly be able to upgrade your arsenal. There are plenty of weapons to buy and help you along your quest.   Gameplay-wise, the levels are really fun! There are boxes to search for goodies (ammunition, blueprints, etc) laying around the levels and use you flashlight for a faster search. In the ammunition one, you might pick up mines, water balloons (to slow down your foe) or grenades to eliminate them. They will leave a coin at the place in which they have fallen - just run over the coins to collect them. There are different type of enemies to defeat, from small (half an inch, how bad they must be feeling) to monster paper figurines. Some will have melee and others will have range weapons. Enemy towers and other giant obstacles, the likes of the mighty and smelly thongs is one of them! Hold on, I have not finished. You can drive cars and also build camps with defence towers, barracks (you will get additional figurines to fight at your side), warehouses and workshops in some missions.  I like the graphics and artworks, they are just great! The only negative is the camera, in my opinion. Every now and then the camera just goes totally weird and you need to move your mouse in a circle a few times, then the camera comes back to normal.   Positives: ~~~~~~~   - Great graphics - Plenty of weapons, enemies and pets - Well-designed levels - Cool concept and universe - Fun gameplay and character customization - Print and make your our paper figurine - Achievements and trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - This camera bug (if it is) is annoying. Needs to be fixed  8/10  Squareface really took me by surprise - great content and fun to play. Squareface has to find its way to your game library!
