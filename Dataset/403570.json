            "review_text": "Stigmat is a well-intentioned game with a large, unavoidable flaw: it thinks it is Super Meat Boy.  I can only assume our friends at Dagestan Technology took a look at Team Meat's success and tried to copy it as best as they could. Levels that change based on item pickups, meaningless hat accessories, and levels that are clearly far too difficult for the puny physics system implemented. As other reviewers noted, the first levels are unforgivably difficult which sets the tone for the whole game. As you continue, though, you realize that the satisfaction of completing a level is short-lived while the bad taste of a platformer that tries to hard to be something it's not lingers.  A decent platformer for those hardcore enthusiasts who enjoy brick-wall challenges and keyboard controls. For all else - just play Super Meat Boy.",
