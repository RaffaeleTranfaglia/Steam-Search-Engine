            "review_text": "So much promise and so much fail. Missing so many of the basics of a shooter. Aiming and AI is dodgy. Clipping is clunky. Knowing where you're going is nearly impossible. Everything is sluggish, forced, and makes no sense. Having to go through areas slowly and tediously to progress things and then having to start completely over because you didn't realize some picky thing caused insta-death, or clipping sucked and you fell down an insta-death pit is frustrating and constant. Everything feels laggy and and badly implimented. Don't even get me started on the ridiculous voice acting. Very hard to tell what you're supposed to be doing at any given moment; needs a map and an objectives list at the bare minimum. Menus in config don't offer any confirmation of what you're doing and aren't very explanitory. There are 4 resolution options, and that's it.   Definitely feels like an alpha or maaaaaaaybe a beta release. If they ever work things out and actually get it going, it might be ok. The visuals were nice at least. The idea is good, it's just implimented terribly right now.",

            "review_text": "I love FPS games and I love Sci-Fi so this game could be pretty good, so I thought...   Dark Raid starts without any real story, you are some kind of robot that thinks he's human or something.. After the intro scene some guy tells you to come over to him. There is no indicator on where the guy is so you will have to find him. I do not care if games try to are a little difficult or make you use your brains, but there are a lot of rooms which are basically empty and all rooms kinda look the same. If you find the guy he tells you to go back (where you just came from) to fetch a part and return to him... After that, hell breaks loose and there are some robots are trying to kill you. Then you get to a point where you have to pass some kind of puzzle of flames coming out of tubes. Everytime you hit you die instantly and have to start from the checkpoint and beat the same robots again... the puzzle is very hard so each time you die you will have to kill those robots again... you get the picture. After reading some of the other reviews, I found out this will be the case the whole game I decided not to continue anymore.  Dark Raid looks pretty good on the screenshots but what game wouldn't with the Unreal engine? The gameplay is straightforward and doesn't feel good. It could have been a good game if the developers put a little more effort in it but they didn't.  Even though you might be a Sci-Fi FPS lover this game will most likely not enjoy you, especially at the price of 20 euro, while this game should be around 2 euro.",

            "review_text": "This game might actually be fun and playable if it only had a quicksave option, then it could serve as mindless fun as a sci-fi FPS, but without it, it just is not fun at all.  Why? Is it a hard game? Not really the AI is pretty bad and it is easy to kill the enemies. However, there is a lot of environmental hazards such a timed flame spurts or acid pools that you have to dodge or jump across, and if you timing isn't exactly perfect or your jump off by one pixel? Then you are dead and doomed to repeat a long section of pretty boring and mindless combat that you just did 1 minute ago.  What is absolutely ridiculous is how this game claims to be an old-school FPS game, but then does not have the said quick save feature which was present in all old-school FPS games and was a standard until the cancerous modern FPS standard of checkpoint saves started, which is what this game uses.",

            "review_text": "One of the worst fps games I have ever played. The developers obviously don't care about their game, but just want to make money on a quick cash-in. I have played a LOT of old-school fps games, and I can say with certainty that this mess is anything but old-school. The developers thought that making your character move ridiculously fast, having no regenerating health, and a horrible aiming system that is jarring as heck would make their game old-school, traditional fps. This is most certainly not the case. Please, do not buy this game. Make these half-♥♥♥♥♥ developers go out of business, so we never have to deal with this crap again.",

The first 15 minutes of the game you run around a metallic base aimlessly, retriving a thing to bring it back to the starting point to run back to the things location a second time. Then you get a gun und need to dodge undodgeable fire, uninstall.  In times of UDV and Unity it is really really easy to make good looking games, but you feel how bad a game is once you start it, and this one is really really bad, do not buy!!",
