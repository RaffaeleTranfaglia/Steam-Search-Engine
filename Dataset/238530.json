    "description": "The title says it all. Take one part falling block puzzle game, combine one part old-school platformer, add a couple thousand pixels, blend and serve. Why match colored blocks when you can just shoot the hell out of them? Your goal is to survive as long as you can. From celebrated indie developer Andrew Morrish and Adult Swim Games.",

You may be playing as an armed piece of cheddar with massive eyebrows, but you'd best be on your damn toes in this intense puzzle platformer. But this ain't your average 'puzzle platformer', no, forget your braids and your fezzes, because this game's got GUNS, SPIKES, MISSILES, DYNAMITE, LASERS, JETPACKS, SKELETONS and BLOCK, AFTER BLOCK, AFTER BLOCK, THREATENING TO TURN YOU INTO CREAM CHEESE.  And to top it all off, this game has a BLAST PROCESSING option, which does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.",

            "review_text": "It's very frustrating at first, because pretty much everything instantly kills you, and there are a lot of rules that you just have to learn by dying, and also some nuance to the rules that you just have to learn by accident or via the special challenges (e.g. if you jump or fall onto spikes, it instantly kills you, but if you walk onto spikes that are the same horizontal level as you, it's totally safe).  It's extremely challenging, but once you die enough to figure out what in the hell is going on, it's actually a really creative idea for a falling block game. Extremely challenging, but honestly very fun. Especially once you start unlocking alternate characters with different special abilities. (The dual wield character is my jam.)  I'll give this one the thumbs up. Especially if it's in a sale.",

Every once in a while you get a 'gem'. You can move onto the next area once you have enough gems.   Simple in concept. Very entertaining in practice. Very much a 'one more round' kind of game.",

From the graphics, to the simple-yet-addicting gameplay system, and especially the music, this feels like a great game from that era of consoles that was just warped through time and put on Steam.",

            "review_text": "A fun diversion, but compared to the Flash version of this game this is an improvement, but not by enough to justify the price. Most of the new characters are not different enough to justify playing the game more (the jetpack guy is the sole exception), and the new levels add some variety, but none have much depth.  But worst of all they do nothing to fix the Flash game's biggest issue, death is often cheap with you getting insta-killed by a saw blade or a bullet you had no way of avoiding.  Do yourself a favor, save your money by either A) playing the free Flash version or B) playing Super Crate Box.",

The alternate costumes/powersets give it a bit of variety, but this is not a game I see myself keeping installed to score-attack, and even at a mere 6 levels with their own gimmicks/obstacles it felt like it was wearing out its welcome by the end. I'm honestly not sure if I recommend this or not.  In fact, I'm kinda gonna say skip it? Unless the above sounded REALLY INTERESTING to you, it's basically the entire game in a single paragraph. The 'challenges' are fun but again, really only worth doing once since they're identical every time (and I mean IDENTICAL, not just samey like the stages).",

Not really knowing the mechanics or even the buttons. After a while we were figuring out how you loose a level and what not. Very cool and retro inspired game. Sort of wish that the 'fire' buttons were on the shoulder vs. the trigger because of the delay with hitting the trigger. You can change the buttons but it is very complicated vs. just seeing the whole controller on the screen and just reassigning the buttons. Kind of wish there were more options for the characters even if it was just a color swap after you select the character.",
