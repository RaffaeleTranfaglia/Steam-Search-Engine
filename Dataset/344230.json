            "review_text": "This is the fourth Pixel Puzzles game I've played, and the only one so far that I would not recommend. I love puzzles, both physical and digital, and I finished every puzzle in this game, but there were so many built-in and unnecessary annoyances that I couldn't recommend it to anyone else.  First and most importantly, someone had the idea to make the background patterned. I'm sure they meant well, but building a patterned puzzle on a patterned backdrop is extremely difficult, especially with the larger puzzles that have smaller pieces. With some, seeing the edges was nearly impossible, even with changing the color of the patterned backdrop. Without being able to make out the shape of the edges, adding pieces became a sort of 'trial-and-error' of dropping every somewhat-matching piece into the spot and hoping one will fit. There is, as far as I could see, no way to get a nice solid background to work with, only color-changes of the pattern; this can help but doesn't solve the problem. To me, this is a game-ruining design flaw.  The hint system isn't awful but it adds another layer of annoyance. The crabs you have to gather to 'spend' on hints spawn directly under your cursor. If you're trying to work in an area, you have to drop the piece you're working on to move the damned crab out of the way. If by some chance the crab spawns where you have a few pieces piled up, you have to move every piece before you can grab the crab. If you have a LOT of pieces piled up (i.e. if you're sorting them), it can take forever to get everything moved so you can get the crab moved. Not game breaking, but very annoying.  The other problem I had with it was purely aesthetic. Birds aren't the most interesting thing to me, but I was expecting bright birds with pretty plumage, tropical birds and pea♥♥♥♥♥, things that are pretty and make great puzzles. Instead, you get a lot of penguins, ducks, and raptors, and very few were bright and engaging. The end result for me personally was boredom. By the final, largest puzzle, I was sick of brown birds, brown ducks, and hundreds of penguins. So I opened the last puzzle to fiinish this game off, and there were more penguins (I shook my head with a sigh and sallied forth anyway). There was some variety in the pictures, but even the variety was dull. Now, this is a personal preference so others might not agree here, but it was my personal opinion on it.  So after 20+ hours playing the game and finishing every puzzle for the sake of my own achievement-seeking OCD, I just can't recommend it to anyone else unless the poor background and annoying hint system aren't likely to bother you.",

            "review_text": "Pixel Puzzle franchise. Recommended for those who literally like to put puzzles together, and I do mean piece by piece.   Pixel Puzzles 2: Birds  Features birds, of course, all kinds, everywhere - fenceposts to snow covered areas, big, small, entire colonies. There is even an introduction puzzle found on the main screen. 25 puzzles in all ranging from 60 pieces to 350 pieces, with some odd shaped and bird themed puzzle pieces. All the puzzles can be seen in the picture gallery once the puzzle is solved. The game grid is more or less choose your path around the grid.  Puzzles: 60 piece - 6, 112 piece - 6, 153 piece- 4, 220 piece - 6, and 350 piece - 1.  The game board is surrounded by water where the puzzle pieces float and MOVE. The pieces also must be rotated to gain the correct orientation (like in a physical puzzle.) Fortunately there is an option for the player to choose the correct orientation permenantly (or until such time as the player chooses to turn it off). I recommend having this feature on for the 220 piece and 350 piece puzzles due to the size of the pieces.  Best feature of this game: Crabs. Now, now no laughing. These helpful crustaceans can be picked off the puzzle board and put in a net. When the player has collected enough a hint can be used. 'G' stands for 'ghost' (cost 5 crabs). This power-up shows the puzzle picture for approximately 10 seconds. 'Ctrl' (10 crabs) will cause that puzzle to have the correct orientation (unless the player rotates the piece). 'space bar' This helpful power up (20 crabs) shows exactly where that piece belongs in the puzzle, edge or middle. Other functions: 'T' make a tray to hold the pieces, 'S' shuffle the pieces. 'Z' zoom in on the puzzle board. 'C' change the puzzle board's background color.   There 33 achievements including ones like 'No More Crabs' and 'Ghost Power'. Trading cards are available.",

            "review_text": "Well, this was a switch from the usual games I play on Steam but I have to admit, the kids and I have had fun putting these puzzles together. The pieces floating around the edge adds to the challenge because the pieces don't stay in a stationary location around the puzzle. The kids love catching the crabs as they appear around the puzzle.   One fix would be to make the bonuses from collecting the crabs clickable instead of keys on the keyboard.  For a slow paced challenge, I'd say give this one a try.",

            "review_text": "   An improvement over the last two Pixel Puzzles games,  Japan  and  UndeadZ .   Now there's a save function, system settings stay the same after you restart the game, there are window resolution options though minimal, and the floating puzzle pieces on the pond are a little easier to click on. When you start up a puzzle all progress is automatically saved when you exit. You can even start up a new puzzle and have the previous one you were working stay intact.  If you want to make the game slightly tougher you can enable puzzle piece rotation as well though they still snap on to the mat like a magnet and you still can't put two puzzle pieces together outside of the magnets. For some reason though if you disable piece rotation the game won't remember you did when you restart the game.  As you move puzzle pieces around on the mat, crabs will start appearing though only 2 can spawn at a time. Apparently you're supposed to drag them to the net on the side of the screen so you can use handicap abilities depending on how many crabs are in the net. You use 5 crabs to show a ghost image of the puzzle for a few seconds, 10 crabs to have a held puzzle piece correctly rotated if rotation is enabled, and 20 crabs to show where the piece you're currently holding is supposed to go to. If you exit the current puzzle the crab net will be emptied out.  There are varying puzzles that have 60 pieces, 112 pieces, 153, 220, and one with 350 at the very end. There's no specific order you can complete them but finishing a puzzle unlocks the corresponding locked puzzles on the puzzle select screen.  From the technical side of things it's an improvement. Getting interested in this game is just going to be based on if you somehow actually got into the premise of the other Pixel Puzzles titles and/or if you fancy pseudo-jigsaw puzzles that magnetize on a mat with birds as the theme.",
