            "review_text": "What to say about Faerie Solitaire? I saw a bunch of my Steam friends playing this and went ahead an bought it a while back, but didnt really crack into it until recently. It was a very pleasant surprise. It's solitaire with a few twists and a little story about a kid who finds faeries in captivity and frees them while seeking out the reason all of this is happening. Nothing too deep about the story, but it does hold your interest well enough, and is a nice fable on its own.  The gameplay itself is simple enough...it is not exactly solitaire, in that rather than match suits until you run out of cards, you are instead trying to build combos to take off the board using your held cards as the base card for said combos. The bigger the combo, the more it is worth. Additionally, you unlock powers such as being able to automatically link a card that would not normally combo, receive extra hold cards to use when you see fit, and build faerie structures that add benefits such as extra undo-s (which you can use to go back one move if you realize you made a mistake), the ability to look at the next card in your deck, and so on. Each round is made up of nine hands, and there were something like 27 rounds total, broken up into story chapters (each chapter is 3 rounds). Each round has a set of goals, which might include a certain card total combo being reached (8, 10, 12, even 15 in some rounds), acquire a certain amount of points, and fill your charge meter within a certain amount of time. You cant move forward until you meet all the goals, so you may end up repeating a round from time to time.  Anyway, I found this to be a pleasant game with a reasonable amount of challenge, but still something you can do while distracted or feeling particularly unmotivated to do much of anything. I guess what I am saying is it is completely accessible to anybody, can be played in small snippets, and easily fills the gaming void when you aren't sure what else you want to play.  9 out of 10",

You do have to enjoy the basic mechanic in Solitaire of flipping cards over and figuring out where to put them, but there is quite a bit more going on than that (figuring out the best path to maximize combo streaks, buying upgrades, leveling up pets, choosing when to save or use powerups to go for combo points or to complete objectives, etc)",

Yeah, okay - the storyline is you need to free the fairies and stock up on logs and rocks so you can upgrade your (utterly useless, literally do nothing at all) pets like the Unicorn and the Chimera but the fact is, the game - a spin on spider solitaire - is indeed enjoyable and quite addicting. This is my go-to game for relaxing at the end of a long day, needing some mindless repetition to keep my mind nice and still while I work through the days events. Perfect for a bit of quiet time before bed, when you want to be occupied but not over-stimulated.   Solid 4/5, if you're a fan of Solitaire games.",

There are objectives scattered here and their (like get so many matches in a row, or farm so much gold) that you have to complete to advance the game but one you get the hang of the mechanics they are fairly easy to meet. There are some super moves (which you can purchase and some that unlock) thrown on top of the standard solitaire rules, like having to use a fire spell power up to melt an ice card that is otherwise blocking your stack of cards. I liked these touches and it helped to keep me at the game when a standard solitaire rule set would have bored me. Graphically it’s sparse but has a nice fantasy theme, music never bothered me and the story is told in story book cut scenes which I found charming. If you like fantasy settings and solitaire than this is the game for you.",

Now, I somehow have 14 hours and I'm not sure how that happened...   It's a play on the card game solitaire, but contains power moves and the like. It goes through a story (I dunno, about fairies overcoming evil or something) and you go through different levels of difficulty to complete the game. When you complete levels, you collect monetary rewards which enable you to buy level ups. These give you abilities within the game. Also through the game, you collect little eggs which hatch into cutesy creatures. They are completely pointless, do nothing and are impertinent to the game, but I guess if you are 11 and enjoy collecting creatures you might appreciate it. The game difficulty progresses well and it's seriously addictive, to the point where you find you've completed the game and have 14 hours on it... :( It's a nice little 'side' game as you are doing other things, such as listening to music or waiting for things to download, and I would definitely recommend buying it on the sale as something to pick up for 20 minutes at a time.",

Each game takes 1-2 minutes, each level has 9 games and a level-specific goal to achieve. The goals are easy to achieve, but perfection is not.  - The adventure mode has a story which is cute but fairly generic. It's a card game, after all. Still, I enjoyed it. The voice acting was even decent.  - The resources and pet gathering was fun. It doesn't affect the outcome of the game in any way but if you enjoy collecting pets/achievements, you'll find some entertainment in it.

            "review_text": " tl;dr -&gt; Was itching for a dirt-cheap impulse buy and happened upon this super simple game and decided to give it a try. 11/10 Solitaire-style gameplay while you raise some dragons.   I got this game because I was bored and wanted a mindless title to pass the time. I was quite surprised with my gameplay experience.  If you like Solitaire-style card games, faery themes, and raising dragons, then you might enjoy this game.   The aesthetics are decent - the amount of detail in the cards are very simple. The music and sounds are okay - they do add to the mystical/relaxing vibe emitted by the game - but I quickly muted the music in favor of my own.  Controls are super simple and only involve mouse clicking. There is no tutorial, but tips are always provided when a new element is introduced. The learning curve is mostly non-existent to minimal depending on your knowledge of card games involving a standard deck of 52.  Gameplay consists of you trying to clear a randomized arrangement of cards before running out of cards in your deck (Solitaire-style format). You start by drawing a card, and must click on cards in the play area to interact with your active card. Unlike Solitaire, you can click on cards exactly one value higher or lower than your active card. For example, you start a level and draw a 5 - you can now click on any 4's or 6's in the play area (note that you cannot click on 5's). Chaining combos are important in this game because it will allow you to build up your score meter faster, resulting in more money awarded and a better end score. Your end score fills up a 'global' meter that is shown at the end of every level (or hand). After 9 hands, you must have accumulated enough points to free a captured faery. There is always one level objective that lasts for all 9 hands (ex: achieve a 8-chain combo), and completing this will boost your score and money.   New mechanics are added as you progress through the game to keep things challenging. One includes a vine stack that cannot be accessed until you clear a separate stack of cards that has a flower at the end. Another common one is an ice stack of cards that can only be used if you first click a 'fire' card, which is usually located beneath many other cards.  Money is used to buy upgrades in the Faereland in the form of buildings. These upgrades will give you things like an extra undo (you start with only 1 and can get up to a maximum of 3) and a count of how many cards are left in your deck. Sometimes, resources will also drop when you clear a stack of cards - these are used to hatch and evolve your dragons. Yes, dragons.  After playing for a while, you will eventually find a dragon egg (there are a large number of dragon variants). You can hatch them once you've accumulated enough resources (there are 3 kinds). Your dragon will start as a baby, and you can select one active dragon at a time - your active dragon will gain experience whenever you win a hand. Once your dragon receives enough experience, it will evolve and have some lore you can read.  Besides the standard story mode, there is a challenge mode and the ability to replay previous levels.   Overall, the game plays well for a Solitaire-based game with extra elements to keep it from running dry. If you are interested in this style of gameplay, then give it a try. I try not to mention price if I feel it is unnecessary, but I got this game when it was discounted at 95% ($0.54 CAD) and sincerely think that this is not worth the full price at all ($10.99 CAD). The content is just far too shallow to warrant that price, when countless other titles exist for the same, if not lower price.   Recommend!  Cheers, DJSF  @DJSF's Rogue Reviews  ",

However, if all of the cards from the board, you win prizes that can be used to hatch eggs and raise fantasy creatures. The fantasy creatures are completely non-interactive, and are displayed like museum pieces. Each set of hands completed advances the fairy tale storyline, which is pretty bland. The problem with the story is it is released in such small pieces that it is sometimes hard to follow. The story is boring, but thankfully the card game itself isn't so bad.

Definitely worth that though past that, it's pushing it. The reasons are pretty simple.  It's solitaire and it beats the Windows version by a long shot in presentation and aesthetics but comparing a premium to a freebie isn't fair.  You can spend gold you earnt in rounds on unique power ups that help to get 'perfects' in the game like destroying cards off stacks, undos and gold boosts.  There is a pet collecting system which feels tacked on. You find random eggs in-rounds but the chances are extremely low. There's actually people that resorted to using mouse scripts to getting their final eggs. You level up the pets so they evolve but they just sitting there in a picture form. Bad game design in my opinion though you could argue it was a 'bonus' feature.  Subsoap tried to fit a story into this genre and while their efforts were noteworthy, I found it very uninspiring (though the voice actor was alright) and just skipped most of it. You just go around various stages and free faeries after meeting objectives.  So in conclusion, yes, I would recommend this game but only if you're a die-hard solitaire fan and the game is going for £1 or less. Not a penny more I'm afraid.

Now there's an alleged story element as well, demonstrating itself as nothing more than powerpoint slides with some voiceover narration. It would work well on its own as a children's fable, but as it stands it is simply jarring and distracts one from the experience, and gets in the way of the card game. The story element might count as a visual novel, if one was willing to disrespect the vast genre of visual novels by including this game's 'story' in its ranks.

            "review_text": "I'm up to 56 games following the Summer Sale, and honestly, Faerie Solitaire may be my greatest gain following the money sink.  The sounds of this game set the mood. It's relaxed, with lute/harp/whatever-esque strums used as you move through menus. You have nature sounds in the background as you play through the game, and you get nice musical overtures when you complete a stage.  The game is pretty-- not ground-breaking graphics or anything, but everything about it looks nice. It's a card game and it understands that. It never tries to be overly fabulous. It's two-dimensional, it's got good artwork, and things have auras and sparkles and glows. Don't let that last bit throw you off-- it's subtle enough that it won't annoy you.  You'll find eggs and materials and stuff like that to grow baby pets into badass not-baby pets. You get dragons and all that good stuff. You also unlock power-ups and improvements to your game; stuff like improved hatching speeds, seeing how many cards you have left in your deck, and cheat codes where you can see what's the next card in the stack.  But the thing that matters the most is that the game is just ♥♥♥♥ing fun. It's casual and it accepts that. It's the game you play when you're tired but can't sleep, when you don't want to think too hard, or you're in the middle of searching for a match on LoL or whatever you play and it's taking a very long time. The game does what it does well, and it doesn't try to be your favorite game, but it accidentally comes close anyway.",

The music is quite nice fits the levels well without ever being intrusive. Sometimes I did feel like the AI was cheating a little bit, but I guess that's the nature of these games.

The gameplay itself is fun, fast paced, and simple with unlockable abilities that only make the experience more enjoyable. An assortment of relatively enjoyable challenges exist, as well as a small batch of side content, but it doesn't do much other than provide a minor incentive to achievement hunt. Strangely enough, this game is listed for $9.99 and at that price it simply isn't worth it. However, it's frequently on sale for 90% off ($0.99) and a must have.
