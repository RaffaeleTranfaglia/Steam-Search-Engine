            "review_text": "Updated 10/29 for the PC re-release that happened on 10/28:  Many of the worst issues in the original release of this game have been resolved, but if it came out as-is today I would still say the port is pretty disappointing. Many people who couldn't play the game at all before can get a playable framerate now, but even on a very high end system the frame pacing is very poor and results in a stuttery experience.   The texture loading issues that plagued the game on release are gone, but you still see shockingly low resolution textures during almost any cut scene.  Image quality is all over the board, but is improved quite a bit by turning off AA, CA, and film grain effects.   Speaking of effects, there seems to be a bug that scales the intensity of post-processing effects with the screen resolution the game renders at. The most obviously visible occurance of this bug is when lens flares are rendered. In 1080p, lens flares look more or less as they should. At 1440p you'd think Batman just had LASIK surgery because looking at a street light produces a double or triple lens flare corona that makes it very difficult to see what is going on. Considering the whole game takes place at night and there are more lens flares than a JJ Abrams movie this bug can get pretty irritating.  If you're a huge batman fan and you've been waiting to play this game, I'd say it is definitely playable now. If you're on the fence and were waiting to see whether they had turned a legendarily bad release into a good one for rerelease, I'd say wait until it is heavily discounted.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Original review of initial release version:   One of the worst PC ports of all time.  This game had some incredibly misleading advertising. In the Nvidia gamework promo reel, posted to youtube by Nvidia on June 6 (only a few weeks before the game was released), they show ambient occlusion and rain textures - both of which are present in the console versions, and entirely absent from the PC version. The same gameworks promo trailer is also a full 60fps, but the game ships with a 30fps cap. By editing an .ini file you can remove the 30fps cap, but many have reported that causes other graphical issues such as textures only loading the very lowest detail level (they look pretty similar to the textures from a Nintendo 64 game).  Aside from the false advertising, this game can't even maintain a consistent framerate on hardware that FAR exceeds the recommended specifications. For example, despite having the game installed on an SSD, and running a 980ti with the latest drivers, I still get dips into single digit framerates in many situations. For example, any time I get in the batmobile, I am watching a slide show for a few seconds.  Save your money and wait to buy this game until it is fixed (if it ever does get fixed).",

Since then I've watched and read dozens of reviews of both PC and PS versions and it was still getting mixed bad opinions.

Now that I've finished the game I can safely say it was a great and very enjoyable experience. I won't spoil anything here, not a big fan of the ending but it was a great story. All the little touches and details you would expect from the previous games are here as well. Never had a stutter or crash and I'm on a slightly above average PC.  Won't go in detail, just want to say this - if you were put off by the fail-launch and negative reviews since then, give this game a chance. I love the previous ones in the series, but this is the first one I almost completed at 100% (only riddler trophies remain and they are really a grind). And the top point of many reviewers that the CAR is shoved on you and takes away - I was afraid of that, but no, really no, it adds and takes sometimes but it's not in any way obtrusive.  If in doubt - buy on sale!",

I have a 2gig GTX 960, it's obviously the biggest regret of my rig so far but I'm waiting for the next line of GPU's to come out before I waste my money on a 980ti. I have stuttering when turning the camera, when driving, etc. It's crazy bad even on the lowest settings. I do get 60 fps in a majority of areas, but as soon as I turn the camera or drive it dips in the 40s. It's sad because the game stutters even worse when I lock it back at 30 fps. It's just flat out broken concerning performance, and I really wish to enjoy the game. The arkham games are some of my favorite games of all time, and I will give a positive review once these performance problems are fixed. Until then, save your money.",

            "review_text": "When I played Arkham Origins, I thought it was a fine game with some notable flaws that made it inferior to Arkham City, but all would be made right with the release of Arkham Knight. But that's not exactly what happened -- instead, I think Arkham Knight is a fine game with some notable flaws that make it inferior to Arkham City.  Let's tackle the first elephant in the room: the botched port and initial release. It stank up Steam so bad that it single-handedly  kickstarted  popularized the refund policy ( thanks to Link XL1 for pointing out refunds actually started a bit earlier than AK ), and it was the reason I held off on actually buying it until a good long while had passed, despite being a massive fan of the series. I can be brief about this: my brand new rig has 16 GB of memory and a GTX 1070, and the game runs at a near-constant 70 FPS at 1440p maxed settings while looking absolutely gorgeous. Now, I get that not everyone has had that experience, or will have that experience, but I can only judge the game on how it plays for me at this point in time, and I have no reason to complain. That's not to say I tihnk that putting out a release as broken as this one is in any way acceptable or excusable -- it's not -- but I'm not going to count it against the game in its current state.  The same can't be said for elephant number two, which is the Batmobile. The Dynamic Duo in this game isn't Batman and Robin, but Batman and his amazing rooftop-hopping car. It quickly veers from cool into silly and contrived, and about the only thing missing is the Batmobile doing inverted takedowns (it  does  hang upside down a few times, so that's not as implausible as it sounds...). They made sure you can't miss out on the experience by putting in vehicular combat and puzzles that require the Batmobile, but I found myself more frustrated than entertained by these sections. Despite what the game designers thought, it would have been completely fine if the Batmobile had just been there as a cooler way of getting you from A to B. Throw in the optional racetracks for the people who like that sort of thing, I'm fine with that. Have maybe  one  sequence where the Batmobile gets to slug it out with a tank or helicopter, sure. But repeated vehicular combat sequences and painfully forced puzzle sequences just detract from the experience. While you can avoid almost all racing and puzzles if you just don't go after the Riddler (as if!) the tank battles are there to stay. It's as if someone baked you a delicious, velvety smooth chocolate cake, except that they mixed in crunchy peanuts to chip your teeth on, because they read somewhere that chocolate and peanuts go well together.  There are a lot of things Arkham Knight gets right, too. The meat and potatoes of the game, combat and predator encounters, work as smooth as ever, and there are the requisite tweaks and new moves to keep things interesting without completely unbalancing things like the shock gloves in Origins did. There's a smorgasbord of villains on the loose in Gotham waiting for you to arrest them, and they all involve different gameplay, so you can easily mix things up without getting bored. The voice acting is top notch, both from the regulars and the guest villains (special tip of the hat to Dwight Schultz, who plays a terrifying Professor Pyg -- I was surprised to find out it was him when I looked it up). The story is engaging, and I'm happy to say that's still the case even if you had the identity of the Arkham Knight spoiled before you picked up the game, like I did. I especially like the way the writers justified the issue of Batman suddenly deciding to stick massive guns on his Batmobile (even if they do conveniently fire 'non-lethal rounds' when targeting humans). If this sounds a bit out of character for Batman, it's because it is... and you'll find out why as you play the game. Having said that, I'm definitely not a fan of the ending (the true ending you get with 100% completion), which is deliberately ambiguous on the ultimate fate of Batman and Gotham. It's not terrible, I can live with it, but it still feels like a cop-out and something the writers could absolutely have avoided in favor of a stronger statement. As a cap to the whole series, it's a bit underwhelming.  Arkham Knight gets an easy 'recommended' from me, but it's not as great as the final installment could have been.",

An absolutely worthless gesture for the majority of gamers. Seriously, 'People who purchased the fourth game in the series, get the first three games for free!' in what world does that make sense?

            "review_text": "You may notice at the top of the page that the Overall Reviews are Mixed but the recent reviews are Overwhelminhly Positive. At first, I thought this was a joke the internet was playing, like how the Cory in the House DS game has a 9.5 user score on Metacritic, but then I read some of the reviews and some forum posts and saw that people are saying the game is playable now. So, I picked this game up cheap (the game's reputation has lowered its price on third party stores) and I played it. Let me tell you, it was definitely worth it.   Is the game playable? Yes. Is it well optimized now? Oh God no. There was a lot of stuttering when I first loaded up the game, or when I go to new areas in the open world. But, I'm a patient man so I was able to deal with it. It should be noted that I have a 4 year old card so some of the higher end GPUs will probably have better performances. Other than that, the only other bugs I encountered were small texture bugs. I never experienced any game breaking bugs.   Now on to the actual game. How is it? Well, my recommendation should tell you that I very much enjoyed the game. I think it's the best in the series (which is not an opinion shared by many). I felt the story was extremely well done. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that the other Arkham games were really focused on the plot and the supervillians that Batman goes up against, but this game really explores Batman himself as a character. Again, some people were a bit disappointed by the story, especially with the reveal of the Arkham Knight, but I was fine with it. I was never a die-hard Batman comic book fan so I don't share the same point of view as those people.   The gameplay is where the game really shines. I loved everything about it. Even the Batmobile. I had a lot of fun driving around Gotham. At first, the driving controls felt really wonky, but once I got used to it, it felt really great. Now the tank mode. A lot of people hated it, but I found it very enjoyable. You can probably notice a trend here...  How about the ground combat? They improved nearly everything from AC. No longer can you 'spam Y to win'. They have added many new enemies into the game, such as electricty covered enemies and medics, that require you to change up your tactics. There is also a 'Fear Takedown' ability that allows you to take out multiple enemies in one go without the enemy being able to react, which helps makes Predator Mode faster and more enjoyable. Finally, when travelling around the city, it is mostly unchanged, but they did buff the grapple boost since the city is MUCH bigger this time around.   This game is a great conclusion to the trilogy. The story is very well done (but the ending was a bit weak), the presentation is godly (well, when everything is working properly), the gameplay is the best it has ever been, and the music OH THE MUSIC. The PC version is playable now and you can get it for cheap during a Steam Sale or on a third party site. If you are a fan of the Arkham series, you should get this game. If you are new, play AC first, then come to this.",

The release date and reviews did not mention any graphical driver related problems. I feel betrayed as they have been silent after pulling the game and they have not given any explanation that makes any sense. They have not taken responcibility trying to dump all the blame on another dev studio. There would have been bosses looking into the progress of the PC version too. Also there was an NVIDIA team working on the game this means they too have kept quiet as they must have known it wasn't ready. I have read in reviews that there are some nice effcts running on the AMD hardware console version for PS4. I expect to see them also on my AMD Graphics card as they were shown in the advertising though I won't be holding my breath. NVIDIA have sold this game with £300+ Graphics cards so to all those saying they aren't so miffed as they got it for free? Really? you payed for the game with the card albeit subsidised by NVIDIA somewhat. NVIDIA have had this game on their Promotional mateirial for ages and this will hurt them in a big way again. I wonder if anyone has attempted to return their Graphics card with the game out of complete distrust towards NVIDIA as the game they advertised was clearly different to the retail product. You can not lawfully sell something that isn't as described that is a criminal offence. This is why they pulled the game to try any soften the legal blow. In my opinion the deception towards the customers and then taking their money should become a criminal investigation as this needs to STOP RIGHT NOW. If they knew they would be prosecuted at court and fined huge amounts they would end this con immediately. I would also like to know if STEAM have tested the game prior to allowing it for sale as they should check the game themselves as they too have been advertising it for ages to release it broken and then pull it from sale straight after?  Stop treating PC Gamers like were idiots, we will not take this any longer.",

I haven't had a single glitch in that time. Follow the recommended specs, and you should be fine.  For the game itself, it's both good and bad. I still like Asylum the best of the series. I think it was actually the right size in terms of gameplay with a good progression overall to both main and side quests. This game is enormous, and it's really not always in a good way.  First, the good:  The Batmobile is pretty awesome. I was genuinely surprised. I thought it would by clunky and pointless like most attempts to add vehicles into established series are, but it actually plays really well. I think the chase side missions involving the batmobile are some of the most fun in the game. The pseudo-destruction reaped upon the city as you mow down statues and cleave off corners of walls adds to the feeling that you're driving an incredibly powerful machine. Mowing down an entire riot of baddies sending them flying in all directions is also entertaining. It's over-powered, but the game compensates for that by locking off encounters that should be fought without it.  The new types of side missions are also cool. I like the addition of the flying drones, and the takedown method for them is clever. The different types of bad guys are managed well, and there are lots of creative opportunities for playing around with your abilities.  The Mediocre:  The story has its good points, but a lot of it is really melodramatic and predictable. Harley Quinn's voice is the single most annoying thing ever created. Picture everything she says as voiced by Jar Jar for added entertainment value. The way The Joker is handled is a lot of fun. I think that's the most entertaining part of the story. The part that's trying to be a Nolan movie just fell on its face for me. Yea, I get it already. Joker/Batman represent an ethical duality where they're both really two sides of the same coin. They exist outside the law pursuing their own view of the world at the expense of society based solely on their own beliefs. Blah blah blah. Please stop beating me over the head with it like it's not a simple, well-trodden idea. It works really well when they treat it as satire. The Joker has some great moments openly mocking you or egging you on. A number of times I wished I could actually choose to do what he suggested. That would've made a much better game in my opinion. There's also some good chatter of the generic bad guys commenting on elements of the world or just their own generic nature. When it tries to take itself seriously, it becomes dull in its trauma.  The Bad:  This game is huge. This seems like a weird thing to cite as bad, but it's so absurdly large that it becomes genuinely aggravating. The side quests are the biggest example. There's an entire wheel of side quests. I'm not sure how many there are exactly, but I'd estimate around 20. They're not just go somewhere, do the thing, and finish the quest type of deals. You go do the thing, and then five more of that thing appear an hour later. So you go do those five, but then still five more appear another hour later. After fifteen to twenty-five of them, you might finally be done. That's the case for nearly every single one of the twenty different side quests. Some things aren't even official side quests but still need to be eliminated anyway like the aerial drones.  So you clear out a sector of the map. Then you progress in the story a little, and all of a sudden that sector isn't clear anymore. It's not filled with something new and cool though. It just has a few more of exactly the same time-consuming thing you already cleared out the first time. It's fun clearing out the aerial drones the first 5-8 times. When they start appearing four more at a time in the late game, it's just painful. The checkpoints would also be fun just a few times, but there are like 40 of them to clear out. Many of the side quests are really just the same thing in a 'different situation.' Rescuing firefighters, clearing military checkpoints, and clearing out watchtowers all involve taking out exactly the same clustered group of baddies in basically the same way. You're just doing it for a supposedly different goal. Every single one of those will have to be done so many times to fulfill their own quests that you'll have no desire to finish them. My hat is off to anyone who has 100% this game. That's a Sisyphean task to me.  It goes further. There are 243 riddler puzzles. I kid you not. I'm actually bored just by the idea of going after them all. It's obvious someone just went through the map after they finished this massive city and stuck a trophy in every single place you could possibly fit one. It's obnoxious. All of this goes against basic game design principles. Have a clear and varied progression that increases in challenge. Most of the content in this game is the same thing over and over. The unfortunate part of that is it really takes away from the parts of the game that are well-designed and do present a varied challenge. I understand they were trying to make a huge epic conclusion, but they really cluttered it up and made it shallow by throwing in too much of the same kinds of content.  Synopsis:  Overall I recommend it. I paid about $13 for it on sale, and I think I got more than enough good content for my money. I'd pay up to $20 for it. Pay the price tag if you really love the series and know you can run it. The story isn't bad and does have both fun and cool moments. The batmobile is awesome to play with, and the city is fun to fly around sporadically wrecking baddies. Explore the more varied content until you feel like you've seen everything you want to, and then quit. Much of the extra content and side quests quickly become overly similar and boring. Don't plan to 100% the game. For reference, I did 100% Asylum and loved it. I wouldn't recommend even trying to 50% this one in terms of completing all side quests and clearing all sectors. It's not a fun task. Play through the main story and explore, and you'll have a good time with it. I'd say 7/10 for a rating.",

Enter Arkham Knight: A game with little to no graphics settings, a framerate that dips into single digits on the regular, and an awful DRM system. It's sad to see a series I have played and loved on the PC end like this. Do yourself a favor, do not purchase this game.

I even went as far as playing through this game even when it first released just because I have a huge appreciation for what the Arkham games brought the table when it comes to world building, art and game design. With that said, the release of this game was a sham. The game was unplayable for a huge chunk of the P.C. fanbase and even those of us who could play it had to deal with countless issues. The season pass was shady, as usual, and months later we've come to find that the DLC that we got was just... disappointing- barely adding anything worth experiencing.   Bugs and DLC aside, the game itself is a bit of a disappointment. The story feels flat and unsatisfying, Riddler is extra annoying with his unnecessarily large amount of trophies and really out of place Riddler races. The Batmobile was a thing you were forced with deal with rather than a fun addition to the game. The cast seems interesting and promising but fails to deliver; I really wanted to see more of Robin and Catwoman, Batman's interaction with his constantly-falling-appart family, anything. It's the last game in the series, give the fans closure... but no. Instead there's a repetitive and predictable story filled with the same tropes and structure anyone who's read a Batman comic in the past 10 years has seen over and over again.   With that said, the gameplay is still good ol' Arkham. Combat is still fun and snappy, beating up thug after brainless thug is still satisfying. The game is gorgeous when it wants to be and the art design is still awesome. I guess that's a plus. Let's face it, if you're a fan of the series you're probably going to get the game anyway but, as much as it pains me to say it, I would hold on to that thought. Wait until it's in a better condition or even better, wait for a  very  deep discount.",

Huge public outcry, so they pull game from shelves. They then sit virtually incommunicado for 4 months and release a patch that actually makes it WORSE fro some users. More silence. Two months later they put it back on sale after another patch, recommend that you have a MINIMUM 12 GB of RAM to run the game, release DLC they charge a fortune for despite it being uniformly crap, and offer as recompense free copies of the other Arkham games which 90% of purchasers already own.   I bought the season pass. I didn't get a refund, thinking (wrongly) that users would have the right thing done by them. I already own EVERY Arkham game, so for my patience and loyalty I get absolutely NOTHING. The behaviour of WB has been nothing short of disgusting. On these reasons alone I do not recommend you buy this or any other WB/Rocksteady game EVER. Play them if you like (and I'm sure you know how to arrange this) but do not give them your money. They simply do not deserve it.  As for the game itself...aside from the stuttering cutscenes, the way the dialogue that can't quite keep up with the graphics, and the frame drops (and I'm running a system with 32GB RAM and twin 4GB cards but dual cards areen't supported lol) and the tearing, and all the extra NVIDEA effects that cripple frame rate....it's ok. The timing on the combat seems out but you get used to it, the batmobile is cool enough but overused (oh and you can't use the DLC skins for it in game, only in the stupid 'races' which are just obstacle courses). The map is huge but a lot of it doesn't have much to do in it, aside from speeding past it in the batmobile. The story is ok, The gadgets are ok. The DLC is terrible - you can't even use all the costumes in game except in the AR challenges. Some of the new enemy types - medics, those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with drones - are a nice addition.As for the mystery of the Arkham Knight? Took me 5 minutes to get it right. Ho hum.    Is it anywhere as near as good as Asylum or City? No. If you want a good Batman game buy those. If you already own those get Shadow of Mordor (which is excellent just don't waste your time on the DLC) - the gameplay is essentially the same with a fantasy twist, you actually have to THINK to take down Captains, the story is great and the Nemesis system adds a brillaint new mechanic.   If Arkham Knight was super cheap - under $10 - and you have 12GB of RAM - MAYBE. But frankly just don't give your money to WB, and play something else - there's a ton of far more deserving games and publishers out there. Buy Phantom Pain or ARmello or that Rocket soccer car game everyone seems to like. Hell give the money to a homeless guy or your favorite charity. Flush it down the toilet. Buy some meth. Whatever floats your boat. Just don't give a publisher that thinks treating customers like ♥♥♥♥ is ok any of your hard earned cash. Vote with your wallets, it's the only way they will learn.

The game is not well optimized, we need some stutter fix. When i just spin the camera i drop from everything between from 68 to 21 FPS. Super annoying when i'm gliding, as it can drop to even 1 FPS. I even used the performance test in the game and got solid 48+ FPS atleast, it looked smooth and quite sexy. Not what i get in the game though, it's not as sexy. :/  As long as it is like this, i do not want to recommend it. But atleast in the little sequence where i got into a fight, it was good, it felt like Batman combat, smooth 40 FPS, hehe...  EDIT: Other than that let's review the rest of the game. As of now i've gotten a bit more play time, so i'll break down somme of the elements in the game.   Combat:  I love it. The basic combat is easy and satisfying, it looks smooth and cool and you just land a sick punch after another. There are some more advanced combat, where you can sneak upon enemies and take them down easily in a chain from 3 to 5, a mechanic that makes it easier to take down armed enemies and it's a reward for stelathing.   The Batmobile:  It looks amazing, it's such a massive tool and has a beautiful design. The driving however, feels too heavy, it feels like you're driving a boosted tank, steering it is kinda weird, but powersliding works fine. There is however a combat mechanic in the batmobile where you kind of control it like a 4-legged sliding robot. This mechanic feels great, really. You can strafe with small boosters and steer through tight spaces easily and your winch to pull down stuff on the map is awesome.   Story so far:  SPOILERS, maybe?   I'm still just in the beginning, but the main villain is Scarecrow(I love Scarecrow) and it's about his new chemical experiment(zombies, kind of?) and so far the interaction and cutscenes are pretty cool. I must say, it gets you in the story fast and keeps going like that as of now.     Graphics:  This game is beautiful. On High ofcourse. It does look good Low, but you can see the lack of details up close, especially on the batsuit. The rain/weather looks good enough to make a darker atmosphere. But as it is poorly optimized i'm running my game on Low still. Could go High, but too many frame drops in movement.   Memory:  It's a really RAM heavy game. I have 8Gb of RAM. While playing on Low and no AA. 3 Monitors, no programs other than Steam open. ~85% memory usage. Open Google Chrome, 95-100%. Just a heads up.  PS. Will edit as the game gets updates and I get further in the story.",

If your bored you can wander the streets like in a GTA game and cause havoc or in this case beat up some bad guys.   Now how does the game run. My GPU is NOT overclocked and I get 55+ FPS 90% of the time. I can only imagine a 970/980/TITAN to be way better.

However, I cannot recommend it to the majority of the people because this game is still suffering from serious performance issues. I am lucky that my graphics card is good enough to run this game on high settings at 60 fps. I think that WB should be sued for this. I mean seriously, an anticipated game like this, being so unplayable that most of the players can't play it after they bought this game for 60 bucks! Is this an Alpha or an early access? No, it's 3-4 months after release and Warner didn't even hesitate releasing it without playtesting (this game can't be testplayed...if they playtested it and said it would be good enough for the PC market, then WB should be sued even more).  On my PC (Intel core i5, Geforce GTX 970 [I got scammed there as well], 16 GB RAM) it runs smoothly...For the first hour...After one hour the NVIDIA driver starts to rampage and immensive framedrops occur. And I didn't even mention the funny part about this...NVIDIA supported this game with gamework effects and didn't notice that you cannot run this game on a high end PC with an NVIDIA graphics card at constant 60 fps. And I did not mention what happens if you activate gamework smoke. With my rig I couldn't play this game properly when smoke was activated.  What's even worse than releasing a broken game? Releasing it 4 months later without fixing all problems.  I hope that this will hurt WB and not Rocksteady.  In conclusion, I think that it is a good game. However, I don't think that you should give this bloody company your money.  ",

Cons: Game does not get steady 60fps with gtx 980 even on lowest settings(frequent drops to under 30 regardless). Game still hogs memory for no reason, and apparently the windows 7 memory leak was never fixed(i can't confirm this as i updated to 10) but it's something to be wary of.  Too many batmobile boss fights  Pros:  It's a pretty good arkham game, open world to explore with intersting things to do. Story is pretty telegraphed but as a batman fan it was still engaging enough for to keep my interest the whole time, and the voice acting and delivery for the most part was terrific. I felt the batmobile stuff was fine for the most part but the real fun in the game is flying around gotham city defying the laws of physics.  If you want arkham knight, get it at a discount or get a console and have the experience the game was designed for. 4 months off shelves and it's only moderately playable, you deserve better.  5/10",

Rocksteady really hit a grand slam with this. It has an even bigger grand scale than what it was in Arkham City. There is so much to do in this game that it will last you for hours on end. The story and all of the side missions are fantastic of course. All of the performances for this game were flawless with Kevin Conroy and John Noble. The Batmobile is also very badass and it is really joyful driving around gotham in it. But I still found myself flying on rooftops instead of driving the batmobile. The fighting in this game is better than every as well and they did a good job with creating the different sorts of enemies like the medic. One thing that slightly annoyed me about this game was the obstacles that you had to use the Bat-Tank to get passed them. But overall, this game met the hype, even surpassed it.

You are Batman and you alternate between jumping from rooftop to rooftop beating up random dudes and then having fisticuffs with crowds of jerks. Like Arkham City and Origins, it's still an open world sandbox game wherein Batman fights to protect a city that seems to be populated exclusively with dudes who are lining up to rob a bank or knock over a jewelry store. Seriously, besides one building of cops, a couple of firefighters and Batman's assorted sidekicks, the entire city is just a pack of dip♥♥♥♥♥. It makes you sort of wonder why saving it is even worth it in the first place.   Anyhow, that aside, the main innovation is you have the Batmobile, which is a tank thingie that's fun enough to use. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's not like the Batmobile segments aren't fun or whatnot.   The story meanwhile is pretty strong, although due to the comic book origins of the series it pulls a lot of punches. I think this is supposed to be the last of the Arkham games, so you'd think that the creators would be more willing to kill characters. I mean, it's not like if you kill them in this game they're deleted from the comic book forever guys. But in spite of that, there are some incredibly good scenes and I was very interested from start to finish. Some plot twists are presented a bit too obviously (the identity of the Arkham Knight is painfully obvious for about three hours), but most of it still comes together pretty solidly.   Until you get to the ending.   Or well, I should say 'Until you see what the ending involves'. Because in order to actually see what happens at the end you've got to collect every single mother♥♥♥♥ing Riddler trophy. All 250 or so of them.   I don't understand Rocksteady's obsession with those ♥♥♥♥ing things. Is it just a petulant idea that if you go through all this trouble making a big sandbox city that you ought to put ♥♥♥♥ around to make sure the player goes around appreciating all of it? Ugh.

The batmobile is an awesome vehicle, but it is overused like any great mechanic, the stealth for the batmobile in particular is what stands out as frustrating, but every other mechanic is perfected in this final installment. The fluidity of the combat, and the swiftness of the stealth. Batman has also never looked better, at launch the port was very incomplete, but now it runs quite well. Hopefully companies learn to put more effort in their pc ports, but only time will tell. At 30$ this game is a steal and I highly recommend it.   TL; DR Pros: +all of the gameplay +stellar voice acting +plethora of easter eggs for diehard fans +really detailed and beautiful world +updated graphics engine +improved port greatly since launch +replay value w/ side missions, riddler trophies, more challenges etc.  Cons: -Overused batmobile at end of the story -batmobile stealth -lack of boss fights -occasional glitches   Overall this is probably my favorite game of last year and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the previous entries in the arkham franchise especially if you want to see the conclusion of what happens after arkham city.

First, let me say that I pre-purchased the Arkham Knight Premium Edition back at the start of June due to the being a longtime Arkham-series fan, and had actually had my hopes up that this would be as phenominal a game as it had been advertised in previews/trailers.   When the game originally launched, I could barely play it, as it was so horribly unoptimized that I was one of the 90+% of people that had to use a community-discussion workaround to make it playable. After I did get it up and running, the framerates I got weren't the best, but the game was quite playable with some moderate frame drops in overly busy areas. I completed the main storyline and a good amount (but not all) of the side content, and was satisfied with the story. However, I knew this was not the game I paid for, and sat down to wait for Rocksteady and Warner Brothers to clean up the mess they let Iron Galaxy Games make of the pc version.   Over 3 months later, the September patch came out, and at that point I couldn't even launch the game due to changes they'd made in the patch. This infuriated me, even moreso due to the fact that the pc DLCs had still been held back and the console players were still enjoying their games while the pc community was still in patch limbo.  Another month later, just a few days ago, another patch is promised to be released... and what did we get? No major changes except that they allowed the cumulative DLC-backlog that the original game-owners were due to finally be recieved and played. All the bugs/glitches from September were still there, and I still couldn't even start the game. I was able to figure out my particular issue and get into the game again, but the damage was done. I'll play the DLC from what I'm still owed in the season pass, but I frankly don't have the heart to even bother replaying the game again.   This whole 4-month (and soon to be half a year at this rate) fiasco just reeks of incompitence and flat out apathy on the part of the developers. The pc version of the game should NEVER have been outsourced to a 3rd party to complete. The fact that Warner Brothers re-released the game in this state and offered people who purchase it all the prior Arkham games is just a flat-out slap to the face, as it literally amounts to nothing, since people will have probably already had purchased most if not all of those games.  In conclusion, I cannont recommend this game as it is at this current time. It's a shame that the conclusion to the Arkham series had to turn out like this; I enjoyed many of Rocksteady's games in the past, but now I'm leery of anything they produce in the furture for pc, as I don't know if it'll get outsourced again.",

The ball was raised extremely high up at that point, but then you get to the rest of the game. Between the nonsensical and downright boring padding thats added on after the main story, (which by the way adds about 10 extra hours to the game) and the lackluster narrative, Arkham Knight takes that highly raised ball, and slams it through the poorly-textured floor in its final acts. Not to mention the performance which is all over the place with my GTX 970, sometimes I get a consistent 45+ FPS, while other times it can go as low as 15 FPS in the span of 5 minutes. There also just isn't much to do, after the story you have the option of New Game+ or playing one of the five challenge maps they have to offer, that's it. In the end, I don't see how a game that took 4 years to make, and had multiple studios working on it, could only muster about 18 hours of actual gameplay to offer to consumers. I wouldn't recommend buying this at full price, let alone on PC. If you have to play it, borrow it, or rent it, as its not worth 59.99+ just for 18 hours of gameplay.

The other half, I have to tweak every graphical setting separately and reboot the game, praying it'll start up again. Otherwise, the game can and will crash.

I had recently owned the game before and the frames were jumping all over the place and had some pretty rough stuttering effects going on. Back then, I actually set the game to 30 FPS (most people consider this unacceptable) but I jump around from consoles to PC and honestly running the game on 30 FPS wasn't too bad for this title. So if you have a laptop/low-end PC, 30FPS was just fine. The Game itself is what you would expect from this franchise. Batmobile is a really nice touch, and the combat is always getting polished up. The DLC is really great. Now offers new challenges, bat suits, and batmobile skins. 1989 bat suit and batmobile, just awesome.

WARNING - MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!  =-=-=-=-=-=-=  This is very much like Arkham City in design, but RockSteady has added a few wonderful things to the mix which keep it fresh and new. The new suit lets you get around the city more quickly and the new Fear takedowns are fun, but the real beauty in this game lies in the addition of...wait for it...   ... the BatMobile.   *Disclamer: I am HORRIBLE at driving games. Utterly awful. Can't do it. Never could.  If there is one area where this game ***could** have fallen apart, the BatMobile and driving around the city is it. The open world game Mad Max had time trial missions that were almost impossible to complete and that robbed me of some of the enjoyment of the game. However, RockSteady has avoided every possible pitfall that I could think of with driving around in Gotham and has made the addition of the BatMobile another exercise in fun. If *I* can finish the driving challenges in this game, ANYONE can. The car-to-tank mechanic allows for easy maneuvering around tight turns and narrow areas, and the coolness factor of the car and the tank cannot be overemphasized.  Now for the negative: I did have to go to the controller for the driving time trials, as well as one of the side missions during the game. If, like me, you are a completionist when it comes to open-world games, you'll probably need a controller to get through everything.  Am I nitpicking? Pretty sure I'm nitpicking. Yeah, I think I'm nitpicking.  I've played through about 15% of the main storyline and some of the side missions, and I'm hooked. Great Riddler puzzles, lots of combat combos, all the good stuff you've come to expect from RockSteady's Batman games.  PROS ------ - All the good stuff you've come to expect from the Batman series - Great new suit - BATMOBILE!!!

The only reason I got this now was because it was about $35 on GMG at one point, yet I realize that was not the best decision. Right now, the game is barely even worth THAT. Hopefully these problems get fixed soon. For now, I would not recommend this game, not until it is fixed and actually playable.",

The gameplay is classic Arkham, with a number of neat additions. And blasting through Gotham in the Batmobile is a very satisfying experience, when the framerate doesn't tank into the ground.  As much fun as the game is, just wait until it gets fixed.",

When you load the game for the first time the first thing you will notice is the menus are capped at 30fps, strange I thought but I guess in game will be 60fps and beyond. The next thing I did was check the minimal amount of graphics options and ran the benchmark, first without the nvidia features on and was pleased to see the benchmark running at 60+fps, I then tried the various nvidia features to check for any dips in performance.  Then I selected new game and realised it was capped at 30fps which makes no sense considering the benchmark is at 60+, so I was forced to exit the game and edit the ini file in config to get 60fps. Unfortunately it looks as if right now I'll have to play the game capped at 30fps anyway, with the fps uncapped the stutter is worse than anything i've seen, the framerate fluctuates anywhere from 35ish to 60 when gliding and divebombing, I couldn't believe I payed £60 for this including the season pass.   This could be a worse port than AC Unity, I tested this on a single gtx 980 and SLI 980's, which made no difference to the framerate whatsoever.  This game needs a mammoth patch.",

To make it laughable, WD *promised* to fix the game with all the resources, the patch (28/10) did not do much with fixing the issues. While we did see some improvements, it is just not good enough. Still the same old crashes and still struggling to get to 60fps with gtx 970. Funny enough the included VRAM bar by the developer which is more like a sign of 'look don't expect too much from your gtx970 4gb (3.5gb to be precise) since the game is going to saturate most of the VRAM with normal setting so DEAL WITH IT'. Good luck with GTX 980 as well thou, check with the recent eurogamer to see why . The Nvidia gamework is never fully utilised. If this is what WD (or iron galaxy studio) can do the best for its PC port, well I fear for the future PC release from them .For hard-core batman fan and PC gamer, no, Batman Arkham Knight is not what we deserved.  So are there any redeeming features, well it is a very solid plot, gameplay mechanic and bat mobile is a tonnes of fun to drive with. For those who enjoy the past batman games, it is what you dream of, provided it works on your PC .

Come time to play, I only experienced minor lagging and after a few updates there were no more issues in the performance department. Nevertheless, the wait was worth it! Batman: Arkham Knight has everything you could have asked for with the colossal and dark Gotham City. The Batmobile is integral to the majority of the game but I'd say it struck the balance between gliding and driving just right (besides, those combat sequences in Battle Mode are a lot of fun and break up travel, and never unnecessarily). The Gotham City Police Department is the Batman's rock in this game where Commissioner James Gordon's character steps into the spotlight the most out of the rest of his appearances in the series. Nods to the previous titles involving certain villains are made and some new faces will come as a surprise. The beginning is eerie and the graphics throughout the game are the best I've seen in a superhero game. Batman: Arkham Knight dwells on the the theme of fear and shows us that fear in many ways isn't a weakness at all. It's the only thing that keeps us wary, not weary. In being aware, we're not really afraid at all, not even of who we are and what we've come to be. Batman: Arkham Knight may not be the best superhero game but there's no reason not to settle for being one of the greatest in a series of great superhero games.",

These issues are still prevalent even after the latest patch (re-release), and greatly detract from the game. Now that that's out of the way...  The actual game is fantastic. Even if you've played the previous games to death, the combat will still feel pretty fresh and rewarding. The story is also pretty good. When I finished the game I was kinda blown away by all the twists that are crammed into this game. If you are an avid Batman fan then you might be disappointed by where the story goes, but there are still many rewarding parts of the story for you. Some of the side missions do feel tacked on, but they will also surprise you in the best possible way - trust me! Perhaps the best part of this game is the presentation. Every scene in the game feels 'hand-crafted' in a way... Like the developers sat down and said, 'How can we make this look dank af?' They probably also had a similar discussion about the textures as they are extremely detailed. Even if you zoom in on objects their level of detail still holds up.   Too bad then that all this hard work goes to waste on the PC port. If there were a few stutters here and there, then I would be okay with it. But this game is plagued by stuttering and low frame-rates. It's disappointing that the actual enjoyment of such a stellar game can be marred by something that WB promised to fix so long ago, and that Nvidia should have picked up on after sponsoring the game with their new graphics cards. If you really want to get it on PC then wait until they actually fix it properly.  TL;DR: Great game, don't buy it on PC.",

But the game is excellent, it's not perfect, but it is fantastic. If you're a Batman fan and have played the others in the series, get this game now.   My only complaint (more nitpicks really) is that the Batmobile feels a bit forced in, I mean it makes sense, but it still feels a bit out of place in terms of controls anyway, in terms of the story it makes some sense, but it's controls are a bit odd. Partially due to the fact that you use it as a tank as well as the vehicle you get around the city with (which I think you can still glide and grapple around the city faster than the batmobile still, but anyway). The controls are not horrible or unbearable, it's just...different but kudos for trying.  All in all, Arkham fans, get this game.",

And I can say this with all honesty and little drama. In short, I can not reccommend this game at all. The quality and lack of concern mean it may never be resolved to a satisfactory standard. Nothing I have seen from WB is encouraging at all.  WB knew this game was not ready for release and did it anyway. Along with Rocksteady's collusion, I may add. As a cold buisness decision. And sadly this was not the first time they have done something of this like before and certainly not since, as those of us who bought the game are aware.  After a dysmal start, the reports are the patches 4 months after release are still not allowing the game to work properly, and the loyal customers who bought thus game along with season pass, have got nothing in goodwill but cold and frankly out of touch responses and gestures from Warner Brothers.  Nothing from the pre release, to the re-release so far, has much in the way of accountability. Such to the extent that by mid summer nothing surpised me about how poor the next course of action (or lack of it) would be. I just knew something was awful was going to happen next, it was just hard to predict what. That longer this saga has gone on, the worse it has gotten. This is way past turd polishing now.  WB have shown little interest resolving this, and making amends. Four months on and the game still does not work very well, and a token 'Gift' to owners of the game of a copy of each of the Batman Arkham games most of us already have. And WB surely know it.  Edit: Worth noting that many reviews have been listed as pre release, that have marked it down. They are in fact not pre release, but those who have bought the game at release in June 23 2015. So please be aware of this misconception.",

It's frustrating that you crash out of hard parts and need to start over from your last checkpoint. The game crashed for more than a total of 50 times and i am not being funny there, that's the minimum amount, it can't possibly be less. There are also small bugs during flights, you suddenly freezing or standing still for example. Or falling through an interior or world texture.  The game is great, the game is awesome.  I love the game, i am a big fan of the batman series. Never made a game me so angry while playing it, it is too damn bugged. I literally broke a key from my keyboard. Gotta buy a new keyboard now and that costs me more money than i had paid for the game which i Pre-order'd.  The game is a huge improvement from the previous Batman games. It's awesome that you get to use the batmobile now, you still solve riddles, crimes and keep doing the things you did in the previous batman games. The story is great, the graphics are great and so it the atmosphere. There are alot of easter eggs and funny things that you will find along the way while playing.  I would recommend the game for Playstation or Xbox but NOT on PC. The game is great, but the experience had been ruined for me.",

            "review_text": "Batman: Arkham Knight was nothing short of a trainwreck at release and remains today a bitter disappointment for me.  For starters I'd like to point out as a disclaimer that my general taste for the Arkham games may be a bit out of common bounds since I genuinely liked Arkham Origins and all it had to offer, so when I say that Arkham Knight is the worst installment in the series you can take this as by far the most subjective and biased statement in this entire review. Moving on.  I don't think there's much need to go what was the most glaring issue of this game for most of its post-release lifespan, the absolutely godawful performance and practically non-existent optimization. To summarize for those who somehow missed it, the game ran terribly, was locked at 30 fps (unlocking the framerate would at the time cause severe performance issues and bugs), and was in fact so difficult to run on even the most modern rigs that WB Games pulled the game altogether from Steam until they could manage to fix it - and that fix took a long time to come, with a blatant disregard for the few loyal consumers who got the game and its season pass since DLC for the PC version of the game was also significantly delayed.  But all of this is pretty much deprecated info left here for history's sake. The game runs well nowadays, albeit still suffers from a few FPS dips and it's a massive ram hog, but the opportunity of adding more RAM (up to 16gb) and a SSD fixed those issues in great part for me.  Performance issues aside the game does look stunning, and there isn't much to go against the general prettiness of the whole thing. It's consistent, the design of everything is great, some of its later sequences are legitimately breathtaking and it finally gets faces right for the first time in the Arkham series. As far as being a visual treat goes, Arkham Knight is legitimately one of the best looking games I've ever played both from a purely graphical and also a design standpoint.  Sadly there's a lot wrong with the game in ways that in my opinion far outweigh the prettiness of the graphics. So let's start with the two core mechanics of the game which have been the pillars of the series since the very beginning, combat and predator sections.  Combat which in my opinion was always the more interesting part of those two sections suffers in this game from feature bloating. Rocksteady said at some point that Arkham Asylum's gameplay was designed as kind of a rhythm game where Batman had to sync up his hits to the music and while that concept was thankfully scrapped the way the whole series builds its combat is obviously still based on that concept, and the difficulty comes from both keeping up a good pace and dealing with special enemies accordingly. However in Arkham Knight there's so many different types of special enemies that the player will actively spend more time performing really specific tasks to dispatch them than have fun just beating thugs up, to the point where the 'free' part of freeflow combat just kind of disappears. Alongside the returning types from AA and AC there's now electrified enemies who cannot be touched at all no matter the angle and must be hit with the batclaw to discharge the electricity and charging guys who can only be stopped with a batarang or by getting out of the way. This latter type of enemy also causes the camera to pan towards them so they're actually visible no matter what but it can also be fairly disorientating especially in more crowded fights. Finally there's enemies which have literally all of the above traits and these are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to deal with. They're huge, meaning they require beatdowns to take care of, they can switch to blades so you need to do the knife counter, they can electrify their fists forcing you to use the batclaw, and they can get shields - and they switch in less than a second which in theory would force you to stay on your toes but in reality only slows combat down to a crawl as you cannot possibly deal with them quickly.  Then there's the predator segments which frankly I've never quite enjoyed but this game really manages to make them far less fun than any of the previous titles. You very quickly start to run into enemies with heartbeat sensors, and disruptors which block access to detective vision on top of drone operators and a bunch of other stuff that kind of also force you to stop playing the game as you want and instead focus on really moving slowly to apply the same formula to the same types of enemies over and over again.  Speaking of upgrades there's some new stuff in there alongside the returning skills, notably the ability to lock and throw gadgets on enemies from a gliding position, although I've literally never used this because the situations in which it actually is useful are close to none, and it's not a really fun skill to operate in its weird implementation. Fear Takedowns are also a neat addition but only serve to simplify some aspects of the game further while encouraging exploits.  A lot of missions and side activities also revolve around tagging along with a second character, allowing for switching at will, and while it's a cool concept that works well on its own the complete inability to play any of them in free roam even though Arkham City had that feature is really weird and makes it feel unfinished.  There's a third part to Arkham games and that's the detective stuff. As far as this goes I thought AK was a bit weak since there's relatively few detective work involved due to something we'll talk about later. The few cases we get to go through and solve are pretty fun however and the Season of Infamy DLC does add a lot more investigating to the game which is a welcome change.  Now there's a new thing that the game added which every piece of promo material made sure to hammer home, and that's the batmobile. Put simply the batmobile is one of the most god damn annoying, shoehorned features I've seen implemented in a sequel in a very long time. At first the concept sounds neat and yes the car does control wonderfully well but the sheer quantity of missions and tasks that require the batmobile is so overwhelming that it really takes away from the experience and that whole feeling of 'oh crap I'm driving the batmobile' really becomes 'oh no I'm driving the batmobile again' before you reach the second half of the game. There's a lot to do with the batmobile, way too much in fact as nearly every single case, side-activity and story mission requires use of the batmobile at least once.  So what about the story ? Rocksteady hasn't exactly graced us with any groundbreaking storytelling up until this point and this doesn't really change much. Without spoiling anything in case you still want to experience it the whole thing revolves around a really, REALLY stupid concept and the recycling of old ideas done better in the comics or in other adaptations. It's not a good story by any means and the way it's told opens one new plot hole every mission.  As a final slap in the face story-wise the game locks away the true ending of the game behind 100% completion, and completing this game 100% is horrible due to one and ONE thing only; the god damn RIDDLER. This game has an ungodly amount of trophies to collect, a lot of which require the batmobile. Basically the riddler started as an amusing side activity in Arkham Asylum to slowly degrading into a horrible grindy mess.  Then finally there's the DLC practices. When this game first came out there was barely anything on side content and the dozens of brawl and predator maps that the previous titles had are now completely gone as the vanilla game had barely three or four maps instead. While DLC did a lot to add to that list, I as a customer was genuinely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the amount of content that the previous games had by default but that was locked here behind a paywall.  All in all I think Arkham Origins was a better game, and this one is best left ignored.",

The good news is, that's all here - the plot, combat and other elements are bigger and better than ever. So it pains me to give this game a bad score, and I'll explain why.  THIS GAME RUNS LIKE ♥♥♥♥. There it is, plain fact. Unlike the other games in the series, this one was handed out to an external port developer - never a good sign when you hear it's a multiplatform game - which goes some way in explaining the performance problems. Also, inexplicably for a pc title, it's locked at 30fps ingame (even though the benchmark tool is frame unlocked). The real problems many people have been reporting are to do with the texture quality, very limited and half-♥♥♥♥♥ graphics options, and frame rate issues (which are apparently caused by the restrictive Denuvo DRM the game sneakily enforces on you). I have a reasonably good PC, and was surprised to see that I couldn't even reach 30fps on normal settings (even though Arkham City reaches a stable 60 on max settings). This also ties to the texture quality issues - some areas, enemies and environments have disgustingly low resolution textures, even on the higher detail levels. How could the publisher release the game in this state? Graphically, the game looks like City but with added forced motion blur (which I have yet to find a way to disable) so it's surprising to see how bad it runs. Add to this the frequent stuttering when moving rapidly across the map (which given the size and detail, I can kind of forgive Rocksteady for).  So all in all, the game is a beautiful diamond in the rough clay of performance issues, DRM and lazy porting. I am quite disappointed, as the game's new additions - the batmobile, improved combat and flight etc. are brilliant. I would advise you to hold off buying this until they release patches to fix most or all of these issues. AND PLEASE, PLEASE REMOVE THAT STUPID 30FPS LOCK! WE ARE NOT CONSOLES, ROCKSTEADY!",

            "review_text": "Review will have spoilers for previous Batman games.  Story -   Even though the Joker, perhaps Batman’s greatest nemesis, has died, it seems the city has not evolved for the better with the disposal of the mad clown. Scarecrow has taken his place in order to demolish the entire city, instead of occupying himself with petty crimes. He has released a fear inducing neurotoxin all over Gotham City, making everyone go crazy and do whatever they can to run away from their (imaginary) fears.  When the city is evacuated, only Batman and a handful of law enforcers take up the fight against the city which is currently crawling with criminals. When Batman receives Intel from Oracle, commissioner Gordon’s daughter, that Ace Chemicals is the brewing spot of the toxin, Batman spares no effort in trying to stop the madman. Sadly, it seems another evildoer is out for Batman, who is also in cahoots with the dreadful Scarecrow. This mysterious figure is known as the Arkham Knight, who looks like a Batman copycat with a more ‘mecha-like’ suit.  The main plot of the game progresses in a fairly fast pace, if you solely concern yourself with the main quest. Overall the story feels like a theatrical experience.  Graphics -  Batman: Arkham Knight looks stunning. Whilst the city shows not that much life in the sense of many inhabitants running around, it does so in many other ways. You’ll be cruising through streets with buildings with heaps of details, great textures and a lot of the smaller obstacles are destructible. Whilst the latter may not sound that impressive, it shows a lot of interactivity with the city and even more, that the developers wanted their city to be alive.  Characters in the grim city look detailed, albeit that some enemies are overused. Batman and the main characters all look great, with the same dark vibe surrounding them. It seems the harsh existence has taken its toll on all the warriors of justice and this is quite clear with how everyone looks.  Overall the game aims for a very dark atmosphere and it more than succeeds in accomplishing that goal.   Sound -  With mood setting music, loud punch noises and enough explosions, the sound also does its best to set the mood. Whilst everything is already top notch, it will still be the voice acting that steals the show. The voice of Kevin Conroy will immediately be recognized by longtime Batman fans. As he has been voicing Batman on many occasions since the nineties, he is simply a top asset for the atmosphere of the game.  Gameplay/Combat -   Combat feels intuitive but also stiff at the same time. Punching your foes into submission and pulling off basic counters works quite well and will make sure the combat is rather fluent, while on the other hand the extra commands and combos feel annoying, as they are often only available for a very short amount of time. The same can be said for aerial attacks, as the command for the much appreciated attack does not always appear/trigger when you want it to.  Of course the game offers ample upgrades for you to choose from when you gain more experience. Like in many games, Arkham Knight works with different skill trees where you can choose new upgrades, combos or skills from. The options seem rather confusing at first, but after a bit of investigation they become easy to work with.   Conclusion - Recommended   Batman: Arkham Knight proves to be a great mix of gameplay, graphics and sound with a grand, yet grim, story-line that reigns supreme. Whilst the Bat-mobile proves to be an overused asset of the game, you’ll still find plenty of other things to do that will occupy you for hours to come.  Outside of the main objective there’s enough of side material for you to process. You’ll be able to ‘solve’ the Riddler’s puzzles, which is simply gathering collectibles and there will be other side quests available as well. Enough content if you’d rather level up a bit, before tackling the main problem at hand.  Truth be told, in many ways I feel as if this review is only scratching the surface of many areas in the game. That being said, I’d rather keep it a bit shorter for you to discover more about the gadgets, side quests and of course the main plot of the game.",

And then I booted up the game.. I played the first couple of minutes, ok so I saw some stutter, I thought, 'Maybe the game is just loading the massive world'...right?) It appeared it was already done loading... finally after some stuff in the beginning I could play as BATMAN, YAY! dived down from the edge, framedrop.. 'What?' , must be my imagination....So I kept gliding towards the designated point of interest... ok so far so good (I thought) , So eventually got to a cut-scene where Batman is talking, ok so that was kinda-ish smooth.. (NICE) , eventually I summoned the batmobile, HOLY CRAP! WEEEE, awesomecakes... jumped in.. the hell is this?! FPS drops everywhere... Didnt got any further into the game then around 80 minutes of playing the game..  But ladies and gentlemen Am I dissapointed in the experience so far... Why? This should've been THE best batman experience..Warner Bros, Rocksteady, you both dissapointed me and all the fans who have loved and supported your franchise over the years.... I thought you would've given this Batman game some extra attention.. But no... And why oh why, a port?! a freaking PORT?! gotta be kidding me.... and why the lock on 30FPS.. (yes I did push it already to 60fps in the .ini file) but why LOCK it...especially for PC users..that's just a massive torture (how come no single on/off switch in the main menu to put it on 60fps or not)..   I am gonna wait until a proper patch, if it hasn't been fixed, Ill definitely refund. I dont wanna refund, but if its nessacery I will do it....   Be ashamed for wasting so many fans their joy and let them wait for such a long time to exerperience the last batman game as they should.... deeply dissapointed. My next AAA game, no matter what company it is, Ill just wait for the reviews instead of instant buying it, it did leave a scar on my face. (please fallout 4.....please, be a proper game)  I suggest everyone that wants to buy this game.. don't buy until it's optimized.

I have played through Arkham Asylum and City and liked those fine, but this one just blew me away. The story is good as always on these and the usage of the Joker in the story is a smart concept.  The gameplay is as good as always but even with the more options to take out enemies or you can still kick ♥♥♥ the old fashioned way. I did something I never did on the other Arkham games is solve all of the Riddler puzzles. I just didn't want the game to end when I knew it was coming.

            "review_text": "It is such a shame that they boned the PC release of this game so hard, because Rocksteady is a solid developer and this is a great addition to the Arkham series. The symptoms of the terrible port still persist, although I would say that the game was about 80% okay for me. The biggest problem I had was that, in racing around Gotham in the Batmobile, the game is forced to load tonnes of textures incredibly quickly, and when it failed to do so fast enough it would freeze and think for about 10-15 seconds before resuming again. Because a lot of the driving requires very fast reflexes, this could at times cause considerable frustration, and unfortunately this happened almost entirely one the first island, which soured my initial opinion. Other than this though, there was really only the occasional noticable bug that didn't get ironed out as the QA manpower was diverted elsewhere during the release crisis. This game was rightly made an example of, as WB's despicable release deserved no forgiveness from consumers, however it's a shame that it had to screw over what is actually a really good game by a really good developer.   Now, beyond all that, let me say that this is one of the best looking games ever made. I read a debate on this topic that argued between this game and Star Wars Battlefront, and while Battlefront is all style and no substance, Arkham Knight has more than enough substance to satiate those coming from Arkham City. It again ups the ante over its predecessors and delivers the entirety of Gotham for us to play around in, and while Arkham Origins ostensibly did the same, Rocksteady actually managed to fill the space with character. The sheer amount of time that must have been spent on the art of this game is absolutely mind-boggling. Almost every inch of the city feels specifically crafted rather than copy-pasted, and on top that there're dozens of unique indoor locations to boot. The NVIDIA enhancements are pretty stunning too – the way the rain plumes off of your cape as you leap into flight never gets old - although most of them will test your hardware.  In regards to gameplay, it’s much the same as the previous games, with a few new gadgets here and there. I'd heard a lot of complaints about the amount of Batmobile in the game, and I personally can't really see where the negativity has come from. The Batmobile combat isn't the most elegant, but neither is the hand-to-hand combat. Although I quite enjoyed travelling around in it, it can also be abandoned for the majority of the game, and travelling on your own is a viable alternative when you level your skills up enough. In short, I didn't find it to be an unwelcome addition to the game.  This is the fourth Arkham game though, and there are signs of the franchise tiring. The Riddler’s riddles felt lazier and many literally spelled out the answer in the riddle itself, many of the villains make their third or fourth appearances and really started to feel recycled, and the combat system seemed (at least at the beginning) even more self-guiding than before. Some of the tasks also seemed more like busy work than before, but that might be a related to the sheer amount of them they've used to fit the size of the city, as well as my own personal weariness of the 'open-world formula'. In saying that, the story is genuinely intriguing and I can't seem to put the game down. I played 21 hours in the first 2 days at a time where I was getting burnt out really quickly with other games, and I’d often find myself saying ‘one more mission’ until it was 3 in the morning.   TL;DR - This is a great sequel to Arkham City, and exposes the fact that, while they own the franchise, in developing Arkham Origins WB didn’t actually understand what made an Arkham game so good. AK continues to keep the core gameplay intact whilst expanding the scope of the game, however, I can't see them being able to expand any further from here on. I can’t see them creating a bigger game world, or doing much more with the established gameplay, or using the same characters again without it all seeming tired. I haven’t finished this yet, and perhaps the plot gives it away, but I hope they don’t keep bashing out endless games in this vein, because I don’t know if there’s much more of the well to draw from in this same way. If this is the swansong of the series, it’s a shame that the release was such a clusterf**k, and as a consequence has scarred the game permanently. If you can get it cheap in a good sale, like I did, I highly recommend it, but I wouldn’t pay full price, as despite the fact that it's a great game, it’s still broken in a number of ways.",

Anyway, about the game itself:  + Bigger and it can be even more good-looking than Arkham City. Emphasis on CAN though, because the PC graphics settings are still downright awful. + Gliding has been expanded greatly and it's even more fun. Ejecting yourself from the Batmobile to reach the skies never gets old. + New gadgets and tricks to neutralise enemies and strategically plan your attacks. + The hallucinations are great, especially   the Joker's   monologues are hilarious.  + Subtle changes and funny Easter eggs in Gotham City due to   being exposed to Fear Gas  . + Dual play combat was fun.  +/- Fear Takedowns were cool, but like Knock-out Smashes they give away your position. So unfortunately if you like using stealth to remain unseen and unheard for the entire section, it's not the best option. +/- Even though the Batmobile is a fresh and exciting addition to the series, it's getting shoved down our throats rather a lot. At least half of the time it wasn't necessary.   - Main story is heavily disappointing and underwhelming, I thought all the super villains were working TOGETHER to hunt down the Bat. Turned out it's pretty much every man for themselves again. - The secret and mysterious identity of the Arkham Knight was painfully obvious after   Batman starts to hallucinate about   a certain individual. - Side quests are forgettable, except for the Opera missions. - You're being forced to do uninteresting side quests to unlock   Operation Knightfall  , the game's ending. You even have to collect all ~250 Riddler trophies and riddles to unlock the full ending. - I'm not a fan of the ultra gritty redesigns of some characters, I preferred Asylum and City's 'comic book realistic' designs.  When all is said and done, it's a good game and definitely worth buying in normal circumstances, but I still don't recommend this PC version in its current state.

If dev teams were encouraged to creat exceptional content instead of sell copies and season passes, this game could have been amazing. Instead, it's passable.  Side note: if modders can enable PC players to freeroam as any playable character within days of its launch, RS should have been able to do it on all platforms, and hiding behind a thin veil of 'being Batman' is a miserable excuse.",

Making the AR Missions and Mission Objectives bound to the D-Pad was a terrible idea.

The identity of the Arkham Knight turns out to be the super-obvious answer even though the devs denied that said character was going to be the Arkham Knight. It's like Khan in Star Trek: Into Darkness. The creators straight-up lied to their audience to cover up their own lack of creativity. That's called contempt.   The worst part is that the core Arkham combat/exploration is as solid as ever and the shiny new graphics are really impressive, but it's so buried beneath layer after layer of sub-par design choices and execution that it's really not worth the time nor money unless you're 8 and really don't know any better.

Theonly thing I can recommend is you dont buy it from a retailer, get your refund and go pick it up cheap at a key reseller. Thats where I bought my Premium edition for $45. I dont have the choppy performance others speak of, but with all the missing textures, a team of 12 working on it, and everything else that is wrong, just dont get it unless you get it for cheap.     I am kind of mixed on the game. I have to recommend it though because my problems were not as severe as others are reporting, and I went around and played in the .ini to try to both improve and break the game. Testing results below, system spec to follow.   Intel i7 3770K 3.5 GHz overclocked to 4.5 GHz 16 GB Corsair Vengeance 1600 MHz EVGA GTX 980 ACX 2.0 Superclocked Asus P8Z77V-Pro Motherboard and an assortment of harddrives that I dont want to post because lazy, but they're rated sata 3 6BG/s.    Yes there are all the issues people spoke of. I had only minor issues - drops down to 30 fps from 60 after editing the .ini file. Of course I only edited the FPS cap on the .ini at first. I explored it some more and there are alot more settings hidden behind there, and the vast majority are disabled by default. Near the bottom of the system settings you can find the 4 major nvdia gameworks options all disabled by default, funny I had them enabled in the in-game settings.....  There were some more shader options in there disabled as well as other AA options. I turned most to true and back to the game, and yes there was some visual improvements, I havent seen any paper to run through or smoke to make a bataring hole in yet to test the others. I swear the rain was whicking off the cape, then again it could be the haze of the smoke right at this moment too... more testing required.   Aside from the above the game itself is still good, the combat, the batmobile, the story has me intrigued. Classic Batman action from Rocksteady, but honestly wait for it to go on sale or until they patch it to make it easier to manipulate the settings and get the shaders working properly. Well actually not to push other sites, but check websites for some resellers, I picked up the premium edition for $45 CDN, so I mean, I am not to upset for how the game is playing vs what I paid.",

I AM NOT THE BATMAN  Skip reading until the updates... At first I liked it, then it crapped out  SO far, so good. I have been playing for a little over an hour and right off the bat (ha ha ha, ok I'll show myself out) I like it better than the previous games. The batmobile is cool, I didn't realize there would be a crazy war mode for the car too! The graphics show a bit of improvement over the last game. I'm running 2x GTX780's in SLI with all settings maxed out. FPS were good at first when I took off the cap. I assume the gameplay will be the saem as all the others, 'go here, do this, beat them up, bring that here blah blah blah' but I don't mind it. I got mine for 40% off (not from steam) so that's even better.  UPDATE#1 SO I got another chance to play it today and I can now see why people are crying about the frame rates. Yep, sometimes they are terrible but it's usually when the batmobile is in the picture. I'm not mad about it though, it's still a fun game.  UPDATE#2 Had another chance to play tonight and now I'm changing it to not recommended. I read that WB is suspending the game sales until it's actually fun to play more than 60% of the time. I got far enough tonight to really start driving the bat mobile in the city and the fps drops so much and so low that's almost funny. I stopped even trying to monitor them because it just makes me sad when I see a '5' in the top right of my screen (fraps). Also had my first crash, some fatal error related to Wwise, I don't really know why....... of course, while driving the bat mobile.  I still think it's fun and has a lot of potential to be a good game. So far the story is pretty cool and the bat mobile is awesome to drive (besides the horrible performance). For everyone yelling 'conspiracy' about how WB is only working on it because of steams new return policy.... well, it's not just steam. Green Man Gaming is offering to refund people if the first patch doesn't make it playable. So it seems like the general consensus is that the people who made this game better fix it or they will be screwed.  I'll wait for the first patch but if it doesn't significantly improve the performance, I'm returning it to get my money back and I probably won't buy it again because of the bad taste in my mouth.

            "review_text": "Oh boy. Batman Arkham Knight, the fourth in the Arkham series and the third developed by Rocksteady, this is without a... incredibly dividing game. When this game was released back in June 2015, it was a more disasterous launch than the Challenger shuttle. The framerate was ♥♥♥♥, glitches were everywhere, and the PS4 had better graphics than the max version. Numerous people have put this on their 'Worst of 2015' list because of this. So. What do I think of this atrocious excuse for a game?  It was pretty good. Not my GOTY, but I think it would be in my top 10 of 2015. Now, before you crucify me, just hear me out, alright? Put the gun down... HEY, PUT THE DAMN GUN DOW...  STORY: You are Bruce Wayne, AKA Batman. After the death of The Joker in Arkham City nine months post-Arkham City, crime rates have declined in Gotham and it seems that things are normal. However, The Scarecrow threatens to unleash his fear toxin upon Gotham, causing the city to evacuate and for Batman to get back into his suit and go after him and restore peace to Arkham for possibly the last time. However, a militia lead by the Arkham Knight, a villian who nobody knows anything about, has teamed up with Scarecrow, causing things to be more difficult than they would usually be. The story is alright, it isn't as good as it was in City IMHO, but it was better than Origins.  GAMEPLAY: Combat is refined, it feels better than it did before. Stealth is there, and it feels more viable. Still, it feels awesome to beat thugs up, and while that still is an option, it is a bit harder of one than before. There's a new FEAR takedown system, which lets you take out up to three thugs (five with upgrades) before you go into combat. There are medics now who revive enemies you knocked out and give existing enemies a boost, take those out ASAP or else it will be harder to deal with. The usual thugs from the last games are there, too. Boss battles are fine, nothing as awesome as the Mr. Freeze battle, but it's fine.  We also have the Batmobile now, and let me tell you... eh, it's alright. It isn't as awesome as I wanted it to be, it feels a bit lighter than it should have been, but at the same time, I don't get where people are coming from when they say it's terrible. It's pretty fun, and I liked using it.  GRAPHICS, PERFORMANCE, AND LEVEL DESIGN: Okay, let me say this first and foreforth: I don't know if anyone else will have better luck with a different rig. That said, I had no issues at all. None. I think that all of the issues are fixed as far as I can tell. Graphically it looks amazing too. And don't go all 'But dog, it looks better on PS4, nyeh!' SHUT UP! It still looks good. So shut up. Gotham looks good, it has a lot of details to it, all three islands are nice to be around. The open world looks nice, there are a lot of cool places to explore, and I can't complain  CHARACTERS, VOICE ACTING, AND DESIGN: Batman is voiced by Kevin Conroy like the last couple times, and he does a good job. Scarecrow is played by one of the guys from Fringe, he's spooky as hell and is the best voice actor in this whole thing. The Joker also kinda has a role in this, and Mark Hamill still kicks ♥♥♥. Other than that... well, it's kind of weird. I mean, the voice acting is top notch, but it seems kinda emotionless. Kinda hard to explain. Character design still looks good, no complaints there.  SIDE ACTIVITIES: You're Batman, you got a lot to do. Save firemen, save Catwoman from the Riddler, ♥♥♥♥ around with the Arkham Knight's militia's stuff. Some are better than others of course, I get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the thought of doing the Riddler trophies and challenges, but ah well. There are also the AR Challenges that you can play, if you're into those, you can play them.  FINAL VERDICT: I don't blame you if you're still a bit butthurt about the performance issues day 1, but it shouldn't cloud your judgement of this game. 8/10, if you like the Arkham games, or are a big Batman fan, it's now $40 off sale, I grabbed it when it was $24. If not, maybe wait for a future sale where it's off more.     How many more bones would you crush? How many lives will you destroy in pursuit of what you call justice? You are the product of everything you fear; Violence, Darkness, Helplessness... All that remains is for you to watch as I drag your beloved Gotham into oblivion.   ",

A lot better... but still only acceptable. It's definitely in a playable state tho. The FPS in the game ranges from 10-20 in 'over the city views' (which are very rare) to stable 55-60 on foot and during fights. Batmobil drops the FPS a bit (45-55).. apart from some occasional drops it's fairly stable. I'm playing on Normal Graphics settings with Gameworks turned off.  My PC doesn't even pass the 'recommended' settings, so i would say it's pretty okay. However - the fact that other triple A games run much better on my PC is the reason for my 'acceptable performance' statement. Another thing you should prepare for are crashes. They seem to occur more often the further you progress.  I had about 10-15 crahes in total during my playtrough while most of them were during solving Riddles for the 100% completion. I was about 75% into the Story when i had my first crash. The rest of them was during mentioned 100% completion which you need if you wanna see the ending. ----  Now that we are done with this, let's start with the review of the actual game. Graphics are gorgeous, the story is one of the best of the series, batmobil feels like a batmobil should feel like. The combat is more fluent and responsive than ever (excluding the Red Hood DLC more about that later). Only the Environmental takedowns and the 'knock guy with shield down' doesn't seem to work sometimes.  Locking the 'real' Ending behind a 100% (or 120%) completion may seem annoying at first but makes sense. This is the last game of the series and if you follow the story you will understand why. Just make sure to be bring a lot of patience with you - especially when you are about to solve all of the 243 Riddles.. yes.. 243! Took me 3 days.  The DLCs for Batman (the extra 20%) are nice, introduce some known villians and can really be seen as fan-service for the fans of the Arkham series.   The Arkham Episodes (playing as different character e.g. Batgirl, Harley, Red Hood etc.) are sadly a bit too short. Most of them can be done in about 15-30 minutes. The only longer on is Batgirl which takes about an hour. The Red Hood DLCs introduces some nice new combat moves and style but seems to be a bit clunky. Sometimes Red Hood was just standing there for 1-2 seconds after a takedown or special move not letting me control him while being beaten to death. Apart from that just another load of Fan-service for DC and Arkham lovers.  Overall i would say it's a recommended purchase. You get loads of content, especially if you like to collect stuff.. The performance issues are mostly fixed at least to an acceptable and playable state. DLC and Arkham Episodes are just awesome.

Yo no compré el Pase de Temporada porque el único DLC que vale la pena comprar es el Season of Infamy, con 4 mini campañas entretenidas y con estas, puedes ganar el juego al 240% y desbloquear un nuevo traje.",

Pros:  - If you can somehow run the game, like I can, it still plays just fine, until memory issues happen and you have to restart the game. I've only had to do this once, and I'm 3/4ths of the way through the game.  - Even with missing visual effects, it is still a very pretty game, even if it doesn't hold up as well to other recent games.  Wait until the issues are fixed to purchase this game on PC. Otherwise, get it for PS4.",

            "review_text": " While a good game on its own, Arkham Knight doesn't quite satisfy in terms of being a worthy conclusion to the series. It is still a great game on its own, providing plenty of high-quality, polished gameplay, that I can recommend without hesitation.   A good open world game as far as mechanics and execution go, AK does many things right. The Gotham City is probably the best crafted one in the series, allowing for convenient exploration both on foot and inside of the Batmobile. The side missions are fed to the player at a great pace, allowing for logical and nearly seamless dipping between the side stuff and the main story. What enhances this quality is the fact that many of the side missions require the player to wait. The antagonists leave trails or establish their positions as the story progresses, some objectives are impossible to achieve until Batman can bring in his car to a specific island of the city and, probably my favourite part, many of the missions require you to notice sound cues and follow them. This is quite brilliant, making some of the side-stories to appear more naturally, instead of magical markers showing you everything you need to know. Overall, the open world aspect is fantastic with the exception of Riddler trophies, which are probably the most tedious one in the entire series; a surprise, given that a fair few of them were unexpectedly clever. Sadly, the majority is just an annoying busywork and locking a side-mission conclusion beyond getting 100% of them, while traditional for the series, pains me so much more this time. Needless to say, I lacked the patience to do this.  The gameplay lives up to the high standard set by the design: combat is the smoothest, most dynamic yet, not afraid to throw tonnes of enemies that require old and loved tactics to overcome; but also introducing a few new ways of dealing with the peskiest of adversaries. While the combat received slight polish when compared to the older games, the stealth is where the true revolution happened. Fear Takedowns are a fantastic and satisfying tool, with an interesting balancing mechanic of recharging after stealth takedowns, an action much harder to perform after inciting panic among the enemies. Several gadgets received new functions, uniquely tuned against the new opposing forces, broadening the possibilities of the player. Mobility in stealth sections was improved as well, opening the areas for a much more interesting design.   The variety is further built upon with the most notable toy of them all: the Batmobile. I didn't find myself hating it, personally. It makes exploration faster and brings player's attention to the ground level, which holds some of the surprises, and the usual combat feels good. Not as great as the on-foot fighting, but the hordes of enemy drones do introduce a proper combat dynamic. Car chases, however, get old after just a few of them, and it doesn't help that one of the classic enemies was included for a little bit of a different flavour in a few chases. They just got barely anything going for them, boiling down to a long drive and waiting for when you can hit the attack button again. Once. The boss fights, when in the car, have a similar problem: they are either an exercise in frustration, dragging for far too long or both. I much preferred Riddler racing tracks which, despite requiring a lot of repetition to get them damn perfect for the challenges, served their purpose well and actually amused. Similarly, the new traversal options and weapons contained within the Batmobile breathed some fresh air into the 'riddles'. Overall, a great addition.  Now, just like the open world was great, the story is... well. Forgettable might not even cut it. It has some moments that surprise, but over the course of the hours, it becomes blatantly obvious that the person in charge of writing the story had no idea what to do with it. Scarecrow is completely wasted, coming off as a weaker, bland and lacking villain who basically just rambles on about everything. His appearance in Asylum was more impactful than the leading role, that is how bad it is. The trend of bad storytelling is taken further with the titular Arkham Knight. While an expected nod to the comics, he comes and goes without much of an impact. Definitely a missed opportunity there. Shockingly, the side missions are written much better, at least some of them. For every intriguing, emotional little bit, there is an episode that is short, unengaging and its absence wouldn't hurt the game one bit. And that is on top of half the rogue's gallery having 'revenge' as the sole reason for being in the game. I expected better of these characters, and the game has some of them taken to proper depth. We are even given unexpected and daring conclusions to two of the well-established villain's stories, something I enjoyed seeing and continues the tradition introduced by the ending of Arkham City. Overall, writing is mixed, but the main plot disappoints severely.  And yes, even on a decent setup the game still has hiccups during Batmobile sections, but it is nowhere near unplayable. GTX 970 kept me on 60 FPS most of the times with driving stages dropping, at worst, to 45 FPS.",

Be warned, you will still need a beefy PC to pull this off.  As far as gameplay goes, it's much of the same from the previous Arkham games. Except for the Batmobile, which is foisted upon you regularly - dare I say I enjoyed the Batmobile bits for what they were worth.  The storyline certainly goes through peaks and troughs but overall it sets a captivating backdrop for all of the Bat-shenanigans and keeps you driving forward to the conclusion.  Visually, the Arkham universe has never looked better, and there's plenty to do to help you explore every nook and cranny.  Overall, the general criticisms you will read levelled toward the game itself (forgetting the technical issues) are warranted. If you consume the game in bursts you will likely not grow weary of the myriad gameplay beats and eke out many hours of Bat-joy.   Definitely a must-play for fans of the Arkham series.",

The game looks absolutely beautiful - the graphics are really good, the art direction is fantastic, I really have no complaints.

Wasted characters and gameplay opportunities, 2nd-rate story arcs, not to mention the overuse of a unique concept (Batmobile) just render the game as “lukewarm”  X4) The underusing of Harley Quinn in this game is ludicrous. Rocksteady knows how to make micro-campaigns, a “Blood Dragon-esque” campaign for Harley Quinn-fans would have easily made shovel-loads of money and saved the game from its lukewarm reception  To Fellow Harley Quinn-enthusiasts:  Rocksteady made a big deal about our favorite psychiatrist in black &amp; red tights being playable, but she is vastly underused to the point that I asked myself, “Why even give her a ‘Story Campaign’?” She is fun to play as in AR Challenges; but this is no Mega Man X’s ZERO Micro-campaign, rather a cheap, unfulfilling promise to many of us who want to play a Harley Quinn starred Action-game (even if it is a Micro-campaign)  Verdict: If you want to play another Arkham-style game, this is an option. It is no magnum opus like Arkham City or well-crafted experience like Shadow of Mordor. If this is your first Arkham-style game, you may love it; but to other fans of the genre it really is just indifferent when compared to the other titles",

This time it ran smoothly and worked properly. Even with my average PC.  This game is extraordinary. Overall, great performance, stunning graphics and a speechless story. This game was not rated positive since the first release, but now my comrade, this game is more than great. This game made me addicted, and I had to play it despite finishing the story twice. The main story, the side quests and free roaming are what you should expect from such a game, and the game delivered.  You have so many choices. For instance you can choose different skins on batman and the batmobile and various persons. There are also other opportunites like races, stealth missions. For me, this batman game got it all.  I've played the other batman games, but this must be the best. I found the combat, the batmobile and all the other things amusing and better than the other games, but that is my opnion.  As you can see, this game is breathtaking. RECOMMENDED!",

Most of my frustrations came from those types of missions, but they weren't too hard; just slightly annoying.  Overall I feel this game lives up to any expectations I might have had for a sequel to Arkham City. The mere size of the game world is almost inconveivable. It's so much larger than City and there's so much more to do. The side missions (Known as 'Most Wanted') are practically made part of my story. There's so much more in this game period.  The story was a lot longer I felt than the other two games which I appreciated. It was extremely immersive and satisfying.   All-in-all, I really enjoyed this title and it's my personal favorite in the series. 10/10",

The graphical details and destructible environment are technically suburb and on par with next generation graphics playing on the PC. I think Batman causes more mayhem in Gotham City than the thugs trashing it. The awesome new Batmobile is a beast driving through the city. There is a certain rush watching concrete pillars crumble as you crash into them and wiping the streets clean with the Batmobile smart rocket launcher. The Batmobile is the smartest and fastest hybrid tank on wheels ever created or imagined, smashing everything that stands in its path. This game is super fun and does live up to its name.

            "review_text": "This is an OUTSTANDING Arkham game, but it comes with a very big IF...  ...If you can run it without issues. I was one of the lucky ones, I guess, as I was able to play the game on my system (MSi Dominator Pro GT60 2pe w/ 8GB Geforce GTX880M and 24GB RAM) from day one and did not have any of the issues that others had (though I did have to turn off the smoke physics and debris physics to get playable framerates). A lot of people did not have such luck, and so this game has rightly got a lot of negativity.  But, if it does run well enough on your machine, then you are in for a treat, because this is a great continuation and completion of the Arkham games saga. Batman still batmans like a BATMAN! BECAUSE HE'S BATMAN! The fighting is just as smooth and excellent as it was in Arkham City (and lacks whatever tweaks ruined the flow in Arkham Origins), the Batmobile, while overused, is a lot of fun. The story is great. The side missions are great. The Riddler stuff is tedious, but that's kind of expected at this point, and it has a pretty good pay-off in terms of the satisfaction of beating that jerk. ;)  So, yeah, I am recommending this game, but with that huge caveat: it may not run well on your system, and so you may end up having wasted your money. Only buy this if it is at a price point at which you don't feel it would be a waste if your machine can't handle it now (and don't buy it all if you don't ever expect to have a machine that can play it well). Or maybe consider getting the console version (though if you are like me, you may prefer playing Arkham games with kb/m) which is at least guaranteed to run.  But, if you do get it, and it does run on your machine, then you are in for a treat. :)",

(*Important*) However I will say that if you want to play this game, you had better have a middle to high-end pc if you want it to be optimum. The frame rate fluctuates like crazy while playing with or without v-sync. I was able to get around 50-80 frames (without v-sync) at any given time but I definetely noticed frame drops, especially while dive bomb gliding. All in all if you have a good pc i reccommend this game, but otherwise I would stay away from it until you get a better one.

In-game settings:  Texture on max (or normal, as they call it) Shadows on low (this seams to be the most taxing feature on my graphics card, i can feel the difference if the shadows set even on medium) Anti aliasing on. V-sync off (I uncapped the frame rate as suggested on many forums) I disabled all nvidia special features except paper debris.  So far game runs fine with occasion frame drop. I bet the problem will go away if I lower the texture quality, but I'm sucker for high res textures, so am willing to sacrifice some performance for the quality.  As the game goes, it's pretty good, looks beautiful, fist fights as good as ever. The only thing I don't particularly enjoy is bat-mobile, I wish they included much less of it in the game. Big change as well, you don't get experience points for random street fist fights, which is a little disappointing.  My personal rating is 7/10.

When I was first learning the game, when I wanted to go into detective mode I called the batmobile. When I wanted to go through grates I had to hit B instead of A. Not to mention the menues you had to hold down the dpad and then make your selection. That really frustrated me to no end at the beginning. But as the game progressed, and as I assimilated to the new scheme, I thought this was a legitamate upgrade compared to the older games.  The batmobile I loved. I wished they incorporated the batwing as well like in Origins.  I have a problem with the ending. I don't want to spoil it, but there are two ending, one through the story mode, and then one 'bonus' one after you completely finish the game. It's definitely an end, and makes sense if this is going to be the final edition to the Arkham series. But it is still hard to swallow.  Very good game. I thought it was the best in the entire series for sure. But don't underestimate the previous three games. They lay a foundation of the storyline in this game.  Great game.

Also, some of the supporting character's scripts/decisions/actions make no sense whatsoever, they seem to be conveniently accomodated just so the story follows the desired path.  The gameplay is great because its predecessors, but anything new added to the game is a huge let down. The batmovile is, in my opinion, the greatest missed chance of this game: aside from the cool graphics and the impecable ambiance, all the gameplay in the batmovile feels like an early 90's arcade game. The boss fights are also very dissapointing, they seem uninspired and repetitive.

The graphics and mechanics were as great as I was expecting and even a little more with the seemingly ability to do anything you wanted as the batman.   I have heard of many reports of glitches and errors however the only ones I found were ones already present in the other games (e.g. bodies merging with walls). I also did not experience any crashes or frame drops using the batmobile.  The batmobile felt amazing to me to use and fluent to drive. The ability to switch from pursuit and attack mode so easily was great. I was expecting the batmobile to be a cheap gimmick to boost sales of the game however, I found my self driving more than actually flying as I was having so much fun with the car. The fight sequences in the car were also great and I felt I won off pure skill.   The combat system in this game was just amazing. Being able to just move so much more fluent was so amazing. What also made things great was the increase of special takedowns (Batmobile and enviromental). These made the game fell really fluent but as well make it look really cool. I believe its hard to deny the fighting in each game gets better with ever new release (including Origins), it just makes me sad this is the end of the series. Some of my favourite combat moments were with companions which to me made it feel even more fluent but as well made it look so cool. They truly did much better than expected with that mechanic.   Spoiler Warning:  The story for me was great in how it presented batman in the continuing struggle between himself and joker. I really enjoyed flying around the city to find the joker sitting and monologuing about something. The ending of the campaign where you run around as joker in a destroyed world that was great and was an absolute find screw at the same time. Ultimately, the story was great with nice little easter eggs from preivous games scattered around the place. My only negative part of the story was with how they dealt with deathstroke. That was soooooo dissapointing. It was so anti-climatic when all it took to take out deathstroke was to destroy the tank. Here was the game creator's chance to redeem themselves of deathstrokes poor portrayl in origins and they just made it into a crappy side quest. The fight sequence should have been the most over the top destruction fest where it truly felt like there was a lot at stake.   Ultimately I thought this game was epicly compelling, visually, mechanily and story-whise. The game compelled me to go back and play the older titles and to play it over and over again.",

I ran it with an overclocked Radeon HD 7850 with 1 GB VRAM and 8 GB RAM, which should not be sufficient by a long shot seen the official system requirements. But it ran smoothly at around 30 FPS at 1920x1080 Resolution and Graphics mostly on Low, but Textures on Medium (which officially requires 3 GB VRAM!). I didn't have any issues. So in my experience, the game is technically rather solid (at least as long as you are okay with 30 FPS, which I am).  Now to the Game itself: The parts where you're running and flying around and doing things without the Batmobile are as good as they ever were, and the level design sometimes was really good. However, I found the formula getting a bit stale at this point after having played all the three other games, but then again, this is a sequel and I guess I cannot expect too much innovation.  Then there are the Batmobile tank fights and Batmobile stealth sections. Driving itself feels fine, and fighting and predator stuff seemed fun at first, but got repetitive and annoying pretty quickly. And all this is so out of character: Batman driving a Tank, shooting at people, cars and tanks and wrecking the city (regardless of the fact that some shy elves seemed to rebuild everything after Destruction-Batman left the scene). They had a big part in me finding the atmosphere lacking in this game compared to its predecessors.  The story and storytelling and characters aren't very inspired either, to say the least.   I found the story inane, implausible and forgettable.  They tried to tell a more personal story, but it lacked heart. This Batman is one of the most ridiculous over the top bad4ss Batmans ever that even 'All Star Batman'-Frank Miller would be ashamed of it. This Batman hardly ever shows any emotion. Though the whole story is about loss and family and the need to rely and trust others etc., it left me cold. Batman seems just so emotionless, full of himself and odious even to the people he is supposed to like.   The villains I found bland, especially compared to the other Arkham games. No real bossfight anywhere in the game's main story, although I have to admit that I liked the final confrontation with the Arkham Knight. It just isn't a real boss fight either. I am absolutely happy not to have a bossfight, but in a Batman game with clear villains, this seemed very anticlimactic.  So story-wise, this is the worst Batman game in my opinion, all grandiosity and spectacle and no heart.  I also felt like it had less 'Batman atmosphere', at least compared to Arkham Asylum, which is my favorite anyway.  Of the few side missions I played, some seemed good, but the majority I found rather to be repetitive busywork. I dislike that they didn't really feel optional like in the predecessors, as Alfred constantly bullied to please do some of the side-missions 'the developers worked so hard to put all that open world Ubisoft crap in there so please Please PLEASE play that, why wouldn't you now Master Bruce?'; and more importantly because you have to complete quite a considerable part of them to 'finish' the game in the sense of playing until you see the credits roll and have a satisfying conclusion. No thanks.  Despite all this critism, fun can still be had in this game, as the core mechanics still work and are fun, and all the other things that made the predecessors good games are mostly still here, but on the other hand they often feel like they are overstaying their welcome. But ultimately, there are in my opinion too many weak and annoying parts to recommend Arkham Knight. For me, this was not worth the time I invested in it.",

The rain effect is ever present, at first it looks great, but you later come to find it somewhat distracting. Sadly all of the NVIDIA gameworkshop special effects will either crash the game or cause it to run below 10FPS.  Gameplay: Exactly the same as all 3 previous versions only slightly more polished with some interesting additions. I quite like the new level up system which promotes completion of content over just beating down random thugs for grind exp.   Story: Good so far, the voice acting is well done and the story is compelling.  Problems: EVERY WHERE. Honestly this game looks and plays like a trashy console port (which it is). Even with a 5ghz OC cpu and a 780gtx with 16 gigs of ram I can barely get 20fps with everything on low. The new NVIDIA drivers seemed to help somewhat, but the game has constant microstutter which makes it extremely hard to get into.   Summary: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

            "review_text": "To me, the biggest twist in all of this was, none of us expected such a horrible turd port from a company like this, and knowingly releasing it anyway.  The main reason why I was hyped up for this game was because of WB Montreal's 'Arkham Origins' not living up to rocksteady's previous two games in terms of polishing and quality. My Origins savegame is stuck in a nightclub after gaining the Disarm Combo in an obtuse game upgrade decision, and deciding to chase after a Datapack right afterwards, and since that is not a 'game progression' glitch, in that what I did was totally optional, they opted to no longer release patches to fix some of the remaining glitches left.  I figured rocksteady would produce different results with Arkham Knight though, and I guess in a mischievous magical genie way, they sure did.  I own a Geforce 750 GTi variant that has two fans with an i3 and 8GBs of ram, so as a PC user whose rig is not from the future, I can tell you that even in the lowest settings, this game will freeze constantly getting inside the Batmobile, driving the Batmobile, during cutscenes, and generally while diving or flying in the air because of the atrocious motion blur (among many other features) that cannot be turned off.   Applying the quick .ini fix to uncap the frame rate right now does fix problems for the first twenty minutes, so I can play without a hitch with some settings turned high under 1920x1080. After that, the game suffers through a memory leak, and eventually crashes.  I didn't expect them to actually suspend PC game sales so that they could fix this thing, so serious props to that. On the other hand though, there was a reason why they changed the initial release date from Oct. 2014 to June 2015, and you can see definitely see why! It works and looks great on the Xbox One and the PS4.  TLDR Version: This game tells me that I can become the batman. I cannot be Batman right now.  August 22, 2015 EDIT:  Still no patch by the way.   December 23, 2015 EDIT:  I've long since finished this on a console, I didn't get my refund awhile ago because I bought this from Green Man Gaming, At this point, I don't care anymore, they have my money now, I'm going to play something else that doesn't have an awful DLC plan, which is actually becoming rare now.

            "review_text": "I'll level with you. Batman: Arkham Knight was the game I've been waiting for for the last several years. I have a great deal of love for the previous games in the franchise. I was absolutely amazed by the story of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. As a rampant fan of the 1990's animated series and a well read reader of the comics, I saw and recognized all the little easter eggs and story elements that the Arkham games had drawn from. I am the core demographic that the game was marketed towards. So when the PC port of Arkham Knight released this morning in absolutely abysmal shape, I was more than a little upset. I spent over twelve hours trying to resolve issues ranging from broken Xbox One Controller support to stuttering performance to hard crashes within the first few seconds of the game. I never advanced into the story any more than that.  What little I could explore in the game, including the game's graphics options and PC benchmark stress test demo, told me just how poor of a port this game was. At least on the PC. The benchmark frame rate lingered in the low 20's even on the lowest graphics settings on my pretty respectable SLI gaming rig. And when I went to change those graphics settings, I found the options very much lacking. There are only a few changeable settings including little more than resolution, texture quality, and shadow density. The rest of the settings were entirely nVidia GameWorks and Physx settings.  To make matters worse, the game's benchmark showed headache-inducing levels of motion blur, film grain filters, and depth-of-field effects that are completely unchangeable in-game. To turn them off, you have to quit the game and go into the game's installation folder, and manually edit the game's .ini file.  I was in shock. Arkham City had all of these settings in the in-game menu years ago. This is 2015. I couldn't believe Rocksteady had devolved so much in their historically stellar PC support.  Then I saw a developer post on the game's official forums admitting that the PC port of the game was handled 'by an external PC development partner'. Turns out Rocksteady didn't handle the PC port of the game at all.  Now... I consider myself an avid gamer. I'm well aware that day one PC releases are just expected to be broken until a few patches iron out things. But... This goes even further. The game performs so poorly on my high-end gaming rig that I am SERIOUSLY considering returning the game and boycotting it out of principle. I never do that, and it guts me to even consider doing that to my most anticipated game of the year... But the way WB handled this... It's just so... disgusting.  In truth, the more research I do in my quest to find out what happened with the development process of Arkham Knight, it became more and more obvious that Warner Bros. Studios had a heavy hand involved with the development cycle of the game. I'm not sure the blame can actually be placed on the Rocksteady developers for this one. It looks more and more like the majority of the issues with the game are from the involvement of external sources.    Verdict: Do not buy this game until the issues are fixed.",

But after the fixes, I fully enjoyed this game. Having no experience with any of the Batman Arkham games, I found this game to be fairly easy to pick up in gameplay but not in the story, since the previous games link quite heavily with this one.   Content wise this game has a lot to offer, there is a lot to do not only the main quest but there are also side quests, and I must say that both are very detailed, challenging and fun. The side quests also introduced new villians along with the usual villians that have never been featured in previous games; they are less well known, for example Professor Pyg (spoilers). I never ran out of things to do and still continuing to complete the game.   Now 15 months after launch I still reccomend this game to people that ask me whether this game is good. At this stage this game has also reduced in price (especially on sites like CDkeys) so it's worth it.  The best part of this purchase was that I got all the previous games and DLCs for free due to the PC port issue and I intend to play through them aswell. (Yeah I'm a bragging piece of trash. LOL) ",

            "review_text": "The best Arkham game in my opinion. Addition of the batmobile for fast movement and fun racing combat adds a lot of variety to what would have otherwise been a lot of running and gliding around rooftops. Besides that, there are lots of twists and turns in the story and some great moments which I wouldn't want to spoil. Combat is great, however, I felt like they have reached a point where it is becoming very complicated. You now have a special combo move for every gadget and enemies now charge and perform fast moves - it's a lot to remember.  Due to the patches post-launch, performance has been good for me, I have a GTX 970 and 16GB of RAM and was able to run at high settings at a stable 60fps. Best looking game I have played by far, loads fast as well and environments are very destructable with the batmobile.  I recommend having the season pass on your first playthrough if at all, some of it is very piecemeal DLC, so you wouldn't want to go back for it later. It all adds up into quite a lot of content and gives you a lot more side quests to do if you don't want to barrel through the main quest. The 2 1960s batman race tracks from the season pass are amazing as well, possibly my favourite part of the entire game.  Waiting for a sale on the premium edition is my overall recommendation. The recent sale for this game was 66% off, that's insane. Don't be that guy that buys the game full price and then it drops the day after.",

I can't help but say that I was disappointed.  The story is interesting until it's a nightmare. I seriously loved batmobile at first, it was something new and exciting - something everyone's always pretty much wanted into these games. But when you have to use batmobile 90% of the time for the boss fights, it gets boring and annoying very fast.  I also waited to see more villains but everyone's roles were very small, unless they're the Arkham Knight. Even Scarecrow, who was supposed to be the 'big bad guy', doesn't have many scenes in the end. I really loved him in Arkham Asylum so I waited more, and this game was a let-down there as well.  If I have to say something that was positive, it was the ending scene with Scarecrow. It was something new and thrilling, especially after all the super boring boss fights. I also liked the different point of views.  But yeah, this game wasn't what I expected and it definitely doesn't get the 'best game in the Arkham -series' title from me.",

            "review_text": "TL:DR is the game is good enough to warrant a purcahse if you think you can run it and if you enjoyed the previous entries.  So let's get the obvious out of the way - this game had an utterly unforgivable launch. I will not buy from Rocksteady again. The only reason I had to purchase this game was the investment I had in the universe itself.   NEGATIVES: - Tank warfare... Like really? Weak. - Major boss fights end up being car fights, utterly ridiculous. - Performance issues, regularly skips frames - They ruined freeflow and combat in general. By adding ridiculous amounts of enemies who you can't just up and attack, they make maintaining flow almost impossible. On top of this, the prioritizing for which enemies you attack (i.e. the game assumes I intend to instant takedown a brute instead of an unarmed goon) is also botched. I will try to disarm and destroy a shield and end up attacking someone with a baseball bat. Just in general, the combat has taken a huge step down in playability, enjoyability, and flow. - FEAR takedowns are way too important. I get it, Batman has a new gimmick. Don't make it a necessity for stealth. - Instead of locking a Riddler cutscene to his quest line, the actual story's conclusion in its entirety is locked until you 100% all the default missions. Including 240 riddler trophies... - DLC is very short, but because I bought this so long after release, I felt the lower price was fair.  POSITIVES: + Still an Arkham game. The story, as botched as the intro is, ends up being fairly fun. It's no where near as good as City or Asylum, however. + Batcomputer data is fun to read, even though it isn't as extensive as City's batcomputer data. + The batmobile is actually pretty fun. It's just not the right game or universe for the kind of combat they shoehorned in. + Voice acting is, for the most part, on par with the other games. It's not phenomenal, but it doesn't distract. + The batmobile riddles are mostly pretty good. Some are cheap as hell though. I spent twenty minutes working on a riddle only to discover I needed an upgrade that is unmarked and unmentioned by anything, and you only get it by doing certain riddles - but that's not enough for me to consider them all bad. + You can play, provided you have the DLC, as a lot of characters in AR mode (new challenge mode) + Dual team combat is a blast. I wish they had focused more on this than FEAR and batmobile combat. They could have made the game co-op with a little more work. + Graphics are superb when the game isn't dropping frames + Satisfying ending mission, use youtube for final cutscene (which is less satisfying to the point of being frustrating)  All in all... Lots of mixed elements here. Overall I think I got my money's worth, but I'm really invested in the franchise. For someone who just wants to play an Arkham game, I suggest City.",

So, my rig: CPU: i7-2600k@4GHz; GPU: MSI GTX970 Armor; RAM: 12Gigs DDR3@2133MHz HDD: 9 years old (!)Western Digital HDD with 7200 RPM; OS: Windows 7 pro 64-bit.   I started to play game version downloaded on 9th of November. Please note that i closed all background programs except Steam and BAK. (You want to play this game smooth? Pls close Pronhub and Youtube and torrents, guys c'mon!) I ran this game on Nvidia driver v.355.82 (not last) and havent messed with .ini file or third-party tweak programs for BAK. Game settings i've used: Resolution:1980x1080 V-sync: OFF Max FPS: 90 Texture Resolution: High Shadow Quality: High Level of Detail: High Film Grain: OFF Texture Filtering: Anisotropic 16x Anti-aliasing: off (without it i have 78-110 fps all the time, so just experiment with it) Motion Blur: OFF (who need dat s h i t anyway?) Chromatic Abberation: ON Interactive Smoke: OFF Paper Debris: OFF (these two are causing the most stuttering) Enhanced rain: ON Enhacned Light Shafts: ON.   I've noticed that stuttering in this game was caued by Smoke and paper debris! Turn them off and you good to go! Also note that for some weird reason forcing Anisotropic Filtering from Nvidia Control Panel also caused some stuttering (for me anyway) so try experimenting with it or set it to 'Application Controlled' as i do for this game. Also set Power Consumption in NVCP to 'Max Perfomance' isntead of 'Adaptive'. It also helps.   So with PC and game and system settings mentioned above i got no CTD, almost no stuttering at all (once or twice after 3 hours of gameplay and it quickly vanished) and trully great game experience. I hope this helps.   Batman Arkham fans will LOVE this game.  10/10 Will ask about DETONATOR again!",

Despite that it only crashed twice, which I attribute to upgrading to Windows 10 since the game was fine after I reinstalled it, and I never got forever stuck in a Riddler room like in the sad excuse of a game, Batman Arkham Origins. And thank Joker that this is not Arkham Origins.  Was it worthy of a 'last hurrah' of the Batman series? The launch said no. Still I only had major lag related with smoke effects, and that's fixed by turning them off in the Gameworks settings. I had the rest of Nvidia Gamework's options on, and recorded a lot of the game with Fraps, and still had no lag for 90% of the game.  Now onto the actual game. $40 DLC is a ridiculous price for the content they so far haven't released. The graphics are stunning, the cutscenes are smooth and the animations are great. The gameplay and combat is just as good as previous Batman games, although I always missed counters in this one, and the puzzles are even better than before. The side missions are disturbing and the main story is long and completely comic-book worthy. The enemies sound great, the events feel like Batman, and the game is in general just awesome. I had a lot of fun, and although it's not everything it should have been from the beginning, it's much better than Origins and still gets a recommend from me. Of the seires it's become my favorite, with City being second, Asylum being third, and Origins being so dead last I wouldn't put it on the list. In fact let's pretend Origins doesn't exist.  I would probably wait until they fix all the issues on PC before buying, if they ever do, or get it on a console if you have one.",

RS wrote a great story line with excellent scripts for the entire cast. The story is is the best out of all the games in the series and while you definitely expect certain events to happen before they actually do happen the orchestration of the events make you enjoy every second of the story.  Something about Origins' fighting gameplay always felt off to me. Like the beat of a song being screwed up. RS has implemented their trusted combat controls and controlling Batman is as fluid as it was before. Major Batman villains are worked into the story in a non-forced manner and create a fun filler experience during the main story or after you complete the main story to activate the ending. If there's one bad thing there it's that you NEED to do those side-quests to activate one ending. And then you need to 100% the game (including Riddler Trophies) for the true ending. Seriously?

I felt like Rocksteady spread my cheeks and forced those effing trophies into my happy, carefree world when they stripped me of my trophy virginity. I fear I cannot play any of the other Arkham games ever again without shedding a tear if I see another green '?'. So spare yourself the misery and just look up the true ending on YouTube instead.  The Batmobile is a forced addition into the game and it's a little overdone, but not to the point of boredom. I also feel that the Batmobile sequences are done very well and tight controls make it extremely rewarding when you're up against seemingly impossible odds. It's BATMAN after all! There were one or two times when I was extremely frustrated by a seemingly impossible task, but once I did complete the mission it was one of the most rewarding events in my gaming history. Kinda like when you beat Ganondorf for the first time but without the confusion that followed.  Graphics look great even on Medium settings. It certainly looks as good or better than Origins. I have 2 780 Ti's (not that it matters because this game doesn't support SLI) and I can play on 5900x1080 on medium settings. That's not as good as I'd hoped but still much better than how it was at launch, apparently. If you have SLI cards change the game to be in windowed mode without borders. Somehow it just runs better that way than in fullscreen mode even though it looks exactly the same.  52 hours in, 100% completion, am I going to play NG+? You bet I am. I can't wait to go through the story again. It's that good. Thank goodness the Riddler trophies carry over *shudder*.",

I'm gonna cut the suspense; Don't buy this game in its current state, because the optimisation, or lack of optimisation and its performance issues are unacceptable. It's one of the worst ports ever seen, and most importantly, this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t must stop.   Did I enjoy Arkham Knight? Absolutely. It's more of the same thing, in a polished version.The designs are very good, with some debatable choices for some characters, notably the Batsuit, or Penguin, but I personally found every choice really enjoyable. Gotham feels like it always should have felt; Dark, sexy, ancient and mysterious.   The gameplay is a bliss; I really liked the inclusion of the Batmobile. I loved the driving sensations, I liked the tank battles, I liked the puzzles using it, and I liked how it helped the navigation into Gotham to feel smoother, with enhanced gliding sensations as well.   Batman feels more powerful and has more possibilities than ever, with really fun combat and a predator system which feels great and refreshing with more agressive enemies, more restrictive gadgets.Not that you will feel real difficulty while playing the game, especially if you already played the previous installments in the series.  The story is more enjoyable than the Arkham City ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but it lacks depth, is filled with plot holes, and while it has its fan service moments, with notably one character which presence made me smile a lot, what saves it from being sucked into oblivion is its very good presentation and directing.  There are of course some sidequests appart from the main story. While some of them, focusing on interesting villains, are really enjoyable, some others felt redundant and useless. And there comes my second point preventing me to recommend this game; THIS GAME IS NOT FINISHED.  There's not really any challenge maps, with only eight to ten dedicated to combat AND stealth. While you can play other really fun characters during the story, with a neat dual play system, you can't select these characters for the challenge maps. There's barely any content in the main free roam mode, with four to five interesting sidequests, the rest being boring generic and repetitive missions, mostly the mandatory Riddler challenges, which are smore frustrating and tedious than ever&nbsp;;  The strategy of Warner Bros and Rocksteady are to give content for the next six months, content like new characters to play and new sidequests, which you would gain by paying 40 euros for the season pass.  And this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.   Selling a poorly optimized and unfinished game to fans is not something I can accept, and for that I can't recommend Arkham Knight. Which is a shame because it is a fun game, but for now, it is an alpha, and I would say that even if there wasn't any technical issues. I loved it, but wait a year for its GOTY, or buy it at a low price on other sites. In any case, wait for a patch.   Oh, and ♥♥♥♥ YOU Warner Bros games for being an evil and greedy corporation with no respect for its customers, and ♥♥♥♥ YOU Rocksteady for not being able to not sell your soul.",

Turn down some of the more intense settings like physx or enhanced light shafts, and you should be good to go.   Let me start by saying I work with computers and i built my own computer (core i7-4790k and gtx970, 16gb ram).  I know lots of people are having trouble running this game. When i first started it up, i checked online for optimal settings (i believe the game runs Unreal engine so it should be tweakable). I ended up using a tweaker, Batman Tweak Tool (google it, its on steam forums) to make sure the most intensive options were disabled for smooth gameplay. I did notice a tiny slowdown in tank fights later in my game, i also did happen to update my video drivers and windows 10 (1511 update) the day before, so that might have changed something.  Running the game aside, i love this game. LOVE IT. After 20+ hours of playing through and beating the main story (working on completionist stuff at this point), i would have to say this is the BEST arkham game ever. In fact this is one of the best games i have ever played, period. The side stories are all fleshed out, the main story is really good, the game has a solid atmosphere (although every once in a while the radio chatter can get annoying, like if you go near any car, there is a criminial going 'oh no its batman, floor it!'). For about half the game, i had my dad watching me play. He doesnt really like video games but even he was into the story and puzzles. Overall, the game is pretty much everything you could want from an Arkham game. Well, i think ive said enough, time for me to go solve some Riddles :P ",

For me, the game was definitely playable, though I did have substantial framerate stuttering here and there whenever the batmobile was involved with something. My GTX 960 does pretty for the most part.  Aside from all the controversy regarding its release and the performance for many people, I think this very well may just be the most polished game in the Arkham series. The story is back up there in quality with Arkham Asylum, which is commonly lauded for its tightly-woven story. The combat and stealth are, I believe, the superior iterations compared to other games in the series. Fear multitakedowns are really satisfying. Gotham feels like a believable world, for the most part. The atmosphere of the overall game is really well-done.  Then there's the whole batmobile thing.  I liked the batmobile. Once you get used to how it handles, it's real fun to use. I think they did a good job bringing the batmobile into the game technically speaking (and ignoring things like framerate drops). My main issue with the batmobile was how prevalent it was in the core gameplay of the game. It felt like every 5 seconds the developers were trying to shove the damn thing down your throat because they were so proud of what they made, which got kind of obnoxious. Things that didn't need a batmobile section got a batmobile section. The vehicle combat was fun, but got really exhausting towards the end of the campaign. The whole thing was definitely a little overplayed.  Also, everything being destructible, while INCREDIBLY entertaining and super cool, seemed a little out of character for Batman. I thought it was a little odd.  That said, I'd recommend the game to those who are willing to risk seeing whether or not it works on your system. If you're a fan of the Arkham series then this game is definitely a must-play. It's a shame the release of this game went the way it did because it really is a great game.",

Let's start with   Performance  , the one concern most people, even myself were/are curious about. It doesn't perform consistently well, you'll get plenty of good averaging FPS but there are times it drops at the least demanding scenarios. It's certainly playable but it will never be truly fixed or great.   6/10 Performance  .  Gameplay: It remains relatively similar to previous titles, there are a few additions to provide variations to the usual gameplay style.   Story: Great, except the Boss Battles.     Predator scenarios include a range of different mechanics now, be it to yourself like Fear Takedowns or enemies who have devices to detect your location if you use Detective Mode. It provides a increased challenge to the game, something which I personally enjoy, the predator scenarios dont always play out the same.      Combat has seen the addition of tag teams with Robin/NightWing/Catwoman, remains all good.     Then there is the Batmobile.  The emphasis on the Batmobile, it clouds a large portion of the game, the story/game is over 60-70% Batmobile? I enjoy racing about the Gotham but every other mission was blow these tanks up, avoid these Cobra tanks (♥♥♥♥ THOSE). I didn't mind using the Batmobile to get out of particular sitatuions etc but man it was just TOO MUCH imo.   I can't recommend a game which is still buried with bugs, performance issues, or call it 'BatMobile Arkham Tank' if you will.    tl;dr - If you can deal with the various Bugs, over use of Batmobile, inconsistent performance, Get it on Sale. £10 or less.",

The Batmobile felt out of place. I play these games to soar from rooftops and punch criminals in their faces, not to drive. The tank segments were sometimes fun, but not fun enough to justify forcing us to drive.  Other than that, a lot of what makes these games fun is intact and better here. The graphics, story, voice acting, combat, gadgets, and overall sense of being Batman are in full effect. The combat is especially tight and responsive, which is nice after the less than perfect Arkham Origins. The way the story cleverly explores the mind of Batman is brilliant.

This time Batman's humanity is exposed to everyone. We've never seen the mighty night cry, doubt or blame himself. We've never seen him weak or suffering, let alone feeling sorry for him. One night will turn his world upside down and make us, the players, worry about the unstoppable, as we thought before, icon of the world culture.

After all there is no better way to know what it feels like to be a superhero...because the dark knight, a human, is the closest one to you or me. Not a mutant, not a god or a bitten by genetically raised spider student from Marvel's universe. 'Be the Batman'. Anyone can be the batman.That's the whole idea of the dark knight.

Frames are 24-29, never a steady 30. WTF WB? WTF Rocksteady? WTF Iron Galaxy, or whoever the hell you are? I've seen actual, literal crap run better than this (Hint: Diahrrea chah chah chah).   DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY!  WB then apologizes, by handing us free copies of old games which most batman fans already own, and currently cost peanuts. Yeah no thanks. They released DLC on re-release day with a patch that didn't fix anything - prioritizing selling more of a broken game over fixing it. It turns out the DLC is incredibly short and overpriced. Then in more shady manuevering, the re-release classified all prior reviews as 'pre-release' so they wouldn't count for a negative score on steam (Joke's on you, I waited!), and finally they tried to hide it again with a 'bundle' that actually doesn't give you anything extra, but hides the review score on the bundle purchase page. After all that, they're still trying to pull tricks on average consumers.  DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY!  Apparently this game runs well on consoles. If you have any conviction that business practices such as these suck, then show some consumer backlash and DON'T BUY THIS ON ANY PLATFORM EVER.  DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY!",

'  Unfortunately I can't seem to get into the enjoyment of the game. the sound stutters and cuts out completely at times. The camera controls are bad and even at low grafic I get stutters.   The controls for the PC if you don't have a gamepad are stupid, and makes it (for me atleast) impossible to use all the bats moves, gadgets etc fluently...   Frankly I got bored and frustrated fast due to this. Getting stuck in missions with no hints as to what to do, or just button mashing because the controls suck.

            "review_text": "Before I begin my review let me clarify a couple things first. When this game originally released I did not own my PC so I did not experience first hand the bugs that occured for many users when the game was first released. I will admit that even though I love the Arkham series (and mostly anything with Batman), I was hesitant to buy the game. However, once I built my new PC I was looking for games, and this one piqued my interest.  To get to the point; I LOVE THIS GAME! I have yet to expeience any crashes/bugs/glitches which is always a plus coming from a game that was initially littered with them. I can play on maximum graphical settings at 60fps, and I only get noticeable framedrops when there is alot going on the screen (racing the Batmobile in Gotham).   PROS:  - Great Story: It is really hard for me to decide which of the Arkham games have the best story, but good golly Batman, this one was suspensful! - Great Aesthetics: The graphics on ultra settings are amazing, and great environmental design. - Character Models: Definitely the best of the Arkham series by far, especially Catwoman's which is waaay better than Arkham City. And, the alternate costumes actually appear in the cutscenes. Finally! - Familiar gameplay with added mechanics: I was able to jump right in and pick up where I left off from the other games, which is nice, and the takedowns are just as satisfying as ever. - Voice Acting: Great voice acting.   CONS: - No Open-World for Other Characters: There is a mod for this (which I use), however it would be nice to have this in the game without needing a mod. - Very Little Replayability: Not that the other Arkham games had this once you tackle all the other challenges, but this game does lack the Predator and Combo maps that I used to love/hate in the previous iterations. I just bought the season pass, so maybe that will keep it going, but I ahte having to spend more money on games just to make them better. - Not enough dual combat encounters: I may be being a little picky here, but I think Rocksteady missed a great opportunity to allow Batman and Robin to fight crime in the city side by side! Playing as both characters in the open world would be so sick, but alas you must buy the DLC which comes with a few 'challenge maps'.  No Category: - The Ending: While a think that the ending was a good ending that fit the story, it really left me wanting more, and wanting to see how they other characters continued to live on. - DLC: Immediately I bought the 1989 pack. Those models for the costume and the Batmobile are incredible. If I were to reccomend the packs to purchase however, I would say only buy the Season of Infamy, the Matter of Family, and the Red Hood/Harley Quinn packs. Honestly, the other character 'episodes' were lacking. As far as costume go, they are all fantastic and I would highly reccomend them, but I'm sure that people would prefer to pick and choose. (But for the love of god, bring back the BTAS one! D:)  Final verdict: For me it was worth the $50 I spent. The season pass maybe not so much, but if you are debating whether to get this, just wait for a Steam sale and pick it up, because this game is great. I have a single GPU, and I have heard that those running SLI are the users experiencing performance issues. I cannot confirm this since I am not running SLI, please consult with a review that is running SLI before you buy if necessary. Also, there is a banchmark video for this game on Youtube which is running on a machine with my specs so I also highly reccomend watching that.  My PC Specs (for others convenience): - AMD FX-8320 (Clocked at 3.5GHz, no OC yet) - Cooler Master Hyper EVO 212 CPU fan (never seen it reach more than 50*C) - EVGA GTX 960 [4GB VRAM] - 16GB DDR3 1600 RAM - Samsung EVO 850 250GB SSD - 1TB Western Digital Blue HDD (Installed game on this one accidently) - ASUS Sabertooth 990FX R2.0 MOBO - Other items that are not relevant to this game experince :P",

I already own the PS4 version and got the PC one due to the sale and customer reviews on the product page claiming that things are fixed. I also want to play the game in 60 FPS. It's locked to 30 on PS4. I got that, but other performance issues are still there. Either these people lucked out or have a really powerful rig.

And no matter what settings I turn off/on, it performs the exact same. But the good thing is I only get crashes about as much as the previous Arkham games.  Also, in the developer's defense, GTAV had almost lifelike graphics and effects as well, and it took like 2 years extra for a pc port?   Anyways, the storyline so far is pretty good. I've only played it for a few hours. It needs less Robin, more Catwoman though.  Update: It seems (for me) the fps loss isn't related to what you're doing or how many npcs there are, but where you are in Gotham. So when driving the batmobile or in combat, you may experience sudden fps loss, which makes it feel a little more frantic.",

So I waited till it was put back on and waited even some more in case there were other issues. I purchased this game in April 2016 and my experience has been pretty smooth so far. I experienced one crash so far but with the 6 hours of gameplay, that was about it. No other hiccups. No BSOD's. No other errors. My fingers are still crossed but so far so good.  As for the game itself. It remains true to the previous Batman titles. The fighting is still very fluid and controls perform well. Using the Batmobile is a nice touch to the series but feels a little 'arcady' at times. The story is also done very well. Of course your main goals are to stop Scarecrow and the new Arkham Knight, but the side missions they included make it enough to not make it feel too linear.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful. The level of detail on the characters are amazing. And the city has a very dark, gritty feel to it.   Im not a huge Batman fan but the Arkham games do manage to draw my attention and keep it. Numerous times in the game you really do feel like the Dark Knight. Whether it is being a detective and solving puzzles or being stealthy and taking out enemies.   So despite the abysmal launch. I can attest that most of the issues have been ironed out (at least in my experience). SO I say give it a try. Perhaps get it when on sale so you don’t feel too bad if you have a bad experience with it. Overall I recommend picking up this game.  ",

On one hand, it still looks as good as ever and the gameplay is still enjoyable, while on the other, it ran terribly and (to me) had a bit of a disappointing ending. The gameplay is as smooth as ever, and combat feels great. The inclusion of the Batmobile is also pretty fun, although it handles somewhat poorly for it to be a main mechanic (races/chases were a bit of a struggle), but that can also be attributed to mouse and keyboard controls. My main problem is just how unoptimized and badly ported this game was from console to PC. Constant frame drops, glitchy models and mechanics, and frustratingly repetitive missions. The story had some interesting moments, but the ending just left me frustrated. That's really the word I'd use to describe this game: frustrating. If you're a die-hard fan of the Batman franchise, then pick this up in a sale. Otherwise, I'd leave it alone.",

Yes, the Batmobile is awkward to control (at first) and overused in story missions.  Yes, the challenge maps from prior Rocksteady Batman games have been removed (DLC cash grab?) in favor of AR Challenges, which force you to play as Batman alone for the most part.  Despite all those flaws, Rocksteady did it again--Arkham Knight offers engaging and varied gameplay deftly interwoven with a compelling and richly detailed story that is just the right length.

Love the duo combat system for some scenarios.   Cons: 1.) The game really wasn’t ready for PC release.   a. The game has some serious compatibility issues. In its current state, this title reads as “Game Cannot be optimized.” with Nvidia Experience. Which is not allowing me to enable Interactive Smoke or debris, among other graphical settings.   2.) The game does suffer from some infrequent (from my own personal experience using the rig outlined below at the end of the review) lag and frame rate drops.   3.) More infrequent than the lag mentioned just before, I do experience some crazy world pixelizations. Where the game environment is reduced to some super high rez version of mine craft. I’ll attempt to capture a game recording the next time it happens.   4.) To much focus on the bat mobile during gameplay. They should have treated it as a tool in Batmans belt.

It's incredibly easy to figure out who he is from his first line of dialogue if you know your Batman. Riddler driving challenges upset my ex who absolutely loves Riddler so that's a plus. Kidding aside that's a weird choice to me. Also Riddler looks like someone's dad and not like Riddler at all. He also doesn't really act like Riddler. Was also disappointed by how little we see the other villains in the main story.    The ♥♥♥♥ing batmobile though! IT'S IN EVERY DAMN MISSION! NOT EXAGGERATING MUCH! I really hated the batmobile by the end of this game. I think the freeflow combat, forgiving a few little hiccups, is improved and while the new 'more aggressive' multitakedowns do sort of make the prowler missions feel a lot less stealthy they are entertaining to watch.

I have absolutely loved the Arkham series as a whole, but even still, Arkham Knight was ultimately a bit of a disappointment for me. I won't go into the whole bit about the dismal PC port - that's been talked about to death. I think it was simply a title where Rocksteady really strove for something - a certain game direction/goal - and yet didn't quite make it. Despite some absolutely brilliant pros, the cons simply couldn't be overcome, so let's do those first:   CONS:    1. Rocksteady really doubled down on the Batmobile. Granted a lot of folks asked for the car but the problem is, I just didn't find it *fun* to drive. In fact, it was very hard to control and I think my Batman not only killed 500 people, but ended up destroying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property as I couldn't stay on the damn road half the time ! Add in the bit where you had to use it for the absolutely horrid Riddler missions and upgrade it to take down certain villains and you end up with a car that turned into an essential character. I HATED that I felt it necessary to use my first few dozen upgrade points on the damn car in the hope that it might be less painful to drive. It was a cool design, but was much too integrated into gameplay.   2. Riddler. I've unlocked 100% of the Riddler trophies among all 4 games and I never EVER enjoyed them. I have obsessive compulsive disorder though and feel the NEED to do them. Roleplaying as Batman also means I can't cheat or let Eddie go free so I have to do them ALL. This game at least gave us much fewer trophies to hunt than before which was good, along with a few varieties (bomb guys, car races...grrrr), but I swear Eddie was more obnoxious than ever. I mean, how could you not do 100% just to shut him up and enjoy the satisfaction of punching him in his stupid face? The normal Most Wanted questline to save Catwoman was more than enough thanks, especially considering those *AWFUL, AWFUL* race tracks !   3. Story. I found the story very weak. It was easy to guess who the AK was and I was disappointed that the Scarecrow was not actually in the game very much. But overall, there were some truly obnoxious areas to play through like the Batmobile vs the Excavator area, the Batmobile vs the AK super tank and the Batmobile vs Deathstroke in HIS Supertank. The airships and underground areas were not very fun to play through either. I felt like the genreral story tempo was just 'off' - after you face AK and learn who he is, it felt like that was coming to the end - yet then there was suddenly MORE tank fights ahead (I can't tell you how discouraged I was to finally clear all the tanks, bombs and checkpoints - only to have them all reset after DS takes over). Soooo much recycled content.   4. Robin, Nightwing, Azrael and Catwoman - the gang was all herre, looking great and ready to help Batman at a time of greatest need, yet they were all woefully underused. And no, saying Bats wanted to protect them is just a cop out from not integrating them more into the story. I mean, Nightwing is insanely popular - GET HIM IN THERE ! Rocksteady seemingly did the impossible and made Robin kick-♥♥♥ and cool yet they then decided to stick him in a cell and use him as Bat-bait! The supporting cast deserved better.   5. Performances. Whoever voiced Gordon, Deathstroke and Two-face were terrible and I hate to say it, but Kevin Conroy's performance was wooden at best. No, I don't buy the whole 'Batman was sick' thing - he was monotone through the whole game and frequently pronounced words weirdly 'I have to get to Bris-Tol immediately !'.   6. No free roam. Seriously - fans have been asking for this for how long now? I know there are mods out there, but RS would win a lot of brownie points back from fans if they would simply let us roam around the beautiful city they created with the hero of our choice (and don't tell me it's not possible RS - there are mods out there that can do it easily enough - just give us something official please !  Pros:  1. It wasn't all bad. Rocksteady deserves to take a bow on their interpretation of Gotham City. I frankly loved Arkham Origins version as it was *really* dark and gothic with lots of room to roam around, but I have to give the edge to RS's version as the scope of it is brilliant and was the highlight of the game for me. It's true - part of the Batman mythos for me is swooping around the large cityscape canyons between skyscrapers and gothic buildings. The structures here are higher, the addition to the newer, modern buildings on Founders Isle are great, the industrial areas and the entire lower level areas mixed well with Chinatown and more traditional gothic structures. It was a joy to nosedive off the top of Wayne Tower and glide through the city while swooping onto cars, etc. The water and rain effects were wonderful too !   2. Performances - Mark Hamill and John Noble were both *outstanding*. My only regret with John was that I wish we had more of him. I understand that this was his first voice acting gig; I hope it is not his last. Mark really outdid himself though as Joker was a major, major highlight throughout the game. The song and dance number was the most entertaining part of the whole game for me ; ) Oracle, Robin, Nightwing, AK, Riddler, Penguin were all top-notch as well.   3. Combat and predator moves - just when I think they couldn't refine their combat system anymore, they go and prove me wrong. Additions such as medics and heavy weapons guys add to the challenge, as do gadgets such as the wonderful voice modulator. Dual-mode fighting was a lot of fun too. A shame the grapple gadget Batman stole from Deathstroke in Origins didn't make it into this game, that was the one thing I was missing.   4. Challenge modes are fun and varied.  In closing, this game was - for me at least - an admirable misfire. I applaud Rocksteady for having the ambition to put a lot of effort into building a massive city to explore and attempting to infuse a new style of gameplay into what is, granted, a very established franchise that is getting long in the tooth. But at this point in the franchise, there is no exscuse for a weak story and AK suffers from that. The new Batmobile gameplay was a major addition, yet it was not very entertaining (it was actually outright tedious and obnoxious at times - lookin' at you Riddler and Drone army). The PC technical issues undermined the whole experience with frequent crashes and weird graphical glitches. Sadly, I feel that will be the real legacy of this title, at least on PC; certainly not the story or gameplay and that's a real shame. All in all, not the worst game I ever played; if you decide to get it, I recommend making sure you're buying it on sale.",

If you uncap it to 60fps, expect a lot of stuttering and framerate that goes all over the place. If you want the game to be solid, Keep it locked at 30 and you shouldn't have any problem. Or get the console version. So yeah, PC port is ♥♥♥♥, but the game itself is extremely well made.  UPDATE: So now that all the DLCs has released, I can say that the Season Pass is good. Not worth $40, but good. It has some good content like the Season of Infamy and Arkham Episodes, but it has some ♥♥♥♥ content like challenges that were clearly ripped out of the main game just so that WB could make a bit more money.  So in my opinion, the game is amazing. You can get it off CD Keys sites for about $20 for both the game and the Season Pass.",

Cons: -Arkham Knight's identity is blatantly obvious if have any familiarity with Batman lore. -Scarecrow - who was advertised as the main villain - plays THIRD string to two other villains. Worse, he's barely in it, your encounters are minimal. Massive disappointment. -The final mission or 'boss' fight is a joke. It's hollow, completely story-driven, with no challenge. -Tank mode gets tedious very quickly. Its mechanics are nowhere near as deep as brawling or predator mode. -Do you like blowing up lots of drones and fighting endless hordes of soldiers? Like, 60-70% of the time? Then this is the game for you!  Let me start off with this: my thumbs up is despite the massive controversy on Arkham Knight's PC release. I made the mistake of pre-ordering it, even getting a big gaming PC after years of laptops. This was the game that made me decide whether to go PS4 or PC. And honestly, there weren't (and still aren't) enough console excluvies on the PS4 that interested me enough to warrant getting it. Not when I can use my Steam backlog and get games ridiculously cheap.  But honestly, despite those problems, I find myself agreeing with many reviewers who gave it scores like 6 or 7/10. It's a massive disappointment after the hype. I regret pre-ordering it and paying full price for it. I would've said that even if I bought it on PS4.  THE STORY &amp; CHARACTERS  The story feels paper thin compared to previous games. There are few twists or turns in the game and fewer villain encounters in the main part of the story. Most villains are disappointingly stuffed into side missions. Worse, game's big mystery - the Arkham Knight's identity - is so blatantly obvious from the first line he utters, that by the time he's finally revealed, the game is nearly over and it's pretty much meaningless. There's a third villain along with Scarecrow and Arkham Knight who plays a major role in the game. Without spoiling it, they appear most often through the game, stealing the spotlight from the two villains who SHOULD have been the focus. Scarecrow especially gets the short stick, relegated mostly to taunting you on the city's big screens, overusing the word 'fear' in his speeches. The final mission isn't even a mission or a boss fight. It's an unchallenging, story-driven walking simulator for the most part.  Where Rocksteady excels, though, is the characters and voice work. Kevin Conroy always knocks it out of the park as Batman and everyone else shines as usual. Although, while I enjoyed John Noble's Scarecrow in this game, he's kind of ho-hum for what I expected. Almost all his lines are fear this or scare that. It gets old very fast. One surprise return - and the voice actor - is a constant pleasure.  BOSS BATTLES  This game's boss battles are by far the most disappointing. Compared to Asylum, City, and even Origins, there are absolutely no good boss battles. All those villains in the side-missions? Most of them, you encounter three or four times, doing the exact same thing every time before they get away. Few of them even get a good, satisfying final battle. The final encounter with The Riddler is kind of fun, but it drags on and isn't very challenging. In terms of boss battles alone, Arkham Knight stands in a very low last place compared to to the others.  THE GAMEPLAY  You'll spend the vast majority of the game fighting bland soldiers and especially battling tank drones. The game's biggest criticism was 'too much Batmobile' and they're right. The Batmobile is shoe-horned into nearly every aspect of the game. Riddler, for example, forces you to drive on race tracks, which goes ridiculously against his character and his previous challenges. Many puzzles require the Batmobile's tank mode to solve.  The tank battles? They're fun at first. At first. But the reason that brawling and predator mode were so much fun in prevoius games (and to be fair, in this game) is their depth. You have so many options to dispatch enemies that no encounter is ever the same. Not so with the tank battles. They become so formulaic and tedious - especially fighting the bigger drones you need to sneak behind to destroy - that you'll be sick of them by the third encounter.  Where the game is great is, as always, the brawling and predator modes. Like previous entries, there have been massive improvements to both modes, making it a constant treat to take down thugs and soldiers. Many new gadgets introduced in this game are fun, like the voice sythesizer. There's a new predator feature where you can take out half a dozen thugs in one fell swoop, which never got boring for me.  I also like some of other new features added to the game, like teaming up with other members of the Bat-Family. It adds a new dimension to the brawling and honestly, it wasn't used enough. I also think it could've been expanded on a little so every fight wasn't just 'build up special meter, do dual takedown, repeat.' I also think those dual takedowns should've given you the option to take out more than one thug at once.  The problem, though, is the overuse of the tank battles. They take such huge center stage that the brawling and predator modes get left to the wayside. It feels like the developers shoe-horned the tank elements into the game as much as possible. Which, as I said, gets old fast.  THE CITY  If there's one place the game excels - much like Arkham City - it's the city itself. Gotham never looked better and it's an absolute blast to traverse it. Gliding and grappling has improved since City. Now, when you launch yourself from a grapple shot, you can fly arond the city at speeds that even Superman might struggle to keep up. It's incredibly satisfying to zip and glide around the city. And while the Bat-Tank stuff gets old, I never got tired of rumbling around in the Batmobile. Some have complained about its lack of control, but I didn't have a problem with it.  One thing that I enjoyed greatly about the game was Rocksteady's use of the police station. You need to revisit it often for story purposes, side stuff, collecting, but it's fun to come back and see the cells slowly fill up with bad guys you've captured. It's especially satisfying seeing the super criminals slowly fill up one section of the station.   SIDE MISSIONS  As I said, most of the villains featured in the game are disappointing. They're fun to encounter at first, but every counter is exactly the same. Then there's hunting down the Arkham Knight's forces. Ugh. Trust me, you will get tired of the endless amount of side stuff to do there. They're all just so tedious and repetative. It's a major disappointment.  OVERALL  I know it sounds like I'm heavily criticizing the game. This was a major disappointment for me. This was supposed to be Rocksteady's big homerun. Instead, it ends as a low point on the game.

I was able to get the game to work at launch, but decided to edit the config file for 60 FPS. I notice improvement but after a recent update I started to notice dropped frames on turns or when I was gliding in to initiate fights.   I did not play the Harley Quinn DLC and unsure if I will get the Batgirl DLC. For the price they are asking it's a little high.   I give the Batman: Arkham Knight a 4.5 out of 5.  ",

It works smoothly and beautifully, the story is immensely captivating, with the use of Mark Hamill even though the Joker is dead or how they integrate over 30 years of comic books and Jason Todd which aside from a single movie has never even been mentioned before in media. The intricasy of using a multitude of characters from the Bat family was amazing and while I miss not being able to play in the open world with them I can understand why and it makes sense for the amount of detail already put in the game why the story or the world wouldn't let Nightwing or Catwoman play outside. Yet even with all the negative feedback from other very angry people (which I think you should calm down about and be patient, Rocksteady has been awesome with all their other games the only reason this has a negative review on here is because casual players with simple computers can't process it, not because its actually a bad game), I believe this to be the best Batman Game ever. Plus when this game is released I can't help but be excited for the DLC's to come out with all the bugs fixed. I mean from what I have seen you get to play as ♥♥♥♥ing everyone in the Batman Universe, minus the boring guys like 2 face or Penguin, no offense to them but they just shoot guns and not much else, from Freaking Harley Quinn to Batgirl even to what I assume is Jason Todd. This game has everything I have ever dreamed about since Arkham Asylum and much much more. From playing every character Batman has allied with to taking control of the seriously kickass Batmobile to exploring the gorgeously rendered city of Gotham and the best Batman story to date I think this has hit the top of my list, and while I understand its the final game in the series. I deeply hope Rocksteady pumps out another, or at least of another superhero or anything really because Damn did this game blow me away.",

TL;DR: Do not buy this game for PC. Better on console but even then still buggy. Really disapointed.  Anyway, my story. I was a pre-order of this game, I downloaded day one and tried to start playing. Those of us that remember what that was like, will remember the agony and disappointment. But I knew the problems that the game had, I also knew what a .ini file was. A couple notepad edits later, the game was fixed.  I have no idea why this worked for me, or how. Might have just been my system, or good modifications to the right file. But it was running at a solid 120 FPS and most settings were turned up to high (texture detail was lowered to get rid of some screen tearing).  I loved the game, it was fun. Tank combat was a little out of place but I enjoyed it. One of the few I suppose. It still had a LOT of problems: texture popping, hit detection, combo keys not registering, not to mention stuttering, screen tearing, FPS drops, and Nvidia's additions screwing us AMD users over.  Anyway, I beat it a while back, and moved on. Until recently when all the DLC had come out, and I had a $20 steam code burning a hole in my pocket. So I bought the season pass. I started playing the new game plus. I realized that it was still kinda fun. Then the different realization. NOTHING had changed. My modifications to the .ini file had been overwritten by some of the updates so it ran like a monkey in a bat-diaper. Tank combat was still kinda nice. Combo keys (alt-# is terrible to use as combo's, especially when it takes the blood of a virgin on a blood moon to get them to trigger) were still broken.  When trying to make a person happy, you give them control. Too much control can make people feel overwhelmed, but some control is better than none. New Game plus (NG+ from now on) was going fine. Until I got trapped in a corner repeatedly when special combos refused to execute (my usual virgin was out on buisness, moon was only a blue moon).  Could not change difficulty, could not reload save, could not reset NG+, unable to skip death cutscene (probably my biggest peve of them all, once or twice is alright, makes you madder I get that. However at the five mark it is just annoying)  Not exactly happy, then I noticed something else. Game crashes if you hit too many keys trying to find the key to skip death cutscene.  Thought I would try the Arkham episodes. Broken as the rest of it and even more frustrating (that catwoman robot fight 'boss' is absolute dolphin crap). And the default control hints for the Red Hood story pack were in Play station form.  This may seem like a rant of a frustrated casual. And in part it is, I mostly play the arkham games for story anyway. But when a developer promises support, fails to give it (I know what WB said to all the articles, at about half a year since launch, then it faded away) and then just moves on? Makes me hesitant about future games on the PC, let alone from WB or Rocksteady. Games SHOULDN'T launch buggy. You are not buying a complete product (like a kettle without a handle, I mean it will work but... not what you were looking for), you are buying some big wigs desire to get something released to the ravinous wallets (I was guilty of this, love me some batman, but pre-ordering is not a good thing, but that is another rant).  My point is, I gave you a chance to fix it, I gave you my faith. I have a pile of kettle code that compiles without a handle. And I have a request for a refund from steam (for the seasons pass). PC players are getting shafted of late with buggy console ports and rip-offs. I know we may not be as lucrative as we once were, but we are still a player base.  Don't release dolphin crap, train or release your monkeys, find a PC division and let them work on it with time and dedication (maybe not Iron Galaxy next time) they might produce something that is worth a buy.",

            "review_text": "I'm sure by now you all have experienced/seen/heard about all the technical bugs/glitches/performance issues. I'm not here to talk about that. The fact is Arkham Knight has to be one of the saddest games to grace my library. It's sad because you can see the developers writing themselves into a corner with the story, coming to feel over burdened to incorporate the batmobile into every thing you do, and trying to give you an experience that is far from what batman fans truly wanted. If they had focused on the story and characters more and not even bothered to put in the batmobile they could have focused their time and efforts on the story and performance.  SPOILER ALERT: Joker comes back and the experience with him has got to be the hands down THE GREATEST thing I've ever experienced in a batman game. From the world changing around you, to the joker popping up in places that made me fall out of my chair laughing, Mark Hamill delivers so much to this game. Honestly that's what we all want as batman fans. Nobody cares about the 'plot', it's just white noise to expereince the amazing characters, so to speak its the characters that drive every story line and if the devolopers had just realized this we could have had a great game. Let me be clear here: the overall story isn't good in my opinion. It's long and confusing, had me wondering why they put certain things in, and only had a few, though amazing, memorable moments unlike the past games. The Joker sub-story is what I'm saying made this game for me. SPOILER ALERT: I called the arkham knight being Jason Todd when he was announced. It was so obvious that the whole game I felt it was just a chore getting to the climax. It gets to a point where they beat it over your head that he is Jason. What I'm also trying to say is that Arkham Knight had the potential to be possibly the best batman villian. Imagine everything you have learned over the past 3 games being thwarted by an enemy that knows Batman to his core. They could have blended this psychological aspect with the Joker portion and just UH WHY DIDN'T THEY DO THIS. If they ever do a overhaul of the game completely rework the second half of the game. Instead of the Joker arch ending and the Scarecrow arch going on forever have batman stop the gas bomb, ♥♥♥♥ have the gas bomb go off first thing in the game, Batman and his crew are safe and they save the city but because of so much exposure ot the fear tocxin the Joker comes in DURING THE SECOND HALF AND THE ARKHAM KNIGHT PLAYS ON BATMANS FEAR OF BEING LIKE THE JOKER AND CMON HOW DID THEY NOT SEE THIS.  On the note of characters I have to say graphically I have never been more dissapointed. Honestly if they had just copy and pasted the models from Arkham City it would have been more enjoyable then playing as a gorilla batman, with his skinhead robin sidekick, and a preppy looking nightwing. Gameplay wise another aspect the developers should have focused on was the co-op sections of the game with catwoman, nightwing, and robin. That was all the inovation we needed.  In conclusion the little details really are what you should play this game for. They expanded to far and sacrificed the things that should have been given the most attention. Again I cannot tell you how amazing the joker section of this game is. If you are a huge batman/joker fan PLAY THIS GAME. I would like to mention the level designers did an AMAZING job creating Gotham City. They take in the Tim Burton style over the toppness mixed in with Christopher Nolans run down and grimy of the Dark Knight movies hats off to guys. The Harley Quinn DLC is worth mentioning as an amazing take on the character as a batman lore fan, though short I enjoyed it. Not really a review more like my thoughts and critiques but I hope it helps you on deciding to purchase this game if it ever gets back up on steam.",

Hear people complain a lot about the driving and can understand why they would feel that way but it didn't bother me as much as my friends who played.  What bothered me the most was actually the choices you have to make in this game. Sometimes they give you the illusion of choice and forces you to do what feels to me as 'unbatman-like' and then also gives you the option of actually making choices that somewhat matter. While choices in other games are usually a welcomed mechanic I feel torn about it in this game.  One thing about batman is that he makes the hard moral choices but somehow usually makes it work (It is actually fictional, I know I was so surprised too when I found out it was fake). I don't want to make the hard choices, I just want this to be the batman simulator.  Nearing the end of the game and I just can't continue because it doesn't feel like a batman game anymore.

The detail of the city is astonishing, the character models are amazing, and the overall feel of the city is just incredible. The addition of the batmobile is fantastic while in pursuit mode. Where things get rocky is the Batmobile’s battle mode. The gameplay with this feature is not bad. It just doesn’t feel like Batman, and it is used around every turn. The rest of the gameplay is pretty much what you would expect, more of the same but cooler, and refined to perfection. Gliding is more enjoyable than ever, and side quests are far more satisfying.  The story makes good on Scarecrow’s threats to bring out all of Batman’s worst fears for the world to see. As a result, as a character remarks later, Batman loses his “mystique” that he had in the asylum and arkham city. It effectively delves into Bruce Wayne’s psychology, and at times I even was worried that Bruce was losing his mind. This makes for an exciting plot that is routinely interrupted to make sure players check out the previously mentioned side quests. This keeps the tone uneven. These strange jumps in tone all culminate into an ending which leaves more questions than answers but leaves you thinking about it for hours to come.  It is very much a Batman Arkham game, and it certainly builds on its predecessor in mostly all of the right places. The graphics are amazing, but battle mode can be tiresome, and the ending leaves polarizing opinions as far as satisfaction. In spite of faults it is a superb game and well worth the hefty price. ",

Benchmarked 31min / 73max / 51average.  The game runs good , but in random moments it slowdowns to 20 fps or even lower and without increased complexity in graphics.   So it is bad optimized. Same story as Mortal Kombat X which is almost 3 months old and yet the performance is not as it should be. The good news are that unlike Mortal kombat, decreasing graphics here is affecting performance.  The big letdown is that high end pcs have not as good graphics as PS4 edition. This is serious....  Warner must be serious.... 2 big games - 2 big letdowns.  Stop preordering.... I guess the game maybe be more solid after 6 months..... from me NOT RECCOMENDED yet.",

Sometimes the game starts to slow down, but it's still playable (if annoying) and if it gets too bad I can just hit escape and wait for 5 minutes and then it returns to normal.  That might seem like a really low bar to set for a game, but again, it's a 3 year old laptop that was never a high end gaming computer. I'm honestly surprised it even runs.  The gameplay itself is fun. There is significant reliance on the Batmobile, but I honestly didn't mind that since I enjoy that part of it, and it is possible (and even easier, thanks to the grapnel upgrades) to move around without it. Combat is as good as the Arkham series has ever been, I've never run into pathfinding issues the way I sometimes did with Origins.

I've heard EA Games will produce a fix for this issue in September 2015, why it will take that long is unknown to me. Another owner of the game published a temporary solution in the STEAM COMMUNITY to the problem. Once the game has started change the display to Windowed With Border mode. Alt-tab out and start TASK MANAGER, click the 'Processes' tab and locate and right click 'BatmanAK.exe', click 'Set Affinity' and remove the check mark from 'CPU 1, and CPU 2', click OK, alt-tab back to the game and change the display back to 'FULL SCREEN'. This has allowed me to play the game for hours althought it still locks up from time to time. The game is fun to play. If you like multi-tasking you will love this game since you have several missions going on at the same time. You will often find part of another mission that can be completed on your way to the location of your chosen mission. I recommend this game and the Season Pass.",

But, having said that -- as the game stands now, and has since release.. Its bad folks, Its really bad. Its definitly one of, if not the worst port I've ever had the pleasure of slogging through.  I've still logged probably 50 hours or so, because despite the problems I -do- suffer playing this game (terrible frames, shakey and buggy glitches) I have got it so much sweeter than alot of other people, which is really sad, and disappointing. And personally I was willing to stick it out alittle longer than some because well, I love me some Bat. I wanted this to win so big..  Gameplay isnt bad, they threw in some new things that work pretty well when the game can actually keep up with what your doing. And the story is alright, It starts off pretty strong but then it starts pissin' in the wind &amp; messing everything up. At a certain point the entire plot becomes extreemly predictable, to a point I find myself yelling at the 'worlds greatest detective' to get his head out of his ♥♥♥ &amp; put the damn clues together already..  And the batmobile is fun, really fun........ For awhile.  IF they didnt feel the need to incorperate it in nearly everything you do, it would have been alot more awesome. But for w/e reason they really felt the need to cram the batmoblie down your throat at every turn.  Oh and boss battles, yea you remember those from the previous games right? They were awesome, I know.  Well, thats all been replaced with yep, the batmobile.. There is not a single boss fight that doesnt involve you having to fight the entire thing in the batmoblie.  The game could have been awesome, and despite its very obvious short comings It does still have its moments. For me, at least.  But damn, all In all what a let down.

I have a lot I want to say about this game, but it can be summed up as: If you liked the other Arkham games, then whether or not you like this one will likely be dependent entirely on what you think of the Batmobile.  I personally don't enjoy the Batmobile all that much. I think it is reasonably well implemented, but it is the one part of the game that doesn't make me feel like I'm Batman. And when I think about replaying this game, it is due to Batmobile sections that I feel that I would rather replay Arkham City.  The rest of the game is overall well made, and I've been quite impressed with it. They've added a lot to combat, primarily through new enemy types and behaviors. While some of the additions take a while to get used to, for the most part I think they are good. I also like the environmental takedowns. Team-up combat is also pretty well implemented, and I like those sections a good bit as well.  There is a lot to like here, and my only major issue is I feel that the Batmobile has too much of a part, as I personally don't like it. If you do enjoy the Batmobile, then I imagine you'll enjoy this game tremendously.  I haven't commented on technical issues, as I seem to have mostly been spared them, and I think they'll get them ironed out anyway, so they don't have long-term relevance.",

Rolling around in the Batmobile can be fun, but they should have made it into a separate game, preferably one without all the pesky 'drones' that the player is forced to destroy time and again. Part of the fun of the Batman Arkham series was stealthily swooping around in the shadows. This gets undermined by the addition of the Batmobile as an impregnable fortress on wheels, which devalues both the gliding mode of transport and the dangerousness of street-level hostiles (every baddie gets automagically incapacitated upon coming into contact with the Batmobile).",

As long as you smash your mouse button, Batman will do what needs to be done. You don't need any awareness of what is going around you at all, since Batman just attacks everything before they get to do something. Once in a blue moon someone charges you, but that just resets your combo counter, nothing really happens. I could probably watch TV while playing this game, the fighting is so dumbed down.  The grappling hook would've been cool, if it was like it was in Just Cause 2. Since I've played a lot of Just Cause 2, the limitations of the grappling hook is just annoying. In Just Cause 2 you can grapple wherever you want. In this game, you have select grapple points, and those are the only places you are allowed to grapple. Which seems weird, and pretty unnecessary.  The graphics are OK. It's not very impressive, but it's not bad either. I did however expect more, seeing as the game had quite hight system requirements. Everything is muddied with a horrible film grain you can't turn off, and there's motion blur everywhere. Motion blur is ugly. Same with the film grain. And I honestly expected better graphics from AAA title.  And then we have all the crashes. I've tried giving this game a real chance, but since the game keeps crashing every 5 minutes, I haven't really gotten the chance to give the game a proper play. I've had several freezes and a crash to desktop. All within the 10 first minutes of the game. Good job. And I'll let you know that my computer is more than good enough to run this game on max settings, so it's not because of the hardware.  Use your money on something else.

That being said, on to gameplay: It is definitely the crunchy, flowing combat we've gotten used to in Asylum and City and they've kept the XP breakdown at the end of combat, one of that game's few positive additions to the series. The Batmobile shows up nice and early and steers better than I had imagined it would.  As for spoilers, here you go: - The Joker is dead; you get to cremate him in the intro. Still, you'll hear and see plenty more of him in the game, as between his poisoned blood from City and Scarecrow's fear toxin, he's both got wanna-bes and appears as a hallucination, re-enacting The Killing Joke at one point.

From what I have seen so far, other than the setting and story, there not much different here reguarding game mechanics, but that's not a bad thing. The Batmobile is fun, however with mouse and keyboard the controls are sometimes a bit too touchy. Combat seems easier than previous games so you may want to start on a higher than Normal difficulty.  If you have not played the first two games I suggest you play them first since the story is a very big part of the series and with the poor optimization this could be perfect timing to play the first two games haha. Not many people have had any luck getting this game to run on their PCs due to terrible optimization. Apparently I am one of a lucky few that the game runs very well for. At 1920x1080 with max settings using an AMD FX 8350 and Radeon 7970 along with a 7200 RPM HDD with 128 MB Cache this game runs at about 48 FPS for me on average which is playable. I am using the AMD Batman beta drivers which appears to have helped. I am recommending this game on the basis that the game itself is awesome, but with that being said wait for it to become actually playable.

It only happens when the Batmobile crashes into objects and causes massive special effects, even then it's only for a second, nothing major like videos I've seen on YouTube. I got lucky. The settings are all at highest without Gameworks of course, but I can't tell if the AA even work at all, the image quality is never sharp, anyone else has this problem?  Coming fresh off of The Witcher 3, Batman Arkham Knight just feels so meh. I didn't think about pre-ordering it at first, but seeing the 40% off from GMG, it was tempting. Then again, I got really lucky that I manage to play it well, perhaps I won't in later parts of the game, but I don't feel the need to continue until proper patches are out. Until then, I still need to finish TW3 haha, over 60 hours in and just got to Skellige. Damn Roach for being so stupid.",

I opted for a refund and have patiently waited for them to fix these issues. I have been skeptical as to wether or not they could pull it off, but I decided to bite the bullet and try again as this is a game I had waited to play and have loved the previous installments  With the OCT 28th rerelease of the game I am now playing it lag/stutter free and without the nasty film grain! albiet not at max settings  My rig: ...the important bits.

Samsung SSD 250gb Windows 10  Playing in borderless fullscreen with everything at max except textures, Vsync off in game and on in control panel, all gameworks off except for rain I get a smooth 60fps experience. with textures on high it becomes a mostly 60fps experience with major stutters during batmobile and flying sequences, mostly due to the 3gbvram I imagine, as setting textures to high exceeds the limit by about 500mb.   I understand people with similar or better setups are still getting horrible performance with dips into the 20's and I couldnt tell you why I am not experiencing this, but I am still only 4 hours into the game, maybe something will change and if it does I will update accordingly.",

            "review_text": "What a long and strange trip it’s been from Arkham Asylum to Arkham City, back into the past in Arkham Origins and now for the final confrontation in Arkham Knight.  Let me say that I bought AK after the game had been pulled from stores and was extensively patched. Right now I’m running the game at maximum, including all Nvidia options for rain, etc., which should tax my graphics card to its limits. The game runs mostly fine, however. Yes, there’s some few drops below 60 fps and some micro (or macro) stuttering every time you start the game and summon a certain automobile. No idea, must be assets loading. Sucks either way. Maybe this is remedied if you install this on an SSD. In any case, the game is more than playable right now. At least for me. The game is also just stunning, graphics wise. Gotham never looked better, though it’s hard to understand why the city apparently changed its layout 3 times…  Now, first and foremost, Arkham Knight is a good game all in all. It’s most likely even the best in the series, all considering. It’s not like Arkham Origins just a rehash of the previous game, it is improved (and sometimes made worse) in almost all aspects, so here goes:  Combat: The freeflow system has been further improved, animations are a bit smoother, the flow of combat is a bit better. However, the biggest issue I had with this game was the sometimes insane amount of enemies that get thrown at you, especially those invulnerable enemies that you have to dodge or stun or whatever. That alone wouldn’t be that bad, but the game’s camera does a VERY bad job at giving you enough overview to see exactly what’s going on. Is an enemy about to charge or fire upon you? Which enemy are you even targeting currently? And that’s another thing. One would assume that with 20 enemies present your character would attack the ones who don’t counter you, yet he likes to do that very often, which can literally mean your death when your character suddenly jumps out of view to attack a stun baton guy…Since you can only vaguely dictate which opponent to attack this is unforgivable and I can see this really having a negative effect on a higher difficulty level.  Gadgets: These are pretty much the same, but slimmed down a bit. You now access them via a radial menu instead of the d-pad, which really interrupts the flow of the game. There’s nothing really new here…sadly.  Batmobile: This is THE new feature in AK. You will be using the Batmobile a lot. In puzzles, in combat, in traversal…just about in every situation. You can even remote control it. The Batmobile is cool, but it a bit overused. Also at times it controls absolutely horribly…  Upgrades: The system has been improved in comparison to AC. Of course you also get to upgrade your Batmobile! Getting every upgrade will require you to 3-star all challenges and pretty much complete the game I’d say. I’ve had about 70% of the upgrades at the end of the game I think. They’re mostly not spectacular, but pretty neat.  Enemies: The game adds 3 new enemy types as far as hand to hand combat is concerned, if I remember correctly. There’s the drone commander, who steers a small drone that can detect you, a “big” gunner that can’t be taken out with a silent takedown, which adds a new element to predator missions, and a medic, who can revive fallen enemies. Apart from that there’s the new drone army, which you fight in your Batmobile. Basically 4 or 5 different sorts of tanks. Those tank fights are rather boring and get annoying pretty quickly…sadly.  Collectibles: Yes, Eddie’s back and he’s got a whopping 243 trophies, riddles, destructible objects, etc. in his arsenal. It’s going to take you ages to get them all, but at least the puzzle mechanisms are fresh and new. Too bad you still have to take out the “green” thugs to get more locations. I couldn’t bother. It’s just too much. The sad thing about this is that you not only need to collect EVERYTHING to actually fight the Riddler in this game, but to also unlock the “secret” and final ending…boooooooo. I mean it’s cool to have a reward for those soldiering through all those trophies, but something as essential as a secret ending that completely changes the ending of the game? Meh…  Challenges: These are unlocked during the story mode, but you need to also meet a certain requirement to actually play them, for example, dive for x meters or whatever. The challenges comprise of tutorials as well as combat, predator and batmobile missions, which you can 3-star for an upgrade point. These can also be unlocked and played from the main menu once you have unlocked them. The races are the real highlights here. Those are extremely cool and fun and involve our beloved Edward.  Skins: Once unlocked or purchased via DLC you can actually play as a different incarnation of Batman in the main game (I chose Batman of the Future I think…so edgy and works well with the Arkham Knight). There are also skins for the other playable characters as well as the Batmobile.  Main story: This quest line is epic, you can’t deny that. It’s got everything: drama, action, slow paced segments, more drama and an incredibly good ending. I won’t spoil anything. The Arkham Knight, however, kinda got on my nerves the further the game progressed since he is by far the weakest character in the game, at least later on. He’s just boring and petulant and not really a threat, which was kinda disappointing. He also repeats himself all the time and gets more and more angry…meh.  Side quests: There are quite a few side missions to complete, whether it’s to foil the Penguin or Two-Face, a cult preacher, a serial killer, etc. All of these missions are usually unlocked at a certain point in the game. Only the “destroy this, destroy that” missions I had to find myself more or less. The most intriguing story line is probably revolving around the Riddler, who captured poor poor Catwoman. This quest comprises of a series of riddles, challenges and races, however, Eddie will get on your nerves sooner or later. There’s only so much “herpa derpa, I’m smarter than you, you can never solve all my riddles” banter you can take…especially after having played all 4 games in a row…  Bosses: This is probably THE weakest part of the game, because it doesn’t involve a single boss fight. Yep, that’s right. Sorry to spoiler this, but I think it’s huge. “Boss fights” in AK consist of either a) AC side mission style with an endless number of minions and the boss fighting with the group, having a health bar…b) that boss being a big ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who can only be damaged after hitting a few of the smaller minions and performing a “team takedown” or c) a tank battle. After the phenomenal boss fights of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City this is a REAL letdown…  Verdict: Good game with some improvements, but also some letdowns. Great story, good gameplay, fun elements, but a lack of diverse and interesting boss fights hurts it real bad. Get it for the conclusion of the epic storyline.  DLC: See individual story DLCs, since steam thinks this is already too long. Once again you can't change the difficulty in the DLCs...bummer. Have fun dying if you like to play on easy.",

I decided to wait until it was fixed and put back on sale, only to hear of people still complaining of problems. But with WB offering a full refund, I decided to go ahead and bite the bullet, figuring the worst case scenario would be if it sucked and I got the refund, I could put it towards the purchase of Fallout 4.  Well guess what? It plays awesome! Yes, even the Batmobile! Combat and movement were silky-smooth, with nary a graphic hitch in sight. And I played it on my monitor's native resolution (1680x1050), which I think helped in the FPS department.  In case you're wondering about my specs, here they are:  Intel core i7 CPU (factory setting) nVidia GTX 970 8 Gb of Crucial Ballistix system RAM Windows 8.1 ASUS Sabretooth Z97 Mk 1 Motherboard  If your system is anything like mine, you should be golden. Although I suppose I should mention that you may want to run nVidia's GeForce Experience program to properly optimize your game. Interestingly enough, it does not enable the graphical bells and whistles like enhanced rain or interactive smoke. And I think that's where people may be encountering problems. But the game itself just looks so gorgeous as-is that I don't think you'll miss them.  As with Mortal Kombat X, it paid to hold off until things were fixed. But hopefully WB will learn their lesson from this after such a public debacle.  That having been said, at this point I think many of the complaints are coming from a small, vocal minority. Namely, either hardcore PC enthusiasts and tech-heads who have everything on their machines turned up to eleven, Windows 10 users complaining about the memory requirements, or - even worse - trolls just looking to kick WB when they're down 'for the lulz.' Given the current 'mixed' status the game has been receiving, that's a big step up from the 'mostly negative' status it had at first. And I feel that there's probably a silent majority for whom the game runs fine.  So, in closing, to those of you who have a rig like mine and running under the same OS, you ought to be fine. For those still complaining? To paraphrase Jay-Z, 'If you're having game troubles, I feel bad for you son. I've got 99 problems, but Batman ain't one!'",

I understand Asylum/City were similar in nature, but in this game, it's more prevalent.  -No boss fights. Come on, now! There are no boss fights whatsoever, except maybe during one side mission, but there's nothing here.  -Lack of stealth. I remember when Asylum emphasized stealth gameplay. That's completely out of the window in this game. It almost feels casualized with the 'fear' takedowns.  -Shelved content for DLC. Don't be cheap, WB.  -Lack of interior levels. Barely any.  -Basic enemy types. I could have sworn there were more enemy types in the previous games.  The story is also lackluster and predictable. It's honestly not that great. Scarecrow is a very threatening villain in Arkham Asylum, due to his fear hallucinations. But in this game, he's all talk. All those cool moments in Asylum where you're hallucinating out of nowhere is out of the picture.   Anyway, I'm not going into spoiler territory, but technical issues aside, the game is a mess. There's a conflict of vision in this game that sacrificed stealth gameplay and interior level design for the Tankmobile. For this to be the third entry, it clearly shows how 'lazy' things were implemented. This game actually makes me appreciate Arkham Asylum and Origins more for the sake of stealth and bosses.",

Really if you see something with the WB games brandmark you can assume that it's probably amazing on console, and horrible on PC because they always give their PC Port developers very small windows.  It's a wonder anyone wants to work with them.  Thanks to Anna Kushina for pointing this review out to me so I could update it.  Original:  This game is pretty awesome. I have not had any of the issues other people were listing but perhaps those were fixed before I made my purchase.",

'Nuff said. - Interesting story line (So far) - Fancy GUIs for the eye. Easy to use too. - The Riddlers Riddles are harder then before, making it more fun  Cons: - Performance issues, which is the most common - Minor glitches, such as the batmobile glitching back a little sometimes - The 30 FPS patch. Rlly? - Batmobile combat gets repetive - (Will update more if I see any cons.. so far not!)  I reccommend this game if you're interested in after the patch.",

I was legitimately excited when the first trailer popped out on my notifications. Seeing Batman for the last time in an Arkham game gives me so much hype. I've completed all the past Arkham games at 100%.   Arkham Knight is a wonderful goodbye to a brilliant franchise! The recent controversy of its bad PC port didn't stop me from completely accepting the game for what it is. It had a good story, integrated gameplay and it's the most Batman game since City. Rocksteady ♥♥♥♥ed up, I know. But I know they're cool so after patches and patches, I decided to finally buy the game on sale. I played the Bootleg version and it was pretty slow for my low-range PC. Anyway, I bought the Premium Edition containing all DLC's at a reasonable price.   Can't say I have never enjoyed a game like this before. It's filled with action, tension and Scarecrow's brilliant voice actor.   I replayed this game for 3 times and both playthroughs I had to fully achieve the Knightfall Protocol.   10/10 would play this game again.",

WARNING, HERE THERE BE SPOILERS  So I waited since day one for the patch, and now that I've gotten 100% on normal difficulty, I have to say: I had some problems with Arkham Knight, but it wasn't enough to keep me from liking it. Probably the last Warner Brothers game I'm picking up considering the big fiasco regarding this port, but at least it seems they took/are taking the time to address our grievances.  + The visuals are GORGEOUS, if the Youtube channel BatmanArkhamVideos is any indication (seriously, I envy them); the character animation in particular is wonderfully fluid and damn near lifelike, leagues ahead of the stiff mannequin-like motions in cutscenes in prior Arkham games. (Not that there aren't occasional oddities though.) + The combat and predator gameplay is just sublime, with lots of new tricks and twists added in (I had a blast with the Fear Takedowns, for instance). It's more difficult, but more satisfying IMO. + Very memorable side missions, especially the Perfect Crime one. + Great voice acting, not to mention Kevin Conroy stepping up his game after being so wooden in Arkham City. + Scarecrow is best villain. Like, really. Not to mention what he does in the finale proves he's worthy of being one of the A-listers in the Dark Knight's rogues gallery. I'm also glad that Hallucination!Joker, even with all his screentime, was kept somewhat to the sidelines plotwise, being an entirely internal conflict for Batman; the plot makes it clear that Scarecrow and Arkham Knight are the main threats in play here. + The Batmobile and Bat-Tank were decent enough. Though the tank is a bit...iffy in terms of lore, I can give that some leeway for the satisfying gameplay.  +/- Running this on my machine, I don't get 60fps that often, and the game lags sometimes (especially during car chases and going through places with tons of NPCs). But for me, it runs well and consistently so; with all that's happened regarding this port, that's really all I can ask for.  - The AR Challenges got old after a little while. I kind of miss the way the other games did it, featuring setpiece moments as replayable challenges. (Like, you could have the airship cargo hold as a combat challenge, or the last room in Arkham Knight HQ as a Predator challenge, for instance. But nope.) - Paul Dini isn't present, and it shows. The plot, while otherwise decent and has a spectacular finale, seems to rely too heavily on kidnappings to keep things moving along and gets a tad repetitive. - Arkham Knight's identity being obvious, of course, both in-game and out. And also not being an original character. (Technically, they were right in that it's a new IDENTITY, but...) - Azrael and Hush/The Identity Thief were utterly wasted, and we never got to see Jack Ryder as The Creeper. The hell?  Verdict: Uh...mixed feelings, but leaning towards positive. If you like the Arkham series, have a higher-end machine, and are interested in this game, I'd at least think about it. I have definite reservations about buying it right off the bat though. I'd try the console version first if you can, to see what you think of it.",

Though Origins is the black sheep of the series for most players (only because it's not a Rocksteady game), I still personally advice to play Origins rather than Arkham Knight, for those who didn't played it yet. The game is pretty good and the PC port is fine. I personally liked Origins a lot more than Arkham City.  In my two majors reasons, batmobile one is the worst one. The PC port is still playable at 30fps, and I guess the port will be patched, sooner or later.  If you really want to buy it, I would advice to wait until a sale with a very low price (like 75% off).  It's too bad because, without the batmobile, it would have been a pretty good game (PC port aside).  Edit : PC port is now better with the last patchs, game run at constant 60fps with a GTX 970 if you disable nvidia effects. However, I still don't recommend the game for one of the same reason explained upper, too much batmobile which make the game pretty boring.",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty incredible. So far its a suitable finale to the Arkham Trilogy. There are a few hiccups. There is a lot of Batmobile-focused combat, so if you don't like the Batmobile, you're in for a long night. There is less focus, I feel, on melee combat as well. As someone who enjoyed beating up a horde of 40 goons single-handedly in Arkham City, I miss the melee combat. The much-touted 'dual play' system has, so far for me, only appeared in one main questline and one side mission, even though I'm now in the third act of the game. Still, the Gotham City in this game is, in my opinion, the best Rocksteady has ever created. The aesthetic of the city is different then Origins or City, a bit brighter and more chaotic, but it looks gorgeous. The Batmobile, overall, is a bit hard to control but I found it fun once I got the hang of it. The voice acting is superb, as always, as are the Predator encounters. Unfortunately, I still cannot reccomend this game, even though I'm finding it thoroughly enjoyable. The only reason I've been able to play this far is that I got lucky. I've been able to play at 35-50 fps pretty consistently, with the occasional drop to around 25-30 when using Grapnel Boost, or in the middle of intense melee combat. I'm using a GTX 760 with an i5-3570k CPU. I installed this game on my SSD after finding it entirely unplayable on my HDD. I cannot hit 60 fps in this game in 1080p, and that is UNACCEPTABLE. Other users are unable to stay above 30 fps with hardware that is signifcantly better than mine. I'm incredulous that, in 2015, a major games publisher like WB Games is incapable of releasing a game that runs at 1080p, 60 fps on hardware that is more powerful than a PS4. Speaking of PS4, the PS4 version of this game contains Ambient Occlusion effects, while the PC version doesn't. Rocksteady has just publicly announced that this game was designed to run at the same graphical level as modern game consoles. In other words, this game is not going to look or run better than a machine which was years out of date when it was released. WB and Rocksteady's behavior regarding this game has been abhorrent. I would refund my game if I could, even though I am able to play it, but I purchased it on Green Man Gaming and can't get a refund. I'm afraid that we've lost a once respected developer and publisher to the easy money on consoles. This is the last time I will preorder a game by either of these two companies.

At this point, Arkham Knight performs fairly respectably - certainly not the worst game on PC in that regard - with all the settings you'd expect to see, and the game itself is quite fun, especially the latter half which features less shoehorned Batmobile sections (though still lots of Batmobile combat). I quite liked it at the end of the day, even if I maintain that it's the weakest in the series (excluding Blackgate).  Skip the season pass, though, unless it's steeply discounted. Half of the expansion content is very good, but all of the standalone missions are the worst they could possibly be. No effort, they're basically just a series of connected challenge rooms with a few voice clips to create some meager sense of 'plot' because people only really want story DLC. It's the poster child for exploitative DLC practices which, frankly, I think in general are a vastly overstated problem. This is one of the few times I've really had an issue with DLC but wow did Rocksteady mess up. And then to charge $40, 2/3 the price of the actual game, for that non-content is just offensive. Do get the Season of Infamy pack, The Freeze and League of Assassins missions are worth experiencing, but the rest of the season pass content leaves a sour taste.",

They also don't interfere with the story; it doesn't seem like the game gets too pushy.  Some don't like the Batmobile concept, some do. Personally, the Batmobile is awesome. The tank battles get a bit repetitive but driving around in the chases are fun. Note however, the chases are still difficult to play because of frame stutters.  General consensus, this game is super fun and well written for the story, but isn't worth the full $60 since it just isn't optimized for the PC.

With that in mind I would highly recommend the game (once in a working state!). It has a gripping story from the get go and the map is huge. I felt at times it focussed a little too much on the batmobile but this was indeed their gimmick for the game so I can gloss over it. There are some awesome moments in the game and you get to see some villains that you havn't before in the arkham games.  Gameplay wise its just like any other Arkham game so you know what to expect. There are a few more abilities and gadgets added to the mix which typically come with progression of the main story.  Technical issues aside I would give this game a 9/10.  Obviously WITH the technical issues for many people its a 0/10 because its unplayable.

Combat is just as good as the other batman games, and the combos seem to be not as clunky as Origins Detail is phenominal! you can see ripples in batmans cape.  once the 30fps can be changed, im sure it will look even better.

The two fights near the end topped the peak of some of the worst fights in a game because they force you into these really terribly contrived situations, you have to use the batmobile, and the fights are like if you beat the soul out of a Zelda Boss fight....I'm serious. Do this thing three times and win.  All the other mechanics were, well, boring after the 20th time you used them....and I just don't know; maybe the series is losing its luster. Maybe we've tapped _ to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of one too many bad guys, but something about this game went from the 'Oh, We're in Batman-universe, fighting the iconic villians' to some kind of badly done generic military-based stealther.

If you don't want to drop $600 on a graphics card the ps4 version is very comparible in looks and works great and a Ps4 is most likely cheaper than the hardware upgrade you might need to have a smooth gameplay experience with this.

The Batmobile was an amazing adition and the huge map compliments it well. I think that the new upgrade screen is much better organized than that of the previous games and makes it less frustrating all together. The new combat abilities and the tag-team-esqe like fighting is incredible smooth and very satisfying to execute dual takedowns with Batman and Robin. Surprisingly my favorite part of the story is the Joker's constant insults and jokes. Overall I really enjoy the game, but I can understand the bad ratings if you have had performance issues. In my opinion Arkham Knight is up there with Arkham City with the oportunity to even exceed it depending on the upcoming DLC.",

There's a few bugs, and a lot of users are reporting some game-breaking stuff (I've had none of the major issues, and the game performed pretty well for 30+ hours. The first patch broke the main menu's framerate for me though), but Arkham Knight is well worth experiencing.  Arkham Knight takes the series' excellent combat and stealth mechanics and improves on them in virtually every way. The biggest new feature is the Batmobile, and it feels like you're using it as much as you're travelling on foot. This makes it feel less gimmicky than it otherwise would have been, but I feel as though it's relied on a little too much. When it transforms into a tank and you're taking down unmanned drones, the game feels significantly less like a Batman game. That being said, it keeps things from getting stale.  The story is fantastic, and easily the best in the series. I won't spoil anything here, but Rocksteady and the excellent cast of voice actors (including John Noble's absolutely perfect performance as Scarecrow) have really outdone themselves. There's one big plot point that falls a little flat, but the rest of the game more than makes up for it. You do have to finish every side mission to see the ending (yes, that includes over 200 Riddler trophies/challenges!), but most of them are entertaining and well put together. The sections with Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing assisting you are great fun.  At time of writing, the Harley Quinn story is the only DLC available outside of a few skins, and whilst it feels unique (Harley's version of Detective Mode is extremely well done), it can be finished in about 15 minutes. Still, it provides a short prequel story of sorts, as opposed to just being challenge maps like the Robin and Nightwing DLC from Arkham City. Speaking of which, there aren't any challenge maps in this game - there's 23 ranked challenges, but they're not confined to separate maps. They all take place within Gotham City.  Overall, a great game, well worth playing, and a top contender for Game of the Year. Well, maybe runner-up to The Witcher 3 anyway :p",

Even stranger, it seems that reducing any of the settings actually made the game run slower. So I played through it, gave it about 40 hours of my time, and here's what I've learned:  1. The tank battles are amazing. But there are far too many of them. Upgrading feels empowering and never like a chore, and however unrealistic and un-Batmanlike it may be, just charging through the city, pedestrians, cars, and all, feels great.  2. He's the same old Batman. In nearly every way. Nothing fazes him, and he's rarely faced with defeat. And he's about as stiff as he's always been. This can be a good thing, but sometimes one wishes for a bit of narrative (and aesthetic) variety.  3. Which brings us to the aesthetics. Somehow, being able to play at max settings with a decent FPS (most of the time), Gotham City is without a question the best playground Rocksteady has given their players. It is way more immersive by means of the living, breathing menu system with absolutely TONS to do anywhere you look, and because of the impressive roster of villains they have you interact with (read: beat up). This is wondrous for the lore, and there are an infinite number of references to Batman stories past. The city is always rainy, dark and gritty, but also bright and neon, shiny and reflective. Even the smallest details will be appreciated. The Batman series (minus Origins, I don't know what that was) has been known for introducing hundreds of marginally small changes instead of a few huge ones, and this is true here. You're getting a similar experience design- and graphics-wise, but it's satisfying.  Bottom line, it was an enjoyable experience to play this game, but the changes to come with the update (whenever that will be) will be much appreciated.",

            "review_text": "Okay, so there's a lot of bad publicity surrounding Batman: AK, and much of it rightly so, but I want to focus on the game itself and not jump on the 'my AAA game is broke' bandwagon.   I've got nearly 20 hours in on a PC with little to no problems with the game graphically speaking - granted, I have not performed any benchmarking, frame tracking, etc but I have yet to run into any fatal crashing, lock-ups, or freezes. I will post my computer hardware at the end of this review.  The game is introduced in a stunningly beautiful way and completely captures the player's attention - after the diner I couldn't wait to experience play under the mantle of the Dark Knight. I am no stranger to the Arkham series and any player who has experience in any of the previous games will very quickly adapt to combat mechanics, traversing across the city, and solving the game's puzzles (often in the form of the Riddler's obstacles). Veteran players will also readily recognize Riddler trophies and puzzles, and the subtle hints through the use of Batman's audio monitoring system.   The game features some new additions, most notable of which is the Batmobile - personally I was cautiously optimistic about this addition as there is a certain aura of reverance engulfing this particular vehicle. However, as exciting as it can be to finally drive the Batmobile Rocksteady seems to force its use onto players in a nagging way rather consistently - it is noticeably clumsy, its use can slow down gameplay (in terms of time, not graphics), and frequently its use is just absurd. There is one particular Riddler puzzle that comes to mind that requires the use of the Batmobile and while the puzzle itself is intriguing, I literally facepalmed at how far Rocksteady went to forcibly incorporate the Batmobile in the riddle... let alone the rather silly Riddler races. The whole idea of a Riddler race track, while meagerly fun, simply does not mesh with the Batman atmosphere or the Riddler's theme. The Batmobile's remote feature acts to compound the vehicle's necessity and while the car won't fire on Batman... it will fire on police cars. Further, it is nearly impossible to destroy (at least, in part) Gotham City in some fashion while driving around - in fact, the destruction is so noticeable that makes the player question just how committed Batman is to actually protecting the city. Speaking of protecting Gotham City, some of the game's sidequests virtually destroy the city and after a while the player starts wondering just how much city will be left standing after Batman 'defends' it.   The upgrade (or talent) system is similar to previous installments with many of the same upgrades taken from similar titles (added armor, reduced combo requirements, etc) and combat mechanics are nearly identical with the exception of dual take-downs which can be exciting but are really only implemented in specific areas with a number of enemies to fight. Also, the game introduces added environmental interaction during combat sequences: Batman can throw a thug into electrical panels, actuate security systems to isolate thugs, and he can perform vehicle take-downs... that is, he can glide onto of a car and throw the driver out similar to what is seen in the movies and cartoons. There are also a few new gadgets at Batman's disposal but they are rather seldomly used.   Perhaps the game's biggest problem is repetition. While the game does offer hours and hours of side missions and dialogue, much of this is completed in the same basic formula... fight off a number of drone tanks in the Batmobile (nearly always the same engagement), chase down Firefly (its only enjoyable the first time), or simply brawl against an increasing number of thugs, militia, and automated guns. After a while, you just want the achievement because you feel you've already completed the task two dozen times.   Now, what the game does get right is story telling and it is very clear where directors Bruce Timm &amp; Paul Dini leave their mark. For the sake of spoilers, I won't say too much, but if you are a fan of the cartoon series you will easily recognize many story elements. Also, there is a specific narration that never gets old and I am personally glad to have it - it simply wouldn't be an Arkham game without it. While I think about it, there is one particular 'rescue' mission in the Gotham Movie Studios during which I refused to progress - I just sat back and enjoyed the ambience. If you are a fan of the villian, you will too. Scarecrow also adds quite an intimidating element to the game, but John Noble's Australian accent clearly beams through many times in the game.   In short, the game hardly revolutionizes any mechnic and often times stumbles along in what new features the game adds.   All in all, I'd likely give the game 7/10.

The character Arkham Knight is more annoying than anything else and his identity becomes clear far before it's actually revealed.

I bought the game and the season pass so I paid $90 and unlike many others I didn't think it was too much to ask for the content that they promised. Where they went wrong is when their support team treated me like a child and flat out refused to support this broken pos. Here is a verbatim quote from WB support from one of the emails they sent to me, 'If after doing these steps you are still running into issues then we will not be able to offer anymore assistance for this issue'. I responded and asked them if they were refusing to support the game that I just paid $90 for and they responded by telling me to ask for a refund which I did.

Instead of giving appology WB bans people with pathetic excuses.  And instead of firing those cheap monkey coders who ruined origin and knigh already and giving pc version to Rocksteady, WB just gave extra month to same idiots who was not able properly code this game, and guess what? After so many months they still was not able to fix it! Actually for me last 2 patches made it worse, now i have audio drop outs, very jerky performance and freezes up to BSOD. Game totally have not streaming issues it havenot 2 patches ago. Also new patches introduced a lot of corrupted textures and i think they DOWNGRADED graphics, i notticed that video calls are not prerendered with low quallity, i was pretty sure that before last 2 patches calls was real time and quallity was better (there was no shadow\\occlusion flickering and compression artefacts).  Game itself is very dumbed down and streamlined and less immersive comparing to 1st 2 games. Instead of real time gadged selection with dpad we had before now we have intrusive anti immersive weapon wheel, UI is very intrusive and this time around there is no option to turn off all of these casual indicators like counter icon, granade, tank strike trajectory (this is beyond stupid - you know seconds ahead where they are going to strike and they are slow to do that) and most stupid addition - red highlight of vents in vision cone of guards. They also dumbed down combat, now its not even challenging, you are super fast - taking down like 20 soldiers in few seconds, and you move unrealistically fast and long. Hook became way too long as well, there no challenge now even in gliding and climbing. Damn, even turrets and guns needs to shoot you a lot to actually kill you! Core mechanics of previous games simply ruined!  But whats ruins game even more is that forced batmobile. Well we all dreamed about it in batman game, but not about the way it implemented in game. Instead of giving us real gta like expierience in living ghotam they just give us a toy car with awful physics and controls (which is also the reason on foot controls was altered badly) and built whole city and most of indoor locations around forced usage of this batmobile with very streamlined generic elements and mechanics that getting old very soon and you are starting to feel like you dont want tot use batmobile, but they force you no matter what. Even riddler puzzles now involve it. And this forcing steals from core batman mechanics. Tank mode is totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is really hate it, racing sequences feels very generic and cheap. While technically alls the destruction looks impressive, in terms of gameplay its just looks boring and uninspired.  To be honnest whole GHotam city design totally makes no sense, it does not look like real city, like arkham city looked, it looks more like toy city with generic patterns to make everything pre-calculated and precicely connected to each other, Its like LEGO CITY! And they used cheap plot excuse to populate whole city with thugs YET AGAIN and remove any civilians from area. It all just feels so far fetched, so unbeilievable fake and empty.  Whole game feels convoluted, packed up with uncessary stuff. There is so many of such stuff so its streamlined, repetive and generic as hell, feels like Assassin Creed \\ Ubisoft syndrom totally sucked up this game. Some devs dont get that quantiy does not mean quality.   Oh, while stealth was always week in implementation (because streamlined and generic, yeah) in previous games, there still was few moments where it was fun and very intensive challenge. I have not seen any tension or challenge like that in this game, stealth is way too primitive and easy in this part and kind lacking depth and variability. So yeah, they even managed to ruin stealth. Thanks to bat mobile and streamlined in-box way of thinking.  Even puzzles was dumbed down and does not involved any bits of thinking now.  Whole game just feels like it tries to be even more accessible than before and want to show a grand scale, but thanks to lack of time and resources they just used streamlining as shortcuts for everything, and to show hell lot of things they just imbalanced game with overpowered features like new suit, batmobile, all kind of gadgets. I feel like superman and not like batman now and i feel super borred and dissapointed.  So, even without technical issues this game would be like 6-7 of 10. I think even Arkham Origin was better, because at least it did not ruin original core mechanics like Knight did.",

            "review_text": "NOTE: For those wondering, I am playing this game on a severely under-spec laptop that does NOT meet the minimum system requirements listed on the store page. As such, I consider 25-30fps an acceptable performance, though I wouldn't if I was playing on a higher-spec machine. My review is labelled positive for this reason, in addition to really enjoying the game; please read this note before unnecessarily downvoting my review.  Batman: Arkham Knight is the third and final entry into Rocksteady's universally acclaimed Batman: Arkham trilogy. The high quality of the previous two entries by Rocksteady (Arkham Asylum and Arkham City) means Arkham Knight has a lot to live up to, especially so since it's the last Arkham game we're going to see; fortunately, it lives up to expectations in every regard. Storywise (avoiding spoilers), the game has you playing as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Gotham on Halloween night, when the Scarecrow threatens the entire city with his fear toxin, thus forcing the city to evacuate. His plan to drown the entire city in fear with the help of his mysterious ally known as the Arkham Knight is Batman's biggest threat yet, and makes for some pretty excellent storytelling; Rocksteady again display their maturity in regards to telling a good story, as there are plenty of compelling emotional moments and the Arkham Knight's reveal is an impressive display of narrative prowess. The Joker's death in the previous game lingers over the characters and makes for some very dark and engrossing storytelling. The open-world of Gotham is also the most impressive map out of all the Arkham games; the entire map is open to the player right from the start, and the densely-packed cityscape makes it a perfect urban playground for Batman's activities. It is obvious that a great deal of love and care has been placed into designing this interpretation of Gotham, meaning players get to experience an open world that has a significant personality of its own. Gameplay from the previous games has been polished and reworked extensively. The usual rhythmic melee battles are here in fine form, with Batman's punches, kicks and counters all feeling very tight and responsive. Nobody has mastered this kind of melee combat like Rocksteady, who have had two previous games to refine this formula into their most efficient yet. There are a solid variety of gadgets on display, with both old and new devices joining the fray for use in both combat and puzzle-solving. The newest gadget I should mention is the Batmobile; an all purpose vehicle and tank that the player can use to speedaround Gotham and engage in firefights with other vehicles. I was worried how the inclusion of a vehicle would translate to this game, but I was pleasantly surprised by the way the Batmobile had been integrated into the gameplay. The driving handles very well, the tank battles are a hell of a lot of fun, and the puzzles involving the vehicle require just as much thought as the ordinary ones. In short, gameplay is polished and solidly refined, and is easily the best Arkham game for this very reason.  I should mention the controversial performance issues that have been plaguing this game since its launch; many users have reported the game unplayable, but on my under-spec machine I maintained a stable 25-30 fps for the duration of the game. I have no complaints performance wise, but I can easily understand those who have. In conclusion, Batman: Arkham Knight is my favourite Arkham game and a stunning end to such a fabled trilogy of games. The strong narrative in combination with perfected gameplay makes this a solid choice for GOTY 2015, and is one of those unforgettable games that reminds you why you began playing video-games in the first place. Highly and thoroughly recommended.",

            "review_text": "~~~This game was reviewed on a GTX 1070, 32GB DDR4 RAM @ 2400MHz, i7 6820HK @ 3.8GHz~~~  ---   Oh, how this game loves you... and hates you, too.   Oh, how at times its gameplay is masterful with such refined adeptness, but then so repetitively boring and frustrating. Oh, how the story is so intricate, nuanced, and deliciously brooding and yet full of cliche teen-angst and predictable-ness with ample clout for eye-rolling. Oh, how the visuals cascade your eyes with splendor, until the damn game crashes on you,... again.   I really love this game; I really hate this game, too. It's a crazy and yet totally sane dichotemy.   No spoilers ahead, but a few points to illustrate the above preamble.   1) Vehicle combat just blows. Sure, it's fine for about 30 minutes, but becomes such a chore late in the game, it completely detracts from the brilliance of being Batman. Did I mention being Batman is brilliant? Yes, it most certainly is. Unfortunately, this brilliance is marred by You being the Batmobile as much as You being the Batman. Point: the Batman is awesome; the Batmobile sucks.   2) The Arkham Knight, while a new character (sort-of) in the Batman cannon, is a lame-♥♥♥ villain, especially so when the plot finally culminates to his reveal. Even considering this is a video game based on a comic, the amazingly ludicrous lengths this character goes to annihilate the Batman (and where did he even get the money to invest in an ENTIRE army seemingly the size of North Korea's?), is borderline comical, especially once the 'reveal' happens. Color me critical, but I just can't look past the melodramatic teen-ansty-ness of the Arkham Knight. But! Minding this aside, the story is quite entertaining, with concise and to the point cutscenes that continually drive the momentum of the story (until the Arkham Knights talks...some more). It's as if the game appreciates your curiosity and intellect to piece together and predict the direction of the story to only slap you in the face with another bantering, banal commentary by the Arkham Knight. Point: the story is great; the Arkham Knight pretty much sucks.   3) This game is gorgeous. Like (and I usually don't start sentences with 'like') it's absolutely stunning. The character animations from lip-syncing to body-movement and fluidity of combat are simply phenominal (2015/2016 standards). Even though the game takes place at night, the city streets are dazingly detailed and there are so many nuanced atmospheric effects on screen, it's a relentless avalanche of visual-splendor. And yet, even after the debauched luanch over a year ago, the game crashes, and regularly. Sure, when it's running, it runs well, but I experienced a crash every 20 or so minutes of gameplay - far, FAR too often. Point: it's visually stunning; it also crashes A LOT!  So, how in the Gotham (notice I replaced 'world' with Gotham, because I'm clever) does this game fair? Well, despite its clear shortcomings, it's still oh-so-good... until it's oh-so-bad.   I can so recommend this game, until I don't want to anymore! I'm flummoxed. Perhaps you will be, too, or won't?!?",

As one of the apparently few people who was able to run this game, albeit with some frame-rate and audio syncronisation issues, from the original launch date in June I would like to congratulate the team for the multi-monitor support. I've been stunned by how many AAA titles are locked to 1920x1080 resolutions, even when having options for larger resolutions (Dead Rising 3, I'm looking at you). Arkham Knight worked right out of the box and had no issue reducing screen size down to 1980x1080 for the pre-rendered cutscenes.   It's truly tragic that this game will always have such a bad reputation on PC, even once it's been fully fixed, but I hope publishers learn from this and start doing QA properly.

It would drop down to between 50-60fps in the batmobile, and when flying, lowest it dropped to was around the mid 40s.  I actually really enjoyed the game, the graphics are very good, the texture quality and detail are some of the best I've seen. Gameplay its basically the same as all the other Arkham games, but with more gadgets, the batmobile was fun to drive, and flying around gotham is also fun. The story I liked, the Joker was brilliant, some of the story is predictable, but I enjoyed it.  The only thing I didn't like about this was the Riddler, that is the only thing what stopped me from going for a 100% clear, theres nothing wrong with it, I just cant be bothered to look for all the trophies and do all the riddles.   I would recommend this game, because the game itself I thought was really good, if you can handle it being 60fps 90% of the time, and have a fairly decent PC then I say get it, but i'd say wait for it to go on sale, I wouldn't want to pay £30 for this knowing how it was released in the first place.",

Gameplay: I know that the Batmobile has been wanted, but there was far too much emphasis on it, especially during boss fights. In an effort to introduce the Batmobile into the Arkham Universe, Rocksteady overused it. Arkham City had some very memorable boss fights (e.g. Mr.Freeze) and Arkham Knight just doesn't match that same intensity.  Overall it's a great game, but it left me wanting more Arkham City-type boss fights.",

While that is a cool move, and I can replay the phenominal Asylum and City (which I first played through on Playstation at a friend's house), as while as the less phenominal Origins/Blackgate(once again, friend's house), this port is still extremely broken, and as someone who bought both the game and the season pass (a mistake I thought was safe to make, seeing how Rocksteady had never let me down in the past, and a mistake I will never make again), this saddens me immensely. The writing is also surprisingly weak for an Arkham game with there being only one saving grace in that department, *spoilers*   Mark Hammil's Joker, which is phenominal  , and the combat is more of the other Arkham games, with a stupid Batmobile gimmick shoehorned in. I forced myself through this mess of a game, and while the game is at least playable know, it's still deeply flawed, and I strongly reccomend you don't. You want a good Batman game? Play Batman: Arkham Asylum or Batman: Arkham Knight. Or better yet, go play Gotham City Impostors. It's free on Steam, and in my opinion, the best Batman game of all time.

Rocksteady has a very high standard, and Warner Bros wouldn't let Rocksteady delay the game much more, so they delayed the game only 2-3 weeks which shows that the devs where so desperate, they hired a third party company (Iron Galaxy) to make a PC port with 3 months to go. I would be fine if they delayed the game a full year after the original release date so that all 3 versions of the game would work. But Warner Bros realized that Arkham is a hugely profitable IP and releases games a 1/4 done along with $40 season passes with 15 minute story dlcs and 40 skin packs.  But the game itself. I feel that Batman: Arkham Knight is the single best Arkham game out of all 4. The story (even though the Arkham Knight is predictable to those who read into the comics, or know the basics of forshadowing) is the best in the series with so many twists and turns that you'll never guess what will happen next. The gameplay is awesome and improves everything from the earlier games. Many people say that the Batmobile ruined the entire game. I disagree but I think that the Batmobile is a personal prefrence. The Battle Mode may not make sense to some, but if Batman can blow up cars with the Tumbler, Bat-Pod, and the Bat in the dark knight movies and have even more of a tank in The Dark Knight Returns, then this will work. This is an awesome game, but surrounded with corrupt Publisher infecting with PC ports and $40 season passes.",

I ran it on a pretty high end PC and installed it on an SSD, I7 processor, GTX 970 GPU, 16 GBs of ram. I did have a few crashes, but not at a rate where it got annoying. Randomly it would lagg pretty crazy during cutscenes and stuff.   But one thing I would recommend if you are getting this for the PC, do use a controller, especially during the Batmobile fights and even then I bet its pretty bad. especially towards the end there is are 2 really big battles that you do in the Batmobile and I had to pause a couple of times during it because your wrist will get torn up turning around like a crazy person fighting enemies coming at you from all sides constantly.  EDIT: One thing I found completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. os that there is absolutely no hint at where or when you can find the Freeze Grenade or w/e its called. You can find it on a small table in the first room with the cells at the studios.  If WB wouldn't have cheaped out and put a company most people have never heard of in control of the PC port creation, I bet this could have been a great release, but ♥♥♥♥ happens.

I just turned off all Nvidia specific graphic options (lighting, fog, water, the other thing) and it looks no different graphically and run so much better now. The story has me captivated and the side quests are just so much fun to do. I hate not being able to do some of them, but I know it's good not to rush them. Just roaming in the Batmobile and taking out cars and thugs is a blast by itself. Amazing game really (if you can get it to run). Game, graphically, looks just a bit better than Origins in my opinion and still looks amazing to my eye (with the occasional low-def texture). But these minor issues are not worth refunding such an amazing game. There are fixes for problems and patches in the future. All in all, this game is great. Worth the 4 year wait (I consider Origins an unnecesary part of the series even though I enjoyed it). Make sure to check your system before purchasing, though.

This ,however, is based on my personal experience during 20 hours of gameplay.  Pros : -It's BEAUTIFUL &amp; runs VERY well (I honestly haven't witnessed a single hiccup or framerate drop) -Great improvements to overall gameplay mechanics -A new and very detailed environment -Combat mechanics have been vastly improved -Great uses of GameWorks and Physx features -Great storyline so far -Some things that may be construed as spoilers.... -I'm loving it so much that my first session lasted about 20 hours and felt like 3 or 4 hours at most.   Cons : -Batmobile controls were a little hard to get used to. -It's currently capped at 30 FPS (more of my opinion on this below) -It stops responding after it closes and I have to click 'Wait' or 'Close' in a Windows dialogue. There's no delay or anything.....just an extra mouse-click.    I occasionally feel sorry for developers now-a-days.....and this is definitely one of those cases.  This game is awesome and well worth the money, wait and anticipation, if you don't start ****ing with settings because you can't live without 60+ FPS. I'm sure it's capped at 30 FPS for a reason and is most likely temporary.  With all of the settings increased to their current maximum, this game is beautiful and runs VERY well.....as long as I don't change the FPS cap. Honestly......this game @ 30 FPS does not bother me AT ALL. The small amount of motion blur it applies totally smooths out the frame rate.  I'm not sure if it actually does not like some hardware configurations or if all of the negative reviews are from people who insist on changing the framerate cap or do not have the hardware to run it. Guess what happens when I change the FPS cap.....it runs like ****.  My specs (all stock settings): Intel i7-4820K 3.7GHz 32GB G.Skill Ripjaws DDR3 EVGA X79 Classified Board (1) EVGA GTX 770 Classified 4GB (4) WD Black RE4 500 GB HDDS's  **** Updated Statements *****  I pre-ordered the Deluxe version (game +season pass). I enjoyed the game for 40+ hours (It ran fine for me with max settings @ 30 fps). BUT.....the instability (or the inability to play at all) that the vast majority of people have experienced, combined with the delay of PC DLC and over 2 month wait for a remotely decent patch leaves me tempted to not buy another Rocksteady or WB game for the next 5+ years (hoping they get their **** together and learn not to rush a release....if it's not ready, delay that **** and get it right) unless it's on sale and proven to be stable. It's inexcusable to release a game in that state.  For their sake, I hope they have something planned to make up for this massive blunder (although I highly doubt it). It'd probably be the one and only thing that would make me even consider buying another one of their games for full-price (much less pre-order) ever again...... and I didn't have any problems playing it at release, I just have the utmost sympathy for all of the people who eagerly anticipated this game only to be screwed upon release and left hanging for over 2 months for a decent patch.",

Honestly, WB probably underestimated the tax this game puts on CPU usage but your dads laptop isn't meant for this, it was meant for him to watch porn while your mum was ♥♥♥♥ing the milkman... I feel like we are wondering off topic....  Is that game good? Yes, Yes it is, I heartily recommend it IF you can run Farcry 4, Dying light etc on ultra with good fps.  Whats the gameplay like? Its Batman....it's a dating sim where you get Miss Fist and Mr Shattered Mandible together  Does it have replay value? ehhhh.... not really? I mean, If you're going for full completetion its a 100+ hour game, but it has got DLC (ew, right?), Challenge modes, Leader boards and alike.  Rating? *Vibrates lips making that horse sound when people are obnoxiously and audibly trying to decide on something* 8.5? Combat is fluid and fun, challenging but not frustrating, the Batmobile is more fun than you could have with two asian pornstars and suitcase full of blow, story is good if not for the obvious twist and few plot holes (no spoilers) and if nothing else it gives you a nice walking tour of Gotham, with key characters and places from DC universe showing up... also some not so key characters. alas still no Mr Freeze :|  Please leave all butthurt comments about FPS issues below :)   P.S. I will give my butterfly fade to whoever finds the person the voiced the riddler in this game, brings them to my house bound and gagged and then returns 48 hours later with a wet/dry vac to get rid of the evidence.",

I have not have a single issue that has plagued the pc version of this game. If you're a fan of the Arkham series this game is amazing.   The Good:  This is a grittier Batman, plagued by the events of Arkham City. Imagine this as closure to the 90s Animated Series.  Combat flows much better than in any other game of the series.   The story is the best the series has had. There are a few side missions that felt unrelated to the overall story, but they are few and far between. Most of the missions in the game feel like they are all important to the overall story.  The Bad:  Frame rate is locked at 30fps without tweaking an ini file. (This is the only issue that is commonly complained about that I experienced)  Difficulty, since combat flows much better and Batman has upgraded his tech the game can feel too easy at times.  For reference here is the specs of my machine, of course milage may vary as the current cause of the problems are unknown. i7 2600k 16GB ram GTX 970 running the game at 1080p max settings all Nvidia fx features on.

There's no copy&amp;paste effort, but rather the city is one massive, collective work of art. It speaks to an incredible attention to detail and care that went into those aspects of the game.

The Super Heros: The game feels good when you get that last hit pow sound. Game play is familiar to the other 3 batmans from WB. Batmobile, cool concept but it just doesn't compete with Batman dishing out a beatdown. Shoot some drones or smash some skulls? That final 'Pow' sound when you knocked someones block off, just makes saving Gotham more addictive. Alot of the environment breaks apart and crumbles which is graphically cool. You get a bit more of immersion when your smashing up Gotham with the Bat/tank. I rate the game 4 out of 5, game play, story, and graphics.   The Sinister Villans: Demanding on the GPU Vram. If you want to game 1080p 3GB Vram, 1440p 4GBVram GTX 970 1080P max settings + Gameworks it runs great. Stutters on 1440p. R9 290 Max settings 1440p, runs like butter. Gameworks is nice, but just a gimic for a loss of 10-30fps and stable frame rates the game will stutter like a disability. I leave the dirt and smoke effects off, too much tessellation to gimp AMD cards, well to gimp the entire performance of the game. I tried to manually SLI my 970s and it doesnt work for me as of Dec. 09 2015. Tried to force my second 970 as the Physx card still about the same FPS. I felt forced into having to drive or tank.

In graphics options, disable all the  'Nvidia Gameworks'  options. There seem to be the major cause of the slowdowns.      Game only runs at 30 FPS:  Open  &lt;Steam folder&gt;\\steamapps\\common\\Batman Arkham Knight\\BMGame\\Config\\BMSystemSettings.ini . Find the line that says  MaxFPS=30.000000  and change it to  MaxFPS=60.000000       Mouse sensitivity is too high:  Open  &lt;Steam folder&gt;\\steamapps\\common\\Batman Arkham Knight\\BMGame\\Config\\BMInput.ini . Find the line that says  MouseSensitivity=30.0  and lower the value until it feels comfortable  (You need to restart after each change)     MY REVIEW:   I'll write a full review when I'm finished, but for now, I'll just say that once you get through all the manual setup, this game is  fantastic . I  do  agree that for a $60-100 game, the need for all these fixes and workarounds is upsetting  (don't companies QA their games anymore?) , but this game is so good now that I can actually play, I'm willing to look past that.",

It is a Great Game Dont be Negative,Please Wait until the Problems are Fixed and the Game is updated.   i dont want to spoil the End of the Game,but it is indeed a Great Ending Worth playing For.  May you Have a Great Day and Thanks for Reading this Review ",

            "review_text": "OK, So I've just completed the Scarecrow mission (is that the main mission by the way?) What I've noticed since day 1 - obviously the initial release was pretty poor (but playable for me all be it at 30/60 fps) - I started the game and probably played a good few hours, but decided to wait for the first patch for the improved and much needed performance. (so my experience wouldnt be ruined) I then played on the September patch, and things were massivly improved, the extra in game effects and 90fps are far superior - I played a bit more, but still I thought I'd wait for the October patch (I was busy with other things anyway). October patch and at first it seemed like a downgrade - I play on some serious hardware i7 4770K @4.4Ghz, MSI 980Ti Gaming @ ~1400Mhz with 32Gb of system RAM! Also I have a G-Sync monitor @1440p (ASUS ROG P278Q). I had the latest Hotfix drivers initially 358.59 and the game was running awful. So I downgraded to 358.50 and things were still bad - however, turning off G-Sync made things much better (358.59 were supposed to fix some G-Sync framrate issues) Finally I went back to 358.59 after removing the drivers properly with DDU and things seemed much improved with G-Sync ON. What I do notice is, that for no apparent reason the framerate occasionally drops from ~80fps (with everything on max including gameworks) to 40fps, but also the GPU usage falls to 50%, this seems to happen when nothing much is going on and can be in a scene with low complexity - odd.) Other than that, the framerate has been very good and the game has played mainly smoothly - I should hope so too with this hardware. (I can't remeber the September patch having this problem) On that note I have very much enjoyed the Scarecrow campain, of note has been a very interesting story line and some absolutly awesome vocal acting, especially from the Joker - well written lines from all characters. The character detail is also superb, with all the main villains being superbly rendered and animated. Some great cutscenes too and very decent gameplay. So all in all things are on the up, I would love to see the GPU usage bug squashed ASAP, I think I will pause my gameplay again until this patch is released. Although still not perfect I would say great work so far considering the mess it was in on initial release, and please continue PC support even if the PC crowd is a bit fickle and hard to please (quite rightly so!) A great game that I would highly recommend - especially when all the bugs are fixed - please hurry! P.S. How do you get the consolation software that we are supposed to get for free? It's not in my library and is full price in the store. Cheers, Jon.",

All Gamesworks options are set to Off.  So far the game has been fantastic and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend buying it. For me it's been the best game in the Rocksteady Batman series.

After unlocking the framerate via the game files, I'm running everything at max settings at 60+ frames.  Now for the actual review of the game and not the performance:  An 'M' rated Batman game means a lot more room a dark and gritty story (as is made evident at the very start of the main story). This game has a lot of that. I'd have to say my favorite part is that you actually feel very powerful from the beginning. Unlike previous games where it wasn't until you unlocked a few Predator and combat abilities that you really felt like you had variety and power, this game provides a ton of options right from the start.  I actually thought early on in the game, 'Wow, this feels like the ending of previous games in the series!' That's how well this game was designed. I really FEEL like Batman right from the start; not a guy who looks like him but needs upgrades to truly reach my potential.  Anyway, when the game is fixed for the majority I HIGHLY suggest playing it if you're a fan of the series.",

If you can run it well then it's a great game, but that is the problem I suppose.

It ran perfectly during my marathon gaming session with it, and it looks beautiful. As for the game itself, Rocksteady has delivered another fantastic game, the gameplay mechanics are tight and enjoyable, and it all fits in perfectly to the Arkham Universe.   The only negatives I have with the game are story related. It didn't feel as big as Arkham City in terms of side quests, and I found the limited amount of time you get to play with a side kick a rather missed opportunity. There are a few other main story issues I had as well, primarily in the later parts of the game, but all of those enter the spoilers realm.   So to sum it all up: it ran perfectly on my PC, they perfected the gameplay elements from the previous games in the series, but they made some questionable story choices that made it not quite live up to the finale I wanted. If you are a Batman / Comic book fan, this is a must get game (play the others first though), and for gamers I would still recommend it as it has some great gameplay mechanics.",

What can I say it's a RockSteady Batman game, it's made me laugh, feel sad, got in a few good jump scares, great story telling.  My one worry was that the Batmobile would suck or be overused, it doesn't and it isn't. The car is used as a puzzle solving tool sometimes but most of the game could be completed without ever feeling like you have to use the Batmobile.  If you like the Rocksteady Batman games, then you know what you're getting into and will get the experience you expect.

It kind of sucks that a lot of PC players are experiencing problems but realize this, most of them haven't figured out how to uncap the 30 fps lock (which IGN posted a how to on it) ALSO... many of these people experiencing problems are probably playing the game in 1080p which i found oddly to be performing worse than if you were to play it in 4k. I know this because i have played in both resolutions and I can tell you right now that it strangely performs better when played in 4k resolution. I ran benchmarks on both resolutions and strangely found that I get better performance and avg fps in 4k than in 1080p. So to those experiencing problems, you might want to be patient until they patch the problems and once they do, you'll realize what a fantastic game Rocksteady has made. It doesn't deserve the bad reviews it's getting because of some performance problems that can be fixed. until then, be patient until they sort it out and then give it another chance before you condemn it to hell and allow it a more fair review because for the few of us that can actually play the game, it truly is a marvel to play and to look at. so far the story really has me hooked. the voice talent is incredible too. John Noble is giving a spine chilling performance as scarecrow and kevin conroy is once again doing a fantastric job voicing batman and johnathan banks from breaking bad and better call saul is doing a phenomenal job as gordon.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: In the interests of full disclosure I must admit that I am the Batman and thus my opinion may be prone to bias in regards to this work.  Thoroughly enjoyable game, combat is a little bit more varied with new attack and enemy types but otherwise the same as previous games. The batmobile is a fun addition and they certainly lived up to their claim that gotham city was built around using it, seriously you NEED to use it everywhere. Batman is so reliant on it it's amazing he ever survived arkham city and asylum without it. The plot is enjoyable, more dark and insular than previous games which gives it a greater hold on the player as it unfolds.  Performance wise people have a lot of complaints, there's the 30fps cap which CAN be modified using the ini but honestly it should be available in the options.  I've heard people talk about big fps drops but after having played about 20 hours I've only experienced it once or twice and I'm usually pretty good at noticing drops, still it's affecting others so it's something to consider.  I play it on my gtx 970 with gameworks features turned off and everything else on max.... which isn't a lot honestly (not a lot of graphics options available) and the game looks pretty damn good.  Honestly I really like this game and I feel that other people should know that this IS a good game mechanic and design wise, but that it MAY have technical issues. I haven't experienced any but the storm of negative reviews certainly suggests it has some, it's worth noting that not everyone is experiencing them though.",

If you can do great showing it on E3 and tested something on DEMO or BETA why do you not test your finished product and don't see what is wrong while the whole community can, who were not the ones who developed the game. This is what I dont get with new games nowadays technology is advanced but you can't test a finished product properly.knowing you guys even delayed the game, and now this..? why would people even buy expendsive graphic cards then buy your game if you would lock to 30FPS . we would rather buy a GTX660 and leave 9XXGTX or TITAN if it was all but lock to 30.. such a dissapointment the community. as the GAME LINE SAYS.THIS IS HOW BATMAN DIED.

I was worried I wouldn't be able to play it when I got home because many of the people reporting problems had more expensive graphics cards than I do, and mine is an AMD which I was led to believe would spell D-O-O-M for my prospects of playing Arkham Knight.  However, I found that all the fuss was about nothing. Yes it is locked at 30 fps by default, but that was an easy fix. I simply installed the most recent AMD drivers before initializing the game, then changed the 'Max_FPS' value to 60 in the BMSystemSettings.ini file and it ran perfectly. I played for 6 hours straight and didn't see so much as a hiccup. So here I am telling you that this game is awesome! People have also been complaining about drops in framerate and the addition of the Batmobile, which I think it's a really clever addition, especially how it is frequently used to solve puzzles.  Overall, there is a LOT to do in this game. I'm only 24% through the main story, which is very captivating (no spoilers, but a few of the scenes I've witnessed show how this title earned its 'M' rating from ESRB. This is my first time writing my Steam review, but I wanted to give this title some praise, as I think everyone has really overreacted to the initial problems. Let me be clear, in my experience, the game is by no means 'unplayable,' and I expect to continue playing it through completion on PC.   Oh, and one more awesome touch I noticed. This is the first PC game that has actually read my PS4 controller as such and makes use of the light bar and vibration features, which was an awesome change (normally I have to run a program that causes my PC to read my Dualshock 4 as an Xbox 360 controller, which can cause confusion when you have to press X.

Next, the story: I did not get very far in the story yet, however the addition of Rocksteady's own supervillain, the 'Arkham Knight', certainly makes it interesting, as one will certainly start to develop theories on who the Arkham Knight is. Now to the point that everyone criticizes: Graphics and performance: I play the game on high settings, I play with a GTX 970 and a Phenom II X4 965. Everything works fine, I still have to test, wether I can surpass the fps-lock, if I turn it off.

Based on the overwhelmingly negative response out there it seems I've been very lucky. So obviously approach the game with caution.   Moving past that, after about four hours with the game my feelings are mostly positive:  Being The Batman feels even more like being The Batman than before. The new takedown moves that are quickly unlocked - cool multiple stealth takedowns and the seamless, flowing environment takedown - are brilliant additions. This is smile inducing stuff in an already solid as hell combat engine that has always been the core of this game's appeal.  Arkham Knight is a rarity for me in being the right kind of big-budget spectacle. Modern premium releases often make me think about the insanity of games development but it is rare that that reflection is positive. They can often feel like hollow and stale experiences, especially when they are serialised, and make me crave indie game excitement and creativity. Somehow Arkham Knight doesn't.   I can deeply appreciate the polish everything has been given. A costume change is given the amount of cinematic clout many games would struggle to bring to a heavily directed fight cut-scene. The effortless way it flips to a closeup accentuating the Batmobile's pimped out Batman symbol rims, glowing red hot, after a successful leap across a bridge gap. It's overblown and extreme and the man-hours invested is insane. But it's the right kind of overblown and it is utterly fitting to what is, at its core, still a fine game. A delicious decorative icing on a Batman cake that already has the most organicly rich and flavour packed combat and city-soaring in the ingredient list.  It's the kind of game that I can't help but imagine taking back in time to explode the minds of early video game developers!  Because of its robust core systems and great world design there aren't just moments of cool the game directs you down. The potential to be cinematic without ever leaving the safety of gameplay remains from the previous titles and with the stunning graphics it is heightened.   While pinging through the air near the start of the game, getting to grips with how to fly again, I ended up off-course and suddenly perched on top of a bit of scenery surveying the city. I paused, stopped trying to play and just took in what was on screen. Crouched on a huge, overgrowth covered gothic statue with an insane, twisted, crazy vision of Gotham lit up before me... Hugely cinematic and totally unscripted - the kind of jaw dropping that only this sort of size and spectacle can create.  It's not really about the views though, it's about connecting kevlar covered fist to thug face and combat feels as brilliant as ever. I don't know if something this flowing, tight and intuitive can ever feel tired and the ways in which you can pinball between enemies is now even wider. A new Streets of Rage Game using this system would be welcome (I wish for this with each new Batman game. I guess I feel Skate and Blaze are somehow better than Batman). ;)  So this is all good stuff. But that Batmobile...   Don't get me wrong, it is uber cool in a lot of ways. It looks amazing and when it is an option to quickly get around it is a fun extra in the 'I'm The Batman' arsenal. It won't get used often but every so often the urge to launch like a scud missile from it kicks in.  However, when something in a game this big-budget has this much time put into it to make it look cool as cool can be you can be damned sure the developer is going to rinse all that they can from it.  I don't want to play a tank game.   I certainly don't want to be back-and-forthing in greater than usual amounts to complete simple progression because of the new tank option.   The Batmobile has its tricks and they are fun the first time... except you know as they happen that you will have to do them over and over as you continue and they will never be as fun as gliding and swooping and punching people while being Batman.   So to summarise, it is good being Batman again but it would be better if there were less things stopping Batman effortlessly gliding to the next bit of brawling. That's much the same in every one of the games in this series and possibly why the first is always going to be the stand-out. It is a tighter and more intense experience despite (or because of) the lack of city swooping (and now Bat-tank grinding) freedom.   Arkham Kinight is huge and impressive and good. It just needs to be more focused and move forward without making the player move backwards three times for each step ahead.",

Sidequests are back, some were really cool, some were more of a grindfest (Riddler once again).  Now about the gameplay.  As usual, the gameplay is smooth, satisfying and comes with a few new twists. An advanced skill tree allows you to focus on the moves you use the most while expanding your moveset. The one complaint I have about the gameplay is how you will be using the batmobile a bit too much. (It handles fine though, you have to get used it to it).

The one thing i will say is that the fps is locked at 30fps which isnt really a reason to moan you can still have fun but there is a fix you can just go to (BmSystemSettings.ini file located in Batman Arkham Knight/BmGame/Config/, changing Max_FPS=30 to Max_FPS=9999). This improve's it but the FPS isnt contantly at 60 it still drop's to 40 or 50.  But i recommend leaving it locked because there's probably a reason for that.   But considing the game was port fowarded to the pc by a 3rd party company i think that Rocksteady Game's are doing a good job in addressing the issue's straight away.  All in all I think that it is a great game and defintly worth buying if you havent already but if you havent maybe wait a week or 2 for them to iron out the fps issue's if it really bother's you that much.

The game plays like its predecessors and improves on a variety of things. One notable addition is the Batmobile. Personally, I don't like being forced to use the Batmobile so much but it's fine since the Batmobile is so fluid, and smooth. The controls are intuitive, and the car itself is a beast. Really feels like you're driving THE Batman's car. The game itself is great, fantastic very deserving of its 91 metacritic score on the console side.  However, the performance as of the release date is a bit spotty. My computer runs it fine, i5-4690k, gtx 770 2gb, 8gb ram. It could put all the settings on max (note though textures missing high/ultra option, so are some of the other options). With all settings put to highest, I averaged around 50 fps (with the .ini max fps cap set to 60) in everything EXCEPT the Batmobile. As soon as I entered the batmobile, my fps dropped to around 1 - 15fps.  After setting all the settings to lowest, the game plays very smoothly with 60 fps, and Batmobile has improved vastly albeit still a little sluggish at times. Despite the settings on low, the game is GORGEOUS.   So bottom line, the game is great, and very playable for me (no crashes, minor stutter) with 1080p and 60 fps. Hopefully Rocksteady releases a patch soon that fixes some of this lag, and performance so that I can at least run it at normal settings. My computer should be able to. In the meantime, while not ideal, playing on lowest settings still results in a very well-made, beautiful, and fun game.",

UPDATE: Did the NVIDIA driver update as suggested and seems to have fixed most of the issues I'm experiencing. I am noticing slight stuttering in the frame rate but it doesn't detract much from the gameplay. Loving it so far!  UPDATE #2: Was only noticing the frame rate problems when using the Batmobile or gliding in the open world, which is most of the game and a big requirement if you want to get around in the world. But even when Batman was on the ground walking and in some fighting animations, the frame rate would slow to a crawl, even less than 30fps. Uninstalling the game for now until the patch is delivered.   Sad :-(",

            "review_text": "So I've read a LOT of complaints about this game and how horrible the experience is for most of the players. Here is an overview of my experience so far (only played roughly 6 hrs so far):  My setup: Intel i5 4690K (Codename: Devils Canyon) 3.50GHz Processor  ASUS Gryphon Z97 Motherboard  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 GPU  16GB of RAM  Installed on a 1TB HDD (Western DIgital)  Settings (in-game): 1920x1080, AA On, VSYNC On, Textures: Normal, Other settings are High as well (don't remember what they were). NVIDIA GameWorks: OFF except for Enhanced Rain. Also set my PhysX-&gt;GPU in the NVIDIA Control Panel.  Performance: So far, for me at least, the performance is going well. Definitely more than playable. I didn't edit any ini files, and I don't have the latest drivers installed (I have 353.06). I also deleted the pre-load data before the game unlocked because of all the nightmare re-downloading crap people have gone through. Installed the game from scratch when it unlocked (9:00pm PST) instead. Obviously the 30fps cap is crap considering its a PC game, but I'm not touching the ini files just to be safe. I'll live with 30fps for now, doesn't really bother me all that much to be honest.  Running around as Batman: Smooth fps for me, occasional hiccup when auto-saving though.  Driving the Batmobile: Yep, there are framerate dips from time to time, but for me its not NEARLY as bad as people make it sound. I expected the fps drops considering moving around in the Batmobile is more demanding then running around as Batman for the computer. Overall though, it's a fun and enjoyable experience.  Gliding: More fps drops then running around as Batman, but not as much as the Batmobile and its very quick, not blatantly obvious.  Graphics: This game is great looking to me, although not as gorgeous as I expected considering the hardware requirements and no ULTRA settings (unless that is what Normal is supposed to be). Haven't encountered the bright light textures that some encounter where all the character are emitting a bright light. No weird bugs, minus the normal clipping issues and Batman going through the Batmobile when I summon it. Overall very nice to look at.  Gameplay: Obviously just as good as the other Batman games. Great combat, storyline (so far), playability and lots of sidequest to do. Some people hate the Batmobile gameplay but I enjoy it. I try to balance between playing as Batman and driving the Batmobile because it seems they REALLY want you to use the Batmobile (maybe too much even, but meh, it is what it is). Also, some have experienced issues with their Xbox/PS4 controllers not working, but my Wired Xbox 360 controller works fine.  Overall, I'm really enjoying the experience so far regardless of the minor fps drops here and there, which I can live with. It does need a patch though, I will agree with that and changing the Pre-order Harley bonus for users who got the game with a GPU purchase (me) so that we don't get it is complete bull but I can live without it, considering it will be available later on and I've heard its not very long anyway. Hopefull they will rectify this over the next few weeks along with a patch. Also don't really like the fact that the PC version was ported via an outside company but I know this seems to be standard practice for companies nowadays.  I wish there was a middle of the road option when rating this review instead of just thumbs up or down. I'm inclined to give it a thumbs up because my own personal experience with the game so far has been very satisfactory.   Remember: This is my OWN personal experience and yours may differ from mine (more than likely). I would not have played through 5 hrs. of the game in one sitting unless the game was playing well. Hope this provides some insight and hope for people.   ",

Unlocks require more than 1 point in some cases, seems to be alot more upgrade options... and yes it's silly that their no death when running the batmobile.... seriously.

It's a huge game, with beautiful graphics and a LOT of stuff going on all at once. Of course the console version will run smoother as the graphics are tuned down immensely. I know, I have a PS4 sitting right next to my PC with a few games on both systems.  All I can say is turn off Anti-Aliasing, keep V-sync on and check if your GPU has 3GB of VRAM or above, as this game specifally specifies 3GB of VRAM is needed.  All in all, amazing yet again. Each iteration of the Arkham games just gets better and better. I've played a bit of it so far and I'm amazed by it.

Downgrading to the previous driver from nvidia fixed this. I don't know if this is it but all I know is I havent updated my nvidia driver and it works perfectly fine with settings like mine.

The only thing that is a bit annoying are the intro ads for companies that can't be skipped and a really long launch that made me think the game actually crashed (but that's probably because I have my games on slow HDD).  For now, I can't complain but will probably do an update when I get deeper into the game as 30 minutes is enough for testing the performance but not the rest of the game.",

I have a GTX 970 and it ran at an average of 58fps. I honestly don't understand what problem you guys have had. All I can presume is you didn't install the driver nvidia released for the game, or you simply presumed you could run this higher-end game on your potatoes. I should point out that I wasn't capped at 30fps by default, so I have no idea how others were.  ANYWAY, this game is a fantastic installment to the franchise and IMO the best. I 100% completed AA and AC, I intented to do the same for AK. It's a shame that all the negativity you lot are giving it, make it look like it is a bad game, when I promise that it isn't.

I let the game do whatever the heck it wanted and didn't touch the options at all. I later found out it was running at 1280x720 in pretty much low everything.   But wow! Aside from being a bit low res because of the ... low res, the first scene was amazing! So immersive, so many objects and textures, stuff going on outside the windows, so many people all different, I really felt in the game.  Cut scenes were running at 60 fps and gameplay at a pretty steady 30 fpsish. Vsync was off I think and there was some slight tearing sometimes. I didn't notice any frame rate drops or stuttering or pausing at all.  I'll try turning the settings up gently later but I could easily live with the graphics the way they are now for the story.  One thing though, the default controls for keyboard and mouse wreck your hand a bit: in the batmobile you have to be moving the mouse around while holding down the right button and clicking the middle button occasionally- it's a bit much.",

So, a D- for quality of released code, but a solid A for 'is this a fun game'.  I recommend it. If you don't like tweaking game settings in .ini files, wait for the inevitable patches etc to be released then buy.  I could usually give two craps about pre-release vs post-release purchases etc, but this incident really makes me think its OK to purchase games once they're 50% off on Steam sales exclusively.  Currently the only issues I'm seeing are some stupid Rage-esque pop-in textures. No issues supporting a 34-inch display even, can't argue that.",

Let' s hope that the Game keeps it' s consistancy, and does not fall short of my expectation's!  For the now, the Main Pro's are as follows:  The Graphics are incredibly optimised.  The City is extremely vast.  The Batmobile is not a hindrance.  The Characters are extremely well thought out.

Everything is running on high with Gameworks on and I've excperienced no stuttering, glitches or bugs. HOWEVER, this game is locked at 30fps, and if you try to unlock it through the .ini file, then there's a big chance you'll crash the game. This has to change.  The story is also good, but don't expect anything new. And no, the Arkham Knight is not a new character, like Rocksteady claimed.

Now, straight off the bat of this review, this game DOES NOT deserve to be rated Mostly Negative. Literally a few weeks ago, Fallout 4's trailer was released and everyone was saying 'It's not all about the graphics and performance, it's about the story', then they buy this game, come across a 30FPS capped game (Which can be easily changed to 60 in the config file) and rate it down.  Anyway, the actual review. You take up the role of Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, who has the task of taking down Scarecrow and a whole army of drones, super-villans andyour general brutes. I have played and completed all Batam games created by Rocksteady Studios and I thought this game would end up like Assassins Creed, but this conclusion to the series blows the series out of the water. The story is amazing and so detailed. You'll have around 15-20 hours playing the main story mode and most likely another 15-30 hours finishing the other missions and collecting all the riddler trophies. With the new batsuit, batmobile, smooth fluid combat and a beautiful looking world, Arkham Knight is the best Batman Game of all time.   -| Minor Spoiler Part |- From all the predecessors of the Arkham series, Joker has always been the main bad guy, but in Arkham Knight, Joker is inside Batman's head the entire time of the game, just randomly popping up with dialogue and with his hopes of achieving his end goal to take over Bruce's body and mind. The Joker made this game go from great to perfect for me, because Joker is always there and because he's such a loveable character, it's great to constantly have him round.  -| Combat |- It's a Batman game, ofc the combat is going to be superb, but now with the batmobile, combat just takes this leap into utter greatness. The controls are a bit eh to get used to, but before you know it, you'll be drifting round corners and running over thugs.  -| Pros |-    Beautiful Looking Game    Combat is Fluid    Amazing Storyline    Joker Ofc    Doesn't Feel Boring to Play    Gliding Around    New Upgrades for Batman    No Bugs (That I Came Across)    Jonathan Banks as Commissioner Gordon   -| Cons |-    Frames Are Up &amp; Down (45-60FPS for me)    Batmobile Controls Could be Better    Performance is Alright, But Could Be Better   -| Final Score |- Batman: Arkham Knight is the perfect end to the Arkham series. Rocksteady ended it very well and I respect that they didn't drag this series out, like how Assassins Creed is being milked like a cow.   4.5/5 - Perfect &amp; Flawless Storytelling, Arkham Knight Won't Disappoint.   -| My Specs |- CPU: Intel Core i7 4790 RAM: 2x8GB GPU: AMD Radeon R9 270 HDD: 3TB Seagate  Ran between 45-60FPS constantly",

            "review_text": "Note: at no point in my completion of Arkham Knight on PC did I encounter any serious glitches or bugs, so I can't offer a review of the PC port's performance beyond saying it ran perfectly for me. Moving on...  As I played through the final moments of this series, I thought of one game I almost never do: it's predecessor, Arkham Origins. As competent and perfectly playable as that game was, it highlights a striking contrast with Arkham Knight: one of vision. Origins created a conservative, almost tepid version of the world's greatest detective, checking off all the obligatory boxes but never fully embracing the character's legacy. Knight, on the other hand, is brave, bold, the work of a developer clearly confident in their abilities. In Asylum and City, you felt like Batman. For the first time, in Arkham Knight, you truly become him.  This is not a statement to be made lightly. The game earns that praise through a number of smart decisions, starting with the Batmobile. Vehicle sections in otherwise action-oriented games tend to end up... off. Had the experience of driving the hero's iconic car consisted of finicky controls or lackluster power, it would have certainly damaged the game as whole. However, Rocksteady has nailed it in every concievable way; driving through the city is at once comfortable and breathtaking. The vehicle controls in a responsive way, and it's battle functionality enables both more precise movement and satisfying firepower. After mastering the basics, Rocksteady goes further: At any location in Gotham, a single button press summons the Batmobile in under 5 seconds. Moving the aiming reticule from a machine to a person automatically switches from explosive to incapacitating ammunition. The trunk stores not spare tires, but a fully protective roll cage for Batman's passengers. Colliding with a tree results not in sudden stop, but a shower of debris as you sail through it. It's details like these elevate that truly elevate the Batmobile beyond traditional transport.  Other reviews have voiced concerns that the driving doesn't 'feel like Batman', that blowing up unarmed drones somehow conflicts with the character's personality. I disagree. Every time you drive by one of Gotham's many goons, they run away, screaming 'The Bat's here!' 'He's got a tank!' This is Batman more than anything: the fantasy that everyone fears you, that nothing can stand in your way. It's empowering, in a word. Fantastically empowering.  The sense of power is further heightened through improvements indicative of a video game sequel. The map is bigger than City's, which means you fly higher and drive faster than before. You get more gadgets, which enables you even more navigational and offensive abilities. Even the menus have been upgraded, cleanly organizing side content in a managable, approachable way. None of this has come at the cost of core features or fun. Content and polish abound in Arkham Knight.  All of this would be for naught if Rocksteady dropped the ball concluding the story of their trilogy. Thankfully, however, they've succeeded at creating a satisfying and involving narrative, one that stands as a great Batman story in it's own right. After having just read how much bigger and grander the game is, I wouldn't blame you for fearing that the plot could run off the rails. However, this is where the game surprises most of all: while the city size and polygon count has risen dramatically, the focus of the story has shrunk and condensed. Past games could feel at times like a Batman wikipedia, cramming as many villains as possible into their storylines. While dedicated comic book fans may get a rush from seeing every character represented onscreen, it reduced their individual impacts in the narrative, creating caricatures instead of meaningful people.  Arkham Knight, on the other hand, reigns back the rogues gallery to the bare essentials. Oh, make no mistake, if you want to go fight Penguin, Two-Face, or Firefly, you can use that mission menu I mentioned earlier to guide you through their terrific, yet optional side stories. The main quest, however, is truly a Batman story, in that it's a story about Batman: a character study, an examination about why Batman does what he does. This would be moot if Arkham Knight was in any way a half-hearted or conventional affair. It's fitting, then, that the story revolves around admitting and facing your fears, because Rocksteady clearly has none in the portrayal of the caped crusader. This game is dark, deliciously dark, unafraid to suprise or frighten you with extended, artsy segments normally reserved for indie games, and it's this boldness that really sells the story's drama. Granted, the occasional plot beat may seem a bit familiar (your first guess at the Arkham Knight's identity won't be correct, but your second might), but, by-and-large, the story is full of interesting twists and memorable moments, and is one you surely won't want spoiled.  Another Batman trilogy capper, The Dark Knight Rises, proves that all the good intention in the world can't redeem base deficits or shaky foundations. Arkham Knight rises above that category of disappointing three-quels, offering compelling combat, gorgeous graphics, and a superb story. There may be no such thing as a perfect game, but Arkham Knight is the perfect Batman game.",

The batmobile handles like a dream, usually I dont need to break at all for corners the powerslide is a bit overboard, only really need that to turn 180 and the aftrerburner pretty much makes turning impossible so save it for straight stretches. The gliding is way better than in last games, you can virtually fly now and again on my systyem I haven't had any significant frame drops diving and gliding all over thje view distance is superb. Combat is smooth and batman is a beast right at the start of the game I started on hard mode and feel like as powerful as halfway through arkham city on Hard when you have the grapple boost and stuff already but thats just where this game begins.

The Bat Mobile is fun, but does handle really poorly, you can drift, but I haven't found it to be that useful. In fact it seemed like just releasing the gas worked better when making sharp turns. I feel like it would be better if Batman was able to take out the tanks without the use of the Batmobile because he's more resourceful than that, maybe later in the game? Combat is fun and being able to use more elements in the envorinment and picking up weapons is cool too, again making Batman feel more like he is in the comics/film/cartoons. Also another thing that I like about the game is that some of the enemies have 'medics' with them so if you don't take the out the one that have been knocked out can be revived.  two things that annoy me are 1.) the map, which needs a little more detail interms of landmarks(I had no idea where West Dixon Dock was). I don't need the game to give me a flashy icon or anything, but a map with a few more locations on it would be nice. and 2.) some of the textures, like Two Face's skin and suit look don't look that great.

What I want to say first, however, is this;  I hadn't, from the beginning of this game to reaching ACE Chemicals, had any frame drops or skips, and I'm running an i7-4790k with a GTX 980, everything maxed. I'd advise touching ANYTHING with the game's ini files, as that does screw with how the port is optimized.  Is it a good port? I think so. Whether you want to beleve the heavy negative reviews or not is your choice. I got my money's worth. If anything to stray from in this game, its the fact that standard batmobile driving and steering is so bad that you're almost holding right click the entire time just to move -- the term I coin Batman: The Tank Batmobile Simulator.  Fighting is definitely much more fluid than Arkham City and Origins. I've had so much fun with it so far, and can see many who like Asylum and Origin's fighting systems to also enjoy this. If I had to nitpick, it's definitely a bit easier to fight, more so on the principle of occasionally right click whilst spamming left click.  The story... Well, so far the story isn't exactly revealed once you get to ACE Chemicals at the least. From what I'm seeing, its good so far. All I can say without spoiling. Now, for the part I love about this game; the mission select; Unlike Arkham Origins and City, you have a mission select that'll help you to track your missions much more fluidly - something desperately needed for the size of Gotham as, to be fair, many spots can be confusing to follow or to just track and find stuff. The mission select helps in regards to doing the 'side-quests' that Gordon gives you or the GCPD gives. This doesn't sound intuitive, as yeah this should've existed in City and Origins, but it definitely helps for the fast pace of driving the Batmobile has.  All-in-all, a good game, but for the love of god don't touch the .ini files for the game; that does screw with how the game works overall, ya know :/. Either that, or my computer is weird enough to not experience issues with this game, as my frames have always been a constant 30, no dips whatsoever.",

            "review_text": "    Review Score    10  10     Batman Arkham Knight is the game we've all been waiting for. This game well consume you into the city of Gotham. From death defying adversaries to mind blowing combat Batman: Arkham Knight is the best game in the trilogy. I will elaborate my review by covering these main elements such as gameplay, graphics, performance, and game mechanics.  The gameplay in this game is absolutely terrific. The first notable thing was that the enviroments are completely destructible to a certain degree. While you may not be able to demolish an entire building you can definitely take huge chucks out of it. I love that the Arkham games have certain themes and this one takes place on Halloween. Combat has been redefined and tweaked to the point where it's feels like you are water flowing through the streets of Gotham because of how fluid it is, also it rans a lot in Gotham. There's a ton of new animations which makes the game look very polished. The Remote Batarang can now be deflected off of surfaces now. The Explosive Gel is more accurate when facing foes and can be fired as a projectile. You can now parry as well as counter. The list goes on with all the new moves implemented. Lastly, there's very minimum loading which makes the player not lose that immersion  Graphics are superb and makes you feel like dancing in the rain. The attention to detail is excellent; I noticed that every part on the Batsuit is very distinct and intricate. Subtle nuances are present in every aspect of the city Gotham. The debris that cover ground gives you that chilling feeling down your spine that you're in the atmosphere of chaos. The Physx introduces to this game even more spectacular effects. Phsyx incorporates extra debris, dynamic smoke/fog, water effects, and realistic cloth movement. Although Physx is very demanding the aesthetics really gives it a more realistic feel. The water look fantastic if you ever go by the Gotham Bridge.  Performance is an area where this game seemed to be the most negative. I did have performance issues when I preloaded the game. I was crashing at a specific point and received an error message saying that I was missing files. After verifying the integrity of cache I notice a significant improvement in peformance. Before I was getting around 30 to 20 frames maxed on an Nvidia GTX 970 EVGA SSC edition and Intel 4970k. After verifying the integrity my performance sky rocketed to 60 and 40 frames in heavy combat against drone tanks. I believe that most people who preloaded the game files got corrupted and Steam didn't decyrpt files correctly while installing. I can say my game now runs fine but could use some patches for stability.  Lastly, the game mechanics are phenomenal. I love the fact they allow you to drive the Batmobile. The Batmobile is a similar to having a worthy companion who doesn't say nothing and follows your every command. The way the Batmobile maneuvers is flawless. For those who complain that it's forced upon the player you must not be a Batman true fan; reason being Batman is nothing without his Batmobile. Some things are just impossible for Batman to do and the puzzles you have to solve with the Batmobile is great. The game user interface is elegant and modern. The sleek design makes Batman new iconic suit feels futuristic. The visuals elements for the suit A.I., artificial intelligence, is lovely. As someone who uses After Effects this really does take the pie for stunning visuals that and it give it a very modern look.  I conclude this review by saying the game looks great. The gameplay is marvelous, no pun intended. The graphics are eye popping. Batman: Arkahm Knight is full of content. The performance is optimal after verifying cache. Lastly, the game mechanics are revolutionary and adds tons of depth on top of previous titles. Have a good day and an Arkham Knight.",

The issues I have with the game are related to i.e. the locking the frames per second down to 30, which was weird choice from Rocksteady, but easily bypassed for those who know how to do it. Also, the motion blur is really, really annoying and one of the main 'features' I always remove from any game I play if possible. Locking away the higher resolution textures in the game's own options menu was also an odd choice (I believe this may have something to do with the fact that while the recommended size allocation for the game is 45 gigabytes, the game itself takes only 39 gigabytes of space, so they might actually be missing). The game has also a tendency to crash at very random points, without any obvious reason.  But the game works - I get to play it. Although not at optimal settings, but it works. This is rare for AAA-games these days on the day they are released. Considering how visually impressive this game is and how many new things they've tried to implement into it, I'm rather surprised it all works as well as it does. Anyone who has developed games for PC, or knows someone who has/is in game development, knows that a game of this scale is nigh impossible to get out without running into problems once it's released. I will wait for about a week and see what Rocksteady says and does before I give my final verdict to this game, but so far I've been having fun playing it.  So yeah, I'd recommend this to my friends and anyone who is a fan of the previous games, though perhaps not at its current price tag of 49,99€. Still, for those who can't wait for the discount sales, I say 'Go for it!'  I'll come back and change my review should things not change or turn for the worse.",

There are also people who are compaining about fps issues but so far I didn't get any. I just took off Vsync and was running more than 60. I didn't edit anything in the ini file. Honestly if you are a batman fan I would get this game. It has good graphics and since this was released today there should be patches for the game. This isn't surprising anymore since every game has been like that. I like the game so far.  Update: 6/23.  Other than the horrible fps I get from driving the batmobile since the game renders the city, everything is great. As I said since it is day 1 for this game there will be patches. Other than the batmobile and getting out of it and doing all the cool stuff with the Batmobile everything is like 60+ fps but it does drop at 45-50 at some ocassions",

Currently the game is installed on a regular harddrive, but I will move it to an SSD later.  The game itself, so far, is filled with cinematic sequences and absolutely gorgeous art. The city is a beauty and quite breathtaking to race through in the batmobile or traverse with the grappling hook. The character models are wonderful too. The action combat is very well handled. It's so fast I barely have time to pay attention to the on screen button hints - I'll have to look that up outside of combat.  I thought the game was going to suck based on all the negative comments, but it's truly great! At least on my system. I will update this review later if anything changes.",

Now I'm playing after the patch, I never got a chance to deal with the horribleness of pre-patch. What I'm talking about is the actual gameplay itself. I've never seen a game that tries so hard to ruin itself, it's astonishing really. I feel like there were one or two guys on the design team who were bound and determined to make this experience terrible. What is so frustrating is you keep seeing the game this could have been, but then they disappoint you...again. So here are some very specific examples of what I'm talking about.  •Absolutely nothing is added to the experience of the batmobile being shoehorned into the game. It is only there to annoy you, in extremely aggrivating vehicle segments that never make you feel like Batman. They force you to deal with the batmobile CONSTANTLY, even when doing indoor puzzles! It's utterly ridiculous and whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired.  •The puzzles in this game are not clever, they're just irritating. See the next section as to why.  •This game does something that modern horror movies do that really pisses me off. It establishes a set of rules, and then breaks those rules arbirarily in the name of shock value or an attempt at being 'creative'.  •I won't spoil the story, but if you're any kind of Batman fan, this story is one you've seen before and you that you've seen done better. Honestly I'm pretty insulted as a fan that they thought they could get away with this crappy storyline.  •Most of the villains are portrayed as cartoonish, two-dimensional cardboard cutouts of their comic counterparts. They try hamhandedly to interject depth and fall vastly short  •Game has a great soundtrack, shame we barely ever get to hear it. Too busy listening to the CONSTANT innane chatter of every thug. After a couple hours you've heard it all and it's just irritating.  •The way they wrote Batman in this game is really quite terrible. He makes every single wrong choice he could possibly make, and honestly it doesn't even feel like Batman. This is worth noting just because of how exceptionally terrible it is.  •The most interesting character in the game stops being present before you even hit the halfway mark.  •It wasn't until I got this far into the review that I realize what this game feels like. It's like playing a game version of the 3rd Nolan Batman.  •At least it runs perfectly now after the patch, right?  All in all you're much better off just replaying Arkham Asylum or City. Better yet, pick up a copy of Under the Red Hood, or just read some Batman comics. Rocksteady, you should be ashamed.",

I may try and unlock but for now this is fine.  Full disclosure, I got the game for free with a GPU so I guess I am a little more forgiving than other, but it is day one. Doubtless they will patch it and fix some of the issues, also it may just be that you have to turn down some settings if you don't have a sick rig.  People demand the best graphics, they get all hyped up about graphics and new GPUs but then when the newest game does not run well on a gtx 760, which is a 2 year old card almost, they flip out. If you have a new card, like the 970 or 980, then the game runs well on ultra or max or whatever you want to call it, otherwise, yeah it may need some further optimization.  All in all, I reccomend the game because it is a solid game and I don't belive in basing reviews off the fact that people don't have good enough computers to run a game. Sorry that is just PC gaming, some new games can't be played with old hardware, either deal with the lower settings, don't play the game, or get a better GPU.  I am not even upset that my card can't run it completely smooth when speeding around in an amazing looking batmobile with ♥♥♥♥ exploding everywhere, smoke and rain and debris flying, detructable envoroment wherever I go, sure it hitches up every now and then, but in general it is smooth and boy is it impressive.  So there it is, as close to a glowing review as you will find for this game, I just felt like I should put this here, because the backlash is absurd, like BF4 levels of absurd. A game which, by the way, was massively improved with optimization and is now one of the most efficient games out there.  If you are skeptical, then wait, see if the game gets some attention from devs and/or drivers, but if you can run it, if you have a really nice computer, then yes, I reccomend this game, it is much better than a lot of the crap out there. ♥♥♥♥ ARK is the most popular game on steam right now, and that thing runs like a steaming pile of garbage on most systems too.",

            "review_text": "Just thought I'd write a review discussing the performance for now incase anybody's wondering how well it runs and are on the fence about picking it up. I have played a good bit of the story, but rest assured I will keep this review 100% spoiler free.  I notice there are many negative reviews, but so far my experiences have been positive for the most part, and thus I recommend picking it up.  (Update: a patch was applied that made the game worse and rendered it unplayable. Therefore, I no longer reccommend this game, purely because it runs terribly, although so far I love everything else about it). I intend to update this review as I play for the sake of informing those who are curious as to the quality of the game on PC. I play at 1080p, and my rig contains a GTX970 with a i-5 4670 CPU, and 16 GB of RAM.  First, let me just say I haven't had any overwhelming issues akin to Arkham City's DirectX11 troubles. The game runs surprisingly well and is very playable. It isn't quite as good a port as, for example, Shadow of Mordor, but it is pretty decent.  There aren't many graphics options to choose from. The settings to customise are; texture resolution (low, normal, or high), anti-ailising (literally an 'on' or 'off' option), level of detail (low, normal, or high), and shadow quality (low, normal, or high). Then there are also the additional NVIDIA physix options to play around with; Enhanced Rain, Enhanced Light Shafts, Interactive Paper Debris, and Interactive Smoke and Fog, all of which are 'on' or 'off' options--I keep all of them set to 'off' apart from the 'enhanced rain' option for the sake of a relatively steady frame-rate. When I lock the game to 30 fps, I can keep them all enabled and still get a steady frame-rate, but I prefer to have 60fps.   I haven't encountered much stuttering, many people seem to be complaining about this, but I just haven't encountered any, apart from occasional fps drops to 30. I've also had some issues with screen tearing even with in-game VSync enabled. However, I've found that enabling Adaptive VSync with the NVIDIA Control Panel and disabling it in game got rid of it.   I've began to notice some delayed fade-in with the textures. Normally fade-in doesn't bother me, but it takes quite a while for them to correct, and it has happened in cutscenes as well as gameplay. This is perhaps the worst of the issues I've encountered. I still haven't found a fix for this, but if I do, I will post it. Hopefully the good folks at WB (ha ha) are cooking up a patch right now.  A 350mb patch was released for this game, and it appears to have made it less stable. The fps dropped to an unplayable level. However, setting all of the graphics settings to normal and disabling the additional NVIDIA stuff has made the game run at a very playable 50-60fps, even in the Batmobile.  This port is a train-wreck. However, if you want it to run slightly better, be sure to unlock the game's ridiculous 30fps cap (SteamApps/common/Batman: Arkham Knight/BMGame/Config/BMSystemSettings)  Also, I would have applied for a refund with this, but it came free with my 970, sooo",

I myself am enjoying the game at max settings, there are hiccups here and there when uncapping the 30fps limit but it isn't significant with my setup. If u want to run this game smoothly on a mid-range setup, then try to lower some of the settings and/or don't uncap the 30fps limit (the game still plays very nicely at 30 surprizingly), especially nvidia gameworks settings which are the most demanding, and please, do not consider a GTX 970 a very powerful card when it comes to maxing the game out because 3.5GB is probably not enough for this game at maximum settings at 1080p and higher. Storywise, it simply rocks as far as I've progressed. I totally recommend this game if you don't mind tweaking some settings. If you are the kind who just wants to install and play then you should probably wait a couple of weeks until the big issues are resolved (mostly fps problems).",

The game is badly optimized, but im not gonna talk about that since every other review and discussion talks about it, and you can always fix the frame rate lock. The game is already a big step up from origins, which was okay, but the camera was bad, and disarm and destroy was gotten way too late, which is fixed in this one. I like the batmobile being added in, it is pretty cool, but it controls like balls and some of the challenges require you to make perfect maneuvers in it to 3 star. They moved a lot of the controls on gamepad around to accomodate the batmobile, detective mode is now dpad up and entering the batmobile is left bumper while selecting gadgets is holding down to open a menu, I liked the old system better, but II see why they did this, it just feels more tedious to select equipment.  So the main villain is Scarecrow and this guy called the Arkham Knight who is a pretty cool character, I like him as a character. Joker also makes an appearence, and of course the riddler too. I really like the direction they took the riddler challenges this time. Before yopu had to find all his trophies and stuff before all his missions unlocked, now all you have to do is unlock the ability to bring the batmobile to each area, which is cool because those are some of my favorite missions. I also would like to note that one of the missions, I think it was called creature of the night or something like that, it has the most effective jump scare I have seen in recent history, because I truly was not expecting one in this game.  Batman now also has some new moves, he has a fear gauge which when you do a silent takedown, itll let you access a multitakedown which is pretty neat, it starts at 3 and I believe goes to 5. His grappell boost is also unlocked from the start giving a more fast paced game from the get go. I would say pick this game up w=once all the optimization patches get pushed out. Im running it perfectly fine at a solid 40 fps after unlocking it on a nvidia 650 on low, so keep that in mind if you are wondering if you can run it or not. The graphics will be as bare bones as they can get, but they still look really good.",

Now, I am not saying that the framerate complaints and bad port arguments are incorrect. I however don't seem to have any and that may well be down to my setup, so if that thing puts you off buying then I suggest you read up on that and make your decision elsewhere, as I cannot give any insight on the subject, this review is purely reviewing my experience on the story and other game factors unrelated to compatability with the PC. I am speaking about the characters, the story, the mechanics and the placement involved within this game, this is aimed more so at the players interested in what it's like if you don't have problems with frame rate and other factors restricting your game experience.  I always figured a simple list was better, people are less likely to trudge through words and thus I will try to be as concise as possible.  Cons - I start with these first and break tradition so the Pros are left with you and honestly, I have little to say regarding cons.  - Batmobile prescence at times.   As context, I can see that outside the story the use of the batmobile may become stale and samey for the most part, so far I have only seen a couple of weapons at its arsenal and I expect side missions will be relating mostly to stopping enemy tanks, which will most definitely get dull. - Combat  I am not so sure I can express this con, it's not so much a personal thing, I enjoy the combat. However it is not hard by any means, you can easily dispatch a group of over 10 thugs who haven't got guns with no fear of dying.  I am sure there are more, I have however, not played for long and will edit upon completion.  Pros  - Batmobile  Yes, it's a pro as well. This feature will probably cause you to write a positive or negative review in the end once you get past the problem with frame rate. You cannot avoid using it, it's a fundamental part of Batman. What I like is it feels powerful. The sounds when you drive, the destruction of the enviroment, comments from thugs as you chase their vehicles or appear on the scene. It's truly a great addition in my humble opinion and although it has been used a lot, I don't mind, I enjoy it's use and feel a lot more like Batman when I can glind between missions, or arm myself with missles, wheel spin out of a tunnel and blow cannon holes in a few walls to get there. Needless to say I also enjoy the side missions with this vehicle requiring your skills as a driver.  - Story  I won't ruin anything. It's been a pleasure though, the script portrays realistic reactions to certain sitiuations you face and the voice acting is simply amazing.   - General comments I can't subtitle.  The atmosphere is great in this, it really feels like Gotham is in trouble, it feels like even away from the story elements, driving and helping a police vehicle is also affecting the enviroment. Hearing 'It's the Batman' as you blow up someones car is strangely satisfying. Another element I love is the detective side, it's really well done and I enjoy using the scanning elements, it just really feels like you're in control of Batman.  I'm one of those players that likes walking slowly up to a group of people, letting them attack me while slowly beating them up, calling my Batmobile to then crash into them, or a well timed batarang as they are about to hit me with a punch to knock them out, which draws me to combat. Simply put, you're Batman, thugs wouldn't stand a chance, so who cares if it's easy, it makes beating up large groups that much more satisfying to do.  I haven't commented on everything and as said previously, will add more in time. However if it seems like you can get over frame rate issues then by all means buy this game. In spite of reviews they are mostly aimed at performance, which you really shouldn't ignore, pointless buying if you can't play. However I haven't experienced this and thought I would just clarify that beyond that is a great experience.  Best of luck.",

She's been one of my favourite characters in the DC Universe for years now, and they really knocked her design out of the park in this game. Her fighting style is a blast play with, as it's so satisfying to crack a baddie upside the head with her bat!  This feels exactly like how I want an Arkham game to feel like. Batman controls seamlessly, glides effortlessly, and the new Batmobile mechanics are a really fun add on to the franchise! (I'm a big fan of racing games, so driving around in B-Man's mobile is fun as hell!) The combat is perfect, as to be expected from an Arkham title. There are also some neat new ways to takedown enemies that feel like they've always been a part of the franchise. Rocksteady really knows how to add onto the series without ruining any aspects of the franchise that people have come to love (and expect) from these titles.  I have played the original Batman: Arkham Asylum over 5 times now, and the respective sequels at least twice. This game is a most welcome addition to the franchise, and I look forward to completing it! Well worth the wait!!  Pros: - Georgeous art direction and design. This game is simply stunning to look at. - Engaging story telling, and dialogue. The voice acting is top-notch. - New gameplay mechanics (The Batmobile, new combat takedowns, etc.) - Smooth controls, and flawless combat -- as fun as ever! - Great soundtrack  Neutral: - Occasionally hard to follow directions/waypoints (but that could just be me)  Cons: - Terrible launch from Rocksteady. The game is broken for the majority of PC players, and they knowingly released it regardless. - There are several reports of players not reciving their Pre-Order bonus despite having pre-ordered the game. (In that same line, those who purchased specific graphics cards were given free copies of the game, only to have the pre-order bonuses taken away from them 1 hour before launch -- despite technically pre-owning the game)  [These cons may be edited out depending on how Rocksteady handles the complants. As of day 1, it's been a tough launch for this game]  For those having issues: have patience!! It's only day one, and yes it's terrible of Rocksteady to release a game with so many issues, but once they get it working properly for everyone, I hope that this game gets the proper credit it deserves!",

The motion blur is so extreme that it's disorienting, especially when moving at high speeds. Hopefully they patch it, and the game can be enjoyed on the PC.

The 30 frame cap is a little disappointing but if you have a good basic understanding of a pc a little editing in the BmSystemSettings file isn't really a hard thing to do. However from the other batman installments/games had a large amount of graphical option's in it and should of been implemented in this game. but lets take a second and understand that not all people are computer savvy and that there is somewhat of a boom in computer sales as parts are becoming cheaper and cheaper to buy. So game developer's/studio's are trying to make it easier for people just to install and play. this is why the console version are some what polished as the hardware variants are limted making it easier to develop and making it look good to (i was going to say amazing but PC's are so much better).  So all of that said the studio is blame here however lets face it most game this days are a little buggy after release. so.... im happying with this game but in the future rocksteady look to the past tiltes and use that to set the bar and go above and beyond that standard but it takes time to achieve a good and polished game.  So the people who read this review keep an open mind to this issue as the media/Internet articles is only blowing up about the graphical issue and not telling you about how good and thought provoking the story of the batman really is.  I will not score this game out of a number or anything like that.

A capped 30fps for a pc port had alarm bells ringing straight off...  I thought AC Unity was bad but in its current state many pc users will find this game unplayable given the poor optimisation and sloppy pc porting. I am partly to blame for preordering (the one time i do lol); certainly learnt the hard way not to do that.  Now the positives: Ive played 25 h to complete the main campaign and the actual story, gameplay mechanics, open world are really good (the story in particular wraps up nicely and the game is very hard to stop playing because of the excellent story progression). This is probably my favourite arkham series episode of the trilogy because of the underlying satisfying substance of the game. Too bad and though i recommend the game I don't suggest you consider buying at present (you cant anyway) given its poor execution on pc...

I also started getting the hang of the batmobile after some practice with it during gameplay.   However, the graphics are not up to par. There are low quality or missing textures,some scenes which should take my breath away looked like they were from the PS3 era. The graphics options are a joke - the highest texture setting is 'Normal' - seriously??? What the ♥♥♥♥?   I didn't build a powerful gaming PC and drop money on a historically very high quality game to put up with this kind of treatment. Warner Bros says Rocksteady themselves optimzed the game for consoles and an external party did it for PC. WTF! I don't like being treated like second rate, and that too so shoddily.   I would definitely recommend waiting until all the problems are declared fixed, then waiting a month more to ensure that is indeed correct, then buy it on steam sale. Shame on you WB. ",

            "review_text": "So I preordered Arkham Knight for $25 during a summer sale and started playing the night of the release. I notice the default graphics were set very low (not even 1920 x 1080 res). After upping the graphics to normal (said my graphic card couldnt use high settings) the gameplay got choppy (about every 10 sec). Apparently its a lot worse for other people especially AMD cards where the game is unplayable.   -I'm using a EVEA 670 gtx Nvidia card if you're wondering  Anyways I'm playing on low settings with little lag issues. The graphic seemed as good as Arkham City on xbox 360, so I'm not too bummed about that plus they said they were working on it. Other than this big issue the game is awesome. Great additions in enemies, combat, gadgets, leveling system, and mechanics. My only worry with the game before its release was that the batmobile was gonna be overbearing in the structure of the game. Luckily I now welcome the batmobile into the game with open arms, and my favorite part of the game is still fun, stealth.   I'm about 23% completed and there's a good amount of cameos, bat jokes, old school references for any hard core Bat fans. For those that aren't Bat-fans its just a purely fun game anyways. I won't spoil anything, but if you like mind games this is a great game for you.  Hopefully they fix the bugs and we all can get this 'bad taste' out of our mouths. If not for those I'm sure the game would be shooting for 10/10 rating. I would recommend this game, but wait for the bugs to get fixed (they wont let you buy it anyways). I guess we can consider this closed beta 2/ gamma testing. Btw I'm not a fan of the favoritism consoles get these days. You would think the better platform would be the main priority and then water it down for use on the console later. PC, the black sheep of cross platforms. Could be worse we could be a wii waiting for a cross platform game to even move to it.",

I have a good feeling they will fix the issues and all of us can enjoy this game on our PC's the way we do on our consoles. I refuse to add things to this review that do not exist so let me say only this:  AMD cards beware. Nvidia great as long as it is a high end one with at least 3gb of ram. Not many graphical options. Not sure why this is. To increase your frame rate you have to modify the INI file. This should not be that way. No game should be released on PC capped at 30FPS. That is crazy. As for my game play so far I have had a blast.   I recommend only because I know they will fix it.  Enjoy.",

            "review_text": "It's really hard to give this game a negative recommendation. I'm a huge, huge Batman fan. If this had been any other game, I would have gotten an immediate refund. I also picked it up for 35$, so that's a factor here. People shouldn't pay 60$ for a digital release of a PC game, much less one full of so many issues. After being delayed this long, I really can't understand why it's in it's current state. While I haven't had all the issues other people have, I have had the game crash numerous times with errors claiming the main exe file could not be found, and other random errors.    I have not experienced low res textures, however I have noticed odd 'texture walls' in the streets that I could walk through and still interact with the world, but not really see anything inside them or function. It looked like a texture from nearby buildings was being blown up to massive blurry proportions, and stretched behind the face of the model. I've also experienced very choppy frame rates, most noticeable when dealing with the Batmobile (either entering or driving). I've had no apparent issues with the Nvidia effects turned on, which, along with everything else, seems to indicate the problems are texture related.    As for the positives, It's Batman. Need I say more? The voice work is fantastic, when the graphics are working properly, the game is gorgeous in it's own Gotham-y way, and while sometimes tricky to figure out some of the special counters for specific enemies while you fight them, the combat is a ton of fun. I really can't get over the moody, detailed environments, and just twirl around staring at everything when I walk into a new area.  If Rocksteady had taken care of it's PC customers, this would be a no brainer purchase.    It's really disappointing that once again, the PC was not the lead platform for a high profile game that looks so beautiful, and had so much work put into it otherwise. This is what happens when you don't take care of ALL your customers, and farm out a port to another studio. I hope this is taken care of for everyone quickly, and developers learn from this disastrous launch.    Until all the issues are fixed, and you can pick it up a bit cheaper, hold off and try not to get spoiled on the great story.  Update: After multiple crashes, I decided to give the game a break, and then the first patch came out. I was glad they addressed the crashing on exit problem, which I hoped would fix my crashes also. The first time playing again, my save game is now apparently unusable. I was killed at a watchtower and when the game loaded back up, I immediately started falling through the world. I can glide for a bit, but can't seem to get up above the border of the world. I managed to make my way to the water, hoping it would detect this and grapple me up, but no luck. I really wish every game would go back to having console commands, because a noclip cheat would do wonders right now. Looking for a free trainer instead. Very annoying.  More texture bugs in the world when gliding and opening the map. One of my screen shots shows the map one.  I also lost the damaged suit when I switched skins in the menu to see what they looked like. So far it looks like no one's found a solution to this. It really takes away from the game.  Also ran into a problem in Panessa Studios, trying to get a Riddler trophy in a room of bots, that you can only get to through a floor grate. Once my time expired, the message stayed on the screen and I couldn't get back through the grate. I had to let them kill me.  There seem to be a lot of instances where messages will stay up on the screen for much longer than they should. I find it hard to believe this would be intentional.  Another bug where the drone helicopters respawn after clearing the area, and they're in the sky at the same time as GCPD helicopters. There were 4 or 5 of them, and then I destroyed 1, Batman gave the all clear to Cash even though there were 4 more in the sky.  Odd 'smeared' textures seem to be present even in the main menu when exiting the game, after they appear during gameplay.",

This game is basically unplayable, well un-enjoyable anyway, and should have never been released until it was polished. I have a decent rig (above recommened specs) with an AMD R9 290x so there should be no issues with power yet I am unable to get a playable framerate even though this game is locked at 30fps (WTF 30fps? Is this a console or a PC?). I love the Arkham series so I figured I would try it out at 30fps and hopefully I would enjoy the gameplay so much that it wouldn't matter. Problem is I can't enjoy the game if I can't even get a reliable enough framerate to play it. This game at this stage is absolute garbage and there are many, many early access games that are far more polished than this turd. WB and Rocksteady should be ashamed of this terrible port and it should be pulled immediatly until it is playable.

But ignoring the technicalities it is a very fun game to play with perfected arkham style combat and predator scenarios and the batmobile which can be fun but is a bit overused in this game. The story is also good and ties up many loose ends from city.  But half a year later after many patches i buy the game on sale and i see a VERY improved game. Let me be honest and say that i am getting a FLAWLESS 60fps running on high settings (no gameworks) in 1920x1080.   The only issues i have noticed is after 2hrs game time there were two moments where the frame rate dropped to 40 but it was in a second so no complaints really. The other issue is the PhysX seem to be janky as things objects and clothing on characters like to jump around for no reason but its pretty minor. I think overall if you pick this up on a sale for £18 like i did and you have a rig similar to mine(I7-4790k, GTX 970, 16GB RAM) you will think it is is a worthy buy.",

WELCOME TO PC GAMING. I usually wait to buy games on steam until they go on sale for 75% off, But I made a point to buy this game after I saw that WB Games was going to take the time to make it better. I think they have done a really good job making the game playable and I have not encountered any problems too different from most other problems accompanying pc games. There are specific reasons PC Gamers prefer PC to console. It allows us to make adjustments and get things the way we like it. In short if you are really a console gamer at heart who likes to turn it on and go, or if you do not have the recommended specs, then this game is not for you; But if you enjoy figuring out how to get the max fps and work through the various challenges that accompany most pc games then I think you will find that this game is overall very playable and enjoyable. PS.(What more do all you haters want? WB first of all offered the other batman games to anyone who had purchased the game when they didn't have to offer anything and now they have offered a full return until december no matter how long you've played! I don't know of any company that has done this in the past. It sounds like some of you won't be happy until wb offers 1000 dollars payment for the inconvenience they've caused and then blows up their own headquarters so they can never make a game again. WB Games has earned alot of respect in my book and I for one will be keeping this game in my library.",

I would say I am fortunate compared to most people experiencing horrible issues with game. I have a i5-4670k, 16GB RAM and a GTX 970. I will still have to give this a downvote until hardware issues are addressed.  That being said, my actual review of the game. Essentially all of your gadgets are unlocked. If you wanted the gadget puzzles you experienced in Asylum, look elsewhere. This game is mostly about the batmobile and solving puzzles with your batmobile. I have to say, I really like the batmobile and the driving is very smooth and responsive compared to other games (looking at you Watchdogs).  Rocksteady has once again filled with an engaging and emotional story. And it was a good end to the Arkham franchise.",

            "review_text": "Review edit on January 1, 2016:  I repurchased AK after awaiting the patches and getting a new graphics card (Radeon R390). The game is really smooth now, so I can leave the complaints behind and focus on the content. I understand, though, that it's still a troublemaker for quite a few PC setups, so there's that still.  Anyways, I will make this fairly short. It's a polished title whose tried-and-true mechanics work like a charm. It's definitely worth playing, and there's lots to do, with crime scene investigations, Riddler shenanigans, tank battles, Predator sequences that have been seamlessly integrated into the games environment and thus feel less like set pieces... I recommend it, because it's fun.   Having said that, let me focus on what I didn't like. It's quite a lot, actually, and this will make it sound like it's a bad game. Let me reassure you, it's not. But it's a good game held back from being great by a bunch of design flaws.  1. The character models. WTF happened? They are all uglier than their previous counterparts. Yes, they're incredibly detailed, but... where should I start? Catwoman's pug nose? Batman's 'stomach ulcer' jowls? Poison Ivy's ragged heroin undernourished ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ look? I load up Arkham City and weep.   2. The car. Oh, the car. The developers gave it their all, and thus, it seems like Batman got a favourite toy that he just doesn't want to let go of. Don't get me wrong: it's well-implemented, although the driving itself takes some getting used to. The battles are tactical and fun, chase scenes are gripping, and it plays a part in some riddles, giving these a genuinely new dimension. But damn, it takes up so much playtime, that I was always glad to eject it and go flying over Gotham like I used to. In fact, I left the car behind whenever I could. Take note that it turns AK into a driving game (at least 40% of it).   3. Riddler riddles are getting old. And I just find it hard to believe that the Riddler would go to all these lengths AGAIN, never mind the plausibility of the first few games. But going after those question marks again... maybe I'll just leave Catwoman with him and call it a (k)night. Pure ennui.  4. There's too much of everything. Yes, open world games constantly try to better one another by having a tonful of content for you to 'enjoy'. More often than naught, this amounts to doing the same tedious things over and over and over. And then there's the decisions to be made that constantly undermine the game's believability. Oh yeah, Barbara is about to be murdered by a maniac, but let me calmly check out these victims instead. Not to mention collecting little question marks - these have to take precedent, sorry, Babs.   5. Rehashing old enemies instead of introducing some lesser known, but still interesting foes. Now, some really hated the Joker in this game, but I thought it was only fair, seeing as this is the conclusion of a trilogy that had the Joker take center stage for two games. But Firefly? Again? I never liked firefly, and writers have always struggled to make him interesting. Riddler? Penguin? Yawner.   6. The controls. Yes, a PC gamer's favourite gripe. But there are so many combos now, that it takes quite a while to master them. And even if you have (nothing against a learning curve if it makes sense), you'll still be hard put to unleash certain combos in the heat of battle (ALT-3? Really? Are you kidding??)  7. The ending. Well, yeah, of course the AK identity was clear to anyone who's followed the Dark Knight's adventures for the past 30 years, I didn't mind that at all. But... well, I won't give it away. Suffice to say that it was so out of character... I found it jolting.   So yeah, worth playing, but short of being great... by a mile. Arkham City remains my favourite.",

Then, they promise to fix it 'soon'. They then go silent about the PC version for 3 months. Throughout all of this, Rocksteady was working on all of the DLC's for the PS4 version, which I guess was more important to them. Keep in mind, 3 months after launch some people still had never seen the start menu yet and the only word they got from WB was that they don't deserve the game they payed for.  Come September they released a patch that fixed many of the problems for most people. That would be great if it didn't break the game for others who once had no problems. They then put it back on Steam for $50.00 and released all of the DLC. The people who payed for the game got no compensation. It wasn't until December, 6 months after release, when they 'rewarded' all of the people who stuck with them with skins and games they already had. Blackgate isn't a gift, it's a joke.   In the DLC's, they actually made you pay $10 for 20 minute story-packs. They just released the last wave of DLC, featuring the derpy 2008 Batman skin and a $10 DLC featuring 40 minutes worth of content. Nothing this game has put out has been worth any money. They even called reviews from before November 'pre-release reviews.'   Don't buy until it's $5.00 during a Christmas sale. Anything more than that is just rewarding WB for releasing garbage.",

It makes you feel like Batman, taking down multiple enemies flawlessly. Multi stealth takedowns. Tag team takedowns. Extremely fun. All the side quests were fun as well. They incorporated a bunch of enemies and provided kind of an RPG aspect to it. I enjoyed it.  Story = predictable. If you know anything about the Batman universe, you'll know pretty much what happens and what to expect. No surprises at all.  The annoying parts. Batmobile was thrown in your face all the time. Eventually you get used to it but I wish it wasn't so highly emphasized. The other annoying part was the Riddler stuff. I realized that Arkham City had more so I can't speak for that one. But holy hell it was extremely annoying to 100% the game. It just makes it more satisfying when you punch him in the face.

With every risk comes a gamble. Unfortunately, throwing your eggs in one basket is a risk that didn't quite pay off. Rocksteady really went all-out with the Bat tank. Very cool mechanic but grossly over-used as the game becomes a race track/tank battle arena.  What annoyed me the most was incorporating car SFX with Batman's punches. 'Yes, the Bat tank is cool' but not that cool.  As traditional with Arkham games were epic boss battles. You will get none of that In Arkham Knight. Not necessarily a bad thing if you can balance out Batman's encounters and detective work as well as a good story with fleshed out villains.

I run it on an 8MB LGA775 based Quad core at 2.5 Ghz w/GT730 and it yields a pretty decent framerate at 1280x720.  Multiple skins for Batman, Robin, Catwoman and the Batmobile which can be used in Campaign mode. Once you've completed the main campaign, you can even play with all of the historic Batmobiles in the campaign world. So that means driving the Batmobile from the 1960s television series, the 1980s Batmobile, the Tumbler from the Dark Knight and even the Superman vs Batman Batmobile as well. That alone is an awesome feature let alone getting to choose which Batman you prefer for the campaign. If Rocksteady is indeed contracted to bring Superman (or Justice League) to an open world storyline, based upon my experiences with Arkham Knight, I'd bet that it would be awesome. If Marvel pays attention, they'll meet the open world gaming concept with an offering of their own with the Avengers or a key character like Iron Man or Captain America. They'll have a fair bit to live up when it comes to matching the great experience of playing Arkham Knight.  Great pacing and loads of content if you buy the version with all the DLCs included. Great replayibility even after you've finished the main campaign.  Highly recommended.",

Pros: - The story is probably the best of any game, ever - Voice acting is as well - Graphics are crazy good - Word design is amazing - Driving the batmobile is flawless - Creative new ways of fighting enemies - Tons of content - Innovative storytelling and side missions  Cons: - It's over :(  This is one of those games where you can lose a weekend playing, and I highly recommend doing so! Definitely a step up from the previous games, and those were amazing.",

            "review_text": "(Edit Nov. 1, 2016)  Cutting to the chase the game has had no more support but they did fix most of the issues. SLI or anyother multiple GPU configuration is still ill advised since it causes more issues than performance increases. With all the DLC adding what fans wanted, challenge packs, as well as adding farm more skins than what people ever wanted and expanded the story, I can safely say that this game is worth the buy. Despite not being the best port right now and support is cut off I hope Rocksteady learns to not to allow a 3rd party team work on a PC port. Have fun and BE THE BATMAN.   -------------------------------------------------------Old Review------------------------------------------------------------------ OVERALL: -1/10 (You owe me a point for buying this game and wasting time just trying to get it to work)  Day ONE review and PERFORMANCE:  I WAS NOT going to leave a review, I hardly ever do because of the way I play a game is on the intent of breaking it. This review is similar to the others you'll see. Either way everyone dropped the ball on this one Rocksteady didn't ensure the title was ready for release and NVIDIA coded like I did as a freshman, trash.   My rig is a GTX 690, 64 gigs of Corsair Dominator Ram, I have this on a crucial SSD 500 gig, and a octacore 3.7 GHz cpu. I've played Skyrim for over 600 hours with 255 mods that make it look better than this game running at 40 fps while recording. The issue behind this game is the terrible efficiency. The game only uses 2 gigs of my 4 gig video card. I've been playing around with the settings for hours between my computer and the game to no avail.  I could tolerate the frame rate drop from 30 fps to 10 fps if momentary. However I can't even continue the story. Now it outright crashes at the same point in the story every time. I guess you win this time scarecrow, you found a way to stop the Bat.  BUY OR NO BUY:  Do not BUY yet...maybe the Dark Knight will rise from the ashes of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ programmers but I would suggest they need to do that one from scratch. Too many bugs to count.  FOREWORD:  P.S. I so desparately wanted this game to succeed. That weakness in me made a clear hesitation upon creating this review. I'll change it appropriately as patches come out.  EDIT(January 4, 2016): Game is fixed for the most part but still has PC exclusive issues. Depending on your machine I would recommend the buy. For the average person it is still a thumbs down.",

If you like the other Batman games, you know what to expect (with a lot more car). A good deal of story, lots of challenges and lots of filler to rack up your playtime (take down x number of bases, take out x number of towers).  Overall, I would recommend this very highly.",

Another common complaint is the batmobile being an annoying minigame, and yes - I kinda agree. I like options, doing it without the batmobile for example. Many puzzles require it the same way you use a gadget, but the batmobile kind of breaks the flow. But still... It was a cool addition regardless. It didn't ruin the game at all, just a minor annoyance here an there. The storyline was on par with Asylum and City, it kept me interested all the way. Next playthrough I'll get the DLCs for sure.",

I have to say it runs well, is extremely fun (right up there with Arkham City) and I have not found driving the batmobile to be at all tedious. Rather the opposite, I'm having a blast with the batmobile!   Granted, the game as a whole has Batman (and his car) being unbelievably violent for someone who is driven to never try to kill anyone (that criticism still stands), but one can (for the sake of a cool game and decent story) suspend one's disbelief and go with the sci-fi invented punches. There is even a story element to perhaps explain the Bat's escalating violence.   The worst part of the game for me remains the beginning (no spoilers) which is easily a hard R horror movie compared to the vast majority of the rest of the game (and I've played through about 70% of the main plot and finished several side plots). If you are shocked by the beginning, just hang in there. But be warned: if you don't like horror, you may find a few of the enemy characters to be well, well beyond the 'comic book violence' standard (especially due to a few torture scenes, both portrayed and heavily implied).",

Bringing back one of the main villians of the series, introducing a few new one, and bringing new friends with familiar faces to tie it all together. Interesting story larger area, and great atomsphere give this series the ending it deserves.  AK leans a bit too heavily on the batmobile, I didn't mind it as much but I can see how it might get annoying.   Combat is great as usual. It's the normal arkham affair of counter this, punch that, takedown there. It's deeper know though, you can still do base level mechanics or you can do some of the really advanced mechanics, like scooping people off the ground and back into stand position. However the camera doesn't always send your character towards the person you want to hit.  Challenge maps are difficult and some can be maddening, picking certain characters leaves you at a distinct disadvantage as you may be unable to get rid of firearms, tasers, or shields. It's kind of a hard mode there, so you can take that or leave it.  DLC is kinda meh, not amazing (except for the stories, they're cool) but you're not missing anything (get the stories though).",

I watched a friend play and played a little myself on his PC, it seems okay. Not sure if more updates were applied though.  132 hours and I still have not beaten this game... Everytime a patch is released it is just a new set of problems. I have made it to 92% completion three times and then something goes wrong that stops me from moving on. I have really loved this series until this game. The game hasn't crashed in a while, but there are a lot of stutters during chases with the batmobile; which there is a lot of forced batmobile gameplay. I know I have been curious about what builds and settings have been working for this game, so I will list computer specs and settings at the bottom. I do not recommend this game YET; wait until more is fixed and it is much lower in price.  Pros:  - Graphics are nice when working - Fear takedowns are pretty awesome - Team fights with allies are fun - Joker and Riddler are funny - Voice acting is really well done - Cool extras  Cons:  - Story isn't well thought out - Some boss fights I felt like the devs just stopped caring - Will fall through the streets and game will save with you down there - Batmobile missions are really generic - Too much focus on the batmobile gameplay really takes away from batman as a whole - Combos like B,A,A on sheilded enemies doesn't work 98% percent of the time - Most of the upgrades for the gadgets are worthless - DLC is really short  Specs: (All stock speeds)  WIN 10 on 128 GB SSD Steam on 500 GB SSD AMD FX-8370E 3.3 GHZ MSI 990fxa MOBO MSI R9 390 16 GB Corsair Vengence RAM 1000W Corsair PSU ViewSonic XG Monitor with FreeSync enabled  Graphic options:  Display Mode: Fullscreen Resolution: 1920x1080 V-Sync: Off Max FPS: 90 Texture Resolution: High Shadow Quality: High Level of Detail: High Motion Blur: Off Anti-Aliasing: Off (Going to turn on to see if this stops me from falling through the streets) Chromatic Aberation: Off Film Grain: Off Texture Filtering: Trilinear (Going to adjust to see if it helps with falling through the streets)  Enhanced Rain: Off Enhanced Light Shafts: Off",

I've had msi afterburner running and I have noticed that my vram usage is consistantly at 3.5gb. gpu usage isn't too high either (80-90%ish). Haven't checked cpu utilization. One thing I have noticed is that my ram usage is 10.3gb total (7.4gb of that for the game) which is the highest I've ever seen so the rumours of a memory leak could be founded, or it could just use a lot of ram, I really can't say.

However my bottom line is be careful if you only have 8gb of ram or less or an amd gpu. A tentative recommendation to people with similar specs.  Update: The lack of a sufficient patch almost TWO MONTHS after release has resulted in me switching my review to a negative one. TWO MONTHS and you can't fix it. How broken was it that you can't fix it in that time?  Also ♥♥♥♥ the developers for having the fight with deathstroke be a pathetic tank battle. If I've done all of the bomb, watchtower and checkpoint missions I want to fight deathstroke with explosions going off all around us, break his sword and then punch him in the face. I don't want to slowly stalk him in the batmobile occasionally shooting him. CMON, who did you think would enjoy that!",

The combat and movement is really smooth, especially the transition between them, the city is absolutely humongous (what else do you expect from a city with 6.3 million residents) and in the moments that this game actually runs well it looks beautiful.  However, I don't recommend the game in it's current state for the same reason as others have stated; it's a horrible PC port. Hell, even AC: Unity was a better PC port than this. I've got the recommended specs (gtx 760 and i7 3770) yet running this game at a mixed low-normal video profile is too much to ask. While I'm able to run the game at 50 to 60 fps drops to &gt;20 fps are overly present, no matter what I do. There are however certain situations that seem to lure these drops more than others, the most prominent ones being: -Calling/Driving the batmobile; -Tabbing out and back in, this absolutely kills the frames which could only be fixed by restarting; -Going from an indoors area to an outdoors area.  In it's current state you should not buy the game, even if you've got an entire render farm in your basement, just to get Rocksteady to get their ♥♥♥♥ together.

Many games, myself included got the game with a video card upgrade. This was supposed to count as a preorder which would give us all the preorder DLC. WB decided mere hours before launch 'Nah, ♥♥♥♥ you' and removed the preorder bonus we were told we would get. Not only that but they changed the min specs an hour before launch for AMD users.  They literally waited till the last possible second to screw over customers all in a ploy to push their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 40 dollar season pass.   Then to top off the ♥♥♥♥ cake that is WB games, the exec Director of Marketing for WB games went on record saying PC gamers upset over these issues are nothing but 'Bunch of babies'.

This doesn't mean there are no criticism to make: -the lack of bosses is really a big big drawback. Knight misses some of the most memorable encounters such as Bane in Asylum, or Ra's Al Ghul in City. -if you're as familiar as me with the Arkham games, this one is going to be cakewalk even on hard mode.  But in any case, this does NOT make how WB and Rocksteady behaved acceptable in any way, and I doubt PC gamers will forget that soon.

I didn't have this problem when I was starting my save, but after I completed the main storyline and all of the DLC and Most Wanted save the Riddler, I was trying to get all of the trophies and the game continously crashes after ten minutes of play. Again, it was running reasonably well my first 25 hours, but then suddenly I complete the story and everything goes to hell. But that's ok. You're probably wondering why I am still recommending this game.  It's because, as a big fan of the Arkham series, this game is amazing. All of the criticism I heard when going in, about the Batmobile and how it was used too much, and how the story isn't good or whatever people are saying, it proved to be completely unfounded. I REALLY loved this game, and I had a ton of fun playing it. The formula hasn't changed since City, you are still the Batman, fighting arena-style combat against hordes of enemies. There are a couple new types, like the medic, the charging guys, and the big guys that aren't berzerkers but still can't be taken out with silent takedowns (they are pretty annoying). The game is well designed and looks really good, especially because everything takes place in a rainy Gotham at night. I thought the Batmobile was amazingly fun to play and to upgrade, and I felt that it wasn't overused at all. It's only really the side missions that see the Batmobile used a lot, and they were still fun.  There are several DLC missions that help to pad the length of kind-of a short campaign, and I feel that they were worth it to buy. That's why I got the season pass (on sale) and I think I got my money's worth. However, none of the missions were particularly memorable to me. I thought they were ok, but after getting to play them, I don't think I would bother getting them at full price. But if this game is on sale, and you're a fan of the Arkham games or just like Batman, then this game is a really good addition to the series and the franchise in general. If you can handle the performance, at least.",

The stupid Riddler trophy collection mission that is just tedious farming and has been present in all of the other Batman Arkham whatever games. What is worse, they prevent you from seeing the full ending as well as closing that mission unless you actually go and collect them all. It is a part of the game that should have been entirely optional for crap like pictures of characters and costumes and other perks, but not a requirement.  2. The ending is just pure crap. I really shouldn't have been surprised by a company that actually kills Batman villians. I won't give spoilers for the endling, but it was a let down. I realize that Rocksteady and DC have presented this as a new story based upon the comics, but that statement that is even more crap. They use all of the actual comic book lore but decide to do something radical like kill a character or other moves that are clearly meant to drive sales and then chalk it up to that lame excuse.  3. If you are guilable enough to beleive all of the hype about the Arkham Knight being an all-new character, be ready for more disappointment. It is a rip-off of an existing Batman comic book character with a new name and outfit attempting to sell it as something new but pretty much reverts it all back to the comic book story as it plays out.  Other than those three points, the rest of the game play, characters, missions and story are amazing with pretty awesome graphics and sound.

The game is beautiful and I am impressed on how much framerate I got (60-40 FPS) and it only got bad when driving the batmobile (30 straight).   The game itself has been improved with a faster and more comic-book-like feel combat system, better graphics all around, and a very big open world setting. I have played both Arkham City and Arkham Origins and I love how the traversed into this game.   Some bad things about this game is the over-use of the Batmobile. Yes it is cool to zoom around and climb up walls, but we do not need it for everything. Batman wouldn't of used Batmobile this much, especially during a thing like the Riddler's puzzles. Another thing is the same plot device over and over. You'll see once you play it.   The overall story is good and fun to play (especially when Nightwing is introduced.) and can present a challenge from time to time, which is a good thing.  It captures all the elements from previous Batman games and it is lovely to see the continuation. I give this game a 7/10.

But with a sorrow heart, I really can't recommend this version of the game. While Rocksteady has made plenty of fixes (and im somewhat glad I waited to buy this game), there are still many optimization issues. There are some parts where its running at a solid 60fps and then it would freeze up for a few seconds screwing up any combo that I had prior. I also had a somewhat annoying issue with 1.8gb of stuff either missing or corrupted which halted my gameplay for a good 30 minutes as I was trying to get past a simple cutscene. If anything, I'd say wait for the price to drop a little bit, especially for the premium edition since the stuff in the package is quite fun. Hopefully they do a few more patches to fix this game. The potential for a really good Arkham game is here, but they really need to fix their sh*t.",

            "review_text": "Batman: Arkham Knight, a game that manages to accomplish many feats, despite the hurdles it faced due to its (not so steady as a rock) launch.  As a rather well-seasoned reader of the Batman comic books and graphic novels, an experience such as this and the other games in the Arkham series is most welcome. Having been waiting for this game in particular for years, since the tremendously thrilling and rather daring ending to Arkham City, which is still one of my favourite games, as I continue to cherish its brilliance. After the long years of waiting for this epic conclusion, I can't for a second say that I was disappointed. The game itself - As a game, a playable experience, Batman: Arkham Knight takes the player, playing as Batman/Bruce Wayne himself on a journey mostly unlike every other adventure he's ever been on. The level design is incredible, pitting you against your foes in imaginative ways, still, the levels are usually as open as you'd like them to be. The city of Gotham has never been depicted in such a beautiful manner, with it constantly being reshaped to keep the game looking fresh as well as giving you other things to adjust to and different sights to behold. The combat that Rocksteady has become famous for, which has often been said to set the bar for combat systems in such third-person adventure games, continues to improve. It feels faster and more fluid than ever before and makes you feel invulnerable once you master the technique of beating Gotham's scum in every way one could imagine, whilst also punishing you, should you become overconfident and forget your basics. The Batmobile is drivable, as you should know if you've already made your way to this review. It is a welcomed addition, due to its genuine Batman feel and empowers the player with the power of what is essentially a high-speed tank. However, personally, the game seems to overuse the batmobile at some points in ways that don't quite seem believable even in the world of Bamtan, for instance: Riddler's race tracks replacing most of his logic puzzles.  The story - Personally, I believe this to be one of the best stories within a game that I've ever witnessed, with the twists and turns that keep it exciting, brutalising Bruce's memories to draw sympathy from the player, immersing them in the want to defeat the villains at hand. The story follows Batman as he tries to stop the Scarecrow from releasinga new, more potent and disastrous version of his infamous fear toxin. As he closes in on the scarecrow and his evil plans, the evil-doer's brand new henchman steps in, in all his mystique. Obviously with a vendetta against the Bat of Gotham, the mysterious new Arkham Knight maintains a sense of urgency throughout the game, as you attempt to uncover the terror that lies beneath his mask. This offers an interesting and exciting section to the main campaign,at times seeming strong enough to support its own subplot. Graphics - Depending on what device you play Batman: Arkham Knight, you can see huge differences in the level of detail some of these world-renowned developes have gone to. It was a true shame that the launch of the game was completely undermined on PC by the apparently appalling port from consoles.However, having played and completed the game on both the Xbox One and PC (post-patch), I can honestly say that it was worth the wait. The game's beauty hides in the darker details of the characters and the city itself. And if you get the final DLC 'Season of Infamy', the beard gracing Jervis Tetch's face forced my jaw down in awe. DLC - Sadly, this is the main gripe that I have with the game, although it doesn't spoil the game itself. The vast majority of the dowloadable content is utter tripe, if you really crave more of the side characters, such as Batgirl, Robin, Nightwing and so on, then the first few DLC packs are just for you. Hoever, they are around twenty minutes in length and are as shallow as that 17 year-old blonde girl in high school that everyone liked a little more than made sense. They offer no closure to the stories within the campaign itself and aren't satisfying in the slightest and feel more like a chore than an enjoyable extension of the game. However, the final downloadable content pack called 'Season of Infamy' is the complete opposite, as it offers closure to several characters, such as Mad Hatter, Killer Croc, Mr. Freeze and the tie-up I had really been waiting for since Arkham City: Ra's Al Ghul. Conclusion - In my opinion, as this entire review is, Batman: Arkham Knight is a gaming masterpiece, its story fulfills the perfect setting to highlight the experience that a developer such as Rocksteady can immerse a player in, providing a gratifying conclusion to the Arkham series. As a game and an overall experience, Arkham Knight delivers on every level. As this review was written a year and six days after its release, I feel like it is more of an attempt at thanking the hard-working developers at the Rocksteady. And so, thank you for reading, and if anyone at Rocksteady is reading, thank you so much for creating some of the most enjoyable content to me. If you genuinely wanted a review to see if it's worth buying, I'd say so, whether or not you're a big fan of the Dark Knight. By now, it's pretty cheap , and if you want more, definitely invest in the 'Season of Infamy' as it was a satisfying closure to the masterfully created series, Thanks.",

This is easy to ignore though. Beyond that, this is an excellent game.

It's awesome, what did you expect? It builds on the previous games and adds better combat, graphics, and world. I also had a lot of fun with the batmobile. I know a lot of people didn't like it, but me personally I had a great time with it. There may have been a few too many tank battles, but other than that I had a lot of fun.

Now, I can definitely see why. Running on MSI R9 390 at 1060 CC, this game (for me) didn't go under 30 fps yet (running with a 8-core and 16 GB RAM) but I did find where the framerate tanked and this is with all settings turned to maximum with V-Sync on, Motion Blur Off, Chromatic Aberration Off and Film Grain Off. When you go too fast, you can go under 40 fps easily and some sections of the city really tank the performances. I did maintain a better framerate in closed areas like the Batmobile races and most buildings.  I'm glad to see more options available for the graphics but it's not as good as Shadow of Mordor which runs really well on my system, another game from Warner but developed and ported in-house by Monolith. I do believe that if the game, as of right now, would be released, we wouldn't have got the scandal (and rightfully so it was). However, if you run on a lower system than I do and it's just an example, I cannot recommend that you buy this game even on sale. For all others, it's up to you to take a risk but bear in mind: this is definitely better than last year... However, let us be clear: Warner Bros, you should know better than this. So basically, this is a mixed review when it comes to performances. If you run on a system better than mine, give it a chance but only if this game is on sale. Otherwise, avoid it at all costs.",

First review I have ever made and what better way to start it now after playing the ♥♥♥♥ out of this (currently 97% total game completion) ATTENTION SPOILERS IN THE PROS AND CONS.  Got lucky and got it on  {LINK REMOVED}  cdkeys.com  including all the DLC for $18. Better than what Steam Summer Sale is offering. Anyways! The game is great. Runs great and played it all the way with all the graphics cranked up on ultra and maybe had some frame rate dips here and there but nothing worth complaining about since I am sure they're going to still be updating the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game! Glad i made the decision to buy this after I bought this a year ago on the PS4 since the PC Version had an abysmal launch (thank you WB). Story is great! If i had to stack the story up against the previous installments i would rate it my second favorite of the set. Definitely THE best Batman Experience you're probably going to get until the next game or that Arkham VR Game comes out (fingers crossed???).   Pros: -Sandbox and roaming the streets of Gotham with your Batmobile. -Dual takedowns. -Riddler Trophies are less of a pain and more fun to find. -Kevin Conroy voicing Batman. -the flying mechanics are the best in this franchise. -loving the variety in switching up your suits and putting them in the cutscenes. -love that I can dress up as the The Dark Knight Batsuit and drive the tumbler around (granted it was after I dealt with the entire militia before I could do that. DON'T DENY ME THIS! DAMN IT!)  Negatives: - Arkham Knights reveal was played out and kind of weak. Wish they would just called him the Red Hood. - Couldn't get rid of The Joker completely for the last one in this trilogy eh, Rocksteady? - Batmobile missions can get annoying at times. I just decided to focus on getting all that BS out of the way so that way I could focus on the other fun parts of the game after. But even then I was starting to feel the fatigue. - Couldn't give more dialog to the regular stooges on the streets for me to pumble? I do love hearing the same thing two minutes later after hearing it........ NOT!  Played the game on Ultra Settings all the way through  i7 4790k GTX 970 Windows 7 64bit 16GB RAM",

Driving the Batmobile will take some time , but it's controllable now for me. The only thing is I cannot turn on the Nvidia specific graphics bits... but still love it!!! Do have a go at my initial review, posted below.  Bought the game just yesterday, playing at Low Res on my GTX 960 2GB with 8GB Ram. The Low Res was default setting, didn't change it to high in fear of performance degradation. May be I'll try it later. NVidia effects are off too. So, far what I see is that the driving in Batmobile is bad, it's hard to control....and you cannot avoid it in certain points. Some stuttering happened, while driving the Batmobile, but nothing game-breaking. The low-res works in my small 14' Monitor, so no problem with that for now. FPS is locked at 30, may be I'll search in Google about the remedy,as I remember there are some commands for unlocking it. The action is good,as ever. Alover, it's a thumbs-up from me for now. I would suggest to buy the game at a sale, or from some other sites like ♥♥♥.  P.S.- I've played this for over 2 hours by now. Don't know why Steam shows 0.3 hours!!! May be I played offline mostly is the reason...",

Fine, I left if for a week or so. Let’s try again.... played another 2 hours or so, right call the Batmobile again. Cruising for a bruising,... then I did not see any tree, wall, building or car in front of me but the game crashed so hard, not even a window stating it crashed popped up. This happens totally randomly. Put the swear jar away (just in case) while playing this game.    September 4 Patch Update:  I really cannot comment anymore as I have upgraded my motherboard, CPU, RAM and PSU. I have tried the game before the patch, please note tried is just starting up the game to see if it runs, and it was running a lot smoother with the new hardware.  After the patch I was just mocking around for about 2 hours and it did not crash so far.   Game controller layout now display the XBone gamepad (thumbs up).   Even thought the FPS can be set to be maximum 90, mine stops at 60 FPS ?? It occasionally drops to 54 FPS.   I had one henchman that was stuck in a car doing the infinite fall/reset dance, bumping the car sorted that out  Unfortunately there is not a maybe button for recommending this game, and I still have to actually sit and play it (think I will start over).    October RE- Release!!!!  I haven't played for a while so let’s see what have changed... The batmobile's wheel bearings needs grease, it is jerking a lot. Guess I will wait for the next patch, I really do hope that there will be one....   July 13 (2016)  Almost a year later, the game runs a lot better with the occasional 'what PC do you have? Let me freeze it a bit' moments. Nothing a hard reset can not solve. If you have played the previous games, this is a must.

Now we get to the story, at best the story is a classic Batman story and at it's worst it's a predictable unengaging story. Overall this game gets a 7/10 for being an average game with an 'okay story' , I found the game play to be boring and uninspired.

But it's expensive. Without buying from a reseller (like I did), you'll have to pay 60€ to play the full game. Because yep, the DLCs are cool, but they're expensive. Plus, the devs are disappointing to say the least. They released this game full of bugs and DLCs, and decided after some time that Linux and macOS users wouldn't be able to play it. They don't deserve anyone's money.   TL;DR : Awesome game, not as bad as when it released, but the devs DO NOT deserve your money. Either get it for 1/4 of the full price, or crack it.   EDIT  I'm adding a few things, since I've had time to think about it, and my review almost only talked about performances and DLCs.  When I say 'crazy graphics', I mean it. I've played the Witcher 3 in ultra, with and without mods, and this game is, IMO, even better looking. It's above every single game I've ever played, besides Dying Light.  It's also a fun game. I spent around 24 hours on the campaign, doing every side quests (including the DLC quests). Then there is NG+, which makes the game much harder (and a bit more enjoyable). And there are the challenges. There were times I wanted to spend hours on a video game, and I did on Arkham Knight. There were times I wanted to play a dozen minutes while something was downloading, so I did the challenges. The gameplay is rewarding, and extremely fun. Yes, they do push their Batmobile down our throat some times, but I still found it very fun to play.  Some might disagree with me, but this game is the best Batman: Arkham game. The city is huge, and beautiful. Thank god there is a 'photo mode', because I had to take cinematic screenshots very often. The gameplay if faster than in the previous games of the serie. There are more combos, and the addition of environment takedowns. There are more types of enemies, and they won't be easy to take care of.  And it's like every other B:A game: It's epic.",

The graphics are gorgeous, the core gameplay is more of the same old good fun, and the Batmobile sections are a very good break from that which alleviates the slight repetitiveness of the previous Arkham games. Also, having both the Batmobile and the grappling hook boost available means traversing a larger world is not a problem. The story is a bit bland, true, but the gameplay and the feel of the world makes up for it, and the sheer amount of side missions and riddles provides plenty of good fun.",

While I haven't logged any hours on my profile, I played through on my relative's with 120% completion rate and unlocked all the endings. Batman Arkham Knight is a great game, when you peel back some of the annoying layers covering it; from the horrid PC release to the seemingly rushed release, this game is still comparable to the first two games (I don't believe Arkham Origins really counts) and is a great conclusion to the Arkham series. First, the good. The story; definitely, especially after having seen the animated series throughout and seeing how it came through to this end. The ending may confuse some people, but I think it was well done and quite satisfying. Moreover; the emotional beats this game hit compared to the others is worthy of praise. I was feeling very tense and emotional at key points during the story; the music definitely adds to this and is appreciated.  The cast of characters; with the Season of Infamy DLC, many villain arcs have come to a close and the quests were fun to play. The quest for Mr Freeze was especially heartwarming and one of my favourite sidequests. The other sidequests were... not so well done, but I'll get to that later. The combat and predator encounters are improved upon further. Throw counters and more special moves added to Batman's arsenal and actually become very useful; especially fear takedowns, which you'll need to use against the improved mooks. They actually go to every length possible to beat you with new tactics including vantage point mining, sentry guns, scanning drones, better awareness of grates, and buddying up with each other. This makes the predator encounters more dynamic and challenging without being too frustrating, given the wider options Batman has as well. Voice acting; as great as ever. And Mark Hamill's addition was great and appreciated. The visuals were definitely the best yet, but unfortunately require a decent computer to handle. Still, seeing Gotham in all its glory was breathtaking as you'll fly to the tops of huge towers and drive through vast plazas and streets; fully realising a big city like Gotham as the environment. Now for the bad parts. Unfortunately, the tracking of sidequests was handled poorly, as most are more often than not fetch quests for extra objectives that span throughout the entire game. These become an annoyance because you can't always complete a quest the first time you receive it; most just end up piling up and getting annoying as I want to finish them off early, but you almost never can. Finding these objectives can be equally frustrating as only solving Riddler challenges lets you get map trackers on them.  Speaking of; Riddler challenges were not enjoyable here. Despite having less challenges than Arkham City; each one was overall more annoying than challenging as often switches you step on give you no feedback on what has changed; leaving you running around more than you should to find what you're supposed to be doing. The riddles were worse. In the open city, it only gives you the general area of a revealed riddle. Now this is a problem as there are so many things of interest to look at (which would otherwise be a good thing) to be annoying distractions as you often have little idea of what you're looking for. It could be a small poster in a whole city block; or a distant object that might have nothing to do with the riddle you're solving. This could have been alleviated by giving the exact location of the riddle in the open city like it was in Arkham City. The Batmobile was kind of a mixed bag. At first, and especially throughout with car chases, using the Batmobile was refreshing and was always fun when chasing down mooks and APCs with tracking shots. However the tank battles got quite repetitive towards the end; not challenging enough or dynamic enough to keep my full attention for the whole thing. The more insulting thing about the Batmobile is that the majority of any boss battles are for the Batmobile. Disappointing, to say the least. Still, I enjoyed Arkham Knight very much and it's clear now how much work was put into this game. Rocksteady still did a great job and I'm surprised by how hard many reviewers are being. Probably to do with the shoddy release, but this is a great conclusion and worth getting once you can get past the release problems and somewhat frustrating riddler crap (I had to resort to looking things up online). Thank you, Rocksteady. ",

As the final game in the series it is pretty decent, but certainly not (in my opinion) the best in the franchise. It does nothing groundbreaking or original in terms of the Arkham series.

            "review_text": "Batman Arkham Knight is the final game in the Arkham trilogy. It has a new large map with upgraded graphics and the batmobile.   The Plot  I will be talking about events which happened in previous Arkham Games so im going to write this in a way thats assuming you've played them. The main story is probably the best out of the Arkham games. It is no longer set in mainland Gotham but on the islands on the edge of Gotham. Scarecrow is the main villian and he just threatened the entire population of Gotham with his fear toxin. Everyone is evacuated and coincedentally, the story is set on Hallowe'en. The only people left behind are those who enjoy violence and terror. Scarecrow has hired a whole Militia run by an engima known as 'The Arkham Knight'. Very liitle is known about him and he has a very strong grudge against Batman. There are also other people who are interested in taking down the Bat. This includes Two-Face, Penguin, Riddler and more. Playing as Batman(Obviously) you must takedown Scarecrow and the Knight. In Arkham City, when Joker dies, Batman becomes guilt ridden and believes he is responsible for his death. Joker always said that Batman was his equal, that he had the mind of a killer like him, that they are both the way they are becuase of 'Them'. This is Batman biggest fear: Turning into Joker. Due to this, Joker hops into dialogue frequently, talking to Bruce. This is a great feature, I was worried there wasn't going to be anymore Mark Hamill. It has alot of side missions with alot of available DLCs. However, in order to unlock the games full ending you must complete EVERY sidemission which means you have to complete EVERY RIddler challenge. After over 100hrs, i still have not gotten everything as it is too long and boring. In Arkham City I actually enjoyed collecting the Trophies because the tasks were actually interesting.  Gameplay The gameplay is great, as you can tell by my playtime. It keeps the same freeflow combat as before and the AI(Enemies) has been improved. The counters are no longer delayed and the combat flows so much better. There are new combo takedowns and new enemies. These enemies include medics who can revive neutralized opponents, and Martial Artisits who have very complex move patterns. The biggest upgrade is the Batmobile. You're going to end up having a love/hate relationship with the Batmobile. Let me first explain what it does. It has a 60mm cannon and a machine gun. It also has a missile barrage, an emp shock and a virus to stop drones. The new UI includes new WayneTech upgardes for the batmobile which will enhance it in combat. The batmobile is very entertaing at the start of the game but then it gets overused. The game forces you to use it and it becomes a very tedious chore.   Performance At its launch.... Im sure you know about those days. But now most bugs have been patched and the game runs perfectly. It really eats away at your RAM so I suggest using a memory cleaner if you have below 8GB RAM. The graphics are really good, no jagged edges or bad lighting and smooth animations, so... You're going to need a good GPU. I'd say 2GB minimum which will only support lowest settings. 4GB for 30-50fps on High settings and for optimal performance use a 6GB GPU which will get you 90 fps or even 120(You can change the Max Fps in Bmsetting.ini file. The directory is ProgramfilesX86/Steam/steamapps/common/BatmanArkhamKnight/Bmgame/) You're also going to need a good CPU, Id say and Intel core i5 2500 3.3Ghz or an AMD equivalent. Match this criteria and you're good to go.  Overall  It has a great dark story, unique combat and beautiful visuals. A great way to finish the Arkham series which has a bitter-sweet ending. Get it on sale and savour every moment of gameplay. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great story or a Die-Hard Batman fan. ",

            "review_text": "After avoiding this game like the plague because of bad reviews for the PC version I caught it on sale. I went ahead and bought it. And the season pass. It's late, it means I get it all. I haven't been dissapointed by it. And also that it has had time to be updated. I'm an early adopter of lot's of things, games are usually not on that list. It has the same feel as the other games in this run. The art is good, the gameplay is what you'd expect out of a somewhat sandbox game. If you are the type of person who wants completion... it's that kind of game. The story runs flat in a few spots, but so did the other games in some degree or another.   On the art and graphics I give it an 8.5 out of 10. It's dark and the rain looks good. I just recently got my hands on a new i5 mid-to-upper processor and GTX 970. I get to run it full on at 1080 and it looks good at 60-75fps. The usual wear and tear on the character model through the game is there and unique to this game. The new suit is nice. The design of the batmobile is rugged and tough feeling. Hands down the DLC for the Mad Hatter is the best art style I've seen in a while... and after just 14 hours and around 37% completion... yeah, it's pretty.  On the gameplay I give it 9 out of 10. It has the same feel as the other large scale Batman games in the run. There are things to do but the random 'I'm gonna go fight a group of people at random' feels diminished because of the batmobile's toughness. There are though plenty of good fights in the main gameplay and the big ol' VR missions section if that's what ya want. The DLC adds a bit of extras but it's not a whole lot. Just enough to round out the game, but I'm not even at 40 percent yet. The riddler challenges are definitely hit or miss as always. They do make you think about it, and much like the others those reflexes and repitition are gonna be there. The batmobile in general has changed the landscape of this game series. The 'tank mode' makes it feel much better in terms of control for a vehicle but it can be a bit off-putting in the beginning. Even after 14 hours I still hit the left trigger for the brake instead of the x button in 'pursuit mode'. I am learning game design and programming and I honestly couldn't suggest a better control scheme, so it's just one of those things. A few new surprises in the gadgets.   On the tech side I give it a 6 out of 10. Sorry the early adopters suffered, and even I ran into some issues this late on. It would crash before launch. And I do mean I got a splash screen and then a crash. No fix the resolution pre-game menus... just a crash. I think mine was the DX installers or something that I usually see before every new Steam install that were missing. Luckily I fix PC's for side cash and managed to get it fixed in under 20 minutes after 3 out of 4 methods. For the non-technical PC gamers I'm sure this is still a problem. Search the Steam forums for a couple of good tips if it happens to you. This is the exact reason I waited to purchase this game. (as in you didn't get good mark up on the sell because I will not pay full price for buggy software). PC hardware is getting pretty standard and these are near unforgivable issues. I expected better after this long. A lot of new games suffer nowadays at launch and it's not acceptable. Once it was up and running though... not a crash to be seen except while attempting to allow background downloads while playing. Framerate suffered horribly for my next game greed while wanting to play some Batman.  In summary, it's like the others. Fans of this series will likely be pleased by the 'back to it' feel of Arkham Knight if the game runs 'out of the box', and will enjoy it as much if not more than other games. If you have the hardware to run it full tilt it will look good if not a bit 'shiny' due to the shaders. But most modern games have that. It's a button mashing good time in fights and there are things to do and it still breaks patterns now and then. If you just want a story it may let you down (I like it), but if you want that 100% it will make you try for it and you will get your dollars worth... race what is basically a tank through a shifting maze under a timer and you will have to try at it more than once but not 20 times and most times not more than 5 times on some of the harder puzzles. I'll admit that I'm impressed by a good bit of this game and the difficulty feels about right so far. The amount of dialogue and random pop up remakrs make this game better overall if you take the time to explore and press A alot. I don't regret waiting for it but would have been let down if I bought this early with all the fixings and had to deal with the tech issues more than I did.",

It's not my favourite (Asylum stil holds that due to atmosphere) and it's not my least favourite (City broke flow way too often). People didn't like the inclusion of the batmobile, but for me it felt like a logical progression. Asylum was all about atmosphere and sneaky stealth. City took what was great and built and adapted it, adding many new things, but for me felt devoid of heading, other than the ending to create Knight. Origins is the black sheep but my second favourite, mixing elements of Asylum and City and felt like what City should have been. Knight again took what was before and expanded on it, making it feel so different. gone was the sneaky stealth and instead we have fast action and brutal beatdowns, batman almost falling off the cliff to go darkside (or should that be Darkseid &gt;.&lt;).  Preordered it, played it from day 1, didn't return/refund it because...I had no problems. The only thing I can think of as to why i had zero problems is because i have 32gb of RAM (don't ask). As a standalone game it is still great, but becomes so much more when you look at the previous games, not just what happened in the story, but how it was acheived and the evolution of the series by rocksteady.",

The sheer volume of quests and tasks gives alot of gameplay. The Scarecrow looks awesome and is the best depiction of him yet. Wish he was that fearsome in the movies. Riddler was a bit of a dissapointment since he iconically is dressed well and takes pride in his appearance but in this game looks bad. Since there is only so many times you can redo the same game I really hope Rocksteady expands into other DC heroes.

Talking from a PC gamer standpoint, the operability is disappointing. True, you *can* run it, and I didn't really complain with my ability to do so, but for the average gamer, I cannot recommend you buy it. There's a lot of intuitive bugs here. However, the fighting mechanics are in their prime here. I think I had the most fun in the challenge room. But there's only a handful of maps, so that was a bummer. The car was more annoying, by 3 hours in, than cool. SPOILER:    I actually was relieved when they blow up the car, but then it comes back...    So on gameplay, it gets a big 'meh' which is not really enough to recommend a purchase.  STORY: Horse crap. I'm not gonna lie, I really did not like the story. Lots of moving parts and no real enjoyable substance. It was more frustrating than interesting. You know in Arkham City when    Ra's al-Ghul is destroying the city with the Tyger helicoptors?    Yeah, there's nothing emotionally comparable to that here. Lots of homages to Batman comics, movies, and the game series, as well as several    BLATANTLY STOLEN COMIC BOOK PLOTS    but overall, it still gets a 'no' from me. The only wonderful moment was the return of the sweet serenading of Mark Hamill. That was really the only positive to my three-night binge of Batman. Maybe I was just so shocked with the idiocy of the story that I thought less of it, so I might give it another go later on, but I would definitely say it is sub-par when comparing it to its older brothers.  CONCLUSION: Arkham Knight? No. If you're a completist, I guess? But you probably would have this game anyway. If you're starting new, stick to Arkham Asylum, City, or if you need better graphics, Origins. All are solid games and have merits in their own respect. The only reason you might *like* this game is if you genuinely enjoy the source material (not my favourite stories, frankly), and you want to be the most intensely violent Batman ever presented (including Batman v Superman). I bought it on sale and would in no way recommend buying it for any less. In the end, yeah, I guess I was entertained. I never thought I would say it, but Arkham Origins looks REALLY good right now.",

In spite of a ludicrous amount of riddler trophies strewn in almost every possible spot some insane developer thought would make a great challenge, this game otherwise performs wonderfully. Though it almost over performs. Between being able to take control of the batmobile, take down some rather obscure villains, tons of gadgets at your disposal and plenty of other activities aside from the already somewhat lengthy story main story and side stories availaible with the dlc... You see where I'm going with this? This game is great but it's a run on sentence. It wants to do so much but doesn't quite settle in everything it wants to do.  On the techinical side, I've heard this game was performing like a wet lump of rice on asphault in the middle of a busy highway. But it's been patched and such and for me, it performed like a charm. Being able to almost pump all the graphics settings in the game, save for anti-aliasing and the highest possible texturing, this game looks beautiful. It's worth mentioning because of how good Arkham Knight looks. From it's opening scene do the developers showcase their abilities. As for combat, it plays very much like it's previous titles but finely polished. Even with the over abundance of gadgets it manages to find a smooth but tight place in every gamers buttocks without being painful to sit on.  The batmobile feels worked into the game on it's own right, some missions strictly requiring the batmobile are numerous, but never feel like their just showing it down your pie hole, screaming about how they put a vehicle in a Batman game. But it has it's uses and many of which feel organic to the game, discounting riddler trophies which are a pain like no other.  Pros: -Eye candy -Overall polished game mechanics over previous titles -Plenty to do with a variety of interesting side missions -Batmobile is implemented well -Good sized map  Cons: -Riddler trophies are ridiculous -Game doesn't feel suited for mouse &amp; keyboard, you may want a controller -The Riddler -The Riddler -The Riddler -Vehicle/tank combat feels janky -Game never feels like it knows what it wants to do -Un-necessary amounts of collectables  I really and truly enjoyed this game and for the price, it's an okay purchase if your computer can handle it, as there were a few scenes here and there that really played with the frames, but few enough to not be an issue. I did have a few crash to desktops with no error message which I found was gpu overheating on this game. I set my fan curve to cool at a lower temp and zero ctds after ten hours. I'll put my pc specs below for comparison.  MSI MS-7850 Intel Core i5-4670k CPU 3.40GHz (4CPUs) this game was played @ 3.8GHz 12288MB RAM (12GB RAM) EVGA Nvidida GeForce GTX 960 4GB ftw edition",

Only when the game and the season pass were offered at 75% discount that I decided to finally get into the fray. . . and it has been a wonderful ride. While my 2GB GPU can only run the game on low textures, the game looks beautiful nonetheless.  I set the maximum fps to 30 to avoid heating my GPU too much for prolonged period of time while playing the game and I've found no reason to dislike the 30 fps cap that if you like, can be set to 60 fps. The game feels very fluid at 30 fps without any noticable drop in framerate even while playing the Batmobile.  The Arkham City looks stunning although still devoid of citizens due to a general evacuation as the story is told.  I don't hate the Batmobile play much although I could see issue arising from too many repititive tank battles in the Batmobile. Aside from that Batman feels very overpowered in person and more so with the Batmobile, it's a lot of fun driving in the Batmobile and playing Batman in person. What a hero.  If this game is offered with 75% discount rate and you have mid range PC with at least 2GB VRAM and 12 GB of RAM you owe yourself to play the game if you are a fan of Batman.",

Game is lengthy and full of content - I haven't had a look at any DLC yet. Some of the side content (riddler car stuff specifically) feels a bit too much. The batmobile is frustrating to control at times because of the control scheme (I'm using an Xbox One controller for Windows) and it makes some of the chase sequences feel chaotic instead of intense because you can't always guarantee how the vehicle will control - which could just be me struggling with using x to brake/reverse instead of the left trigger (which switches to target/tank mode).  But the rest of the game is that classic Arkham gameply. So I'd definitely recommend picking it up on sale.",

            "review_text": "Definitely worth downloading the 39 gigabytes of data. Arkham Knight is currently going for $9.86 and it is definitely worth it. Honestly, I thought that I wouldn't get much of it since the game's story is all over Youtube. However, I am glad to say that it is still worth it.   There isn't a need for me to reintroduce Batman. So, I'll skip that part.This is basically an upgrade of the Arkham series. It is a pity that Batman has to retire at the end as this will mean the end of the Arkham series. With Joker dead and no new villain to kill, the next escalation may mean the Justice League and Superman, which will totally derail the whole game.  Conclusion, play this game. You will definitely enjoy the cinematography and gameplay.   PROS  1. The Batmobile/Battank I loved it. It reminded me of Transformers : War on Cybertron but it's still great. The combat is so fun. While the mechanics are probably copied from somewhere else, it is still a treat.  2. Visual Spectacle It is amazing. Everything looks so real. E.g. The sloshing waves hitting against the pier,   3. Auto-Saving Why can't all games just auto-save so I don't have to do it? Thanks for coding this in devs.  4. AR Tutorials Beautifully done. It gives experienced players the option of choosing to forego the tutorial while creating a beautiful way of training new players. It also rewards players but giving them Wayne Upgrade points if you complete the tutorial.   5. Detective Mode Always great to have. It gives you hidden information and gives you a small surprise whenever you use it. Can't wait for the crime scene investigation.  6. Vehicle Takedowns It feels like Burnout, where you smash cars and time dilates. It's pretty good actually.  7. Auto-quest-mapping with the arrows I loved it. I know where to go when I'm driving.  8. Interactive Displays Kudos for the extra effort into creating displays for all the items in the GCPD item room. E.g. Talia Al Ghul's sword and the emotional display by Batman   CONS  1. The Batmobile's Steering Horrendous. It spins out of control so often.  2. The Batmobile's Weight Seriously?! It flips like a cardboard car. If it's a tank, it should have some weight for the realism. I shouldn't have to flip the Batmobile like in Halo. It totally destroys the immersion.  3. Killing the Thugs I get a feeling that this departs from the original story where Batman never kills. I think I've run over and shot multiple thugs. If you're going to kill one, then kill them all.  4. Line Launcher Honestly, I find it a very silly and extremely rarely used piece of equipment. The line launcher is basically a horizontal grappling hook for creating wirelines in the middle of nowhere. It is extremely situational. It would be better to remove it and allow players to scroll through their inventory faster.  5. Riddler Race Course If you fail, you still have to complete the lap manually. Can't you just restart from the start as an option?  6. Too Many Gadgets to Scroll Through 11 different slots? That's way to many to press.  7. Riddler Quests I don't enjoy Riddler Quests at all. While they are puzzles, it is extremely tedious to find an informant, mark the puzzle, travel to the puzzle location and solve it. The travelling is the main pain in the ♥♥♥.   SUGGESTIONS  1. Zooming with the Batmobile In order to go into combat mode, you have to waste 1 player button which is the Right Click. For such a high-tech vehicle, it would be great if you could zoom in and fire pinpoint sniper fire. Players love sniper missions, just look at Hitman Absolution. You can use the Z key but it's intuitive, usually you zoom with the RC.  2. Take it Underwater You have land, you have air, why not the sea?  3. Multi-Targetting It's already done with the missile barrage. Why not use it for the thugs? Like Riot Control?  4. No Line Of Sight Attacks Firing a missile around the corner without seeing your enemy. Lobbing a projectile over a building. You can combine this with Suggestion 3.  5. More Hostage Scenarios This will be the Hard difficulty missions. How do you plan a simultaneous assault without sacrificing the hostages? It's like a real-life Spec Ops mission where the lives of the hostages are factored into the equation. You could even add Robin in. It's a good way to show how Batman is the good guy after driving around Gotham like a lunatic.  6. Sewer Roads As part of the Batman story, you could allow Batman to use Wayne Entreprises to dig a series of hidden service tunnels that go deep under the city. This will Batman's secret method of getting around Gotham without getting detected. It's even lower than the subway. Since Engima's already dug a race track. How about using it?  7. Fight a Spider Tank and A Mega Tank I want to fight a Spider Tank. The one from GTA using the Batmobile. I want to fight a Behemoth Tank that's huge and crushes everything. It's invulnerable except for a special occassion when it's defenses are down.  I want to fight more helicopters, not just once in a boss fight.  8. Remove the aiming of the Disruptor It destroys the fantasy of Batman's gadgets when you see him aim down a rifle sight. It doesn't fit into the theme.  9. Knock out gas/Knock out darts Something similar to Assassin's Creed's blowdarts. It fits his theme perfectly.  10. Lex Luthor I am actually pretty psyched to see Lex Luthor appear as a villain in the next series. He is definitely deserving. Since Lex doesn't have super powers (unlike Superman), it would actually be a fair fight.  11. Stealth Removal / From the Shadows Batman seems to be kind of sloppy in Arkham Knight. In the shows, Batman works from the shadows. You pick the soldiers off 1 at a time. Since you have grates, you can stuff the bodies into the grates, hang them from the roof, stuff them in a crate or rope them to a pole.  12. Turn Off The Lights Knock out the lightbulbs and lamps and make Batman's enemies confused. Then take out your enemies in the dark. If they are in the dark, the lower-ranked thugs will become 'fearful' and you can take them out quickly and instantly. Later levels will involve thugs using flars and attaching flashlights. You could even jump scare a thug and take him out the moment he strikes a flare.   13. The Batwing I want to see a Batwing and aerial fighter combat. I want to see loop-the-loops and maybe a space battle. It could be a special event where you start off with the Batwing and next thing you know you're in space. You could consult aerospace engineers. That scene could later link/continue onto the Justice League's space station.  14. The Batsub I also want a Batsub to traverse the underwater environment. This is perfect environment to fight Killer Croc in.  15. Stop a Shootout GCPD is fighting a heavily armed militia and they are out gunned. Then, in comes Batman to even the odds. Out gunned as in the thugs have missile launchers, miniguns and high-powered sniper rifles.  16. Online Multiplayer / Co-op An interesting method to test the number of players who are willing to play co-op missions. Everyone can't be Batman but you could do a co-op mode where 1 guy is Nightwing, 1 girl is Catwoman and 1 guy is Batman. Online tank battles with PvP. It would be awesome.  17. Rail Sliding Just like Tony Hawk. Why can't Batman rail slide?  18. Add Value to your choices This game is purely linear. There is no dilemma or impact from doing 1 choice or the other. A simple suggestion would be to up the diffculty for missions you choose to delay. Delay as in order of completion, not time dependent. If you do mission A first, mission B gets harder. If you do mission B first, mission A gets harder.  19. Simplify the Choices Disruptor + Remote Electrical Charge  Batarang + Remote Batarang Remote Hacking Device + Voice Synthesizer  20. Compiling all the Riddler Quest into the Riddler Tower For thematic purposes, 1 skysraper building hijacked by the Riddler. Every floor is a different puzzle. No travel.",
