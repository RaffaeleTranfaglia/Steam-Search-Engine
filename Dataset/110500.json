            "review_text": "Data Jammers: FastForward is a computer themed arcade style game where the player controls a 'Data D.O.O.D' though a racetrack full of hazards and opponent in order to hack into 'Ouroboros' Watching this video, the game seemed fun and something about it reminded me of playing arcade games when I was young. Despite wanting to like this game, I cannot recommend it.   Like many computer themed game, this game has nothing to do with actual computers and is only there to facilitate a convenient Tron-like art style. Zipping along the racetrack as such is fun at first but quickly loses it's luster and ultimately feels a bit like a gimmick. Where this game fails is the fact that it's procedurally generated and that it throws everything at you. As a result playing this game is a bit of a chaotic mess which puts you in situations that often feel unfair. I feel this game could have been better with intentionally designed challenges instead of throwing the player into a sloppy mess.   The game does support USB controllers fairly well. If you're looking for a challenging (and sometimes unfair) arcade game that you can play with a USB controller than this might be a good title but don't expect too much.  Score: 5.5/10 ",
