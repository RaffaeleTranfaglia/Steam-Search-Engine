First of all, the game has insane graphics for it's time, it looks about as good as the current COD (not as good as battlefield 1 maybe, but close).   Secondly, there's always servers with lots of people on them so multiplayer is insanely fun.  Now let's get into the campaign, The story is very deep and well formatted. You feel very involved in the story.  In conclusion. I would recommend this game to anybody who loves fps games.",

I can't believe when I can see an ugly alien from outerspace holding Thompson Sub-Machinegun aka Tommy Gun that became popular in our culture as mafia weapon. IMHO, Alien Mafia is the better title than this one.  In gameplay, player got a lot trouble like permanently jammed weapon that can't shoot anymore (read: terrible bug) so the other option is runaway from ugly alien mafia until quit the game or kill yourself and respawn or try to blame owned keyboard that not responsive or blame the 'R' key that cannot work. Very well made broken product. At last it is the one and only game to shoot &amp; kill Alien Mafia, there is no other game like this. If you want killing those Alien Mafia with permanently jammed weapon, this game is for you. But for me, it is a Big naah .... even I get it for free.",
