I recommend the game to anyone who is a gamer.  Positives about the game...  - You can do whatever you want, build a tower out of mushrooms, no one is gonna stop you! Fly to the moon you say? Well do that, as I said NO ONE IS STOPING YOU :D  - You can collect crystals, floraforms, budssuits. It's simply awesome.  - You can interact with objects such as, stones, floraforms, and more.  - It's a fun 3d platformer with a little challenge built into it.   Sorry the gaame also has negatives :( Negatives...  - Game lags even if you have a good computer, especially when falling.  - Sometimes floraform seeds dont grow even when touchng ground/water. And yes I know certain floraforms grow on certain grounds.  - This is a minor one. Sometimes you drown to quickly.  - Sometimes it can be hard to find the challenges just because they dont have a radar. I know you can use the sattelite thing to find them. It was just really hard to find the last one for me. Maybe next game you can choose what to radar?  Ok thats it, hope you enjoyed my thoughts about the game. Also don't think I dislike the game because I don't i loved it... Also developers if you see this review please take note of it, use the notes that I gave you.",

            "review_text": "Perfect, top quality sequel. It's seldom said, but the sequel improves upon all the aspects of the previous game while still preserving the gameplay of the previous game.  To put it bluntly, Grow Up is an exploration game where you wander around a big planet (that actually works like a planet, surprisingly) and collect stuff. Sounds pretty basic, but the fun is in the journey, not the destination. Getting around the planet, exploring and collecting new items and abilities is the core of the game, and it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ goood sh!t. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ   The character you play as is procedurally animated, so that you wibble around the place like a ragdoll except with the control of an animated character. You can climb around the place using a pretty fun system. Your left and right mouse buttons control your left and right hands. Hold them down, and that hand will grab. You can mix that together to climb up ANY surface in the game, at all.  The graphics are pretty simplistic (although the game still runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ apparently) although the lighting really kicks it up a notch.  Feast your eyes  [i.imgur.com]   The game is pretty short. I went and 100%'d it in about two days.  Soundtrack's good. There's a load of post-game stuff, and an annoying robot that keeps telling you to do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you've already done.  All in all, it's miles better than Grow Home and feels really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' comfy.",

From other reviews I had thought this was a much larger game, not just a little bigger.  Its not as reliant on the carpal tunnel inducing climbing mechanic as Grow Home, you quickly get better modes of movement and that is very welcome. But you do get overpowered very fast and really don't need to make use of the cool plants or your ability to grow those plants.  Where it falls down is the POD challenges which are not necessary and until you have all your powerups many are impossilbe. They also feel like tacked on typical platformer crap, got bored of them after doing 5 and stopped. Also once you build the ship there isn't any reason to keep exploring except to get more crystals, but you are already powered up and the goal is done so that is just tedious.  The necessary parts of the game are a lot of fun and feel very unique, its a shame they tacked on the tedious bits just to make the game feel bigger or longer when they should have just made the main quest longer.  Still a lot of fun for 5 bucks at sale time.",
