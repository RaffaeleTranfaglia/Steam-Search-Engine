            "review_text": "Tons of fun, and still runs great on Win 7 x64. Max resolution is kind of low, but overall graphics are still running fine.  Comanche 4 is an enjoyable mix of fun and realism - realism to an extent that you can jump in, figure things out quickly, then play a few missions. There is no flight model, so there's really no steep learning curve. The only thing a player needs to practice is detecting anti-air and learning how to use cover to engage.   I miss Novalogic, and I wish they would give some of these older games some TL&amp;C. Comanche 4, along with Armored Fist are gem's of the past - unfortunately Armored Fist doesnt run - but bring back some great nostaglia.",

            "review_text": "I really enjoyed this game from my youth, and when i got it i was happy to relive the experience, and it was not very great. There is only one problem i have with the game, and it's a big one. I have a modest computer which should have no trouble running a game this old, and yet every 5-10 seconds there would be a frame rate stutter that would last around a second. Very annoying, and i do not know if it is my computer's problem or wether it is just not optimized... or something like that.  Actually there was one thing i didn't like about the gameplay. I get it, Comanche is a fast stealth helicopter with powerful weapons, and the game is not supposed to be very easy, but alot of the enemies (in later missions) all have these super powerful anti air missiles that takes just 3 seconds to lock onto you and not even the Flares will save you. but actually this is probably just my problem for wanting to go in guns blazing vs modern military force because it worked so well against Pirates with terrible weapons.",

Easy controls, fun to fly around and destroy everything, can even turn on your team if you want to. Graphics aren't the greatest but what do you expect from a game this old? Classic. Great game.",
