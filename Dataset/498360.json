            "review_text": "  Puzzle Nebula is a nice little puzzle game, that you can easily enjoy in small bursts.  The difficulty curve of the levels starts out with being almost laughably easy, but as you approach the mid-30s it'll have introduced plenty of elements that'll require you to actually think about where you move your little piece of space junk.  For those with collector's mentalities out there, the game also has some datalogs that you find on some of the stages, all of which ultimately combine to a fun little story. Nothing mind-blowing, but certainly not terrible either.  All in all, if you're looking for something that you don't have sit with for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time, Puzzle Nebula is worth a try. ",
