            "review_text": "Now that i have reached 100 hours in Hoi4 i think its time to set right what so many steam 'reviewers' and mainly QQers have done wrong.  So, join me in this journey as i go through everything the game is offering and taking it apart, giving you an actual idea of what the game is about instead of reading a review of ppl with about 20 to 10 hrs gametime or less - because in this game it actually makes a difference.   Disclaimers: 0.) Havent done the tutorial since i come from Hoi3 and didnt think i needed it. Was right, but i hear its not really helpful for newbies tho :/ 0.1) very hard for me to stay in the review corner and not turn this into a guide, so if you feel this explains too much, let me know.  Table of Contents:  1.) UI, its what you usually see first when you launch your first match, pros and cons. 2.) National politics tab, where you set Bonuses to your Nation, and go down the focus tree. 3.) Research, obviously where you get Nukes and V2´s. 4.) Diplomacy, or Public relations as i like to call it. 5.) Trading, yeah have fun with that as germany -.- 6.) Construction, not to confuse with production, here you build factories, AAA, costal defences, and all the juicy stuff your provinces could ever need, even recources ;P 7.) Production, not to confuse for Construction, here you build tanks, aircraft, ships and infantry equipment. Everything a soldier could wish for. 8.) Recruting, this is where you actually train and deploy new units. 9.) Logistics, overview of what you have, need and produce. 10.) Gameplay, here i will talk about the actual gameplay and stuff that happens on the map. 12.) Overall Impression, final thoughts.    UI:   This is a combination of mixed feelings for me, because it throws new ppl into the cold water. Once you get your head around it, it is very intuitive and easy to understand and follow the developers logic with how and why they went with this. Tho i have to admit, my con in this is that the switching between the mapmodes in the bottom right corner (recources, resistance, supplies etc.) is a little bit enraging since the buttons are so genuisly tiny that you tend to hit the screens edge and end up in japan when youre fighting in the north see before you selected the supply mode. But i heard they are going to adress that in future patches (The way we know Paradox theyre likely to laugh diabolicly at that kind of misfortune as well...).    National Politics:  This is where you spend your political power on in the first 2 years of any game, you equip your nation with all sorts of bonuses by setting politicians or laws that reach into every aspect of the game, even combat.  For me, this was one of the easier features to understand and it is indeed very straight forward and self explanatory.  As well as that, you set national focuses wich bring you on the path to war and greater power, for the most part. Depending on your nation - Superpowers like russia USA, UK or germany get a specific one for themselves while minors like Spain, Nepal or Luxembourg have to share the same one - you have different objectives that you can choose to go for. For germany that would obviously be the annexation of austria and the chech part of chechoslovakia, or in the Russian tree you have a lot of 'SEND PEEPOL TO GULAG!'    Research:  Now we come to a little bit more juicy stuff. When it comes to research you get a metric button of choices at the start of a game and during earlygame, a lot of catching up during midgame, and a mixture of 'so what the ♥♥♥♥ am i going to do with myself now' and 'YAY' when you finished all your tech trees in late and endgame.  Overall the techs explain themselves very well and are for the time they are set in EXCLUDING THE MODERN TANKS (E-50, Challanger &amp; Co.) very well placed. By wich i mean it all makes sense. But you reach lategame tanks to quickly. In 60% of my matches as germany i could skip Panthers and Panzer 4´s and go straight for the E-50. Wich is brilliant btw.    Diplomacy:    Ahhh yes, the most useless thing in any hearts of Iron game because your Hitlerin and Blitzkriegin your way to World dominance anyway and you know you will :D  Im kidding... now with Hoi4 you can actually do stuff with it! Make USA into Nazi country and call themselves 'Free American Reich'? CHECK! Make france turn communist, leave the allies and join up with Russia in comintern? CHECK!  Wanna do cool stuff like that? Well here is where.  Also i like how war declerations are performed now, gives it a little more strategic and realistic feeling to have public denounciation of *coughdenmark* uhm i mean various countries going on before stepping on them *cough* it.    Trading:   Now, here are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of nations coming together. Germany´s lack of everthing, Uk´s Overflow in everything but steel. USA´s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amounts of Oil. This tab, including all the recources that the game has (i know this is not a guide but i think for ppl that want to buy the game by any chance would be helped if they knew this); Oil, Rubber, Tungsten, Steel, Aluminium and Chromium; is very well designed and intertwined with the rest of the game in my opinion. So far i couldnt find anything bad about it.    Construction:   Here, we start to get a little more strategic, Youll need Civillian factories to repair bomb, combat and resistance fighter damage, and to build new stuff like more factories, more factories or more factories. (In a way this is me both actually telling the truth and joking at the same time)   I have to be honest with you, you could go for nothing but factories but if you did that you wouldnt be very happy, yes a good amount of factories - military or civillian - is indeed neccessary but you need other stuff as well, your provincal anti air guns will be useless if you dont build radar and research good encryption, your trooops will run out of supplies when you fight without infrastructure in russia, etc. All that sort of stuff needs to be sorted or you will make it more difficult on yourself.    Production:   I really dont know what to to this. Whenever i meet someone new to Hoi4 and they run into Production, theyre always like, HELP!!!!!!!  And then it takes me 2 Minutes or less to explain what it what and they theyre saying, ah okay this is actually pretty easy...   Important to note here is that all the equipment you produce gets AUTOMATICLY transfered into eighter your divisions on the field, or if they are all fully equipped into storage. Production is 100% passive and in the background, if you produce everything you need then there is nothing you have to worry about from there on out. If Equipment is still missing build more. The Logistics tab helps a lot with that but were not quite there.  There is one little thing that i have to ad for a personal con, and thats when you open up the list of things you can open up a new line with, there should be an option for every vehicle to be turned off and on again so you dont have to see them. Because the longer a match gets, the more of a scrollfest it becomes. very annoing.     Recruiting:  Now here is where ppl get lost easily, because you dont only tell the game to recruit whats there, you also have to look at your division templates and change them to your needs. And you HAVE to do that. You can not expect to win against france if one of your division has 5k men full strength.   All in all i am pleased with how Paradox set this up, it is all very logical and easy once you understood it. Getting there is mostly the issue but when you buy a paradox game you sign up for this.    I will now have to stop because im running out of letters.............. NOT AMUSED   Well i guess you get the point i love the game and everyone should.   Goodbuy!",

            "review_text": "Unfortunately, as much as i like this game......and will continue to play it. I have to warn people that as of right now the game is broken in many fashion. Altought it may not appear to more ''casual'' eyes, the AI in the game is uterly flawed. Picking any nation in the world and steamrolling anyone is very easy. The AI is totally.....and i really mean TOTALLY clueless about what to do. I will change this for sure if they fix this zombie AI and i really hope they do.  Some examples.  -If you are playing germany, dont expect the AI to attack mainland Europe. It just cant make any sort of worthwhile naval invasion.  -The AI of EVERY nations feel compelled to send almost all their army in expeditionary forces across the world to fight useless war. Its very common to have millions of soldiers, whole armies, fighting for nothing in the sahara or in the Himalayas...and of course all the while they lack supplies and thousand die just because the AI dont care about supply.   -While the army of everyone is sailing uselessly accross the world for nothing they never escort their transport ship. Again the AI loose soldier and equipment.....for nothing.(The italian have a BAD habit of sending almost his whole army to north germany, embark in (aparently teleporting...or more realistically folded) boats, sail through the english channel, while the english kill them in drove of course. Then go all around africa to reach the utmost important and strategic country of ethiopia. EVERY GAME  - The AI is totally unable to use the army experience/template systems. This only weakens him even more as it cant field any kind of good units(template). also wasting precious experience points in dozens of template it wil NEVER recruit.   - The AI is unable to decide what to attack, defend or ignore. You can see germany conquering the russian and fighting well beyond moscow, all while the britsh and the USA will conquer europe without any resistance. Or the italian fighting desperatly for every inch of the precious sahara desert. While Italy is being invaded, they wont send any army to defend themselves.  - Its so funny. In one of my games the USSR invaded romania early, before I (as germany invaded france). Then instanly after Romania joined the allies. The war was of course won by Russia and romania became communist. But it didnt ended there the war now was beetween the Allies and the commintern. So the war migrated to the only border beetween the two. North india, it was so ridiculous every allies nation sended whole army to fight litterally in the himalayas...well almost XD, and of course with no supply every one lost tons of soldier. And before it even began the war was already won by the Axis(me). This suicide for what......romania...wich didnt even existed anymore at this point....so you see its kind of broken.  To me what is even more frustrating is that all these glaring and big problems passed the testing phase. Its shameful. Almost Rome 2 shameful..........",

The production system is simple yet elegant and offers a lot of choice on how your shape your nation, the focus trees allow you to customise how (a)historical you want to be and the first lot of hours in any playthrough are great fun.  Few problems : AI is a disaster at the moment and offers virtually no challenge. I'm sure this will be fixed in future patches but the low base set means it will probably never be great AI. The battle planner is also affected by the same issues.  Feedback is pretty terrible - I have no idea how much attrition is happening in battles, what my bombers are bombing, how my fighters are faring (except to see how many each side loses each day). Again something I'm hopeful of being fixed, but still a pain in the ♥♥♥♥.  Late game is generally a chore, and the allied AI floods the front lines with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unorganised peasant armies who can't push a front for ♥♥♥♥.  If you can overlook these, definitely worth a buy.",

            "review_text": "As much as I love the Hearts of Iron series and almost every Paradox game I cannot recommend this to anyone in its current state. The game compared to prior versions of Hearts of Iron, or many Paradox grand strategy games, has been simplifed to the point where it is no longer fun or interesting. It has none of the replayabily of other titles like Crusader Kings, EU, or Victoria 2. However, replayabilty is just one major problem among many.  The biggest problem is the AI, which is probably the worst I have ever seen in a game like this in ages. It cannot manage its own forces, build anything, and generally just spits out waves of infanty and fighters. The AI cannot handle what they want it to do, which includes basic production of war goods. This game was delayed for over a year and this is what they thought of as releasable, which is nothing more than a paid alpha.   While the AI is bad, the most damning thing is the design decisions made in this game. The UI is a mess, constantly clicking through multiple widows to seach for the most basic info. Just to find out the size of your army is hidden in a non-descript number behind a force summary. Information is hard to come by and often just never presented to you until after you notice a huge disaster.   This games economic content in its current state is a huge disaster of its own. It has none of the depth or fun of Darkest Hour, which game players extreme amounts of choices and options. Everything is based off of resources and basically two factory types: civilian and military. All of which the AI can't manange. There is no comprehensive diplomacy or espionage system, which I assume was but for a paid DLC later.   Ultimately, this game is a cash grab. Ton's of content missing and bad design decisions that they pass to the modding community to fix and add content for. Everything else will be behind pay walls of DLC which will undoubtably have packs for indvidual countries and content that was just considered part of the game in previous versions.",

            "review_text": "I'm a big fan of the series but they dumbed down almost every element of the game (compared to HOI 3&amp;2). This may makes the game more accessible but it ruins all of the joy and long term motivation of the game.  The new game should allways have more (and better working) features than the predecessor, not less!  Main Issues are: -Bad, very, very bad AI. How come the AI has become worse than in the previous games?! The Lines of AI-generals look like swiss cheese and as long as they feel superior in numbers they keep attacking in the most self-destructing ways, without any regard for there losses and the value of the gained position. And now you have to rely on this stupid AI, because micromanagment has become all messed up. -Same goes for diplomatic AI - when soviets can stroll trough axis territory (depsite beeing on the brink of war with them) and capture south africa from the allies you start wondering why they delayed this game for a year. How bad can it have been before? -No more support attacks, no more planed arrivals or sheduled attack times for multiple divisions. the manual stategic movement and shipment of troops is completly messed up. -The trading system is a warcrime! Why must i buy 8 pcs when i only need one? And why can't even isolated dictatorships decided what they want to export to the world market, and tho whom? What was wrong with the old trading system? -No more sending air or battleship support to a single important fight - now you have to order them to ridiculously big regions and loose all oversight.  -For ground forces you have no chance to count your losses and compare them to the losses of your enemies after a battle ends. Ever heard of the term 'war of attrition', Paradox? What happened to all the statisitcs you could get in the previous games? -The new map sure looks nice but without terrain and weather filters it is useless for placing and moving your troops, this takes the rest of joy out of micromanagment. -Missing or broken supply-system for fleets and air wings (fleets can move and fight for years despite beeing cut off from friendly harbours)  The few improvments: -the new production and equipment system (the only thing that became more complex compared to the older games) -they added peace conferences like in Europa Universalis -The Focus tree system is very helpfull in customising your nation -you can now stage armed coups in any other country  In Grand Strategy I do not need fancy toyplanes flying over my map - Give me a working AI!! I recomend you wait untill they fix this game - as allways - with their countless DLCs and then buy a hopefully playable gold-edition.  ",

AI is completely brain dead, the front system is a mess and it is actually harder to micromanage your troops compared to HOI3 (which is as must since leaving matters to the AI is a bigger source of frustration than actually managing stuff yourself).  The fact that this was released at this state really show how Paradox really cares about their costumers...  If there's another side of the story, they probably ended up with this broken game due to really bad design decisions and lacking implementation and even after delaying it, couldn't salvage the whole think, so decided to let it loose and hope people wouldn't complain too much...",

Apart from that, there is nothing in this game even remotley improved on, HOI3 Black Ice, is by far a more in depth and historically accurate game. The tech and gameplay have been dumbed down beyond description, as for air combat and the airforce system, it is soo messy and impractical, as well as ill-logical. The only improvement is introducing actual number of aircraft where as HOI3 was just aircraft wings. That is litreally the only improvement for air.  Naval combat could have been something amazing, the system is fine. although the balancing and accuracy is so un accurate, let alone sandbox, its just utterly unrealestic.   There is no micromanagement or immersion, and they have destroyed unit gameplay. where are the offices? why cant i assign them to individual regiments.   I love HOI and I really hope they take a step back from the dumbing gameplay down process. I strongly recommend buying HOI3 instead and installing the black ice mod.

The graphics are beautiful and the mechanics for ground combat seem to be there. As for Naval and air I'm uncertain but it might be OK as well. The game doesn't deserve the high ratings.

WTF ??? Oh ya this was while starting the game with history enabled... blinks...   I had my industry already 3/4 maxed out. War hadnt started and i had 75percant of my war factory possible done.  So i decided to attack poland. Ummm only a handfull of generals to choose from. No more worrying about which general to put where. Anyhow i set up the new battle planner and set my guys to attack and some do some dont some run back and forth alone the entire front lines some charge deep and get encircled... again WTF  If there are spys and such i cant find them. Prob woud suck anyhow. So no biggy :(   I like Hoi 3 as i can manage what i want where i want when i want. I have historical choices and happening around the world.   Just a huge dissappointment. Maybe in 6 months MAYBE it might be worth trying again. Im like talking dec 2016 or maybe jan 2017... Till then i dont know if ill play it again.   ",

            "review_text": "  Wonderful game and aguably the most solid title Paradox Interactive has ever launched.   Although it's being criticized, I feel that the switch to a more sandbox and  slightly  less railed WWII experience provides both historical grognards and world war microbebies a chance to live out their strategic dreams.  Come on, Neo-Ottoman Empire? That's friggin' awesome.  However, for all of the progress made in the field of accessibility and player inclusiveness we still have a ways to go. I say this for the thousands of people who are looking at HOI4 or have purchased HOI4 with no experience with Paradox grand strategy games. The Italy tutorial, while better than the one included in HOI3, lacks serious depth. If a newcomer were to hop in and play only the tutorial, then pick a major power, they would be screwed.  A very small nitpick and I understand that in a sense, I'm trying to have my cake and eat it too. You can't have grand strategy without complexity but newcomers could use a little more information! They shouldn't have to rely on the wiki for basic info about game mechanics. (Like how to use your navies, something completely absent from the tutorial. Or how to increase the reinforcement limit of airwings so you can continue to fill them with the planes you're producing, or how to manage occupied territories and switch occupation methods, etc...)  I feel that for the in-game tutorial to be successful the player should be left with enough information to hop into the game as a major power and have some idea of what they're doing. The fact that the tutorial doesn't cover all types of warfare, land, sea, and air is just inexcusable. Make Jake's entire job working on tutorials with that sweet sweet glaswegian ASMR voice of his.  Either way, I love this game and see myself playing it for a loooong time to come.",

Even as a sandbox experience I feel the game is lacking, many nations are not properly flushed out, the ai is rather dull, supply is ridiculous and never impacts your units, There is lack of a proper espionage system, and the battle planner, while a great idea, is awful to use.  They should return to a semi order of battle that allows you to draw individual arrows within a battle plan for your lower ranking generals under a field marshal commanding the entire army. You should also be able to draw battle lines and arrows through multiple countries even if you are not at war with all of them. The battle plan should be implemented in peices as you declare war on  other countries.  While I, myself played a decent amount of hoi 3, I realize that it too has many flaws. In summary, as a historical WW2 strategy game hoi largely fails, as a sandbox WW 2 game, it still fails in may areas that should have been addressed by the developer after two delays and over two years of development.

            "review_text": "Although spending many hours into this game, the core is obviously broken. The main concern here is the AI. The AI is really weak in fighting wars. Countries declare wars on other countries while losing an already existing war, which is absurd. Germany is the prime example of this. If you build a WW1-like front, the AI relentlessly attacks your frontlines, depleting its manpower entirely in the progress. This way, I've managed to destroy the Soviet Union in separate sessions with France, Italy and Germany, and with ease. Then there are also the ridiculous naval invasions performed by the AI. These invasions are numerous and meaningless, many times not even targetting an actual port, resulting in the slow but steady death of the divisions involved because you only have to surround them.   Next to these serious AI issues, the late-game suffers in terms of performance. When superpowers emerge and manage their hundreds of divisions, the game begins to lag. Playing on the highest speed will feel like playing on the lowest speed. I've never encountered a game that performed so badly on my PC, which more than manages itself with performance-based games, such as Arma III, and even other Paradox games.  Finally, the resource system doesn't make any sense. The army size does not affect the amount of resources used, it only targets the production of war material. So if you have a respectable size of industry, you can create a gazillion tank without having to suffer serious supply difficulties, or an impediment on your future production lines.   These are my main concerns, but I haven't listed them all. Nevertheless, I managed to have some fun with HoI4, but currently it is way to easy and unbalanced. I also wonder how the mentioned issues passed through beta-testing. I would suggest hiring new people or keep an closer eye on the actual test progress. Next to Stellaris, this is probably Paradox's worst product yet.",

Review and gameplay experince as below:  You play as one of the major nation leader before or during the WW2 period. Research new technologies for your military purposes.Build infrastructure for a better transportation and resources or equipments to your army divisions. Build Air base, Anti air and Radar station if you get paranoid with the neighbouring country. Position your army to the border as the German Reich is massing a total number of 60+ divisions at their border with the seemingly plan of invasion. But they signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, everything is going to be just fine.  Years passed, it is the year 1941, German Reich had already invaded and successfully capitulated both France and Poland with the help of other Axis members. Their Blitzkrieg tactics are going strong as they move their attention to the north and the middle east, Norway had requested help from the Allies against the mighty german wehrmacht naval invasion. Their best hope is Great Britain which are close to them. Heck, Mr.Churchill had already had enough problems to deal with the luftwaffe's strategic bombing. I don't think he can spare any troops to aid Norway. The capitulation of Norway is imminent. Meanwhile at the african theather, Benito Mussolini continues his territorial expansion.  Late 1942, At the other end of the world, Chinese United Front hold Japanese army into a stalemate situation.The japs realized Just when things couldn't get much worse, A newspaper report states that the United States of America controlled hawaiin island, a harbor named 'Pearl Harbor' were attacked by the Japanese Pacific Fleet and their carriers CAS accompanied by fighters.The United States of America decided to declare war on Japan. Did I mention that Japan is a member of Axis too? Great Britain sent a call to arms request to The United States of America seeking for war aid. They accepted the request. But it need a long time for the United States Army to reach Europe. Where the seas are littered with german U-Boats, capable of sinking ships with torpedoes while being technically invisible to the Allies. They must find a way to overcome it.  Mid 1943, German Reich controls most of mainland europe by this time. Should I start to intervene with this aggresive territorial expansion? perhaps, perhaps. As the Leader of Comintern, Spain are facing a threat of being invaded by the german reich. I wonder why the german reich didn't declare war on Spain, maybe it's because of Spain's faction, Comintern. The United States of America is still being held back by the german U-boats but their invasion is progressing quicker than I have expected, Perhaps this is the most suitable time to declare war on german reich and its allied countries with the reason 'Aggresive territorial expansion and poses a threat to the Soviet Union.(ME) Sure, why not? I have more than 1 Million manpower and more than enough army equipment to safely invade German Reich. Everything is going to turn out just fine.  1944, I have greatly underestimated the german army, I thought that I can blitzkrieg my way to Warsaw, and Berlin. Use their tactics against themselves. It'll be swift and simple, I expected little resistance on the polish border. The first few weeks of the invasion is going great with little and no resistance because of the inexperienced garrison army. But then, the much more experienced and better equipped german army clashes with the might of the Red Army. NO ONE WILL STOP THE RED ARMY ADVANCING. NO ONE. I was wrong, they didn't only stops the advance of my army, they also pushes back my army, back to my own border. Now I must confront the german army inside my own border. Just when the german army seek to advance into Moscow, Winter struck. Good news? No. The german army's momentum didn't stop for winter. They give no ♥♥♥♥s for winter. Just when they are about to march in heavily fortified and garrisonned Moscow. The United States army arrived at multiple port as their naval invasion target. At least that's what our code breakers told me. The German army had to draw some of their divisions back to the western front, leaving moscow with just a few dozens of divisions.

After patch 1.3, the AI is still not making any reasonable decisions.  German AI declares war (DOWs) on Poland and struggles to take it. It then DOWs the Low Countries and does not attack them. It may take Poland or may continue to struggle, and then decides to DOW Denmark and Norway. All this can happen before november 39. So germany fights on at least 3 fronts at the same time.  I have yet to see, with all the hours I played the game (mainly watching, not really playing), the German AI perform a single naval invasion on Norway, despite it always DOWing Norway. Oslo seems like the safest place to be in the whole war. Copenhagen too, it is not always captured. I have seen Denmark attacking into northern Germany instead.  The finns can capture an unguarded Leningrad, while the russians attack through western Finland...  The UK goes crazy and launches naval invasions in Italy, which is undefended, because all the italian troops are on the french border, or are sent to fight in the Netherlands, while the french are invading Milan. Rome usually falls in april-june 1940.   The game is not playable in its current state, and the responses from Paradox have been close to rude. They claim the AI cant be 'fixed', it can only be 'improved'. So it's a question of semantics for them.  They got one, I say one (1) guy working on the AI, and clearly he is not able. So the game is a disaster. And all the while this tragey unfolds they push out DLC with content that should have been in the game already, like the 'spearhead' (blitz) tactic. Or rather, the game should not have been released at all, because it isnt functional.  I would suggest any hardcore WW2 fan go check out the games published by Matrix games and/or Slytherin instead.

AI battle plan is easy to exploit and they too dumb to properly use planes. Axis AI love to throw a lot of thing in offensive without any determination like in one of my game. Italy start war with Greece early in 1938 and had been crushed easily by Allied force.  And I think the spying gameplay need some rework. It currently determined by how large encryption and decryption tech you have (it also tied to electronic computing machine) so it feel like intelligent is neglectgible.   Currently I suggest you to 1.Grab HoI3 with all expansion 2.Find mod named BlackIce, Historical Plausibility Project, Total Realism Project, or RPM tears of war. They can ber found in paradoxforum or moddb. 3.When you in game with these mod, set deployment to automatic. Turn on AI control and turn on 'enable AI reorganization' and you don't have to done tedious CoC in HoI3. Add air force and/or naval force for better result.

Also, Paradox DLC will almost always provide some free expansion content for the base game, usually fixes and improvements to the game and UI so, it is always worth revisiting their games after a few months.  Those who have played the previous three HOI games will find much changed in this fourth instalment (not going to get into whether they were good or bad). Some changes are likely done to improve the game's performance (simplified air combat, logistics, infrastructure, and unrest to name a few) which does result in the game running REALLY well for the first half of the game.  I do have my own complains about things like game balance and the AI being a huge derp most of the time. Yet I have confidence that paradox will tackle many of these issues over time as they have demonstrated... which will still take a couple of years. =P  I have patience and there is enough in the vanilla game with mods to keep me content.",

            "review_text": "Having spent over 100 hours on Hearts of Iron III, another few hundred most likely on the non-Steam edition I had before getting the complete pack, and other Paradox games on top of that, I'd call Hearts of Iron IV a big disappointment. The game has plenty of potential and good things in it, but all of it is let down by some flaws and lack of depth.  -Battle-planner. It's something you don't have to use, many surely point this out. But it gives you a slight edge with the plan bonus and most of all, does the work for you. But if you're intent on using -and- actually playing at the same time, it tends to override your commands and making delicate plans, which I've already made up in my mind, is rather hard to do and annoying. It's not a good addition at all, instead people should devise their own tactics and respond to the tactical situations as they develop, not letting the AI do it. That's a big con.  -Armies. Now they're big, one front might be led by a single field marshal who can command an unlimited amount of divisions, in addition to a few dedicated -armies- for armour and possibly other special troops you might have. Having individual division, corps, army, army group and theatre commanders brought much depth and detail into the game, letting your special elite divisions develop more (with their commander), rather than having it all bunched to a few guys whom you'll use throughout the game. The command structure is gone, and with it the old supply system. Now if you're lacking supplies, your front suddenly gets locked down instead of letting the situation worsen over time and develop. But oh wait, there's no fuel. Unlimited fuel for Finnish armour.  -Resources and tech. The last point over there brings us to this topic; now it's possible to get a very developed army with nuclear weapons and rockets whilst playing a third world country. Other than that, the research is very simple and ends in ~1945, thus not giving much advantages for the great powers which had their cutting edge tech (or loads of men to spare, hoh). You can also produce everything you desire whilst having no resources, albeit at a much slower rate. And you cannot stockpile your resources either, instead they'll have to be traded, in addition to your RAD troops deciding to call it a halt whilst they're needed to haul rubber from Indonesia.  -AI issues, which seem to concern many other people. The AI hasn't really offered much of a challenge, the only thing that held of my blitzkrieg for France was RAF's air superiority, whilst for Brazilian invasion of US it was the naval planning AI which deemed the empty Caribbean to be a threat and wholly unknown terra incognita for us. They might've (and surely have) fixed some of the issues, but at least they were still there the last time I played. No cunning invasions and flankings, mainly invasions into Germany's heartland with two divisions. Or not patrolling the seas at all.  -Focus tree. These have been made for few bigger nations, making the game less flavoured (kinda like with the few portraits instead of proper pictures they used in the previous Hearts of Iron games). They also delay and derail some historical gameplay, as the focuses might delay Barbarossa quite a bit, for example. And most of the time they don't work with other ideologies, in case you have a civil war or a coup.  Now, I've enjoyed some of the games I've had so far, quite a lot even. But all these issues and the fact that game is much more arcade-y and simplified simply drive me away from it, and thus I cannot recommend it to anyone interested in the usual Paradox stuff with steep learning curves and lots of detail.",

Ended up late in the night with 'WTF why is it so late already' :)  What I love:  - Trade is so much less annoying than in Hoi III - the focus tree - division planner - Spanish Civil war (was pretty tough) - Industrial part - Political Power thing - add supporters and stuff  Undecided:  - The Border / Plan klicky thing. I fail by fiddling around with that very often. Maybe I have to get used to it / maybe patches will improve this part ( If I attach an army to a border and add a Div. later - why do I have to order this division to this border?) - Tech trees. Still am undecided about that.  - In combat I am usually the more microing type. So I do not know if I like the battle plans yet (Missing the bonus). Maybe I will continue microing the Mobile Divs and leave the foot inf to the battle planner.  Not so good:  - AI did strange things in the civil war. (Just walked around long time with inf div, not doing anything. ) - if I change directions from an attack with a fully organized tank div. and run in an enemy Inf div with 5% Org that takes the province I am moving to a second before I arrive I really lose this tank Div as 'Overrun' ??? Seriously?  Summary:  Great game that makes already lots of fun. Will get better with the next few patches, I am sure. Also there will be more depth in future with DLC.  Edit: Update for the 1.2 patch:  - AI massively improved. Makes much less annoyung things like leaving borders completely open or stack 100 divisions in the Sahara. Still potential for improvement though. - I really got used to the battle planner, it also was improved in the last patch. I usually do plans for the line infantry and micro my mobile divisions to create pockets. Works out extremely well. - Pacific theatre interesting. - The navy has been rebalanced. Now pretty good. I still think sea lion is a tad too easy - Peace treaty conferences has been vastly improved due to feedback from the community and a modder (mod was integrated to the core game) - Ai does naval invasions   I am now at the point where I can really recommend this game. Devs are still working heavily on it and listen to the community on the PDX forums. Really looking forward to the first DLC  What can be still improved: - Ai (Japan got stuck yesterday on an island with no supply with 100 divs :) ) - Allies try naval invasions a tad too often. Especially into well defended areas, wasting manpower - Airwar UI is still clunky - Tech trees feel too simplified. Fleshing them out (like BICE) seems a good idea - some more techs, foci (focussses??) for the lategame. Also some more stuff to spend the political power on in late game.  - Maybe some intelligence options  Some of these might get adressed by the next updates - hopefully",

            "review_text": "250 hours. After 250 hours I am starting to feel as if I have seen and done it all.  Hearts of Iron IV is the ultimate historical grand strategical simulation. As a fan of the series I can easily say this game is a huge improvement over it's predecessors.  The new political system is glorious. It's not really that realistic but it is very fun. It's easy to set up a scenario where you can test what would happen if your chosen country had a different form of government.  The way production works is really fun and realistic. You now have to produce a huge array of different equipment. It works really well, and when 1944 hits you really feel like your divisions have upgraded. When maybe in 1939 you had 3 panzer divisions with a few light tanks, you have heavy and fast panzer divisions in 1944 which can be three times as strong and effective. As the war drags on the casualties begin to stack up and it really feels like the world is at total war. Some games just ended in total destruction for all sides, while others are over quicker when good decisions are made.  Warfare feels more epic than ever. Especially naval and air combat are understandable and meaningful now. Never have I felt such an epic feeling of sending the imperial fleet on a daring mission to destroy the carriers of the USA.   The only thing I can complain about is the AI. It's quite easy to beat. Actually, really easy. But if you want a challanginge arcade game you should play something more like an arcade shooter. Hearts of Iron IV is purely about having fun with history and exploring interesting concepts and ideas. That said there are some things I don't like. For example, the AI makes really bad decisions regarding technology and production. Don't try playing on historical mode, because it doesn't work unless you are germany, japan, the ussr or the usa.  The extended modding capability of this game is great. I am really looking forward to the big ww1 mod, kaiserraich and maybe some funky or funny mods (I have already seen Trump and Anime mods, which are really fun).  I have a lot more to say about this game but if you find WW2 interesting you probably already know to get this game. Buy it now - it's cheap and fun! ",

Not too many problems, except some lag in the end game after 1945. The AI need to be reworkes tho. The AI can do most thing good after the last patch, but they can still not defend themself or judge what decisions is good at what time. I don't like playing Italy, while at war with sovjet, and the allied because of Germany, and I still need to defend them from naval invasions. Also on the allied side I belive the AI need to learn that US should land-lease more weapons and stuff, in the same way they did in WW2. The doctrines should also be reworked, because SF and Mobile warfare is far better then mass mobilisation. How the AI control the skies also need to be reworked, because I don't understand why there should be 13 000 fighters over malta, while I have air superiority over London.

The AI, unmodded, just doesn't know what its doing.  For example, on Hearts of Iron 3 I played game after game as socialist republican Spain, trying to hold out as a bastion of communism in the West. I'd brace against the Pyrenees and wait for the might of the Wehrmacht to come down upon me. And come it would, and I'd have to do a fighting retreat from river to river and mountain to mountain, settling in the Southern cities, or in a final ring in the terrain around Madrid, to make a last stand. And I'd get crushed like a tin can, and it was glorious! And it should be hard like this, because its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ world war II, and a post-civil war Spain should not really be able to hold out against 1939 Nazi Germany.   In Hearts of Iron IV, I tried the same campaign with Spain, and found the game would let me annex Portugal first, then France, then fight both Germany and Italy, destroy Italy, punch up through the Dolomites and around from the low countries simultaneously, meet the Russians in Berlin, then rebase to Macau in China, launch an amphibious invasion of Japan, take Japan and end the war while launching a new war against the Allies, destroy the British and US navies around the Bay of Biscay, launch a three-pronged invasion of Britain against UK and Commonwealth troops, take out the UK, and take out the last few elite british divisions holed up in the Scottish mountains sometime in 1945.  I mean come on! Its supposed to be a renactment of the greatest conflict ever known, not stroll around the world swigging Sangria repainting everything your colour of choice. For reference, both games were normal difficulty. Sure, I could put the difficulty up, but the difference in AI capability is still astounding.

            "review_text": "Hearts of Iron 4 is an excellent strategy game. It does a good job of providing meaningful decisions in all aspects of the country (diplomacy, industry, research, military, etc.) without overwhelming you with options like its predecessor. The epidemic micromanagement has been replaced with useful tools such as the division templates. Army composition is important, so having the ability to quickly update entire forces is quite nice. Air combat and naval combat are also much more manageable now, with sea and air zones broken out into fairly large regions where you can assign missions to hundreds of ships and planes at a time to cover an area. (Fleets can be assigned to multiple regions, planes cannot, although they do seem to roam a bit outside of the region if they have the range and nothing to do inside.) Air superiority feels right in this game and has a strong effect and leaving your troops exposed to enemy close air support will almost always result in a loss. Supply makes much more sense than before and makes it so that the infrastructure damage to an area will slow down large armies quite a bit and weaken them significantly. Ports are often very important for getting supplies in and out of areas making naval superiority important as well. The damage caused to infrastructure by bombing can also be quite useful to stop the enemy's supply and destroying the factories keeping them equipped. Everything in this game just works together so well and feels like it has a purpose and that your actions actually change things without being too difficult to understand what is going on. I think this may be the best Paradox strategy yet, and definitely the one with the strongest and most complete gameplay at launch.",

The AI can get fairly wonky when not using historical focus mode, but in that mode it proceedes as it should. AI is capable of naval invasions for once, and observer mode reveals it is able to make invasion plans before actually declaring war. The move from stockpiled resources to 'maintence' resources is dissapointing, as is the continued use of mana, and while I hope someone can mod it back, i imagine it's fairly ingrained into the game's workings, and frankly, I'm tired of mods that make changes without heed of how an AI handles it. All in all I'd probably give HoI4 a 7 or 8, to DH's 9, but still a good entry nontheless.  If you actually liked playing OOB Spreadsheet simulator, you probably won't like this, but if you were a big fan of HoI2 and derivitives, it will fill the itch of needing soemthing a bit more micro heravy.  That said, it is lacking in certain areas, and if you are a DH vet, I'm not as sure I can justify making the leap just yet. But if you are new to the series, as I suspect most people reading steam reviews are, I still reccomend this version readily.",

Air numbers/kills need a bit of tweaking atm.  The AI is currently very lackluster, my biggest/only complaint with the game. I love how it makes naval invasions on different provinces, but it almost always loses the beachhead and allowing 5-10 division inland to be encircled and destroyed. I've also seen multiple times the AI not finishing off pockets of resistance for months.  Overall I'm really enjoying this game and look forward to a few hundred hours of great games.

My advice, just keep plugging away and when you 'get it' you will really love the game. The truth of the matter is that the game is highly addictive. I have had 5 nights were I have played well over 7 hours at a time. Everything becomes 'just one more battle then I will stop...'   As to the A.I. well yes, it's a bit wonky. Do things need to be patched? Definitely! Right now the game is fun. However, new to the series even I can see it's about 2-3 DLC expansions from being considered a great game.

It's much more intuitive than its predecessors and looks way better. The game's early gameplay starting at 1936 is the ost fun and diverse part of the game where anything could happen. This is where political manipulation and sublte build up is most useful. The game's midgame starts whenever world war 2 includes all of the major nations, so usually around 1942 but can vary depending on the early game. This is where the interezting and fancy techs really come into play and are fun. Land combat is incredibly intricate and intuitive and the AI is now a lot smarter. The enemy AI is a lot better after 1.2 update. the Naval and air combat are not all that well dsigned and haven't affected me too much if my land strategy is good. Having a good air force and navy certainly make combat easier but most industry will probably be devoted to land. That said, i still haven't explored naval and air combat that much and really want to put a focus on that in my future gameplays. The end game is where the game really slows down and gets tiring. This when you are mostly doing cleanup and have pretty much won world war 2 but have to get every minor country in the war against you to capitulate. You usually steamroll over the country but it still takes time to mke it happen. One big thing to remeber is to pay careful attention to world tension. Once it's above 20%, if you start a war you will usually trigger WW2 and you will be in that war until the ned of the game. IT's a great game with a lot of replay value and fun stuff to do. History obeys the player in HoI4 and you shape the world the way you want. This game will only get better with time as they add more dlc and updates to beef up more minor nations like they did with poland. GET THIS GAME! you will be glad you did.",

However, this game, not only has major flaws in its game systems, but also takes a ♥♥♥♥ on what you would call the grand strategy genre. I would call this more of a you-take-care-of-that-while-I-sit-here-and-do-nothing game. And for a game covering the most devastating conflict in human history, that is quite bad. If you're looking for an easy, forgiving, simplistic experience, then this is for you.

            "review_text": "Holy Guacamole. I love this game. But I also hate it. I will be reviewing Version 1.0 as I haven't had a chance to experience 1.1 yet.  PROS: -The post-war diplomacy is really cool. It's no longer just adding wargoals but rather a peace conference in which the victors decide who gets what territory. The nation with the most participation (captured important provinces, killed enemy troops, etc) goes first. Seriously, though, you don't just need to capture stuff to have high participation. As the UK I dominated with the Royal Air Force and I retained about 50% war participation (meaning I did half the heavy lifting). In contrast Germany had something like 90%.  -The new production thing works so well. It's a lot of fun. It's no longer just, 'Oh sweet I now have these cool new super lazer guns that can kill Nazi warlocks (just kidding about the lazer guns and Nazi warlocks), let me just upgrade everyone.' Pretty much, the system is like this: You're producing infantry equipment. Your factories can produce 160 infantry equipment per day (note this isn't just the guns). You research improved equipment. If you switch over you'll be producing something like 20 per day due to your factories not retaining as much efficiency.  So you need to decide. Do I start making the switch? And that's up to you! So you might slowly start transferring factories over to the new weapons systems depending on how much production is needed of the old equipment and whether or not you have a bunch of the old equipment stored away (there is a whole logistics screen which is super helpful with this).  -There's more fun with diplomacy. You can more easily stage a coup.  -Lend Lease makes a lot more sense than in HOI3. It's no longer the US giving factories but rather the US sending equipment. What's cool is that if you send a bunch of advanced armor to a nation that gets defeated, they will lose their equipment and suddenly your enemy is rolling around with that armor (as soon as they train their soldiers to use it).  -The air map is so much easier to use but far less detailed. This is both good and bad. No more specific time frames for missions.  -^To add. You also have a much clearer image of how many planes you have at your disposal. In HOI3 it was just '3 wings' and you'd be getting stacking penalties.   CONS:  -Fix the Navy screen please please please! It was so easy to divide and organize navies in HOI3. It was just a screen that popped up and two arrows which you could use to move ships from one list (Navy 1) to the other (Navy 2). Now, when you select a navy at port you see like two ships and it's just not as pleasant to organize them.  -The weather isn't as complex as in HOI3. Or maybe it is but you don't see it. You could track entire storm systems in HOI3 and predict when the best time to attack was. Now it just shows up. I don't know if I can anticipate a storm system but it just seems like some clouds move in and that's that.  -The AI digs so much. Basically they break through the enemy line and just keep moving even though the frontline is stuck far behind them. This is super annoying because they then pour troops into it and relax.  -I want the old NATO things with the HOI3 style where they just look like a stacked tower of squares. The new UI hides a lot of the borders when you zoom out. I.e. all the attacking counters and unit stacks just block everything. And yes, even the NATO counters in HOI4 do this.   All in all, though, i highly recommend this game. It's a lot of fun. Currently still kickin ♥♥♥ and takin names with The UK. I'm leading my air campaign and in a year and a half of war have managed to keep my casualties under 2000 even after several battles against Nationalist Spain.  PS, did Paradox mean fatalities instead of casualties? I keep reading that and wondering if some of those guys went back to fight. But the skull implies that they died, no?",

The air combat is better than in previous games but the naval bombers are OP and the naval combat is very poor (an ancient navy with naval bomber coverage can destroy the Royal Navy - that's how I invaded Britain, I literally didn't invest at all in the navy BUT even when I did it was very poor, with the Japanese Navy I went against the Chinese Navy and although they met many times the Chinese ships kept staying alive until I eventually conquered China by land and annexed it). It does offer replayability BUT in its current state is too unrealistic, even a banana country can build tanks without any special requirement and the nukes are glorified confetti - until the last expansion all they did was some infrastructure damage, now they also reduce national unity (willinglness to fight until surrender) down to 10% at most and some small damage to units and if you mention anything about the historic use of nukes/a-bomb in destroying cities and killing the manpower (which would be useful against big nations AND nukes did that in previous HoI games) you get told that it's not allowed on the libshit/SJW Paradox forum (I wouldn't be surprised the AI is bad because they refused to hire people based on actual skill and instead went on some 'progressive' policies).

HOI III did a lot of things that the mod did and expanded on others which made me appreciate the game even though I couldn't get into it as much as I did in TRP.  This game... It has THE BEST (and I capped it cause I mean it) economy and production bar none. The way you develope your nation to become an industrial power house is to build civilian infrastructure to then build military infrastructure which you can earmark for production of specific items.   Combat is also very good with the battleplans offering some really fun interactions where you can rely on the AI to micromanage the front pretty well while you focus on something else (your own push probably).   And now we get to the steps back:  1st - This game has the worst resourse management in a HOI game. Trade is pretty much automated and you cannot trade in one resource for another. You must always dedicate one of your factories to produce for the nation in quyestion which takes away a lot of the immersion for me (why the hell does the SU or the US need Italian factories doing things for them when their industrial capacity dwarfs mine by a lot?).  2nd - The national focus are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. They always take 70 days and they offer you random bonusesand unlock certain events. I much prefer HOI3 or DH event mechanism. It is more thoughtfull.  3rd - research is awefull. They went back to HOI2 system which is a huge nono for me. Plus, the tech tree is kind of bare though the ability to build variants offsets it a bit but it is still barebones.   SO, overall, it is a HOI game but it is pretty meh. It desperatly needs mods to make it more engaging and there are things I don't know if modders will be able to circumvent...   I actually have trouble saying if I recommend this game or not but due to the deep production system, I will recommend it... But seriously, if you enjoyed HOI3, this might not be for you.",

            "review_text": "After 13.5hrs, I can say the game is much more intuitive than its previous iteration. That being said, there is still a learning curve and you might find yourself lost, not knowing what to do, specially when a full-fledged world war begins and all your mistakes start to really punish you [like falling behind on techs because you wanted to get that super advanced tech wayyyy ahead]. Try not to get your armies surrounded and stuck because you stupidly wanted to rush the enemy's capital, it's definitely not a game for rambos like that, you will lose the war, specially if the enemy breaks through your now fragile frontier defenses. Plan ahead, make sure your armies are trained. Needless to say, it'll be so much easier if you don't just recklessly and mindlessly jump into the battlefield. The planning system is there for your advantage if you can make the most of it, intelligently. Being very tactical actually pays off, it can really make a huge difference.  Playing with huge countries (like the USSR, Germany, France, Italy and Britain) can be quite challenging when you have to manage such a humongous number of regiments, it can get overwhelming for some people. I'd suggest you start with a medium-sized country first so you can learn the basics.  Since this is the vanilla version, I expect Paradox to add a lot more content in the years ahead. I'm specially looking forward to a better trade system and policies, I'd love to make some strategic embargoes, like starving Germany out of its key imported resources. The potential is nearly infinite. I am expecting a lot more tech trees tailored for different countries outside of the major ones as well, because that's what gives them a really interesting personality and flavor.",

Hearts of Iron IV fell short of the expections I had of it, really it was my fault but I've been a huge hearts of iron II fanboy and I was hoping for something like that. The game is still immensely fun with even the minor nations being enjoyable to play thanks to the new national focus system, you will find yourself spending hours playing any nation. If you enjoy grand strategies this is a nice entry point in an interesting point in time.  Pros: +UI is friendly and easy to use +National Focus System +Research is clear unlike in HOI3 +Any nation is playable  Cons: -AI seems incapable of anything but blobbing -Naval warfare is yet again a joke -Not nearly as in depth as HOI3 -It's shallow for a grand strategy  Overall I'd reccomend the game while it is on sale. I'm certain it'll be better when it has been through another round of patching but if you are looking for something like Victoria II or even EUIV, it's best you keep looking this game isn't nearly as in depth.",

It's by no means perfect, but what it is is a rather polished, and very functional experienece, with all the features it needs to have, unlike some games (I'm looking at you Stellaris). From my experience so far, which is comprised of a Legionary Romania Campaign, here are my thoughts.  +Diplomacy works fairly well, you're able to change your own nation's alignment and fairly easilty join the faction of your choice (faction leaders have +20 reson to accept a player, which I rather like). -It's a bit too easy to convert other countries' political landscapes. As a tiny nation, I shouldn't be able to make a scratch on the U.S., let alone stage a facist coup. While alot of people do like that they can change everything, I think a good compromise can be found if in histotical focus mode, the AI takes goverment staff to defend its ruling party, and the US should have a harder democracy drift. -EDIT: After further play, I've realized the AI needs serious improvement. It simply refuses to march into undefended land, even when it would reduce the size of the front, and really loves attacking into losing battles for the fun of it. It seems to have something of an idea of how to defend its own territory, but on the attack it is simply useless most of the time. It furthermore attacks on multiple fronts only sometimes, when it should at all possible oppurtunities, likes to get its own tanks pocketted, and fails to take advantage of pockets when it makes them. +Battle plans are actually quite nice. You don't have to use them of course, but it's not as simple as drawing a line and an arrow and clicking go. You can have multi-stage, multi-front grand plans laid out, assign each division to each stage of the assault as you see fit, and really have a ball with it.  +It's hearts of iron. My elite unicorn tanks are the scourge of Communism.  Overall, this game has the makings of something great; the AI just needs to pull its own weight. I'm sure multiplayer is a nulear blast, though,",

I have played each of their core grand strategy games, epecially Europa Universalis IV and Victoria II, which I have hundreds of hours of playtime, both online and offline. I played Hearts of Iron III, however, the interface combined with the immense complexity seriously limited me, even though I understood each of the other games perfectly.  Hearts of Iron IV is a different beast all together. The game has been simplified for new players, however, it still has a steep learning curve and good management skills, similar to the other games. This is a great thing, as it can attract more players, but it can also keep the returning players.   Pros - Great Interface Beautiful Map Good Research Trees Intuitive Battle plan system Simple, yet effective Industry system Good Alliance System  Neutral - More Simple than recent titles (Good or bad, depending on the player)  Cons - Performance drops off following 1944 or so Small nations can easily grow exponentially Generic trees for every nation except the seven major nations Poor tutorial (again) At times, victory can be too easy  Despite some problems, as mentioned above, the game usually runs very well and is quite an enjoyable experience. Each decision made must be thought through before executing, as one poor choice could set the player back months, or even end their campaign. In addition to this, future updates will likely enrich the game and perfect the game in general. Overall, I seriously recommend this game to anyong who enjoys Grand Strategy, WWII games, or any Paradox titles.",

So I started the game discovering that I was at war with Ethiopia. I won easily enough. A short while after the defeat of Ethiopia I decided to expand my lands! I set my gaze on Yugoslavia, so I began justifying a war goal. Conquest of course. When the justification finished I declared war on the Yugoslavians, my massed divisions advancing into their lands. The Yugoslavians panicked and joined the allies, in turn making me panic and join the axis to have the Reich on my side. I started World War Two two years early. I started it in 1937. Over the course of the war I took some lands for myself, Greece and Southern France. The Reich took Northern France, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and many others, even pushing into Soviet Russia. The Axis grew, the Allies grew, too many countries to name.   For a time everything was great, I had gotten rather low on equipment for my armies so I decided to hold my lands and build my armies. The Germans had taken much Soviet land, but a problem arose. Denmark had taken advantage of the Reich's army being at the Russian front. They, backed up by Allied troops, pushed into the Reich's original lands and even taking Berlin! The end of the Axis was near! we were pushed back and lost our land. Our eventual defeat.",

I do recommend you to buy this game despite the negative reviews about bugs and AI, because you can still pull hours of fun from this game in Single player, and even more with your friends in Multiplayer.

You can easily play as the powerhouse countries like Germany/USA but also have the choice of playing as smaller insignificant countries like Luxemburg. This game will constantly have you on your toes if you choose a corresponding difficulty the AI at times can be ruthless. Production needs to be micromanaged for a little bit but once you start to take over the world it’s almost a 'set it and forget it' when your producing 345 guns a day and are just stockpiling them up. The game has a lot of interesting diplomacy like sending Lend leases or volunteer troops to help a country either fight off a uprising or help the uprising overthrow the current government. Multiplayer is good although slow at times depending on your connection to each other, you need good internet for this game to go at a decent pace. It can take upwards of 4+ hours to conquer Russia depending on difficulty and your troops/tech level. Research is the key to any real victory because once you can launch the Bomb you can basically crush any country into submission. There are things in place to make that difficult like Air Superiority and Navel superiority. I mean it’s a grand strategy game and this game does its job. A really nice game with a lot of things that once you as the player have figured out how they work make the game even more enjoyable. easily 8.5/10",

While games like TW Warhammer may have pretty new units and easy multiplayer access they lack any sense of strategy or AI realism. Hearts of Iron is quite the contrary in how it is all about the gameplay and mechanics of the AI rather than just looking appealing. That being said the way they did the landscape and units in this game still looks really nice if you can get past the somewhat confusing management system, and although the AI can be a bit easy to manipulate in easy difficulties overall the game doesn't feel cheesy or unstrategic as many other strategy games do. To top it all off their dipplomacy system is probably the best I've ever seen in an RTS full of espionage.",

I've played, at time of writing, 467 hours of HOI4 since purchase. 467 hours of fun.  467 hours = 934 beers (467*2) = £3,736 (934*4)  Nearly 4 grand worth of enjoyment for less than 25 quid, and no hangover or liver failure to show for it.  10/10 - Best value game ever.",

I booted up this game and decided to play the tutorial because I know Paradox has a very steep learning curve. I got in the tutorial and literally I had no idea what I had to do (go from one step to another to complete). I said screw it and decided to start up as a minor power, so I could learn the ropes at more minor scale and when something happened be able to see why it happened (instead of managing millions of soldiers at the beginning).   I figured out why people do not make WWII games about being Iran and thought they I would play from the Middle East's prospective. Try to keep the region protected and out of war and possibly even resurrect the Ottoman Empire (should have been Turkey for that, but still part of that land). Anyways I was going to keep my country afloat through raw production and trading with everyone so they liked me. I built up so really nice tech such as the atom bomb which I completed in June 1945. Albeit I did not have the resources for example to bomb Berlin, or Rome. I did have the range and power to make it a very effective deterrent, not that I needed it as anyone with any power liked me to do my political scheming. What they did not know is that I was causing uprisings across the world and doing what I can. In my game I did more than the United States (obviously mine was indirectly, my troops never fired a shot). This is mostly because I gave Japan such a hard time because I was backing China, that they never bombed Pearl Harbor, so the US entered the war in 1944, way, way too late. So the good news is, Iran built the atomic bomb and did a heck of the job fighting the evils of the Earth. The bad news is that the Axis one (Iran is still safe and sound). ",

Let's get the multiplayer out of the way right off: it's buggy and tends to crash. Nothing new if you've played Paradox games before... Games run out of sync and crash, sometimes every five minutes and sometimes only after a few hours. Save often if you  really  must play this in multiplayer.  As for the single player... It's just horribly imbalanced. Control of the air is absolutely necessary to safeguard your land battles, so whoever has the better and most fighters will usually dictate the war. Staging a coup or supporting a political party in a foreign nation is as easy as pressing a button and waiting for an event to trigger. Starting in 1936, you could literally turn the United States into a commie nation before the great wars even begin. I would comment on the UI and the actual planning etcetera of the battles... But it's hard to pinpoint exactly what's wrong with it. All I can say is that it's clunky and your troops will often do strange stuff that you never even ordered them to do.  That being said, I'm enjoying it, maybe because I never played HoI3 and I don't have a frame of reference. If you are a big fan of Paradox grand strategy or even just WW2 in general, I don't think you'd hate yourself for buying this game. There are definitely a few hundred hours of fun stowed away in here.  If you're only moderately interested, I would advise you to wait for the first batch of DLC and bugfixes, as well as a sale.

The only reason I won was because I did a flanking rush through to the capital with some motorised units. So I am finding it challenging but far easier to understand than the previous HOI games.  There are some annoyances - the game really needs a paper manual like HOI2 used to have, you dont have a news ticker now only important events are portrayed to you, you cant stop ships once they start travalling to merge with a distant fleet, you cant seem to mothball old planes so you have lots of older equipment which when in the reserves doesnt get updated, and its not clear why units often refuse to carry out their battleplan orders - sometimes you have to fight against the battleplan AI to move troops where you want unless you remove them from the army completely.

This allowed me to punch through with my Light/Med Tanks, then move through with my slower Infantry/Tiger divisions to hold the line/protect supplies.  -The Planning/Front Line mechanism removes the need for constant micro management.  -Air &amp; Naval combat is much more accessible &amp; interesting. Amphibious landings are very easy to carry out now.  -Some of the Alternate histories that are created are interesting. In Europe there was the Allies, Axis, Commies &amp; Polands own faction allied with the Baltic States.  Cons  -AI; No Paradox game has launched with amazing AI. They are working on it as usal.  -My Macbook sounded like a jet Engine even with all settings minimum. The issue was that even with Vsync my IGPU was trying to pump out 75FPS. I had to go into the settings.txt and limit my FPS (Refresh rate) to 30. After this, the game runs smooth &amp; fine without noise/heat issues.  -Only WW2 era, no Cold War/Modern Era YET. I'm sure we'll see a new Aresenal of Democracy iteration sooner or later.  Overall; It's my favourite Hearts of Iron by FAR! I recommend it if you are a fan of the series or you were put off by the UI of previous installments.",

Though i'll put that down to having never played any of the previous HoI games.   I did however once I got the hang of it start enjoying myself alot more. It's actually really fun, dispite what some people think about 'staring at a map' sort of games. Playing as some of the smaller countries and trying to defend yourself and hold alliances is fun whilst playing as the larger countires and attempting to wage war and keep your colonies in tact is a whole different challenge.   If you like grand stategy games and have the time you wanna invest in actually learning how to play and putting effort into the game you'll enjoy this no doubt!",

            "review_text": "I have never had any experience with previous HOI games, so I'm coming at this game from a new player's standpoint. So why do I not recommend this game?  The game is unfinished no matter how you look at it. It's fun to play the major powers at first but once you play some of the minors it gets boring fast. All of the minors have the same tech tree, generic portraits, and challenges. You catch up in research in 3 years time, then you invade the other minors around you.  It honestly poses NO challenge whatsoever , and that is bad considering I have only played around 60 hours of this game and I can already play on veteran difficulty with ease.  And speaking of how easy things are in this game, you can bend history to whatever you like. Want to make China communist? fascist? want to start a civil war? How about the US? The UK? the list goes on and on, and changing the playing field is so easy that it almost breaks the game IMO.  you can start ♥♥♥♥ in countries and get them to change their ideology too easily, or weaken them by starting a civil war with ease.  Even if you are El Salvador, you can make the mighty United States fascist, and this honestly makes no sense.   And this leads to the war itself, the key selling point of the game. It is sometimes very tense and enjoyable but other times unbearable.  The enjoyable part is actually seeing everything click in your country,  all your armies going into battle after years of preparation, all your factories churning out material for your resources and military equipment. Usually you have to fight one or two major powers near you (i.e Germany v. Poland and France) but once those fights are over (if you are successful) I can only describe the rest of the war as a wild goose chase. When the war itself starts it isn't just country A vs. country B. Most of the time it is between the factions (allies v. axis, comintern v. axis etc.) These factions don't just have one or two countries in them, but five or ten. So once you knock out France and Poland as Germany, now you have to fight the United Kingdom, Canada, The Netherlands, Belgium, and later on the United States. Even if your armies are three times as large as all of those people combined, you have to make every single one of those countries surrender, all of them. It doesn't matter if you have the UK, US, Canada and all the other major powers defeated, you still have to fight New Zealand, or Australia, or the British Raj etc.  The game has a terrible system of peace treaties, and this NEEDS to be addressed   This brings me to my final point, and that is the AI. historically, Paradox has had issues with AI in the past with their other games. The  AI in this game, though, is very bad.  During the world war, a country like Germany might all of a sudden declare war on Brazil, even though there is no possible reason why they would do that. Strategically it doesn't make sense, and it only makes the war longer, and more of a pain in the ♥♥♥. In peace conferences/treaties, the AI makes the same mistake.  it will try to puppet countries half way around the world, take provinces in places that don't make sense, and screwing up the borders of pretty much everything.  Honestly if you still want to buy this game i would recommend just calling a run complete once you get the last enemy to surrender, forget the peace conference, since there is a high chance you won't get what you want.  As of now this game in it's current state is lacking in many areas. Only time will tell if Paradox will patch the game to make it better, or just slap 10 DLC's on to the game with high price tags to 'fix' the game. Until then, don't buy it, it's not worth your 60 bucks.",

            "review_text": "HOI4 is an excellent grand stratergy war game, which focuses largely on you being a commander and planning out your battle plans with a fantastic new battle planning system, not present in previous iterations of HOI. This is also supplemented by a fantsticly styled game, which even utilises the day, night and weather to effect combat conditions. However, this game has an array of problems with it...  Firstly, the AI... Now I know AI is difficult to program in the best of circumstances, but in games where AI is literally essential, it should be top priority, above all else. The AI for the most part is ok, but when it comes to naval invasions, creating armies and supply management, it completely fails. Most AI invasions are very small scale, and are usually if successful not followed up with any significant force to create a beach head. The AI also has a crappily made army creation and resource management system, it seems the AI follows the rule of creating enough resources to produce a specific type of division, and then completely ignores focusing on supplying that division with enough resources, instead it will then focus on producing more divisions of varying types creating ridiculos armies of 1500 divisions in some cases (for large countries such as USA), which is completely unessesary and causes alot of lag towards the end of the game, this also means that through prolonged fighting, most divisions will run out of supply and will capitulate before human players.  Secondly, replayability. This game's content is warfare on the same map, the only replayability is with different nations and different starting conditions. Making the game extremely repetitive after the first 20-30 hours after becoming familiar with most of the games mechanics.  However, despite these problems, I find it hard to deny that the game is fun in short campaigns every now and again, which is why I give HOI4 a 7/10.  TLDR; HOI4 Is a good grand strat war game, fantastic commanding ability, cons are poor AI for invasions, army creation, resource management, moderatly repetitive gameplay after 30 hours, final rating 7/10.",

(if you play as an underdog like, Turkey. It will take you up until 1942 at the least to become relevant).  However if you can look past that, the game is really fun, it has a lot of things I found very fun to play with.

While there are some out there who are complaining that this game lacks the complexity of HOI3, the reality is that this is a positive, not a negative, fact about HOI4. I loved HOI3, but never had enough time to master its complexity. I could never quite figure out naval battles and so was unable to truly enjoy playing as a naval power. While there are some players out there who can invest hundreds of hours in to a game, most of us are more like me who may get one hundred hours total out of a given title. For us, too much complexity detracts from a game because we know that we will never be able to truly master it.   HOI4, on the other hand, provides the joy of waging WW2 with just the right amount of detail. Whereas I always micromanaged every individual division in HOI3, the AI in HOI4 is of a high enough quality to trust to manage your defensive and offensive actions. Battle plans are easy to draw up and are lots of fun to watch play out. Additionally, unlike HOI3 the national focus trees allow you to play out your favorite alternate history scenarios without needing a mod.   In short, if you like paradox games in general and if you like world war 2, buy this game. You will have a ton of fun.",

The problem is the Soviets stack so many troops on the front lines so it's impossible to push trough them  - The Thing with A.I naval invasion for example i was playing as UK (GB). USA just stacked 100 divisions in my provinces on my island and they didn't do anything even when i launced a naval invasion on France  -- I hope this problems get fixed but so far it's a greaat GAME",

I prepared for a year, then started WW2 in 1944, defeated Allies within a year, and then Soviet Union within a year.  The AI has some problem. They won't attack even with overwhelming strength.

            "review_text": "Plenty of other people have talked about the features they liked and disliked, so I'm simply going to respond to some common criticisms I see  -'HOI4 is not a complex as Paradox games'  This is correct. However, what those people DON'T realize is that complexity =/= depth. HOI4 has depth. However, unlike HOI3, that depth isn't blocked by an awful, unintuitive UI. HOI4 is admittedly lacking a few features (intelligence agencies is one that comes to mind) but it is MUCH better than other Paradox games at launch and I can only see the game gaining depth, and with Paradox's apparent new focus on accessibility (see: Stellaris)  -'Only the major factions have dedicated focus trees'  Yeah, as if Paradox is going to write 100+ focus trees for individual nations. This is something that will be fixed by DLC and mods. It is certainly not a valid reason not to get the game.   -'The AI is bad!'   The AI can be bad sometimes, but at others, it can be great. It's inconsistent right now, but the fact that the AI CAN make good decisions proves that the capacity for good decisions exists. Patches will likely improve the consistency of the AI, and even if it doesn't happen soon, the AI is good the majority of the time. Besides, there are already mods that improve the AI   -'The game has poor optimisation late game!'  This one is the only valid complaint, and again is likely to be fixed by patches   I think that's most of the criticisms. The people who 'played HOI since HOI1 and think it's utter casual trash' can go suck a ♥♥♥♥, I've played since HOI1 and this game is great. It's simply nostalgia vision talking, you forget the dozens of hours it took to fully learn the ♥♥♥♥ing mechanics of the earlier games   In my books this is a solid 7.5/10 and it's only going to get better",

If you want fewer options and choices, buy this, if you want more realism, buy HOI3.   So, what are my main issues with this game? 1. No stockpiles. Given that the Axis is short on alot of supplies, stockpiles is what you want if you play as them. This would allow you to build a stockpile before the war starts, which just might last you long enough so that you can take the resources needed by military might. This was what the Axis did IRL. The Germans and the Japanese espesially relied on this. In this game, NOT an option.  2. Research. Every tech is tiered, and tied to a specific year. You can, but it will be a poor choice, try to focus on say tank research all the way, but due to the penealties that are given because of the 'hey that did not really appear untill 1944' mentality, it tends to be a losing path.  3. As in all previous versions of this game, naval and aerial battles are something you have less control over, and it is annoying for sure.  4. The AI. Oh my. Watching the AI launch an invasion, then march their entire army towards say Berlin, just to be cut off because they are not guarding their path, and then annilated because they have no supply path, is painful...  5. Bugs. There still are quite a few. Get the Anschluss with Austria. Try to upgrade the AUstrian troops to German standard, and they all disappear. Epic stuff like that.   So, is there nothing good? Well, off course there is, but to me, HOI3 is still a better game by far, so untill this game has been properly patched and balanced, I would buy HOI3 over HOI4.",

After playing this game for 200+ hours I still enjoy creating different scenarios on the world stage and playing through them. The AI does from time to time act in a strange way, but it hasn't ruined my gaming experience. Another thing that needs mentioning is the score soundtrack - it's great!

For example: Giving the error of certain divisions are still moving (double yellow dots and green arrow) when they're in place, but the real error is there's just too many of them to commit to a naval invasion. It seems the code here jumps to defaults too quickly for user conditions not being met instead of laying them out explicitly.   Also, it would be nice if the AI can remove their planes from an airbase whenever you stack yours. Let's say I'm attacking Soviet Union as the US from Germany, and want to use their airbases. But the other allies have filled their planes in accordingly. Once I fill my planes they should remove theirs so as not to penalize me. It seems to be a race to fill airbases before a war. If the AI has planes in their airbase, chances are they will just sit there (another bug).  Overall this game is wonderful and polished.

The UI can be a little tricky at first and the constuction and production screen can make a new players head spin, but once you get used to it its a peaice of cake to handle. The national focus idea is probally the single best feature in the game. All of the major 8 nations in the game get customized national focus trees. If you play a minor nation like sweeden or austria you get a genertic one but it is still great, For example on Franch's national focus tree you are givin the option to extend the Maginot Line or as Germany you could befriend poland instead of invade it. The national focus tree has so many options for each of the 8 major nations and the choices you make on it can determine weather or not WW2 happens and why it is fought for a completly diffrent gaming experience each and every time.  The division system has been signifigantly improved seince HOI3. It is alot less complitcated and now you only need 1 general or feild marshal rather than having to pick one for each and every division and army group. They have now made so that you can draw front lines and their corresponding offensive line. You can also draw fallback lines and the garrison tool which will make all selected armys go to the selected provinces and will gaurd the most important things in those areas suck as factories and oil refeneries. All of these features are now controlled by a amazinf AI that has been improved 1000% sense the last game and is now smarter with troops and better and making offensives happen like you want to. Also the game encourages you to use the AI as when you do each divison gets a 50% planning bonus which means that they will be better organized and they will attack and defend better than if you did it by hand. The diffrent skills for generals and feild marhsalls make a UGE diffrence when it comes to attacking and defending. For example a general can get traits like panzer leader or mountaineer which means that tanks attack better and go faster and all units are better in mountanious terrain. The same goes for feild marshalls as well.  The only bad things about the game are that the navy and planes need a little work. First of all the AI for it is very overwelming is unnassaryly complitcated. Also it can be made to select the diffrent naval and air bases respectaly they need to be bigger and more easly clickable.  In conclusion this game is one of the best games paradoz has made in years and I recomend that everyone buy it. However i must recomend the colonel version as it gives customized tanks and planes to all 8 major nations and it is really worth it.",

I tried HOI3, but after many hours I still hardly understood anything and got a bit frustrated. HOI4 is so much easier to get into, and while the learning curve is still a bit steep (for a newbie like me), I feel that I understand the fundamentals, and only have to google a bit occasionally when some things does trouble me - naval invasions for example took me some time to understand, but when I researched a bit on the internet, it all made sense. I see some people with a lot of expirience with Paradox games, reviewing this, and complaining about it is to simple. My guess is that Paradox will ship a lot of DLC that will add complexity to the game - as they usually do.  So if you are new to Paradox games - this is where to start!",

I clicked to start research on it anyways thinking... why not get a head start... can't hurt right??? WRONG!!!

I just finished a playthrough with France...I didn't save enough political capital to raise my conscription army so my Maginot line was easily encircled. I refused to go Vichy, so all of France was taken except for a small force that I was just barely able to smuggle to the UK (sound familiar). I transfered this force to my Africa holdings, and had enough surplus infantry supplies to create a few divisions. I was lucky, I still had air and naval superiority over the Western Med, and Corsica, the only place outside of mainland France I could spawn units, was still mine.   With about 10 division joining up with my 14 divisions holding the line in West Africa, I began a desparate fight to push the Italians back into the sea. Lucky for me that the UK didn't take kindly to Cairo falling, and had sent in about 25 divisions to whoop Italian butt in Egypt. After a grueling 6 month battle we finally encircled the Italians and destroyed them.   At this point, the UK had landed a small beach-head in Sicily. I immediately sent half my divisions to help maintain it. At this point I was begining to build a relatively decent force in Corsica. I shipped my remaining divisions to an allied port in Greece and began plans for a naval invasion of the Italian mainland. I landed and was shortly joined by my allies. We fought for a year with heavy casualties, but eventually choked the Italians off and they capitualated. I could see my homeland! With great vigor I began an aggressive battleplan to libertate my home. Joined by my allies in the West we pushed until we met at Paris...Champagne for everyone!!!

            "review_text": "Tentative reccomendation that I waited a while to write until I was sure what I wanted to say:  My very first Paradox game was HOI3, which I loved. It launched me into Ricky, Rome (briefly), CK (briefly), EU3, Vicky2, CK2, EU4, Stellaris, and a few other things along the way. Finally we've come full circle at HOI4.  I like it, the base game's a bit underwhelming as someone who played a lot of HOI3, but the core mechanics are pretty good and there's room to grow. I love the focus trees, which really serve to differentiate some of the major powers. I hope that, given time, we'll see plenty more of those for more interesting minors, but I understand that's already the plan. I really DO NOT like the simplified army-unit structure, I wish there were more layers of command structure, if not quite full HOI3-esque OOBs then something where I can see more actual leaders, because in all honesty I think having traits from your most senior commander affect individual units doesn't make sense since the actual leaders of those units probably would affect their behaviour more. I feel most of my complaints about the game center on this simplification of concepts present in HOI3, which admittedly was necessary since HOI3 was a beast to learn and master but even things like the 'triangle of leaning Axis/Allied/Comintern' that made a LOT of sense are gone.  All those complaints considered, WW2 strategy games like this are harder to make long-term interesting than CK2 or EU4 or Stellaris for a very important reason: Over centuries of gameplay, wars start and end, and nations go on to different concepts or challenges. But for a game solely focused on WW2, that can be hard because the war has to be very detailed while also being simple enough to understand, as once that war starts it's a brutal fight to the end. And despite my complaints, this constant slugging-match feeling is where the game shines. The new battle-plan style army management is a real gem, as are more extensive conscription/economic options. Allocation of factories to specific production lines, something abstracted with IC in HOI3, is fully fleshed out here and makes for a MUCH more detailed logistical game, which again was a major issue with HOI3. I absolutely love needing to shift factories from tanks to planes and having a major loss of efficiency, which slowly ramps back up, it's much more realistic and engaging thing and really makes you need to plan out your production better. I really like the new division designer, which again allows for really easy organizational changes to your units. The air and naval systems, while simplified, are VASTLY improved because it was a real pain to manage most of this in HOI3, I usually assigned them to a random AI-controlled HQ and let them take care of it.   All of the above, on the balance, makes this a game worth playing. I expect they'll add plenty of flavor, new mechanics, and more, and tweak some of the more annoying stuff. Currently, it seems to have less development support than CK2 or EU4, but I expect this to change as those games start to reach their final buildout (or at least I hope they are, both have had more expansions than I could easily count), and that resources are shifted. Some of the things I really think the game needs are an in-depth espionage system, a more detailed nuclear/secret-weapon system, a lot more flavor, smarter unit AI, a national-focus &amp; stratetgic AI that doesn't make stupid choices (oh, Finland is part of the Allies in 1939, well I guess I still better declare war on it, said no Soviet Union ever) that negate your strategic or diplomatic brillancy. I'd also like to see an extended postgame or pregame, and better peace conferences (Yalta and others being negotiated BEFORE the war's end, and the ensuing horse trading). And finally, something introduced late in HOI3 that wasn't fully fleshed-out, a resistance system that ties down larger numbers of units in a garrison format, there are so many different ways that could go.  Tl;dr: Needs more work, but pretty good and will get better as it's a newborn and PDS will alter it dramatically over the next 2-3 years. 7/10 at present, I expect it to go up with time.",

            "review_text": "The game has been dumbed down from hoi3. It feels like an emtpy shell, there is allot missing. The Air interface is extremly confusing for new players, battle plans are limeting and also very confusing until you get 30h+ into the game. In Paradox ambition to make the game more accesible and easy to learn they removed the essense that made Hearts of iron good. The hearts of iron serial has gone from beeing a masterpeice to beeing a simple arcade game.  Also, expect atleast 10+ DLC's for around 30 USD each that you will need to make the game good. and 50+ spirites and other worthless DLC's. Paradox interactive's new bussnies model is make an half finished game and sell what's missing for insane prices.  But even after bashing the game, i kinda recomend it, it's still hearts of iron, and it is not that bad. Just because its a dumbed down version of hoi3 doesn't make it bad, no it is still a good game and it's very fun to play with others. Paradox interactive is like a heroin adict son that steals all your ♥♥♥♥ (empty our wallets), but you can't stay mad, he's family.  So i'm chainging my negative review to a possetive one.  Oh and a tip if you're new to Paradox games, i know it seems hard at first, but keep trying, you'll learn. I probably spent 100h at my first paradox game (hoi2) before i learned it.",

            "review_text": "I am going to reference Hearts of Iron 3 a lot in this review, so if you haven't played that game some of what I say might not make a lot of sense.  I like the new production system, instead of building the divisions like in Hearts of Iron 3, you build the weapons for the divisions and then train the soldiers with the weapons. The efficiency bonuses for continuing to build the same thing instead of switching up are good too. Manpower is more realistic too, based on your total population instead of a constantly increasing value like in HoI3. Having caps for the industry in provinces makes sense too, although I will miss turning isolated islands into industrial power houses.  Ground combat has seen some improvements too, units that are being controlled by the AI can now be manually controlled when the AI is too stupid to do something. Amphibious invasions have to be planned, which is limiting from HoI3 but in a good way, in my opinion.  End of war diplomacy has seen a big improvement with the different winners taking turns cutting up pieces of the country instead of just holding whatever ridiculous pieces you happen to have walked troops through like in Hearts of Iron 3.  Now for some stuff I don't like. Air combat and naval combat is ridiculously simplified. Instead of assigning your air forces to attack a specific territory you have to assign them province level instructions and hope for the best. I know that in Hearts of Iron 3 it was a pain to be controlling each unit and assigning them to each territory but this is too simplified. The national focus trees are a great idea, but I feel like you can complete them too quickly and don't give enough divergent options. And why can't I design a new division template without war experience? Seems like a very arbitrary limit.  I'm sure there will be lots of changes to the game through patches and DLC to fix issues, but it is fun to play in its current form so I recommend it. However, if you already have Hearts of Iron 3 and are having fun with it, you might want to wait and pick up this one when it's on sale.",

            "review_text": "I did and do enjoy my time with the game, but thats because I was able to get used to a couple of terrible flaws of the game, that should actually be dealbreakers, and the only reason I powered through was because I was so hyped for the game.  Having gotten used to them, the game is fun, but for the first hours I was astonished at some of the bad decisions made in the making of this game, and to this day I'm struck by paradox not fixing them even though some really wouldnt be that hard to fix.  Looking at it plainly there are HUGE problems with the game, and to someone who's not already entirely sure that he loves the game I would not recommend it at it's current stage and the current speed of development.  The first flaw is the stuttering in mid-lategame which people with all kinds of hardware, including high-end, report, so its not my setup. The game can't handle its own troopcount and the lategame is a slideshow. (Though there's some people who report not having issues - either they are lying fanboys or the game just doesn't work well with some setups, nevermind the quality)  But this is optimization. I see that this will take a while to fix. What I can't understand are some design decisions that just baffle.  A) World Tension is garbage.  Neither does is make sense that Britain can only guarantee the Polish independence from Germany if non-Axis Japan declared war on China (wait, what...? How's that connected!?) or that I can only implement draftlaws after the Civil War in Spain is won by either side, But it also just doesnt work.  1. It means that Germany can take Poland/France/Anything right at the start of the game, because Allies can only intervene at some World Tension and it's too late then, so the first conquest is a freebee. 2. The game wanted to be more 'open' but due to world tension, all countries but the Axis, especially Britain and USA, are INCREADIBLY railroaded, as Britain theres literally one way of chosing your foci and until 100% worldtension all you do is guarantee countries.  B) The Ai is broken Both the 'Diplomatic/World AI' as the strategic AI are broken. The Diplomatic AI is completly useless. All alliances are preprogramed/set by fascist/democrat/commie so it literally does nothing but guarantee all countries with the same Ideology and at some point attack everything that isn't, and I think all 'attacks' are hardcoded. Countries that are at war with someone they are at war with will be asked to join that faction .It can be 'gamed' like crazy. Youre Germany and Want the Soviet Union and the Allies at war? Threaten Finland (i.e. fabricate a claim) before the Winter War. Allies will imidiatly guarantee it and, when the Soviet Union attacks it Allies and Soviets are at war. Thats just one example of dozens of rediculous decisions the AI will do because it doesn't 'think' or evaluate situations but just follows pre-programed instructions. Another would be that if as France or Britain you manage to stop Germany early and push on Berlin, Germany will still declare all kinds of wars.  The War-AI is just dumb. there's no other way of saying it. It's completly useless and the only reason why it can do ANYTHING is because your friendly frontline AI is also broken and constantly redeployes its units along the front, leaving all of them at 0-Strength. However, changes to the big picture, like 2nd fronts opening, naval invasions, shifts of power, sometimes even just the moon shining brighter than before will lead to the AI completly reorganizing, leaving its front basically defenseless, so its possible to defeat Germany as Denmark or Russia as Finlad.  And thats just normal 'front' battles for the AI. AI- Naval invasions are a joke, the Allies will lose Millions of Men in Invasions without ay sense, but they will annoy you like crazy as theres (still after the patch) pissweak invasions every couple of minutes (though admittedly less than before, but this is not OK! We just accept it because its better than it was before but its still ♥♥♥♥!). The AI itself does not defend adequatly against naval invasions, Britain can be taken without problem with 20 units. (Germany has about 200 when attacking France)  C) Half-Baked Ideas Theres so many great Ideas here but all executed terribly. For Example 1. Variants of Equipment. So if you have enough Battlefield Experience you can develop your Tank to be better so your Panzer IV gets better Armor and becomes the Panzer IV A or something like that. But the 'experience' is universal, so usually you will just save it and when researching a new Tank immidiatly make him 'Panzer IV Awesome' and forget it. 2. When researching a tank like the Panzer IV you can research variations of it like a Flak on its chassis or a Tankdestroyer or something. I have literally used this ONCE to try it. Theres no reason for it, because you can attach normal artillery, flak and anti-tank-guns to armored brigades without slowing them down, so why waste research, resources and production capabilities on this special version? Besides, theres no reason why you shouldnt just put 3 Tanks into the brigade instead of 1 Tank 1 TD 1 Artillery as the Stats of the Group are basically the same but the production is more complicated and you might run into not having one of the things, leaving your division weaker! 3. Bombing doesnt do damage to Units, but gives modifiers to Units fighting and all I can ask is 'why?'. If two armys oppose each other and I have absolut air supperiority, why cant I bomb them to destroy euipment, without charging their frontline?  4. Theres no peaceconference until the alliance is defeated. So if Germany helps Italy take Yugoslavia, it will end up with parts of that country until the USA, France, Britain and some other countries are defeated. 5. Naval Invasions aren't controlled directly but you pick a 'startport' and the place of invasion the units involved (with the max number depending on your techlevel) and then everything happens automatically after a while of preparation, if enough convoys are there, naval supremacy is achieved and the stars are aligned properly. Sounds like fun and works decently well on bigger invasions like England or something like that, where you plan one BIG thing, bring everything in order and after a while enjoy the show. But this is INCREADIBLY annoying when attacking Islands like in the Pacific or the mediterranean where you need to plan dozens of these invasions on barely-to-not-at-all-defended islands. 6. Rebels are not Units anymore but just destroy infastructure and factories and must be suppressed by HUNDREDS of Military Police Brigades. NOONE can look at this system and think 'jup. thats fun!' Its tedious! Its annoying! It's boring! It's just plain Work. 7. Trade is now fluent, so theres no Stockpile. If you buy more than you need, that is wasted IC, if you don't buy enough you get a huge hit on your production so thats also wasted IC. This means you must always and at all times be at the perfect 'buy' amount. The old system from HOI2/3 was bad, like always-put-it-on-AI-bad. But this worse! Since due to slowly increasing production and destruction or production of factorys your demand of any resource always changes, You will find yourself changing the imported amount almost daily! WHY do i have to change my tradedeal with Germany daily to just the needed amount? Why can't I say 'buy Steel from Germany' and some lower level burocreat automatically buys the needed amount?   This isnt even everything I would like to mention, but the fact is the game is riddled with insane decisions and while the devs in the forum keep saying they are 'aware' of the problems, so far I have not really seen any improvement - the biggest improvement so far was a change in the peaceconference AI which was also BROKEN and is now only DUMB. And this was achieved by the devs implementing a MOD into the basegame! That's not how it should be!",

To sum it all up the AI is Terrible and there is useless national focuses which the ai can use such has having one focus to puppet a country, but instead of that would then annex it for their own plans which is pointless of them having a focus for such when the AI is active for that country. truthly i like playing the game has the British Empire and Restoring royalist Rule to the Earth and overall its a 10/10 from apart from the isuses i have just discussed with them its a 9/10.",

It's not historically accurate, not a bit, but the craziness and possibilities that you can achieve is just ridiculous. World Devourer Mao, no problem. Roman Empire restored, surething. 2nd Civil War, why not? It's hilariously omnipotent on the alternate history part.  But there are glaring flaws this game has that make me want to punch a baby in its ♥♥♥♥. The biggest issue right now is the AI, it's so incompetent sometimes that it throws the whole game and turns it into a roflstomp. Things like having tens of thousands of men transported across enemy controlled sea zone without any escort; suddenly abandoning a whole front; cramming a very tiny area with divisions to completely destroy allies' supplies; these are just something that I encountered in a few walkthroughs.  HOI IV has huge potential, but at this very moment I'm not sure if I should recommend it.  ----------------------------------------------- I love this game. It might not be as 'realistic' as the previous installments, but it's fun anyways, and with future patches and DLCs it could only get better.  With that being said, the game atm is a little barebone and has a few funky moments, it surely won't please  every diehard HOI fan out there. But hey, I couldn't get into the old HOI games at all, and this game has the right amount of streamlining to hook me up from the very beginning of the tutorial(thank god it's not a series of scripted scenarios anymore).  Concerns: This game, as other PDX games, might be a DLC-fest in the future. Which means: 1) Price of a 'complete' game would be extremely expensive. 2) Some DLCs would be pretty awful given the record of PDX's recent DLC release upon EU4 and CK2.",

HOI 3 while providing a lot of new features seemed to just bog down. There was too much micro management. Now, don't get me wrong, sometimes I like micro managing everything but the trade off is that you will not get too far in the game.   For me starting with a country and building it up and then getting into WW2 was the thrill. But 3-4 years of building equipment, managing stuff, and waiting waiting waiting was sometimes too much. Maybe I have ADD. Actually I do.   So last few years like everyone I've been waiting for HOI4. I think that it finally got rid of a lot of micro management and allowed a player to get through the war faster... though that came with a price. The AI cedrtainly does a decent job, though in some places there needs to be tweaks. I suspect and expect that patches will be forthcoming to address that.   I like the way you can design units. Reminds me of Super Power game where you can design stuff and rename them. I like the battlefront system, though it is clunky at times.   I like and hate at the same time many of the message popups we used to get. I mean I could care less what Siam was doing if I was playing Germany or Italy.   In short, I recommend this game. It is a whole new experience in the long line of HOI games. There are going to be trade offs, and some diehard Grognards are not going to entirely like this new system/game. Then again, it may more accessible, portable down the road to other devices, and at least let you get through an entire war game in less than 30 hours.   But there are areas that need improvement. MODS are already on DAY ONE making a big difference. Tech trees are being expanded, additional photos added, etc. We may have had a more complete game in a year but then we would complain that it was taking another year... so again a good trade off. Get the game now, look for MODS and official patches and updates, as well as DLCs. Yeah we live in the world of DLCs, get over it.   Last on this review... if future patches can expand on the tech trees, add more of the 'missing' stuff, and bring back some of the HOI3 immersive features (even as something we can toggle on/off), then I think Paradox would have a more complete game and certainly appease many of the hard core gamers and naysayers. Finding that balance will be crucial. Some things now seem too easy, while others feel like something is missing, and others feel more difficult than they need to be.

            "review_text": "First of all let me say that I never write reviews. Secondly, for Hearts of Iron 4, I was torn between writing a positive review or a negative review.   1. Hearts of Iron 4 differs from it predecessor game in both it's increase in depth (believe it or not since everyone complained about the difficulty of Hearts of Iron 3) but also it's streamlined capability which enhances it playability. Futhermore, HOI4 can factor in such variables as Hiltler's Great Panzer Heist (a good book to read) which makes it possible for units to be made up of a variety of models of the same equipment. That has been sorely missed in previous wargames (at least in a transparent way) and this mix of models proved to be a great problem for the Third Reich due to the huge maintenance complexity issues which arose for that country. Other countries also had this problem but Nazi Germany took it to an extreme.  2. Back to HOI4s main problem: The lack of an extensive sequential manual for the game means that the gamer must wade through a number of YouTube videos just to sort through this problem. Probably the best YouTube videos for this game come from Praetorian HiJynx. Anyway, this increases the game learning curve for most of us. It seems almost implausable that Paradox Interactive would work on a game for 3 years and not include an extensive manual. And yet that's exactly what they did which diminished their wonderful product. As a note, the Wiki that comes with the game doesn't even approach a real manual.  3. As further deeper insight into this problem, it is rumored that Paradox will float an IPO soon (stock market.) From past experience, I know that this is often the death knell for a company as far as excellence is concerned because corporations then are forced to focus on profit and not competency. Since I have seen what I consider some very poor marketing tactics used by Paradox nickeling and diming gamers to be sure (to be fair here, many companies are using these same tactics), then I certainly hope that the company is not headed in that direction. Especially Paradox who has a unique niche in grand strategy games. But who can say.  4. My final point is clear: PARADOX, GIVE US A COMPREHENSIVE MANUAL. At least something so we can see how all your game components are interacting with one another. It would be nice if as in the past, the manual had reference to strategy and tactics but we at least need the basics or we'll have to sort through a lot of garbage to learn the game like I did.  Thanks for reading my comment.",

They are a bit overwhelming, i'am sure you know that. But not HoI IV. Yes, it's still a huge and complex grand strategy game, no doubt about that. But Paradox did a great job in designing UI. I's is clear, very informative and very intuitive. Something that is so important in a game of this scale. So if you were like me and were afraid of HoI games, fear no more. In 3-4 hrs tops you will easily understand the basics and be able to play and enjoy this one. Obviously you will need to learn much much more, but you'll do that as you go along. Plus in youtube era, it's much easier to learn even the most complex games. There are many great video tutorials out there.  I guess there's no point in explaining in details what HoI IV is. I'am pretty sure everyone knows that, even if you never played a HoI game before. But if you're into deep, historical grand strategy games, where you can change the fate of the world, save it from fascist or communist, conquer it or destroy it, you can't go wrong with it. Do whatever you want and just have fun because it is an awsome game which should get even better with time. Paradox supports it's titles for many years, adding lot's of new content and improving what's already been realased.   I will agree with most of the reviews about poor AI. But truthfully speaking, which game of a scale that big has good AI? I'am afraid there isn't one. IMHO the AI is the weakest element of almost every video game regardless of the genre. And doing a good AI in a strategy game is even more difficult. I choose to accept that. The game is still tons of fun!  ",

Overall as long I can preserve Democracy or make a 1000 year Reich or make a SJW's wet Communist dream I'll be just fine and dandy.

The balance between historical facts and the player freedom to step away from them, was probably the most challenging bit for the developers. So, it's not the game to completely rewrite the history in your sense but since you can take control over many different countries and their specific histories, it still offers enough room to be creative. During gameplay, you must find the right balance between politics, diplomacy, research, recruitment, and production. The tech-tree gives you many options to develop the right combination of gear to supply your troops with. In my opinion the options for diplomacy could be a bit more versatile but I assume that's also down to the fact that it has to follow certain historical facts. It's the first game out of the HoI-series that I have played so I can't compare it to previous versions. This game requires a lot of time to be played properly but if you have some nights to spare and want to get into the position of a leader during WWII it's your choice.",

However, no other world war two game in my opinion can come even close to the amount of enjoyment and pure joy HOI4 have given me. From the company that brought other games that are of no interest to me, this series of games is truly fantastic. However their first REAL DLC for this game put a pain in my head.. and wallet.... The price tag for the first dlc with how little content it gives us is in a way, MAJORLY DISAPOINTING! I hope future content will not follow the same path as the first dlc. But the dlc is not the only problem with this game. With or with out mods, you will experince crashes. I have never been able to find out why this happens but i feel it may have to do with my nation controlling so much territory, and having so many allies and units on the map at one time, cause the engine to have a heart attack and be carted away to the ER leaving me back in the steam menu alone. HOWEVER (once again) with the amount of support the devs give to the modding community is one of the best parts of this already (mostly) fantastic game! One thing that i love is the great fact that they implement mods into the game as already implemented FEATURES!  Beyond the 'few' issues with this game, i love it. A LOT! 8/10 would buy again.",
