            "review_text": "I waited until finishing this game completely (100%, Minigames, Nuts, Time Trials) before writing a review for it.   THE GAME ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Learning the patterns of the enemies and traps is fairly simple, you can figure out any level through trial and error. As the game progresses, the levels become more diverse, challenging and dependent on quick reflexes. You jump and you run: left, right - simple. The control mechanics are quite a deal different than most platformers and similar games - initially it'll feel like you're sliding on ice. To successfully beat levels you have to learn how to control your acceleration/deceleration and jump height, along with the timing that comes with it. None of the levels are reliant on random path entities or unguided events, which is a relief. The boss battles take a while to figure out; the AI is unscripted and at times quite random, selective - the player is wedged between playing aggressively or passively, determining which way is more effective. The goal is simple enough, however - just jump on their heads a few times, induce brain trauma.  THE STORY  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There is no narrative, and thats not a bad thing, Squirreltopia does not need one. Your goal is to kill the evil super bad scary spooky mad-squirrel who has taken to some sort of kidnapping/genocide event. Perhaps the squirrel society does not take much care into mental illness, who knows. You command an ever-changing army of squirrels with their own fur coats and expressive faces; you must send countless squirrels to death, so if you get overly-attached or are a PETA lobbyist then this game probably isn't for you (and I hate you).  Story tl;dr - You good squirrels, many good squirrels die to destroy bad squirrels  THE DEVELOPER ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Dev is a great guy, he gets really involved with his community and throws frequent updates when necessary. He communicates with the players and it's easy to get in touch with him. Prior and post release he has given out tons of copies for lucky players to enjoy. Throw money at him, hes an indie dev we deserve.  Positives  +Fantastic Soundtrack ( I soon bought it afterwards) +Cute and well made sprites, assets +Original level design +Difficulty increases at fair integers  +Insanely Satisfying to beat the more challenging levels +The Dev is a great guy, he really cares about his game  -Some levels require overly precise, frustrating jumps and maneuvers -Timing on 'death wall' chases can often be overbearing -Few of the boss battles are more dependent on luck rather than learning the patterns and AI  Mixed  /The controls take a while to get used to, for new players it'll feel 'off' but along the way you'll realize how well they suit the game mechanics.    Clocking my game at exactly 20 hours, give or take a few minutes - squirreltopia is definitely a bang for your buck, support him by buying the soundtrack in addition, too! It's only a dollar!   Look out for Domestic Dog, an upcoming game of his - I've played it and its a great deal of fun.",

There are a couple things it does right:  The level design is pretty good  The respawning is instant, which is great for keeping you playing.  There's plenty of content and difficulty to the game. But:  The controlls are definetly not very responsive like in super meat boy  You'll often hear the same songs again and again. And the soundtrack isn't that good or anything.  The graphics in the levels is very mediocre at best. The tiling is very noticable. This does however help with clarity with platforming.  The bosses are fairly random, and for me beating them was often times more dependend on luck rather than skill.  Overall this little game is a very enjoyable timewaster, and despite it's flaws it's a platformer that I come back to very often.",

As a former music student, it grinds my gears. *Clarify the locked rooms/key things better. Seeing some rooms locked at World 1 made me confused *Make the secrets of the game earnable by skill, not by sheer luck or jumping into walls expecting it to be not-solid, expecting the secret nut to be hidden behind it.  Overall, I enjoyed playing this game. Not sure if it's worth the money because I got it for free, but I enjoyed it. Good job dev.",

If you're not particularly good at platformers, this may not be the game for you because it is all about timings and accuracy in your landings, but it can still be fun even for people who aren't that good at them. I definitely enjoyed the demo and what I've played so far of this game. Hope to see more great games from Surreal Distractions.   One thing I'd like to add is that when I try to select the option of 'Arrow Keys + Spacebar', the spacebar does not work while in game.",

            "review_text": "Really enjoy platform games, and some of the 'hardcore/tough' ones are done well, like Mr. Bree, and then there are ones like this, that are the opposite. Although it is awesome playing as a squirrel, that's where the fun stops. For a platforming game, it doesn't even get the basics right. For some reason, the platforming involves building up running starts and going through chains of runs and jumps and after you die a bunch of times you get it right. Just doing a little move jump, you are like a rock and barely move in the air. But if you get a running start, you go flying super far. This is a very dumb mechanic. When you build up the momentum of the run jumps, its almost impossible to stop yourself in the air, kind of like mechanic escape. But of course 2/3 of the levels have you jumping on single blocks in the air and in between spikes and bombs and shots. If you want me to do that, make me able to control my character well and make him responsive, not some guy that only works with endless running. The dumb momentum your character has also applies to landing. Even you run and jump onto a block and let go, instead of landing on that block and staying there like in good platforms, you slide forward as if you were on ice, which is super annoying when you have to land on 1 floating block. Countless times I would land and slide off and die, before it would even let me jump again. The checkpoints are terribly done, as there is only 1 per level, and you will constantly die and have to start back aways and do all of these hard jumps again just to get back to where you were before, a cheap tactic to inflate play time, a sign of amature game design. The world hub is also annoying. I would constantly get stuck returning to a level because when you exit a level it spawns you on the door to the level, and if you try moving, since pressing up is how you go to the level (instead of you know, a button, which makes 100% more sense than moving) you will get transported back to the level, a very annoying cycle. Also, you spawn at the first world every time, meaning if you are actually on the 4th world you have to run through 3 world hubs doing platforming to get back to where you want to go, instead of a level choose option, or spawning you in the world hub you exited the game in.   The hitboxes are off. In this artic dragon fight he would come down vertically and he would be 4 body lengths away from me but it would still count as hitting me, which is super stupid. If you stand on top of the tube of a cannon and it shoots, somehow it counts as you getting hit. Then there is poor inconsistant level design. In one level you are supposed to jump in between these two horizontal blocks, and normally when you have to do that, if you jump into the top wall and hold forward, you will land on the edge between the two. Well this game is super buggy and that only works about 1/5 of the times, meaning you must keep repeating it and dying until you get it right. I finally said 'screw it' because the game was so shoddily made in certain parts I didn't want to be punished for it. So try out Mr. Bree, or any other good platformer, but 'hardcore' doesn't need to mean poor platforming mechanics that lead to constant repetition. 4/10.",

However, it ran really slowly on my computer, and even at it's best, the controls were far too sluggish for me. For me, personally, responsiveness of controls are the most important thing for a precision platformer. It's what maintains that fine line between getting frustrated with myself and wanting to do better, or getting frustrated with the game and wanting to quit.  Most computers might run it fast enough to be enjoyable, but even though mine is far above the recommended specs, it's not nearly fast enough.",
