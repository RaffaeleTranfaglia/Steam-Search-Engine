Even if you've never played Defender, there's a lot to love here, from the retro-style graphics to the authentic arcade-quality sound effects to the nail-biting difficult gameplay. Like the games of old, this game will pull no punches. It's random, it's chaotic, and it's a lot of fun. ",

This just brings back all sorts of fun fuzzy memories, a nice relaxing simple side-shooter... I wish we could get more like this.",
