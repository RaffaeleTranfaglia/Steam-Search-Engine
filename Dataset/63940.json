What makes this game interesting, is playing in the Vietnam War era. Not many games touch on this time and more should. So, at least for now, its a unique game that does a better than fair job in giving you the feeling of fightiing in that era. Have fun!",

Pros: -Better graphics (Somewhat) -Set in vietnam -Tanks and helcopters Cons: -Voice acting makes you suicidal -Very little units -Cant even use the helecopters -You have like one tank  Its so bad I dont even want to talk about it anymore.  This game almost made me lose faith in the series completely, until I learned it was made by someone else. I had so much hope and so much potential for this game... They luer you in with false trailers and visuals then ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ you with their giant in-complete ♥♥♥♥.  Please: If you are a fan of this series, DONT BUY IT. I still joke about this game today because it was the WORST game I have ever played.",

Yes this game is hard but it's so pleasing when you do win a round, save as many times as you can your squad is wiped just reload and try a new tactic thats the way you win, keep trying, keep trying new tactics. This game has been a breath of fresh air it has really tested the way I approach playing this game and it will do to you too ......... just don't give up, it is a tactical stratagy game and it will frustrate you but when you win what a win, would only recomend to the die hard vietnam game fan boy or the hard core stratagy gamer or the gamer who likes stratagy games but wants a REAL challenge. Not regretted buying it, been great fun and loving everyminute.",

Hoping to reconsider my excitement for them fulfilling the excitement. They have failed with this game. It is poorly put together missions, with quickly gathered music. Missions have almost no freedom of action. 'Do this or else you fail' The difficulty is put to the extreme, mixed with the horrible level design make this game unplayable. If you are searching reviews whether to buy this game or not. Please buy Men of War: Assault Squad. Because this Vietnam era game has me yelling 'What the F*** is this??' To my computer.",

I played it in Multiplayer with him through a few levels. First thing I noticed was the  - absolutely horrible voice acting.  - No tutorials. Normally I don't care about that but how are you supposed to know you are supposed to fix a vehicle without ever indicating it? Didn't even know you could - The gameplay was slow and boring - There was no sense of satisfaction for me in anything  On a good note, there were no lags at all. And... Well.... No, I ain't got nothing, I really dislike this game. It's a good thing I got it free.   Mind you though it might just not be my type of game. For example I really enjoyed the original 2 Fallout games but I didn't like Fallout Tactics.",

If you try to sneak around to get behind the bunkers in the mission 'What a Job!' you can F@#$%&amp; by traps and you are forced to run at a heavy mg that can kill your whole squad in 5 bursts and i did manage to get through one time and i tossed a grenade at the Mg it did NOTHING and on the mission 'When Trouble troubles you' HOW IN THE HELL ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO FIGHT AN ARMY WITH 2 NVA AND 2 RUSSIANS!?!?!?!?!? well you ♥♥♥♥ing cant even with Rpg's and Draganovs but still this game is bad because of that so i hope the Developers step up their game instead of sit around with their thumbs up their asses and i highly doubt they give a ♥♥♥♥ about this review but yeah this is why i do not Recommend this game at all.",
