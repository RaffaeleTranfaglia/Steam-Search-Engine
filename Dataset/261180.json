The ball can get to ludicrous speeds! But if there is any lag at all whatsoever, it will be difficult to achieve.  There's a baller OST (not many songs though), a nice variety of stages, mostly aesthetic, but still provide a variety in size and significant difference with candyman's special--and a handful of characters with subtle but important differences in their traits.   I highly recommend this game as it is online play, amazing with friends and absurdly addicting for such short matches!  I hope there will be a way to chat with opponents in the game, at LEAST in the lobby. You can not communicate to them not to start a match because you are waiting for more people or if you want them to ready up for the game.   9/10",

            "review_text": "Lethal League is a truly hillarious, over the top take on pong and fighting games.  The general concept is to defeat your opponentt and reduce their stocks (think smash bros) by smashing them with the ball. The ball will deal damage to your opponents after you hit it, but can be hit by them, which can then cause it to deal damage to you. As in pong, you keep rallying the ball back and forth, with it getting faster and faster until one of you is hit, at which point you lose a life and the ball resets.   What sounds like a very simple concept rapidly becomes a hillarious series of 'Oh ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•!' moments in which the ball is going so incredibly fast that you'd think it impossible to hit, but then someone does, and it gets even faster.  Throw in a bunch of colourful and creative characters and stages, along with an incredible sound track, and some very fancy and flashy visual and sound effects that wouldn't feel out of place in an Anime or Manga, and you get an enjoyable and hillarious experience.  Would reccomend playing with friends (up to 4 player) for added hillarity and fun.",

With each strike of the ball, the speed is doubled, sometimes even quadrupled (and in serious cases, maxed at one million). Maybe you and a few friends sit on the couch and hit the ball back and forth a few times. Maybe it's you and a stranger online. Regardless, every hit and dodge are anxiety and adrenaline riddled. With more than four friends who've enjoyed this game with me, we've never experienced any rage or upsetting losses, only awe at how insane it is to bunt the ball at such ridiculous speeds and then pelt it right back at the poor soul who bashed it towards you in the first place. Each character has a special ability that makes the matches all that much more interesting once they've filled their blue bar. Beware Dice and Candy Man. There's also an interesting secret character which you can play as in local matches; I'll let you google the code for yourself.  My friends and I give this game a 10/10 for competative shenanigans and I give it a 9/10 for the minor network bugs.   Worth the price, but I'm glad I snagged it on the humblebundle for a buck.",

The gameplay lives off a wide array of mechanics that are all accessed by basic movement keys and 2 more buttons. Different characters don't only have unique special abilities as showcased in the trailer but also subtle differences in the way they move, their hitboxes and the angles in which they hit the ball. At first, the game is just enjoyable without having any clue of what's even happening, but once you play more you get an idea of how high the skill ceiling actually is. To become a master, you don't only need high knowledge of/experience with the characters and perfect reactions, but also the ability to read, surprise and outsmart your opponent.",

Lethal League is a projectile fighting game which starts off easy to learn, then quickly scales into either a chaotic mess of fun to be had with your friends or a very interesting competitive experience. With a gameplay system that's much deeper than it would seem at a glance, Lethal League provides fun to whoever is willing to give it a shot, and I'd highly recommend you fork out a few bucks for the game that keeps on giving.  It being a multiplayer game, it does suffer from the usual lack of opponents issue when you want to play against someone in less than ideal circumstances. The art of the game certainly isn't particularly striking or unique in any way, just enough so to serve its purpose. Lethal League also suffers from a lack of diverse content, but that's forgivable as what content there is has been polished to a mirror shine.  Every shortcoming listed is easily ignored in favor of a Higher Fun, and you should definitely get in on the chaos everyone's talking about!",

Pros: A fun experience for people who enjoy fast paced, crazy fighting games. Relatively cheap, only $20 at the time of posting this. Great and helpful community.  Cons: High skill ceiling, many people that are still playing have been for almost a year, and very good players with 400-500+ hours are usually going to be found in online matchmaking Unranked matchmaking, there's no ELO system of sorts, so you can play anyone from the range of a braindead squirrel, to a winner of 20 tournaments. Low player count in matchmaking, Lethal League usually does not have a high player count, and they're not always in online matchmaking, so you will sometimes keep matching up against someone you don't want to play against due to them being the only person online who you can play.  Regardless, Lethal League is an incredibly fun and surprisingly complex fighting game, and if you're willing to put in the time and effort to get good, it can be a very self rewarding and fun experience.",

In fact, I think I have decided that once every nine or ten days I think I am going to play a game of my own choosing, in order to balance out the reviews, and to keep me from going crazy. So I figure the best way to start off my ‚Äòplayer‚Äôs choice‚Äô series would be Lethal League, a multiplayer smash fest from Team Reptile. Now, I admitted earlier that I really wasn‚Äôt that big on fighting games, and in fact often just pounded the controller like I was asking for another beer at a crowded bar hoping the other guy walked into my punches. I confess now that there was one unmentioned exception to that statement, and that was the classic Nintendo 64 version of smash brothers. I actually spent a significant amount of time refining my skill in that game, partially because it was a fighting game I was actually fairly decent at, but more because it was oodles of fun, and a great game to play with friends.  Fast forward a decade and change, and we have Lethal League, which is a rehashing of the typical multiplayer chaos on the screen everyone pounding controllers while jumping up and down and ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô kicking each other while playing sort of game, only this time with the added fun of dodgeball rules added in. See, instead of simply smashing each other directly, players instead knock a little color coded ball back and forth with the goal of hitting someone else, knocking them out until the next serve. Difficulty is added as the ball‚Äôs speed increases every time it is hit, giving players a reward for timing over button mashing. Each character even has their own special move, from Dice‚Äôs occasional arcing of the ball over everyone's‚Äô heads to candyman‚Äôs wall-looping trick, each character has a way to frustrate everyone else playing. And with both online and local multiplayer modes possible, this game will give you enough play value to make it worth any amount of money, and eventual frustration over whoever picks Latch. Can‚Äôt recommend this one enough, folks. Have fun!  Game‚Äôs Fate: Kept. Also installed on the laptop. Never know when you want another round Buy/No Buy: Buy. Heck, Buy a multipack and send it to all your friends.",

I do not reccomend this game unless you have at least 1 other friend who owns it and is willing to play with you, as there isnt enough people for online matchmaking to work effectively.",

While playing with my friend, with other people watching, I heard many 'dude that was awesome's or histarical laughter as someone gets hit by a super easy ball. The gameplay consists of hitting a ball back and forth between 1-3 other players, if you hit the ball last, it is outlined in your color and is lethal if it touches the other player. The other player has to hit the ball back to make it their color and to try and get you. This simple gameplay leads to hilarious moments where people get lucky shots and send the ball back even faster to the next player. The ball speed is really fast and sometimes hard to predict when you first pick up the game, so you can feel a real sense of getting better as you play the game. Super fun game, the AI is good, but not outstanding, pick it up if you have friends to play it with.",

With a very simular aspect of a Super Smash Bros. game, It's A four-player game with a objective that's not beating up another player until their health gauge is gone. Instead your hitting a ball at intense velocities slowly creeping up in momentum until one of the players hits it back faster or is knocked out by the ball. This is where it gets insane. Each character, despite its low roster, has special abilities to either make the ball move faster or cause insane mix-ups on the other players. They all have simular properties to SSB characters: like fast falling, Dash Dancing, and floaties. The big thing that you need to learn in this game is not really the technical prowess, but learning the frames of the game, predicting where the balls is going to go, and timing every hit correctly.   Aside from all this jibber jabber, this game offers minimal stuff to do aside from leveling up, unlocking skins, and comepleting a offline challange mode simular to a arcade mode of somesort. The online takes a while to find any kind of matches including 1 on 1 or a free for all battle but I have yet to run into a match where it's just miseriably laggy.   If you want a hype, over the top, different 2d fighter game; play this, enjoy it with your friends or go online and smash some scrubs. I'd definintly recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "Lethal League is one of the most original fighters I've played in a while to the point where I'm not even sure if it could be called a fighter. But, its lack of content (especially in the singleplayer front) makes this game only worth it for a few laughs with friends.  The story is non-existent in this game, but the characters you get to play as and the stages you play in are really interesting and have a very unique style reminiscent of something like Jet Set Radio. The world presented in the stages looks very interesting but you never get to explore it or get to know more about it. Nevertheless, they make for a good visualizer inbetween rounds for this game's excellent soundtrack.  The gameplay revolves around a ball which you hit to make it turn your color which means that any players hit who aren't the same color (assuming you're in a team battle) die instantly. They can hit it again though and make it go faster and faster and faster until someone is hit. This game is so simple yet so mind numbingly complex in its mechanics that it welcomes players from any skill level. Casually, this is a fun game to play with up to 3 friends. Competitively, this is a game riddled with mechanics to be discovered and tactics to be used. This is the perfect balance for any fighter.  But then there's that. This isn't quite a fighter... This is more like 'Super Pong Bros.' in a way. But unlike the Nintendo money machine, this game isn't riddled with content, unlockables or anything really to make for a solid singleplayer experience. This game's only content as far as I'm concerned is playing with friends and to some extent online play. It's unusual mechanics don't really make it pro tournament and competitive play material, although I could see it entirely.  In the end, Lethal League's mechanics more than make up for the lack of content, and while its visual aesthetic can be called archaic for some, it can be seen as artistic. The diversity in the very small roster of characters is there, albeit not too game changing since the only change is usually only the special attack that can be used after 4 successful hits on the ball. Skins and trophies are there for a singleplayer experience, but... I wouldn't advise you playing this game unless at least one friend would play with you as well.  Worth checking out.",

If you get a couple of friends and all play together, this game is one of the best times you'll collectively have. I haven't played in the open multiplayer so I can't vouch for the online community, but playing against friends is simply fantastic. The online multiplayer will occasionally desyncronize when starting a match, but it only takes about 10 seconds to exit the game, restart it, host a new lobby, invite your friends into it, and restart. The desync error also is not particularly common, certainly less than 10% of matches will have this issue. Not a serious detraction from the overall game.  There are, however, two things missing: a replay system and a spectator mode. There are many situations where it would be nice to have a replay so you can answer questions like 'How did that shot hit me?' or 'That was an awesome move, can I see that again?' I hope the devs will eventually include some form of replay management. The inclusion of a spectator mode would make this game viable for some tournaments and casting. I doubt it'll rival things like LoL or DOTA for popularity, but at some events it would be great to have a Lethal League tournament going on as a side-attraction or something.",

The graphics has have a mid-90s 'Street Fighter' look &amp; feel to them, which is quite suitable. Seeing the ball is important &amp; this works well for gameplay. The voice acting is good &amp; actually quite funny at times. A well timed taught can really mess with your local competitors just as much as a well met swing sending the ball spinning. The music is cool. Even people not used to playing video games can get a kick out of this one. Recommended as easy to pick-up and play, yet challenging to master. I would love to see an expansion with more characters, or a sequel, but the game is near perfect as is. Actual LOL fun~",

But the games' mechanics are very easy to learn, infact the tutorial is ~2 minutes long. That being said, I am going to continue playing this game for quite a while, it feels absolutely WONDERFUL to smack the ball around, especially the faster it gets, and you start shouting at the screen to get it. The price point is imo too high, 14 isn't pocket change, considering how much the game actually has inside. I got super hyped and bought it anyway, but that decision is up to you. The online connection is phenomenal, very very few cases when it felt off or jumpy. If I didn't know I was alone, I couldn't tell that the players weren't right next to me. One big probelem though is that if it desyncs, then it's just about over for that room. But i've only had that happen once in the ~16 games I've played as of writing this. Now, if they added Local Play, this game would be completely worth the price, hopefully they add that feature. If you're worried about dumping the cash to pick this up, wait till it goes on sale. Even 10 would be good imo, but I also thought 14 was an acceptable loss",

Also, the game was clearly designed for keyboad and mouse because when you use the controller the analog stick becomes a pointer and in order to select your opponent in a CPU game you have to click this little narrow box. It's very unintuitive. If this dev really wants this game to take off like Rocket League or some such (this game was recommended to my because of my love for RL), they need to make the interface with the controller more intuitive and iron out many bugs.

Trying to find lobbies just to play a fighting game with not much depth to the mechanics wasn't worth it to me. I'm not sure if the concept of a 2 button fighting game is supposed to be a selling point, but to me it wasn't. There's no combos, no blocks, no grabs, and nothing that really gives you the rock-paper-scissors aspect of fighting games you expect in the genre.   If you're new to fighting games and don't expect much in the way of depth of mechanics, this would be fine. For me, it's not enough.

The fighting term 'yomi' is a perfect word to describe this game, 'yomi' meaning predicting your opponent's actions.  Although this game doesn't make it totaly impossible, there is a bar at the bottom of the screen that will fill up during a hit, sometimes quick, sometimes slow. Once it fills the ball will fly out. many players abuse this to hit the ball in the same place, I assume programmers saw this so they created a shield you can activate for a brief period at the cost of your meter, from 1/4 to full.

It's a projectile fighter, so your aim is to hit the opponent with a projectile (in this case, a ball). Simple, right?

Games can be over in a second once the ball starts moving fast, or even in the first ten seconds if you play right or predict your opponents' moves. There's immense satisfaction in each return, and the game really excites you with the euphoria of good returns mixed with the rush and fear if your opponent somehow still returns the ball that you just shot at him at 10000 mph. It's sort of similar to in the projectile match between Link and Ganon in the Legend of Zelda, except you die if you screw up once. There's a few game modes that you can switch between, and there are some options to tweak your matches. The options are a little limited, but honestly, the game is so fun that you won't really even need to switch things around to have a great time. Definitely check this out sometime!

TL;DR - If Super Smash Bros had sex with pong's wife, this is the result you'll get.  The game is so simple yet so hard at the same time. The goal of the game is to knock your opponent out by hitting a ball that can ricochet and bounce off of the walls. The more you hit the ball, the faster it goes. So after you hit the ball around 20 times or so, the match will turn into a cluster‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• of eternal schorcing hell. Surprisingly for a small and simple game like this, it's quite hard to master as there are certain mechanics that are surely there for you to learn. Mechanics? In a game like THIS? Well, each character you play as has their own special ability to hit the ball a certain way. Once you get good at using these abilities, you can really start to think competetively by finding different tactics to knock your opponent out. ( Seriously, I can actually see some sort of competetive gamemode in the future where people can rank up and all that. )  The only problem I have with this game so far is the lack of content. Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE the characters. I just wish there were a lot more to choose from. Same with maps. There's a couple different gamemodes you can play; free for all, team, and strikers ( Which is basically team mode except you don't take damage from the ball and you have to defend your team's 'goal' ). I wish there were more modes, but these modes are already super fun as it is. Other than all that, I feel like it's a solid game. It's definitely a time killer and a fun game to play when you're bored out of your mind.

It's definitely worth picking up if you're playing the single player matches or online 1v1 matches. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely recommend this game. However, if you're looking for the crazy 4 player online matches, chances are you'll be disappointed. This is one of the most laggy games I've ever played when playing with 3 other people, it's entirely unplayable in that respect. In a game like this, where precision means everything, the lagging completely ruins the experience. Other than that, this one's a blast.  EDIT: It has now gotten to the point where even 1 v 1 is too laggy to play. This has to be fixed for me to continue supporting this game.  This is me begging you to fix the lag issues. Please, I love this game, don't make me have to not recommend it....",

Characters have different skills, playstyles, and some cool and goofy personalities. Some hit the ball different angles, some characters jump higher, some lower, some double jump, some climb walls, some ride their skateboard across the roof. It's fun trying out all the characters and seeing which one fits your playstyle. The online match making works great 99% of the time. There are times where it will take a few minutes to match you up with another player but that only happens to me if it's really late in my time zone. Any other time I can find a match within seconds. The soundtrack is awesome all around. I have my favorite stages but overall all of them have great music. Not to mention some of the stages are different in size so it affects your playstyle and forces you to adapt. There is a practice mode where you can improve on your timing and you can also play againt the computer and adjust the difficulty level. There is also an arcade challenge mode. This is a mode where you fight through all the other characters with a final boss battle. It's not very challenging but it's nice to do once. There are different modes (free for all, strikers, and teams) Strikers is trying to hit a target on the opponents side. Everyone online plays free for all but it's good to have the other game modes as options to play with your friends. What I love the most about this game is how intense games can get when the ball is going super fast. Very satisfying moments when you win those fast paced battles.   There is not much I dislike about this game. I would like to see a few more characters added. I would also want to be able to set the online games to different modes. Everyone online plays free for all which is the funnest game mode in my opinion, but it would be nice to do some 2 vs 2 online with random people. Once in a while there's lag but its rare and most likely due to one of the players internet connection being bad. Game has crashed a few times but I wouldn't call it a problem. It's happened just a few times in the many hours I've played.  Recommendation: Buy at full price. If you like ping pong, if you like fighting games, if you like intense fast paced gameplay then you'll have fun with this one.  Pros  - Different Characters with varying playstyles and skills  - Easy to learn hard to master  - Intense and fun gameplay  - Different game modes  - Up to 4 players free for all makes for some chaotic games  - GREAT Soundtrack that meshes very well with the game.    Cons  - Wish there were more characters  - Online matchmaking could use more customization",

Online multiplayer is pretty choppy in movement and animation compared to the bot matches/local multiplayer. This didn't really surprise me, but it is pretty bad when the ball gets to the point of 1 frame windows to hit it.

It is, at heart, a fighting game that got confused somewhere along the line and wondered what it would be like if it was Pong. There are a set of characters, each with a unique move set, and their sole method of attack is manipulating a ball so that it hits their opponent. Every hit of the ball makes it faster and, thus, harder to avoid or hit back. Each player has a set of lives, one of which is lost each time they are knocked out by the ball. Once your life counter hits zero, you‚Äôre out, until only one player (or team) remains.   You can read the full review here!  [spiritoftherobot.wordpress.com] ",
