            "review_text": "Being a game collector and having a soft spot for badgers (don't we all??) I just had to pick this title up.  Gameplay is simple but with a ton of levels (140) and the 'puzzles' getting progressively harder, you will soon start scratching your head a little for those perfect scores. Each different colour planet has certain gravity effects (like magnets). The idea is to collect all the stars and land in the portal via one click of the mouse. Easier said then done. ;)  Graphically speaking it's built on unity so easily scales up for higher resolution setups. While the game is built to probably resemble Angry Birds in some ways it most certainly has it's own charm. Controls are simple to match the gameplay so keyboard/mouse work just fine. Click and drag to set your launch arc and acceleration level. The game has a decent electronica based soundtrack and while there is no voiced dialog the 'story' is driven along via lovely artwork done in a comic book style.  Enjoyable little game you have here Wales Interactive. I'm honestly quite surprised.  Maybe wait for a sale but I can recommend this title. Only 5bucks afterall. :)",

For the first time EVER a game unites the thrilling elements of Badgers and Gravity to create a stunningly presented physics-based puzzle game that will take you beyond the realms of possibility, imagination and logic to the star-dusted realm of the GRAVITY BADGERS!  Throw yourself into the planets' gravity, dodge asteroids and unyielding deadly bosses in over a hundred levels of vacuum-filled adventure and danger, all united under a stunning art style reminiscent of all your favourite 80's cartoons complete with a thumping mullet rock soundtrack!  The game has highly addictive physics-based action with 140 challenging levels that will keep bringing you back for more. And if that wasn’t enough it also has five big boss levels including the giant Space Worm, the deadly Doomsphere and five Gravity Badger characters to unlock. Couple this with an amazing soundtrack and awesome graphics; this really makes Gravity Badgers a quality game that you’ll keep coming back to.",

            "review_text": "It feels weird doing this for a game which I've actually gone through and completely beaten/gotten 100% of the achievements for, but I can't really recommend Gravity Badgers.  Gravity Badgers is a simple puzzle game where you choose initial direction and velocity of your character, and then their trajectory will change based off of the type of planets you're near (some attracting, some repelling). You're attempting to direct your character to a warp at the end of the level, optionally picking up 3 items along the way.  It's very simple, and I suppose accomplishes that initial goal well enough, but in a lot of ways it just felt lacking. The character graphics are very static - at times feeling like it's a cut out sheet of a character moving around, but without the graphic design to make it seem like that. A large majority of the levels are actually VERY easy, with a few levels that are extremely finicky - there doesn't seem to be much of a middle ground for a pleasing challenge. And finally, there's boss levels, where your character starts shooting lasers at an enemy while they're going at you, and which has pretty much nothing mechanically which relates to the rest of the game. They feel weird, very out of place, and don't really 'work.'  This is very obviously a budget phone/tablet game, and probably better suited to that medium. If these sorts of games appeal to you, sure, go ahead and pick it up - it's competent enough in its own right, aside from minor other technical issues (a little bit of sloppy edge detection for some of the hazards, primarily), but ultimately the game is pretty rough around its edges. It worked well enough for a mindless distraction while I was also doing another activity (TV, work, etc), but there's not a whole lot there, and I doubt most people would enjoy it.",

            "review_text": "Cute Characters, Decent Music, Virtually Skillless Gameplay. If you like Angry Birds, you might enjoy this, but won't love it. Worth the $0.50 I paid during a sale. NOT worth the full $5.  4/10  The game has a cute look and feel with anthropomorphic badgers flying around in space suits. Music is good and fitting for the setting of space flight. The game falls apart in the gameplay: - When levels aren't stupifyingly simple (aim at the nearest star at max power and instantly win with 3 stars), it's being mindlessly tedious (knowing what to do to win, but trying to find the perfect sweet spot to get 3 stars on first try. This takes no thought or strategy and is mostly just memorizing your last move and using trial and error at its most pointless). - Unlocking new characters is fun, but they all do the same thing. This is a missed opportunity for puzzle solving: Give each badger an ability like boosting in mid flight, igonring a certain color planet's gravity, or can fly through asteroids, etc. - I've got nothing against Angry Birds, but when you launch a bird in that game the terrain changes, making you adjust for your next shot. With this game, if you know where the winning sweet spot is, you win instantly. This kills replayability and makes the game more of a guessing-chore and less of a game.",

            "review_text": "If you liked Angry Birds but found that the aspect of smashing things made it too exciting, then this coma-inducing clone might be up your alley. Gravity Badgers is very literally a version of Angry Birds Space where instead of smashing through structures to pop pigs, you merely need to slingshot from point A to point B. Obstacles and the gravity fields of planets scattered throughout the levels complicate the task, but the same banal trial and error flinging that got you through Angry Birds will get you through Gravity Badgers. If your brain injuries are somehow so severe that you can't handle this menial objective, the game actually allows you to skip the level you're on, provided you're willing to wait long enough for the meter that allows you to perform this function to recharge. To its credit, Gravity Badgers has a ton of levels, but you'll get bored long before you've seen all of the samey content the game has to offer.",
