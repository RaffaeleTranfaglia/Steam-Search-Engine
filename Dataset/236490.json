            "review_text": "Hexodius combines a twin-stick shooter with customization and exploration elements in the form of ship equipment and a world map. Buy ship weapons or upgrades, or find them throughout the world, and equip them on your ship before a level. Weapons are unlocked through collecting energy crystals, a mechanic similar to Gradius (where Hexodius sort of gets its name).  Graphics are well done but nothing amazing, and a lack of diversity between level stages means the game starts to feel the same after time. The sound's well done but there aren't enough music tracks, which makes the stages in the same world feel even more same-y. Haven't tried playing with a mouse and keyboard but I imagine the fine precision of a mouse would make aiming easier. My biggest issue with the game is that it refuses to run at my native res, which means I need to run it in a window. The actual gameplay, however, is quite fun.  At $10 I'd only just recommend this, since it's a quite fun arcade game but the lack of polish really brings it down. At $5 however, it's a steal.",
