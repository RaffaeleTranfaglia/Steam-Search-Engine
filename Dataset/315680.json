            "review_text": "This game contains some instances of good artwork, decent music, tolerable voice acting, and a unique game mechanic. Everything else? Well, let's just say that it's not worth the $9.99 full price and that I'm glad I got this off Humble store for SUPER cheap!  The graphics look dated, the camera and movement controls are frustrating, the intro is brief, but uninformative; the story is vague and unengaging, the dialogue: atrocious.   Actual battle game play seems better suited to tablets and touch devices. Though I had no problem using it, I can see how some people may have had problems drawing spells with speed and accuracy. This game should be made into an iOS and Android app that supports multi-touch.  In general, this feels more like an unfinished idea that needs fleshing out and a graphics overhaul. Great Idea, but not engaging enough, not polished enough, and costs too much.",
