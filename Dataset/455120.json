Yes, the first hour about is scary and fun, but right now there are only two different monsters, and not much else content. If and when the game gets more added I may change my review. As of right now it is very lacking, and is not worth the money until more is added.",

THE ACTUAL GAME IS NOTHING LIKE THE TRAILER!  If a game is good you shouldnt have to make a fake trailer for it....Like, I would actually think the trailer is from an entirely different game if it didnt have that 'monster' in the end of it...thats literally the only thing thats the same in the game (oh, and your obnoxiously loud footsteps that for some reason queue behind you).  Refunding the copies I purchased for me and a friend.   Please take your time and watch a youtube video of someone playing, its not at all like what theyre showing you guys.  ",
