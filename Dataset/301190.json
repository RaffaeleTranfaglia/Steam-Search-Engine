You've definitely like this game. Because Frederic: Resurrection of Music is one of a kind indie rhythm games on steam, and its featuring remixes from Frederic Chopin composition in many music genres.   For the gameplay, maybe its too hard to play it on normal. Sometimes too easy is hard too. Because of default key setting in keyboard is near impossible to master. So, change the key bind is recommended. I'll manage to play this game in chopin level with A+S+D+F (Left Hand) and I+O+P (Right Hand) without any problem. So, its 'easy to learn but hard to master' kind of games.  Anyway, this game is one of my favorite games on steam, especially for the brilliant soundtrack.",

The art is really unique. That is the one thing that really drew me to buy this on a whim when I saw it on sale. But there is no way to take a screenshot without skipping to the next scene...!!! It's such a waste.   The story is painfully cliche. But what's really bad is the voice acting. If I had the option, I would have turned it off and just read subtitles. It's pretty bad.  The gameplay itself is very clunky and hard to pick up. The default key bindings make absolutely no sense, and are very cramped. I have tried a bunch of different variations, but nothing has felt comfortable yet. I had to turn the difficulty to easy to play through the game just hoping to get the feel for it. Also, the feedbck for a correct or incorrectly hit key is hard to follow, so when I play I have trouble discerning the mistakes I'm making.  The music, is great. I cannot complain about that, and I can see the pure potential this game has but awkward gameplay and story makes it hard to really feel like this is worth reccomending to someone.   The game is unique, and I wouldn't say it's awful, but i didn't find playing it fun. I'd rather just pick up sheet music for chopin and play the piano.",

I think if I had a touch screen I would be able to get the keys down better, but with a keyboard everything seems so cramped. I even moved the input keys around to better suit my play style, still didn't help. I really wanted a finger finger revolution game, (Stop thinking dirty!) but I guess this isn't what I was looking for. If you don't mind hitting a lot of sour notes, and I mean a lot, then this game is alright, especially for the price of 60 cents. The main character Frederic Chopin reminds me of a dirty Van Helsing.",

            "review_text": "Now this game right here is bulls h i t.  And I mean it.  Wait, stop, don't go away yet, PLEASE, I didn't mean to call it sh i t literally.  What we got right here is a decent rhythm game with some neat art and music. Ever heard of o2jam or osu!mania? You probably gonna like it then. You didn't? It's worth it anyway, and I'll tell you why.  The plot and voiceacting is bad. And I mean, B A D.  Bad to the point it breaks the bottom of the scale and pops up on the opposite side. Took me two hours to beat it, about half of which consisted of animated comics with some sweetest art, worst voiceacting and silliest script I've seen in a while.  NOT TO MENTION THIS GAME IS HIGHLY EDUCATIONAL:  Did you know that every time you, as the grand composer Chopin, release a new masterpiece, a rasta at the carribean gets mentally traumatized during childhood and has problems pulling chicks for the following 30 years? You do now.  Wanna know what happens when two classic composers battle? They make to fall asleep the ♥♥♥♥ out of each other to see whose skills are truly divine.  Oh, and of course, I wouldn't have ever guessed by myself, but judging by the accent, Chopin was British, despite his Polish origins.  All that combined gonna send you into emotional state where you're gonna do nothing but giggle, wonder what the actual f u ck is going on, giggle again, enquire if this s h it is legit, giggle, repeat. Or, if you're here just to fullcombo the ♥♥♥♥ out of the notes, you could just skip it all and jump straight to action. Missing the whole fun part, of course.  OVERALL RATING: CHOPEN OUT OF TEN, WOULD RISE FROM THE GRAVE TO MOCK MASTERMIND X ABOUT HIS PIGGY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.  P.S.: Oh, there's actually a sequel to this. I know where I'm spending next couple hours, folks.",

            "review_text": "Okay, my very first game review on steam, thought it would be a shmup...  (There might be spoilers below, so proceed with pre-cautions)  FredericROM is a very straight forward note-falling rhythm game, although the game has distorted the track a little bit, you'll soon feel home in this game if you're already familiar with any titles in this genre(O2jam, Beatmania IIDX, etc). Just get used to the way the notes coming towards you it'll be all fine.  The basic accuracy judgement of this game is quite forgiving, the way I feel it, the sweet spot lasts longer than the IIDX's 'perfect great', which should give newcomers more confidence on it. However, in pursuing higher score, the random golden notes are a distraction for sure, in my opinion this isn't a good way to raise difficulty.   The content of the game is good enough, at least for a sale price.(I pick it up for less than $2, really can't blame it) More than 10 remastered classical pieces can make your coins count, and they sounds fair. As for the story, I'll say it's simple and encouraging, but I'd prefer to leave it to you to dig up more.  This game has touch screen support which is nice. If you have a x86-based windows 8 tablet(not RT), try it out. I guess playing it on a touch screen would be similar to Konami's ReflecBeat.  Wrapping it up I would give this game a 8 out of 10. Solid game, but it can do better in replayability, and obviously needs more titles to play: this is the very soul of this genre.",

It is extremely short and the story is entirely goof ball, cheesy, with some good-natured humour (though not everyone will agree). While the voice-acting/dialogue/story may fall short for some, I found it cute and amusing with wonderful hand-drawn graphics just enough there for me to want to play through the finger-twisting, eye-crossing game. However, what you'll really be buying this for is the soundtrack which is most certainly worth it to me; if you see it on sale, don't miss it!",
