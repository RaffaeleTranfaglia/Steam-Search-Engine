            "review_text": "Soon I'm sure you'll see a flood of reviews, highlighting the best and worst MechWarrior and Pirrana Games has to offer. On one hand, you'll have people who have played this game for three years and have never had a problem with it. On the other, you'll have people who have felt burned, rightfully so, and still have residual resentment for it. I want to be a slightly more moderate voice, and try my best to review the game as I see it.  I want to start, by saying I find the game fun, and I've been playing it on and off for three years. It's a very niche game, even if it didn't have giant stompy robots which is a niche genre all itself, it's 'a thinking man's shooter' which takes a more slow, methodical approach to First Person Shooters. Because of this, it offers a very unique experience which, if you like that sort of thing like I do, it's very hard to find another game that quite scratches the same itch.   The game is Free to Play in the same sort of way that Ketchup is a vegetable, it's technically accurate for some value of the term. For the most part, at it's best, the game is Pay2NotGrind and Pay4Vanity. At it's worst, however, you have things like the Stalker Hero 'Misery,' a $30 dollar reasonably solid 'meta' mech that is only available with cash money.  Which is actually the real bulk of the problem, the pricing for the game is very, very high for very little. You can take a look for yourself at the 'DLC' on this page - each of those Performance Packs are for two mechs, which - minus a boost to the earnable in-game currency - are identical to their earnable with in-game currency counterparts. I'm sure you'll hear about the $500 gold mech packages they offered a year ago, ( technically, still are offering from a year ago ) but that really is a extreme, argueably not entirely PGIs fault since they were still under IGP at the time, and I'd like to believe everyone involved has learned their lession and will never do anything like it again ( although, like I said, the offer is still available. ) The more consistant reality of it is somewhere around $20-30 for a mech, which is still fairly high.  The good news is, for the most part, nearly all mechs become available with the earnable in-game currency some months after they're released to people who first 'pre-ordered' the mechs in early access packs, and after they're released to people for cash money. ( Pay2NotWait? ) Usually this isn't a problem although sometimes the mechs are slightly to very OP and unbalance things, making the game unfun for anyone who didn't pre-order. The only real exception to this are 'Hero' mechs which normally are slightly underpowered but gimmicky varriants of a mech, sometimes with ties into lore, but generally aren't the best version of any mech. Usually. There are exceptions.   A lot of the residual resentment I mentioned earlier stems from the previous tendency to remain close-lipped about the direction the game was going, to ignore any real community feedback, and a very slow development cycle. Most of these have been improved upon since PGI got out from under IGPs thumb - Development has severely picked up pace and new things besides mech packs have been added to the game fairly frequently. PGI is much more open about what they're doing / what direction they want to move the game into. Feedback from what I've seen is still somewhat spotty, although from my understanding they decided to not go through with 'ghost damage,' a mechanic that was nearly universally hated - where in the past they would have just gone through and added it anyway ( looking at you 3rd Person and Ghost Heat ) - so, I suppose that too is improving.   Overall, since I need to select Yes or No to 'Do you recommend this game?' I have to say no.  I like the game, I find it fun, but that doens't make it a good game by default. Between shaking off the ghost of IGP past, elements from three years ago which still feel unfinished ( mostly looking at Community Warfare here, which while 'still in beta' has been worked on since launch ) and a high cost of premium elements ... It's just not a good game for the everyman.   Added onto the fact that even if this game was perfect, it would still be kind of a niche game - and some people would just not be able to get into it - it makes those flaws even more hard to overlook when considering a binary 'Yes or No' answer.  I would, however, suggest that if you think you might be able to get into it - to at least give it a try and find out. Don't spend any money on it until you're sure you like it, but if you do - like I said, it's a fairly unique experience and hard to find games quite like it.  Small, Edit :   Everything up until this point is aimed for potential new players, not members of the prexisting userbase. I don't need to explain what's good or bad with the game to you, you already know and have your own opinions, and that's fine, you're more then welcome to make your own review or tell me what you agree or disagree about mine - conversation is good.  But, this, and only this is specifically for the prexisting userbase - I understand you like this game, I understand being critical of things you enjoy can be hard, but be a little respectful, would you? If you're so concerned about one negative review turning people away then how do you think they're going to react when they read the comment section?",

            "review_text": "As a new player, I think MWO is great. And as a new player I notice that this game gets a lot of hate for the product it used to be, rather than what it is.  As it stands, the game is generally very stable. I've been disconnected twice at the time of writing this and once was because of an earthquake at their server locations. It's a deep, tactical shooter with a lot of customization available. If you value positioning, constant map reassessment, tactics, and precision over snap accuracy then you should try MWO.  The F2P model is reasonable enough, and the game is not P2W. Within the first couple dozen games, anyone can afford a top tier mech layout. I don't know if MWO is going to continue with the frequent events they've been doing, but with them the grind is much less noticable with things like mech credits (paid currency), c-bills (in game currency), and premium time all being given out for free. I'd actually say the rate at which you get new stuff is about right with these events, so it may be too slow without them.  There is a little bit of an extra grind to get to the top which is with modules. Modules require global XP to learn the skills to use them and the modules cost a lot of c-bills (like as much as a new mech without being outfitted). Because of the ELO system in the game, Pilot Skill Rating (PSR), you won't really being playing against people with this gear in quick play. You will, however, be playing against these people in Community Warfare (CW).  CW is a fun mode that's a nice alternative to quickplay as the objectives are no longer symmetrical. It's meant to act as the global scale war that fits in with the lore of MechWarrior. It's not fully fleshed out yet though, and the main benefit for participating is ranking up with the various factions which do have some unique rewards. But the feeling of making a true impact isn't there yet. It's also not completely balanced between the factions.  Customer service has been good so far. I had an account issue that they resolved quickly, even with the holiday hours.  Bottom line: MWO is fun to play, offers a good freemium model, and the company seems to have changed their mentality in running this game for the better.",

            "review_text": "This is the MechWarrior game I've been wanting since my childhood days playing MechWarrior 2. So how to describe it compared to other games? Well, it's not exactly a shooter and it's not exactly a sim. It's somewhere in between. The F2P setup is actually reasonable which is a rare thing to see, especially after my experience with World of Tanks and World of Warships and the obvious money sinks built into those. With MWO throwing money gets you nothing gameplay related that you couldn't get otherwise for free.   Yes you can get cosmetic stuff, yes you can get first access to new mechs for a bit before they're available to earn for in-game currency, and yes you can buy 'hero' mechs that give a little boost to XP earned, but little Billy with his daddy's credit card is going to get wrecked because cash won't do anything but save you time in unlocking things.  Other than that, there's events for unlocking free stuff that happen on a very regular basis, and the community is actually full of (mostly) decent folks who just want to have fun blasting the crap out of each other in giant stompy robots.",

            "review_text": "I've played MWO since closed Beta, over 3 years, and I love it. After playing for all this time, I can easily say that MWO has had better staying power than nearly any other computer game I've ever played. I also, for the most part, like the MWO community. I've met some great friends and have a lot of fun playing with them. Although, you don't have to join a group to have fun. I've had hundreds of great games playing solo.  The ability to customize your mech to fit your chosen game style is great. Scout, brawler, sniper, missile boat, leader or follower. Fast mechs, slow mechs, big mechs or small mechs. Lasers, canons, missiles, or support roles like NARC, ECM, and tag. The game has some real depth to it, and the developers continually work to make it better. My experience with the support team has been good (and I really have had to work with them on some connection issues).   It's not like most shooters, where your life span is measured in seconds. In games like Halo and COD, I always disliked that the average life span seemed to be 10 seconds or less. In MWO you can live for several minutes while taking fire and get into some insane brawls with opposing mechs. Minor mistakes can be overcome (provided your mistake isn't walking smack into the middle of the opposing team) and you can really make a difference to your side's success even after half your mech is blown off.  Having said that, the game does have a learning curve. There can be real depth to the gameplay. Teamwork is very key. You have to watch your position relative to your team, your enemy, and the map itself. Some locations on the maps are better than others, and you'll have to discover them. You have to pay attention to your heat, your mechs armor and internal structure, your weapon status, and to be a good player you also have to pay close attention to your opponents status and aim with precision at where they are weakest; all the while maneuvering as best you can to absorb incoming fire while delivering your own.   The tutorial is pretty good and a must for new players. Several of the existing player groups will also welcome new players and help you learn. I know mine will. If you can, get into one of the teamspeak rooms and ask around, or look at the gaming fourms in the faction groups. Most players are helpful in answering honest questions.   I would recommend premium time at a minimum if you're serious about playing. The 50% boost to Cbills and expierence really add a great deal over time and let you customize your mechs in a relatively short time. I would also recommend you find what kind of mech you like and then give a Hero Mech a try. The Hero Mechs give Cbill and experience bonuses that stack with the premium time. Make money with a Hero Mech and you can purchase and kit out your garage nicely without having to pay a dime more. I have way over a hundred mechs, and most of them were purchased for free, with Cbills earned in the game (or even given away by the developers during special weekend events!).  Of course, some mechs are better than others, and there's always going to be 'meta' mechs and builds that are at the top, but the developers really have done a pretty good job of balancing the mechs. The game is definitely NOT pay to win. The Hero Mechs and Premium time ease the grind, but they are not an 'I win button.' I love that it doesn't matter so much if you are in a light, heavy, or assault mech, if you are a good pilot and play it right, you can beat your opponent regardless of what they are driving. So long as you don't take yourself too seriously (remember, it's a game!) you can have fun with all of the mechs, and there are a ton of them to choose from.  So what don't I like? I wish the game had better visuals and sound effects for internal ammo explosions (basically the MWO version of a critical hit where ammunication inside a mech starts to explode). I wish some of the original iconic mechs, like the capapult, looked and played like they did in closed Beta (give me back that torso twist and the monster PPC barrels!). I also wish that scouting and support roles gave more rewards than they do now. Oh, and I hate how the gauss rifle works. Other than that, I'd say I'm extremely satisfied in my experience with the game.  One other point to add is that this game is pretty sanitary for a young person if you are a parent and concerned about your kids watching and/or playing violent games. There's no blood; no humans with guns killing other humans with guns (or worse). It's giant stompy robots blowing up other giant stompy robots, so the sense of human on human violence is much less than other first person shooters.  So, if you like first person shooters and are looking for a game with great gameplay, good graphics and more than the ten second life-span of HALO and COD, the game is one you should give a chance. It's free to try, so you have nothing to lose, and alot to gain. Good luck, and see you in the next drop!",

No structures to resupply/repair/DESTROY, no military vehicles or aircraft, but you can pay to get a one use artillery strike The powercreep is growing exponentially Coolant is a consumable item.

The basic mechanics had the potential to be a decent mw experience, but it's all buried under layers of ''balanced matchmaking esports fp2 experience''. It is another example of a good idea ruined by the freemium standars, and like all the f2p games following these standars, it took all the money it could and started to lose playerbase quickly  There are alternatives to this game if you feel the need to pilot a giant mech. Mechwarrior living legends for example, even if it's still unpolished, is what this game should've been and it was accomplished by a small team.

The ability to specifically target different components to destroy or disable a mech is absolutely brilliantly done *The building of mechs. You can totally customise every single mech to your playstyle and liking *Balance. This game was horribly unbalanced between Clan Mechs and IS for a long time, but its better than it has ever been before currently *Strategy and teamwork. This game rewards intelligence and teamwork over quick reflexes and lone wolfing.  The things I think could use some work are: *Maps. I'd like to see more maps *Community Warfare. Currently is too complicated and takes too long to find a game for casuals *The graphics. Some parts of the game look great, some like dire. Needs more polish overall. *There are still some terrible bugs that need fixing (like the stairs on Viridian bog)  But overall, the game is great fun, and probably my most consistantly played game of the last few years.

Once I got back into my old account I was given a crap ton of C-Bills and some achievements so that was a good start. I owned 3 Hunchbacks because I like Hunchback and I decided to trick one out with a build I found online. I developed a long term plan and have been sticking with it. I die alot but I got all my Hunchbacks to elite and I am making my way to Master, that was the plan. I have yet to get any in game currency and don't own any special mechs.

The graphics and sound are decent, and it is a good foundation on which a great game could have been built, but wasn't. Essentially the game is just an arena combat game using mechs - there is a Community Warfare mode which seems very unpopular, but really the game is just deathmatch.   Having played on and off since the original Beta, I can't help but feel that if the developers had put a little more effort into fleshing the game out with a bit more depth and variety it could have been so much more. Essentially the game we have now is little more than the core functionality upon which a game world could have been constructed. Calling it an MMO in its current form is pretty funny really, as there's only the skimpiest of metagames or player interaction.   This would be fine for a simple FTP game, but as the inheritor of one of Sci-Fi's finest (if cheesiest) franchises, and bearing in mind the frankly incredible amounts of real money demanded for Mechs, it's just not enough. In addition the rich lore and background of the Battletech universe has been largely ignored or contradicted when large parts of it could have been exploited much more cleverly.  In my view the IP should never have been given to these developers (or indeed their even shadier former publishers) and I'm afraid it seems that they just weren't up to the job of turning out a solid game that's worth the money that so many have already spent on it.",

MechWarrior Online is definately a game worth trying simply because it is free. But be warned: the game is very grindy and difficult. Matches will seem unfair to someone new. This game is slow paced, which is different from other shooters.  This game is also very niche. Even if the game was perfect, most will not like it because it's only fun for certain people.  The main issue this game faces is the grindy nature of the game. You will spend a lot of time playing to get the end game stuff, which is acceptable. However, you have to specialize in a mech (buying three varients of the same mech) in order to get high-level 'masteries.' If you make the wrong choice, you could find that you just wasted millions of C-Bills (in-game currency) trying to play.  Real-money prices are also high. So expect to drop serious coin if you want a small advantage. Like with everything in this game, you have to educate yourself before you buy. You might not like that sweet mech you just spent 10 dollars for. Personally, I don't mind throwing a little money here and there to stack up my real-money currency, because it adds up fast. To cut on the grind, you can throw some money for an XP and C-bill boost, which is nice and adds 50% to all earnings. Certain mechs that cost real money also carry a XP or C-BIll bonus when using them. You could be earning upwards to 70% extra money and XP due to these mechs.  Overall, try this game out.

            "review_text": "I have been playing MechWarrior Online since closed beta (summer 2012) and have to say that this is one of the most gratifying and addictive games... once you climb the learning curve. The gameplay is unique in that you can customize your 'Mechs with a very wide variety of weapons. There are no re-spawns in 2 of the 3 game modes, which forces you to play smart rather than run and gun, like most FPS games. It can be frustrating to die in the first few minutes of a game (solo and group queue matches are a maximum 15 minutes, but usually average about 10 minutes, while Community Warfare matches typically last 20-30 mins).  If you are an FPS gamer, you will appreciate the higher level of tactical play and it rewards good aim and movement. In fact, the component/hitbox design of the 'Mechs really rewards players who have precision aiming. Headshots (cockpit kills) are extremely difficult, but highly satisfying in this game... more so than any other FPS I have played.  There are 4 weight classes of'Mechs, ranging from Light through to Assault, and offer you different roles to play within a team and changes your playstyle. Some people specialize in one or 2 roles/weight classes because it suits their playstyle and others are flex players who like variety.  Team Damage: Yes, it is a real thing and it is annoying as hell to be on the receiving end from trolls (which are few and far between, I might add). Thankfully, you can monitor your team damage at the end of round info screen. Do keep your firing lanes clear and apologize to your teammates if you accidentally shoot them in the back (where there is MUCH less armour and can destroy weapons or even kill them in one full volley of your weapons if placed in one spot). If you are tabbed out of the game and click back in with your mouse, you will fire your weapons, so please alt-tab back into the game instead.  Interface: The out of game user interface in the game has changed a lot over the past couple of years and it still isn't perfect, but it MUCH better than older ones. The lack of customizable UI is understandable, due to the sheer volume of parts that make up the info needed and it still can't all fit on one screen. This is a game that is very complex when played to its fullest potential, yet offers instant action once you become familiar with the ideal builds for each 'Mech. Expect to spend a lot of time initially tinkering with Mechs and unlocking skills and items (modules that enhance your weapons, movement or ability to gather info). The in-game interface is pretty cool and has recently introducted additional info within the cockpit (you can also play in 3rd person view, but it highly affects your aiming for precision shots and people can see you are in 3PV because a drone flies above your Mech... you may get a bit flamed for it, as it can also be a visual cheat due to terrain design).  Team-Play/Communications: As with any team-based game, you are highly recommended to find a unit and utilize voice comms, but you can play strictly in the solo queue to build your experience, level up your 'Mechs (skill trees take about 30-40 matches to complete for one Mech chassis), or experiment with different weapon loadouts and heat management. Voice comms are available in game, but not used by everyone. You can mute annoying players quite easily. Clans, House Units or Merc Units (aka guilds) are constantly looking for players and have their tag displayed in game next to their name. If you start to see players with a given tag and like your cohesion (and win rate!) with them, I advise you find out their voice comms info and play with them in a group. Just request to join them in chat or add them as a friend and use the in-game messaging feature.  Heat?: Ah yes, heat management... this is a layer of complexity that requires you to really be aware of your heat production caused by weapon use and movement. Learning to squeeze out the most of your Mech takes a lot of time and understanding, but there are some great community resources out there. You eventually can do it by feel, but there are visual and audio cues to help. Overheating causes damage to your internals and you can even blow yourself up by riding in the red too long. In those last ditch attempts to squeeze off a final kill, you can choose to override your auto shutdown when past 100%, but do so wisely! Suiciding due to overheat can still reward the kill to a player shooting at you.  Community: there are always toxic players or trolls, but you will find an overall very nurturing community. The game is no doubt a niche game, but has a very, very loyal following with some very big whales who love the BattleTech universe. There is no other multiplayer game on the market quite like this one and it induces a lot of passion within the MWO forums and MWO sub-reddits.  eSports: There is a budding attempt to turn MWO into an eSport with a $100K prize pool world tournament starting in Q1 2016. Those in the competitive-minded community hope that enough new players with great skills enter MWO to spawn new teams or revive some old ones that have felt that the competitive scene is stale. Most competitive play is accomplished via community-run leagues (MRBC, RHoD, and a few 8/12/16 team invitationals). The publisher did host one official beta tournament, which brought out a lot of new names to the competitive scene and we hope that will be the case in the near future with the influx of new players from Steam.  Pay Model: The game is F2P and used to be very limited in this regard, but has opened up widely since Community Warfare started. Initially you begin with 4 Mech Bays. You had to buy additional ones in the past, but now you can earn them through in-game rewards and special events. There are some Hero and Champion Mechs that are only purchasable with real money (MC), but they are not mandatory to buy. They do offer enhanced XP or C-Bill (in-game currency) bonuses, so it can be a good way to farm cash to buy additional 'Mechs. As with most F2P games, you will end up paying more for this game than a retail box model should you get into it... and there is nothing wrong with that at all! Mech Packs are pricey, but it is more of a pay to early access feature rather than a Pay 2 Play/Win model. There are only a few Hero Mechs that you may want to buy should you wish to get into competitive play. Wait for paid items to go on sale at 50% off to get the best value, which happens often.  Matchmaking: There are 5 skill tiers and that is how the base matchmaker tries to pair up players. Sometimes you will be matched with players a tier higher or lower, but the idea is that both sides are matched as evenly as possible. There are also weight and chassis limits per side, so as to maintain some degree of balance of teams. The past saw some issues with queue times due to lower populations, which has been less of an issue since Steam release. However, the Community Warfare (CW) mode still suffers from a lack of popluation due to lack of real incentives to play that game mode vs time per match. We hope that an increased CW population will reduce the wait times and increases the potential of this game mode. More on CW below.  End Game: Community Warfare is the persistent universe game mode and is not based on any matchmaking at all, but a specific weight tolerance of the 4 Mechs you can bring to each match. Yes, this is the only game mode where you have respawns, but you still need to use each Mech wisely, as matches are more prolonged with different phases to the fight. There is a defense and an offense mode to each map and new game modes are going to be introduced to increase playability of CW during off-peak times. Here is where you can unlock in-game rewards and also earn MC, the real money currency that can unlock more Mech Bays (character slots, per say), cosmetic items, or even Champion or Hero Mechs, if you grind it out.",

            "review_text": "Let's start simple. Try the game for yourself. I can only tell you that my experience with this game since 2012 has been good. That is my experience alone but you can make up your mind by trying it yourself.  Play the 25 matches for the in game currency to see if you truly like the game or not.  _______  Let's break this down into several components. Gameplay, UI, Graphics, Content, End Game.  Gameplay 8/10: This game down to its core is a very fun game when you play it and learn it. Its an action shooter but it doesn't have the cartoon speed of some other FPS where you die after stubbing your toe on a bullet. No you can take a hit and if you are smart can survive for as long as you can. There's a sense of tactics in there somewhere. It's knowing when to attack, when to retreat, when to work with your team. You don't just run and gun and respawn.  That is just half the game to launch into a match though. The second half is to make and create your own mech builds. To be able to tinker and change a chassis to how you want to play and not some stock loadout. To own and change every mech that you can get. To collect and master all the mechs you want provided you get the mechbays you need.  It isn't perfect, balance could be better in regards to lesser used weapons. There could be more balance between the two major 'Factions' the Clans and the Inner Sphere.  Overall it feels like a fun game to play,  UI 7/10: The first incarnation was terrible, the second incarnation horrific, and now we have this current '2.5' UI that has honestly been a success. There's a lot of clicking but in comparison to other games like say Armoured Warfare it isn't actually as bad as it use to be. A lot of information that needs to be presented to you is but there is room for improvement which will come.  What the game needs? UI Tooltips when you work in the Mechlab. UI for Mech Modules (Extra addons for mechs), and just quality of life improvements.  Overall the UI is not special but its not terrible.  Graphics 8/10: Mechwarrior: Online is showing its age. It runs on a outdated engine that has high demands for less gains. We've seen the power and scale of CryEngine 3 as a FPS but it demands much more when you see 12 vs 12 Giant mechs that take up a lot more power to render. The graphics are however still quite amazing. The visuals of seeing your lasers, cannons, and missiles fire is amazing. You won't be disappointed by all the effects.  However you would want optimizations out of this game. It definitely needs to be optimized across the board.  Overall its a great visual overall but it isn't the type of visuals you would expect from some triple AAA title which you shouldn't anyways.  Content 8/10: In my opinion the story is not rich but the lore behind it is. It leads into having a lot of room for content in the future. It already has hundreds of mechs to choose from which is the meat of the content. There's so much room for variety that it provides so much content already. Could it have more than just mechs? Yes.  I want to see more than just PvP Matches. It lacks in content that isn't just PvP.  Overall its still good but that leads into the last component.  End Game 5/10: The end game is unfinished. Plain and Simple it is not done. It is an interesting Idea of a moving world but it just seems like a map and place to fight right now.  The future looks bright for it with new modes of play, the ability to use guild/faction/unit money to buy things with but its not there yet. _________  Overall this game is 7.5/10 until more patches come out. I have some faith but it needs to be proven at this point.",

This discouraged me quite a bit until I decided to play just recently. And I have to say, they have fixed this massive issue from my experience so far.  This game sets you in the seat of any one of dozens of building-sized mechs (with variations for every appetite of carnage) as it pits you against one another in a thought-provoking strategy. Run&amp;Gunners will not like this game, outright, to be successful you need to utilize what you can with your team and weigh strategies. A single mech can turn the tide of battle depending on the game type and the strategy employed.  PROS: -High on the thought-provoking based gameplay. (Moves/actions/assaults require tactics) -Built-in Voice to assist with this -The mech choices feel endless and nearly every style of 'approach' can be found in at least one mech -Weapon balance is very sold, something you expect from a MW game -Builds for any mech can keep even veteran tinkerers happy -Maps have variety (even if people only choose a few maps) -The game feels organic and very immersive as you are set in the cockpit of a 30-100 ton war machine -The smallest mechs have strategies to employ against the largest, and vice versa. Not one mech can truly reign as 'king of mechs'  CONS: -New players will feel overwhelmed with the amount of options and how to actually build/load a mech -The tutorial is nice but not as extensive as the game itself -There is no 'try before you buy' unless your mech of choice happens to be in the weekly(?) trial mech line-up -EXP gain and Credits gain after your first few battles feels molasses in January slow -Game requirements may be high for some older PC's  Overall the gameplay is as solid as titanium with a few flaws in regard to resource income. Good visuals, good gameplay, and the community is actually quite friendly for a team-based competitive game. Let's just say I'd rather meet with MWO folk than LoL/DOTA2 folk any day of the week.

            "review_text": "Ummmm Yeah... This is Bill Lumbar reporting in for my first review of MWO.   I started playing MWO around 2 years ago. I have always been a fan of the BT table top, grew up playing it as a child and young adult. 38 now, and through the years I have played many of the BT games on sega, super Nes, playstation, xbox and pc to name a few. I used to head up to chicago to the BT center as a kid with my dad to get my fix.   Life took over and I found myself not playing BT games anymore, and for years. I got that hunger again around two years ago and googled new BT games. First hit I got was MWLL and I happened to have the old Cyris game so I was all set. Jumped right in and I loved it... then bam! MWLL got shut down/they stopped developing it. I then read the rumors surrounding the 'why' and came across MWO and downloaded it and started playing it more then I would like to admit. For a solid 6 months, I dropped over 6000+ matches. Within the last two plus years I have spent around $90 dollars on this game between two accounts, one IS, and the other straight Clan.   This game has faults..... that is for sure. One of the two biggest issues for me has always been the painful 'grind' and snails pace one progresses at in this game, even when spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on it. Thankfully, right before the Steam release... PGI decided after 2 plus years of very low ingame earnings to increase the C-bill and XP earnings. I don't believe its where it needs to be, but it is up around 15-25% of what we all used to make per match. I wanted and felt a 50% increase was long over due, but hey its a start.   Secondly, Prices for everything in this game besides Mechbays are pretty much crack priced. How they unlock camo, patterns, and colors is just insane for the price. All the bling for the cockpits, prices are pretty much insane IMO.   Third game lacks serious content and depth. It needs so much more, and it has been screaming for more for a very long time!   Now to the good things, Core game play is fun. I am looking for more of a sim type game when it comes to BT... because I like to build sim pits... I love BT... and I hope they keep it moving more towards that style of play in this game. for what ever faults this game does have, PGI has come a long way with this game.   I took a several month vaction from this game... going from playing around 100-200 matches a week, to only 5 matches a week. The last 3 months I have just got back into playing this game and am back up to maybe 30-50 matches a week. This was mostly to do with PGI ignoring the pleas of many on the forums/forum warriors that earnings needed to be brought up so this game didn't feel like a snails pace. Even with PT it still felt very slow, making not buying PT a no brainer.   All in all I would recommend this game to others, core game play is fun.... and I have met some really cool people in game. The forums are a trip some times... much hate...but there is also a lot of love out there and some really cool people that love to help and also even share/give aways. One piece of advice...spend wisely, and don't go on a crack spending spree....seriously, its not worth it IMO. If you have the dollars to do that and want a place to blow them, by all means, knock yourself out. Plenty to blow money on in this game...golden mechs.... you name it, PGI will sell it!",

One that has the look/feel of a complete pay to play game. That being the case I won't say - no, I don't recommend it.   Instead I will say don't get into this free to play game expecting great things. As some reviewers have mentioned the grind is real. I don't really care about comparisons of other games and how much you have to grind on them to get anywhere. From my personal experience I have probably in the neighborhood of 75 hours into this game. I also have well over $80 into this game. If the cost of MC is the same it has been for a couple years then I have $95 into the game. So that's nearly 80 hours and $95... Know what I have? Ten mechs currently. I believe I have sold one that I decided I'd never use again, and it was a mech that I had won. Also one of the mechs I currently have I won as well. Three of the mechs I have I bought with real money essentially. So that means I've been able to afford to buy six mechs in the game with nearly 80 hours worth of grinding. And this includes using 'Hero' mechs that net you more c-bills per match.   If you spend real money on this game know that the 'value' simply will not be there. I have never spent $95 on a single stand alone game. A full copy of a game, then DLC that comes out later, yes. But $95 for a game that completely lacks any kind of story mode, only allows for online multiplayer and last I knew in order to 'host' a game yourself with buddies that cost real money.   Bottom line is if you put any kind of money into the game you're essentially paying for - at best half a game depending on how you want to look at it. Because real money doesn't even come close to unlocking or allowing one to use all of the mechs in the game. Worst case scenario dropping $50 on the game has the potential to allow you to play with... 5% of the game, at best? I think that's pretty fair. And if you're one those that doesn't spend any money on the game be prepared for some major grinding. And if the grind wasn't bad enough the game becomes very monotonous because of the underwhemling gameplay.",

I also played ALL the previous iterations of this franchise, going all the way back to the beginning. For what it's worth. I have played in well over 5000 drops, own 200+ mechs.  On to the game itself.  Oh I have spent money, but mostly, because I wanted to, I buy mech bays, and premium time mostly and up until recently every mech pack they sold. I took a small hiatus from purchasing packs until some game issues were resolved, I did not stop playing, not even a little, but I voted with my wallet for a while :).  The game is fun, it's fast paced, and it requires you to think about what you are doing at all times, stop for a minute to look around, and you might be dead. There is a unique variance in how you play based on the type of mech you bring in the game, light, medium, heavy, assault. You can play the game as a solo participant or as a group participant, here is the divide, teamwork is OP, and always will be in a game that boasts a 12v12 atmosphere.  Many people are reviewing this game, and many giove it negative reviews, mostly, because they are now, or at least were at some point, very passionate about this game, this is the common theme you will in reviews on steam for MWO, passion, it makes for a diverse and interesting commentary on how this game effects the people who play it. Many people come and go, some say the 'best' players have gone on to other games, tired of waiting for changes, and that may be true to an extent, though there are many current players that would argue the point :).  Try the game, see for yourself, if you like shooters, this is the ultimate one, the diversity in how you kit out your mech is completely astounding, you have tons (literally) to play with, as I noted above I have 200+ mechs, and each one can have almost unlimited different configurations, just this alone is worth hours of ones time, mech lab is the game within the game, who can build the best robot? who is going to set the next 'meta' ? no one knows for sure. There are so many resources and established units within the game, you won't be alone for long if you want to play with people, use HPGoutreach on reddit for many good guides, even though sometimes you need a salt filter in there, this is normal, and there are good people that simply will help you for nothing. If you want fierce competition and are willing to put in time, the competitive scene is pretty serious, you can get lost in tactics and builds and, well all the things.......  one thing, always have fun when you play, try new things, run through the new tutorials, they are very good! play the trial mechs, they arent bad. You will start with others who have not played vis a vis the newish tier system implemented, you start at tier 5 and walk your way up to tier 1, tier 1 is pretty broad in scope, but be ready to play if you get there!!! some people do not miss, almost ever :) take your time in tier 5 and see what you like to do, shoot some stompy robots.  If you see me in game, say Hi, my in game name is the same as here, and I will be happy to help however I can.  come play my favorite game of all time, you might get hooked, you might hate it :) but it's free so why would you not try, I bet most will like it, who does not want to shoot giant stompy robots after all :)  Never mind the occasional jerk in game, rats gonna rat, ask questions, have fun...",

Situational awareness is more of a strength for me than being a good shot. I found myself being good enough in the Assualt Class mechs while still enjoying every other class of mechs. I find some Mechs to be higher skill mechs than others. I know Pilots that you give one small laser and a high skill Mech (need skills to hit with or stay alive)and they get massive damage done, a bunch of assists and a couple kills. That is not me in any way.   This game caters to each individuals play style and differenciates everyones skill levels. Each pilot can build a mech that hightens skills or hides the lack thereof. My builds hide my lack of skill shooting while taking advantage of my abilty to know where the enemy is or is moving to, in a brawl, in a flank, or smashing down on my team.   I am better than I was, but you long time Steam players start with more skill than I will ever have! That said, I like my chances against you. Thinking mans game, and you are a child my friend ( just kidding, almost).  Smash and grab play style, long range sniper, big ballistic crusher, short or long range missle havoc wrecker, or the sneeking little evil back stabbing elite scout light that has the temarity to do such to a Majestic slow moving Assault Mech that rightfully and normally strike fear and apprehension to the enemy, showing it's superiority in almost every way, right? heh heh lol  Anyway, I think this game is great. There is a learning curve some find tough, but every hard core gamer I ever met that stuck with it, they loved it and were too good at it to suit me, unless they were on my team stealing my kills.  Do not use the center torso button as a crutch, get on teamspeak, fix your armour and get double heatsinks. Buy 3 of the same chassis leveling them up on the pilot tree, do not spend a dime on the game if you shouldn't, spend whatever you like if you can.

It is a tactical shooter and rewards a good sense of awareness and the ability to work as a team.  Community Warfare is fun, although there isn't much of a lasting effect of winning or losing a Community Warfare match, but that system is being continuously worked on and there are some big changes being made that will improve the system.

Not to mention the in game movie content as you became deeply involved the more you played.  MechWarrior Online:  I started beta testing this game during the closed beta back in 2012 and still continue to play it since the release date of September 17, 2013. There are a lot of things that I’m not happy about as MWO has evolved as do a lot of other people who play this game. All I can say is don’t get your head stuck in the forums and the negativity see the game for what it is. A constantly evolving and improving online experience as a MechWarrior pilot with the Inner sphere, Clans and Mercenaries. Mech releases are flowing with the in game time line so as the time line progresses more tech and mechs become available. There is a tier based ranking system that let players play with those at their skill level. Very good to help new players get familiar with the game play and tactics. Just remember if you are in a group with players at a higher Tier you will play at that level.  8/10  If community warfare was completed and not still in the beta phase I would probably give it a 9/10 I put this game down for 9months and picked it up again recently and was impressed to see the changes that had happened over that time being new maps, mechs and a graphic overhaul. It’s free and also pay to play, grind your way for C-bills to buy mechs or throw down $100 for 25000 mech credits either way it’s a hell of a game and definitely worth a try.

Paying players also don't have a monopoly advantage either. New mechs might be restricted for MC, but they will soon go on sale for CBills and there are lots of viable mechs. There are also frequent events where you can get MC. The community is one of the most chill and sporting groups I have seen when it comes to competitive games.

Then there's the money needed to buy the mech, and then customize it with the parts you want. After the cadet boost expires after 25 matches, money will be a bit tough to come by, even with the premium boost.   If you don't care too much about customization or progress, there are always 16 trial mechs available for play with 4 for each weight class. Others can use those to figure out what kind of mech they want to purchase and customize with the in-game currency. Some mechs are very expensive, so a trial run is a smart move to not waste money. You start with 4 mech bays and can earn some free ones from Faction play or events.  The sound effects are great. Firing any of the lasers feels and looks good. The same goes for the ballistic weapons. I didn't care too much for the missiles, but if you like firing volleys of them and hearing them blast off into the distance, this game will let you do so.  The damage displayed on the mechs is visually satisfying. I'm a big fan of shooting arms off. Mechs will be covered in bullet holes and damaged metal. They'll walk with limps if one of the legs is destroyed.  Anyhoo, this game can offer a good time. Just make smart purchases and have fun with your builds.

Playing Quick Play over and over again to work out your masteries on a chosen 'Mech is just fun. Your first 20 matches gives you an insane amount of money to buy just about any 'Mech you want, and depending on what class and chassis you pick, you can even get your three variants to achieve mastery.  Here's how not 'grindy' the grind is: I played my first 17 hours and bought three heavy 'Mech variants, and achieved mastery of them without getting bored at all. In fact, every match that I start, every time I click Quick Play, every time the oh-so-familiar 'Mech computer says 'weapons online, sensors online, all systems nominal' I get goosebumps like I'm that kid I was back in 1995 when I first played MechWarrior 2, or when I saved my lunch money instead of buying lunch in middle school so that I could buy MechWarrior 4 in 2000.  There is near limitless fun you can have just jumping in with Quick Play without ever giving PGI a dime. Seriously there is not any reason someone who casually wants to shoot big robots in a walking tank would need to spend money.

And, when I learned that MWO was all PvP, I really wasn’t interested at first. But, the lure of Big Stompy Robots eventually dragged me into trying it.  So, there I was grinding out my twenty five cadet bonus matches in a Trial JM-6 Jagermech. My first mech purchase was a Blackjack as they were first released. I realized that this was a different kind of PvP game- it was slower, the concept of walking tanks did a good job of mitigating the twitch play that I didn’t like. Sure there was still twitch play with light mechs, but it was still a little slower and methodical that other FPS games I played.  Now, a few years (and a bunch of mech packs) later, I find I truly do love this game.  What I like most about this game, compared to other tank games, is the method in which you get your vehicles. See, in other tank games, you have to contend with tech/progression trees- forcing you to drive or fly equipment you don’t like in order to work your way into gear that you do.  Not so with this game. If I want to drive a Timberwolf, I can either grind the CBills to get them, buy the MC to get it or buy it straight away from the gift store. Can’t do that with an M1 Abrams, German Tiger or P-51.  I love how customizable the game is. Much of the fun of the game is spending time in the mechlab finding that perfect build that synergizes my playstyle with the mechs quirks and hardpoint arrangement. See not all build fit all, some build that work great for one guy may not work so well for other. But, finding that great build that works for you is truly satisfying.  Another thing I love about this game is the regular events that PGI holds. Grab bag events, Leaderboard events, Faction play events and Cumulative stretch goal events, there’s always something going on.  There’s a lot of good stuff on the horizon for this game- The fabled Unseens are being released on a monthly basis as we speak. If you’re a Battletech aficionado, you can truly appreciate the return of these classics. PvE is coming; we already see glimpses of PvE in the Mechwarrior Academy. A large update is coming to Faction Warfare that will appeal to small groups (4v4) as well as large.  If you’re new to the game, do check out the Spike Brave tutorials on youtube. Also, play the Mechwarrior Academy, play it a lot, play it some more. The Mechwarrior Acandemy is a great resource.  Give the game its fair shake, just like I did, and I think you will be impressed with it, just like I am.",

They have a new tutorial which teacher you mmuch needed info but still not enough to just thrust you into hell. I had played this game before it came to steam and decided to bring along a friend and teach him how to play but he quickly stopped playing after three matches of toxic players calling him trash and to uninstall the game even with warning to these players that he was newer and its to be expected especially with the games terrible tutorial at the time.   The gameplay is solid and exciting for sure. If you have assistance breaking the learning curve and have friends that you can communicate with you will have a much better experience like most games.  One final complaint is the horrid grind to 'master' specific mechs and the game often puts you in uncomfortable positions grinding out currency to pay for varients of the mech you want.  I would recommend this game but its to steep of a curve for new players mixed with the toxicity of the veteran community.

They are in Forbes magazine for having one of the dumbest business strategies in the gaming industry.   Bottum line is that if you like Battletech/MechWarrior then you will like playing this. Thats how I feel. But if you aren't already a fan, you will not deal with the masochism of MWO. It is riddled with poor game play, bugs that have not been fixed after years of beta, game modes that are not compitently tested, and developers who so obviously don't know how to play their own product. It is mind boggling and entertainment in of itself how frequently they want to change random massive gameplay features/foundation of rules that make the game worse every month. But I foolishly play it. Because I love battletech.  Russ Bullock is the owner of the license for this game. He is so bad at his job that it has become a comical event among the community to hear how incompitant he is in Town Hall podcasts at No Guts No Galexy. No joke, members of the community (from a panel that he cherry picked, no less) will literally straight up tell him how to improve his game in a consensus, and he will deflect by monopolize/demogague/mic hoging for 3/4+ of the interview time while everyone is struggling to find words to inform him that the community does not like the things that he wants to implement.  I have not seen a monthly patch come out that was a positive improvement! I'm not exajurating. (Aside from adding mechs into the game, which is always cool if you can get over that they will charge up to $70 for one mech model each time). The game is buggy. New bugs get introduced at a rate of at least 2:1 every patch. It does not improve. The game changes will alter the entire base of the game (such as radically altering the foundation of heat consumption for all weapons, or quirking 50 mech chasis at a time to completely alter the meta -- as opposed to doing one thing at a time and seeing how it pans out).  Its a painful time to be a MechWarrior fan. And I can't wait until Russ looses the license so that good games can be developed for this system by someone that doesn't seem to actively hate his own target audience.",

As far as Battletech fans from the table-top or past MechWarrior games, this is probably not for you, but as it is free-to-play, I would at least give it a try. It is a solid game with TONS of customization and it still feels great getting into those mechs and bringing the pain. It's very possible to have fun playing the game solo but the most fun I've ever had playing this game has been joining up with a full drop team and communicating strategy and tactics during tournaments and scheduled team vs team skirmishes.  One thing I will say about the game as a negative, it has a rather large learning curve. The new in-game tutorial is great and a significant improvement for welcoming new players, but I would still definitely recommend trying to join a MWO clan or group that is willing to teach you the game or at least give you some tips. At the very least maybe watch a tutorial video guide about weapon systems and loadouts. As an example, overall, the premade load-outs for the mechs you use are decent but definitely not the most optimal. Learning which weapons, engines, armor, etc, work best in your mech of choice and which role you should be playing on the battlefield with that loadout, is imperative to your (and your team's) success and overall enjoyment in the game.",

I'd say there are two issues holding the game back:  (1) It's currently a game that's torn between realism/adherence to tabletop Battletech versus focus on gameplay/fun in general. The upside is that they got the basic fighting forumla - the fragging in the basic quick match game mode - down well. It's fun, it rewards aim-based skill, and it rewards good mech loadouts. The downside is that PGI (the developers), have shown that they have trouble understanding the gameplay of their own game, with OP mechs, and then over-nerfs (although eventually they sort out mech balance). Similarly this extends to Community warfare (a special game mode), where realism/adherence to tabletop has made for boring community warefare maps. Case and point is further realism/tabletop mechanics poorly implemented like the CW auto-aim, long-tom artillery which basically fires off a mini-nuke every 2 mins, which kills most mechs in 1-2 hits and has a large radius. It's caused people to stop playing CW in the past - this is just one example. Similarly, PGI nerfed agility and speed of light mechs (a class of mechs) making them them basically underpowered in fights, because that's how they were in tabletop, eventhough lights were balanced before and a very fun class to play, even for the fragging. A third example is that community warfare has more then 8+ factions, making it a total mess with certain factions having too low pops, and others too high, once again imho, because of the focus on tabletop/lore/realism over gameplay.  (2) The game is Pay2NotGrind. As a new player you get a huge starting bonus of c-bills that lets you get a couple lights, 2 mediums, or 1 heavy, so it's not immediately noticeable, but put it this way - an average starting player might average 100k c-bills per 10-15 min match if they are good (after starting bonus expires), but light mechs typically take 5-7 million deck out; assaults usually closer to 15-18mil. If you're good, you can probably average 150k c-bills/match, maybe higher, but it's still a grind. Thankfully, it's not really Pay2Win, although there are some very good mechs that can only be bought with hard cash; the free to play equivalents are generally just as good. There are also trial mechs (can always be played by anyone without buying them) that are decent as well, though you can't customize them. Overall, the Pay2NotGrind seems to be a purposeful decision by PGI to focus on whales (few players who put lots of money in the game), and this tends to hurt the size of the playerbase.  Overall though, it's still a very fun game, and the quick match - individual or group queues - are very fun, even if community warfare isn't. And you can play private games for scrimmages, and there is a very active league quick match scene, so there is real depth to the game. Just a shame that the developers are holding the game back.  p.s. I have another 100 hours on the non-steam version of the game, several years back. Also, I'm a pseudo-whale - I've played this game on and off three times (2014, 2015, 2016) and each time I've spent around $50-60 for a total of about $150-180. That amount has bought me about 12 mechs, mostly heavies. In the same time period of time - or about 200 hours total - I've probably grinded enough money to buy 9 heavy mechs, but I definitely wasted some ingame money by selling weapons after buying them, and then needing them later and having to rebuy them.",

            "review_text": "As someone who came into this game with little to no prior expirience with Battletech/Battletech universe lore, ect i'll just run down the pros and cons of this game.  Pros: -Free2Play setup- realistically, its hard to play this game without spending money. Much like all F2P games, theres the freemium curency, and without it, you dont get many 'mech bays' for housing mechs you purchase. I dropped 20$ twice on this game in total, soley for more of these mech bays and ground for the in game curreny to buy more mechs and mechparts. -Simple mechanics- You join a match, move forward, shoot people with your weapons until one team is dead. -Limited Weapon types- you know what all 4 types of weapons do (Missle, laser, ballistic), they either just get bigger and do more damage or shoot faster/have a longer range -Flexible Loadouts- The mechs are totally customizable to your liking depending on what what the mech is specialized for and what you're looking for. You want a bigger engine for more speed? Cut down on the amount of ammo you want, or make the engine more exposed to critical hits. Take long ranged weapons that dont work in close range combat, or stack up on short ranged dumbfire missles. The choice is yours. -Mech Building- Honestly this is the most enjoyable part for myself. I'll build the most unothrodox mechs to just have fun and screw around with. I'll take a massive mech thats suppossed to be slower, and throw in a massive engine with only a couple weapons and zip around like im a light-scout mech. Theres alot of leeway with that kind of stuff and I have ablast with it. -Decent Community: most people in this community are chill, and will even help you. There is a small group of toxic players, mostly pilots that flame their team mates because they die doing something stupid, but the vast majority are players that have been following mechwarrior for years. They helped me out alot, and I found a group to play with in and outside of mechwarrior because of it.   Cons: -Meta or bust: The game revolves heavily around meta builds/playstyle, especially on the Community Warfare hub. If you arent playing the most optimal builds, you get thrashed match after match, even if your skill is on par (**** Kodiaks- end of story) -Group heavy: The game requires coordination, planning, and teamwork- solo que can be cancer. Find some friends to play with and this problem is easily fixed. -Strict F2P is rough: If you dont plan on spending money at all, then you might want to get used to the monthly free-prebuilt un-customisable mechs, because you only get 3 slots for customizable mechs. -Desire to learn more about the lore: This may just be me, but bein thrown into a world I knew nothing about just didnt suit me, so I found myself spending hours on the wiki learning more on the battletech wiki. -Skill tree- Skill tree grants bonuses to mechs based on expirience with it, but without the bonus's, the mechs dont operate at the peak, out of the box, efficiency, which really hurt some mechs.   All and all, I'd give the game two different scores: Strictly Free to Play: 4/10 Spend what you want to: 7/10",

The hud and cockpit of the mech look amazing and its a first person piloting screen instead of a wonky third person view and weapon selection grouping and fireing is simply an amazing system.  Game runs oddly well on my low end pc 'Im looking at you heroes and generals'.  As with all online games this is great if you have a few friends to play alongside with you though playing with random people was fine anyway as the game requires tactics and skill over who ever has the bigger numbers, iv seen small mechs take down heavy mechs 'because i was in the big mech and im a really bad shot and those little ♥♥♥♥♥ run around so quickly'.

Mose of the developers play it, and do almost daily streams of the game where they're either sponsoring an event and giving awards, or actively playing with the player base. PGI really does care.  That aside, things were rough at the start, but as the game stands now it is a very well cared for rendition of Mechwarrior and Battletech. Sure there are things that are not canon, such as mech releases, some weapons, and quirks, but these are to overall influence the gameplay. Sometimes you have to go against canon the make the game fun. PGI knows this, and does it, but very carefully.  There is a learning curve to the game, but honestly after 5 matches you should understand most of it, roughly. There are nuances to every weight class, mech, faction, weapon selection/loadout. The more thought you put into it, often times, the better you'll be at the game ergo the more fun you'll have.

Understanding the game is your key to winning, but unfortunately it can be a bit difficult to get into.  There is lots of things to juggle and pay attention to at one time while you play. Heat, Armor, Ammo, Movement speed, Limb Strength, current torso direction, current leg direction, radar. Its a lot. When you first play it is a bewildering amount of information that confuses you and makes it hard for you to really know what you are doing. But once you get it, it becomes second nature. You find yourself calling out enemy locations while getting missile lockons, targetting air strikes, and keeping your heat/armor carefully managed.   This is the game's strength. When you finally master the game you really feel like you are piloting a 100 ton battlemech. It feels good to fire autocannons and break the leg of an enemy mech and see him limp away in fear. It feels dire when you run as a light mech, dodging enemy fire and attempting to sabatoge the support units of the enemy team.   Sure the game is complex as all get out, but that makes it all the more *real*. Nothing gives you such grim satisfaction as turning off your heat protection and blowing out your engine in order to suicide kill an enemy mech. Feeling the loud slam as Particle cannon tears off your left arm and you retaliate with your remaining right. Never before has any game but the Mechwarrior series made me feel like I'm actually driving something. You feel connected to your Atlas or Timber Wolf as you would your car or truck. They even made it to the point where you can hear your engine malfunctioning if you are on low health, and you can listen to the hissing of your failing heat sinks if they are destroyed.  Make no mistake. This game is in beta. It still has a long way to go before it is perfect. There's also a lot of skill involved, and it isn't the kind of game that you can learn in just a few hours. But once you do, it is great fun and it is also free!  So join me, and maybe I'll see you on the battlefield mechwarrior.",

So, I've been a Mechwarrior fan since i was 5 playing Mechwarrior 2 Mercs on Windows 95 and i've played every Mechwarrior since and this game is probably my least favorite and the most shallow It's hard to keep playing at a consistant pace. It kinda a bit in common with Battlefront and the developer is almost as greedy as EA. Great graphics with zero depth. it even has it's own version of EA style DLC , you see, every time they add a new mechpack (at a glacial pace) they are first sold for real currency (for the price of a triple A game mind you 60+ USD) , then in game premium currency then you can finally buy it with regular credits after half a year.) this game is lucky it's the only Mechwarrior sim at the moment and they're squeezing us for every penny. Queue times are long for random battles and MM sometimes has a brainfart and gives one team a significant tonnage advantage. there also aren't many maps and the level of content you get for your money is very low. Playing random battles can be confusing for new players and can get stale fast , the tutorial only covers the very basics and the game has a steep learning curve so new players will not know how to make the best builds and will get outgunned by players running metabuilds. the only thing that keeps me playing is Community Warfare which is a competative mode where player clans join factions from the lore and fight against each other for planets and ultimately control of the Inner Sphere. to sum this up i would not say this is a good game, with about 3 years of being online the amount this game developed is pretty pathetic especially when you see what kind of prices they charge for content. I'd only recommend this game if you're a diehard fan who can join a clan and i would urge you to seriously consider if you want to shell out the price of a triple A game for a couple of mechs.",

            "review_text": "First off it is a free to play model game. Knowing that if you are patient you can quite feasably never spend real money on anything in this game and be competitive and slowly grow your stable of mechs. There are always events going on that have various rewards: in game currency(CBills), mechbays (which you need to stable more mechs), cosmetics and even small amounts of MC( purchased currency used to buy hero mechs, mech bays camo patterns etc etc.)  The game has a pretty steep learning curve, learning maps, heat, weapon ranges etc all while staying alive, but the community is friendly, the forums are a great resource for any questions and plenty of helpful people to ask questions.  Now this being a f2p game if you want to play more than the 4 mechs your initial 4 bays alllow the best place to drop some money on the game is for mechbays. a few dollars will get you a good number of bays.    The important thing to note about this game is buying a 'hero' mech does not give you a competitive advantage and in most cases the 'hero' mech is no better and sometimes has a worse layout over a standard mech varient. The only big thing a 'hero' mech will give you is a 30% bonus to CBills when you complete a match which cuts the grind for in game currency before you can purchase that next mech, weapon, module.   Other thing of note is that unlike call of duty type game there is no respawn, your mech has a set amount of armor and structure it can use to absorb incoming damage before you are destroyed, and friendly fire isn't very friendly in MWO. Watch you fire lines, stay with the team and manage your heat.",

The grind could be a bit steep for some (though those that play LoL and the likes are used to the grind)  I play MWO casually due to real-life obligations, and it has been the case since closed beta. I tried it, liked it, got the base founder package (all I could budget). Since then I got some MC, and felt compelled to get the Marrauder package. I am not great skill-wize, but I still find enjoyment. A lot of things you buy can be had from events, especially if you spend a lot of time and become skilled. The cons list might be bigger then the pros, but it is still FUN, and most cons will be progressively ironed out eventualy.  There are some that will say this is the worse game ever (but still play) and those that say it is the best game ever and defend it al all cost.

            "review_text": "I welcome those who are new to this game and I recommend them to fully read this to both understand what to expect and what to do.  A little background on my self with this game, I've been on this game non-stop 3-5 times weekly for teh past 2 years since the founding times so I know what I'm taking about. Also I'm playing all the way from Malaysia in Asia with my buddies/unit based in the US/UK regions and I have like over 120 mechs of both IS and Clan. I'm a Corporal rank in my unit, 1st Crucis Recon and previously we were from Head Hunters of Davion (Davion Faction's largest unit).  What to expect: 1) Light/Medium mechs are fast while Heavy/Assault mechs are slow but powerful (slow as in, you can time and see em turn like how an elephant turns it's body, so basically Light mechs run circles around the bigger guys literally). 2) Mechs are expensive since it's Free To Play, but not impossible to achieve (when I started; with 0 mech of my own, I used the free trail version Hunchback for a week). 3) Don't expect head shots every time, it's super hard to do and very rare (to date I've done less than 50). 4) Grinding/making cash is faster with certain methods (I'll explain later).  Very Important: For those starting, the first thing I recommend is to go setup your VOIP setting in game to ecnable radio communications. This game is all about teamwork with your teammates in every match. Read the guides/manuals/FAQ of the game when you progress further. And most important, play the tutorials to get a hang of things.  Gameplay: For starters, there are 2 types of game; quickplay and Faction-play. Quickplay is a 12vs12 match in either Assault/Conquest/Skirmish mode. Faction-play is choosing a Faction to support by taking a contract (you can select how long; weeks/months/permanent), and playing either defense/attack of planets in a big war of 12vs12 (with each warrior respawn of 4 times/ 4 mechs each). Faction-play although slow and hard for beginners, is quite rewarding in it's faction rewards; some being in game c-bills, free mech bay, gxp, xp and more. I suggest doing some faction games done when you can to at least reach tier 3 of a faction's loyalty rewards programme, you need those free mech bays.  So How Make C-Bills/More Mechs Fast? Play quickplay a lot. As a newbie/PUG, select trail mechs, run in groups with other veteran mechs (mechs with lots of custom paint jobs is a very clear sign) and help them in game. Don't run out alone to just die fast tot eh enemy, it has very little rewards given as c-bills. Doing more of teamwork during games gives you more rewards when you either win/lose the match. Keeping this in mind, it's best to stay alive with the team and if you die, just quit match, reselect another trail mech and find another match. Doing this method could easily see you making about 1million C-Bills within 1 hour. I got my first Hunchback (50 ton medium mech) within a day, so yeah, it's not that tough a grind. Keep playing this way to amke more money and soon you will pick up things like cutomization of your mech weapons, skills and how to use GXP, don't worry; the learning curve is not as hard as some might say, you just need to do some reading like I did.  Gameplay Pros: 1) Awesome graphics, details and effects 2) Cutomizable mechs galore 3) Nice flow of game play and one of the best times I had playing in groups/with teammates 4) Rewards progression of skills, c-bills, game performance per match  Cons: 1) Like all Free To Play, you need to pay some to get to some more mechbays or cumization options like color and patterns. 2) If your teammates don't know what they are doing, the match ends very quickly.",

Just keep in mind this is free2play, so you will likely never own a significiant portion of the mechs. To me it doesn't really matter.

Certainly mastering every mech chassis and finding optimal builds that work for you on all of them would take a long time.   From what I've seen the c-bill (currency earned in game) variants of mechs are at least competitive with, if not better than the mechs you can only buy with real money. As such the only thing you ever 'need' to buy are mech bays, though if you're putting in enough time to get the c-bills for that many mechs (and equiprment) then putting a little money in is fairly reasonable. If you are going to spend real money then the steam dlc 'mech performance packs' aren't the best idea - you only get one mech chassis variant of each type so you'd need to spend quite a lot of time getting the money for two more variants as you need to own three in order to master a chassis, which you'd definitely want to be doing. For my money I'd get a mastery pack for MC (the premium currency) which you can see in-game.  Certainly the game is worth downloading and trying; there's a whole lot of content on offer, most of which you can get without spending anything if you're willing to put in the time.",

Most mechs are purchasable with c-bills which you can earn in-game, and the few 'premium-only mechs are not necessarily 'better' than the non-premium ones (but they do offer a bonus to in-game currency earned in matches). Most of the premium-only items in the game are either cosmetic or boost the rate at which you can earn in-game currency; additional mechbays are an exception, but the 4 you start with are plenty until you want to start building a large mech collection. - the game is very generous for new players. Just completing the tutorials gives you a load of c-bills, while the cadet bonuses from your 1st 25 matches should get you enough to buy any mech in the game (apart from the premium variants mentioned above). - huge range of customisable mechs to buy (in 4 classes light,medium, heavy and assault). The game also has a selection of trial mechs in each class that you can use for free (but you can't customise these) - this allows new players to get a feel for the different weight classes before buying their 1st mech (tip: don't do what I did and spend your cadet bonus before being absolutely sure what type of mech suits you). - lots of mech customisation options (but these may seem complex/baffling for anyone not familiar with mechwarrior games). - the visuals and audio do a great job in making the mechs feel authentic - the matchmaking system attempts to match newer players with other players of the same level of experience - fairly friendly community overall  Cons: - huge learning curve for anyone not familiar with the mechwarrior universe. - the basic tutorials are not really sufficient to prepare new players for the online battlefields, so new players may get frustrated at having to learn to play the hard way. - there is no option to practice against AI mechs, which would help to alleviate the point above. There is an option to wander around empty battlefields to familiarise yourself with the maps, but I suspect that a lot of new players will quickly get get bored with this, if they choose to do it at all. - despite the attempt to match new players with others of similar experience, a lot of matches seem to be quite unbalanced and I can see that this could put off many new players.",

            "review_text": "Disregard my time played: I've been with this game since launch about 2 years ago, and have sunk hundreds of hours into it. Right, so, where to begin... As soon as the game came out, I was instantaneously disappointed. I, and a lot of other fans of the BattleTek and MW franchise wanted Mechwarrior 5. This is, by no means, Mechwarrior 5. Go google Mechwarrior: Living Legends. THAT, is what MW5 should have been like. *Ahem* Anywho, so, yes, this is not the game we wanted, however it is a pretty decent game in it's own rights. Prior to the steam release, the game was much, much more P2W. You used to make 20-30k cbills a match, maybe 50k if you were good. That meant it took eons to save up for mechs you could 'easily' just buy with cash. There were also a lot of mech variants that were marginally better, that were only available for cash. I played it anyway cause, hey, Mechwarrior. Now that it's on steam, it's roughly 200% better in my opinion. I get minimum 100k cbills a match (even if I lose), and up to 400k if I have a good run. That's quite a bit more, and allows me to play around with my loadouts, and get more mechs sooner. Makes the game much less of a grind. So, would I recommend? 6 months ago: No. Now: YES.  Here's some tips for new players: DO NOT WASTE YOUR STARTING CBILLS ON AN 11MIL ASSAULT MECH. Go for something cheaper, so you still have room to mess with the loadout. People always choose the assault mechs, such as the Atlas, because they look bada$$, are freakin huge, and look like they could just tank and destroy everyone. If you believe that, prepare to be let down. Even the mighty Atlas or Direwolf are not tanks. Go with a light mech if you prefer a faster, hit and run/bugger the heck out of the enemy playstyle, or a medium or possibly heavy if you prefer more of a DPS/somewhat-tanking role.  DO YOUR RESEARCH The first mech I bought was a Banshee variant. Was about 8mil cbills if I recall. Thing looked like it could pack quite a bit of power in and seemed well armoured. After purchasing, I realized it only had Laser hardpoints. Not bad thing in of itself, but for a tanking mech like that, all-laser builds do not fare very well. No matter what build I tried, I never found one that i was satisfyed with. So I sold it. SELLING A MECH GETS YOU ROUGHLY 1/4-1/2 THE CBILLS BACK. So make sure you research the mech you're interested in, look up builds, because choosing the wrong mech can be costly.  DON'T EVERYONE BE AN LRM BOAT. An LRM boat is a mech that holds only, or mostly LRM's (long-range missiles). Yes, they're fantastic for surpressing the enemy or providing extra support to the front line mechs, but I've been seeing more and more matches recently with 6-7 (out of 12 total teammates) Maddogs or Catapults (clan and IS lrm boats). As you can imagine, having the majority of your team be artillary does not work very well.   PICK A MECH AND STICK WITH IT. This goes along with what I said earlier, but it adds more. Staying with one mech will benefit you much more than having a load of them. Once you learn how to play a mech, and play it well, and create your perfect loadout, the game gets 1000% more fun. Seriously. Once you get your insanely fast light mech and start running around the enemies shredding the armour and destroying them, or once you get your beefy assault/heavy mech and partake in glorious close-mid range all out brawls? That's where this game shines. I found my perfect mech a couple weeks ago, the Arctic Cheeta ACH-B. Got my perfect loadout, and I've maxed out it's efficiencies. Even though I've now nothing to work towards with it (nothing to unlock for it), just messing about with different loadouts is fun. And playing the thing? It's fantastic, I love the hit and run style it allows for.   GAME DOESN'T RUN WELL? You see those minimum specs down there? Disregard them. You see those recommended specs down there? Disregard them too. I run an FX-6300, 6 core, OC'd to 4.1ghz, R9 270x 2gb (slightly better than a GTX 750ti), 16 gb 1600mhz ram, and an SSD, displaying to a 1920x1080 monitor. I average 50-60 fps, drop down to 30-40 when it hits the fan. On low graphics. Now, imo, the game looks the same on all graphic settings, so I highly suggest you just go with minimal graphics. This is one of those games where 30 and sometimes even sub 30 FPS is playable, however, if you play a light mech, you need the fastest response time you can get, so 60 FPS would be best.   USE VOICE COMMS. AGAIN, USE. VOICE. COMMS. Play a match where your team just communicates with text chat, or not at all, to a game where your team talks with VOIP, and you'll see a large difference. When VOIP comes in to play, that's when the real fun happens. Tactics, strategy, mid-game banter with your 'mates. The community is quite friendly from what I've seen too, I've never had a bad 'mate on VOIP. Even if only to say 'Assault lance advanding delta 6' or such every so often, use voice comms. It makes the match so, so much better.  I hope this review and some of these tips helped you, and I'm glad to see new players to this game from steam! Have a good one, and happy hunting.",

Mechwarrior Online is the legacy of a decade of Mechwarrior/Battletech videogames, and an even longer period of tabletop gaming. It's not a twitch shooter; if that's what you're looking for, I wouldn't recommend this. Mechwarrior Online is the 'thinking man's shooter' where logistics and strategy are key to win. However, if you just want to run around and derp anyone who comes near you: go for it. There are a wide variety of playstyles and skills in this game. It's definitely not a pay to win game; you don't have to pay a cent and you can still have the time of your life (however, some mech variants and most cosmetics can only be purchased with real money). Gamers who fear RNG (I came here from World of Tanks, so believe me when I tell you I know what RNG is) need not worry: the game has very strict calculations, so if an enemy kills you, you know it wasn't just sheer stupid luck and you don't have to rage as much over a missed shot when you know it isn't just spray and pray. Overall I can't recommend this game enough. If you made it this far into the wall of text, congrats and I thank you for caring about an old pilot's opinion (make sure to vote this as helpful!). If I were you, however, I would watch some videos on Youtube about how to play this game (it can be a bit confusing for new players). A few short tips: always hit the 'R' key to mark opponents (this will give you info on how far away they are, how damaged they are, allow you to target them for your long range missile allies, and give you a credit bonus if you are the first to target them... hitting 'R' is IMPORTANT), don't underestimate the value of heatsinks (they cool you down faster so you can fire more often and they also add internal health), don't put the maximum number of LRMs as you can on a mech (they are for suppression, not pure damage, so only put a few small ones on most mechs so you can constantly chain fire them), always pay attention to your heat (if you overheat, you're dead. period.) and always assume you can get better. If you haven't committed suicide over the sheer boredom of reading this whole thing, good for you! Enjoy the game and I look forward to seeing you on the battlefield, pilot (look for the name 'Sovietshadow').",

It's pretty easy to get the hang of with the great tutorial. You start with some free mechs that are really good. As you win matches you earn cash to purchase mechs that you can customize with different weapons depending on your playstyle. Buying a mech with real money is a shortcut, but doesn't provide any REAL benefits - just different mechs with different configurations (more lasers and less armor, jump jets vs rockets, etc).   It's really fun, give it a try.",

Despite what you might hear, the game has a come a long way and nails the feel of piloting giant walking tanks from the Battletech universe. Gameplay is both varied due to the different mech classes but can get repetitive because of the limited gamemodes. At times balance between items/mechs can be very frustrating but it is generally better than it has been in the past and it seems like they are making progress (despite it being slow).   Evidently, despite my criticism and my hope for more content/features I enjoy the experience. My advice, find a unit, make some ingame friends and have some fun. The game really does come together when you start seeing teams working together.",

No. It sorta works, there is some fun to be had here. The F2P model is terrible, its grindy and expensive. Worse than wargaming games. But if you throw away some money and grind forever, it can be fun. Sadly, the whole 'outfit your mech' doesnt work well here. You generally have to set your mech up with whatever flavor of the month builds are working to be competitive. If you end up wasting your hard earned cash on the wrong part and/or mech, you're in for a bad time. Even some of the paid stuff is garbage.  As a battletech game, it is blasphemy. Nothing is right about this game, the devs know nothing about battletech. They just jumped on the license, hired someone else to make this game.. then fired those guys and went on to milk battletech fans for their money. Now they are here to milk you for your money. Seriously, go watch some of their videos. They are canadian car salesmen, not programmers or gamers.   Ultimately, I hate this game, I hate the devs, and I hate the spineless legion of white knights who hold this turd up in the spotlight. Most positive reviews will come from these guys, they are all 500+ dollars in and they desperately do not want the game to die. They want you to play and will say anything to get you to play. They are sad broken people, and if you do get sucked into scam warrior online you will end up sad and broke as well.  UPDATE: Just to be sure i tried the steam version. Some things are better than i remember, some things are worse. The most dissapointing issue is that groups of 2 are still put against groups of up to 9+. So if you want to play with just one friend, you are doomed to constant and quick defeats. And no, the devs will not fix this. This is INTENTIONAL. They are feeding you to their whales who have dropped $1000's into this game.  Also the time to kill is way too low. You spend 90% of the time loading, and walking to the spot where you will die.

I say percieved as its really just a loud buch of angry jerks demanding things, not getting them and getting more angry.  The game is good fun, Its got a steep learnign curve but it is worth it.  Comunity Warfare is a bit shallow. SO think of this as Counter Strike with big robots and you will have decent expectations.  Its not Pay To Win at all. Its not even Pay to not Grind ether.  Its also not a game where you can expect to own all the mechs. Its just not that kind of game. If you want to collect every thing, try Pokemon instead.  My tips: Play with friends. Cooperation is hugely rewarded. Buy a medium mech to start with and enjoy the hell out of it. Don't stress about mastering mechs. Smart play will trumph load outs, mastery and and modules every time. Think before you act. The wrong choice will get you dead fast.  There are loads of mechs, loads of customization stuff, loads of different tactics and stratergies to try. Ballance is good.

My suggestion for any new people who know very little about either the BattleTech or MechWarrior franchise is to take a look at the in-game forums (especially the New Player Guides). The information present there will be very helpful in getting you started and navigating the game’s (somewhat steep at times) learning curve…though you should also take care as well, there’s a very salty group of veterans in there as well. While many of them may of them mean well, they can come across very angry. These people do not necessarily have to be avoided; just take what these guys say with a grain of salt. Even then, there are plenty of other players and veterans who are more than willing to help newcomers who are a LOT less rough around the edges.   This all being said, the game is a very good game…but not Triple A by any means (though it doesn’t pretend that it’s trying to be…despite the comparisons some people keep trying to make). Despite that, the gameplay is complex and diverse when it comes down to ‘Mech construction (and there are a LOT of customization options!), and no match will ever be played the say way twice.   My suggestion for new players is to make use of the MechWarrior Academy and all of its different features; this will help you learn a good portion of what you need to know and when you’re ready, pick up a trial ‘Mech and have fun. You will get a significant bonus to your in-game money (called C-Bills) for your first 25 games which should put you well on the road to picking up your first, fully customizable BattleMech.  ",

Sound and graphics are fantastic, controls are solid. It's good, solid fun.  As well, Faction Play is still fairly new, and allows a hardcore style game mode for conquest of the Inner Sphere. This isn't for everyone, and isn't fully finished yet, but can be a lot of fun. Unlike quick play matches, it doesn't feature skill based matchmaking: Gather up your friends, form or join a mercenary company, and conquer worlds! You *can* play it solo, but you shouldn't - solo play is lots of fun in Quick Play matches, but solo players in Faction Play will find themselves facing organized units... And that just ends badly for disorganized solo players. In the end, if you're looking for an awesome group activity, Faction Play (formerly Community Warfare) is it.  As well, I'll address this: You'll see some really negative reviews. These are predominantly from older 'bittervet' players. To be sure, in the early days of PGI (and their former publisher, IGP) there were some profoundly stupid community management blunders. Those people have a valid reason to be upset, but their complaints are complaints of things that happened years ago. Give the game a try, stop by on the  mwomercs.com  forums and check out the new players section for very valuable help.   In closing: This is a very fun game, but it's a complex game as well. It does have a fairly steep learning curve, however it really rewards spending the time to learn. If you're a Mechwarrior veteran, it's largely as you'd expect. If you've never piloted a Mech before, though, don't be afraid to ask for help.",

            "review_text": "As a Legendary Founder who's played MWO off and on since the closed beta, I would recommend this game, BUT (and this is a huge but), there are several things to consider before diving into the game.  First of all, it's not your average shooter; it has a steep learning curve, especially steep if you've never played any of the older MechWarrior titles. A focal point is the 'Mech lab, where you can customize any 'Mechs you own with different sets of weaponry, engines, and other equipment. As it stands right now, you can't customize Clan 'Mechs as intricately as you can Inner Sphere 'Mechs, though on the other hand you CAN swap out different segments of a Clan 'Mech's chassis for different models of its kind, in case you needed a particular set of hardpoints. With customization of Inner Sphere 'Mechs, you can go so far as to change its engine, its internal structure, its armor type, and even jumpjets if they're allowed on a particular chassis... though you can't change an Inner Sphere 'Mech's hardpoints for weapons to be equipped. It's not rocket science, but for anyone new to the series, it takes some getting used to. Far more in-depth than your usual customized loadouts for a shooter.  Next, there's MWO's Free to Play claim. Now, it's NOT Pay to Win as some disgruntled trolls would like to claim it is, but it is at the very most Pay for Convenience. The premium in-game currency (MC) can be purchased with real-world cash on MWO's homepage, but if you pay attention to the events PGI hosts, you could earn MC without spending a penny. MC can be spent on things like more 'Mech bays, paint, camo schemes, cockpit decor, slightly improved versions of modules like air strikes, artillery bombardment, UAV drones for scouting/ECM countering, and what have you.  More expensive items to buy with MC would be special variants of 'Mechs you couldn't otherwise get with C-bills, the normal in-game currency you earn just from playing the game. What makes these 'Mechs so special is that when they're used, they can boost your C-bill earnings, and/or your experience points for unlocking perks. 'Hero 'Mechs' are also bought with MC, which also include the C-bill boost, though don't be fooled by the name-- they're not all that more powerful than their normal counterparts-- if anything I'd argue they're slightly LESS powerful, but sometimes with radically different hardpoint setups for different playstyles; any advantage gained on the battlefield is dependent upon the pilot, not the 'Mech.  Another thing to pay for with MC is Premium Time, which allows you to play private matches between you and your friends, as well as boosts your experience points and C-bill earnings in public matches. It's worth it once you're used to how the game plays. Premium Time can also be earned by some of the special events that PGI sets up now and again.  Also, PGI has throughout the development of the game released pre-order packs for additional 'Mechs, which may seem like 'Pay to Win' at first, but... the pre-order packs are more aptly described as 'Pay for Vanity' because you simply get them earlier than if you grinded for C-bills and waited for the newer 'Mechs to be available for C-bills. That may still sound unfair to the newer players still stuck with Trial 'Mechs, but... speaking from experience, I bought into all the 'Mechs which were released thus far, and hopping from one to another while going up against dedicated players grinding for C-bills in their preferred 'Mechs they were already familiar with-- THOSE guys are the winners. Trust me. I don't regret my purchases a bit, but they're by no means a guarantee for my victory on the battlefield. Like I said, any advantage gained is dependent on the pilot, not the 'Mech.  Finally... PGI is still developing the game. They're a small company with an ambitious goal here, and even though there are already some embittered players out there who feel ripped from some of the decisions made in the game's development, you can't please everyone. PGI continually looks through the forums for feedback and development suggestions, and have gone through and started revamping older maps already. Plus, there has even been a good period of time when PGI said certain 'Mech models referred to as 'the Unseen' originating from a dispute between Harmony Gold and FASA would not be put into the game despite the fanbase's desire... and yet just this month, the Marauder was added into the game, and pre-orders are up for the Warhammer, the Rifleman, and (I'm guessing) will come soon for the Archer.  As of right now, the two major kinds of public gameplay are the Quick Match and Community Warfare. Both involve two teams of 12 players each. The Quick Match is the public match anyone can hop into, and the three gamestyles include Skirmish, Conquest, and Assault. Skirmish is just that-- eliminate the enemy team. Conquest is basically 'capture the control point', though with more control points you capture, the more resources you accrue, and the match can be won by accruing a certain amount of resources before the opposing team. Assault is basically where your team captures the enemy base while defending your own. In all of these play styles, the match can be won by flat-out eliminating the other team.  With community warfare, it's a bit more strategic. You build a 'deck' comprising of four 'Mechs, locked to either being Inner Sphere or Clan tech, based on the faction you join. You find a planet that's actively queued by other players, (though I highly recommend joining a unit for better coordination with the team), and then you get dropped onto the planet, either to attack or defend. In either scenario, there will either be a set of three generators you have to destroy or defend, and upon their destruction, a final point in the base is revealed which must be destroyed to secure the Attackers' victory on the planet. Sometimes, however, there will only be that final point to attack/defend, and in that case there won't even be defensive gates or turrets in the base. Sometimes, there are players who like to turn it into an all-out slugfest, winning by kills alone, but this can be risky, especially when pushed into the other team's drop zone, as opposing dropships can cut your 'Mech to ribbons. I recommend getting comfortable piloting a good deal of 'Mechs before hopping into Community Warfare, because you may very well need to use all four 'Mechs in one match-- they act as your 'extra lives', but that won't do you much good if you're only comfortable with one or two of the 'Mechs in your deck.  tl;dr - This game is fun. It may not be for everyone, but it's still growing, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.",

Mechwarrior allows for an individual to make a substantive difference in the fight. And perfecting your mechs loadout is extremely enjoyable. The weapon interactions are also awesome, you can rain down wave after wave of long distance missles on your opponents or sweep across them with high powered lasers, or my personal favorite get up close and personal and fight with powerful balistic cannons.

            "review_text": "This game has a long and sordid history. First released into closed beta back in 2012, the publisher, IGP, and developer, PGI, promised the sun, and all within 90 days. Nearly two years later and they had almost nothing to show for it. Then The developer, PGI, bought out it's publisher in early 2014 and came out in the open about how the publisher had been holding them back all along. Since then the game has steadily been getting better. We now have practically all of what was originally envisioned (even if some of it is still getting polished), some of the best balance we've seen in a while, with only a handful of weapons being below average, and developers that actually listen to the community (sometimes).  The reason you see most of the negative reviews stem from all of this drama, dating back years. Promises were broken and the founding players of the game got upset. PGI made mistakes, but for the past two years has generally been going in the right direction and fixing many of it's wrongs. Give this title a shot, it's free, it's fun, it's giant stompy robots!  Speaking of free, let me expand on that. This is not a pay to win game. Paid content falls under three categories: Early access, easier grind, and decorations.  Early access means that there are mech packs that are bundled and pre-sold before they make it in the game. you get a bundle of high value stuff, but typically won't see it for 3-6 months. You then get to play these new mechs for a month or two before being released for in-game currency. Most of the time these new mechs are at or below average. Occasionally they end up being powerful. But anyone can eventually earn these mechs.  Easier grind deals with purchasing hero mechs and premium time. Premium time increases the rate of XP and in game money you earn. Hero mechs are special variants of mechs that also have a %increase in in-game money and slightly different hardpoints. Sometimes these hero mechs are slightly better than normal, sometimes they are slightly worse. They are rarely the best mechs in the game.  Decorations include paint jobs, camo schemes, and cockpit items. Similar to TF2 hats and decor, you can truly customize your mech to make it uniquely you.  All in all, if you like big stompy robots, look no farther than this game. You will truly feel like you are piloting massive tanks on legs, and the tagline 'A thinking man's shooter' it rightly deserves. Catch me in game!",

Mechwarrior is probably the game that most makes me want Steam to have reviews capable of scoring a game with something other than 'Yes' and 'No'. I feel positive about Mechwarrior overall, but it's certainly not a 10/10 game.  Out of all the 'freemium' vehicle-based shooter games I've played, I think Mechwarrior is probably the most customizable and in-depth when it comes to builds. The game has had a large problem with 'meta' mechs being significantly better than others, though an in-depth rebalance has just occurred in time for the Steam release. The game is certainly not pay-to-win. Generally, the more you sink into a mech, the worse it actually is. Learn to play!  The gameplay can feel 'samey' after a while, with no real variety in game modes and a particularly long grind to get to the good stuff, but I don't particularly mind that. Joining one of the more popular clans in the game was honestly the most fun I had in it, I should really get back into that. GO MERCSTAR!  I think my chiefest complaint with the game is honestly the community: Mechwarrior has a dedicated following of older players, who played the game over AOL Messenger sometime in the early 1700s or something. They're honestly the rudest bunch of players I've had the misfortune of meeting, and I play Team Fortress, League, and CS. 'Backseat' driving, perpetually complaining about how awful their own team is, shouting 'orders', the whole nine yards.

Besides that 'community warfare' aka 'faction play' nowadays – this where you can play coordinated 12vs12 matches – rarely have more than 10 matches going on at a time, so you wait ~15 Minutes in the queue for a group to form, and another ~10 minutes for an opponent. If you don't get an opponent the match starts anyway... kill objective... repeat – another 20 Minutes of waiting for the next match.  That 'public group' (PUG) – which is the regular multiplayer – is worse because you get thrown on a random map. You pick your mech first, then all players can vote for 1/4 maps and 1/2 gamemodes which are randomly picked each time. Good luck finding a map that fits your loadout. Because of this most of the matches end in long range sniping.  Sadly this only mechwarrior action you are gonna get right now.

            "review_text": "Where to begin? I have played this game for 3 years...  The developers ignore the community, they do not listen about balance, or any game details when suggestions are made to improve the game. In fact, most often they summarily ignore all feedback and put up what they are going to put up. The developers are also all pro Inner Sphere, and you can tell.  The tech:  Clans have Tier 4 tech, but it is nerfed into oblivion such as:  Clan mechs have completely locked components aside from weapon hardpoints that can be semi-swapped around Clan mechs lose 20% of their speed when they lose a side torso and lose 20% of cooling capacity Clan mechs cannot be upgraded for anything but a missile targeting system Clan mechs cost roughly 40% more for inferior mechs Clan lasers do not use full double range Clan lasers have absurdly long DoT durations to get full damage Clans weapons run hotter Clan autocannons are all multi projectile Clan weapons all have longer cooldowns  Inner Sphere has Tier 2 tech (because PGI will not give them Tier 4 tech because they ignore the community) with stupid buffs:  Inner Sphere mechs can change engines Inner Sphere mechs can upgrade multiple things on the mech Inner Sphere mechs can add/remove Jump Jets Inner Sphere mechs cost half of what a similar clan mech costs Inner Sphere weapons all run significantly cooler Inner Sphere lasers have less than half the DoT time of clan lasers (to get full damage) Inner Sphere weapons have full double range Inner Sphere autocannons are single projectile pinpoint damage Inner Sphere weapons have much shorter cool downs Inner Sphere SRMs have much tighter patterns better focusing damage Inner Sphere SRMs do more damage per missile than Clan SRMs Inner Sphere mechs get standard engines, which have no penalty on loss of Side Torso  Inner Sphere mechs all have ridiculous positive quirks such as: Less heat generation (making already cool weapons absurdly cool) Greater range (yes, they get full double range, *and* range quirks...) Shorter Cooldowns on their pinpoint auto cannons and better SRMs  Now...onto balance...what balance?  The group queue is an arena for 8-12 man groups to stomp small groups and trash talk, so steer clear of that. That means dropping by yourself in the solo queue.  The solo queue has better balance about who you play against, but the maps are repetitive, there are 3 game modes that are really only one game mode dressed up, and be prepared to not see more than about 3 of the many maps in game because everyone wants to play the small cold maps to burn through the game.   The business model...are you ready for this?  If you want to buy a mech, it will cost you between $20-$50 for a mech, you can grind them out, but it takes 20 years to make money. Mech packs are a better value, but to get the one good mech in a pack, you must either pay a $55 a la carte to get it (and forego any purchase rewards for the pack), or you must often pay upwards of $80-120 for the whole pack to get a bunch of crappy mechs and the one you wanted. They have recently started packs that are $35 for a mastery bundle, but that is for just the one mech. The mech packs are behind a pay wall for a significant time when they are released, and the good mechs are OP to get people to buy them, and then once the new mech pack is announced, all the last mech pack mechs are nerfed into oblivion so you have to buy the next pack to keep up.  The community is toxic, yes, that is right, TOXIC, as in T-O-X-I-C. They will smack talk you for being new, they will smack talk you for any deificiencies in skill, and they will smack talk you for doing better than them. You get morons on the in game VOIP that talk about stupid things, and occasionally you get people talking about things that you really do not want to hear.

It is a waste of time and money...there was a time when the game was better, and it just keeps slipping further and further from that point.

            "review_text": "Mechwarrior online is an unconventional firstperson shooter multiplayer only “light” vehicle sim game in the same vein as world of tanks, warships, warthunder, and armored warfare. However, unlike those games, MWO is player skill based rather than RNG based. I have been playing it since closed beta started three years ago. Being my most played game since release I quite like the game, obviously, but I cannot give an unconditional recommendation. This game is quite difficult, and has a very high learning curve, especially if you are not familiar with vehicular games, or past mechwarrior titles. Additionally the new player experience and progression is quite difficult, and will require patience, and dedication.  Where as in the other F2P vehicle games progression is based on working ones way up a tech tree of vehicles (tier 1-10, with low tiers being very easy to work through), MWO has no such model. All mechs are available from the word go, and the only limitation is the amount of currency you have (the soft currency C-bills, or MC). The problem with this model of progression is that the grind hits immediately, and can be very intimidating to a new player. MWO does have systems in place to speed a new players acquisition of Cbills however, (the inflated income from the Cadet Bonus, and money rewards for playing through tutorials, early achievements etc), but it will not last forever. There is no easing the new player in with low tier (1-4) vehicles like in World of tanks. Additionally, there is currently no in game tutorials for using the mechlab (the area where you customize your mechs and loadouts), so you will either need to seek guides elsewhere, or work it out through trial and error.   Be sure to play though the tutorials, practice in the training grounds, and try out each of the trial mechs to get an idea of the kind of game-play you want before committing to your first purchase, as it could color your whole experience. But once you find your bearings, MWO is a very fun and challenging multiplayer arena shooter with a lot of room to expand in the future (single player content is currently under development).  It should also be noted that the developers often run special events (around 2 per moth at least) where you can earn prizes by completing various challenges. The prizes vary with the event, but can include Cbills, General experience, consumable packs, to premium content such as cockpit items, additional mech bays, paints, skins, MC, and even premium mechs. Christmas will be a good time to play is all I am saying :D",

I'm a founder and have probably 1000hrs played off Steam. Get into a clan or get someone to help you out if you're new. IGN: Haunt Steiner - add me if you want help and you're new.  PROS and CONS  + Lots of different mechs with different variants of each chassis and many have specific quirks that alter their playstyle a bit. The amount of mechs you can pilot is large.   + Building an effective mech is a challenge. You will spend hours messing with every detail and tweaking a build, testing it in matches, and going back to the garage for more tweaks.  + Situational awareness will carry you pretty far, as well as being a team player.  + The community is really great. There are people who can be really salty about the game's management over the past few years, but most of them are just really die-hard battletech fans who want a really great modern addition to the Mechwarrior franchise.  CONS  - Recent balance patches have changed this recently, but the evolution of the meta-game has been really rocky. Mixed weapon type loadouts used to be laughably bad. Clan mechs were king. Lasers+Gauss were king. Missles were a joke. Some variants had ridiculous quirks that were the only reason they were competitive. The new balance patch seems to have shaken the meta up and things are still developing as people figure out what works or not.  - Some weapons are just plain bad. Recent balance patch has changed this a bit but flamers and MGs and sometimes AC/2s are still a waste of space.  - Some mechs need rescaling in order to be competitive. This is announced and coming soon.  - There are people with aimbots and other hacks out there, rarely. They're easy enough to spot because they always aim center mass on any mech and seem 'locked' there. Just report them.  - Mech packs are expensive. Recent classic packs aren't so bad because they come with 30 days prem time and a bunch of other goodies along with 3 variants. You don't really need to buy them if you can wait for them to be released for in game currency.      It's a fun game, play it but expect a long skill curve. I think I spent my first month or two without ANY KILLS back in 2013.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR and background: I was around for the closed beta of this game and have followed the development for the last 4 years up until the steam release. This is an average arena shooter made by a mediocre developer with 4 years of bad history behind them.  Pros: - Art design is good. - On an extremely basic level, the gameplay feels about what a mechwarrior game should feel like.  Cons: - Glacial development pace. - Balance and metagame are in a constant state of tail chasing. Instead of fixing a specific issue that causes some undesired meta, PGI makes broad sweeping changes that may or may not fix the original problem while causing more problems of their own. - Game mechanics are simplistic and often counter-intuitive. Nowhere near something deserving of the mechwarrior franchise. - Grind is bad. In order to max out a mech, you need to purchase and max out 3 different variants. Each varriant costs between 5-12 million cbills to buy, and then another 4-10 million to equip effectively. An average new player can expect to earn about 100-120k cbills per match. Do the math. - PGI has a rich history of releasing mechs for real money in a horribly overpowered state, denying that said mechs are overpowered, then nerfing them shortly before they become availible for ingame currency. When asked about this, the CEO of the company made a joke likening people who found that to be sketchy to 9/11 conspiracy theorists. - Gameplay gets boring and repetitive after about 15 hours of play. - Playing solo has fairly low wait times and passable matchmaking. Add a single friend to the mix and you get put in group queue, where you'll get roflstomped repeatedly by organized deathballs of 12 mechs.  In summary, if you want to play and have fun for a week or two, go for it. Just don't expect any great improvements or groundbreaking new innovation.",

They also have double the amount of mechs and they are all cheaper than Clan mechs. Omni Pods Balance out the price but the very few Clans mechs you can get are all nerfed in comparison.

THEN 'gametime'. ive also had a WoW sub since 2009 so im very much used to paying for subs, but for my subscription i expect to be able to get ALL currencies in game and access to all characters. Sure you get to use 'trial' mechs occasionaly, but you need to buy your mechs, starting off with a free 24 hours 'gametime'. You can buy mechs with in gmae currency, BUT to win youll need to buy some heroic/champion mechs. Long story short, your sub gets you +50% bonus rewards for missions. thats it. mech packs start at around $20 and collectors editions are $40. You need to pay premium currency to 'convert' your XP to unlock the most important upgrades to your mech. if you love mechwarrior, you will enjoy this, just expect the grind of your life if you want to keep your cash.",

            "review_text": "In rough terms, MWO is Team Fortress crossed with Arma with giant robots. There are 4 classes of mechs, light, medium, heavy, and assault. Light mechs have little armor and are like the annoying, nimble spy. Mediums and heavies are slower, have more armor and weapons, and are like the soldier. Assaults are slow, lumbering, and hightly armed like the Heavy. Basically the slower a mech moves the more armor and weapons it can have.   It plays like Arma. It's highly beneficial to move as a team and use tactics. Unless you're playing a light mech its hard to bunny hop your way out of trouble, so you must be decisive and deliberate. Mechs (other than lights) move at a slower pace than most FPS games, but I wouldn't say the game play is dull or slow. When you're in a brawl it is intense.  The progression system is grindy. To increase a mechs power you have to level up 3 variant mechs of the same chassis to master it. Then you have level up 6 more to unlock elite skills. Now you have mastered one weight class of mech and have to level up 27 more mechs. The problem is you probably don't want most of these mechs so it becomes a chore.  The payment model of the game is likely responsible for some of the lack of fun in the progression system. It should have been either a flat purchase of $60 or charge a monthly access fee. They could learn a lot from Blizzard games like Diablo III or Heroes of the Storm. There is also a purchasable in-game currency called MC which is anti-consumer because you always have to buy more of it than what you need and it obfuscates what things actually cost.  The game is stable and I don't have crash, lag, or connection issues.  The graphics are getting dated. The game needs an update to make the mechs and environments more detailed and brighter. Mechs don't feel large. The MSAA in the game is very taxing even on my NVidia 780. I just barely get 60fps when MSAA is enabled.  Despite my gripes, the game is a lot of fun. I recommend it with the caveat that you need to be willing to spend money on premium time to reduce the grind. I couldn't imagine playing it without the 50% C-Bill/XP bonus. Progression would be unacceptably slow.",

(Warning: Not for faint of heart) - o7 Yolkmaster  ---  Since only 5 individuals found this review helpful, I shall elaborate.   I've now been playing this game for one year. It took me a good while to finally engage and appreciate this game.  There are a lot of individuals who will either bash the game, or bless it. I have no knowledge of battle tech game lore, and perhaps because of that I am not irritated by the decisions made by 'PGI'. I will agree that there are a lot of aspects of the game which were quite awful at some point. The vast majority of these issues have since been addressed. Over the year that I've played the game I would say that PGI has done an over all decent job in fixing and adding to the game.  I don't really want to continue with the politics or any other irrelevant back stories.  Looking at the game itself and the gameplay. It's a niche game but can be incredibly satisfying. I perhaps enjoy it so much because of the metagame. I would say a lot of individuals perhaps hate the metagame because, 'it creates a lack of variety and renders some mechs OP in comparison to others'. Personally, I disagree with these claims. There certainly are super cookie cutter builds, and yes there are some mech builds that are optimal for certain mechs (because of quirks), however I've found that almost all the 'cookie cutter' builds posted online aren't perfect. This being said, with some creativity and careful planning, there are still a lot of better builds that can be made and tailored to your liking while still being competitive.  (-I should warn that there are a good number of mechs that are actual garbage!-)  However the variety in mechs is amazing!  Being able to optimize these builds for my play style has resulted in even higher damage outputs in comparison to said 'cookie cutter' builds.  I don't want to sound patronizing, but as a player you must be able to think outside the box in your builds, but also also pilot your mech efficiently in order to be successful and enjoy the game. You will find that a large portion of the individuals complaining about the game are those who aren't successful in battle (and I feel bad for them).  In summary, I wouldn't allow the opinion of others to sway you from trying out a free to play game.  I would also strongly recommend not spending any money in this game until you've spent many hours and bought several mechs with in game currency only. Also spend a good amount of time researching before purchasing your first crucial mech. The first mech you purchase will most likely decide if you continue to play the game or not.  I would say spend some time in game, and generate some genuine opinions for your self. Don't be discouraged by the learning curve, I remember what it was like.  Best of luck.  Yolk Master Flex",

It mostly feels like you're driving a tank or heavy machinery. The game is about customization too. When you finally own your own mechs, it is a lot of fun buying weapons and upgrades and making your build as unique or efficient as you can. The weapons are pretty well balanced at this point. There have been problems however with game balance for the first 2 years. It seems like every time a weapon system became to powerful they would nerf the heck out of it 6 months later. The fighting in the game is not like a traditional shooter because you have armor distributed throughout your mech and arms and legs and other parts of mechs can be destroyed which is part of the strategy to fighting. Sometimes for example, you want to take out a shoulder where a weapon is mounted or shoot at the legs to take away the enemys ability to move. The graphics are well done in my opinion. They have actually recently gotten better. The gameplay is solid with few crashes. Overall the behaviour of players is pretty good too.  There is a con however. While the game is free to play, playing as a new player is a very punishing experience. As a new player you will not initially own your own mech. You are given a handful of mechs with preconfigurations that are not optimal to go and fight against players who have the benefit of customizing and leveling thier mechs. This means they probably can fire thier weapons with more heat efficiency, move faster, and even turn and aim faster. Not from skill mind you, it is programmed into the game. After you have been sufficiently hazed, you then have enough cbills to buy your own mech. Hopefully you choose a good one because after that grinding for cbills can be extremely time consuming. If you are a crazy person, or just don't care about being at a disadvantage, you will eventually get more mechs and it wont be so bad. This is how PGI gets money from this game. They are counting on you paying money at some point in order to keep your sanity and they charge a premium for every ounce of sanity.  Overall I've spent $60 founders package and another $30 MC and consider it totally worth it. I've had a lot of fun and made some friends and hundreds of hours of entertainment. Despite how new players are punished I recommend trying the game out for free. You might get hooked.",

Just player versus player really does not cut it. You can get away with just player versus environment but you can no longer just get by with player versus player. More stragetic scenarios are required and you can not get players to set them up, you need npcs to do that and players just to react to it.

        {
            "review_text": "MWO is a simulation/shooter hybrid. You take the part of a Mechwarrior, piloting a Battlemech or an Omnimech (different build philosophies that impact customization). Mechs are giant walking tanks with discrete hit locations (arms, legs, side torsos, front/back, etc.) that each track their own health (armor and internal health) and can mount equipment (from weapons, to ammo, to sensors, and more).  Run the Tutorial before you do anything else. It'll help you get a feel for how your Mech operates, and when you finish it you'll get a chunk of c-bills (in-game currency) to help you get started. Visit the official forums and check out the New Player Help section - there are numerous veteran players who will do everything they can to help you get started.  There are two modes: Quick Play and Faction Play. Quick Play can be solo or group. You will be matched with players who are at or near you skill tier (new players start at 5, with the scale being 5 at the lowest and 1 at the highest). As you play, your Pilot Skill Rating (what the Tier level is based on) will change based on your performance, and should eventually result in you being consistently matched with and against players at or around your ability level, making for consistently challenging matches.  Group play requires being in a group, from 2 to 10 players, or a full 12-man team. This tends to be a lot more challenging, especially if you group with a player of a much higher tier, but it also is more rewarding, as nothing beats playing with a group of friends and coordinating your maneuvers and focusing your fire to defeat a superior foe.  Faction Play involves teams of 12 players attempting to sieze planets on behalf of one of the factions in the game. Each player chooses 4 mechs for their Dropship, within certain tonnage limits. You then pick which mech to drop in first, and after it is destroyed you return to your Dropship and choose the next mech to use. This can lead to some truly epic matches, including upsets and turn-arounds as a losing team picks the right combination of new mechs that allows them to roll over the enemy and take a dominant position. Game modes so far include Invasion, where one team defends an orbital defense gun and the other tries to disable it by destroying generators, and Counter Attack, where the attacking side tries to hold conquered territory against rallying defenders.  Faction Play is currently a mixed bag, as it tends to be dominated by large player groups (units), making it hard for small groups and solo players to succeed. However, there are enough tools built into the game to allow a smart team of solo players to beat a full pre-made team, though it's always an up-hill battle. The recent addition of Faction Chat and Looking-For-Group features makes it easier to create an ad hoc team, rather than relying on random matchmaking to build your team.  Faction Play is also going to be getting a major new addition soon, in the form of 4v4 Recon drops. These are supposed to allow a faction to unlock special abilities for their teams in Invasion and Counter Attack games, starting with intel on the enemy team, moving to periodic sensor sweeps, and culminating in off-map Long Tom artillery support (see the giant explosion at the end of the Steam Launch Trailer).  Quick Play and current Faction Play modes are all 12v12, which can make it difficult for a single player to feel like he's making a significant contribution to the game, and it makes positioning mistakes incredibly deadly. 4v4, when it arrives, should fix that problem, and Faction Play does have the 4-mech Dropship limited respawn function, which mitigates the cost of bad luck and minor mistakes.  Regardless of how you choose to play, remember that there is integrated VOIP. Use it to figure out tactics and call targets, but try not to abuse it by spamming music or yelling obscenities. There is an in-game mute option if you encounter an abusive player, as well as an integrated report function. VOIP, if you use it, can let a group of random solos defeat a coordinated 12-man premade team.  The in-game economy is solid. There were some recent improvements to the reward structure, meaning that a moderately good performance will earn enough c-bills to purchase a new mech after only a few hours of playing, though admittedly it will vary quite a bit depending on how well you do and how expensive your target mech is. There are ways to accelerate your earnings, ranging from 1st Win double XP bonuses, to Premium Time, to Hero and Special mechs, etc. There are also frequent mech preorder packs, which usually include significant bonus items on top of the mechs themselves.  It is entirely possible to run this game well and enjoyably without spending a dime. The bulk of the possible real-money purchases are either vanity or convenience, with the only exception being the unique hardpoints of the Hero mechs (but no Gold Armor or Gold Weapons or Gold Ammo - Hero mechs use all the same gear as everything else in the game).  The game is incredible fun as-is, and there is more and better to come. Plus, it's free. There's no appreciable downside to giving it a try, and it offers a unique approach to gameplay that no other shooter can match.",

Playing occasionally since beta time - was huge hopes on this title. I understand all the time the devs putting into this game and my article so far:  This game give you fantactic experience piloting these heavy walking tank mech - yes you feel, actually you are sitting in that giant robots! Explosions, metal sounds, cockpit stuttering from impact damage make it immersive. Morels are awesome, as well as the art produced for the mechs.  This title could have so much potential being a single player AAA game (priced ~80-90 NZD). Focused gameplay with a deep story line missions. There could be some other military vehicles like tanks , helicopters ( like in original mech games).  It is very steep learning curve game with competitive slow paced gameplay. which blends perfect into simulation focused game type, it is not arcade like shooter. I am not going to talk about Community warfare ( not a dedicated to it and I am not a MW nerd). Instead I would like to touch physiological matters.  And this game pricing model in unbalanced. I understand that the developer has to make money, but in most cases animal human greed might have a bigger vote. Probably heard of golden mechs. But in sort paragraph I would like to outline simple concept for Free* to play content:  Everything take ages to grind. Have a busy real life and no time to grind: gave us your money and we well boost your digital, non-existed in reality experience and virtual currency gain. Talking about reality: the game might take YOUR hardrive space up to 12 gig, and 80 of content like all mechs, decorative trinkets and whistles that you don’t own, but the files are occupying your hard drive. Would now mind if it was all the the “cloud” to be located or if there was a simple skirmish mission mode with AI’s ( there is tutorial academy but at the moment it is not a fully single game/training grounds where you can practice and play before engaging with competitive multiplayer mode. That is just another philosophical thought… sorry. TIME = MONEY  MONEY=TIME  Developers: How could we earn some money in the digital era?  Subconscious mind: Make a video game.  Developers: But how could we earn MORE money?  Subconscious mind: Make a game with multiplayer mode.  Developers: Ok, but if we make a game, we can only sell in once.  Subconscious mind: Then just make a multiplayer game  Developers: But if we make only multiplayer based game, we need to pay for server maintenance and hosting costs? Subconscious mind: You put a lower entry price tag and make a subscription model and those players will pay for your expenses plus you would have a bit left for your rent.  Developers: Hm… Not many people are willing to pay and our servers always deserted, we need to widen our player base to populate the game. How do we lure people in?  Subconscious mind: Make “Free to play” game.  Developers: No! Are you kidding?? How are we going to rewarded with all the time we spent developing our beloved game.  Subconscious mind: I said Free as free*. That means it is not actually free but free to enter.  Developers: Ok, then we lure new customers in. The only popular way to make money is to offer microtransactions. But people hate them and it is hard to design a game and keep a balance between paying and non-paying players.  Subconscious mind: Since Pay to Win would uproar the player base, how about focusing on the time? There are a lot of impatient people… Make everything slow to get – money, experience, new content. Once you get some people happy with free content, they most likely will give you money.  Developers: So we can actually make money from them?  Subconscious mind: Yes, that is called “Milking” but you should not say that in public – say “Pre-order” ,”Support the developer”. You can offer some challenges and tournaments and evet donate some unreal digital excusive stuff to make your cattle er.. player base loyal to you. Oh and you can sell all these useless decorative digital trinkets and whistles to boost their inner ego as well , even go for VIP pre-order!”  Developers: Oh, that sound better than going a single player game. Although we have thoughts on making a game to make money once and then moving into another project, we now can do this one! So we can offer the content piece by piece and intentionally make slower progression while keeping a fun level up and for those who cannot wait they can give us money!  Subconscious mind: That is correct. Instead of dropping money once on a product, a player pays a portion after portion and less resistant to that, without realising that over the time he spent so much money exceeding any AAA game with much more content for that price.  Developers: Hm… You are right. $10+$25+$25 and $5+$5 looks far less tackling over the time than $70 straight in. Subconscious mind: You are a good learner. We should recruit more marketers into your team to help you out.  Developer: But we would like to keep a high price tag for new content we make :D  Subconscious mind: But you content costs like a good standalone game product? Is not that greedy?  Developers: Hm, but how cares! We got some fun boys already – it is for them. Oh, and we could charge people per multiplayer match. Like 100 virtual currency or vote with real money for game mode and map selection.  Subconscious mind: I think you are getting over a bit...  Developers: And we could charge them a convenience fee when they convert real money into game virtual currency. And tax for content pre-orders they will have to pay a tax for the right to pre-order the product which we are still working on! We are genius!  Subconscious mind: Oh boy, it is over the line and you start to focus on profit gaining instead of a quality for your product.  Developers: Quality product cost time and money to create. If we get the money, we can create quality product.  Inner greed: Just focus on making a profit and everything will be fine. It is just business. Game industry is just business.  Creativity: No! Money and greed kills creativity and dedication to the love of what you do…  Inner greed: Without my money, you, Creativity would not exist. You can’t create with no investment.  Creativity: But a game should be an interactive art – that how I see it.  Inner greed: Oh, do not start that topic again about what should a game industry look like – business or art! Hate it; is like what is better IOS or Android.  Conscience: Perhaps you the devs should dedicate your potential to something more useful for the humanity and live in real life and not in front of your monitor screens?  Developers: Oh, shut up all of you! You all make it hard to think about – we just concentrate earning our living with the tricks we came up here.  Conscience: But..  Developers: La-la-la, not hearing you, Bla-bla bla.  Subconscious mind: Should not have started that conversation (pacepalm). ",

When I looked at the price of the mechs, I just said no way. The Heavy Mech Timberwolf costs 15,178,647 C-Bills or 6075 MC (approximately USD 25-30) for a mech. Piranha Games really made it bad.  PROS 1. Mechas Obviously, what else are you playing this game for?  2. Maps Nice big fields of battle. Pity for the lack of zoom.  3. Movements Still clunky. They'll explain it to you. It's like moving a tank.  CONS 1. Long Load Times It takes a few minutes to connect to the Piranha games servers.  2. Pay To Win It's an obvious pay to win game. It costs USD100 (99.95) to buy 25,000 MC (The in-game cash currency). With 4000 MC, you can get 6,500,000 C-Bills (the grinding currency). The list of micro-transactions goes on and on. Remember that Pay-for-Convenience is just another terrm that the developers use to con you. It is the same as P2W. You still get an in-game advantage. Bad PR, Piranha Games.  a. Mastery Packs If you want to buy any Mastery Pack, it costs anywhere from 4325 to 10,265 MC (Atlas Mastery Pack). They come with 30 days of Premium Time.  b. Premium Time The best deal I'm assuming is 24,000 MC for 360 days of Premium Time. 30 days of Premium Time is 2500 MC. This I assume gives you +30% XP and +30% C-bills.  c. Consumable Powers You can pay cash to get super powers in the game E.g. 15MC for an UAV. These are all cash shop items.  3. No repairs Yup. Any damage sustained is permanent. So, this incentivises hiding after taking critical damage.  4. Zooming You can't zoom beyond a certain point and zoom is extremely critical. Some mechs even have zero zoom.  5. Grinding You would need to grind to level up and you would need to grind to master your mech. Thanks to CommodusIV for reminding me of the ridiculous grind.",

I can always expect to either be steamrolled or not (It really depends on which mech you're using). There are rare occasions where the battle is in both favors, but those last a long time, and I don't want to sit through it.  I've heard rumours of the game being bad initially, there are a couple things about it that make red flags but there isn't anything 'game-breaking'. This game can give better experiences with friends due to more teamwork and coordination, and it is a little different from the previous mechwarrior titles, being that this one is a PVP style game instead of the traditional PVE, but seeing how the gameplay turned out I am not really a fan of it. Mechwarrior seems to be more in favor of PVE gameplay, and definitely less mechs in a single match. I am not a big fan of sticking a large cluster of mechs on each team into one small-medium map. Maps like Alpine Peaks and Tourmaline Desert are more fitting for large-scale battles. They are in favor of LRM's due to the map size but there are definitely ways to counter this like hiding behind mountains, obstacles and using ECM.  There aren't any Pay-to-win aspects of this game (I am going to ignore the priority airstrike and artillary because it is not worth it. Seriously. You're better off upgrading your regular airstrike and artillary), and anything costing the premium currency is purely cosmetic OR, if you're in a hurry and don't want to grind, premium time or hero mechs (Basically they are mechs that have exp bonuses to help you grind easier, but in my opinion the prices on them are REDICULOUS.)  I am not discouraging you from playing this game, you can definitely try it to see if it's something you like, and if you don't like it, remember; It's free until you put money into it. I put money into this game ($15) to get some nice stuff and at the same time support the devs. The grinding in this game is absurd and having a part-time job I don't have time to grind so hard. That precious mech I wanted seems so far away without using the assistance of real-currency. Even if I did get it, the meta would've changed and the mech becomes obsolete.  For being too long and didn't read, this game in the end turned out to be something that is not my cup of tea. It could definitely be yours, but not mine. I might play it every once in a while but not by much.",

            "review_text": "I will say this game has greatly improved over time. Played it a couple years back and was sorely disappointed on the pay to win feel of it. Now not so much in that direction but if you want to catch up quickly paying feels almost necessary but not completely. All in all very well balanced and is holding alright to the source material. The faction system is new to me but not to veteran players. Being a Battletech and Mechwarrior player of old it still doesnt hold to all of the loadouts and rules but I think with the limitations holds to it very well. The game is beautiful and the mechs can be modified(somewhat).",

            "review_text": "Right. This is different from your average shooter. The learning curve is very VERY steep. Expect to die a lot at start. I've played several thousand matches, got around 60 mechs (you can either purchase them for game currency or real money if you feel the Studio does a good job - which they do) but yet the game is far from being mastered.  The studio - PGI - delivers stuff every 14 days, be it content, fixes and updates. So they're quite active, doing events quite often, the community is pretty cool (mostly). Ofc like in every other F2P Game this game has its trolls and you'll probably read the one or other negative review. Its mostly blabla, tbh.  A few tipps: Get yourself some good mechs, starting out with light mechs. Easier to learn the game on those. Don't stray from the main group. You'll most likely get fragged if you try to single-handedly win the game. Stay away from Faction Play at start, it plays completely different than Quick Play and your trial mechs won't stand a chance there. Listen to players using the VoIP and trying to coordinate your group. As a plus get into the Battletech universe. Lore-wise its one of the greatest stories told. ",

I voted for this game to win the award: The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award. I voted this because this game was what introduced me to online gaming groups and introduced me to true online gaming. It was through this game that I got my first friends online that I didnt know in real life... With these friends we had loads of fun and I learned how amazing this game truly is!",
