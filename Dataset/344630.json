And I'm even more glad to have bought Princcess Evangile on Mangagamer, since I don't like nor want to support Steams moral police actions.  Nutity and sexual content is not worse then violence and gore. You shouldn't believe otherwise.",

            "review_text": "To be honest this is my first review even though I've only done one route of it. So please dont slander me   Ill get over the pros and cons Pros: - Incredibly well done story (The drama is real is this one) - Characters that will melt your heart ( Voice acting was amazing ) - Jokes are actually good - The Art of the game is amazing - Sound effect were on point  Cons: - Wished there were 'animations' per say - No nudity involved (Ya damn pervs.)  Thats about it for the pros and cons, but where do i start the review? I'll just write a simple one then, The Story? Your a borderline unsocial jackass went it comes to girls (seriously there are moments so cringy on how he did not realize what the girls were talking about) that tries to save an all girls school from going bankrupt by changing it into co-education, sounds hard? Yes it is. With me playing 30 or more hours into it just means you are in for a ride. The characters (Main or even Side characters) they all had influence into the story, not just blatant side characters that just appears for chit chat and random moments, no they all actually have a point in the story. The routes are only 4 from this one. Im not complaining since each route really has a touching story to each girl, whether it being your old friend, your saviour, your enemy, or just a seductive older women that likes to tease you alot. The plot twists are incredible in it aswell like truly 'a holy **** ' moment. And then there was the ending. I cried. Seriously i did. Just to put it simply the drama ride you took and it ends all in perfect climax, it just hurts right in feels.  So should you buy this game? Yes, preferably on sale   Is it a great game? It is for me. Opinions of others do count, but yours is to find out yourselves.  How much would you rate it? 9.8/10, due to the fact it didnt have animations to it. (Also nudes were cut out, perverts)  And thats my review thanks for reading my random opinion about this wonderful game!",

But I was pleasantly surprised by a vibrant and excellently writted cast of characters. Each route is very well fleshed out and incredibly well written. A incredibly well rounded story even to the end. Personally my favorite route was Ayaka. Parts of it was absolutely heart wrenching, which is proof it was a great story to me. A disclosure though I recieved this game for free, so I may be a bit biased. Will stand the test of time!",

            "review_text": "Phenomenal VN with a very well written story. There may be some characters that will make you want to punch your screen, but that's a good testatment to how well the characters' lines are delivered. Art and BGM are great as well, as they enhance the story nicely.  With that said, the biggest selling point of this game (to me) was the story. There are moments that made me cry with laughter and moments that made me furious. Going into this game, I had expected a typical harem-like story, but upon finishing the routes, I realized it was much more than that.  Each route is unique in its own story, so that makes replaying the game quite enjoyable, as there are always new things to engage in.  Only gripe is that there's no route for Ruriko :(  Overall though, this is easily in my Top 3 VNs.",

            "review_text": "I just finished my first playthrough and went with Ayaka's path.  I want to start with the negatives first. You don't have a lot of choices really, even though it would have been only minor things, I would have enjoyed more options. As it stands most chapters just roll on without your input. I have not played the other stories, so the next part may only apply to Ayaka. You get a really good build up to choosing which girl to date, but after that it feels like every other character just falls out of the novel to make minor appearances occasionally. It's obvious that your girl becomes your focus, but you don't really see interactions with the other girls anymore. Even though it might have padded the story I think it would have been nice to see Masaya talk to the other girls without his girlfriends invloment more, that way they don't feel so tossed aside. That's especially true considering the pace picks up a lot in the last few months.  I'm also not a big fan of Ayaka's ending story-wise, it just feels a little forced. It's probably a lot different in Rise's path, but the Grand Vote was a huge disappointment, being really only a side in Ayaka's path, even though it was built up really well before the girl choice.  But I really enjoyed this VN. It has great art, the character's are believable and their motivations appear to make sense. It's well written and it did what I want out of such a story: It made me care about the characters, quite frankly more than I anticipated.  I will probably not play it for a while, just so I can do some other things, but I have three other stories to read, even though I was more than happy with my choice.",

From the art, music, voices, plot... its really worth the $$ especially since its not a short novel series. i bought it during anime fair so its slightly cheaper than the current price and it comes with a lovely file. no matter your gender, if u like it, u like it.  The only downside is... not all the in-game girls r date-able. For example Ruriko who appeared more than Ritsuko, isn't one of the choices, that somewhat saddens me. Although ''W Happiness' version, which is not on steam, will have the other girls as well as the 4 current girls  And make sure U Always choose the girl you want because at chapter 16, its sort of a deciding factor whether u will lose the game or not..",
