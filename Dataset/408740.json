            "review_text": "Hello, this is my first serious review.  I'm an avid gamer and dedicate most of my free time to gaming and checking out titles that could be cool and fun.  Pro Gamer Manager did have an appeal at the start... same Game Dev Tycoon art... managing your own eSports team... so I figured the mechanics would be similar, thus, making it a fun and entertaining experience. I was wrong.  I can see the devs tried to make an entertaining title, but the formula does not work. In MANAGING GAMES you want to see that the decisions and actions you take, affect the outcome of the matches whether in a good or bad way. But when you play Pro Gamer Manager, the decisions you make, affect the outcomes in a really vague way or they don't affect it in any way and are unable to change its outcome.   You never know or are told (at least give us a hint of how the mechanics work for god's sake) how things are going to affect your results. You can pickup styles and different tactics but they are really vague on how you should use them and really basic. They try to make it simple but making it that way just takes away the whole experience of being a Professional eSports team.  Even if the devs assume you're used and knowledged about MOBA or FPS games, it's difficult to figure out what to do in every situation, even with Trial and Error. I might be wrong if I say that the decisions you take as a manager or a player DO NOT affect the outcome BUT; when I played Pro Gamer Manager I always felt that way and, believe me, IT IS NOT A PLEASANT FEELING.  I really tried to find something redeeming and have fun with Pro Gamer Manager, but either I haven't tried hard enough (prob not) or the game in itself isn't fun, probably the latter.  It also has some bugs that are not gamebreaking or really important, but they are really simple and basic bugs that kind of break the experience too (16-15 as a valid victory result on a FPS match even if it's not meant to be CS, can't click too fast on incoming messages or they will delete themselves).  Pro Gamer Manager defeats its own purpose as a game and a managing game, such potential wasted because of a bad execution.  I wouldn't recommend to buy this game in its current state, it's basically not fun for me and I've requested a refund.",

            "review_text": "Great concept, poor execution.  As someone who enjoys management games, this looked like an interesting take on the genre, being that I enjoy MOBA games and the pro scene centered around them. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no substance to the game. Your stats and attributes mean nothing. You can max out your character and still lose to players far worse than you. To make matters worse, there is little to no feed back as to why you lost. Maybe you picked the wrong champ, maybe you picked the wrong playstyle, you'll never really know.  To make matters worse, the Devs seem to have abandoned the MOBA side of the game in favor of the FPS side, which I have no interest in, and its not that much better from what I hear.  The game is playable, but its all random. Not worth picking up until some major updates are made, and from the looks of things, thats going to be a loooooong ways away.",

Sadly you have to play around and experiment over and over to try and see what works. When you do this though a lot of the results are so random that even when you do the exact same thing you get opposite results. Overall I wouldn't play the game again and actually got a refund for it. If they fixed these issues I may consider trying it again but it seems unlikely.",

Really, Really, needs a skip or spped up button. I usualy just watch a video and check on the game every 2 mins to see if my team won or not. Also not very interactive, and probably should have a tutorial aswell. Still quite enjoyable, but this could have been alot more.",

Theses guys must not know how to play, etc.' Well now I wish i could get my refund.  The Dev of this game had a decent idea, but the way the game works is flawed. Especially in 'FPS' mode. In FPS you need to be able to control more aspects of the way your guy/team plays the game. Same in Foba. Also; -The Way you win games seems like there is a patter but there isnt -The Lack of in game choices on both player level and Manager level is appalling:You have game swhere you do nothing in player or seemingly randomly switch between Aggressive, Normal, and Defensive in manager - if the basis for FPS is CSGO, then the DEV has never watched a pro game much less played it at a even a GN level.  -Stats Don't seem to matter at all, nor is there a way to know what they do.  Game has a good premise and seems to try a bit, but needs more interactivity. As it is now it is a button pressing simulator. No strategy, no brains, no customization, no thrill: Just buttons.",

Unfortunatelly, after ~ 1-2hrs of gameplay you don't have anything else to do except doing things to get more money, without having any real options to spend it on.  Especially after having reached rank 1 in career mode...after that, all I had to do was stop playing matches (without losing rank) and stream stuff (to gengerate more money).  On top of that, the outcome of most of the actions available ingame like changing tactics, training, watching different streams feel completely random. Sometimes you lose games, some time you win games but it's hard to tell why you've won or lost respectively.    It starts out fantastic and fun but gets boring real fast.  I'll keep my eyes open on this game and see what the future holds for it, but I would be even more disappointed if I wouldn't have bought it when it was on sale.",

Overall worth it. Tons of replay value as you can play four full games, either player or manager under each genre. Unfortunately there are no achievements or cards, please add them soon!",
