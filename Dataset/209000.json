            "review_text": "Arkham Asylum was a revolutionary game. Arkham City was as well. By contrast, Arkham Origins is viewed as an evolutionary game, and between that and the fact that the principal actors and development studio have been replaced a lot of people figured 'eh, I don't need to play this for a year.' Technically speaking, Arkham Origins does feature revolutionary additions over the previous games, but it's in an area that nobody particularly asked for in the first place: online competitive multiplayer. I myself have yet to even launch it, but given that it's developed by Splash Damage I'm sure it's not slapped together. They did after all make the Return to Castle Wolfenstein multiplayer (which got carried over into Enemy Territory, and then Quake Wars, etc).  The thing about the single-player is that while it's good, you literally cannot help but compare it against Arkham City the entire time. The combat system and animations are completely carried over, with some additions. You have some new gadgets (one is allegedly 'new' but in reality is functionally identical to something else from Arkham City) and face a few new common foes. Luckily, one of the gadgets is straight out of Super Inframan and makes combat even more satisfying since you trounce everyone with it, and the others give you more options during the Predator encounters. The enemy AI is altered since the rate at which you counter rather than strike has gone way, way up. Boss battles are VASTLY improved over the previous games, as each one emphasizes that you do different things. At no point do you feel 'well, this is the same thing I did for the last boss.'  But even with that said, at most points you DO feel 'well, I've done this before.' Aside from the combat, the sidequests have you doing the same gameplay mechanic as 2 years ago (and 4 years ago) albeit for a different cosmetic reason. Example: in Arkham City you have to quickly travel across the city to answer phones in time to stop a killer. Here, you have to do the same to defuse bombs. It's the same map as Arkham City, albeit with some new zones. It helps a little that you can now fast travel. But there must be fewer grapple points because getting from place to place is a little trickier than it used to be.   You'll be fighting and fighting, and with the random 'crimes in progress' that spawn, you'll fight more. You're rarely going to be scanning the environment unless you're prompted to do so. Crime scene investigations are a new addition, but much like the show CSI you aren't really doing anything yourself. The computer is magically reconstructing a series of events based on your having scanned a body and a spot of blood (which they can't show as red). Then you go beat up a guy. You can't inadvertently defeat the person you meant to interrogate either, so there's no 'save this guy for last' aspect to combat. But you are now given grades for each encounter, such that higher grades yield XP bonuses. Winning is largely a foregone conclusion given that you're Batman, but winning with an A or S rank is the tough part. In fact, I still haven't gotten the last one because it doesn't always play the *wham* sound effect to denote you KO'ed someone with a hit (I call this the 'BATMAAAAAN!' since if I could mod this game I would replace that sound with the screaming pug). The game offers various challenges for additional bonuses and upgrades, but it's buggy about deciding whether or not some of them 'count.' I busted my ♥♥♥ doing the 'do 4 exotic takedowns in a Predator section' and then it didn't count it. And then it turned out there were no more Predator sections in the game. AND it won't let you complete those challenges on the challenge maps, so if you don't do it during the story you're screwed...unless you replay it on the much harder New Game+ mode...  The reduced architecture grapples and increased enemy attack rates are somewhat minor, but if there's a major 'step backwards' here it's one of atmosphere. This Gotham City isn't yet overrun with supervillains who've marked their territory and themed their gangs. The incentive to see the world isn't really as strong. The Riddler's challenges were designed to direct you to all the cool little references, but at this point there is no 'Riddler' etc so you're basically completing the challenges for the sake of hearing the 'extortion data that's going to harm innocent people' recordings. Except pretty much all of them pertain to supervillains and corrupt civil servants whom you take down anyway. It feels more like a task since there's less 'reward' for doing it. Why oppose this so strongly? That's the REAL enigma.  The strong negative online backlash to Arkham City's criminal dialogue means that EVERYTHING pertaining to threats or abusive language is long gone (that already got walked back since the Arkham City DLC) so pat yourselves on the back, Team Social Justice. Between that and the fact that Batman is less infallible at this stage of his career, the writing has gotten a lot more praise compared to Arkham City. But for me, it feels less satisfying to beat people up because I overheard them saying they're cold and hungry, or that they're resorting to crime because they lost their job and now they have to not be home on Christmas Eve. This definitely plays into the 'Batman as fascist authoritarian conservative' reading of the character. I kind of wonder if the writers just hate Batman as a concept, since the villains all expose the flaws in his approach and morality and Batman has no answer because he can't admit 'the reason I can't kill you is because you're all too profitable as IP.'  Also, the game takes place over a few hours on Christmas Eve into Christmas Day, yet the amount that happens is absurd. True, a lot happened during Arkham City, but there was planning leading up to it. How can these locations be THIS devastated and re-renovated in just a few hours? And it's not even accidental; the game points out 'yeah, it's been 3 hours.' On the other hand, James Gordon isn't Commissioner yet, so the cops are pretty much all dirty. In this game you get to beat up SWAT team guys, which is the part of 'Year One' that is the most important.   The Assassin's Creed guy as Batman has his highs and mids since he's mostly forced to imitate Kevin Conroy, but with a name like 'Roger Smith' you'd think he was BORN to impersonate Kevin Conroy's Batman! Troy Baker (who already nailed his Richard Moll Two-Face impersonation in Arkham City) is about as dead-on a mimicry of Mark Hamill's Joker as one could hope, given that Mark can no longer really do that voice anymore. Richard Epcar (voice of the Joker in the fighting games) has a few background lines that jump out to me, but I guess he also directed a lot of the secondary dialogue recordings.  I enjoyed Arkham Origins, but I'd still say to hold off on getting it. Not so much because of the issues described above so much as the fact that there's a ton of DLC and all of it's spread out across platforms and retailers due to exclusivity (Challenge maps where you're Bruce Wayne in training, etc). There's a Season Pass which includes that stuff, but it costs another $20 and for now is almost entirely cosmetic. They say there'll be at least one story DLC, but what'll it be about? Maybe something inspired by The Long Halloween? I don't know, so I don't know if that, a few challenge maps, and some cosmetic skins are really worth the money. For now I'd say to pick this up once a 'complete edition' is available unless you happen to buy a new video card that bundles it.",

            "review_text": "Arkham Origins is a great game with a very bad launch which makes it underratred. Different studio on an Arkham game means a different aproach, which in this case turned out to be a solid job. The gameplay is now brutal, there are more gadgets, the city is bigger and colder, the story feel more alive and the soundtrack helps making it all epic. The STORY is well written, has many epic moments and does it job at keeping you entertained and keeping your interest in, which is great considering it's a prequel. In this game, Batman is in his early days, fighting both criminality and law. In the night you're playing, 8 assassins mean to kill, all organized by the man behind a mask. There are characters like Joker, Bane, but new, even unheard ones from the past games, like Deathstroke, Firefly, and Shiva. The main story is great and the sidequests are a joy to do(only there you'll confront some of the assassins) The GAMEPLAY is brutal, fun and challanging on hard. Having more gadgets and moves keeps things fresh for an Arkahm veteran. There are regular thugs, armored thughs, brutes, martial artists, thughs with shields and armed thughs and there is a gadget, a move for each one of them. You have the dark knight system, which challanges you to do different things and gives you rewards which consists in upgrades and experience. The challange room is fun to play, but it should be approached after most of the upgrades are aquired. There is also a new game plus and new to the series, 'I am the night' mode, which is the ultimate challange. The MULTIPLAYER is totally enjoyable. There are some things that tie in with the singleplayer, but aside from that, you can play as Batman or Robin, or you can be part of Joker or Bane's gang. Being a hero means intimidating both gangs, before they one kills the other and captures every point. You can even play as Joker or Bane, if you are the lucky thug to open the door for them. GRAPHICS are stunning, the game being the best looking Arkham to date. Also the texture models are a real eyecandy. It has the innovative thing of snow getting deformed at your movement, which is something available for every type of video card.  The BUGS are solved now, haven't experienced any, but a crash while hitting the exit button. Gamebreaking bugs are solved now, but there are still some to report some problems. All in all, Batman Arkham Origins is a great game that does it's job of making you feel like Batman, a must own for every gamer, since right now it's the great game that you can enjoy. Even though I lost fate in this game after hearing the bad things about it, it turned out to be one of the games I couldn't stoped playing.The score I give it is 9.5",

            "review_text": "Let's start with the short review: The third entry in the Arkham franchise is good, but it's also superfluous. If you're looking for more Arkham, then by all means don't skip this game. That's what I was looking for when I started Origins, and I wasn't disappointed. I consider this game superfluous because it really doesn't do anything better than Arkham City. Indeed, in some cases it's pretty lacking.   And now for the long review: The story to Arkham Origins is...well I'll be vague here. There's a bounty on the Dark Knight's head and eight villains are looking to collect. It's up to the player to put a stop to this nonsense and save the day. The pacing and story are a bit uneven, with a number of segments feeling like they're not really going anywhere. There's a distinct lack of great set-pieces, those moments that really define the Batman experience. That's not to say there isn't any, but they tend to get clumped together. It's like wow give me a chance to breathe here. There are even a couple objectives that seem to exist, solely to make sure Batman is in a particular place, so it doesn't break the next objective. Still the story definitely has its moments, the characters are well-done, and by the end I had a good sense of what WB Montreal was going for with the plot.  Next up there is the city. On one hand I like that unlike Arkham City, Gotham doesn't have The Riddler's ????? fetish on display around every corner. His trademark riddles are around, but they blend in a bit better with the surroundings. It's less guady, which counts for a lot. There are some nice details throughout the city. Overall though I can't say I'm too fond of it. Arkham City's..uh...city is more stylized, which is understandable since its villainous inhabitants have dressed it up to fit their personality. Still, I was expecting something a bit more gothic and ornate. There are elements of that and yet sometimes the city can look just plain. Aside from the aesthetics, Arkham City simply had a better design and 'flow' to it. It felt like more time was spent creating a slice of Gotham that the player could really move around in. Origins on the other hand, can feel just a little bit clunky.   Then there is the combat. The Arkham games are divided into two styles of action. There are the melee-oriented 'Vigilante' brawls and the stealthy 'Predator' rooms. The goal is typically to defeat all the bad guys, with better experience rewards doled out to stylish players who take advantage of Batman's numerous abilities and gadgets. WB Montreal has done a fine job with both styles. In some cases the brawls aren't quite as tight, and I've had some odd dropped combos, but nothing really stands out as poor. Predator encounters are pretty much 1:1 with the previous Arkham games. There are also the occasional boss-fights, which can take elements from the core styles, or be a little unique.  Now then, the big complaint I have with Origins is that they didn't really add anything new. There are a handful of new gadgets for handling Batman's foes, but nothing really inventive. There's the shock gloves sure, but they're ridiculously strong. They chew through every possible defense and add to the combo multiplier at a rapid rate. As fans are well aware, successful vigilante is constantly changing things up, using all of Batman's maneuvers, and keeping a flawless combo going. The gloves simplify things a bit too much. Batman also gets a few new gadgets for his predator encounters, including the ability to string up three criminals to gargoyles from a safe distance. They're not nearly as overpowered, but I have to restrain myself just a bit more to keep things from getting too easy.  Of course this is all balanced by the bad guys getting a bunch of new equipment....right? Oh, oh no. This is where the lack of fresh content sticks out. There really aren't any new types of bad guys, nor are any new methods developed to help them spot Batman when he's stalking them. Everyone is still wielding bats or pipes, late-game guys get stun batons, and it's certain they'll get the bright idea to carry riot shields or car doors around. The combat is still good, but it's just more of the same.  This feeling of sameness extends to other moments in Arkham Origins. An encounter with Deadshot is oddly reminiscent of the final battle between Catwoman and Two-face, the boss-fight with Firefly is eerily similar to the one with Poison Ivy back in Arkham Asylum. As these battles play out I get that familiarity that really shouldn't be there. It's difficult to feel that sense of accomplishment when there's a little voice in the back of my brain saying 'What are you celebrating about? You've done this before.' The names and locations change, but too many other elements don't.  As far as concerns the rest of Arkham Origins content. There is the usual collection of vigilante and predator challenge maps, additional playable characters, and...multiplayer? I'll be brutally honest here, I played one multiplayer match, and that was it. What can I say? I'm not much of a competitive MP person. The multiplayer seems to be retaining its popularity well, as I got into a full match within seconds of starting up. Honestly I'd be satisfied with something a bit more simple and direct, Batman &amp; Robin teaming up to put the hurt on some thugs. Maybe there could be some more advanced vigilante and predator maps to keep things balanced.   All in all, despite Arkham Origins not really doing anything new or improving on its predecessors, I still recommend it. Why? Simply because it's more Arkham. Yes, really, that's absolutely it. Am I shallow or what? Rocksteady struck gold when they developed Arkham Asylum. Now they have a model that can be applied to any and all future Batman games and I'm likely to eat it up everytime. As long as the quality remains at moderately-high level I'll remain a fan. Although I hope that with Rocksteady developing the next game, they include a slew of fresh game-design changes and additions. If the fifth Arkham game turns out to be a retread, I hope it's at least a retread of Arkham Knight and not Arkham City.",

Combat was fantastic and using many gadgets during a big fight makes it even more fun.    The story takes place five years before the events of Arkham Asylum , and batman haven't yet met the joker , and this game is mainly based on their first meeting, which was interesting and there were many villains , most of them were Assassins who were after the bounty of 50 million put on batman's head by Black Mask   Joker actually   . And this game has some of the coolest boss fights among the entire Arkham series, like the Deathstroke fight was awesome, I mean it was not much of a challenge but felt like a cinematic experience with a lot of QTEs, and other great boss fights include the Bane and firefly, others were just OK!    Didn't play much of the multiplayer, my experience was mediocre at best and as many have said before, it felt unnecessary but it would have been great if more effort was put into it.

            "review_text": "Arkham Origins is, unfortunately, sort of the black sheep of the Arkham Games. What with it not being made by Rocksteady while they worked on Arkham Knight, Origins was put out by Splash Damage Studios instead. And it is, to some degree, underrated. While Arkham Asylum was excellent and Arkham City was good, Origins falls further behind and winds up in the realm of 'Better than average', but it is still decent. Everything you liked about Arkham Asylum or Arkham City is still here, mostly. The problem is that Origins somewhat coasts off the success of the Asylum and City, and suffers from a lack of any new cards to throw down.  On the gameplay front, combat has been improved once again, but it's gotten around to where it has inevitably become repetitive. And the entire map does feel somewhat lazily designed, as no less than half of it is copied over from Arkham City, right down to the Steel Mill section. Side missions are also making their return, although not quite as much of a spectacle. What is new is the crime scene missions, which are a welcome addition using Batman's crime reconstruction technology, although the number of them makes them go on a bit too long and a bit too short each to be truly entertaining. Boss fights haven't been copied, but as a result they're worse than City or Asylum and fail to do anything as impressive as the Mr. Freeze fight from City. Hunting down Deadshot and Riddler are also almost exactly the same from the previous games. Really, on the gameplay side, there isn't much to talk up. It's basically an expansion for Arkham City.  The story is where Arkham Origins finds a good place. Asylum played much more like a comic book and did quite well in its niche, but City tried to take a darker turn without changing Asylum's formula of 'Villain X is doing Y. Go to location Z and beat them up', and therefore suffered for anyone who tried to take it seriously. While Origins doesn't do much to shake that up that formula, it actually explores the relationships of both Batman and one of his biggest enemies, which both its predecessors failed to do. The character arcs affect the plot much more than they did in the previous games, and so with that, Origins takes that successful dark step up that City tried to take but misstepped somewhat. The main plot thread does hop back and forth between side stories a bit too much, but it's not that noticable, and its enjoyable while it lasts. The voice actors also do a very good job filling the shoes of their predecessors, and one villain's VA who I won't mention did such a fantastic job that I didn't realize until halfway through the game that the character's actor had changed.  If you liked the previous Arkham games, you'll find pretty much everything you liked here, and maybe something you haven't seen before as well. That being said, while Origins doesn't do anything that made me want to punch the developers in the face, it didn't make me want to sing their praises either. There's nothing really new it can bring to the table, although it does make better developments in the story department by making characters more three-dimensional and making them more important to the plot. I'd pick it up on a sale if you aren't 100% convinced, but Origins isn't not worth your time, and it does no dishonor to the name of the Arkham franchise.",

            "review_text": "Batman's consistently made the shadows his associate, however in Batman: Arkham Origins, he finds the shadow of his own past beguilements difficult to escape from. It's like Batman: Arkham City from numerous perspectives, having gotten a remarkable battle framework, regardless it needs beguiling thoughts of its own, and it's slant the loss of the clean and exactingness that makes Arkham City and Arkham Asylum exceptional development entertainments.   Its name, 'Arkham Origins,' is a ludicrous misnomer - it might be a prequel, yet this story is neither about Arkham, nor is it a beginning story in any essential way. It's extensively more a common Batman plot that retreads a parcel of The Dark Knight's most unmistakable subjects over its around eight hours of focal story content: a self-dangerous complement on working alone, and how far he'll go to abstain from completing a nearness - an idea the last fight wisely toys with. It's a respectable plot that even thinks about a conceivable elucidation behind Batman to face such a combination of delinquents all in one night – a $50 million wealth on his head. In any case, it's the sort of prequel that hollers 'What were we accepting when we butchered off that staggeringly clearly comprehended character? Change! Change!'   This more lively Batman beginning now has all his check moves and mechanical gathering, flies some plane, and is on a first-name present with in every way that really matters every misrepresentation beside The Joker. So at the cost of truly offering these occasions happen going before the other two preoccupations, Origins keeps the establishment of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City's stunning battle set up, joining each device alive and well. (Mr. Keep's nonattendance from the revolt's show surmises the cryo-explosives are immediately control blackout or paste shots.)   Two new adversary sorts switch it up, broadly the military powers who can counter your assaults. Regardless, the principal amazing change is an uncommon little something that is splendid shockingly you utilize it, however rapidly uncovers itself as a dreadful thought. The Shock Gauntlets are among the last mechanical gathering you open, which is inconceivable, in light of the way that once charged (by hitting a couple people in solid battle) and actuated, they let you completely expel everything that makes battle intriguing. Revolt shields, daze twirly doos, defensively secured offenders – Batman just punches them. They're on an exceptionally essential level a win get, and the sort of thing that doesn't work in a prequel in light of the way that why may Batman ever dispose of them?   By then, in the stealth battles where Batman picks off furnished criminals one by one, there's another to some degree unsanitary feeling win get: a remote associate that strings convicts without them in spite of walking around a mammoth. I got myself intentionally keeping up an imperative partition from both of those contraptions, since I'm not in this to not battle blameworthy gatherings.   Out in the extended and snow-secured open world, I discovered Gotham City delightful yet lethargic. In Arkham City, the reason is that this some parcel of town has been walled off and given to the wrongdoers. Without that (in fact stunning) situation, the nonappearance of any comprehension of non military staff life makes Gotham feel horrifyingly vain, particularly near to Origins' open-world partners and their populated lanes. It might be the point of convergence of the night on Christmas Eve, yet roads swarming with just unequivocally un-cheerful lawbreakers are still abnormal.   For visual characteristic, the new wrongdoing scene examinations are staggering, and take the 'zoom and upgrade!' saying to new extremes. Utilizing the shoulder gets the opportunity to clean through an extended reality diversion of occasions looks amazing, yet it's specific scarcely common; whatever you do is locate the going with (sign: the thing's highlighted for you) when influenced and assess it to get the going with bit of the confound – no vital organization included. It's a transcendent, showier utilization of Detective Mode than Asylum or City considered, yet meanwhile, it's only for appear. Precisely when utilizing the Wii U Gamepad, you're supported (however not obliged) to utilize the LCD as a viewfinder and control the essential individual point of view camera with the improvement controls instead of the sticks, which is awkward and gimmicky.   This is the central Batman joy to have multiplayer (on all stages with the exception of Wii U), and the eight-player mode feels like a first draft. Generally you're playing an ordinary third-particular shooter in which your three-man hoard goes after zone control focuses with an adversary pack. The turn is that two other self-decisively picked players are Batman and Robin (who doesn't show up in the battle) picking individuals on both sides off utilizing Predator mode moves and a to an exceptional degree ungainly sort of the single-player battle. Frankly, it's a genuinely sharp thought – I do like how when I'm doing fighting different crooks I ought to be unpleasant of a legend sneaking up behind me, and when I'm looking toward the figure of characteristic roosts trying to shoot down a blessed individual a criminal is in all likelihood going to shoot me in the back. In like manner, two sacred individuals taking part can oversee utilizing marvelous Batman-utilizes a-minor-as-a-redirection frameworks. In any case, given the unremarkable shooting mechanics, the multiplayer mode is a peculiarity that I wouldn't plan to get more than a few sessions out of. Wii U proprietors aren't missing much here.   Batman distractions take after pizza: in spite of when they're dreadful, they're still extremely exceptional. By Arkham City, Arkham Origins is reasonably a mistake in its nonattendance of new contemplations and utilization of win finds, making it the base interesting of the game plan of three. By and by, as inspirations to jump over into the awesome free-spilling battle and predator takedowns go, this story isn't repulsive.

            "review_text": "SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN REVIEW ONLY.  Let's cut to the chase and face it - Batman: Arkham Origins is 'more of the same', for the most part. It's basically more Batman: Arkham Asylum + Arkham City. If you were a fan of the two previous Arkham games and wanted basically more Batman: Arkham, then Origins certainly delivers just that. If that sounds good to you, great - you'll probably feel right at home with this title. If you wanted and expected more - well, prepare to be disappointed.  Arkham Origins' voice-acting is still pretty good, even with some of the changes in some of its cast members. Regardless - the cast delivers and does a great job on their performances. While the story does take a little bit for it to get rolling, once it does - it finally decide to get good. Eight assassins are basically coming for Batman's head, as there's a bounty of $50 million on Batman's head from Black Mask. That's just the start of things, to say the least. There's certainly more to it than that. Because of such a huge cast of characters and some twists + turns in the plot and storyline, some characters - like some of the lesser known Batman villains to most non-fans of the series - never really get the time to get explored and shine here, which feels like a missed opportunity. Some of Origins' story fills in the blanks of what happened to certain characters, how they become the character they become, or talk about some of their past - explaining some things that happened before events of the previous Arkham games. B/c this is an Origins story, it feels like some of this should've been explored a bit more.  If you loved the combat of Arkham Asylum + City, it's not really changed much here - and this definitely has always been one of the strengths of this series. Some of the combat feels tweaked, here and there. Plus, there are some new weapons and gadgets here. One of the best things here are the boss fights - which are always excellent here. There certainly are plenty of side missions and collect-a-thon's here, for fans to dive into - if they are digging the game. And if that isn't enough, there's a New Game Plus Mode, among other things to dive into.  After 23 hours approximately, Batman: Arkham Origins' single player campaign deliver basically more Batman: Arkham. Fans of the series wanting more Batman: Arkham, that's exactly what you receive here. If you were expecting more, innovations, and major improvements - don't! Origins is not that title. If you want more Batman: Arkham, you'll come away happy with this title. It's certainly a solid game and delivers such an experience. Origins certainly does not touch the greatness and freshness that came from the previous two titles developed by Rocksteady. Though, it can't be denied that WB Montreal has put forth a solid Batman: Arkham game. Fans of the series wanting more Batman: Arkham, that's exactly what you receive here. If you were expecting more, innovations, and major improvements - don't! Origins is just not that title.  Final Grade = C+.",

I enjoyed my time here and got some good mileage out of the game, but Arkham City and Arkham Asylum are incredible compared to this. It is worth a five to ten dollar purchase, and you'll have a good time with it, but it feels hollow compared to Asylum/City.

            "review_text": "As a young studio best known for porting Batman: Arkham City to Wii U, WB Montreal must have been desperate to prove that it belongs in the same conversation as series creator Rocksteady Games. To its credit, it's hard to tell that Batman: Arkham Origins isn't one of its sister studio's earlier releases. That's some achievement, but it's also a mixed blessing.  To begin with, the set-up is as economical as Arkham Asylum or Arkham City. Batman is thrust into Gotham on Christmas Eve after Black Mask puts a $50 million bounty on his head and invites eight super-villains to town to compete for the spoils. As with previous Arkham games, that simple set-up then evolves as Batman races to keep up with events.  Arkham Origins doesn't leave the strongest first impression though. After a CG cutscene and a short playable prologue in Blackgate Prison, Batman is dumped into a sparsely occupied Gotham that looks tiny on his Batcomputer map compared to some of the open-world playgrounds we've run around in lately. You're free to travel across it all from the start, but players used to maps dripping with icons may be surprised at its cold emptiness.  This isn't a game that lacks depth, though - it's just a game with rare patience. Story missions take place away from the streets in carefully knotted set-piece levels built around single locations - like Penguin's hidden casino-♥♥♥-arms-bazaar or Gotham City Police headquarters - and as you make progress the open world gradually fills up with distractions.  The initial slow burn is welcome, anyway, because it's an opportunity to luxuriate in the wonderful systems and mechanics that Arkham Origins inherits from its forebears. Batman glides through levels even when he's just walking around, those famous bat ears erect with authority, and he moves fluidly in a crouched run, too, barrel-like thighs pumping him from shadow to vent. But when you start actually gliding, it's a minor revelation, opening his wings to the wind and using the grapple to grasp the edge of a distant chimney, reeling it in and launching him over the crest to continue his flight.   Watch me play through the first level of Arkham Origins and provide an overview of some of the systems. We had all this before, of course, but you forget how good it was. The same goes for Batman's many gadgets. You start off with quite a few - batarangs, smoke pellets and explosive gel for blowing holes in walls - and of course you have detective vision, the sonar view mode that maps Batman's surroundings so he can track enemies as they move nervously through the darkness around him. You gain other toys at intervals, including the remote batclaw for setting up tightropes between particular grapple points.  Batman remains handy in a fight, too. In hand-to-hand combat, a single attack button allows him to flow between targets, ducking and diving through dense matrices of incoming blows, repelling those that threaten to land by reaching for the counter button. It's still quick to build combos, and the final blow, which the game always puts into slow motion and frames up nicely, often has a satisfying crack to it.  The one thing Batman still lacks is a gun or grenade to deal with unsuspecting groups of enemies from afar - he can either wade in with his fists and gizmos or try to isolate and pick them off using stealth - but of course that's the point of the character. There is still a slight frustration though that the game often forces you into direct confrontation rather than letting you choose your own approach, especially as tougher enemies arrive with riot shields, knives and body armour to inject complexity into each fight.  Still, that is what Arkham Asylum and Arkham City did, so at least it's canon. As is the way the city starts to fill up with intriguing diversions. The Riddler is back, of course, custodian of unlockable fast-travel points that can only be activated when you break into them. This often involves hopping around adjacent buildings examining the exterior of your prize, like a high-tech octopus feeling around the outside of a bottle to reach the fish inside. Enigma has left his mark in other areas of Gotham, too, and you'll be on his various trails all night.  He is probably the highlight of the side missions - again, as usual - although he's far from alone in the dark night. Anarky is fed up with Gotham's corrupt rulers and plans to deal with them somewhat more explosively than Batman, so that's a thing, and there are various other threads to follow once secondary characters - friends and foes - present themselves.  2 Manoeuvring around enemies to set up stealth takedowns is still fun, although you can autopilot a lot of it with two games' experience under your utility belt. So it's fun crawling over Gotham. It can still feel slightly empty at times - you'll never see a pedestrian who isn't a cheesy thug or a trigger-happy SWAT team member - but among the dark rooftops, smokestacks, red brick facades and Ace Chemicals billboards there emerges plenty to do, and I am loath to scold a game for rebelling against the fad of instant gratification. Besides, some of it is there from the start should you be paying attention. There are a host of character-building challenges to complete, for example, by doing things like performing certain combinations in combat or gliding through rings dotted around the city. These tasks are just sitting there quietly listed in one of the pause menus.  The one area where Arkham Origins truly distinguishes itself from Rocksteady's work, of course, is the part of the game that UK studio Splash Damage developed: multiplayer.  In Arkham Origins' online mode, three of Bane's mercenaries face off against three of Joker's gang across four maps, fighting over capture points and trying to kill the opposition until they no longer have any Battlefield-style respawn tickets left and can be wiped out.  As well as limited-use knockoff versions of Batman's see-through-walls detective vision, and loadouts that can be customised with unlockable weapons and abilities such as an explosive RC blimp, each team can also call on their master when they hit a certain threshold. Bane has powerful melee attacks, while Joker has a pair of pistols good for one-shot kills and spamming explosives.  The biggest twist, though, is that two other players control a third team of heroes. Yes! Someone gets to play as Batman! (And Robin.) The heroes have a suite of predatory tools including grapple hooks and various batarangs and can stalk their prey from underground passages as well. They are rewarded for performing a variety of takedowns.  Despite the competing objectives, matches are simple to understand and often draw to a nervous conclusion, as Bane and Joker's teams run out of respawn tickets and try to pick each other off while the heroes circle. If a player takes out a hero at this stage, their downed team-mates retake the field, while heroes who die in this endgame lose much of their score.  Things can yo-yo very quickly, and while this can mean that the preceding drama feels as though it's more for show than anything, it's tense and exciting every time, and really does result in gang members waving their guns around at the shadows in terror, just as it should.  It's a fair amount of fun, then, but it's also the kind of mode you will enjoy for an evening rather than a lifetime. Taken on those terms, it's a welcome inclusion. They also feed into Batman's tech tree, although this is one of the weaker areas of Arkham Origins. Batman is already well outfitted and his most useful additions - like the shock gloves, which allow him to power up electrical items and rain fizzly blows down in combat - are rewarded for making progress in the story, so I generally just invested my XP in tougher armour, which is a bit boring. Tech trees where you find yourself rooting around for the least uninspiring upgrade are always disappointing,",

Graphics are almost the same too, Gotham is beautiful in the snow, and the atmosphere of Christmas Eve is ♥♥♥♥ing great.

            "review_text": "Have you played the previous Arkham games? No? Then do yourself a favor and don't start with Arkham Origins.  If you played the others and liked it then you'll likely enjoy this one as well. It is inferior in many ways though, and I'll try to make a comparison of the most pertinent aspects below.  Did you enjoy the story hinted on the trailers? If so, I'm sorry to say this but you'll be disappointed. I won't spoil the surprise (even though I find it hard to believe it's a surprise to anyone by now) but there's a very obvious twist that simply negates the whole story advertised in the trailers. After the disappointment with the story passed I actually quite enjoyed it though! there are some interesting moments and characters. Nothing fantastic but it does its job competently. Considering this is a prequel they certainly made some strange decisions reagarding the story. We know the villains, we know Alfred never dies, we know Batman doesn't die etc. These things can't really be used as tension effectively, but they certainly tried. They should have used the opportunity to introduce some new characters and put some real tension in there, but that's my opinion.  But the true problem with this game is the obvious lack of polish. Bugs, glitches, freezes,crashes, performance drops... you name it, Arkham Origins has it. The lack of polish also shows on most of the gameplay features. A few examples: when in combat mode, the camera will be your worst enemy, showing the wall, hiding behind light posts, losing sight of batman or, when not being completely against you, just sitting the least helpful orientation possible with every enemy on the wrong side of the camera. Other example of lack of polish in gameplay is when gliding accross the city. You'll find yourself frustrated by the grapple's edge detection system. It has the habit of not detecting obvious edges you can see right in front of you, sometimes detecting edges you have no intention of grappling to etc. It's a less satisfying experience to say the least. These examples just illustrate the way the game was rushed to the shelves. It lacks polish, the kind of things solved by tweaking of parameters until everything feels right.  My last complaint is the zipline feature. This was one of the fun things in other games, all you needed was a wall behind and in front of you to zip accross it! Fun and a gameplay element that opens up so many possibilities. In this game they ditched that for a zip line you can attach to nodes that are put on the map by the level designer. It's so boring. It's essentially a door/key system in disguise. A very similar dumb move was made by Thief developers when ditching the freedom of rope arrows in favor of predetermined nodes where you can put your rope. It's just a fancy key to a door.  It's hard to find something they did better than previous games. I like the graphics a lot! but it's not exactly better, it's just different, more realistic style. But I do welcome the different approach, it looks very nice.  If we weren't comparing with previous Batmans (which admittedly is a difficult position for any game to be in) I would say the bugs are the main problem with it. Some of them are absolutely game breaking! but if you can endure that this is a great game. It has my recommendation.",

            "review_text": "First and foremost, this is decidedly not the first two. Don't expect an improvement on City here, save perhaps the multiplayer. That in mind, as a game on its own... It's not at all bad.   Pros:      It's a Batman game at heart: There's a story that draws you in, combat is seamless, and there's an insanely good cast of villains and side characters alike. The setting creates a good amount of immersion.    Gameplay here is great. You swing, glide, and parkour through Gotham, again making every little journey fun, and not the least bit boring. Combat's a mixed bag, with bosses not altogether unique, but each different arrangement and setting of goons you encounter make these battles the star of the game. Gadgets are improved upon, and the new electrical gloves are fun as ****.    Multiplayer. So many people knock this off, due to mechanical issues, but I easily enjoyed this part of the game more than the campaign, even. With possibly the best and most mature online community out there, a brilliant concept for battle, with three teams facing off, and a nicely balanced armory that still feels customized depending on your gang, I easily looked over the glitches and connection instability to pour 30+ hours into this mode alone.      While the sound pales in comparison to Mark Hamill and city, the music and voice acting is extremely good. You'll leave the game still feeling like Batman, the theme in your ears.   Cons:     Well, it's very glitchy. Some enemies sink into stairs, and a good deal of goons seem to be entirely blind. The brick-throwing is completely broken, but hilarious. (ran this on a 660, btw) Few of the glitches I encountered are game-breaking, but it's very jarring to be this into a game, and suddenly see five goons walking into a wall simultaneously. I spent much of the story bending over in laughter, and another good portion wrinkling my brow in frustration. The latter came mainly when gliding, due to the.. err.. flapping error. Basically, Batman has a sky seizure every three times you try to fly somewhere. This happens often in multiplayer too, and is an even bigger annoyance there, as stealth is quickly ruined by wildly flapping wings far too often.     Multiplayer has some terrible key bindings that you can't change... The same button is used for silent takedowns and vision scrambling, which blurs your victim's screen, letting them know you're right behind them. As you can guess, this is beyond frustrating, given that only a few inches determines which of these is triggered by your click.     The story and script are a little more ham-fisted than city or asylum, and there are a few groaner lines.     The map introduces fast travel... something no one asked for in these incredibly fun to traverse games, and expects the player to use them all the time. This, for me, ruined much of the open-world feel I loved in the first games.     This is a prequel, meaning chronological synchroniation with the other two is key... This is perfect in all cases save one: remember the 'prototype' grappler you get in city? Yeah, aparently, Batman had the same thing ten years earlier, and just forgot about it. Nice one, Alfred.  *finds gadget in cellar  'Oh, Master Bruce, I.. er... finished that new gadget you requested.'  'Isn't this-'  'No, no, this one's totally new, I swear.'   So, all in all, it's a fairly good game with a few design and graphical challenges. If you can't stand the issues, wait for Knight. Otherwise, grab this one, fufill your bat craving before February 2015, and look for me on multiplayer! :)",

The sandbox environment is very good and really makes you feel immersed. Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are really great games, but this one tops it all off.

Rewards are higher Enemies are smarter in away  The Bad: You might feel like your playing Arkham City all over again. Challenges can be impossible to complete.  Conclusion: Great game with a story to be told, and will keep you on your feet. If you are new to Batman, you should play Arkham Origins frist.",

I will be replaying that one next just because of this game lol.   If you are a Batman fan, there is no excuse not to pick this up! It has challenging bosses, fun stealth missions, and a story with all kinds of fun twist and turns! The game is not perfect though. I have encountered a crashing issue every so often.

This Batman is younger and more angry, and it was interesting seeing people react to him as a new figure in the city of Gotham. These things alone made the game worth playing. Even the item collecting seemed a bit more grounded, which made that more entertaining as well.  However, one is left with the sense that the game simply did not get enough playtesting, or not enough time to react to the results of playtesting. There are minor glitches here and there, but the most glaring oversight is in the combat.  Batman is no longer able to consistently interrupt his own attack animations. This most commonly manifests itself when trying to counter an attack that begins after you've already started attacking someone else. You'll find yourself getting hit a lot more. More difficulty is fine, but not allowing the player to respond to threats as they happen generally makes the combat feel unfair. This seemingly small change makes much of the gameplay less satisfying than in previous iterations, but is rendered moot about 2/3 into the game when you get a new upgrade that makes the combat fairly easy.  Batman Arkham Origins is not a bad game, but given its predecessors and its potential, it is a disappointing one.",

I played the first two Arkhams on the Xbox 360 and plugged in a 360 controller to my computer to play this game as well, so the controls for me felt very familiar. The combat is smooth and a lot better, though the better fights also mean the fights are significantly harder, but the lack of game changing elements (other than new and better gadgets) make the fights also begin to feel repetitive at times, like little things you have to do in order to get to the sweet, wonderful boss fights. However, it's not the gameplay that makes Arkham so great, but rather it's fantastic story. Every plot point ties in with eachother beautifully and, even despite this game being a pre-quel, it creates a completely fresh and new story with many unexpected moments and incredible feats of character/character development for Batman and his villains alike. The map here works better than City's, though not due to it's size, but rather it's believability. City tried too hard to make every notable building have something going on with it, whether a side mission or just snipers on the roof, while Origins leaves many buildings just building while still adding enough features on their other buildings to feel the need to travel wisely. If you enjoyed the last Arkham games then i would definately recommend this game, to the point where the story and bossfights alone are worth it.",

A bounty has been put on Batman's head for $50,000,000. That's really all I'm going to say about it -- I don't want to spoil anything.   Gameplay-wise, the game is open world (much like Arkham City). I prefer this to the linear nature of Arkham Asylum, but this game is not as polished as Arkham City/Asylum were. Certain button prompts don't always register and the first boss fight was glitchy.   Speaking of which, I really did not like the boss fights in this game. The boss fights in Asylum and City were fairly fun and unique, but all of the boss fights involve either : a) Dodge attacks, use your cape stun, and then go for a beatdown. You'll probably have to fight annoying cannon-fodder thugs too.  b) Avoid the boss and use grates/vents to sneak on them. Attack them when prompted and then go back to hiding. Then use grates/vents again and repeat until they are defeated.   Despite those complaints, I think the game has a fairly good story. I don't want to spoil anything, but there are some really great moments.   Overall, Arkham Origins is slightly weaker than Arkham City and Asylum, but still a fairly fun game.",

Now onto the gameplay, which still feels good even after three games. Some people would start getting tired, but I really do feel that this is Batman and it is the best way to play him. The gameplay overall escpecially the fighting is more refined than ever before. Although I do feel that the Predator sections are not designed as well in the past. Most of the times it feels like they are because what's a Batman game without making people scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? All in all it's a strong game and a great entry in the seires. The sidequests themselves I believe are really good although some lack the same creativity that in shown in Mad Hatter's story line. Deadshot for one is an example of it just coming up to getting a very tricky predator sequence that you have to pass to defeat him. Not as aswesome as the Wonderland you explore in Mad Hatters quest.  FOR PEOPLE: Who want more Batman! The game is great and the storyline I dare say is second only to Arkham City.

Dialogue was excellent, and I really liked watching characters bring up why Batman is not the right answer to every problem.  There's a lot more emphasis on boss fights in this entry, and some of them are cool! But some of them are quite frustrating, especially since this game seems to be a bit buggier than the two before it. This probably has something to do with the larger scale. Since the only thing to do in this larger world is fight goons, and you will assuredly find more goons.

The adventure starts with a rogue's gallery of more obscure Batman's Nemisises (Nemesisi? Nemisiss? is this even a word?) but eventually circles back to all of the same antagonists the previous games used. The story isn't bad exactly, just sort of boring.

            "review_text": "A good Arkham game. Not the best sure... But still overwhelmingly good!  The backlash at this game is surely reasonable, seeing that it's done by a new developer and as such is not a Rocksteady game. But, the backlash is unjustifiable. This game is really good and a solid addition to the Arkham series. It may not be Rocksteady, and may not be too innovative. But it does innovate and does the Batman: Arkham formula right!  The game's story is set on Christmas Eve when Black Mask decides to put a bounty on a very young Batman, who's still in his second year of crime fighting, which attracts the world's 8 deadliest assassins to track him down. The story is easily the best part about the game and is a very good Batman story. It does what other Arkham games dind't do, which is explore the dynamic between Batman and his allies, mainly Alfred, Barbara (AKA Batgirl) and Comissioner Gordon. The story is set 5 years before Asylum, but quite honestly, it should be 10. The characters are way, WAY younger than their Asylum counterparts and really, since Asylum depicts Tim Drake as being the current Robin, while Origins depicts Batman working alone. It just doesn't fit well... but that's a nitpick.  The gameplay mechanics are pretty much the same as City. Free flow combat. Stealth gameplay. Crime scene investigations. Open world gliding and grappling. Riddler trophies. It's really similar to City, but still has some twists of its own. Some new gadgets such as the Reverse Claw and the Concussion Detonator offer some cool dynamic gameplay mechanics to both Stealth and Combat. New enemy types such as the Martial Artist are also a very welcome addition that really make combat much more interesting and less repetitive.  It's easily noticeable that this isn't a Rocksteady game since the way the grappling works and the enemy AI are, really feel different... I feel like this is a nitpick, but it's just something I felt having played both other Batman games. Still, glitches and bugs were a rare occasion for me personally, yet I felt they were more than City or Asylum ever had.  Multiplayer is interesting, offering a 3v3v2 scenario. Playing as a goon in Joker and Bane's gangs is acceptable. It's a very standard 3rd person shooter. Still, the feeling of having Batman or Robin on your tail really helps you understand how the goons you beat up in singleplayer feel like. Batman and Robin themselves are the same as usual, but knowing that the goons you take out are players really change the feeling of pulling off a sucessful takedown. The assymetric aspect of the multiplayer however is its downfall. Having Batman, Robin, Joker, Bane and goons all play different is not only confusing, but also frustrating since you never seem to catch a break and play with who you want.  This is a Batman game however and what matters is the singleplayer. Thankfully Arkham Origins delivers a good Batman experience with some minor tweaks but innovations nonetheless. An amazing story and the solid gameplay from past Arkham games make it a very cool game. Just don't expect a Rocksteady game. Still, WB Montreal's first game is an amazing one for a first game.  Buy it if you want some more Batman action before Arkham Knight. It's really good but if City was just the ammount of Batman you were craving, you can skip it without missing out on too much. But, if you haven't played the others, by all means, buy this game. It's really good!  Highly recommend it.",

While it seems interesting on paper, the the studio behind this game played things as safe as they possibly could. The map is largely borrowed from Arkham City, most (if not all) of the new gadgets are just the old toys with slightly different mechanics and passed off as 'New', nothing new to batman's move set as far as combat goes, the missions feel like they were recycled from the first two games... This prequel never steps sets out to improve on the games before it. But at the same time, it's not bad. It just feels like a step back in quality a bit, and whatever new things this game adds their so minor that they really don't make much of a difference. Gamers label this game as glorified DLC for a reason.  If you had to choose, forget this title and just play the original games. The game may be titled 'Origins', but believe me when I say you're not missing anything. In a way, this game has about as much importance to the Arkham series as Harley Quinn's Revenge had to Arkham City. It's just filler.   Though, despite my complaints, I can still recommend this game. Just... not for at full price. Wait for a Batman Steam sale and scoop this up for $5.00... hell, even the season pass wouldn't hurt for the Mr. Freeze side story, challenge maps, and additional costumes. For $10.00, it's worth it, but for the asking price, you're better off buying the first two or putting that cash towards Arkham Knight.",

My initial thoughts on this game were overwhelmingly negative; I found myself uninstalling it after 8 grueling hours of stressing over when the next game breaking glitch would occur and it felt refreshing to rid myself of this game's torture. However, I attempted a new game recently just because I had a hankering for some Batman: Arkham-style combat and here I am now, having just finished the campaign without a single save-corrupting, fall-through-the-floor, get-stuck-in-a-building-glitch occuring. And, I have to say that now that I've experienced the game the way it was meant to be experienced I can say that this is a deserving entry in the Arkham series, from a creative standpoint. Strictly. From a creative standpoint. Why is it a creative standpoint you ask? Because the developers of Origin are technologically inept and couldn't program better than a monkey with a brain tumor. Okay, that might be a little too much, but seriously, let me tell you about these developers.  Warner Brothers Montreau's first game was Batman: Arkham City Armored Edition. It was a special edition Wii U version of the award winning Batman: Arkham City, and it was alright. It was essentially Arkham City with a little gloss and a dash of confetti to spice it up.  Then they made a web-based game that I don't know anything about. Then they made Batman: Arkham Origins. This game. Now get this: The developer has worked with this engine before, with the Armored Edition of Arkham City. Now they're using the same map and the same engine ONCE MORE, except this time their making an entirely new game instead of just an enhanced edition. So you'd think they'd be fairly competent with their game's techincal quality right? Nope. Nada. Nuh-uh. Sorry. Zip. Zilch. NO. The game was released with more bugs than a bug petting zoo set on a planet inhabited entirely by humanoid bug creatures. OK, they were rushed by the publisher! Big deal! Ok, sure, maybe they were 'rushed' for the release. HOWEVER, get this, in February the developers stated the following:  'The team is currently working hard on the upcoming story DLC and there currently are no plans for releasing another patch to address the issues that have been reported on the forums,' and later that the game: 'will unfortunately no longer be addressed.' They did say they would fix gamebreaking and progression stopping issues somewhere during that article, however those issues still exist, so it doesn't matter. HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA! YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PATCH YOUR GAME!? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, OH GOD I'M GOING FULL ON JOKER HERE HAHA HA HA! Another interesting thing: the game hasn't had a patch since April, if you look at the Steam news under the game. So it's true. The game is forgotten. Completely inexplicably forgotten, for no reason other than that the developers just said no. Now that this rant is over, I'll tell you why I think Arkham Origins is a good Batman game.  The following pros and cons are in the context of this game being the same game as Arkham City, which it pretty much is, but with a different story. So feel free to add any of the pros and cons for that game into here.  Pros + Combat is improved greatly; there are several new enemy types, each a joy to fight. Combat is also smoother, and the animations seem to flow better. + Graphics are better. They're not next-gen, in fact they're essentially Arkham City's graphics just enhanced with new visual effects here and there. + Story is awesome. As much as I disdain some aspects of this game, notably the developers, I applaud the plot here. It draws heavily upon Batman mythos and one of my favorite Batman graphic novels: The Killing Joke. Though I suppose the writers had nothing to do with the programming so huzzah for the writers! + The game is generally more cinematic, with superior cut scenes when compared to the previous two entries. + New voice actors for Batman and Joker were well cast and do an excellent job + Character design is awesome, Copperhead looks genuinely cool, Bane is actually treated as Bane for once (super strong, but also super smart) Deathstroke looks cool.  An interesting addition to Origins was the detective segments, which are greatly improved over the previous games' attempts. However, I'm not going to add this as a specific Pro since i believe that it's simply not significant enough, they're essentially pseudo-quicktime events that look cool but nothing more.  Cons - The game is buggy. Very. Very buggy. - The developers do not care about their customers. - The game heavily relies on rehashing content from the first two games and rarely adds anything of its own. - The open world here is empty and less interesting. It may seem like there are more things to do in Origins when compared to City, but in actuallity there isn't a lot. Collecting extortion files is boring compared to solving riddles, the side missions are boring and not as well written, the random goon voices you'll hear throughout the city are downright dreadful to listen to, they never say anything cool or funny and you'll hear the same lines OVER and OVER the entire game. I remember smirking and being genuinely interested in what the goons in Arkham City had to say. Here? Nope. Also, I hate to make this single con in an already long-winded review so long, but the opening of Arkham City was seriously cool, wheareas the opening here is very, very lackluster. Sorry, I just needed to say that.  I'm not going to add a con for this, since it wouldn't really be fair, but I always note when games have Nvidia's Physx technology. Unless you have an Nvidia graphics card or a NASA processor, you can't enable this without suffering massive FPS drops. In game there's lots of cool cloth simulation and papers/flyers flying about among other things when you have it activated. It's been said elsewhere and I'll say it here, my graphics card is capable of these things but Nvidia, being a greedy company made it to where you simply cannot efficiently use this technology on anything other than Nvidia cards. Games should be played the way the developers meant them to be played, not the way greedy companies meant them to be played (yes, Nvidia pun).  In all, I'd give Arkham Origins a 6/10. It's worth a playthrough if you liked the first games, for its story and the improvements made to combat. If you've never played an Arkham title, please go back and play Arkham Asylum or City first.  I'd rate the developers of this game a 4/10. The only reason they don't go any lower is because somewhere within that cesspool of 'gaming development' there are writers and creative directors who did a remarkable job trying to follow up an award winning series with their own take. And for that, I feel they deserve a commendation. For the rest of them? Please learn how to program before making a AAA-title, and always put technical stability above more content. How can we play the new content if we can't play the game? Oh, you hear that? I think it's the sound of 'logic'.  WARNING: Know this if you buy the game, there are still game breaking bugs present. You MAY run into them, and you MAY lose hours of progress, though some people never even experience one of them, others, like myself ran into TWO in my first 8 hours. It took three new games before I finally was able to beat the game. There are some workarounds out there for the majority of them, as well as backing up your saves.       TL;DR: The game is okay and worth it for fans of the series but the developers used mostly rehashed content, then botched the rehashed content somehow producing a truck load of bugs and now refuse to fix it and instead want to make more money with DLC.",

            "review_text": "The second Arkham game I played. Numerous glitches made this game problematic - especially for PS3 users who (much like PC users with AK) were majorly shafted with several problems that were never fully solved and remain in gameplay to this day - ranging from graphic problems with lag during glide-mode all the way to Batman becoming 'stuck' during boss fights.   The 'shock gauntlets' (for lack of a better name) while an interesting gimmick for less-capable players, took away much of the challenge that City contained and lacked any option to disable them. Like Batman himself this game was much more rough-around-the-edges than what was to come; but what it did right it did well and for that it deserves appreciation.   The story, the atmosphere and the young Bruce/Batman MADE this game approachable even if you weren't familiar with the series. It is an origin story without actually being one.   The new 'random event/cop in danger' missions that crop up from time to time over the police band are a welcome distraction that feels like it could have been used in Knight. The much larger map of Knight with randomly generated numbers of foes and victims to save would have been quite a simple feature and is one of the reasons I still play Origins.   Getting back to the story - and it isn't hard to do so - the plot in Origins moves around much more quickly than City, Asylum and Knight as well. The feel of a goal - a purpose - is much more present in Origins. Gotham - for the first time in the series history - actually FEELS like a city (or at least a town) with the much larger scope and map. Also, the origins the game gives for characters and areas that are introduced through the narrative are not only plausible, they (in many ways) are more streamlined and believable than many things DC has produced to date!   The writing of this game - coupled with actors like Troy Baker - leave you wanting more even if you get stuck during that fight with firefly.",

            "review_text": "This game is good &amp; comparable to Arkham City in many ways. In fact, a lot of assets from AC look like they were used in this game. The downside is it's not AC &amp; it's hard to say whether it's better or worse than AC in general because there are a lot of issues with this game that keep it from greatness, but it also adds a lot more to the game as well.  PROS -Large open City to Explore (roughly 3-4x larger than AC) -More Villains &amp; Boss Fights -Same great combat system -Even more gadgets &amp; upgrades  CONS -Bugs &amp; Glitches -Performance Issues (DX10 Fix Needed) -Feels Copy/Pasted from AC -WB has no intentions of fixing what's broke  FEATURES  A good example of something good this game adds is the way you unlock certain abilities by completing challenges. This may seem tedious at first &amp; in the end it actually is, but it does add a bit more depth to how you earn &amp; unlock certain gadgets. The downside is all the gadgets in this game are all just carbon copies from AC with very few new additions. The best new addition to your arsenal would be the Grapnel Hook which allows you to silently take out enemies from a distance or crowd control during combat. Another new addition is the Concussion Grenade but I found it fairly useless. It's only use is crowd controlling one target &amp; it only stuns for about a second. It's hot key is also set up in such a way that it's hard to quickfire so I never found myself using it.  There are also detective segments that are kind of interactive cut scenes where you rewind/fast forward to find clues hidden in the area. These aren't a huge addition &amp; don't really make you feel like a detective since it just feeds you everything you need to know. It would have been more interesting to have actual puzzles or something to make you feel like a detective looking for clues at a crime scene like in L.A. Noire. How is Batman the 'World's Greatest Detective' if he just lets his computer do all the work for him?  The campaign in this game is done very well &amp; is probably the only thing in this game that's better than AC. It's set up around the period where Batman first meets The Joker &amp; the main story is about Black Mask hiring all sorts of assassins to 'Kill The Bat' during Christmas Eve, with a good plot twist near the end. It's extremely well done. The voice actors are all A grade &amp; the guy playing Joker does an excellent job of imitating Mark Hamill's Joker. Honestly, you probably wouldn't know it isn't MH playing him unless you read the credits.   There is also a lot more to do in this game than in AC. Well over twice the amount of content, with a city almost 3x (maybe more?) it's size. This means more collectibles &amp; many more Riddler items you will need to collect in order to beat him. There is also a fast travel where you call your jet to pick you up &amp; drop you off. You do need to unlock towers that Riddler has locked down in order for your auto-pilot to find you &amp; you can't unlock them all right away as some require gadgets that you unlock through the story. The city is huge &amp; full of things to find &amp; there's also random 'Crimes in Progress' that happen periodically that will keep you busy well after completing the game.  There are also several more enemies &amp; boss fights in this game. The downside is that all the boss fights are full of fake difficulty. Pretty much every boss in this game (with a few exceptions) you fight along side his minion cohorts. Now the other games did this as well, but when they did it they gave you opportunities to take out many minions at once either by controlling bane or a giant mutant, but this one is set up with little to no actual devices for that. Sometimes the boss may hit a minion, but most of the time he'll focus on you &amp; when he does actually hit a minion by accident little to no damage is taken &amp; it mostly serves as a short stun effect.  GLITCHES &amp; ISSUES  This game also has several glitches that WB has no intention of ever fixing &amp; these range from minor failings to major oversights. One in particular is in the beginning of the game in the first boss battle with Killer Croc. When it triggers he will constantly flash invisible &amp; most of the sound will stop working properly.   Another glitch involves interrogating certain enemies similar to Riddler henchmen in AC, except they can't be KO'd however this KO invulnerability will sometimes bug out &amp; render the interrogates unable to interact with &amp; requires a reload of a previous save.   Another annoying glitch is the 2x enemy speed that sometimes happens in free flow focus mode. Enemies are supposed to be slower but sometimes they'll be much faster &amp; nearly impossible to counter.   There's also a glitch that happens during gliding which seems to be an animation bug where you constantly go in/out of a dive. It's not a huge issue but it should be noted.   Civilian faces are also very messed up looking with their eyebrows stretching beyond their forehead because of the forced expression that is on their faces. First time I saw this I thought it was a glitch, but nope. Every civilian seems to have high-arced eyebrows. Also, they all seem to be men for some reason. I guess WB didn't want to depict civilian women being attacked by male villains &amp; then being saved by a male hero possibly to avoid SJW propaganda backlash.  PERFORMANCE  I found myself having to use a 'fix' to put the game in DX10 mode in order to actually play this game. If you're experiencing any slowdown, long loading, or anything else you may need to do this as well. This fix is mainly for those of us running older hardware.  You'll need to find BMengine.ini in your game files, open it with notepad, CTRL+F 'AllowD3D11'.  Set 'AllowD3D11' to FALSE &amp; 'AllowD3D10' to TRUE. This usually fixes several performance issues that people experience with older/lesser graphics cards while playing the game. If you still experience problems try setting both to FALSE. This will force the game to run in DX9 mode.  The only feature the DX11 mode adds is better graphics &amp; shading so if you don't mind the graphical downgrade &amp; rather have a playable experience on an older machine this fix   OVERALL  Overall this game is good, but not as good as AC imo. It's got a lot more to offer content wise but at times it can be too difficult &amp; it's lack of polish when compared to its predecessors shows greatly. It's still highly recommendable &amp; worth playing. You may even like it more than AC as a lot of people do. For me it's great but not quite better than AC due to it's technical issues &amp; lack of polish when it comes to glitches &amp; animations. If this were a more polished game it would be better than AC, hands down.",

This is not a bad thing, as you play the game, you can see the evolution of batman from just a 'myth' to the feared legend he has always been.  Gameplay wise, the mechanics of the game have been polished completely, and are now better than ever, however, some of the boss fights, while amazing. tend to become repetitive and lack luster once you are halfway done the bosse's health bar.  The series has also recieved a graphic overhaul and looks way better than its brothers do, however, the Physx implementation is terribly done and leaves a lot of desire, as the papers and strings that use this seem to run at a whole different frame rate and look out of place. Another inclusion of physx is the 'dynamic' snow in which Batman and his enemies leave footprints/trail in the snow.  However,in some part of the game the use of Physx means you are going to take a HUGE impact in perfromance,even if you have a really beefy computer; and I don't mean just a 10-15 fps drop, no, I mean going from smooth as butter, to as jittery as Jell-O;when I reached that point of the game, I had to turn of Physx to continue playing,because leaving it on would have meant playing at around 15 fps.  Story wise, the game is marvelous, as it expands the background of the Dark Knight in almost a comic/graphic novel like fashion. There are many references/homages that comic fans will love to see being put in the game.  As an Arkham series game, I see why it might not be as well received as the other games,as it bring almost nothing new to the table.  But if you take it as a standalone Batman game, it might be the best one yet, if it makes any sense.  9/10   Computer used to run the game:  i7 4770k GTX 780 16 GB RAM etc,etc  Resolution:1080p  Maxed out game settings,had to turn of physx late in the game for reasons explained above.",

Indeed, it isn't recognised as part of the official Arkham trilogy (which was recently concluded with Knight), and was farmed out to a different developer instead of Rocksteady. The criticism centred around this cash-grab mentality, that Warner Bros. wanted to simply make money off the Arkham IP.  However, very little of this criticism was levelled at the game itself. Indeed, Origins is a fantastic game. It's definitely fair to say that Origins borrows heavily from its predecessors, and is short on original ideas. However, given how enjoyable the series' earlier titles were, it is difficult to complain at more of the same. The story is arguably better than Asylum or City, with a younger, darker Batman being exceptionally fun to play.  It's unlikely to win the series any new fans, but, if you enjoyed Asylum and City, you'll get a lot out of Arkham Origins.",

            "review_text": "I have not played the previous two games in this line, so I cannot make a relative comparison to them, but here's a comparison of Batman: Arkham Origins to all the other games I've known before:   1) It has elements of a fighting game, like Mortal Kombat, but is far more dimensional in many ways. You actually feel like you're participating as a Batman in his various cartoon or action movie incarnations due to the fighting style of the avatar and his animations and the style in which his opponents are portrayed. You take on groups of thugs constantly like a typical urban vigilante superhero, and the thugs react just like the comic books thugs should. You gain more experience for being hit less and fighting with more sophisticated combo techniques, allowing you to upgrade faster if you play smarter. The fighting learning curve is steep and most boss fights with the major supervillans will require retrys - but the game autosaves for you, so you just restart as much as you feel like, jumping right back in without having to press anything.  2) It is also similar to games like Metal Gear and Tenchu: Stealth Assassin in the ability of your game Batman avatar to sneak up on people, giving rewards for being like the bat and taking down a whole encounter without even being seen. You also get unlocks if you pull off archetypal bat-stunts like knocking a guy out from above or below, or by gliding in on your cape and kicking them.  3) The cinematics when certain objectives are achieved include the typical hanging a guy upside-down by his leg as a mode of interrogation as an example of how they keep you interested in the 'quest' of the storyline.  The storyline itself is early Batman, which I found a more appealing hook than the ideas behind the other two chapters: Arkham City, where they go all dystopia and exile crooks to a walled in area of Gotham seemed a bit jumping the shark for my taste in narrative integrity. If you like comics and get off on playing a superhero icon such as Batman, you might like this game. It's pretty true to form. WB is a bit greedy with their offers of extra content, like costumes that you have to unlock even though you pay for them. They don't tell you about the unlocking bit either, you find it out later. That part is lame, but I bought the expansion material for extra playable content.",

The game play remains the same, allowing you to play as Batman by gliding across the map with his cape and taking down enemies one by one in stealth. You can impair the enemies vision with smoke, take their weapons out of commission or maybe confuse them with your Batarang. You're not forced to take out enemies silently of course since you have the freedom to go 'loud' if you prefer that style of fighting.  Unlike the previous games, Arkham Origins is packaged with a Multiplayer mode allowing you to play against others as Batman, Robin or other villains from various gangs (that I won't name since it will spoil the main story).

The boss fights are greatly improved, with the story and voice keeping the same high quality. The gameplay has no great improvements besides a few tweaks and the Riddler side missions took a hit. But all in all, the game is fun and deserves your money. 8/10  Batman Arkham Origins, the game many have anticipated since the day Arkham City release, is in many senses a flop/masterpiece. The gameplay is somewhat stale, but the bosses are greatly improved; the story is almost on par with Arkham City (and definately better than Arkham Asylum), but it's release was buggy. Therefore, I am going to review each part of the game seperately, then give you the final score (a weighted average with more important elements have greater weights). The scores are from 1-10 with a 1 being garbage, a 5 being average, and a 10 being spectacular.  1. The Gameplay - Both the greatest strength and weakness of this new endeavor in the Arkham series is it's gameplay. While WB Games Montreal was smart in not trying to rewrite a broken system, they also did not bring much new to the table in terms of gadgets and fighting mechanics. There are some cool new gadgets like Deathstroke's remote zipline, and these are implemented fairly well into the game. Others however, such as electrocutioner's gloves make the game to easy in some aspects by allowing you to bypass the difficulty of the shielded and armor wearing enemies. The puzzles in the campaign are fun and challenging (a couple stumped me for a little bit) but the riddler side of the game has been slightly downgraded (as of this review the Burneley tower bug has been fixed so 100% is now possible). Gameplay - 7/10  2. The Boss Fights - The boss fights in Arkham Origins are easily the greatest improvement over Arkham City. With all of them being intuitive, imaginative, and creative, they are a joy to play. Most take something from an Arkham City boss and upgrade it e.g. taking the quick countering of Ra's al Ghul and then adding timing, variations, and a higher level of control for the Deathstroke fight (which is tied with the three part masterpiece of Bane's boss fight for best fight). This part is great, and I hope Rocksteady takes notes for the upcoming Arkham game they have been hinting at. The only dissapointing fight was the Electrocutioner, but it more served as comic relief than an actual flaw. Boss Fights - 10/10  3. The Story - The story of Arkham Origins has its ups and downs, but for the most part is solid. While I would have liked all eight of the Assassins to have gotten their own boss fight each, they are each implemented well in the story (with the exception of Electrocutioner). The game has its share of twists of turns that attempt to reach the glory of the now infamous ending to Arkham City (which I will not spoil, but if you have not played that game, fix that now, before you even think of playing this game. Arkham Asylum is also fun, but in my opinion is not critical to play before Origins. But you should.), but that in the end cannot due to the incredibly high bar. The story at some points feel slightly disjointed and confusing, but does wrap up quite nicely with a solid, though not incredible ending. Story - 8/10  4. Visuals - Arkham Origins has some slight improvements in the visuals, but overall not too much too offer in terms of newness. The cutscenes however, are beautiful and incredibly fun to watch, but the ingame graphics are only slightly better than Arkham City (which was as a side note, a beautiful game, don't get me wrong). Batman does move a bit smoother, but in the end it feels somewhat stale and halfhearted. Visuals - 7/10  5. New Features - This is kind of a grab bag of features that caught my attention, for better or for worse. One of the coolest things they added was an amazing new Crime Scene mode. You can recreate what happened during a crime and then look for clues based on where they were and following their trajectory. Another new feature is the Fast Travel System. I'm sure many liked this system, but for me it took away from the experiance. I love the feeling of flying around the city, looking for and stopping crime, and just feeling like an all around beast. But, since the Fast Travel is optional, there is really no fault in it, just personal preferance on whether it should be used or not. New Features - 7/10  6. Gotham City - While Gotham itself is not as big is many including myself thought it would be, it still is quite large, albeit that half of the city is a reskinned Arkham City with some new features. The other half however is as much a joy to explore as the Arkham City was in in its namesake of a game, the highlight being the ability to sneak in and take out corrupt GCPD officers in their own building. Perfect? No. Fun? Yes. Gotham City - 7.5/10  7. Online Play - Online Play is a variation of the regular team deathmatch mode with a twist. There are two teams of three henchman, either Bane's or Joker's, fighting each other, and one team of two, Batman and Robin, trying to stop them both. It's fun for a short while, and though I haven't gotten tired of it yet I have not played very much of it yet and could see one getting tired of it quickly down the road. What we really all want (Rocksteady take notes) is the ability to do a co-op campaign. But that isn't what we got and the multiplayer itself isn't bad. Just don't expect this to be the next big third person shooter. Online Play - 7/10  8. Voice Acting - Another major strength of the game is the voice acting. Many were scared to have Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy relinquishing their respecive roles as the Joker and Batman, but fear no more. Troy Baker as a younger Joker nailed it perfectly and while there are slight differences, none are bad, and I am perfectly ok with him taking up the mantle as the Joker. His pauses, his laugh, his switch from soft to screaming in an instant, it's all perfect and I loved it. Roger Craig Smith took over Batman, and while I still stick with Kevin Conroy as the best, Roger does a good job showing what a younger Batman might have sounded like, not perfect, but still admirable and enjoyable. Other characters are voiced by the same actors as those from Arkham City, such as Tara Strong as the loveable but ever annoying (in a good way) Harley Quinn. The voice acting keeps it's high quality and it is always fun to just sit on a roof and listen to some annoying crook rant about the cold or missing Christmas Dinner Voice Acting - 9/10  9. Side Missions - Side missions have always been a fun part of the Arkham series, looking around to find as many villians as you can, and this holds true, for the most part, here. All of the side missions are fun and interesting in their own way, whether it be gameplay, puzzles, wierdness (see Mad Hatter), or the conversations that go on while do them. The one exception to this rule, and one of the biggest dissapointments of the game so far has been the Riddler puzzles. These have been made much easier, and there are so many of these 'datapacks it becomes a chore. The radio towers add a little variety, but in the end the Riddler is a flop. Side Missions - 8/10  With all that said, what is the game's final score? Arkham Origins is a hard game to review, because it's hard to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with it. In the end though, it falls short of its lofty expectations without being a bad game by itself. Batman: Arkham Origins earns a 7/10 on release (due to bugs) and an 8/10 with patches, but I am going to blame the bugs on WB pushing the game out the Door and give it a Final Score of 8/10. It isn't perfect, but it is well worth your purchase, though I highly recommend picking up the first two, Arkham Asylum and Arkham City first.  Have Fun! -Daniel",

            "review_text": "So, went into B:AO having finished both B:AC &amp; B:AA, both of which I thought were pretty great. City was a masterpiece, a counterpoint of amazing design, story and combat. Origins; sadly not as much. So why am I recommending it? Well, it is really good, beautifully designed, intelligent, but you can’t help feeling that the game is pushing you down the path of one beat-em-up to the next. The scenes are amazing, but certain environments feel completely underused. The have fantastic atmosphere but the inane radio conversations with Alfred, who for some reason in the game is a master hacker, spy, and psychologist despite being 75 and a butler… none of the canon suggests otherwise.   When Arkham City came out, it was what Assassins Creed 2 did for the original AC; built on a great idea and then took it somewhere better with the sequels (mostly.) The entire Assassins Creed series has been built on the idea of pushing the environment, the story and the combat styles. Now both AC and the Batman series have a lot in common in terms of gameplay, combat options etc. So why then did WB stop inventing when there was so much opportunity? The combat is IDENTICAL to Arkham City, very few additions have been made. For the first time, you feel Batman is underpowered in combat (until you get the gloves…) but even then, you feel anaemic in hand-to-hand as you hit some street thug for the 12th time and he still gets up for more? The combo’s are still pretty cool, and the unlocks are decent too (although no clear guideline as to HOW you should develop you character or options of gameplay (Hint: upgrade ALL your physical combat abilities as quickly as possible in your first play through, you won’t be doing much else but forced button mashing for the majority of the game, right up to the end.)   Spiderman 3 -proof you don’t need to cram in every super villain in a single story. So why do we have 15+ in this game? Is it because at the last minute, everyone agreed that there wasn’t enough story without it? And the combat with all but a few is more irritating than awesome. I REALLY didn’t enjoy most of the encounters, not because of the difficulty, but they just felt forced. Randomly, the game throws in another half-dozen “heavies” mid-boss fight who basically just get in the way. You spend a few minutes swatting them off you like flies before heading back to the main guy only to realise that 1 more well timed mini-game “press Y to counter” and he/she was toast?!?   My other pet peeve in the game was the tiny combat spaces. This game is huge, wide open spaces, but you will spend most of the game in micro-combat arenas trying to put some space between yourself and the group of 17 henchmen, all WAY to close to really open up and deliver some serious combo blows. This is with the exception of the “bird” side mission run-up where you have 20+ encounters in nice, open spaces. It feels great until the final “bird” fight which is massively disappointing.  Lastly, I have to mention the utility belt and amazing no-you-can’t-attach-there-right-now grapnel gun. Good game design dictates that you create natural feeling limitations and barriers to keep players in the sandbox environment you have created. And with good reason. It would suck to suddenly end up “IDSPSPOPD-ing” off the map. (That’s a Doom reference kids, ask you dad.) But why, when you are Batman, flying through the city and jumping from tower to tower does THAT tower suddenly not let you attach to the balcony, or that one, or that one?!?! What’s going on? Was it because the buildings are too high for the render, or is it because the developers through it would give an unfair advantage in tactical environments? NEWSFLASH – Batman punches people with sniper rifles and machine guns by the handful. The odds aren’t exactly stacked in his favour… Now I admit, in some scenarios, the limitations of the environment are necessary, but when one bridge strut allows you to power-grapple and the next one drops you on your ♥♥♥, that’s poor design.   I have read a couple of other reviews of this game and agree with a lot of them. You get the feeling the studio and the game developers simply ran out of time to polish it quite right before deadline and so shipped out a slightly buggy, almost masterpiece that is aching for better treatment. A sad and experience ruining oversight. Batman: Arkham Origins is primed for some genius to mod the ever-loving sh!t out of it into something better, if WB ever lets them…  ",

            "review_text": "I love Batman games in general I am going to give my review of the game.  So first of all let’s start with the game mechanics, They are really good and super responsive I have to say that, but there are times when it feels like its requesting more commands and does extra punches or use baterangs or sometimes even change gadgets unwillingly. The controls are easy to use and very customizable indeed. You can have more than one button that executes the same control and/or ability.  Now let’s talk about the A.I thugs and villains. Thy need MAJOR bug fixes some may just keep running straight into the wall and disappear, there was one time where I lost a missions and I restarted and all the thugs I had to knockout just vanished, NOT COOL! I came here for a challenge I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and I'm finding it too easy. I would have to give the mechanics a 7/10.   Let’s talk about the music. I really like the music I mean I do. There's just one problem, the soundtrack is just too short only around about three-four hours. Then it can get really annoying and repetitive. I would suggest make a DLC soundtrack like most games do I don't care if it's from the previous Batman Arkham games, I personally think music from Arkham city would be a great addition! Until that happens I give it an 8/10.  Onto the story line. The story is absolutely MARVOLOUS! I love it, great acting, great modeling, and the music just fits right in, it really does put you into suspense and makes you want to finish the game just to experience the story. I also love the side missions, how you learn more about Enigma, Anarchy, The Penguins A.K.A Cobble pot, is just fascinating. I give it a 10/10.  The upgrade system. This is where it got really disappointing, I thought there would be a bunch more. It's too easy to level up and when I got the last few upgrades I was sad because I couldn't lvl up any higher. I think it would have been better with more customization and at least thirty+ upgrades to unlock. I give this a 6/10.  The map. I personally don't think you can get the map wrong and I mean any game shouldn't, this is where it bothers me a lot. There are some times where I am in in area and it shows me somewhere in the middle of the ocean. I have to say there are long periods of time where I have to wait while I use the Batwing for fast travel I had to wait for three minutes one time! I give this a 9/10.  Multiplayer. All I have to say is that it sucks! no one is on, you have to wait a good five minutes for a full lobby, but I do have to say the idea was good where two people are randomly selected to be Batman and/or Robin, and the rest gets to choose to be either in Joker's crew or Bane's. I give it a 4/10.  The last thing I'm going to talk about are the DLC's, there are some amazing DLC's to get for this game, they are incredible fun and entertaining adds a whole new level of gameplay. I love the challenge maps, skin packs from previous games, different characters to play as all of that. I give it a 10/10.  Overall I do think it's a good Batman game to own, but wait till it's on sale next summer because I got it with all the DLC's for 13$ even though normal price is 87$ I did the math. It's not worth all that money. I will give my overall impression the game deserves a 7/10. ",

The main and only reason I really say this is because the games story is much better paced than Arkham City.

Gameplay wise it's the same as City for the most part, even a good amount of gadgets are the same, but I still enjoyed using them and the few new ones.

            "review_text": "Warning: Spoilers Ahead  If you want to know what I think of the game without spoilers, just know that: It's a great entry point for people starting the series, and still an enjoyable romp for veterans of the series despite the overall uninspired level design and combat. The story and performance of the characters is what sells this entry, and in my opinion is a must play/watch for any Batman fan.  This game gets lots of flack, and only some of it is deserved. I agree with people who say the game itself is uninspired, borrowing practically every element of their game from Rocksteady's preceding games. I also agree that when it first released, it was a buggy mess. Thankfully most major issues are all fixed now, and I didn't run into anything game breaking (a far cry from when I played it at launch on the 360).  Now, despite Origins' lack of innovation, I still think it's well put together. The actual design of the game, which admittedly lifts much of Arkham City's design, is very well done, and despite some reviews I've seen that say they added nothing of their own, there are TONS of added easter eggs and content that reward Bat-fans. Furthermore, Origins adds one cool new thing that is original and adds a much needed kick into Arkham's aging combat system; the shock gloves. The shock gloves alleviate some of the tedium of combat that veterans of the Arkham series are likely getting a bit tired of, if only because they mastered it two games ago. It is essentially a temporary super powerup, allowing Batman to do even more damage to enemies and therefore ending fights even quicker. They are also incorporated into a few puzzles, but aren't actually that clever despite looking pretty cool.  Speaking of puzzles, one thing Origins does better than any of the other Arkham games are the crime-scene reconstructions. They have multiple steps, and are a lot of fun to figure out. Yes, it may be scifi mumbo jumbo, but it's engaging nonetheless.  Most importantly, I feel that Origin's story is overlooked completely by most critics. The story of Origins is objectively the best in the series. It isn't overly convoluted, and doesn't contain any out-of-character moments like the Titan-Joker fight in Asylum. While I truly appreciate the comic-book style storytelling in the first two games, and I certainly don't think Batman needs his origin retold ever again, the Arkham games nonetheless are not good entry points to casual Bat-fans. Despite it being common knowledge amongst many comic-readers, most gamers had no idea who Oracle was in Asylum, and the fact that there were many people online legitimately trying to figure out who Azrael was supposed to be in City only cements that most players are casual Batfans. Despite my personal appreciation of Rocksteady's willingness to jump into the deep end of Batman lore, I can't help but think that it hurts various storytelling elements and opportunities.  Origins, on the other hand, tells a concise Batman story, where motivations, plot twists, and themes all come together and really impress on a more universal level.  It should also be noted that while I don't think Roger Craig Smith did a bad job as Batman, he certainly doesn't have the range nor depth of Conroy. Troy Baker as the Joker, on the other hand, is in some ways even better than Hamil. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Hamil's Joker, but unfortunately for Hamil he was never really given an opportunity to cut loose with the character until much later in his career of voicing him, and his vocal chords at that point simply couldn't take that kind of strain. Baker is in his prime, and takes Hamil's version of the Joker (indeed, it is still Hamil's Joker, and I know Baker wouldn't deny it) to new levels of gritty realism and black humor that Hamil's Joker never got to really experience but a handful of times. It could be argued that Arkham Origins' plot is centrally about Batman and Joker's relationship's Origin. There is a brilliant section in the game that takes the classic Bruce Timm/Paul Dini story Mad Love, and somehow makes it even better by taking Joker's manipulation of Harley to another level completely. After being asked to describe fate by Harley, Joker begins rattling off his origin in typical dramatic fashion. The thing that's brilliant to me is that it's unclear if Joker even realizes that he's manipulating Harely; his romantic description of fate and everything it entails is [from the player's perspective] clearly concerning his relationship with Batman, but to Harley, it sounds like Joker is spilling out his feelings for her. This whole section plays out from a rather dramatic and abstract thought-plane from the Joker's perspective, with the player controlling Joker, maneuvering him through this surreal landscape while he describes how important fate is to him. It's all done so well, and Baker's performance really shines.  Another point that shines in the game overall are the new boss encounters. The assassins out to kill Batman are all capable, and in my opinion the real standout is the fight with a female Copperhead. While similar to the R'as fight from City, Copperhead's hard-to-read, snake-like movements make for an intense fight. Certainly, the boss fights overall in Origins are more varied than Asylum by far, and even City in my opinion, although nothing tops the Mr. Freeze fight from City.  Speaking of Mr. Freeze, the one extra DLC story mission is concerning Freeze's origins within the Arkhamverse. It starts out in Wayne Manor, and the player gets to control Bruce for a long while, which I always enjoy. It tells more or less the same story as the classic animated series tale, but modernizes it in a few key ways. For one, Batman reconstructs the fateful moment concerning Freeze's tragic origin, and this reconstruction is by far more engaging than the Animated Series original version where Batman simply sneaks into a security room and watches some easily-accessed, surprisingly well edited security tapes. Beyond that, though, there really isn't a substantial departure from the original tale, and like other elements of Origins, simply seems uninspired. It's done well enough, and it's worth playing through just to hear Marice LaMarche's performance as Mr. Freeze.  So overall, despite its uninspired gameplay and in certain cases storytelling, Arkham Origins is still quite well made, and certainly worth a playthrough for fans and non-fans of Batman alike. Just because it's uninspired doesn't mean it's bad, and now that it has been patched for a non-glitchy experience, there's no reason not to give it a play. The music is well done, if again, uninspired (it's mostly Gothic renditions of Christmas themes, since the game takes place during Christmas Eve). The voice acting is overall quite great, as well as the digital acting. The story is well put together and stands out as the most accessible and arguably well-written entry in the Arkham series. So play it if you get a chance, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

For once you are limited to grappeling to certain areas only while soaring through the skies of Gotham, and random glitchy occurences will also have you performing flips in the air, going through objects, or best of all punching someone twenty feet away as the game teleports you to the nearest enemy regardless of distance during your combos. Putting aside these imperfections, however, the storyline is progressively exciting with great twists for any fan of the lore. Surprise appearances by various personalities are also a treat, but nothing beats watching Batman's struggles as he learns to mature over the course of this game with the help of Alfred as he realizes he cannot be the sole savior of a city when its filled with villians he could never have imagined.",

The story progresses over 1 night (Like in all the other arkhams) and leaves you with plrenty to do after the main story is done. It is by far the best arkham game.  The only bad side is the graphics are not up to standard with Arkham City. It looks good but does not have the texture quality of its former tittle.  The multiplaying will keep you entertained for a good 10 hours, with fun gadgets and satisfying kills.  A great game.",

            "review_text": "This is a tricky one. It offers, from what I can tell, a larger world space but suffers from an insane amount of invisible walls. Even though some can be circumvented by going out of the way a bit. They did a good job making the city shiny though. The voice-overs aren't bad but not Kevin Conroy or Mark Hammill good. The character models are as good as the previous games though. The controls are the same, however the combat is a bit glitchy compared to the Arkham City; which, in my opinion, was the peak of this series. The gadgets can also be glitchy in some instances and the game kind of lacks the polish that Arkham Asylum or City had. And I haven't even bothered with the online mode. Not sure why developers feel the need to jam such things into single player games like this.   However, I guess Rocksteady is making a prequel to Arkham Asylum... which this game kind of is... and will most likely be of far better quality than this game is. That all being said, if you really liked the last two games and don't want to wait for the next actual, REAL Arkham game then buy this one... but I would wait until it is $15 or less. Definitely not worth the asking price or even half the release price.",

            "review_text": "On the one hand, you're going to hear a lot of things about this game being a lazy sequel and a shameless clone of Arkham City, and most of them are probably true. The city covers the same districts, uses the same gadgets and combat tactics, and even some of the same buildings that you've already seen in the last game.   On the other hand, even the worst Arkham game is still better than most other games. The freeflow combat system is back in all of its glory, except that now enemies will attack you much more frequently and with less warning. Part of me is grateful for the realism and added challenge of thugs not just idly standing around waiting for Batman to palm strike them, yet another part of me is frustrated in not possessing the same dominion in mob suppression and crowd control with carefully linked combos that made the previous game fights so enthralling. It was less about Batman trying not to have his clock cleaned, but more about keeping everybody whipped with seamless variety and finesse. Arkham Origins still does this, but you will have to work a lot harder to get it.  The predator system hasn't really changed at all, and at this point is starting to feel tiresome. There aren't really any new takedowns for Batman to use, except one related to a particular new gadget. The levels are also dull and poorly laid out, presenting very few opportunities to set well-placed traps in strategic locations. The explosive gel in particular has taken a big hit. The gel takedown apparently only works when it feels like it. Half the time the explosion will knock the guys on the ground with stars over their heads for a few seconds before they get back up, with the whole room now aware of your presence. And once you get the proximity upgrade, that stuff goes off whether you want it to or not, even if a guard casually strolls by while you are still spraying it.  Collectibles have again returned courtesy of the Riddler, or 'Enigma' as he is currently known, although his distinguished Riddler Trophies have been replaced with generic glowing green squares. These 'data packs,' which contain extortion data on some of Gotham's highest criminals, are encrypted and dispersed throughout the city and must be unlocked by solving simple gadget puzzles. He has also installed wireless network relay devices scattered at street level in plain view, which Batman must destroy by, brace yourselves,  throwing a batarang at them.  Well played, Edward.  Except Batman isn't looking to use Enigma's data to expose corruption the city -- he's actually trying to  stop Enigma  from doing so because apparently it's morally wrong when Edward does it, or that whistle-blowing on dirty cops, mobsters, and politicians will bring more harm than it alleviates. Don't ask me how, this is never explained.  This should now bring us to the game's sketchy story. Batman is in his early years, his existence just shy of a mythic folk tale. Corruption runs thicker than blood all the way through the police force, all of whom are dressed in SWAT gear and for some reason carry no side arms. Gotham City is under a lockdown on Christmas Eve due to a winter storm, but maybe it's more likely a ruse for the Gotham police to easily arrest the gangs. Or maybe the GCPD are so corrupt that they wish to collude with them uninhibited.   The setting looks to be a total reboot to the series, so if you're expecting a prequel or a prelude to the events in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, you can put those expectations to rest. You start off with most of the same gadgets and upgrades you acquired in Arkham City, despite being about 8 years in the past. Your detective vision is as state-of-the-art as ever, so much that it can run a virtual forensics software that reconstructs murder scenes based on a few scuff marks and blood stains. I did like the CSI: Gotham portions of the game as a new detective-style concept, but most of it is done by simply 'Press A to Think.'  The pre-Arkham city is somehow less alive and more packed with criminals despite not being a sanctioned inmate internment camp. At least the prison had political prisoners, helicopters, and other non combatants. In this city there are so many criminals that you can leap anywhere off a clock tower and land knuckle first on a class-A felon. Most of the enemies you will fight are either in  someone's  gang, or police officers who are so corrupt that they are, for all intents in purposes, criminals themselves and therefore fair game for Batman (although he does show them more restraint). The police fight with the same AI and weapons as their street thug counterparts. There is nobody else on the street: no innocent bystanders, no homeless people, no emergency vehicles, and no snow plows? All of this makes a once expansive and versatile game engine feel claustrophobic and narrow in scope.  The combat scenarios are fun but get very repetitive. The enemies fight you in groups no smaller than 5, and are so densely populated that you can't help but alert the NEXT group of bad guys on the other side of the fence before the fight ends. The rooftops are no safe haven either, as more gang members patrol listlessly with their assault rifles, waiting to be stealthily subdued in a full nelson under Batman's mighty armpit. Funny how the guard patrols never notice you until you land right in front of them, but two guys talking to each other on street level will spot you instantly.  Just in case you didn't have enough excuse to indiscriminitely beat people senseless, you can now respond to APBs for crimes on the street, just to give you more excuses to snap limbs. What's strange about this is sometimes the perpetrators are in fact fellow Gotham police officers. I have to say it's an inspiring display of integrity of a notoriously dirty police force to report their  own  crimes, but if there are no citizens out and about, then who's calling 911? And who do the dispatchers expect is going to respond?  The villains in the story are well represented and true to their archetypes from the comic and film universes. Bane, for example, is as tenacious and cunning as he is brutishly strong, with the former mirroring his film adaptation and the latter from the comics. The Mad Hatter makes another completely random appearance, this time taking Batman into Wonderland. It's creative and pretty, but too short and too much a novelty to count.  The Joker, however, completely stands out as the truly definitive version of himself. Standing in for Mark Hamill who retired from Arkham City, Troy Baker is a phenomenal second choice. He is a dead ringer for Hamill's joker, and most untrained ears (and even many trained ones) would not be able to tell them apart. The script and dialog are much better as well. The Joker that we saw in the previous Arkham games was essentially the reckless cartoon villain that we've seen in the animated series. While he was ostensibly dangerous in Arkham Asylum and City and had a significant body count to his name, he seemed too much of a goofball to be a criminal mastermind. The writers kept using little anecdotes to remind us that he was a psychopath and therefore capable of real harm. In Arkham Origins, the Joker lets his actions speak for themselves, and really knows how to get things done. He's meaner, more theatrical and razor-witted, and his carefree disregard for the lives of anyone including his own makes him all the more chaotic and downright frightening.  What you should take from this is a recommendation if you love the Arkham games and need your Batman fix. If you're looking for something fresh and new, wait for Rocksteady's Arkham Knight.",

The first thing I noticed was how well the game performed and how much crisper the visuals looked, which I was very happy about as Arkham City's frame rate was a touch patchy at its highest settings (I'm a PC player). However once I got out in the city I realised that the reason for the increased performance was due to just how much the visuals had been dialed back rather than any optimisation. The PhysX features are almost non-existant compared to the previous games and a lot of the detail appears to be missing. It's not a deal breaker but Arkham City had a much denser setting and still managed to perform well even if you couldn't max out the graphics settings.  The city itself doesn't seem very interesting either. Aside from random robberies there is no sign of life anywhere, the setting just seems a bit soulless. There is also a very long bridge that you will need traverse regularly (unless you fast travel) and I can only surmise that it is there to hide loading. Aside from that it looks sound enough but lacks character, the thrill of discovery and the easter eggs of the last game (although on the other hand it does feel a Tim Burton's Batman Returns at the start).  As far as gameplay it's pretty much the same deal as the last game. The fighting is still fun however I have noticed the camera now has a tendency to stick to walls and ceilings, and can get muddled when fighting mobs. This was never an issue in previous games, at least from what I remember.   The bosses so far have also been pretty mundane. [MILD EARLY GAME SPOILER] Crock is the first boss you fight and can be beat in a repetitive 'stun, punch, punch, punch, punch, QTE, dodge' manner with goons dropped in to prologue the fighting. I realise this is the first 'boss' in the game but it still could have been done better and should have for what is such an intimidating character. The next boss I thought in a pit also looked pretty intimidating so imagine my surprise when ONE solitary kick to the head ended the confrontation. Boss fights weren't Arkham City's strong point either but it should have at least been improved on.  The map system could also use some work as whilst it will tell you which area you need to go it doesn't get any more specific than that. Running around a building several times trying to find the correct entrance does not feel very 'Dark Knight'.  By contrast however the new Detective Mode is pretty awesome. It still holds your hand but being able to play out a crime scene in real time is pretty satisfying.  Admittedly most of that does sound pretty negative. I'm not saying the game is bad, it's definitely worth picking up. But it's probably the weakest entry so far and there is no reason to go out of your way to pick this up if you haven't already played Arkham City (although I suppose a lot of the faults in this game would be less visible if you bought this first).  So far its a 7/10 for me.",

This game could have been better with a little more inventiveness towards Batman's interaction with criminals. Most of them are just standing arround and not causing any problems. The only reason for Batman to be in such a beatdown mode is only because 'everyone is out to get him'. I am hopeful for future titles to incorporate more of a decision matrix, almost a live action 'choose your own adventure' would be neat. Aside from that, this game is fun romp!

            "review_text": "Batman: Arkham Origins is the unofficial third game in the series, I say unofficial because it wasn't developed by Rocksteady, who made both Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Most people view Origins in a bad light due to this fact, and there are certain points that feel strange when transitioning from City or Asylum to Origins, for one the sound seems a little off, adjusting to the new voice actor for Batman is a little strange, but you get used to him eventually, the graphics seems somewhat off, not standing up like Cities impressive visuals, however the enviroment designs are beautiful such as Gotham in snow and the hotel and other such locations. Fighting feels off as well, the usually fluid combat feels somewhat strange when the visuals tend to pop weirdly with a filter or two, however it still is the old City style combat so it fits okay within the series.  However one of my biggest problems is the lack of variety in characters to play as. Asylum had a single character to play as (Or two depending if you had Joker), which was fine, it was a great game, then City upped the Ante by having Batman, Nightwing, Robin AND Catwoman, each with their own unique fighting styles, Deathstroke, whilst an appreciated addition to a cast list borrows a lot of his moves from Arkham City Robin, which makes him feel less unique in this work, and the third character is simply a variant of Bruce Wayne, from the Initiation DLC. Going from City to origins, you will feel it lacks a lot of the polish and shine that City had, but for being developed by another developer, they did an alright job with what they could, I liked my experiences with the game and would recommend it for someone who has played the other 2 games first. Also, as a side note, the Multiplayer did feel tacked on, and the fun of it lasted a short while. Overall I'd give Batman: Arkham Origins 7/10, It lacks enough spirit and polish to push it beyond City and Asylum, Since it was built upon the foundation laid out by Asylum and City, it doesn't do enough to warrant a higher score, it feels too much the same, however the enviroments are beautifully done and Gotham is really fun to explore around, with this unique look in the usually gothic and gloomy city, it's nice to see a more festive take on the city. Still, as a stand-alone experience, it's stands alright on it's own, I wasn't bored by this, and so I'd recommend it to someone who likes Batman or the DC universe.",

Well it doesn't.  I'm giving this a positive review, and I know by doing that I'm contributing to the problem I'm moaning about of lazy and money-grabbing game development in the mainstream industry but the fact is I still bought it, I still played it and I still enjoyed it.  If you're new to this series however, don't start with this one. With this being the chronological starting point, I know it's tempting to play this one first but start at Arkham Asylum, then City and have your mind blown twice.  This is good but pointless. Batman fans only.  IMPORTANT NOTE: I have it on good faith that my criticisms with this game lie at the feet of the publisher, not with the developers at Rocksteady, who were working on Arkham Knight at the time and had little to do with this game. This is the product of a different developer and it certainly shows.",

This game could have been better with a little more inventiveness towards Batman's interaction with criminals. Most of them are just standing arround and not causing any problems. The only reason for Batman to be in such a beatdown mode is only because 'everyone is out to get him'. I am hopeful for future titles to incorporate more of a decision matrix, almost a live action 'choose your own adventure' would be neat. Aside from that, this game is fun romp!

Why can't the game remember that? Why can't I complete combos? The controls are the same but its off. Why do you have to go to a website to unlink your WBID? Why can't you do that in the game menu? Then there are the actual glitches like how you can get stuck during the climax in an infinite loop.   So I'd say at some point this will be worth buying and playing after they've fixed most of the glitches and it goes on sale again.

That being said if you are someone who is looking to jump into Arkham franchise; this is a very good choice for starting with. There have been many complaints about this game being too similar to City in regards to the combat which to be fair is pretty similar to the City with a few minor changes and they use the same assets as in City. However in story driven games such as this I don’t really mind it that much so long as it gives me an interesting and entertaining story which this game does. The best part of this game has to be the new detective mode they introduced, instead of searching for some paste on the ground you attempt to reconstruct the crime scene by piecing together clues you find and rewinding and fast forwarding the crime scene as you construct it. It’s really one of the most innovative things I’ve seen in video games in a while and really brings out the “World’s Greatest Detective” in Batman. My two biggest problems with this game are actually the way it was advertised and the multiplayer (SPOILER ALERT AHEAD). In the steam page of this game you will see batman facing off against two villains, one being the crime boss Black Mask and the other the mercenary Deathstroke. If you are fan of comic books you’ll know that Black Mask is one of Batman’s most underrated villains with a fascinating back story and Deathstroke a prominent foe of the Teen Titans who is a very formidable opponent. When they announced this game they stated that Black mask would be the main villain and the first trailer of this game featured an epic fight between Deathstroke and Batman. I was very excited that these characters were going to be shown prominently outside the comics. However, Deathstroke is only involved in one fight and is never seen in the campaign again and Black Masks back story is never touched on and you only ever actually see him in one cut scene as it is reveled in a plot twist that the Joker had been masquerading as the Black Mask for the entire game. Had I never seen the trailer or followed the build up to this game I probably wouldn’t have thought anything of it, but having been led on to expect a campaign mainly featuring Black Mask and Deathstroke, I couldn’t help feeling let down by this. Now I’m not saying that the story in the game was a bad one, far from it actually, it was just something I received that I wasn’t expecting. The multiplayer on this game has its fun moments but is ultimately a pay to win game which is just really unnecessary for a game that isn’t free to play and anytime you play as a thug and not Batman and Robin, you’re really just looking forward to the moment you can play as Joker or Bane.",

The 74 rating on Metacritic made me raise my eyebrow.  And I could quickly see why. It's not Arkham City, but it's still a good Batman Arkham game. Basically, it's AC with more stuff.  The gameplay is very, very similar, but it's not as nicely balanced as AC - the remote claw makes Predator encounters p1ss easy, and the Shock gloves make fighting a joke. I did, however, welcome the new unlock system, which put some rather powerful upgrades (like dropping the minimum combo multiplier requirement from 8x to 5x) a bit later in the game. Martial artists are a welcome addition IMO as well, adding some variety in the enemies.  The Dark Knight challenges are a great addition, and they really put you to the test as a Batman gamer - however, you are NOT forewarned that the 'Worst Nightmare' challenges can ONLY be completed during story predator rooms (though some can be done in freeroam) and once you're done with New Game, you have to go through New Game Plus if you want them all.   The Enigma trophies have been cut in half and they are easier to find, which is a great addition, I felt that in AC they were too abundant.  The story is a bit weaker than AC, but it's still enjoyable. The characters are interesting, but not as fleshed-out as in AC.  All in all, it's close to AC, but no cigar. It's still not a BAD game by any standards, and if you enjoyed AC, get AO as well, I think my 'hours played' shows that I enjoyed both about the same ;)  P.S.: I am aware that a lot of people have reported various glitches that this game is supposed to have; personally, I experienced none, but just so you know that there are some, apparently.",

With the addition of the shock gloves, armored and shield enemies are no problem. The remote claw makes take downs in predator mode happen with easy, and the multi baterang is great for group combat. The amount of available skins is ridiculous and it has way more then AC did. For the current sale price this game is definetely worth 38 bucks. I have not tried the online play yet because I am not really an online versus or PvP kind of guy. I play games for good storylines and 1 player combat that I take on at my own pace. The Initiation DLC is a nice little bonus if you get the season pass. Many people complained about it but they need to remember that the iniation dlc was only 7 dollars. For 7 dollars you get a whole new character in challenge modes which is Bruce Wayne, and Ninja Bruce Wayne. The reason I say a whole new character is because the Initiation Bruce Wayne combat style is way different then that of Batman. You get totally different gadgets and new combat takedowns. You get a challenge campaign with 5 maps with a mini storyline. So for 7 dollars it is well worth it. People if you want DLC with an advanced storyline you are gonna have to wait for the final DLC in the season pass. Remember Harley Quinn's Revenge in AC was 15 dollars so why do some think they would get the same thing with Origins for half the price. The only thing I did not like in this game was how easy it was to obtain enigma data packs. The data packs are the equivalent to Riddler Trophies in AA and AC. Some of the puzzles in AA and AC took a bit of time and thought to obtain. In AO many of them can be obtained by either blowing up a weak wall or hacking a locked door. Other then that this is a great addition to the Arkham series and I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of this series.",

We even get all the 'you can't live without me, I am your oppoiste, we aren't so diffrent you and I' Joker scenes that are a direct result of replicating Christopher Nolan's Joker. The story joins Arkham City where there's too many cooks spoiling the brough. Voice acting was pretty good. Making Copperhead a woman was a good decision, not really that big of a character in the comics and her design is pretty wizard. Also Barbara said the words 'Nice PWNbox' non ironically in a game written in 2012.   OTHER  No Catwoman. She really offered a minimal apporach to the game and you didn't get overwhelmed by all the gadgets of the Bat. She is very fun to play as in City.",

The Arkham series, heavily based on the Bruce Timm DC Universe, has been one of the best series of comic book hero games to date. With great fighting mechanics, tons of lore and back story and of course, you get to play as the God Damned Batman. What more could you want?  So where does Arkham Origins fit in with the others? In m opinion it is a solid entry into the franchis and WB Montreal did a decent job. I would give it a 8/10.  Apart from some bugs, only a few that everyone experienced, the game itself was just as good as Arkham City. It ties in with the other two and exposes you to events that start the cascade of Arkham Asylum and ultimately what happens in Arkham City. It introduces some new villians and uses some older ones while tying the story together in a neat christmas package.  The graphics are about the same as Arkham City except there were no performance issues to start.  The voice actors are great and do a good job of portraying a younger Batman and Joker, although I still prefer Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill as they have defined those two for almost 20 years.  The gameplay is as good as Arkham City, better than Arkham Asylum but the thugs are not as scared so they will react faster. This means you have to watch and react faster to counters and especially the harder enemies.  The story over all is a good story to tie in with the Arkham Universe. It shows how all the madness begins while also filling you in on more back story of the characters.  Overall, it is a good game. I found it worth the $50 dollars but I am also a big DC fan so those that are not as big of DC fans might want to get it on sale, but either way it needs to be played.",

Yes, it's a step backwards for the series, it has some serious unpatched bugs, and it's generally an unworthy followup to its two predecessors. But keep in mind that Arkham Asylum and Arkham City were legendarily good games; they left plenty of space for the sequel to be inferior without being downright bad.  Arkham Origins feels primarily like a clumsier, less polished attempt to recreate Arkham City, and I could rhyme off at length the ways in which it fails to measure up to City, but they're already well known. The critical matter is that Origins is still fun. Not as fun as City, and sometimes the glitches get irksome, but still fun. I played all the way through to end, and still liked it enough to want more.   Bottom line; if you haven't played any of the series, start with the older and better ones. But if you've fallen in love with the amazing gameplay of the series, Origins is still enjoyable. It can help tide you over until the release of Arkham Knight. And it's even a little endearing when Batman tries to swoop dramatically off a rooftop, only to have his transition-to-glide animation glitch out, causing him to flap his way down the street like a demented sparrow.",

Crime scenes more or less felt like 'LOOK FOR THE BIG RED BUTTON THATS FLASHING IN YOUR FACE!'. 2. The camera can move a little slow at times during a fight with large numbers of goons.

Now, for the long-time fans of the series, this game was a bit of a letdown, but as I said before, it's not a big surprise. Origins is essentially a copy of Arkham City, with a slightly bigger world and some altered mechanics. The boss fights were reduced to combinations of punching and countering, and were basically upgraded thugs. The Most Wanted system for side missions took all of the mystery and continuous searching out of the game, and basically handed you a location and a group of enemies. Now, for the first-time player of the Arkham series, the game is great. It's well optimized, it has great graphics, and an okay story. Now, story. The most important part of a Batman game. WB Games decided yet again to make the main villain someone who, (without giving spoilers) has appeared in all previous games, and is getting a little stale. It's understandable, because WB Games was trying to more continue the series, rather than innovate it. All in all, Arkham Origins is okay, but I would highly reccomend Arkham City, as the boss fights and side missions are much better. I would rate Batman: Arkham Origins a 6/10.",

What compels me to write a review is that there are so many glitches. I get that PC games are more prone to glitches than consoles but this ate my patience away like a mofo. I was not happy in that regard. That was the most disappointing aspect of this game. There are other mild 'meh' issues such as the Arkham City-based mechanics, lack of Conroy and Hamill (still props to Smith and Baker), and unchallenging, easy-to-put-to-sleep enemy henchmen. In addition, I came with the notion, per game trailers, that Black Mask would be the main villain; I was heavily disappointed that he was not.   This is the weakest of all the Arkham games.   But, I must say, I appreciate the storyline, the genesis of Batman, again I'm all about 'datplot', and it was a villain feast to fight mano a mano (a very fair introduction to the less heard villains of the Batman universe), and of course, there were definitely some good lines that touches the pathos.   So, if you have the patience of a saint for 'em glitches (which I don't have) and an affinity to Batman and everything Batman (which I have tremendous amount of), this a good addition to your gaming arsenal.   Tip for the plebeian: Just get it when it's on sale.",

Counters put the tinest bit more empahasis on timing now with Critical Counters and bossfights). And thats only in the first 30% of the game.   My advice, pick it up on a sale.

I really liked Batman Arkham Origins. It took me 16+ hours to beat. I only experienced 2 glitch. One of them happened when near the end of the game when your in the prison block, when fighting the 20+ guys the giant brute got stuck when trying to get out of his cell the cell door close on him because the guys were blocking it and he fused in with the door. [This happened to me in other Batman games also. The other glitch is when I defeated Bane the 2nd time before the TN1 venom was I defeated him and died at the same time so the cutscene audio played. One common 'glitch' [more so a collision/speed error thing] is sometimes when you slam a guy into the ground he'll fly into the sky and sometimes never come back down or he'll fly up a staircase and back down.   I would rate this 9.5/10 A good game, I reccomend this for any Batman fan even though its not canon. [Well thats what some people say]  Some of these are more so my opinion then actual pros or cons.  Cons: - Not as of a good story compared to the others [in my opinion] - Bane TN1 spining after slamming him into a wall some times [doesn't last long, but kind of annoying when it goes past the 10 min mark of the time you have to take him down] -Not a big fan of Joker's voice actor [Opinion] -Could of explained the change of Joker between Origins and Arkham Asylum [Opinion] -30+ minutes of non skipable credits at the end [I think it was a glitch that it didn't let me skip it] -ignore the credits after all the talking about 9 minutes in of the credits, nothing interesting after intill after credits  Pros: -Cool gadgets -Good use of the variety of gadgets per 'level' -Good connection at the end of what happens to Joker and Arkham Asylum -Good Graphics -Cool that you have the threat of the Police and Thugs -Gliding isn't as smooth as Arkham City even though the engine is almost a carbon copy of it.

Restarting a mission or the game usually solved any issue I had.

It's challenging, it provides some background story telling and it's action packed. It has some of the best boss fights and I would consider this one a classic and I have had and will have fun playing it.",

            "review_text": "If you have played City, and thought to yourself 'That was really great, but I wish the story was a bit more interesting', then this is the game for you!  It is pretty much City, but re-skinned, and a bit buggy. Bugs, you say? How can they just re-skin and end up with bugs? Well they did. Not too many, but still annoying. I have played 33 Hours when I wrote this, and I have had enemies half clip into terrain and get stuck about six times. Luckily I have been able to knock them down to bring them back out of it each time, but that is still pretty weak work. I have also had trouble with the odd interrogation not triggering at the end of a fight too. Ground takedowns seem easy to miss as well.  Anyway, bugs aside, the game is pretty much the same as City. Fighting and Stealthing are pretty much the same, with a couple of different gadgets in the mix. You go around collecting 'Enigma Data Packs' (Villians don't have their monikers yet), solving pretty much the same puzzles as in City. You have a series of scattered objects you have to destroy. The Hatter messes with your mind.  The crime scene stuff looks pretty cool, but really boils down to, find a red triangle and hold down spacebar. Find the next red triangle and hold down spacebar. Repeat until no further triangles are evident. You get a hologram of the crime that you can move forward and back in (to find the next triangle) but it is not much of a minigame.  I had hoped that, being set several years earlier we would see a difference in tech level, but no. Everyone has touch screen smart phones, Batman has the same cryptographic sequencer, and so on. I think they missed an opportunity to look at the speed of progress of technology there, but oh well.  The other annoying thing they have done in this game is make the skill system into a kind of tree. So you can't just get the upgrades that you want, you have to follow a sequence. Or you may have to complete a particular side quest to unlock a move. I finished the story without unlocking disarm and destroy, which was pretty annoying. I did not study the tree to see who I had to defeat to get it, so just kept on wondering when I would it would pop up.  Oh yeah, one other gripe, Batman is just a little bit cross-eyed. He glances around weirdly during cut scenes and it is just a bit off putting.  I liked seeing some different villains in the game, even if one was hilariously ineffective (one hit defeat on hard. I thought it may have been a glitch, but the same thing happened on New Game+ hard too.) and most of the boss battles were interesting and different enough to be fun.  Now, the point of difference: Multi Player. I have only played a couple of hours of this, but it seemed pretty cool. It is an eight player, three faction game, with Batman and Robin on one side, three Joker thugs, and three Bane thugs. There are two game modes, but I only tried one. The two thug gangs battle it out for control of objectives and the heroes just run around griefing the others. If the heroes take out enough thugs without getting killed too much themselves, they win. If a thug gang take all three(?) objectives then they win. The Joker and Bane turn up late in the round to be taken over by whover opens the door for them. I did not do that in the time I played, figuring their buffs could be used better by a more experienced mulit-player. I found the game play pretty fun, either as thugs or heroes. The lobby system seemed pretty clunky, and the requirement for eight players exactly seemed a bit limiting. I was quite often sitting there wondering why the game was not starting, and not seeing what I could do about it.  So after reading that you may be wondering 'why the thumbs up?'. While disappointing in a few ways, all of the other Arkham games have been so great, this one only fails by comparison. If this was the first one I had played, I would love it.  ",

The plot is far better than in any prior Arkham game, the dialogue is better, and the characters are very good. The voice acting is competitive with the Conrad\\Hamel team we all know so well.  But, most importantly, at no point in playing this game did I start scraming at Batman during a cutscene. The biggest problem with Arkham Asylum and Arkham City is simply that the Batman of the cutscenes is significantly more stupid\\less intelligent than the Batman you have to be to beat the games. In Arkham Origins, the Batman you have to be to beat the game is about as smart as the one in the cutscenes, and for this, it made me feel like I was Batman more than any other Arkham game.  There are tech issues, yes. And I never got the game to run as well as I thought it should. BUT forgive games like 'Fallout 3' for these issues because the content is worth it, and the content of this game more than balances out the flaws in the code.  This is a prequel worthy of being a prequel that avoids all the other famous mistakes over prequels in the past. If you love Batman, you have to get it...but if you can't ignore points where characters get stuck in walls or just run against them blindly, or one or two serious level design flaws that stand out just because the rest of the level design is consummate, you might want to pass.",

If you have both fixes going and that does not work, good luck because that's all the help I can give.

Likes:   -Roger Craig Smith - Couldn't choose betwen him and Kevin Conroy as my favourite Batman voice, both are supremely suited to this character and give fantastic performances. -Troy Baker - Another fantastic performance as the Joker, likewise I would never like to have to choose between him and Mark Hamill for this role, they are both so good. -Combat, I am a big fan of this freeflow style fighting, very satisfying to hear the thuds and cracks.(once you resist the urge to mash the strike button :)) -One game I am happy to re-play. -Some fights you could put straight into a film or cartoon. -All the voice acting is amazing,  -The characters are how they should be in the Batman franchise, very dark in some cases. -The Atmosphere, always something going on or being said. -The price it's at on steam now is a steal for what you get. - The controls are extremely minimal while at the same time giving you the impression that you are doing alot.  Dislikes:  -The usual dribble from games/hardware developers when you start the game that can't be skipped. Fair enough the first time you start the game but not every time as if we've forgotten. If you want to advertise put your logos on in game billboards or something. -Would be nice to have some variation on the skill tree so you had to make choices. - Having to Navigate through entire empty levels to exit most buildings. Could do with a 'return to entrance' button or an exit at or near the last encounter(only available once the 'boss' is dealt with or mission is complete). There probably is a work around like relogging or such but nothing immediately obvious...at least not for me. - Rite of Passage Challenge map, this is a great challenge, it's a shame its hidden in sub menus, I don't think everyone finishes all the challenges once the story is finished so potentially alot of people are missing out by not realising.  Favourite Moments.  -Deathstroke fight. For me this was such a good fight just to watch, even more so to take part in. -Bane at full strength. If you want suspense then this is the boss for you, being chased by him is scary lol.",

The gameplay is still well done, but I think some of the new gadgets make it a bit too easy (e.g. the shock gloves, the remote claw). The story for me was kinda disappointing, mainly because of the fact that (spoiler alert, although it's all on the posters) the game relies on the Joker AGAIN, despite having a great premise; 8 assassins that are after Batman for a bounty put on him by Black Mask. Once the Joker is in, all the assassins are completely forgetten about, and it just turns into another 'Batman vs Joker' story, which works, but is something we've seen loads of times already, expecially in the Arkham series. I also felt the story lacked focus. The game looks great, but I came across a lot of bugs and glitches. I mean the first two weren't exactly completely glitch free, but it wasn't very common, whereas in this one, I come across lots every time I play. This isn't a nitpick: while it doesn't really ruin the experience, it can be really annoying sometimes. I heard there's a common bug (I haven't got it, so I guess I was lucky) that actually prevents you from completing one of the Enigma side missions- now that's not good. Another thing is while this game is packed with loads of great content, a lot of it feels too similar to what we saw in Arkham City. I'd say that there are two areas where this game improves over its predeccesors; one being its boss fights, and the other being the crime scene investigations. Overall, I'd say if you're new to the series, definitely play the others first. If you're a fan of the series, like me, and you just want more of the excellent combat and predator takedown stages, then this is worth checking out. Just be aware of the glitches, as they can be a serious problem sometimes, but I still think you'll have a good time with this. 7/10",

If they tried to change it would've been probably bad, I don't think you can upgrade this kind of combat much since it's already so good. The story is better than in Arkham City. Graphics are great, voice acting as always good. For me it was a 9/10 game.

        {
            "review_text": "TL;DR:  JUST SHUT UP AND FEED YOUR MONEY INTO THE DISC DRIVE UNTIL THE GAME STARTS DOWNLOADING. No, in all seriousness... The game is good. Much of the actual gameplay is the same as what you find in Arkham City, but the story at least makes it worth playing, especially if you're new to the series. It's also a pretty decent PC port. It runs well, and the keyboard and mouse work well too, but some menus are lacking full mouse support. I'd recommend a controller if you have access to one, but it's probably not worth running out and buying one for it. In conclusion, I'd recommend buying it, whether you're new to the Arkham series or a long-time fan--But if you're new, do yourself a favour and go  pick up the other games after you beat this one.     Dear god where to begin...  In terms of gameplay the game feels literally just like Arkham City. Everything you knew and loved is there(though many of it goes by different names, and there have been several improvements), from the line-launcher to the freeze grenades, hell, even the grapnel boost makes a return--though it's worth mentioning that unlike City, almost all of your gadgets except the batarang and the bat claw must be unlocked through the story.  This is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, returning players will feel right at home with Origins, but on the other, returning players expecting a new experience will be left wanting. Having entirely completed Arkham City on console in the past, I can tell you that I DEFINITELY didn't enjoy Arkham Origins for its combat, or its puzzles. The addition of skills that do things like double your damage for perfectly time your blows, the addtion of the shock gauntlets, and forcing you to unlock basically all of your takedown moves and gadgets as you go along made combat marginally more interesting, but the change is superficial at best. At the end of the day, you're basically the same old Bat by the half-way mark, and considering how much combat is in the game, that's less than ideal for me.  But that doesn't by any means make Origins a bad game. The addition of more casefiles to solve, the intense bossfights with the assassins, and the AMAZING storyline make it totally worth playing. The casefiles are usually a lot shorter and simpler than they were in City, with each one usually lasting 5 to 10 minutes max, not counting the trek from point A to point B to collect the perpetraitor. All the casefiles I've seen so far sans one have been a murder, but the one that wasn't turned into one almost immediately. They're fun as hell though, and there are lots of ways to kill people, so it hasn't run dry for me yet. Outside of those more mundane every-day crimes, you do see the return of several of your favourite arch-enemies from City, such as the Mad Hatter. I don't think anyone will disagree with me when I say that outside of the story, the bossfights are one of the biggest reasons to play this game. They're challenging, fun, and just satisfying as all hell. There's a ridiculous amount of variety in them, more than you'd expect considering what they are, and each boss has to be tackled in an entirely different way. Deadshot becomes a predator challenge, Deathstroke is a 1v1 duel, and Copperhead... Well, I don't want to give too much away, but Copperhead is probably one of my new favourite bosses in any game. Getting back ONTO the story though, that's probably THE number one reason to play this game. It's just fantastic. It's totally unique, and has a twist half-way through that I never saw coming. So far no two missions have been remotely similar, and I can't find a single thing to complain about.  One thing I feel like I should mention as I close down this wall of text is the lack of Hamill and Conroy in their usual roles in the Arkham series. As anyone who was following the series will know, Warner Bros Montreal didn't even approach the two stars for the roles of Joker and Batman, because they wanted the characters to sound much younger in the game. And all I have to say is.... Mission bloody well accomplished. I'll be honest, there have legitimately been times where I HAVE FORGOTTEN that I wasn't listening to Conroy and Hamill in this game. Troy Baker and Roger Smith sound ridiculously similar to young Conroy and Hamill--And I mean RIDICULOUSLY similar. Frankly, I'm envious of the impressions. They even nail the smallest mannerisms--well, most of the time. Every now and then things start to sound a little off, but it's usually pretty hard to notice once you really get into the story.  In conclusion, it's a good game. I wouldn't say it's great, but it's worth owning, and it's a worthy addition to the Arkham series. In terms of the quality of the port, there isn't much to say. The game runs fine, and for the most part keyboard &amp; mouse works well, but a controller wouldn't be a bad idea. There are a few occasions where the buttons feel awkward, and a few menus where the mouse doesn't work, but it's tollerable. Just make sure you rebind those damn quicklaunch keys. :P",

Too much of the same in a lot of cases. Did you like that quest where Bane sent you to blow up 6 containers? GOOD NEWS! We have 3 of those now! Did you like unlocking things with your bat-digital-unlocker thing? GOOD NEWS! We make you pull that thing out every 100 feet.   The story feels lost. It's broken up into how you attack each boss. However none of the storylines really go anywhere, and are not long enough to get into a character and their modivations beyond 'Somebody promised me money to kill the bat.' Batman clearly has a history with a lot of the people he encounters. He calles deathstroke by his name, but no attempt is made to explain how they know each other. However, Joker's storyline may be the best of the series, and it is easily the best part about this game.   And yes, that includes the combat. The wonderful combat that has been so balanced, and for how simple it was, took so much time to master. The flow of combat comes back. And is wonderful, and feels great....... Right up until you get the 'Shock Gloves' which then allows you to plow though every type of baddy that isn't tripple your size. Which ruins the flow of combat by turning it into a game of whack a mole.   If you were a fan of the games, then get this. Odds are you all ready have. If you are new to the series, then I would strongly suggest getting the previous games first. You'll have a better experience over all.",

It took the same idea and gameplay from City, that unfortunately worked only there. Same animations, felt like the graphics were even worse, and same sounds. The biggest mistake of the game is liveless city, which might be bigger, but you can only do so little in it! I completely lost my interest in solving the riddles challenges. In previous games, it was fun. You eventually discovered the hole game! Now here every building looks the same and repetitive.  The multiplayer for me could work perfectly, but for me they ruined it by adding progressive system, STUPID xray on thugs and very difficult movement of thugs.   For all its floss (I probably typed that wrong), the game is still great. The soundtrack is top notch and the voice acting is very well done. Allthough Mark Hammil with the original Batman is gone, I still enjoyed them, I really felt like early years of Batman.  Conclusion: If you played previous Arkham tittles, you gonna be slightly dissapointed, but satisfied (I know, my English is hillarious), however if you never played them before, you gonna love this game to its bones.",

When struck, although I did find myself having difficulty getting my rhythm back in previous titles, it is far more challenging in this one, as the combatants will continue to strike, without the option to counter this blows as batman recovers, as this was not the case in Arkham City or Arkham Asylum.   I would recomend this game for those that would like to continue the Batman story, but not for those that are new to the franchise.

Some people may like that, but I liked looking at a Riddler trophy in the first two games and thinking to my self 'How the ♥♥♥♥ do I get that?'  Mark Hamill is no longer The Joker, but Troy Baker does a really good job taking over and really flexes his versatility as a voice actor. Props to him. New voice for Batman too, but to be honest I didn't see a huge difference. Kevin Conroy has a deeper voice than this guy, that's about it.  Overall, fun game. It's worth the thirty bucks. 8.5/10",

Constant pauses to check the map will be needed. Buggier then a bug bugging out in a dune buggy. Multiplayer is dead. You're lucky to find a server with people on it. Multiplayer is nothing special. Just TDM with Batman and Robin dragged into it. Brutal on low-spec systems (Or even my mid-spec) Boss battles are repetitive  Over all, its a mixed bag. I give it a 6/10, slightly above average.

There are ledges you can't seem to climb. Batman bugs out sometimes while gliding. I've fallen through floors that were clearly there because they 'didn't load'...  Other than that, it's not as good as the other two Arkham games. There are a lot of villains in this game but not as many familiar faces except the usuals like Joker, Black Mask, Bane, Riddler and Penguin. Lots of stuff to do, but it all feels like busy work with everything getting a map marker instead of discovering things like in City. The combat isn't even as good as before. I find myself trying to avoid fighting the numerous roaming bad guys rather than taking them on...  The Multiplayer is an interesting idea, but the execution is meh in my opinion, not to mention the progress save bug that erases your multiplayer progress. It is creepy knowing that batman or robin can pop out anywhere and take you down which is very cool...  The game is still good, but it's not great. Wait until they fix the bugs before you buy it because they will annoy you a lot...  If Arkham Asylum and Arkham City were fine pieces of art then Origins is a fuzzy reproduction...",

            "review_text": "Here's My Say: Batman Arkham Origins  I thought that this game at the very start felt exactly like the previous games in the series. It started off nicely, I was slowly getting into it while being slightly disappointed with the lack of new 'features' in the game. However... The more I played it the more addicted I became to it, I started enjoying it a lot more when I had time for a nice long session of around 2-3 hours (that for me.. is a long session, funny right? I'm a busy guy) so when I had time I had a great time playing it, I then realised it was more of what the Arkham games are which is by no means bad, but the game in general does indeed fail to bring anything strikingly new to the table in terms of gameplay mechanics and also the world itself just feels.. very empty. Too empty in-fact. Especially at the start when you are free to roam around Gotham City.  The game does look pretty though! There's some great PhysX details in this one which is always great to see which Nvidia users will appreciate, the paper on the ground doesn't move around as much as it did in Arkham Asylum which is a little odd, it's a bit more still even though it is interactive, heck I'm being way too picky now.   A friend of mine, Dan mentioned something to me about the combat in the game.. which made me think.. In Arkham Origins the combat doesn't feel as.. tight? as it did in the previous games, I found myself getting hit a lot more losing my streak bonus multiplier. Dan pitched the idea that it may be a purposely implemented disadvantage for Batman and the player because he is younger and less experienced as a vigilante which makes perfect sense... but then I couldn't help but also consider that it was just generally not as polished as Rocksteady's titles. Either way, it feels like an Arkham game, looks like an Arkham game and I haven't mentioned the story yet.. but it is very impressive. There's a HUGE twist that completely throws you off though but apart from that, that's all I'll say.

The streets are populated with groups of goons here and there with no other people. The excuse for this is that there's a storm and people are being told to stay inside, but it's kind of weak. The story is alright. Nothing special. The combat is great as usual. I felt it was less responsive than the other games, but that might just be me.

It recycles various elements of the previous game, and even the game before it, pretty much turning Arkham Origins into a retread of all the Arkham games. But that's the thing. More of the same, in this case, is a good thing. It might not be innovative and it might not bring anything new to the 'Bat Table', but it certainly gives us more of the awesome open world Batman gaming that we've grown to love!

The younger Batman is far more brutal and angry in this and is portrayed well by Roger Craig Smith.   I'm not sure why this game got such a bad wrap. I think a lot of the hate has come from pretentious fans who haven't played the game because they automatically dislike it because it was made by a different team to the other Arkham games.

            "review_text": "As you can see from my profile pic I am the Batman, so naturally I recommend this game. However, if you want to make your own judgement, consider the following:  Bugs I have found 1. Batman becomes indestructible, crashing through the game map and falling into eternity. 2. Batman somehow falls off the Pioneer Bridge and triggers the firefly boss fight. He eventually works his way back, but the grapnel point is gone and all he can do is watch bad guys march back and forth through invisible walls, as Firefly calls for them to leave a piece of the bat for him. 3. Batman swoops into the Royal Hotel entrance, pleased that no villains stand between him and the Joker. As he lands eight SWAT members poof into being and shoot him dead. 4. Batman believes himself to be done with a predator encounter and can't understand why the encounter doesn't end--until he finds five villains crowded at the base of a ladder, pushing each other in an attempt to climb the ladder. Only one of them succeeds, and only after Batman silently takes down the other four. 5. During the opening Killer Croc fight, KC continuously flickers in and out of view so at one point Batman is writhing about in the snow, trying to escape from having his face bitten off by nothing. 6. Not really a glitch, but it is very amusing how the shock gloves make already-unconscious enemies fly in the air, so in the background of a finishing takedown you can see a passed-out guy sailing through the air and crashing into a dumpster. 8. Not one but two Enigma informers fail to file the necessary paperwork to have his interrogate cue renewed, so that Batman is forced to leave the pair of them cowering and pleading not to be pummelled as he goes to hunt for collectables on his own. 9. On that note, an informer who runs up to Batman, punches him in the head, then throws up his hands and surrenders with no other interaction. 10. Fast travel that is in fact not very fast, and sometimes breaks entirely, leaving Batman to fly endlessly onward into the snow. 11. After completely story mode I visited My Alibi. Upon entering the back room, all wall and floor models dropped out, and now Batman is doomed to fall forever through a sea of black with a pile of floating bad guys and two guys crouching and flinching in mid-air.  But 1. You can actually fight Killer Croc this time, rather than bonk him in the head with a Bat-gadget every few yards or sprint away from him like some kind of Bat-gazelle. 2. There are finally different types of random rescues to do (rather than one guy always intimidating one guy, which is basically an excuse to do a silent takedown every half hour). 3. There is Alfred the Butler. 4. Although this game is woefully lacking in Mark Hamills and Kevin Conroys, the two replacement actors are serviceable. 5. The last boss 'fight' is extremely cathartic. 6. Periodic Batman TAS references for us millenial kiddies. 7. A female character who fights without constantly flirting with Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction? Count me in! 8. French Canadian Christmas carolers. 9. Quickly, Chief O'Hara, to the Bat-phone! 10. For others like me who cut their teeth on stop-motion cartoons, Alfred Pennyworth is played by Martin Jarvis, aka the guy who did all the voices in Huxley Pig. For some reason I find this unbearable adorable.  Basically a game for people who love the Batman world enough to overlook more bugs than an entomology convention at Firefly's house.",

            "review_text": "After beating the main game, all the challenge packs, all of the DLC, nad the entire Most Wanted (including those annoying Datapacks), I must say, this game is very good.  Batman: Arkham Origins is set five years before Batman: Arkham Asylum, and features a new voice of Batman (Roger Craig Smith) that sounds younger. Smith does a very good job, and actually does sound like a young Kevin Conroy. Smith also voiced Ezio Auditore in Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood, and Revelations, Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell: Blacklist, and Kyle Crane in Dying Light.   Moving on, the plot is actually pretty good. Note that this is not the origins of Batman, but of many Batman villians, and strangely, of Arkham Asylum itself. Black Mask has hired assassins to kill Batman on Chirstmas Eve for $50,000,000, and Batman must fight them while learning the truth about what is going on. This introduces the best bossfights in the entire Arkham series. The Deathstroke fight is Batman VS Deathstroke, none of his men, just you two. You have to fight agaisnt an 'army' of Copperheads, use Predator skills to take down Deadshot, and Bane. The Bane fights in this game make him look weak in Arkham Asylum.  The DLC is also very good. This game had great skins, only surpassed by Arkham Knight. The Initiation DLC shows you Bruce Wayne's training in North Korea, as well as introducing another fight against Shiva, this one doing alot better. The Cold, Cold Heart DLC is one of my favorite DLC ever. Set a week after the main game, it features the origins of Mr. Freeze. The Deathstroke Pack allows you to play as Deathstroke in challenge maps, and the Black Mask Pack adds some new ones.   Pros: Almost all of the bossfights DLC Roger Craig Smith Gameplay mechanics A nice 'origin' story  Cons: Enigma's Most Wanted mission (it's as anoying as the Riddler one in City, but this time with no missions) The non-DLC Shiva fight Not enough Deathsroke. He is only in ONE FIGHT, that is all. The trailers hyped him WAAAY to much Way to much happens in the five year gap. Three Robin's, Batgirl, Batgirl getting paralyzed, and several villian origins. Akrham comics try to fill in the gap, but leave out too much.   Overall, I reccomend players play this game.",

Solid but unspectacular. If you haven't played a game in the series I would definitely recommend the first two over this.",

Arkham Origins might not be quite as good as Arkham City or Asylum, but is great nontheless.   If you stick to main story, ignoring collectibles and most of trite side missions, you'll find that it has fantastic pacing and you won't be able to quit untill every menacing thug is beaten into submission. And beating them is a joy. With wide array of gadgets and combo moves to experiment with fighting never gets stale and can be nicely challenging.   My main gripes are the controls. When you are in open world they work just fine. It's the more directed sections that become a slight problem. When you lose control over the camera, directional keys are not relative to scenery, so using a keyboard instead of analogue controller can be bothersome. There is also annoying bug that makes Batman's cape go crazy while gliding, but is rare enough that it does't brake the game.   Overall, if you like action adventure games and you're not alergic to bats, this game is easy to recommend. Go, be 'a batman'! Try to befriend Gordon and slap Joker in the face - many times over.

There are a few notable graphis glitches but nothing that makes it unplayable.  The story was actually very good. It was a nice change of pace compared to the other Arkham games. The DLC story featuring Mr. Freeze was actually the highlight of the entire series for me. I missed some of the notable voice talent and the animations and environment interactions were notably lower in quality but did not ruin the experience.  Play wise they had some fun new combat skills and some new gadgets but it did not feel out of place. The fight dynamics suffered a little on the visuals over it's predecessors but only minimally. The boss fights were actually some of the funnest in the series...even better than any of it's predecessors AND successors. The online aspect was solid if limited. Due to the age of the game and declining interest it is currently pretty hard to get a team together for some of the missions. If you can though it makes for a fantastic multiplayer diversion from the main game.  I think it is a definite buy if you like the series and a must if you find it on sale.",

            "review_text": "When developing a prequel, make sure the game doesn't take place before the QA team has tested it. The developers of Batman: AO apparently had one goal: If it isn't broken, fiddle with it until it is. They took Batman: AC, and managed to break every single aspect of the game in some way or another. The bugs are innumerable and the developers publicly stated that they would not be fixing any so they would have more time to work on the DLC. Seriously?  Where to start...Batman occasionally glitches out while gliding in the air like he's bouncing off a platform and actually gains elevation while doing so. I've gotten stuck on ledges, in objects, and been teleported to my destination when stuck while grappling. Enemies will sometimes teleport to their fallen companions after being alerted in stealth rooms. The graphics somehow received a significant downgrade despite including additional eye candy that AC doesn't have along with facial animations from 15 years ago. It also includes new performance problems that cause the game to stutter badly when flying around the city and in certain rooms indoors. Side quests regularly break with fights getting stalled or being unable to continue mission steps in the city. Combat timing feels off with counters being harder to pull off than they should be, and a couple times I had enemies attack me from so far away that even though I had a counter indicator, Batman would ready a gadget rather than countering. This is made worse by the game wildly varying the timescale during combat. I've read about some major progression-blocking bugs as well but luckily I never ran into any.  Then come the design problems. The map has no mouse support and the keyboard moves the cursor in very large increments making it very difficult to select specific locations (I know this won't affect many players but it's inexcusable for the map to be that hard to use with kb/m.) The game has a lengthy tutorial laboriously explaining the basics but afterwards assumes you have already played the previous games and does not explain anything until after you've failed the first time. The game includes way too many cutscenes and at several points in the game will drop you back into the game only to have you press one button before starting another cutscene. Most of the bossfights are long and tedious and a few rather frustrating - none feel well-designed. During one fight, after one of the frequent in-game cutscenes the boss recovered and hit me before the game gave me control back. Riddler has been copy-pasted into the game as Enigma except with less personality and extremely simplistic puzzles. The game includes less interesting characters overall and half the story feels like a rehash of AC. The new challenge system is strictly linear and will only let you attempt one at a time and most can only be completed in story missions which makes it extremely difficult to complete in one playthrough. Many ledges are ungrappleable for no reason other than to artificially make it more difficult to reach that location. Oh, and it seems Batman hasn't learned how to punch through plywood yet despite having more gear than AC and acting like The Hulk the whole game.  The only good thing I found in the game is that you unlock certain gadgets and abilities through side missions, rather than all through the story. The new martial arts master enemies are pretty interesting as well, though they can make fights a bit unpredictable due to the variable way they react to attacks and counters.  So in summary, they took AC, made every part of the game worse, added a big pile of bugs, and released AO. Play AA and AC instead or wait for AK. Save your sanity, I already lost mine.",

            "review_text": "Arkham Origins is an addicting game, but that doesn't mean it's good. As someone who has put over a hundred hours into Arkham City and has 100% Arkham City and Asylum, I'm not afraid to say that Arkham Origins is an inferior follow-up. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun; the combat is better than ever with the addition of new enemy types and the ability to stack up to 2 special moves. But besides that there isn't really that much the game has going for it. The predator rooms feel uninspered and generic compared to the ones in City, and can be breezed through with the use of Deathstokes grappel gun which basicly allows you to pick off up to three enemies with no challenge to it: it's basicly a ranged Inverse takedown. This eliminates the diffliculty of predator rooms.   Then there's the city, the game's hub world. While it is larger than the one in Arkham City, if I remember correctly I've been told it's atleast 3 times as big as the one in AC, it feels empty. There isn't much to do apart from stopping the same general street crimes that pop-up in the city districts (whether it's fighting mobs or beating up gangs it all ends up becoming the same repitative task after a while). The are no riddler trophies or riddles that unlock bonuses and give winks and nods to the batman lore. I understand Edward Nigma hasn't transformed into the Riddler yet, but the replecement collectibles they have in the game just feel inferior compared to the collectibles of past games. There are side-missions you can do, but half of them are straight up copies of the ones present in AC; Instead of blowing up titan containers you're blowing up drug containers, there's the one where you get sucked into Mad Hatters Wonderland, there's the one where you have to track down Deadshot just like you did in AC.   Speaking of Deadshot, one of the biggest flaws in this game is character development. For a game whose whole premise is based around Batman having to defeat eight assassins, the assassins themselves have barely any impact in this game. Assassins like Deathstroke have little to no screen time, they just show-up, you beat them, and you about never see them again. I'm not talking about B or C list characters here, this is Deathstroke, a major player in the DC Universe, a man who has fought the Teen Titans and had multiple comic series. Instead more emphasis is placed on characters like Bane, who has already had screen time in the previous two games. For the most part it just feels like most of the assassins where just there as fan-service instead of actually having a purpose; it's like how people always joke that the Batman story-arc 'Hush' was just an excuse for Jim Lee to draw and include major stars of DC universe, with them having little to add to the overall plot.   But while there's a lot I can criticize about Origins, there are some things it gets right. Like I said earlier the combat is better than ever, not to mention the boss fights, which for the most part, are an improvement over the ones in City and especially Asylum. The voice acting is surprinsgly better than I expected; Troy Baker sounds great as the Joker and overtime Roger Craig Smith starts to grow into the role of Batman, even at some points sounding like a young Kevin Conroy. And while I do think the assassins where underplayed, I'n my opinion James Gordon and Alfred were certainly given the time in the spotlight they rightfully deserve, more so then they were in the past games. But besides that there isn't much I can say good about it.   Like I said from the beginning, Origins is addicting. The comabt is satisfying, I'd dare say even more than City, but it lacks the things AC has that made me 100% it and start on my 5th playthough of it.   It might just be me, I'll admit that. From what I've read in other reviews people have enjoyed this game, and that's good. But in my opinion, as an honest-to-god Batman/Arkham series fanboy, I just can't recommend this game. I wish I could put it into words that would fully convey my dislike towards this game in a way that would allow you to see it the way I do, but I can't. And when I try the only word that comes to mind is the same one I've repeated over and aver again in my review, and that word is 'inferior'. This game is just inferior.   But I'll say again, that's just the way 'I' see it. If you think you'll like it, and it comes on sale, you can buy it and make your own opinion. But if you had to ask me, I would not recommend it.   P.S. I couldn't think of anyplace else add this so I just decided to talk about it here, this has to deal with game's New Game Plus mode. Following in AC's footsteps WB Montrel added a New Game Plus mode that allowed you experience the game a second time with an upgraded Batman. But here's the thing, in AC when you started New Game Plus you had all your gadgets unlocked from the start. This was cool because it allowed you an edge with the harder enemies. But in Origins you don't have your gadgets, you have to unlock them all over again. So I have to ask, what's the point of New Game Plus mode if I don't have my unlockables? That was a just a small nitpick I had with the game that I just needed to talk about.",

            "review_text": "Batman: Arkham Origins manages to be the worst Arkham game that, disappointingly, barely does enough to justify its asking price of £30, especially if you have played Arkham City.   Lets start with the good things.  - The story in Origins is very good, possibly the best out of the current trilogy. While there are pacing problems, the overall plot is deep, thought out and even manages to surprise in a few areas.  - Sound design and the soundtrack are superb; feeling like they had a real production value and weren't just simply overlooked. (unlike some other things)  - The voice acting is incredible, for the most part, with Troy Baker as The Joker stealing the show. (though Roger Craig Smith as Batman does a pretty good job at emulating Kevin Conroy from previous games) I must admit it's jarring to hear Batman's voice at first, (being so used to Conroy's work) but it doesn't take long to get acclimatised, with halfway through the game, barely noticing the difference. - The game manages a decent length of around 10-12 hours for the main story.  Now on to the negatives. - The game world, while being of a decent size, is too cumbersome to travel round. Most of your time in the open world will be spent travelling from A to B by grappling rooftops. The fast travel does alleviate this, but you have to unlock the various points by overtaking radio towers as side missions, making the whole thing feeling a bit like too much work.  - Most of the side missions are now completely seperated from the main plot, they are now mostly unintresting and uninspiring filler. - The combat is only slightly improved from City, and with the inclusion of the new shock gloves, makes it far too easy to beat enemies. - Most of the little refrences and in-jokes to other DC comics which made the previous games that little bit more awesome are gone, it feels like most of the devs aren't as passionate as Rocksteady and it would have be nice for a couple of easter eggs here and there.  - The first part of the plot (about the assassins) doesn't quite gel with the rest of the story and feels like an excuse to shoe horn some D-list DC villans.  - The Penguin's 'assistants' are some of the worst characters I have ever seen in a Batman game. Plus the thick (what I assume is meant to be cockney) accent of one of them is so horrible, it's on par with Bolo Santosi in Just Cause 2.  - While I haven't played much of the multiplayer and while it was fun, it lacks depth to keep my interest, making it only passable at best. - The biggest flaw of Arkham Origins, however, is its MOUNTAIN OF BUGS. While most of the game breaking bugs have been reportedly fixed, there are still a plethora of visual bugs, such as the skybox having circular clouds covering it, textures spazzing out and not unlocking certain areas of the game. Fortunately, in my personal experience, all it needs it a checkpoint restart. Others haven't been so lucky. As WB Montreal aren't fixing the game anymore a minority will most likely never finish the game, buy at your own risk.  This game is nowhere near worth its full asking price, and some of it is really good and well done, which only makes it more painful to say that if you have never played the Arkham games NEVER EVER PLAY THIS. If you have played the previous two then wait for a sale, only then it will be worth at least a vague look.  4/10",

Shock gloves were awesome to use since they were so powerful too.  Cons: -Buggy as ♥♥♥♥.

Not only did they recycle it though, you fight him again later in Origins, and it's the same fight but with more anonymous henchmen thrown in. The other fights, while neat to watch, are pretty quick time event heavy. -Only one new gadget is cool, Glue Grenades. Everything else feels like a gimmick or has been in a previous game in the series. -Collectibles feel worthless.

Batman sometimes has real trouble figuring out if he's gliding or falling and other times whether he's grabbing a ledge or falling past it. So even the engine is a step backwards. Lastly the storyline....this game does not feel like an 'origin' story. I think whoever decide to go with 'origin' was not connected to the rest of the development team. Batman is already well kitted out at the start of the game and there is little-to-no development into how he becomes later Batman. Character-wise and technology-wise he already is (Grapnel-Boost?).

It's extremely forgettable and bland. I never want to explore because there is nothing that really stands out. It's just one big grey bland mess and the only thing that stands out is your waypoint.

The combat felt off in Origins and for the longest time I had trouble figuring out why. But during the halfway point, I think I figured it out: The baddie placement. In the previous games, lots of care had been taken in picking which baddies work in what amounts and when special enemies were needed. Here it seems like more of a copy-paste job, carelessly throwing in specials even if their abilities severely hinders the combat. It leads to a lot of frustration and eagerness to get out of combat, something the series hasn't had an issue with until now.  In terms of new content, Arkham Origins is kind of bare bones. You have a majority of your old weapons available to you very early and some new ones that, unfortunately, don't mean much in combat. Some of the items feel completely shoehorned in, such as the Sonic Batarang. Not only did it seemingly just appear in my inventory, but there is never any sort of need for it or tactical advantage for using it. So why is it here?   The story is fairly muddled. It starts off with Black Mask hiring 8 supervillanous hitmen to take you down on Christmas Eve. Why Christmas Eve? 'Who cares' is the answer the game gives. The story actually rehashes some villains, such as Bane, the Riddler, the Penguin, and Deadshot. Unfortunately there isn't much to talk about when it comes to the plot without getting into spoilers. It's not exactly clear why Black Mask hired the assassins in the first place and by the end of the game it's even more confusing. Topping that off, the game ends seemingly out of nowhere, in what I thought was the beginning of the third act. It just sort of stops.   There are still a handful of graphical errors and strange Not to mention several game-stopping glitches I encountered in-game despite the titles having been out for 5 months.  I don't really think fans of the last two Arkham games will get much out of Arkham Origins, it feels like microwave leftovers. The only people I would recommend this to are die-hard fans of the games or Batman in-general, and even then I would recommend getting it at a low price.

It also didn't quite capture the feel of the first two games, which had very beautiful scenery and atmospheres. This game abandoned that and replaced it with very, very gray and dark areas. The first two games had a very smooth combat system, where the game would instantly respond to your inputs, but this game somehow managed to break it, leaving behind very low-accuracy attacks, and counters that sometimes wouldn't even respond (which is especially obvious during the deathstroke fight, which basically is a mashup between counters and quick time events that almost certainly miss, causing a more difficult than it should be fight). The predator system is very different from the last two, pretty much only having one way to clear a room without being detected, unlike the numerous ways to do so before. The game also suffers from having gameplay and story segregated heavily, such as the grapnel boost, which was supposedly in experimental phase during Arkham City, with this being a prequel, it doesn't make that much sense at all. Finally, the story wasn't very engaging either. Hopefully the next installment can be made by Rocksteady again and we can forget this slip as soon as possible.",

I have a great bias towards giving this game a thumbs up. You see, I'm a huge batman fan. (there I said it! I'm a comic weeabo gheesh get off of me.) So as I have a sort of bias towards it I went and took as much of a sceptic approach towards it as I could.   So let's start with the plot and characters  SPOILERS! (duh)  Our protagonist is the one and only Batman/Bruce Wayne. He's hasn't quite garnered the reputation that he had in the previous installments of the franchise, which is strange since you'd think they'd release the prequels first and then the sequels? Well I'm just derailing here. Anyway Batman finds himself in Blackgate prison... There's a lot of ruckus and blah blah blah.... AAAAAAAAAAND! SKABLUSH! Assasins!  You heard me right! ASSASINS! SPOOOOOOKYYY! (derailed again? okay...) Anyhow there are Assasins going after Batman hired by a criminal leader called 'Black Mask'. (although later we'll find out that this is not infact Black Mask but an ellaborate roose!) And on goes a game of Cat and Mouse.  So whose the cat and who's the mouse you might ask? Ummmm. Well.... It's cleary! No that's not it.... I haven't got the faintest clue to be honest. It's a very strange plotline where it sometimes seems like it's trying to give you a sense of danger even though you are 100% in control. And the only time the game gives you a feeling of despair is when it shoves it down your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ throat by getting you poisoned or some other shennanigans.  The best part of the story and the characters (as always when it comes to Batman) Is delivered in the form of the Joker. dear lord is it good. Even though we no longer have my beloved Mark Hamil lending his voice for the Prince of Chaos it's still a fantasticly delivered character. It's just too bad he has to be outrun by some bland boring characters who are taking his show away. Dear lord I wish he'd get to be on the spotlight the entire game.  The game has your typical: Batman beats up joker, joker in jail things are fine BUT THERE ARE STILL THINGS TO DO! (aka. We needed to extend your playtime so we gave you a good ol blast of side missions since we can't deliver on the entire experience in the main storyline part.)   Well but the gameplay. Oh the gameplay. This is a part I think my bias isn't worth mentioning on because I truly think the execution of the combat and everything else was downright lazy. They ♥♥♥♥ed up in some of the interiors of the game where enemies will get stuck inside walls and you won't be able to progress because you have to defeat them all requiring you to reload the game and pray on your knees they are not stuck again.  Well and the bossfights. The one thing the previous games did bloody amazingly (excluding the Joker fight in Arkham Asylum.) this game managed to ♥♥♥♥ up. The bossfights are mainly QTE's or annoying in some other ballbusting way.  God this makes me steamed up.   But overall I semt to enjoy the game quite a bit.  The athmosphere is magnificant and a lot of the voice acting is top notch with some real talent behind the characters. But anything else I really can't grant the game.   So unfortunately I'm going to have to give it a no. If you want a good Batman game, go play Arkham City.",

On the one hand, you could say that if you play them in order (Origins, Asylum, then City) that it would get progressively better to the point of getting a bat boner...and that's fine. Origins suffers from just plain bad design.  The map is too large. It's large for the sake of being large. With the other Arkham games, the maps were large, but they were chock full of interesting content. This was an obvious cash-in title, so while there are things that I like, the game focuses way too much on collectibles to the point I thought this was Banjo-Kazooie. Riddler trophies range from stupidly simple to annoying.  At least in Arkham City even the easy trophies required a bit of puzzle elements to navigate through. Most of the easy trophies in this game involve randomly tripping over them or shocking something, then just pick it up or whatever. But by far the worst part of this game, and I'm going to try to be as spoiler free as possible, is the final villain. Such an obvious choice after presenting so many different characters that only the most diehard Batman fans will know about (Firefly, Deathstroke, Shiva, Black Mask, Electrocutioner, etc.).  And the events leading up to the final fight? What, a brute fight with advanced enemies, an advanced enemy mob fight, a repeat of the Mr. Freeze fight from Arkham City but not as good, then a couple of counters and a stupid beatdown sequence. It wasn't bad enough that the game had a higher encounter rate than older Final Fantasy titles or that it was obviously trying desperately to be Arkham City and falling WAY short, then they completely screw up the final act like that.  I won't say to save your money. It's still part of the Arkham series and is actually fun. Just keep in mind that it's a very weak entry. I'm still looking forward to Arkham Knight and even the 2.5D Blackgate game, but I've heard they also aren't that great. If you don't own Arkham Asylum and City, get those instead.

Then there's the challenges, which again also have to be done in a certain order to gain the XP. Side missions are again pasted from City. The only thing that's stopping this game from being completely pointless is the story. Seeing the characters when they are younger is quite interesting, but the story lacks focus it jumps around too much. Then there's the bugs. Performance issues aside, there are a number of game-breaking bugs which can be avoided with caution but persist throughout the game. It's also difficult to tell where to go in some parts of the game. The multiplayer is tacked on, and doesn't even work most of the time on PC. The concept and class system and stuff is all just flawed and tacked on for the sake of it. Overall, Arkham Origins has solid foundations but fails to expand upon them. Unless you're a big fan of Arkham City or Batman in general, I wouldn't recommend this game over Arkham City.",

            "review_text": "Arkham Origins isn't a bad game, but I wouldn't recommend that someone who hasn't played it play it. I've played it for about 30 hours and let me tell you it's just not worth it. I was one of the biggest fans of Arkham City, that was 'my game'. I loved it so much that after playing hundreds of hours on PS3 I bought it on steam and played another 50+ hours. I put a lot of faith in the new developer and they let me down. There are things that I really liked about this game, but the cons far outweigh the pros. For one, the costume designs for batman and the bosses are sick. I could tell that a lot of time was put in to designing the appearences. Batman's suit looks like he put it together himself with all the individual pieces, the straps, and the bulkiness as opposed to Arkham City and Asylum Asylum where the suit looks professionally manufactured with the whole suit being one kind of layered material, strips of it bolted down, and looks really slim. Deathstroke also looks awesome with his professional armor over the chainmail underarmor. The story is pretty good and I cared about Batman more than I did in Arkham City due to the strong voice acting. The visual style for this game is pretty slick too with it resembling Mass Effect more than photorealism. Thats pretty much where I stop liking this game and start having problems with it. My problem with the story is that it focused way too much on Bane and Joker and not enough on the characters that are new to the series. I love Bane and Joker, but I had seen pretty much all I needed to of them in AC and AA. Previews of the game made it appear that the main villians would be Black Mask and Deathstroke, something that I was looking forward to. In the beginning, Black Mask looked like a bad ♥♥♥ and got me really excited for therest of the story. I spoil anything, but Black Mask gets portrayed as a complete ♥♥♥♥♥ after the big plot twist. I was expecting Deathstroke to be a complex character and have a big role in the story and to play as him in the open world like the Catwoman missions in AC. However, the only exposure you get to him is the five minute boss fight and a glimpse of him later in the game. That's it. After all the screenshots and artwork showing Deathstorke released and the build up about him being in AO, I was expecting a little more than that. Not only did that disappoint me, but the playable Deathstroke has almost all the same moves as Robin from AC. That especially ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off because of all the effort Rocksteady made to make their playable characters have unique fighting styles. Lastly is the combat. It is almost identical to AC, except it is more frustrating in a few ways. One way is that on hard, I start to punch an enemy, then another enemy begins to punch me, and the enemy that was beginning his punch will finish his before I finish mine. Another way is the addition of the new enemies. WB didnt inherit this code from Rocksteady and had to create it themselves. This where the combat can get a bit buggy. Theres a lot of confusing moments with the new enemies because sometimes their moves will work and not work when I evade/counter/stun. Rocksteady's combat was so well polished and WB didn't take the time to make their additions work correctly. I would like enemies like the martial artist more if it wasnt the same 3 counter animations being used everytime and I would have liked it even more if WB hadnt added those same counter animations to the normal enemies. Also, the challenge maps in AC were so distinct with unique environments, colors, and enemy combinations. In AO, I can barely tell any of them apart. With few eaxceptions, they are all white and grey with the same enemy combinations. I was fortunate enough not to encounter any of the game breaking bugs that many others have experienced. I would say something about the multiplayer but I have yet been able to access it. Thats pretty much how I feel about this game. I think it was a poor decision for WB to make another Arkham game just to release one before Rocksteady is finished with next game. I suggest that anyone who hasn't played this game wait until Rocksteady releases their next Arkham game.",

            "review_text": "Having completed the prior two games, I think I'm spoiled. Arkham Origins isn't all in all a bad game, and it's especially not bad for a superhero game, but it pales compared to the earlier two. In short, if you want Batman, play Arkham Asylum or Arkham City. If you have played both, wait for Arkham Knight. I can't recommend Arkham Origins.  Compared to the earlier two games: - The plot is inferior. Rather than the ride Joker takes you on, or the twists and turns of City, it's just 'here's a bunch of 3rd Tier villains, fight them.' Gone is the deep plotting of Hugo Strange. Gone is the long con of Joker. Now it's just a set of bosses to fight. - The combat is more finicky. Combos break abruptly, attacks swing in the air instead of jumping to another target, commands occasionally just don't get recognized. Getting a high combo is harder than it was. - The bosses are terrible. In particular, Deathstroke, Firefly and Bane are some of the most tedious fights in memory. I'd rather the repeated Titan battles from Asylum. Deathstroke more than anything is a sheer-cliff difficulty spike such that he's become notorious, and he even has an achievement for a perfect victory... which is next to impossible as countering his attacks is glitched and occasionally he becomes unblockable. - The bosses aren't anyone we care about. I'm fine with Black Mask and Deathstroke appearing, but Firefly? Copperhead? Shiva? Electrocutioner? I miss Clayface, Two-Face, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy... - The city layout is vastly inferior. Too many impassible buildings and invisible walls end up limiting you to a few ways to get around the city instead of freedom. The bridge is annoying and much too long considering how often you have to cross it. And hey, look, it's snowing in winter as goons complain about the cold again. It would be deja vu if it weren't so much worse of a layout. - Besides layout issues, too many paths are restricted to the one and only way the devs wanted them passed. One ledge can be grappled, but not climbed up to otherwise. Another ledge the same height can be climbed, but not grappled. Another ledge much like the first two can only be accessed with the Remote Claw. What's the difference? Just which tool the devs liked that day. There's no flexibility. - The challenges were not apparently tested. In order to obtain all the equipment (ex. Sonic Batarang), Batman has to complete 60 challenges, such as getting a 20x variation in combat, or completing a room without being spotted. Unfortunately, they must be done in order, so that 23x variation you got earlier won't count if you weren't up to that challenge yet. Worse, some of them can only be accomplished in one spot in the entire game, so you'd better be ready before getting there and you'd better accomplish it right there, or you can never go further in the challenges and can never unlock the remaining items. Terrible. - Bugs. The major showstoppers have been fixed so the game can be completed now, but Batman still fails to glide sometimes, enemies still fail to spawn sometimes, interrogation prompts fail to trigger sometimes, enemies clip through walls sometimes, punches in combat fail to connect sometimes, combat button presses utterly fail to register frequently, and I've never run into a game that makes my PC run so hot before, including games with higher system reqs. But hey, at least we know the devs will never patch it again because they'd rather sell more DLC instead. - Stupid DLC. Preorder bonuses and separate purchasable DLCs mostly give you extra costumes (even though they're mainly just alternate shades of gray), but you can't use them. You have to complete the game then start over a New Game Plus before you can wear the costumes you paid money for. Why? Arkham City allowed played to enter a code to access costumes in the first play through, but that has been removed in Origins.  I would like to include a list of improvements over the earlier games for the sake of fairness, but I can't think of anything it really does better than earlier titles. The Batcave feels more lived-in, but that's about it.  On the whole, yes there can be fun here. It's still an Arkham game, still has freeflow combat, still lets you punch goons as the Batman. But I can't recommend it when there are two better games available as GOTY editions and a newer game coming out soon.",

I liked the previous two installments of the series and so I decided to hold off on playing the game for a couple of years, let it age like fine wine. Really, what I got was vinegar.  My initial playthrough was fine, I knew I would be a little bit awkward as I got used to using an Xbox controller over keyboard and mouse, but once I got to the first boss fight, I couldn't help feeling like the controls were unresponsive, or at least the attack indicators didn't match up with my window to avoid the bosses attacks.  Next came the open world and it felt kind of empty. Scattered pockets of a very small variety of thugs and pickups to acquire. I figured that maybe if I pushed on and got through more story things would fill up. This is where I was starting to get annoyed with the gameplay.  Since I played the previous games I had a little bit of previous knowledge as to how the game worked, stuns, dodges, takedowns, etc. But this didn't gel with the fact that I was playing a prequel to the Arkham adventures. As a result, there were several points where I was confused and frustrated that I didn't have X ability yet. I couldn't grab thugs or pickups with the batclaw, I didn't have a faster means to fly across the map, even combat felt janky when I successfully dodged a knife attack only for Bats and the thug to awkwardly pose and then not know what to do with themselves. I knew I should be able to punish the thug and perform a takedown, but the game didn't. Even when I got the knife takedown upgrade it didn't seem to work.  My frustration doubled when I tried to find how to get my abilities back and saw the upgrade menu. I don't recall the Arkham City upgrade screen very well, but this one was really obtuse, especially when it felt like upgrades were hidden behind achievements and didn't explain themselves well, like 'Get to Dark Night achievement level 10 to unlock'. Was that my character level? Did they mean Achievements with a capital 'A'? The headers didn't match, it felt disconnected and I wasn't grasping anything. Now I was lost in regards to gameplay as well as the story.  Then this morning I decided to give the game another chance, switching over to KB+M since mashing the X button on the controller was starting to become painful. Lo and behold, crash on title screen. Application was stuck open and was causing Task Manager to become unresponsive and pretty well blacked out one of my monitors. Restart, try again, same song and dance. Spent the better part of an hour troubleshooting, verifying integrity cache, reinstalling, restarting, and deleting my save which seemed to have been corrupted. No dice.  If you got it working on your machine, if you haven't played Batman since Arkham City and wanted to try it, be my guest, but I don't have time for this sort of quackery.",

He has a hook, another hook, a boomerang, another boomerang, a different boomerang, a different type of hook altogether, and a sonic screwdriver that does anything the plot demands it to do.  Sometimes you look at crime scenes. There are many secrets to be found here. Can you find out who stole the cookies from the cookie jar? I bet you can't!  Run, jump, and fight your way through one really large city that was pretty much lifted directly from the last game. Really, it's kind of sad.  Batman: Arkham Origins. Buying this is like putting money in Josef Goebbels' pocket, in that you probably shouldn't do it because it supports bad business practices and anti-semitism.",

A full, detailed explanation of all of this game's shortcomings would take an hour. Or four. And no, I am NOT exaggerating.  A list made from my overall analysis would be: -Bugs and glitches are far too copious within combat, often ruining scenarios that took quite a lot of diligent planning. Missed hits due to the game not being able to follow the direction of your controls, combo-breakers due to the game insisting on making martial artists buggy messes, and horrible enemy prioritizing.  -Within specific areas of the game, massive framerate drops will occur, even on low settings, causing defeat at the hands of even simple enemies because you won't even know what the hell is going on. -Needless additions to combat, such as combo-breaking upon hitting armored targets with Batarangs, or Batman pounding any enemy's face after a successful Aerial Attack, leaving him vulnerable, are, without better words, cancerous. -Skyscrapers that we used to be able to grapple onto in the previous installment, Arkham City, are now just decorations with no use outside of being there to remind you you're in a city. -The Coventry is, for some reason, infested with omnipresent and omniscient snipers that literally shred you even in midair, without giving you much of a chance to defend yourself. -The Dark Knight challenges are bugged and are needlessly frustrating. And the payoff is vomit-inducing in its laziness. -Guns are now used in every combat scenario, even when freeroaming on Normal, and for some reason, the enemies reload within milliseconds and can hit you better than Deadshot, despite the swarms of other enemies surrounding you.  -The aforementioned Dark Knight challenges are required for upgrades. *FACEPALM -During Predator scenarios, enemies will sometimes randomly spin around in circles even when unprovoked, such as during the VERY BEGINNING OF A PREDATOR SCENARIO. They spot immediately you as you're trying to sneak up on them, and go guns-a-blazin' 'Murica style on your miserable ♥♥♥.  -Did I mention the glitches? And the FPS drop? Yes? Well then expect a trillion of those for every enemy you face.  Those are just of the GAMEPLAY complaints, however. The story-related elements also have downfalls. -The Joker is the big twist. Really? Joker?  -Black Mask is a punching bag for every plot point. -The game contradicts Batman's supposed 'inexperience' with the circumstances regarding his battles so much that you'll eventually run out of pejoratives to yell at the screen. -A plot hole regarding Bane is so mind-numbingly stupid that it will literally make you facepalm your brains through your skull. -A few dialougue sections are cheesy as hell.  Then there's Deathstroke: -He's a reskin of Robin. The slow, sluggish Robin who makes you paranoid in combat every time.  -He's glitchy (not as much as Batman, but still enough to incense you at certain points) -He seems like a chump in this game (Seriously? A ROOKIE Batman beating the man who can take on ten thousand elite ninja assassins without getting a scratch in a hand-to-hand fight single-handedly? Jesus Christ, the downplay is real.) -He's beaten way too early on, despite being hyped as the best villain in the game. -He doesn't play big role at all.  Then there are the cases of direct incompetence from WB Montreal: -The Dark Knight skin is a recolour of the default skin, but yet has the same damage as the default skin -There are missing textures for character models as well as a missing cape for the Injustice skin, which is by far the BEST available skin in the game. - The Worst Nightmare skin, which would have been THE best skin, was removed from the game simply because the developers were too autistic to simply fix a programming error with it. A simple error. -How does this all tie into their incompetence directly, you ask? Well, they went on record and said TO OUR FACES that they would rather focus on DLCS than on fixing all the bugs and major glitches that plague the game.   Yep, that's all I can say. But it's only all the NEGATIVE things I can say.  There are actually a lot of things the game did right: -The conflict between Alfred and Bruce is actually ensible and you actuallt are able to fully sympathize with both sides. -The overall execution of the story was fluid and good. -The soundtrack was a big plus and a real gem. -The boss fights were EXHILARATING! From the insane platforming ranged combat of the explosive Firefly battle to the hair-trigger duel of Deathstroke and Batman (despite the latter being nonsense), they're all fun. You'll even get a good chuckle out of Electrocutioner (a roaring symphony of laughter if you have friends with you) -The predator encounters were much easier than in previous games, and are actually enjoyable because of it. -The new innovations to combat, such as critical counters and double special combos are greatly appreciated. -The side missions are a blast. The Most Wanted encounters are unique in their own ways and the Crime Scene Investigations are perfect with the fancy new Detective Vision feature.  -Voice acting is great. -The usage of the Shock Gloves is justified and fun. -Bane is portrayed in a much better light here than in previous games.  However, none of these really excuse the mistakes of the whole package. And just to be clear, I HAVE played through a huge majority of all the game, and am at near 100% completion, with the only chores left being finishing New Game + and I Am The Night. Neither of which I look forward to. I'm not even going to touch multiplayer because of my previous experience with games simply not suited to multiplayer as well as the plethora of horror stories I have heard about it.   Edit: I have played I Am the Night mode. But halfway through, an enemy with a sniper detected me somehow, even though I was about sixty feet above him. He proceeded to kill me unexpectedly. ♥♥♥♥ this game.  Final Verdict: 2/10",

The multiplayer community (last I checked) was all but dead (not that thats surprising, the people who made the multiplayer have a bad track record, i.e. Brink). There aren't 'new' gadgets, just replacements; the glue grenade replaced the ice grenade in BMAC (Batman Arkham City if you couldn't guess), the line launcher was replaced with the remote claw, etc. And I don't really like the remote claw really, stealth lost a good chunk of its difficulty now you can just string up crooks from across the room with it. The story for me was 'meh', The Joker took over the plot ,as he always does, and most of the other villans are the minor ones who aren't popular. I'm not saying lesser known villans are a bad thing, but most of them aren't popular for a reason. Then the fact the game is a prequel. BMAC lost all it's momentum when they made a prequel, they could have easily brought a strong sequel instead, they didn't need to bring the Joker back, what about Hush and Scarecrow they had instances in BMAC that forshadowed them coming back. The only thing that stuck out for me was 'I am the Night' mode, because of the tension of knowing that your save is lost when you die. Outside the obvious differences the the game is a copy of BMAC, that being said, the game is still good and fun, but i can only recommend if you played the heck out of the games before it and want more Arkham. If not, just get Arkham City, it's cheaper and is virtually the same game. One can only hope that 'Arkham Knight' won't be such a letdown.   UPDATE: So Cold Cold Heart been out for awhile now and I persoanlly kinda find it average. it was cool exploring Freeze's origin story but the dlc had a fair amount of backtracking. Not that it has ever happened before, but I feel like we shouldn't have to constantly backtrack to the same place multiple times in a 3 hour dlc. I also encountered in my playthrough a bug in the 'My Alibi' nightclub where I had to start all over because I fell through the floor, and my game decided to auto-save while I was falling. Some time after that I noticed some other bugs. An informant for me is displayed on the map, but hasn't spawned. Meaning that one set of riddler data can't be revealed on my map unless I manually find them or look up online how to get to them. It's not the worst thing in the word, but it is extremely annoying. Another bug I've encounter is the Reverse-Batarang. It flat-out doesn't work. What it is supposed to do is distract enemies and make them look the other way. Nope, doesn't happen, the AI treats it like a normal batarang, looking straight at where I was when I threw it.In the same session after this I got sniped through an entire building. Not one wall, and entire building, ou could see the laser going through the skyscraper from where I knew there was a nest of snipers.",

Sadly the game was a massive failure to the Arkham franchise, never had I waited for a game to end more than this. In the 17 or so hours it took for me to complete the game, half the time Arkham City took I might add, I experienced roughly the same systems in place as the first two with little changes to the formula other than a game breaking weapon given late game, numerous QTEs and a massive amount cinematic sequences. This game had so much going for it coming from a fantastic couple of preceding games but takes the name and combat system alone and adds nothing but boredom to the equation. Many of the assassins battles are more spectacle than substance and lack the punch the earlier games had going for them. The cinematics, while good looking, merely add to the length of the game with few even necessary to the narrative as a whole. The most troubling of the additions are the numerous quick time events. These make portions of the game feel 'press-to-win' especially when the majority of them are in the games most desperate situations. There are several graphical and system bugs in the game as well which make it visually unappealing during some of the most enjoyable parts including one of my favorite features of the series gliding high above the city streets. The game also often crashes on exiting the game and the controls seem less responsive which makes combat seem like a gamble of timing more than a show of skill. Something was lost in the series between changing developers and it has suffered a great blow. This installment is not worthy of the series and I am truly glad to say that it is not a necessity to play or even own.",

The game mechanics didnt see much innovation since the first two games, and I feel like the main story itself was overpromised. The first Bane fight was way more difficult than it should have been, his charging attack was very difficult to avoid so it took me &gt;20 tries to beat him THE FIRST TIME. Then you fight him later where he does the same attacks, so the game just had us fight the same boss twice. I also like to achievement hunt, and I think that multiplayer achievements are an abomination. I think a lot of the work that could have gone into the single player story of the game instead went into making the multiplayer. I haven't had the chance to try the multiplayer, so I can't comment on it's quality, but I feel like it is not needed in a game like this. I wouldn't have written this review, but after I finished the main story I started to run around to complete the side missions. I encountered a bug where Batman gets stuck in a nightclub, which can't be fixed by reloading/ restarting the game. I looked for anyone else who had this problem, and there was a post from TWO YEARS AGO where people also had the same problem. I had noticed a few minor bugs either in combat or weird flying patterns, which weren't a big deal. However if the developer can't patch a huge bug like the one I encountered in two whole years, I get the feeling they don't care about their customers.",

I have used older not-compromised savegames and it happened again. I'm totally aware that any game has bugs of its own.

            "review_text": "While I would not recommend Batman Arkham Origins. I would not say it is a terrible game. It is however a game with a great premise that (in my opinion) fails to deliver.  Somehow the gameplay during combat feels less smooth than Arkham City, don't get me wrong, Arkham City's combat was not perfect, but something about Origin's combat feels a little more... 'jagged'? Perhaps it's just me...    PROS:    Arkham Origins has some crowning moments of Gameplay and Plot that are seriously enjoyable:   First Half of the Final Offer Mission (Up until its Boss Battle)   Gotham Royal Hotel Mission   Gotham Pioneer's Bridge Mission (and it's Immediate Aftermath)   Cold Cold Heart (DLC)    Soundtrack    CONS:     BUGS BUGS BUGS  Examples Include But are not Limited to:   Batman's Constantly Jiggling Cape (it's really annoying)   Thugs Hanging from Cords Violently bouncing up and down like a yoyo in the hands of an angry child that does not know how to use a yo-yo.   Spaztic Banners/Belts/Bandannas    Disappearing Enemies   Reappearing Enemies   Two Completely Different Conversations occuring simulatiously during plot critical moments   Meeting the criteria of a challenge/acheivement (multiple times) and not receive reward for said challenge/acheivement   Randomly being awarded random challenge rewards/acheivements without meeting their respective criteria    Repetative Detective Cases   Scan Crime Scene -&gt; Go to the Perp's Location -&gt; Beat Up the Perp    Not enough Predator Missions during Story Mode, which could perhaps be a result of the the game's main plot being rather short (expanded upon below)   Everybody and their mother is a crook in Gotham. With so many thugs on the streets (and on the rooftops), the criminal population seems rather disproportionate to the population of non-criminals.    Plot:    Lot's of Filler between missions (so much that there are multiple nonsensical moments when Alfred notifies Batman of an opportunity to finish up another objective, and Batman basically tells him 'I don't have time Alfred'), and without them I'd imagine that that actual 'Story' is rather short.   Climaxes WAY too early, leaving one wanting for the game to end long before it finally arrives.    Bane has a grudge against Batman. Nobody knows why.   A certain villain discovers Batman's identity, and while an extremely lame plot device (and some hand waving) was used to explain why his memory of Batman's true identity is erased, he had plenty of devoted followers who could have easily reminded him of it.    In Challenges Deathstroke is just a reskin of Robin from Arkham City with a Gun instead of Shuriken.    In Conclusion  Arkham Origins a handful of really great moments and a great soundtrack, but it's failings far outshine its postives and ultimately falls short of the mark. Honestly, even though the game does have replay value (New Game +, I am the Night Mode, Challenges, etc.) I find it really difficult to want to go back and play it again. Actually playing this game all the way through the Story Mode and the Cold, Cold Heart DLC, made me not want to play video games at all for at least a week.  So. Would I reccomend Arkham Origins? No. Is it a bad game? No. Is it a game I would want to play again? Probably not for a very long time.  Honestly, I got the entire game on sale for about $11 (with all DLC included), and I don't feel ripped off, the game feels like a roughly $10 game, but I was also expecting to be disappointed going into it. If you are going to put down money for this game, definitely pick it up during a Holiday sale.",

Control is terrible, movement is very slow, and the game is very confused. Usually, diving / crouching will fix the issue. Usually. You will find yourself unable to complete certain encounters and events, because you randomly can not interrogate foes. This is especially problematic post-credits. (And yes, the credits are 32 minutes long, and cannot be skipped.) You will find the game randomly not working. Freeze followed by crash to desktop; often at a check point, leaving your game stuck at that spot. Really. Search for Copperhead crash, you'll find many instances of it.  The main story is 10 to 16 hours of gameplay. The sidequests are another 10 to 20 hours (including all of those dang riddler items). Plus however long you take to play the challenge maps, and if you do any of the multi-player stuff.

There are no civilians to speak of, just 100% roving gangs, and the city manages to feel drearily devoid of life. The layouts of the internal areas are re-used repeatedly, only changing a little window dressing and adding enemies who are more annoying than the previous revision of that room.  SIde missions are repetitive and feel tacked-on. The banter between riddler and batman feels forced, and makes it almost painful to keep trophy hunting.  The Mr Freeze DLC they had the audacity to charge for is an exact dupe of the boss fight from Arkham City. Strongly recommend you avoid this DLC if you've already played Arkham City.  I really can't recommend this game, unless you're in an extreme drought.

The claw gun is one of the few bright spots of the game, but even it is marred by being too easily exploitable in predator encounters. The leveling system is horrible, shoehorning the player into getting health before skills that would negate the need for more health - it feels as if the designers knew Batman would get his ♥♥♥ handed to him early on, and instead of fixing the broken mechanics that render skill at the core gameplay useless they simply made Batman slightly harder to knockout.  What makes it worse, paradoxically, is that for the most part the story is halfway decent. Yes, it lacks any semblance of structure starting out, and goes too long in the end, but it's a fascinating look at early Batman. Little things like thugs shouting, 'Holy crap, did he just summon bats?!' mid fight are awesome accoutrements to an otherwise flagging game.  Play it if it's on sale (at least 75% off) and you're a completionist for the series, but expect controller breaking frustration if you're even halfway skilled at the other games in the series.

The original developers of Arkham Asylum and City were highly praised for their work so the devs of Arkham Origins have some pretty big boots to fill.  Sadly they fall quite short. The overall quality of the game is lacking and the game world and environment just feels bland and emotionless. This is mostly because the attention to detail is lacking. They only looked at the greater scale of things but did not pay any attention to detail. Be it in gameplay, in the environment or in any element of the game actually.  For example, while Batman is talking, his mouth does not move. The textures are bland and lack detail. The hidden items are not hidden very well and most of the time just feel like they randomly placed them in a location. The puzzles are all the same and only rely on having all the gadgets but you don't need to figure out anything. The combat system is more or less identical to the previous titles but with some bugs added to it. All again due to lack of attention to detail. They implemented features and gameplay elements but did not really pay attention to what they were doing or go back and check if it actually works correctly. Another example of this lack of attention is in the fast travel, you really have to be careful about using the fast travel because if the game suddenly forgot to auto save after completing an objective (which does happen sometimes) then if you fast travel you actually lose your progress back to the previous save. Had they paid attention they would have made the game save before fast travelling to avoid these kind of issues.  While yes, Arkham Origins is fun, but only due to the elements they took over from the previous two Arkham titles. As a result there is nothing fresh to offer here. The story is pretty boring and lacks emotion. The voicework is bland and again, boring. While the characters just are not that interesting this time around. Also, Batman really needs to learn to stop letting Bane pick him up lol and in the time of 5 minutes, Batman made the same mistake towards Bane. I mean like come on, seriously??? Who the hell wrote this game :S  To avoid going on endlessly, in summary: The game is fun due to what made the previous titles fun, but don't expect anything new or fresh and in fact. This experience is actually quite a bit less than that of both Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.  It will be interesting to see what they do on Arkham Knight now that it is again the original developers.  I have put as recommendation No as in general you will want to watch out how much you spend on this title. It is good for a solid 20 hours of play time just to finish the main campaign and then on top of that there is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer mode that wears off quickly which is good for a few more hours of fun. If you really want to go the full 100% though you can count on a solid 25-30 hours on the campaign.  Again, it is fun, but just very disappointing.",

If you know nothing about Batman, and this is your first time playing this series, then this would be a great place to start. I felt as though the story was lack-luster, and while the assassin boss fights were cool, I beat this game without ever fighting several of the assassins, and without feeling any desire to explore about half of the map. (Yes, you can fight all the assassins, but some of them end up as side-missions that are predator mode and not at all like the boss fights.)",
