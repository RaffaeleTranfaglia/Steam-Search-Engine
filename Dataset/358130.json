You often find tigers, gorillas, and other creatures that want to kill you. You also go crazy and hungry.  It's not an easy game. I'm 3 hours into it - I will probably get at least 20-30 out of the game. It's pretty original and fun. Love it.",

I would really like to see some more random elements thrown in in the future to add more replayability. Once you've played 2-3 hours you know more or less every encounter and how to get the upper hand. Wouldnt recommend it at its current price tag (15 EURO) but for anything under 10 EURO this is a great little game worth every penny.",

            "review_text": "This game is not what is seems to be.  It claims to be a game about exploring and discovery with some RPG elements, it mentions being rogue-like.  What it really is another RNG fueled disaster where you're supposed to glean some kind of fun out of while every action you make burns down the world around you, none of your actions seem carry any consequence/reward of note, and you're flooded with pointlessly cruel and illogical events based on your 'sanity' - which is only recoverable very situationally, and often times at the cost of driving your expedition to insanity itself (through drugs, alcohol, and other ailments).  The 'point' is to find the 'golden pyramid' on each expedition - but there's no hint as to which direction one has to go from the start to find it, ultimately resulting the player ping-ponging from point of interest to point of interest - marked with an innovative '?' on a map hex - or seeking high ground to find more '?'s to bounce off of.  The greatest enemy you're fighting is 'sanity' - a pink bar which drops every time you move and increases only when you consume mind-altering substances (this seems very flawed to me) or sleep - which you're only allowed to do at villages or in random 'natural camp sites', unless you somehow managed to buy/find a tent (worth more than most 'gold' artifacts, yet still only provides barely more sanity than a jug of booze, and provides lovely event oppurtunities like 'this guy lost a photograph of his wife' or 'this person lost a charm bracelet' which, if failed [random dice roll], leads to more sanity loss and people getting upset, completely negating the rare item you just wasted).  Which leads us to the real flaw: there is no opportunity to restock the supplies that matter, and expedition size &amp; inventory space is cripplingly restrictive. Before you leave for each expedition, you can buy supplies, but they're all supplies which make movement easier, and given the limited space for supplies, I'd rather maintain my group's sanity. But I cannot buy booze, tents, or any other sanity restoring substances/items while 'restocking' for the next expedition.  It's like 2 or 3 people made the game, working independently on different parts of the game to deliver on - but in the end none of them actually finished their part and they threw it all together with some RNG and called it 'rogue-like', and now they want $15....",

Both are very good, but, all things considered, it saddens me to say (as a fan of the TCE since beta) that in the end i think RE is the better game. ",
