My only criticism is that the mouse input feels extremely sluggish, it would be better if this game took advantage of hardware cursor input.",

Enjoy !!!",

            "review_text": "A decent enough game if you can get it cheap and enjoyed Lemmings. Strangely it seems to lack a lot of the charm of Lemmings despite being almost exactly the same game. I think the problem is the physics engine, it makes the game more about getting the timing bang on right rather than trying to solve a puzzle. This makes it very unforgiving and it's easy to lose all your sheep because you were half a second off the pace required for the level.  Unfortunately there is a massive problem with the controls for the game. Even with the mouse sensitivitly turned right down the game pans from one side of the map to the other in the blink of an eye and zoom seems to be all or nothing.",
