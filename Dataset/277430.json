The levels are short &amp; simple, so don't expect a massive game. Achievements &amp; leaderboards add some replayability.  This does  NOT  have micro-transactions. Previous versions on the mobile version had them, but they were since removed.  The only feature I would like to see added is co-op mode.  Also Halo 3.",

            "review_text": "I'd say that this was a good run. It really made me spend some hours into this game, especially as a Halo fan.  Halo: Spartan Assault is a Top-Down Shooter that is a 'prequel?' to Halo: Spartan Strike, and as noticed by the gameplay, it is significantly different from all the other Halo First Person Shooters you all know in love. But it is still considered a Halo game in my standards and it definitely deserves some recognition.  As with the story, you play as the characters that are seen in Halo 4, Spartan Palmer and Spartan Davis. As it takes place before the events of Halo 4, you're met with a series of missions in each specific Operation. There are 5 missions in each Operation and there are a total of 6 Operations altogether. Depending on your pacing of the game, it may take you less than a day up to a couple of days at the most to complete this game, depending if you're getting the achievements or not.  Lots of things return from the previous Halo games along with other stuff that are non-existant in Halo: Spartan Assault. One of the most famous things to return is the Armor Abilities. Along with the previous ones returning such as the Active Camoflage, the Autosentry, and Sprint also returns as an Armor Ability. Besides the old ones, there are new Armor Abilities that can be very effective and sometimes overpowered. The Overshield is one of the most overpowered Armor Abilites you can have in the game.  Some of the beloved vehicles return from Halo Wars as well. The Grizzly is the only vehicle from Halo Wars that is drivable, the others like the Hawk, Wolverine, and even the Elephant are just there for asthetics.    No Battle Rifle or some other fan loved weapons don't exist. :(    In my opinion, Halo: Spartan Assault had more replayablility than it did on Halo: Spartan Strike. Even after you finish the game, you still had to do some of the Spartan Ops that are available in every mission, but the only difference is that the Spartan Ops in Spartan Assault made you do more work than in Spartan Strike, sometimes having you to replay that mission more than once and making it tedious just to complete that specific Spartan Op. But after completing them all and earning all the achievements, it really does make you feel like you've achieved something after all that hours you put into (That is, if you're planning to do that).  Probably the only bad parts of this game are the sometimes tedious Spartan Ops and no multiplayer for this version. Since only the Xbox 360 and Xbox One versions have multiplayer, it should be fair that the PC version should get multiplayer as well in my opinion.  $5 is worth it in my opinion and it's $1 cheaper than Halo: Spartan Strike, so you're basically geting more bang for your buck for this game. I know the gameplay isn't everybody's cup of tea, but you should still try this, Halo fan or not. If you're not convinced, then this game contains trading cards and Halo theme backgrounds and emoticons that some or most Halo fans want (Including myself).  In conclusion, Halo: Spartan Assault is a very decent Top-Down Shooter as it stands for most Halo fans and everyone else to try.   Should you buy this game?",

            "review_text": "Finally a Halo title on Steam... Albeit the crummiest, most god-forsaken half ♥♥♥ release of the franchise I cannot bring myself to call it a bad game. It may just be my devotion to the series and being a huge, life-long fan of the universe that is fogging up my glasses of reasoning, or it may be the atmosphere the game immediately creates with the un-mistakable sound track. Either way, I’m pretty damn happy with the $5.00 I spent acquiring this fairly respectable game. Whilst in no way does it do the franchise any justification or could even sit amongst the many flawless titles that have been released over the last 14 years, I’m happy to have it in my steam library and I’m pleased by the trading card support that includes some great art-work which keeps the universe alive and cements its place on the PC platform. I sincerely hope the cement is not the tombstone of it here and that now Microsoft, the owners of the series will publish other great titles onto Steam. Wishful thinking, I know. But there is plenty of reasoning to suggest it could happen.  The game it’s self is obviously one created for a sub-pc platform, phones, tablets etc. It does feel like a lame implementation of something that wasn’t made for Pc however holds a decent arcade element and has some okay level content. The missions are a bit short and lack anything to get your teeth sunk into but again it must be remembered that this game was likely something people would play on the train to work.   At the end of the day, if you enjoy the Halo series you will buy it because it is only $5 and gives you some nostalgia. I just hope it is not for that reason Microsoft have released it to lure PC players back to the console and boost Xbone sales or plug a new Halo game. As much as I want to relive it all and embrace a new title, my console days are over – I’ve made my bed and I will do as my father always told me – lay in it.  ",

Feels like it was meant to be played with a controller, considering how clunky vehicle movement feels on a mouse and keyboard, but is way too fast paced to be viable. The game does little in the way of difficulty outside of skulls, and unless you enable 4+ of them nothing really increases in difficulty. The two final levels of the campaign are probably the hardest regardless, but not in a way that feels fun, just completely overbearing. Story is fairly forgettable, although I did play the first chapter and the last five nearly a year apart.  I'd reccomend passing on this game unless it's on sale for $3 or less.  About 4 hours of gameplay, nothing too spectacular and so-so mission variety.",

You do everything the same way as in the normal halo games, just from a top down view, with a good background ost reminiscent of the halo series as well.  However what really got me enjoying this was the 'size' of the game, as I said earlier. You get the feeling that even though you are an important element of a war, you're not the only one. You see background battles often and you get that extra juice from it, at least I do.  For the price? a must buy.",

The graphics are your standard fare for top down, nothing to write home about here except the explosions and ice effects look pretty nice, Dont expect blood like in halo CE, it is very toned down, and looks nice, however I like my halo dripping in blue and purple goo.  Gameplay wise this is very much halo, top down! Firefights are varied and are pretty simple encounters. There are some base defense missions where you will be looking after a base or a helipad and waves of enemies come at you for about 5 minutes. They wont be throwing 1000's of enemies on screen or anything, but most of the game is follow the linear path, kill the baddies.  Sound is fantastic, it is so awesome to hear the gun sounds and covenant again! Sounds are damn near coming straight out of Halo 3, ODST, and Reach it seems like. Very pleasing to hear after all the years.  To go into this game wanting to marathon through it would be terrible because of how repetitive it is. This is a game you play for 30 minutes at a time, beat a few levels and get off or else you'll get bored. This is very much a game to go, well I got 20 minutes before whatever, I can beat a level or two in this before I leave the house.  8/10 GOOD HALO FIX TILL THE COLLECTION HITS THE PC!",

The game starts off a little easy, but quickly ramps up to a nice challenge.  All your favourite classic weapons are here, but they might not handle quite like you remember.

While it may not be the best of the Halos, it still has good things about it. The game has a pretty good story, and also brings alot of vehicles and weapons, such as the Grizzly, Hawk, Focus Rifle and dual SMGS, from previous Halos, rather than only having things from Halo 4, which I like. The gameplay is good for what it is. As for the graphics, the game, being developed mainly for phones then ported to PC and Xbox, doesn't have the best graphics, but that doesn't bother me. One thing I like is that they removed the microtransactions which were present on the phone version for the Steam release.

From the excellent campaign, the brilliant multiplayer and the revolutionary Forge, the fun never seemed to end. Thousands upon thousands of hours have been lost due to Custom Games alone, a true testament to a fantastic game. Friends would gather for hours on end to discover never-before-seen maps and game types and have an absolute fantastic time while doing so, inspiring some to make their own. Even at the age of 4 years old, Halo 3 still retained a large fan base of hundreds of thousands, something not many video games today can say. Friends and I alike adored the game and worshipped it for its seemingly never-ending fun.  But now, trouble has disrupted the balance. Thousands of players seek new homes in other video games, they seemingly prefer these new homes as they offer things no other video game does. They seem blind to the fact that Halo 3 is the holy grail of entertainment, and they ignore our pleas. But with your help, 343i, we can restore balance. Most past Halo 3 players reside in the lands of the Personal Computer now and regularly play their video games on Valve Software’s Steam. Halo 3 can find a new home here, a home with VAC protection, The Workshop and Steam Groups. I am not alone in this plight, for thousands of other Steam users beg of Halo 3 to spread its powerful wings on the Personal Computer. Please, 343i, let these fond memories become present excitements and release Halo 3 on Steam as soon as humanly possible.  Sincerely,  Mobert Ritchell ",

Halo 3, Reach, ODST, Halo 4, the part of Halo:CE I managed to play before my Xbox RROD'd, loved it. All of it.  You can imagine that I was quite pleased to see a halo title appearing on steam. I knew it was just a port from mobile, but I didn't give a ♥♥♥♥. A new Halo game. On PC. I bought it.  The game is not that great. I played through a few missions, and it's really obvious that it was made for mobile. Mechanics are simplistic, graphics are eh, story is eh. 'eh' summarizes my experience with Spartan Assault. It's a mediocre game which is quite forgettable, and at this point it would feel like a chore for me to finish it. I really wish this weren't the case. As said earlier, I love Halo, but the sole presence of 'Halo' in this game's title does not suffice to save this mobile, generic top-down shooter from being exactly what it sounds like: mediocre.  Would not recommend, and that makes me sad.",

No idea if the story is canon but it's your typical Halo fanfare, very reminiscent of Halo Reach in that it follows non-MC spartans. Gameplay is twin-stick, but with identical controls to what is in Halo (at least if you play with a gamepad), making it very easy to pick up, with most of the associated weapons, grenades, vehicles and powerups that are in Halo. I guess this is as good as you're going to get for now, since Halo proper isn't coming to PC any time soon, but that this game is definitely worth the price, even not on sale.  ",

            "review_text": "As a person who's first video game ever was Halo:CE on the original Xbox 12 years ago in 2001, I've spent the majority of my hours in my gaming lifetime playing inside the Halo series. I've clocked about 7K hours total in all the Halo games combined, and I'm extremely critical of anything Halo. Unlike most I won't say no just because this game is not an FPS, but I will look at it as a game in general. Halo Spartan Assualt is a simple top-down shooter that was literally made to pass the time when you are bored. This game does not have much depth to it, the story is based around past battles in the Universe and all the missions are 'simulations' as all the virtual walls surrounding your play area identify.  Graphics - For a $5 game that is also a mobile game, this game is beautiful. The ground textures look crisp, the animations are stellar, and it does a pretty good job of keeping your eyes glued to the game. The character models are fairly good, however the Grunts and Elites don't exactly look like their FPS counterparts in terms of color. Most of the Grunts are Yellow, and most of the Elites are Purple(Based on how far I've gotten in the game so far, will update once 100% done). This ticks me off because in the FPS versions, Grunts are Orange and Elites are Blue. On the lowest rankings that is. As of now there are no Red/Black/Camo Elites, but there are Gold Elites and White Grunts though, so that's a change.  Story - So far, there is little. The Story is based around the Covenant breaking the Treaty it has with the UNSC by invading Draetheus-V and it's moons. This game is set after the events of Halo 3, but prior to Halo 4. This is the answer as to why the UNSC and Covenant where fighting when Halo 4 began. I'll leave the small details to you. But on terms of levels, the levels are layed out as Operations, there are 5 Operations total, each having 6 Missions in them labeled as (Letter) - (Number) to keep this simple. In the beginning of each of those 5 Operations is a well done cut scene expalining the next bit of the story. They're rather short, but get the job done. There hasn't been any voice overs mid fight, or much explanation other than the caption in each Mission before you start playing(they are interesting to read if you know the Halo Universe through previous games/books). Those captions add new Characters we have not seen before, such as Spartan Davis. I'm disappointed in the story, but for a game like this that was not intended to be very story driven it is understandable.  Gameplay - Ah, the important question. I'm not gonna lie, the gameplay is damn fun for this genre. This game has a solid feeling of when you hit something and when you do not, enemies respond accordingly to hits, and won't just immediately walk into your wall of fire from the UNSC/Covenant Turrets. Gameplay is fast and responsive, and it makes getting Killionaires and other high multi-kill medals fairly easy. One gripe is that there are missions where you actually do specific tasks like destroying AA-Wraiths or Escorting Wolverines, but there are others that have you survive for a certain period of time and wait until your ride comes to pick you up. In the mean time of that they throw countless enemies at you just to try to give you some entertainment. It felt like the Deadpool game in those moments(even though it was for only 3-4 minutes).   Audio - I had to give this it's own segment, the audio in this game is amazeballs. It's really clear and great quality. But, they didn't keep all the original sounds from previous Halo games. The Shotgun sounds like something I've never heard before, and all the others sounds faintly similar to their FPS brothers. Obviously this is a different game, but it just didn't feel like Halo there.  Final Thoughts - For $5 this game really is pretty damn good. It's not the usual Halo experience(neither was Halo Wars but I enjoyed that game too) however it gave a great experience with a good bit of fun to be had. For this price, it's an easy buy for any Halo fan that wants another taste of the series.   8.5/10",

(Such as normal marines using ODST drop pods, and jackels throwing plasma grenades).  The controls don't make much sense either. (You can't edit the fire and grenade keys). Along with a delayed response sometimes.  Sometimes you have to fight hordes of enemies which leaves you in a fustrating situation. And at times leaving you with not enough enemies and with a turret that fires 100 bullets per second. The game is difficult.

Just a heads up for controller users.. Don't.. Controller aiming is just terrible.. Make sure you use a keyboard and mouse. PC version is definitely the best version. I just wish I could log into my XboxLive account with the steam version, like I do with all the other versions of the game.  There is NO Co-op flood game mode in the PC version. I believe that is only for Xbox users.  Overall, I recommend this game because it is very cheap, and you will get your moneys worth. Having a Halo game on steam also makes me hopeful for the future with other Halo titles.",

Use your Armor Ability to help yourself in combat, and then run. That's pretty much it. They did a good job at translating the Halo controls into a lesser version of the games. The story is just fluff from what I've seen. It's basically 'you're running simulations on your tablet of UNSC battles, to train your mind for future UNSC battles.' Way to make it obvious that it wasn't meant for computers, right?  The game has an achievement system built into it, which is really nice, and has weekly challenges to complete for bonus experience, so that's pretty neat.

I haven't tried this on a tablet, and I wouldn't suggest try playing it with a keyboard and mouse if you have a gamepad lying around. Even with a gamepad, the controls are still pretty clunky. Using the analog sticks to control, even in a consistently turning circle was difficult, let alone trying to focus fire on a single target.  The last significantly discouraging thing about playing this game is that for each missiong you're given a set primary and secondary weapon. You can buy a misison only weapon upgrade to either the USNC sniper rifle, Spartan Laser, or the rocket launcher, otherwise the you need to scavenge for the few different weapon types that are dropped from fallen enemies.  While it's another arc in the Halo series, the overall narration left much to be delivered in plot and atmospheric feel of the game of fellow soldiers shouting out commands, whether they're USNC or Covenant.

The actual shooting feels nice, the combat borrows heavily from standard Halo, transferring the usual tropes of the series inside the twin stick shooter genre almost flawlessly; the missions begin to repeat themselves a little too much after a while, and I'd have preferred more 'traveling' missions and less timed stuff or escort stuff, however all in all there's a good variety, besides the game's not too long, so it doesn't get boring.",

The missions are not that long, but they are enjoyable and the XP system is a very interesting one. For each mission, you can select kit that is used throughout the game. This includes perks, guns and the like. You can also add XP boosters, which boost your XP but make the game harder. For example, you can equip them 'only spartan has a shield' option. This means once the shield is gone, your dead, no health.   Good points  -Very cheap (£1.50 for me)  -Replayability - in the form of bronze, silver or gold stars awarded for each mission based off points scored  -Simple but pleasing graphics  -Some nice story and video   Bad points  -Scale - I don't like the scale of the game. I feel like they game is locking me to a rubbish FOV. I'd like to see more of the area within the map.  -XP - while the XP system is good, you may have to play the mission several types to be able to afford good equipment to get the higher scores   Nothing else to really say. If you find this game for cheap like I did, then I say go for it. It's probably going to take you around 2-4 hours to complete, but it's got a deacent replayability to it and it's nice just running around in the 3rd person blowing stuff up.

You WILL be disappointed if you expect an Xbox or PC quality type of game. Halo: Spartan Assault also has nothing to do with Halo 4. Did people really expect an AAA quality game for $5 ?  What do I think of it ?  It's a pretty damn well polished game for a mobile game. It feels like a Halo game. Driving the Scorpion feels like driving the Scorpion from the console series. The port to PC is almost flawless. It's not a cheap-♥♥♥ port like Microsoft did for Halo 2, they actually took the time to make it playable with a mouse and keyboard. My only issue is that after an hour playing it, even my desktop struggle to make the game run smoothly. Memory leak ?  I'd say Halo: Spartan Assault is pretty successful. Of course the graphics are not that great, of course it's not the FPS we expected. But it actually has a story that fits within the Halo universe, it's playable, it's entertaining, it feels like Halo and it is Halo.  The cons ? After a while playing it, the game tends to get a bit laggy. It IS a mobile game, it is short and does not have high quality graphics. A couple of missions are a bit repetitive (survive for x minutes while we toss infinite waves at your face), it's fun at the beginning but does not really make you want to play it again and again.  The pros ? The price. It's Halo. It's one of the very rare mobile game with an actual story to it. Even for a mobile game, the graphics are pretty damn good. Hopefully this is a test from Microsoft to see if they should release an actual Halo game, and hopefully it works.  I think this game is pretty successful and people who are into the Halo series should at least give it a try. It's only $5.  Kudos to the devs, they did a great job. 9/10.",

Going away from the first person aspect that made the console shooters genre defining, this venture is a top down, twin stick affair. The question is however, as this is the first Halo game on PC since Halo 2 and Spartan Assault started life on phones, is it any good?  There are lots of twin sticks available but this is the first one I have really enjoyed. Halo is known for its deep storytelling universe and these missions come in at about 5 minutes each and so the story is told in text and short chapter cutscenes leaving the story feeling a bit Spartan ( har har oh god the puns ). Well they are not stricly cut scenes more voice over animated images. They still get the job done in setting up the story.   The AI in the game is were this game is made. Halo's enemies have very specific tactics, elites roll away and charge on shield depletion, grunts run away if elites are killed ( without the funny screaming I may add ) jackals box you in using shields as protection on other enemies and brutes just kill everything in their path. And for the most part this has been included into Spartan Assault making it feel like you really are playing a proper Halo title. The bugs are back floating about, expect from a top perspective they are much easier to deal with that in a first person context which is a relief.  Soundwise this feels very much like Halo, from the thud of the magnum to whail of the wraiths cannon the weapons sound exactly the same. The in game music however has a different story. Most of the music is the choral stuff, mostly known from title screens and story telling cutscenes and feels somewhat out of place when your charging across the field with a fleet of tanks, when the music in previous games has some very action paced 'heavier' tracks and they could have been included in Spartan Assault and weren't.   And the games graphics are they any good? Well ... kind of. The games graphic menu consists of resolution, vsync and anti aliasing, and the entire game is surrounded by an odd bright blue line... this border isn't so bad its more that the top left coner and bottom right have diagonal cuts. Its a very colourful game. but then halo has always had that going for it. Its a stark contrast between the greens and purples of the Covenant and the more brownish / mute colours of the UNSC. The game is certainly eye catching with every bullet, laser and plasma bolt having a nice trail.  Final Verdict: Halo: Spartan Assault is deffinatly worth picking up if you are a fan of the Halo universe. If you are not then you may be confused by the non existant identification of the large range of enemy types and whether that weapon is worth using. Though for £3.99 or your regional equivilant this is a solid purchase with easy drop in times or for a longer experience. A good quality port with both good keyboard and mouse response and solid controller layouts. All in all this game is worth your time.",

But the series has as many flops as it has hits and Spartan Assault definitely falls into the former category. A top-down shooter, Spartan Assault lacks in variety and excitement. There just aren't enough weapons, levels, monsters or objectives, and the game very quickly becomes boring and repetitious. Far too many missions depend on keeping fragile NPCs alive, despite their having an intelligence that compares poorly to a flame-loving moth. I suppose one excuse for the game's poor showing is that it is, after all, nothing more than a downloadable arcade game, but seeing as other downloadable titles manage to offer far more fulfilling experiences, this excuse holds little weight. Three minutes into the first mission and I had seen pretty much all the game has to offer; ten minutes in and I was wondering if I should just write off my $5 and find something else to play, and three hours later - when I finally completed the last aggravating mission - I wondered why I had wasted so much time on such an awful game.",

I was hoping more for the latter, but would be fine with fine even with the tactical focus. Soon after I started playing I realized I was given none of those. Instead, it' somewhere in the middle, with no redeeming elements of either.  Halo: Spartan Assault is a game without a interesting story, that isn't action packed, it fails to be tactical and is outright boring to play, unless you are not too picky about your games and don't expect anything special from this. It's not even challenging at that, However it does feel repetitive (even with the different objectives) and the combat feels like a chore.

The game in itself, the back story, the history of your main character. Just the whole thing. I even guessed that the humans were or interacted with the forerunners in 2003 (not hard since 343 recognized our species). I've even read 2 of their many books. I've owned and played every Halo game even the somewhat lame ones (Halo ODST &amp; Halo Wars, not bad games just nothing compared to the rest). I was very happy to find Halo Spartan Assault on Steam. If you're a fan like me then this game is a must have and since it's only $4.99 there's no real reason not to get it. I traded a game for it, a game I earned for free so even if you don't have money this is still obtainable. I like top down shooters and this one runs incredibly smooth. The story takes place in between Halo 3 and 4 and focuses on the newer batch of Spartan II's. The game is a challenge if you try to obtain gold for every level and there are over 30 levels.  You play one of 2 Spartans back and forth as you complete missions. You only control your character but I think that's part of the fun (more like Halo 1-4 except not FPS). Board any vehicle and take your pick from nearly all of the UNST and Covenant weapons we've come to know in the previous games.  This isn't a long game and the replay value is moderate if you're a fan, but its a great arcade style of game play. Not complex and easy to learn.  If you're not a fan but you're looking to spend $5 on a decent game this is a good choice and it has trading cards that are selling in the Steam marketplace for a good amount at the moment compared to other cards.  If you're a fan then this game is a must have. Great visuals and more Covenant domination at the hands of the Spartan II's. My only wish is that they made the game longer but for the price and the style of game that it is the length of the game isn't a surprise. Also even if they made the game with 100 levels I'd probably still want more... :)",
