    "description": "Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II pits three teams against each other in a struggle for wealth, power and total domination. Whether using the Gunpowder Keg to clear out a territory full of enemies, or the Javelin to pin your dead foes to a wall, you'll find this game both hilarious and exhilarating.",

            "review_text": "Swords, axes, crossbows, and rifles. You have three classic teams of old times, Pirates, Vikings, and Knights. The Pirates have their speedy skirmishers, tough captains, and a gun-happy sharpshooter. The Vikings have their insane yet fast berserkers, the powerfully defensive huscarl with his two handed axe and shield, and the gestir that pokes people with a spear. The Knights have your standard archer with both a longbow and a crossbow that's not quite so strong but is very quick, and they also have the heavy knight with his two handed sword can take out most enemies in just two or three hits.  This is a great game for up close melee, but you do have to deal with the ranged classes and they can be very annoying from afar. But with your speedy sword swinging teammates, taking them down can be very easy depending on who you're fighting. Sure you have people that love to run away, and that's when it's best to have a ranged weapon to take them out from afar when they have their back turned trying desperately to run away from you.   It's a great, fun, and crazy online game to play. It takes a while to master your sword swinging, parrying, and gunslinging, but it's well worth it when you're finally able to take down those really tough opponents. It's an all around enjoyable game that's not without its flaws, but still a great game especially for free. If you have the time to download it, I say get it. I rate this game a 7.5/10. Sure I want to rate it a 9/10, but I do recognize some of the game mechanics flaws particularly in balancing the three teams. Still I definitely recommend this game!",

Or the upper hand in a trinket wars, which is mutated team death match (great maps in this mode! trap ridden aztec temples, nordic strongholds etc). But, what really makes PVKII a must try, are the unique melee combat mechanics. You can block in 4 different directions, attack in 4 different directions and accumulate hitting power by holding down the attack button. Then there are class based special abilities, which can be used after dealing enough damage. Such as a two handed whirlwind attack, a bomb firing blunderbuss, or just berserker rage.  Adding the overall humorous scenario and custom made radio messages (they are just a blast!), PVK II is a great ride of fun. You like melee combat, or combating melee classes (no one likes archers though, especially with friendly fire on)? This game is for free! Get in there and join the killing spree.",

It's still probably pretty terrible, though.). Having a thick skin is highly recommended.  While the game currently has a lot classes and features planned for it, the developers are developing the game at a snail's pace. However, what's already in-game offers plenty of entertainment for those with a taste for competitive melee. Or throwing axes. Or parrots.  Yes, parrots are weapons.",

Much like Super Smash Bros or Goldeneye64, this game has potential for lots of fun and laughs amongst a group of friends. Each team of Vikings, pirates and knights has 3 classes that mix up gameplay and offer somehting for everyone. The game is jammed full of funny action phrases and achievements. The players you find on this game will be a lot of fun to play with. For a free game, this offers a fun experience and alternative to your whacky action multiplayers.  Hit boxes, class balance and weapon damage are a total headache though(ruining the longevity for competitive players when the novelty wears off), so keep in mind it may not be for everyone. In my opinion it was worth the try and fun to play for a little bit.",

Seriously though; this mod differs greatly from most other strange and wacky mods in that it actually delivers a solid gameplay experience. It's not asymmetrical in any way that you'd likely expect - rather, it goes for a system based off of each team's classes playing off each other. Which is interesting in itself, given how classes are still being implemented into the game. Anyways, yeah; with a unique approach to first person melee combat that I find even more satisfying than games such as Chivalry, and a solid class system that manages to be both balanced and chaotic at the same time, this mod has managed to become one of my favorite mods of all time.   If a PVKIII were to be developed for a modern engine such as Unreal 4, I have a feeling that it'd see a good deal of popularity.",
