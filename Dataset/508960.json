The task is simple – just bring the cube to the final destination… However, that’s not that simple as it seems! Some of the obstacles can change, size, shape and even behavior of your cube!",

It's WAY too easy 2. and glitchy  I've played it with a controller (you still need the keyboard then) and was able to move through the walls with the blocks in levels where you have to controll two of them. This bug doesn't seem possible while playing with the keyboard, but it bothers me a little bit, that the blocks don't have to be on their goal. It's enough when they have at least touched it.  So, is it worth the price or not? Well, if you want to have some fun for a few minutes and want to support a small team of developers, then why not. Would they add more levels with higher difficulties and maybe some more puzzles, fix the bugs, then it would be a good game.",

On some levels will be first to eat up blocks each other, and last to roll to the exit. If there is one more block on levels, then commuted on a management each by numbers 1 and 2.  An interface in a game is a very minimalism. In a game 35 easy enough levels that is passed very quickly. Estimation: 6/10",
