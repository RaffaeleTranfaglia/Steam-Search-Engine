            "review_text": "I would have hoped for this puzzle game to be a bit more... puzzly. Most puzzle games that I enjoy require some kind of insight to proceed, or at least, are designed such that strategic thinking is superior to trial and error. You apply logic, derive a pattern and act on it.  This game on the other hand does not reward thinking much. The best strategy seems to be: Find pieces that fit the border (usually this will yield a unique partial solution) and go from there (usually there is a unique way to do so). This took me through the hundred levels in roughly six hours with little cause to reconsider my strategy. It's not super boring (you can listen to music or podcasts in the background) but does not provide an interesting challenge either.  I would have hoped for more clever puzzles. There are topological and graph theoretic insights that levels could be built upon, such as:  • Any cut through the level crosses an even number of lines (of each colour). • The curvature of each loop must sum up to a multiple of 360°. • If there are crossings between red and blue lines, then this number of crossings must be even. • The number of times line segments connect to the left end of a hexagon equals the number of times that a connects to the right (for each colour. the same for the other two directions).  I think it would have been possible to build new mechanics and levels around those mechanics that encourage and reward thinking about these things. Sadly, the existing levels are designed such that considerations of this kind are either useless or more tedious than just applying trial and error.  There are puzzle games out there that convey interesting logical insights and reward the application of them, making the player feel smart when solving a challenge. This is not one of these games.",

A lot of previous comments about acheivements but ultimately if it chills you out and you enjoy it to the point you can zone out I dont see an issue why you would need to know where you are at. Its immersive and simple (in a complex way?!), I think keeping it that way is fine. Thanks for making this Im thoroughly enjoying it.",
