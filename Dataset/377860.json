            "review_text": "One of my all time favorite Bullet-Hell/Shoot 'em up games ever is finally on Steam.  The fun of this game comes not only from how well crafted the graphics, sound, bullet patterns, enemy types, etc all are, but also from how simple but elegant the scoring systems are. If you keep playing you WILL keep getting better, and you WILL keep getting higher scores. The game has multiple game modes, each with their own quirks, scoring systems, and differing mechanics. Not only do you have Arcade mode, but you also have Novice mode and Arrange mode. And then each of those has Original, Maniac, and Ultra modes, which differ in more ways than just difficulty.  There's also guaranteed to be unlimited challenge as far as the difficulty is concerned. Novice Original is easy enough that people who've never picked up a game like this can 1 credit clear, while Novice Ultra provides for a great time for new players but still has that 'holy crap I can't believe I just survived that' feel to it. Then on the other end of the spectrum is Arcade Ultra, which is damned near impossible, you have unlimited credits which is an awesome feature but the challenge of course is to finish each mode with no credits or as less credits as possible and set a new high score.  + Great and varied modes and difficulty settings to suit your skill level + Great Soundtrack + Infinite continues + Graphics and art style  P.S. the game at launch had a few problems like crashing and not running at all for some like me but now its fixed and runs fine.",

            "review_text": "CAVE's first appearance on Steam was received positively and made many people child-happy, myself included.   The port is very good, although it has some   bugs  , which aren't game-breaking as far as I know. It has 4 game modes to choose from, one of them being a DLC and each of them offers a different experience, which makes the game accessible to everyone (from complete beginners to superplayers).  Gameplay is solid and scoring can get fun, if you get deep into its mechanics. What I like about this game is that the movement is fluid, responsive and the tiny hitbox makes it possible to dodge various masses of bullets with ease if you know what are you doing. Music is good and the graphics are beautiful due to their crispness. Also, it offers customization for ex. screen display, background image, input display, detailed score ...  The only downside I can think of is the music for Arrange mode because it has little resemblance to the original one and i don't like its style.   Otherwise, it's a great game and CAVE and Degica did a good job at bringing it to Steam. I hope we see more of it.",

            "review_text": "Mushihimesama or known also as (Bug Princess) is a Arcade game originally released in 2004 from Cave Interactive only available in Japan. But thanks to the company Degica Games they have finally decided to bring this true gem of a Bullet Hell to the PC Steam Market.   The Story of the game is about A world of wild insects roaming the lands who are capable of surviving due to rock hard shells. When eventually dying they leave behind vegetation that grows around them in a Great Circle of Life style (Living and then dying as a nature tale.) Due to them being poisonous though humans were not all able to survive infact needing to sacrifice every 200 years a 15 year old girl. Reco the next girl in line and one of the Royal family members of the last remaining village is the next to perish on the day of her 15th birthday who decides to save her people by embarking on a quest to meet the God of the Insects known as the Koujuu.  Gameplay: This game is a complete arcade port of the original game offering a variety of different gameplay features ranging from Novice, Normal, Arrange, and Version 1.5 (One of the hardest modes to tackle)  The Game features Controller and Keyboard support but also lack no 1080p display sadly as of (up till writing this review)  Other than a few small glitches at first start up this game is a complete powerhouse packed with content and tons of replayability and if you are a fan of Bullet Hell, Space Shooting, or Shmup games I think you will find your enjoyment in Mushihimesama.  Included is my First Impression of the game I hope you enjoyed and felt my review to be the worthy one in involving your purchase for Mushhimesama.

            "review_text": "This is a really good port of one of CAVES best shooters. It's one of the more approachable bullet hell games they've made so it makes sense this would be the first one they bring over to get people interested over the arguably more difficult Dodonpachi Series. Unlike other bullethell shooters, CAVE games don't rely on rote memorization to do well; They have a nice blend of freeform movement and tight bullet dodging which doesn't feel gimmicky or cheap. If you're experienced in the genre or have good reflexes then even you can make it far on your first playthrough.  *The controls are as tight as they always were and every death will be your fault (no blaming th controls here :P)  *The game comes with 3 game modes (4 if you get the 1.5 DLC) each with 3 difficulty levels to control exactly how hard you want your experience to be. You have Novice, Original, Arranged, and 1.5 (aka Matsuri). Each has their own soundtrack which you can mix and match with other modes in the game in the options. It's really customizable.   *The visuals are really crisp and good looking. It's only in 720p, but it doesn't take away from the art direction and the cleaness of everything presented. The menu is very slick and easy to navigate. You won't be entering and exiting a lot of menues to switch modes or play with options for each game.  *The framerate is great at least for me. It switches between 59-60 fps during gameplay but I've never visually noticed or felt it. The main menu where you select which mode you want to play is 30fps but once you choose a mode it changes to 60. There is slowdown during the game but IT'S 100% INTENTIONAL. Cave's games have what's known as 'earned' slowdown. The game will LOOK like it's slowing down but if you look at your FPS counter it should still be +/-1 fps from 60 at all times during gameplay. This is written 2 days after launch of the game but there have been framerate complaints from some people saying the game goes as low as 54fps for them. I have a pretty basic non-gaming laptop and it runs fine for me. I suspect it's some graphics card issue or they're running other programs in the background which might cause it to slow down.  All in all, if you are a veteran or a newbie trying to get into the genre then you can't go wrong with this quality title.",

If you are a new player on this genre, and you think you can beat this game at maximum difficulty, then...buy this game.

So good that i don't care dying over and over again, i just want to listen the music one more credit. And the 1.5 DLC adds more music. Thanks Cave, my ears are really satisfied.  The port (because this is a port) is really, really good. Damn, everything in this game is good. Or not? Well, let me see it again....20$? Really? (15$ in week release) I think is worth, but a bit expensive. If you are a fan of this genre, then buy it without hesitation  Pros:  -Top tier soundtrack -So frustating...I like it -Novice mode (yup, Steam has casuals too) -Really good port   Cons:  -20$ (hey come on, the Master Race is not rich enough) -A crash in the begining of the game?

The game feels good, the graphics are nice, explosions and sound makes feel you good to shoot enemies.    - Not that good: I myself experience a lot of slowdowns, even with a GTX 970 and a Xeon 1230v3. I don't know if this is normal in the original game too or other ports.  I don't like that only part of the screen is used for the game itself. I understand the original game and there is probably no way than rotating my screen to get it filled. So this is not a really minus point, it just bugs me.

I've had other games from them on my 360, but now I can finally enjoy this game without having to play it on an Apple product on the big screen.  Day one--there are a couple bugs I've noticed. The option screen from the main game portal got weird on the edges when I finished up a game in Arranged mode, and cycled back to the opening. Also, I've noticed once or twice that the gameplay will stop for a tenth of a second or so, almost like the game did a small upload. These things don't stop the fact that Mushihimesama is good. Really good. One of the best bullet hell shooters good.  If you like the genre, you should've already downlaoded this by now. If you don't, buy it when it's on sale and enjoy!

            "review_text": "Let's be honest here. All of my friends know me as a bullet hell fanatic. When my friends told me that Jamestown was awesome, I played through that so much, I almost got burnt out. In fact, I did.  I haven't played 'You know what' in years and I felt kinda rusty...  And then I decided to reinstall Steam because certain other games caught my eye and what did I find when I came home from work today...  ....CAAAAAAAAVE.  I don't own any iteration of XBox, nor an iPhone/Pad. I've never known the joys of DoDonpachi or Espgaluda. I've wanted to play a CAVE game SOOOOOO bad for years now, and I've finally gotten the chance.  Going into the game, I could honestly find little faults. To be fair, its because this laptop is fairly old, so I'm used to playing on lower resolutions to save framerate. Not that it means anything. I know CAVE has intentional framerate slows at points so the game isn't TOO hard when you're staring at an almost filled ellipse of purple death. In either case, if you're familiar with cave, you know the bullet patterns are always fair, no matter how harsh they may seem. Always remember that the bullet size isn't indicative of its own hitbox, and if you learn their hitboxes, you'll get the hang of dodging relatively quickly. Novice is well, novice. There's more breaks in patterns, some stage enemies don't fire at all anymore, etc. Its great for beginners. Standard is exactly what it says. Play Maniac on standard or above for a fun time. (If you're new you might even experience the rare occurance of smashing a keyboard/controller in frustration! But that's part of the learning process.)  In short, if you've heard of CAVE, buy this game. If you like bullet hell games, buy this game.  No seriously, buy it. Probably the best $14.99 (soon to be $19.99) you'll have spent in a good long while. Plus it hopefully will convince CAVE to release Ketsui and DoDonpachi on Steam as well!",

Eschatos brings the old school style mixed impeccably with modern design expertise (And subtlety, how rare in this genre.), Ikaruga brings Treasure's take, CrimzonClover takes us on a wild roller coaster ride on a V2 missile that explodes gloriously, Exceed 3rd puts us somewhere south of Touhou, north of Cave, and even Sine Mora shows you what terrible shmups are like.  So where does that leave Cave?  We all already know. Their flavor of shmup is balls to the wall, sensory overload. Loads of quick bullets in lovely patterns, undeniably lovely environments and bosses before and after they are charred with your bullets. This is twitch gaming at its purest.  The port is lovely, runs beautifully, with all manner of options, but I have to bow to a true enthusiast to give a definitive answer.  But the game itself? Classic Cave shooting action without some of the esoteric nonsense scoring of their later years.

Try playing this with headphones...the soundtrack will blow you away though you may want to buy the soundtrack to listen to separately as it can be hard to focus on the music with so much happening on the screen! My 2 gripes about this game are that the resolution options are not that great and that there is no explanation of the scoring, power-up items, or story in-game. I would have at least liked some info to cover what a typical arcade pop might have, which would include what different icons mean and explanation of the shot types. For the resolution issue, at least you can get the playfield the size you want it by adjusting the zoom, position, and zoom of the x and y axis separately, though it's hard to tell if you are playing on an arcade-accurate size ratio at that point. Also, this must be done after choosing your mode, so you will need to set this 4 times (3 if you don't buy the DLC...but buy it).

            "review_text": "While it is great to see Cave release their games on the PC platform, their first release leaves a little bit be desired when it comes to options.  I'll get it out of the way right away, this is a port of the XBOX 360 version and not much was really changed from that port. That means no graphic options and the game is stuck at 1280x720 and the game suffers from some vertical tearing due to lack of V-Sync. Other than that, the controls can be fully rebound on Keyboard an controllers.  Now, the game itself its pretty fun. If you do not know, Mushihimesama is what people would call a ''bullet hell'' due to amount of bullets on the screen at once. You play through 5 stages and face the final (and a secret-final boss if you meet the requirements) and that's it... Or is it?! Actually, no! Mushihimesama does offer enough content for both beginners and experts of the genre in order to provide them the most out of the game.  First of all, you have several modes of play which includes a novice modes for newcomers, the original game with the three main difficulty settings, an arrange mode focused on high scoring and lastly a DLC 1.5 revision of the game which changes the way some of mechanics of the game work out too. If you think you need to practice a stage or a boss, you can always chose your mode (Except novice for some reasons) then play the section you want until you master.  At its core, the gameplay of Mushihimesama consist of shooting down enemies and bosses while avoiding a big amount of bullets on-screen as mentioned previously. While it may seem overwhelming at first, you'll notice that your player's hitbox is a very small blue dot that appears when doing a ''focused'' attack. The scoring sysem does vary depending on the mode you chose and if you are interested in learning more about it, I suggest looking up scoring guides on steam. They are very helpful and teach you how it all works.  Now do I have some issues with the game other than the poor PC options and screen tearing? Yes, I do.  One thing the game could do it better label the prompts in the menues and what the button imputs do on the option screen when rebinding them. It took me some time before finding out that the two fire buttons it gives you do different things, since it was never labeled. No instruction manual is provided with the game either as far as I know.  A second problem is the arcade emulation. To a veteran, this is going to sound like a weird complaint because that's usually a good thing if the game is true to the arcade original. The problem with Cave's games is the slowdown when the screen is cluttered. The game constantly speeds down and speeds up when it gets hectic and I've personally never liked that in a game as it usually becomes incredibly distracting and tends to get me killed during the phases due to the controls slowing up and down all the time. I enjoy games that never slow down and I can't get for the life of me why an option to remove them was not added. Some arcade ports (Like the fantastic Gradius Collections on the PSP system) added a way to remove hardware slow down and the overall experience is, in my opinion, better.  Though the game's biggest issue is hat it has to save CONSTANTLY. Here's how often it does it; It saves when you chose a game mode. It saves when you quit training mode to get back into the training settings. It saves when you change the options (fair enough). It saves when the game is over. It saves when you go back to the main menu. It gets irritating really quickly because you just want to get back to the previous menu without interuptions, and those 5 seconds it takes to save every single time you do something adds up. I don't have any other games that saves as often as this one and it again shows this is a rather poor PC port in terms of technical fidelity.  Overall, is Mushihimesama worth its asking price. Personally, I think 20$ is a bit much considering there are cheaper offerings that are as good as this game and I find releasing the V1.5 mode as DLC on day 1 to be of poor taste considering this game is old, very old in fact. If it was 20$ for the whole package (including the soundtrack) this would be an absolute positive recommendation from me. As of now, I can recommend this game to people who don't mind the retail price and would like to either get into the genre or for veterans who never played this game. It's a pretty fun game. Or you can always wait for a sale, but that's up to you.",

A very nice touch is the 'novice' mode that is more similar to ordinary shmups.   I use a Hori fight stick mini to play and it gives me total control.   I can't recommend this game enough if you are after a challenging shmup. It's fun even for total novices like myself.",
