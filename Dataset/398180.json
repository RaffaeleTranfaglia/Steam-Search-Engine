            "review_text": "[TL;DR: An OK experience with good ideas, which is limited in gameplay, and is unfortunately crippled without a VR headset.]  Unless you have a VR headset of your own (and most people don't) I would not get this. This game really does seem like it would work best with the VR headset and was designed with it at it's center. But beyond that, there is very little to gameplay (more on that in paragraph three).  So, it does look quite nice, and I like the design of the monsters and the overall artstyle. The opening scene/menu was really striking and beautiful (it sets a mood for sure), and I would like to see more of a full game with this kind of look and feel.  The gameplay consists simply of falling at a snail's pace down into an abyss. You can slowly drift around as you do so, with the goal being to avoid the monsters and obsticles in your way. This simple gameplay it does pretty well, and I found it challenging. Yet there is absolutely nothing else to that beyond that. I got to level 5 of 9 as of writing this, and that took me about 30 minutes, so that should also be taken into consideration.   I feel I made a mistake in buying this seeing as I don't have a VR headset and the main selling ponit of this game is, quite frankly, VR. They really, truely, need to emphasize that this game was built as a VR experience. Sure, you can play it without, but it is a fraction of the intended experience.   I won't use Steams refund here because the game is functional, runs smoothly, and it accomplishes what it set out to do. At four dollars it is also not a huge investment. But I did not find it particularly enjoyable and I do regret getting it myself. But again, with a VR headset it think it would be a much improved experience.",

Don't be hesitant though, if you're a fan of spooky, dread-inducing ominous landscapes or want to be pulled into the mariana trench by THON DARKE FORSES  The looking down perspective causes a little bit of neck pain, but it's a great way to full immerse you; Most VR content will be concerned with up, and therefore your feet will be planted on some boring ground textures. Not so in Euclidean.  The only cons were with understanding exactly what it is you're doing, but it only took me 2 tries to understand that the rocks hurt and so do the little grabby anenomie enemies. and that squeezing the trigger=you don't get hit by the pokey things  ",

            "review_text": "First of all, I am a huge H.P. Lovecraft fan. I was excited about this game because it looked good and I had read reviews which said it was 'Lovecraftian levels of scary.' But when I started playing it, it didn't take me long to realize that this game wasn't scary whatsoever. All it is is a bunch of random shapes fly around as you fall through them. There is a narrator who recites vaguely Lovecraftian themes. And you die and you die over and over again because you have little to no control over where you fall through the shapes. So they just constantly kill you and it gets incredibly frusterating. That is it. that is the whole game. There is just nothing here. Seriously, you fall very slowly and cannot speed up nor can you move out of the way with any speed at all. The gameplay is pointless. On top of all that, it is just not scary at all. If you see a review of this game that claims this game is scary in any way or that it is good, they are either trolling or they are friends of the developer.   Do not get this game. It is not worth it. This game looks cool, but that is the only thing going for it. Do not fall for the boarderline false advertising. It is not 'Lovecraftian levels of scary' There are much better Lovecraft games out there, like the Darkness Within series.",

All I have to say is the thoughts 'What was that???' , followed by 'I don't want to know.'",

I fully endorse anyone interested in the game just get it. Be ready to be forced to figure things out on your own, but when you do the short experience will be totally great.",

The Good  With a VR headset, I bet this game looks pretty damned cool. However, as I myself don’t have a VR headset, this is only a speculative observation.  The Bad  I really feel like the word “Lovecraftian” gets thrown around a lot these days. When it becomes associated with sub-par games, it cheapens the word for the rest of the awesome games out that are great examples of Lovecraftian themes. Sadly, this game doesn’t do the word justice.  You know all the endless running apps on your phone? Temple Run and that sort of stuff? Imagine that, only vertically oriented and painfully slow. Voila! You have the gameplay of Euclidean.  The Meh  I feel like you almost need to have a VR headset to make this game worth the time and effort it takes to play it. If I had been the developer, I would have made the game require a VR headset and let it sit in the Steam Store with the rest of the gimmicky VR games.  Verdict: Nay  If you’re a fan of Lovecraftian games, this isn’t the game for you. If you’re a fan of endless running/falling games, you need to get better hobbies and raise your ambitions. If you have a VR headset, I’d only play this one if you could get for free. Your money could be better spent in other ways.",
