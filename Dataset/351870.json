I run a forum of this game where we did a lot of mods and a shame that it is not we have added this game on steam... but ok. If you do not have too much money in this game, nothing has changed, so if you have an original on the disc - do not buy on Steam, too much money.",

            "review_text": "This game is like The Settlers (Die Siedler/ Serf City: Life is Feudal). I have only played 2 tutorials though and it felt just like The Settlers except with more options that have to deal with 'personalizing' your settlement. You have to marry your citizens and assign them jobs and give them names. The chain of progress is more involved then The Settlers is.   The game won't launch at start though. You need to set compatibility to Windows XP (Service Pack 2). This will allow you start the game. Once you launch the game start a game mode and click on the options icon and manually change the settings.  If you ever played The Settlers AKA Serf City then buy it while it is only 50 cents.",
