            "review_text": "TL;DR: Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville is a light, zombie themed 4X game. It's fantastic and you should buy it.  I am a huge fan of Civ. I love the exploration, the gradual expansion, the sense of progress and increasing power.  As a Civ player I tend to turtle, that is, I like to build a solid and impenetrable perimeter before I expand further. Eventually, I'll push out to nab a bit of territory here, a strategic resource there. Over time, I'll get bigger and bigger, with every gain hard fought and locked down. Rebuild 3 might be my perfect game.  Another thing about Civ is that it is  not  intended to be a realistic government or historical simulator, I like the fact that Chairman Mao is fighting with Abraham Lincoln. I like the bright colours and the slightly irreverent tone. I don't need the game to include 'realistic' details like racism and slavery, and I don't mind the fact that swordsmen can occasionally kill a tank.  Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville is not a realistic zombie simulator, it contains cartoonish graphics, cannibalism, and over the top stereotypes. You can convert a field of rubble into a tower apartment block with a single builder. It's  fun . Obviously, however, if what you're after is something dark, brooding and 'realistic', this game is not for you.  One more thing. The prequel, Rebuild 2 (AKA Rebuild Mobile, or just 'Rebuild'), was a popular game on iOS and Android and Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville has also now been released on the same platforms. The mobile version is identical in every way to the PC version, and the game plays really well on the mobile. If you want your mobile games to stay on mobile then feel free to buy it there. But I'm mostly a PC player and I like my big screen and mouse control.  Regardless, Rebuild doesn't  feel  like a mobile game in that it's not particularly 'clicky', menus work like PC menus and the interface works like a PC interface. Still, it doesn't have infinite tech trees or massive worlds or complex animation and that's a huge part of its appeal.  Basically, if you're after a light 4X game with a very strong sense that you're always making progress, that doesn't become overwhelming towards the end game, that doesn't have dead time following an initial expansion/exploration rush, that strips out a lot of tedious micromanagement, and if you like your 4X games to completely play out in a couple of hours each, then this is your game.",

            "review_text": "I played the prequels too &amp; there is parts about it that I really like, but if I compare it to other games out there I lost interest quicker with rebuild 3. If you like a more casual take on games, you probably like it better than me.  Also I think it is too easy on challenging difficulty &amp; becomes very repetitive after you played like 2 or 3 towns in the campaign. Arriving at the 5th town on challenging diff, I haven´t lost anyone of the ~150 people I was commanding until then in different towns and setups - this should speak for itself. Always the same procedure, secure food supply. Create surplus, buy anything you want from factions. No challenge &amp; no suprises in that. If zombies ever get through a weak spot in your wall they just take away 1 field which is irrelevant because you own something like 30 anyway and retake it within 45 seconds. Always liked the start better than mid to late game like in most games where the survival challenge prevails...  The towns and characters are RND generated but that doesnt help much as you quickly learn the components they consist of by heart. The story writing is pretty good &amp; heavily inspired by the walking dead. The humor is the best thing about this game but you won´t read the same stories over and over again so you just click them away and the grinding (assigning tasks) remains. Actually the writing was the reason why I kept playing since I wanted to explore some quest lines and because I´m an hopeless addict to vid games in general. The weakest part IMO is, when you expanded a big fort in a city and are just waiting to finish quest lines parts with your leaders - being just a matter of time - and when you start hating the timer for not allowing you to talk to a faction again while there is nothing other left to do..",

            "review_text": "You might be scared because this game is part of a series that you probably never heard of, and it looks and feels like a mobile game ported to pc. But that's not fair, because it's actually surprisingly a good pc game. The gamestyle is casual, but has just enough RPG elements to make it interesting while not overburdening with complexity.   Rebuild3 is centered around managing a gang of survivors within a city. You control their equipment and assign them to missions. Each has five skills (combat, building, scavenging, leadership and engineering). Each member has an specific skill they are good at and can improve with the corresponding related mission. For example, you send fighters to attack zombies or builders to claim an empty buildings. Adding additional crew to a mission improves the rate of success. Over time, crew assigned to missions together may become friends or enemies (influencing happiness).  Throughout the game, you are presented with decisions how to lead people (e.g. help strangers vs being cautious). Once you succeed in a city, you learn a little more of the story and move on to the next city, leaving behind most of your gang. There are different endings based on your decisions.  Cons:   There are too many cities and the campaign takes too long time to complete.   Wish it had a higher difficulty setting (impossible is very possible).   Overall, I would recommend Rebuild 3 if you want to play something slightly casual or if you like management sims. If you prefer action, this game is probably not for you.  ",

Parts of the game that I really enjoy are: character creation, character management, character releationships and going to war with other factions trying to survive the zombie apocolypse. Some reviewers have claimed that they think the graphics would be a better fit on a phone or tablet; that is their opinion but not mine I think the art is does an excellent job of flushing out the characters and the deadly world they struggle to overcome. Overall I think this game is a great deal at the asking price.",

            "review_text": "I've always wanted a zombie apocalypse game where you actually rebuild instead of just survive. This game is the beginning of my hopes for that game. The structure is basic: you start out with a few buildings and a couple of survivors and you have to slowly conquer back the zombie wastelands and build a new start for humanity. The survivors have specializations which allow them to do different things for your settlement and as it grows people end up in relationships, end up in fights, or end up dead. Your leadership determines how well your settlement does. I never played the first two Rebuild games, but I was very satisfied with this one. My only gripe is that 3 missions into the campaign and I'm already getting swarmed with 2 or 3 zombie hordes every couple of minutes, which makes trying to establish a settlement near impossible since you have to keep sending all of your people off to fight the horde or guard your turf. There's also no real way to tell where a zombie horde or enemy faction group is going until they're already there (or if you just keep placing guards at every building in the vicinity until the danger meter changes color). It's also fairly basic with only a few building types to construct, a few technologies to research, and a few specialties for the survivors. I really kind of hope the devs (who I think are a husband/wife team) get bigger and make an expanded version of this game with 3-D graphics and expanded mechanics. If this is the quality of their games at a small level, I would only wonder what they could accomplish with EA's resources.",

Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville is an embarrassment to the Rebuild trilogy. The gameplay has simply been trampled all over in favour of even more resources you have to juggle. It feels like a chore to be 'playing this game', dragging survivors literally all over the city instead of having more options with the tiny patch of land you can barely maintain in the first place. Zombie attacks are so frequent that you'll spent pretty much all of your time waiting patiently for the zeds to attack you. That is not gaming. That's boring. That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. In Rebuild 2, there were so many strategies and options for how to end the game. Here, it's just like playing chess.",
