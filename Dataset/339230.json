            "review_text": "Before we start - this requires Uplay. If you don't like Uplay, avoid the game.    I've played this a bit on the Wii U, so I know enough about the game to give it a bit of a review at this stage.  You play as a survivor in London, England and you have a rather linear story mode, that focuses on intense close quarters combat rather than fighting off hordes of zombies. The survivor is pretty much a nameless person, as in they're not a hero in the story. If they die, they die. Anything they were carrying you 'lose'. You come back as someone else and continue the game. I say 'lose', because your recently dead survivor joins the undead and you can kill them to get your stuff back. This is a great mechanic and really adds to the immersion.  It's very much a survival horror, you can easily become overwhelmed if you make a mistake. You manage your inventory in game, and the game doesn't pause when you go into your backpack, so choosing the right location to do it is necessary. You have 4 quick slots to quickly access certain items (other weapons, medkits). You also have very limited inventory space, so you need to carefully choose what you take with you each time you leave (the rest goes into a storage box at the base).  You have guns, despite it being England, and finding a gun over here is about as likely as finding a zombie survival game with crafting that isn't in Early Access. Ammo can be pretty scarce since you need inventory slots to carry it, and instead opted for the melee weapons (like a cricket bat, I liked the reference to Shaun of the Dead). They take longer to kill zombies, but saving ammo is crucial.   Now for the port.  There is no framerate cap. I'm running it at 144fps. It has resolutions higher than 1080p (I'm on 1440p, so I don't know if it can do 4k) There is an FoV adjustment option, but it doesn't really give you much info other than -10% to 10%. Numbers would be better. There are no other options for editing AA, SSAO, Shadows etc. Basically, if the game doesn't run well on your machine, your only option is to lower the resolution. There are some unencrypted files in the base folder that seem to hint at changing things like MSAA, so perhaps someone will work them out if they actually do anything.  Initial impressions seems that it runs fine. Keeps steady at 144fps at 1440p. The graphics aren't going to win any awards, but for a £15 Wii U port, they're better than the original. I'm on quite a hefty machine (4790k @4.5ghz/SLI 980s/16gb RAM), so I can't speak for lower end users, but at least it's not like Arkham Knight where you can overpower it and still get sub par performance.  Overall, I'd recommend it. It's not a bad game, and the port is pretty good, even if there are a lack of options in the menu.   Something else I didn't like was that it gives me the Xbox controls on screen (the controller is plugged in), despite using the mouse and keyboard. Something PS4 controller users might like is that in the options, you can change it to display PS controller button prompts. It's a case of either using a controller or memorising the keyboard controls. I'll do the latter.",

            "review_text": "Ah, Zombi. Undoubtedly Ubisoft's attempt at cashing in on the zombie craze. I was reluctant to pick up this game at first due to the mixed reviews, and the fact that I'm still angry at Ubisoft over Assassin's Creed: Unity. In fact I haven't bought a Ubisoft game since that catastrophe, which I paid full price for. I'm also pretty sick of zombie and zombie accessories. But my friend was feeling pretty bad today, and I knew that playing this would cheer her right up since she'd ask me to play it a while ago.  First off, this game runs through both uPlay and Steam. I really don't understand the point of this, other than Ubisoft maintaining their uPlay Reward system; which is crap, if you ask me. The game has Steam achievements, so uPlay is really unnecessary here. About an hour into the game, I encountered my first game crashing bug... I simply attempted to remove a barricade from a door. Luckily my save point was only about 10-15 minutes from the point where I crashed, but others may not be so lucky.  By the third hour in, I'd made it halfway through the very linear storyline. There are a good variety of zombie models, although you will encounter many zombies that look the same. There are also 'special' zombies (L4D) like the Spitter. I've managed to grab three different guns at this point, although I'm stuck with the same melee weapon that you start with. So far I've been through the streets, a supermarket, sewers and part of Buckingham Palace. I have to say that the setting of Zombi is unique, I don't recall having gone through London in any zombie game before.  The level designs are fairly boring with little to do. Most of the time when you go to loot any container, or body, in the open world they're empty. So it makes exploring a little pointless and dreary. I should also mention at this point that anytime you die, you come back as another survivor. So there is a minimal rogue-like essence here. However, I just lost my first survivor and I did not even die. Out of nowhere, while I was attacking, the zombie jumped through my attack animation and infected me; while I was at full health. You lose all your stuff when you 'die', so good luck getting it back.  Overall, up to this point I have had a fair bit of fun and I've had many moments where I've screamed; which is rare for me in horror games anymore. I'm not necessarily scared during the gameplay, but the jumpscares are actually fun. Normally I hate jumpscares with a passion. Sadly, Ubisoft are (typically) unresponsive in the forums about crash and bug fixes. The graphics are completely under par for the current generation and have an annoying haze to them. I can't recommend the game for the price, but I can recommend it on sale. Just be forewarned about the issues that will most likely never get fixed, let alone noticed.    Rating:  2.5/5.0  - It's not awful, but it's not great.",

            "review_text": "UPDATE:  The game crashes habitually and DOES NOT AUTO SAVE. That's right, it'll just CTD and lose you an hour of gameplay for no good reason. I'm downgrading this one to a 4/10 and Uninstalling. Piece of ♥♥♥♥.    Hrm, mixed feelings about this one.   The game itself is a solid, although not exceptional survival experience. You roam around the metro tunnels and abandoned streets of London in search of snickers bars and handgun ammo. Ocassionally you run into zombies, whose heads you must beat in with your trusty cricket bat. The combat isn't particularly deep or even very satisfying, but it provides some basic sense of tension and fun because of just how hard it is to keep a zombie down. The gore / damage modeling is pretty basic with the head being the only 'destroyable' part of the zombie (that i've noticed thus far).  So that's the game, and on its own I'd say it's kind of a 7/10 type experience. Not bad, even pretty good. But not exceptional. But then there's the whole 'Port' side of things, where its clear that nobody gave a single ♥♥♥♥ about making this work correctly on the PC.   - Must restart game to change resolution - Letter boxing, and no support for different aspect ratios. - Xbox controller UI art, even when you're not using a controller. - Clumsy inventory system which is a nightmare to manage - Unskippable intro cinematics - Muddy looking graphics with non-optional post process effects. - Requires Ubisofts lame 'UPlay' service to run - etc. etc.  It just adds up to drag the game down to more of a 5 or 6 out of 10 type experience. If you're REALLY hooked on zombies, I guess it's worth a punt. But I'm starting to think I should have just bought 'Dying Light' instead.",

Usually when you use the Scanner, one of the key mechanics of the game so you are forced to use it. Of course this makes it un-playable.  Third Party registration...

            "review_text": "Overall I felt this was a good game, good story behind it and plenty of jumpscares which kept it interesting. I had only 4 issues with this game, two of them small and the other two intertwined.  Problem 1: Melee Combat, this can get very repetetive even with the new melee weapons you find throughout the game.  Problem 2: You can't use the scopes on scope weapons or aim down the sights, I find this to be a big issue as with some weapons you could be hitting your target at a range easily with aiming using the sights is not possible in this game, especially with scopes. Sure this problem is remedied slightly having upgrades to your weapons to reduce spread, but it only remedies it to an extent.  Problem 3: Saving the game, i'm used to going through doors and the game saving for me or 'fast travelling' or going into the menu and pressing save game, in ZOMBI this is not possible as you have to sleep in a designated save bed/sleeping bag.  Problem 4: Crashing, so far I have only crashed once in ZOMBI and this was a hug pain in the ♥♥♥ because I was just about to complete a mission, getting the anti-biotics from the nursery and as those of you who completed that mission know how easy it is to ♥♥♥♥ your pants in the process. So it had to load me back before I even started the mission, this issue ties in with saving as the save system is spot specific.  Well thats what I think about this game so far and I thouroughly enjoy the game aside from these problems and I reccomend this game to those who like games in the horror/zombie genre.",

            "review_text": "This game would be a very average FPS, but manages to pull off a few good tricks to lift itself above mediocrity.  Most of these tricks owe to a nod to Dark Souls. Levels are nicely interlinked, if linear, but more importantly, the death system helps you get a sense of affinity for your character, and makes you want to survive and plan rather than quickload. Death results in you spawning as another randomly generated survivor, with a need to hunt down your previously zombified self if you want to reclaim your backpack. The game puts some effort into giving each new survivor a unique character, from their own outfit and gender down to an ID card with their age, occupation, and stat tracking of how long they've survived and their individual score. As a result, you tend to get the same involvement as with a squad member in X-COM - after you've struggled through a few hours as the same character, you really want to see how long you can last.  It's important the game generates tension this way, since combat itself is fairly simplistic and where the similarities with Dark Souls end. For a large part of the game the default cricket bat will serve you well, to the extent that guns are largely unneccessary. This has a knock-on effect of you saving ammo to the point it's scarcity isn't an issue in the later stages of the game, which is a shame. This isn't a hard game, but the desire to stay alive rather than save-zerg helps maintain suspense, and it is certainly possible to meet a swift end if you make a mistake.  Visually, the game has some interesting locations, and whilst it's not going to be picking up any awards for next-gen graphics or push a high-end PC to its limits, it looks suitably atmospheric. I've seen some reports of crashing, but on my vanilla rig (i7/9700) I've yet to experience one. The audio gets the job done, with the usual zombie moans alerting the player and some good player voice acting reflecting their terror after caving in a zombie's head.  In terms of the negatives, a uPlay account being needed is an obvious one, but not too much of a pain to set up if you don't have one already. The plot is rather scattered and implausible, with your character unswervingly doing what they're told even if it flies in the face of common sense or survival instinct, and not helped by the questions raised by the player character changing but the NPCs treating them as the same person. Given the alternative of a single character with a quicksave/load function, though, it's a worthwhile tradeoff. Multiplayer was dropped for the port, but it wasn't that great in the first place, and there are many better multiplayer zombie games out there.   This is basically a solid 20 hours or so of atmospheric, single-player FPS gaming. Not a AAA title, but a worthwhile experience at the price tag.",

            "review_text": "After seeing the good graphics and atmosphere in trailers and screenshots I decided to buy this game and try it out. A good survival horror for 20 bucks? Hell yea!  The graphics and atmosphere are good, despite the fact there being little to no graphical options, I certainly had nothing to complain whilst in game. The atmostphere is awesome allover. I like the element where you are turned into a zombie when you die, and respawn as a new survivor with the possibility to get the gear back from the last survivor you played.   You can hack boxes so that the cameras connected to it in a certain area create an up-to date map for you. That together with the possibility of barracading doors and planting mines creates interesting options to master a certain area, which can be useful (and imo added to the gameplay) when forced to flee from a horde of brain-thirsty zombies.   After 2.5 hrs of play however the game started to be less and less entertaining for me. The reason for this started out with some minor frustrations within item interaction. Then I got the feeling that it was the same all the time. Just smashing or shooting zombies with a new weapon that looks almost the same as your previous, and has no new graphical effects. Again a quest where I have to retrieve this from that area. The storyline didn't bring enough for me to keep these quests interesting. And this 'Prepper' guy... After 4 hrs of playing I got obsessed with finding him and shooting him through the head. There is no option to turn his voice down and for some reason he can't seem to shut up for atleast 3 mins. Most of the time babbling the same crap about how important it is to survive. And when he was used to develop progress in the storyline, he had already frustrated me to a point where I just put off my headphones.  Keep in mind I played this for only 4 hrs, but here is my conclusion: For a 20 buck game pretty solid, but not the surival horror I expected it to be + Graphics + Atmosphere - Promising elements not worked out sufficient (barracading and mining, upgrading weapons) - Uninteresting story - Most weapons have the same graphical effects, stronger zombies just have a glow - Almost no options to adjust graphics/sound (most annoying being 'the Prepper' who can't seem to shut up)  Unfortunatly not a 20 buck miracle, but stands decent for it's price.

If I was to describe my experience with this game I would have to say that it has become one of my favourite games, even on it's normal mode with survivor difficulty it was painstakingly hard, the game actually made me jump a couple times! Zombi is possibly one of the best zombie games that we have ever recieved.  I love it! 9/10  Toned my review down since as now I can have a less hyped perspective on things.

And this is coming from someone who HAS the console version.  the price is better, too. but I would still suggest waiting for a sale.   This is one of those games that not only leaves you wanting for more, but it also has alot (and I mean ALOT) of unspent potential.... Worth checking out, but not as your primary way of entertainment for the next month, it'll last a week at best for you, depending on how slowly you pace yourself ;)  By the way, if you are not a fan of jumpscares, I'd still buy it. It has a few, but you are able to cope with them, and learn to expect them. Some you won't even notice if you heed the rule of double tap.    *Spoilers ahead, beware*   So, what is this game about? Well, you take the role of a zombie outbreak survivor in london. You are found by a mysterious man calling himself ''the prepper'' he takes you in, and sends you around to scavenge, on your way, you will discover new locations within london, visit the royal palace, kill royal guards that are zombified, and meet a scientist trying to develop a cure.  You then help the scientist while still managing your supplies and eventually you DO find a vaccine and try to escape london, but then that's actually it.  *Spoilers are over, not that they were so big to begin with....*  if I HAD to rate this game, it'd say 6/10 whereas the Wii version would gain a mere 2/10 from me. the different controls really did something good for this game, aiming and scanning is not a chore, it's convenient, headphones allow for manual tracking of zeds, and zeds are generally easier to hit. Weapon swapping is also much more reliable.  No multiplayer was a bummer, the MP mode is hillarious to play with friends on the console, but got dumped on here and instead you can view your achievements.  Oh, biggest flaw ever; Requires Uplay, but at least it doesn't have to be launched with the uplay launcher itself, it will launch from steam.",

If I was being truthful though, I love the Wii U version of this game. it's weird to think that they would port a game from such an inferior platform and have it be worse than the original. This was just a lazy port to try and finally make money off of a license. They make no effort to make this a better game on PC. They should have added neat stuff that maybe they didn't think of before, like online multiplayer. They had so much time to analyze what they did wrong with the first one and improve upon it. What I'm saying is, I want a definitive edition or something. Something that adds features not takes them away. I honestly have no idea how this would have worked on PC but the Wii U local multiplayer was a blast to play. They could have figured something out, instead they just scrapped it and shoved the product out the door. Only buy this if you love survival horror, because it's a great surivival game. But if you have a Wii U, just play that version. Not only will it be cheaper, the exerience is far better. I hate that I feel like I have to give this a negative because I have so much fun with this game, even on PC. But it is not worth having to deal with Uplay's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to play an ultimately inferior version of such a great game.",

The loot system is horrible, half the containers are empty, but you still need to open them to know they are (unlike skyrim and such games), the zombies are ALWAYS empty, except for the occasional fruit bar. You only have like 12 inventory slots, and 4 or 5 are permanently occupied by your weapon, btw you will use a Paddle to kill zombies throughout the whole game with no rewarding upgrade system, you just found rewards randomly, i understand this is because of the death system this game manages, but it is just boring since you wont try to get better to upgrade or something. The combat system scks big time, when you have a chance to finish downed opponents, it wont work and i find myself getting hurt only when this happens. Overall the game feels pretty old, you cant scan while moving, no weapons, no upgrades, no story...etc. The only good thing about it, is the atmosphere, which gets old in just a few minutes. I didnt like dead island that much, but peeking this game, made me understand dead island wasnt that bad AT ALL, actually dead island is exactly like this game, but better in every aspect, even atmosphere.",

Secondly, while the graphics are not awful, there are no options to tweak the graphics except for screen resolution, which is awful. Thirdly. I came across this game through the 'Open World' tag and then researched it a bit and decided to try it, but this game is not really open world. There are loading screens galore along with horribly designed map spaces that are very limiting, which just gets worse when you realize that you cannot crouch or jump in a 'Survival Horror Game'. Bottom line is, this is a sub par game thats not really what it markets itself to be and ontop of being an awful port $20 is way too much for this game (Maybe I'd recommend it if it was around $5 at the most). I requested a refund so I'd suggest anyone wanting to try this game out to keep your playtime under 2 hours.",

I could complain that the graphics are mediocre or that the game is so weird that they think that if England suffered a zombie apocalypse then our first reaction is to vist the monarchy. Ignoring them issues the game it's self is quite boring. The gameplay remindes me of Dead Island where it's just very cluncky, slow and dull. The gun play works fine but since your at limited ammo and you don't want to attract noise, its not worth the risk so you end up playing constent wack a mole with your trusty cricket bat against the zombies. The constent moaning as you hit the zombies heads almost gets annoying and it takes so many hits, please if your going to make a sequal, make a range of weapons to bash the zombies heads with to make the combat less tedious.   However, the whole idea of the game is acually great and I think it deserves another shot. The dark murky atmostphere did honestly bring me the chills and scared me at times. The games permerdeath system is really unique. When you die, you lose all your supplies and if you want them back then you need to kill the zombie version of old you. Its acually amazing how you almost grow a emotional attachment to your character after a while and your gutted to see him or her die not just because of the suppies but the person itself is a loss.   I think that ubisoft should give Stright Right another shot at making this better (making a sequal). A better combat, better graphics and less 'WiiU'ness would possible make this one of the best zombie horror game since resident evil. Sadly though, this is not something i would recommend buying unless you are just doing it to ask for a sequal.",

The developers did a really smart job of borrowing some Souls game design and wrapping it into a slow-paced zombie survival horror game. While the run back to regain your weapons and supplies isn't quite as punishing as the Souls games, a death does feel more fittingly punishing than just a checkpoint restart. The level design is surprisingly clever and does a really nice job of feeling just layered enough to make revisits to areas interesting (being able to mark locked doors on the map is really handy). The combat feels just the right level of clunky. The melee weapons are pretty poor for mobs, while the guns feel slow and weak unless you nail headshots consistently. The balance works well and keeps each engagement interesting as you weigh your options. I loved the mood of the game too. It's aggressively British and the fog and grime help out the weaker aspects of the visuals.   Verdict: Give it a shot.",
