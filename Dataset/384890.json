            "review_text": "Interesting concept, but the execution falls flat. Worth $2-3 for an evening distraction if you find it on sale, but it's nothing more than that. I finished the game in about 4 hours total (left it running through the day on accident, thus the extra hours on my record).  There's nothing open ended to the game, it's all about finding the exact right string of commands to get to the next part of the story. Guessing passwords is a 50/50 split, either it's completely handed to you or you're left with almost no clue.   If you really want a fantasy hacker game, look up Uplink instead.",
