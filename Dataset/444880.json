While it's not without it's issues, I have a strong faith in the dev team to iron out the bugs and leave behind a really well done, polished gem. I've seen game play and have played a little of the game myself, and I'm super excited to play more with my friends at our next game night. I'd definitely recommend this game, especially if you have a few controllers handy!",

The game has a fairly simple premise by getting to the top of the stairs but how hectic the game can get with 2 other people racing you is pretty fun. It can sometimes feels like you are getting constantly pwned and completely unfair but it still feels fun to have a laugh with other people.  (Note, I received the game by being a Kickstarter backer)",
