            "review_text": "Played the game, and probably finished it around 20mins. Wasn't as fun as I thought it would be with the whole hacking, and stealth scenario. Even if you disguise yourself, the enemies can still kill you, regardless if you've commited an evil act or not. Definitely not worth the $12.99. Only reason I got the game was through the Humble Bundle. If you're the type of gamer who's all about speed running games, and becoming #1, then this might be the game for you, but other than that, it wasn't that great.",

            "review_text": "Light is an interesting little game which puts emphasis on stealth-based gameplay. Looking at the pictures you would not think it has a story as the square-shaped characters all represent the employees of a multinational company with a sinister agenda.   And while it is interesting to find out who you are and what the company is after just because there are intel files scattered across the dozen levels I would not call this a 'gripping narrative'. On almost every level you need to find the exit while avoiding the cone of vision the company guards have. Regularly, you need to hack a terminal or the door but the hacking is simply done with the press of a button without the inclusion of any minigames.  The problem with Light is that the text the creators came up with that appears on the store page is misleading - it simply makes us believe that this is a more complex game than what it really is. This is not necessarily a problem - especially if a game has a great soundtrack such as Light - but Light's gripping tale suddenly ends after 12 levels. Half of which can be completed in a mere half an hour. Then you finish the game in another half an hour and you make up your mind whether or not to let the game idle for an additional 2-3 just to get all the missing trading cards.  I did stay. Still, I do not recommend this game as I'm sure there are many others such as Light but either with more interesting story and more complex mechanics - things that make you stay longer.",

It's too bad. Still, I won't hesitate to buy the next game from this studio. They have tons of talent and now have very clear feedback on what they need to focus on next time. Seems like a guaranteed hit. Good luck!   OLD REVIEW BELOW Wow, great game! Why then am I saying don't buy it? Because it's an hour long. It's also not really challenging at all. I failed 3 levels and the rest I passed on my first try. What we have here are a team of great artist, composer, programer and project manager but completely lacking a dedicated or talented level designer(sorry to offend this person). The game just isn't long enough or challenging and without a massive community of mod makers this game is theft at $9. If you can get it for $5, go for it.   I will definitely buy the inevitable multiplayer sequel.",

            "review_text": "If I had to describe Light to anybody, it'd probably be 'Soliton Radar System: The Game.' Those familiar with the Metal Gear Solid series will be familiar with the phrase and know what it means, but to the uninitiated, Light is a minimalist stealth game where your number one objective is to complete simple 'find the item, hack the consoles' while staying out of the enemies' and cameras' cones of vision.   There's really not that much more to the game. Avoid cones, access data, and engage in a simple hacking mechanic to open doors and shut off cameras. Coming in at a very small twelve missions, it shouldn't take anyone who grasps the mechanics quickly enough that long to complete, and there's not really much else to engage with beyond getting better scores on each mission.   Light makes for a pretty fun one or two hour experience, but the price tag may be just a tad high for how little content there is and how simple the mechanics are. Had the hacking and disguise systems been fleshed out just a tad more and the narrative been a bit more involved, I'd have considered it somewhere close to the level of Gunpoint. At its current price however, it's probably best to hold off for a sale or permanent price drop before committing.",

Thumbs down!'  Is this game overpriced ? Got it on a sale so NO, it was not.  Is this game short ? Yes!  Is this a stealth game ? Yes!  Does it has flaws ? Yes of course, like every other game out there  The soundtrack ? Beautiful..great..cool!  The Graphics ? Cool look, but nothing special at all  Do i have fun with it ? Yes!  .....thats all enough for me to recommend this game....and for those people complaining about the price and those who dont want to pay that ammount......  .....you better go collect stamps then instead of playing computergames.",

            "review_text": "I thought this looked somewhat promising when I saw it on Greenlight, but after playing the game, I've found every single aspect of the game is underdeveloped. The stealth is shallow, the hacking is shallow, the plot is shallow, the graphics are bland, and the amount of bugs I encountered was significant for a game not in early access.  The level design is generally obnoxious, due in large part to the game not having a checkpoint system. Having to repeatedly restart a level because you unknowingly walk into an unwinnable situation, or because of one mistake, or because of a bug is just terrible. I encountered one during a lengthy mission where the plot requires you to get caught at the end, but during my first playthrough of that level, getting caught registered a mission failure instead. And because the levels are all about waiting for an opening in the surveillance, it becomes all the more irritating. One particular level has you wait in the starting room for a solid 10 seconds before the AI pathing and security systems let you move on.  The comments others made about it being a demo are right. There's not enough content in the game to earn the pricetag, let alone good content.",

            "review_text": "Unfortunately I cannot recommend Light. Although I like the stealth mechanics, the music and the style, the list of negative points is just too big - even if you ignore the price (as nowadays you can get nearly any game on a discount sooner or later; I got this game when it was 75% off, for example):     The gameplay should be much more diverse. While I am not saying there should be lots of gimmicks for the player, I feel that not even the hacking mechanics was explored enough.    As soon as a level is a bit bigger it becomes more confusing than interesting. Bigger levels are also bad for the hacking mechanics, as it zooms to other parts of the level and this can get annoying.    The game has a lot of glitches. The guards can see through walls rarely but noticable. Even more annoying are the big leaps I got from time to time - from one moment to the other my character warped several meters forward, often landing in the visible cone of a camera or guard.    The story began interesting even though a bit cliché-ridden. I can't even tell exactly how the story progressed, as it became boring pretty soon, unfortunately.    The game is very short. This was mentioned a lot already, but generally I would not put that on a list of negatives. But I did play Light in a 'harder' mode, where I tried not to get seen and not to kill anybody. This was somewhat satisfying and made the game longer than the usual 45 minutes (see my play time) - still the game was just too short, and the number of missions much too small.      The second-to-last mission, which seems to be the game's climax, forces you to kill someone even if you took care not to use violence throughout the game.      The developers promised more levels, but never delivered them, without any explanations.   So while I enjoyed some parts of the game, I just cannot recommend it, as in it's current state is just wasted potential.",

            "review_text": "Incredibly stylish visuals and a strong electronica soundtrack are the high points of a game that lasts roughly half an hour. Then the credits are rolling, you’ll have at least 12 of the 13 achievements and absolutely no reason to revisit this ever again.   Light is essentially a top down stealth game, the only problem being that stealth is almost entirely unnecessary due to the ability to kill guards, simple level design and a general difficulty factor of “Non-existent.” Game mechanics such as being able to drag enemy bodies and hide them in lockers are quickly revealed to be utterly pointless, while hacking is little more than a delayed standard interaction. Even the threat of enemy reinforcements, a two-minute timer counting down from the moment you make your first kill, means very little - in the unlikely event that they manage to arrive before you beat the level, they’re just as easy to dispose of as regular enemies. There is no tension, no frantic escapes or desperate assaults, and consequently the game ends up feeling nothing like a stealth game and more like a 2D walking simulator.   Which might not be so bad if the story was compelling. Told entirely in text boxes just a little too small (and with words that often miss out the letter L. Intentional or not, it’s distracting), it begins on the cliché of “waking with amnesia” and never really recovers. There’s no hook - vital to any game storyline, let alone a game of this length - and the little boxes of text soon become as pointless as the ability to disguise yourself in a guard’s clothes. Beyond that, the narrative simply doesn’t gel with a game world in which the people are, well, cubes. Minimalism and storytelling worked for Thomas Was Alone because of a fantastic voiceover and a solid few hours of gameplay. Both are missing here, and it’s impossible for me to imagine anyone walking away from the story feeling inspired, enlightened or otherwise impressed.   The graphics and audio really are Light’s saving graces, then, and they work in almost perfect symphony. With a perspective that immediately invokes Hotline Miami, the distinct visuals allow Light to take on an identity of its own with striking environments that create a perfect blend of digital and reality. The music is similarly terrific, providing an atmospheric soundtrack with an air of the suspenseful and the ominous, without ever straying too close to downbeat. It’s mostly enjoyable on its own, too, which makes the soundtrack's inclusion with purchases of the game a nice touch.   But in the end, there’s simply not enough content here, or content that plays well, to justify spending anything more than the cost of a (cheap) coffee. Even high score fanatics will be hard-pressed to stick with it for any longer than one or two hours. I don’t believe the developers - a team of five, according to the credits - set out to make a poor game, or to rip anyone off, but regardless, the game as it exists now functions as little more than a demonstration, a proof-of-concept, perhaps even the tutorial to what should have been a bigger title. It’s a shame, because Light’s not a bad game, not truly - it's just not enough of a game at all.",
