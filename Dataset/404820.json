Multiple athletic events', then this is the game for you, you sick, twisted, so and so.  In all seriousness, I highly rate this game, it's a lot of fun, makes you constantly keep saying 'one more try' and lets you backflip and wiggle like a fish out of water. 10/10.",

Over all it's worth $5 and It's fun and makes you want to keep trying to beat records to climb higher on the leaderboard. Certainly addictive, but needs more content.",
