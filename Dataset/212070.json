            "review_text": "Star Conflict is a good looking arcadish space sim with pretty fun gameplay and enjoyable flight physics. The ship models looks great with some really well designed maps and sky boxes.  Unfortunately, just like vast majority of free to play titles, this is an incredibly grindy game as you progress up the tiers while it feels more and more pay to win too. I think it is also a bait and switch as the first couple of tiers are pretty fair and enjoyable but as you move up the tiers of your ship, the grind and pay to win gets exponentially worse.  Avoid it at all cost. I do not recommend this grind fest. A game should be an enjoyable experience, not a grindy mechanism that feels like a second job.",

            "review_text": "I started to play this in March 2013, was involved in 3 years of community &amp; corporation building and loved it. Met many awesome people and perspectives and was totally hooked. I respected the devs for making their vision a reality and not give in to peoples demands of bigger ships, more auto aim weaponry and the overall dominance of skilled - play in this game made this game so much more challenging than a lot of other titles. If you played well you won, if you played ♥♥♥♥ you lose. There was always issues but the core gameplay was (mostly) fine and fluent. Unfortunatly the first cornerstone was Open space. With that, the whole mission bs started, Missions that contained 0 fun, 0 gameplay, 0 surprise, just grind, in its purest form. And they are still like that. it took them half a year to start ajusting the insane restrictions and they are still there. I will not list the issues in chronological order because i cant remember what happened when exactly.  - Removal of squads, thats right, you cannot play with your friends, nor train your corpmates.  - introduction of destroyers and 'live' balancing that will go for antoher half a year. - removal of social features. You cannot see what your friends are doing, at all. - Promotion of sit and tank gameplay and the systematic nerfing of skill &amp; endurance played classes. (limiting of firing arc, wich isnt that bad, but the implementation is) Todays interceptor of choice is the ECM. No skill in that. - Leagues, the 'new' supplement for squadplay. It's the old sector conquest relived with a new name and a very narrow timeframe of playability. I could only play 1 hour of leagues per day if i wanted to. Plus further restrictions, like your team has to be set befor the timer starts and the fact that training less experienced players there, is futile and just a slap in the face for any pilots motivation. Nothing bad with losing, but very frustrating when you have no opportunities to train. - The ultimate 'mood killer' for me as Vp of a corp was the fact that our communitiy that has a very intimate nature of communication and relies on friendships and not so much on other things to work, was that the devs actively tried to disrupt this with limiting information and keeping the flow of playing together disrupted. I feel that they don't deserve a recruiting corp like us that literally ripped their asses out at times to keep things going. - They failed to thoroughly remove items from older players for years, giving them advantages at times and when they introduced destroyers they turned the tide. Suddenly new players could simply obtain the parts by leveling up, whereas older generations of players like me still dont have destros. Because we have to grind this ♥♥♥♥, no thank you. ( ispent all gs i got since then on this ♥♥♥♥, jsut to see if i could eventually reach it but nono)  There is more, but nobody cares. These devs inferiority complex will kill the game. They are a niche game with a great competitive potential but they dumped it. Or is it their publisher? nobody cares, sc numbers go down until the next big feature and then it will happen again and again until the pond is empty.  I cannot recommend this game to anyone anymore. Exept maybe, you are russian and you really really want to play with other russians.  Have i mentioned grind? :D Just look for yourself! ",

I decided to give the game a fair try by playing on my friend's account (he is on tier 4) and the pay-to-win factor is at an all time high. It gets rather annoying, knowing that a 'free' to play game is so prominately dominated by people who buy their ships and weapons. Whereas in games like tf2, the people who pay get equipment that is grossly overpowered, and people who stay free--either due to no money or no care to buy things--seemingly cant win. Above this, however, I've seen problems with the administrators. They seem rather...rude, to put it in nice terms. And with that concept, they are fairly jerks. The devs are the same way, though in more of a racist aspect (Russians being the overlords). Anyway, to kilter back to subject, I do NOT reccomend this game unless you want a fair share of ragequits and unenjoyable experiences.",

            "review_text": "Star Conflict... the description of 'World of Tanks in Space' works pretty well to describe it. While it lacks the intricacy of research and training crew that World of Tanks does, it still has a very similar experience grind that many other Free-to-Play games have used (Mechwarrior Online comes to mind.)  You spend time working your way through the tiers of each faction, factions you can change if you have enough credit earned from fights, each tier more powerful than the last. You have four basic types available to you ranging from small Covert Ops ships, intended for sneaky hit-and-runs against specific targets, to larger frigates that are there for longer range support with repair abilities.  The game looks absolutely stunning overall, with great dynamic lighting effects that I would have never expected from a DirectX9-based game. Effects are easily recognizable as well, giving you an easy way of knowing what is coming at you and what is going out.  The UI is serviceable. It lacks a certain flavor that would compliment the theme of the game, going fo ra simple 'MMO' styled hot-button interface for extra utilities that your ship may have that dominates the bottom of the screen. The targeting cursor, or the mouse in combat, can also get lost in the middle of combat as well. Since the cursor is a a little too minimalist, and the HDR causes the screen to flash white violently at times, it becomes far too difficult to figure out just where your turrets are aiming.  Audio is alright. Voice acting is pretty poor, with quality on par with a modding team that doesn't quite have the experience needed to pull off something believable. 'We have lost our commander!' comes out as someone just fresh from high-school trying to pretend to be in a position of authority with no believable emotion what-so-ever. They try to emphasize a lot, and in the end they sound pretty silly and cringe-worthy.  On the case of balance, low-tier equipment seems to do pretty well against anyone you'd get matched up with, but as you start pushing to higher tiered fights, the discrepancy between earnable ships and paid for or 'Premium' ships starts becoming readily apparent. Ships purchased by 'Gold Standards' with premium status have higher base stats than their earnable counter-parts and also manage to avoid the costs of repairs. Equipment purchased with 'Gold Standards' also gives a top tier benefit that one must grind for with a specific faction to get, allowing people who pay cash to not only have a better core ship, but better equipment compared to the rest of their competitors.  The game's currency rate seems a bit strange. After checking the math, it comes to about 300 'Gold Standards' per US$1 which translates to $2.20 for the cheapest premium ship, $27.50 for one of the most expensive ships, $10 for a single month 'license' that grants you increased chances for loot if you win a battle (which in turn grants credits and rare equipment), or $48 for a six-month 'license' for loot as well.  While the licenses are less expensive than that of a standard MMORPG or MMO game in any right, everything else seems to tack on as extras. Cosmetics also cost roughly US$0.05 each depending on their type, certain equipment to mount on your ships also add to the cost, and really feels like the entire game is based on either trying to pull as much money out of you as it can for mid-tier (as that's where most players are), or nickel and diming you to death for cosmetic design.  Overall, the game can be fun, but the mid-tier combat is very much dominated by that of people who have either (rightfully) earned their equipment, or purchased it all, with premium ships looking more flashy than that of their earnable counterparts. This sets up a sense of each fight being unfair, regardless of the skill involved.  If you can tolerate the mid-field tendency for pay-to-win behaviors, and hopefully push to 'end-game' tiers, then you'll have a great time with this game, but if you're sensitive to the possibility of buying out a win by equipment advantages, it may not be for you.",

            "review_text": "First I was very happy to find this game. Its a Shooter not a Simulation. Was telling an interested friend 'wow - i can totaly personalize my ship (modules, weapons, crew, ...)'.  The Game was cool until Tier III. But then you will have to pay or accept it as your new 8h-Job and forget about real life. So its more a DEMO than F2P! If you dont want to pay it becomes boring very fast, because if you want to proceed you need to do: PvE-Missions Waiting to start 2-6 minutes for 4 players and 2 stupid bots. (First i didn't think 'lame PvE-Missions' and 'stupid bots' but if you have to do them 20-30 times just to level up and get a ship which is worse than your actual one, because its fresh and not leveled, you begin to forget very or less fast that this is/was a fun game and not your boring job.) PvP-Missions There you will propably be matched vs. ships 2 levels higher than yours or some one who bought an imba special ship for money. But there is more. The big destroyers. i liked the game without them. The matches were dynamic and fast. Now its more like a siege or static warfare than a good (dog) fight. Even tha maps changed into something cold and uninspiring. Since some patches the whole thing is mostly green and dark... Its soooooo sad. I liked it very much in the beginning!",

            "review_text": "Mention: I am solo player, PVE only, no cooperation Ok after 260 hours i can say the following about the game:  pros: - graphics are nice as well as the environmental set up, you have asteroids fields and structure fileds and giant ships wrecks. so it looks nice for me :) - its highly addictive due to the ships and weapons system. you have a ships tree where you can level each ship type and set it up with lots of weapons and modules and also level them. Thats really nice in the beginning always trying to get something better :)  neutrals: - the steering is quite complicated in the beginning but one can adapt quite fast to it. (i just tried mouse/keyboard)  contras: - why I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game is: after 260hours im still lvl12 of 15. and the game feels so unbalanced! Lets start prior with: there are 3 LVL ranges where you can play together: lvl 1-3; lvl 4-9 and lvl 10-15 And when you use ships at the lower level border (and you have to cause you need to level upwards) then its just too ♥♥♥♥ing difficult. lvl 4-5 is makable after some time and experience and you need not much points to level higher. But level 10-12 PVE you can just forget! hit. bam dead. I want to know if ever anybody leveld from lvl 10 without any higher ship in the team the PVE missions. Feels undoable!! Impossible! Now that leads to the fact that: people can buy higher ships and good equip for real money. Then they can play even the hard stuff. but then they make points on a ship already fully leveled and equipped and again have to spend money to process the points to other ships. thats not as claimed 'pay to faster proceed' Thats PAY TO WIN  PLEASE STAR CONFLICT TEAM SHOW ME A VIDEO WHERE YOU ALL HAVE JUST LVL 10 SHIPS AND GREEN EQUIPP AND LVL 10 CREW AND FINISH SUCH A PVE MISSION! ADDON: -With lvl 12 engineer and good team the 10-15 PVEs are quite ok, but even then in the PVE Missions designed for lower levels are some heavy spikes of incoming enemies thats realy still hard. And one needs the points for leveling.   - next is if youre doing PVE only it feels the same and same s.h.i.t all over again. Just too less different PVE missions boooooooring.  - next: it takes soooo long to level. i have around 330 hours now and are still lvl 13 max. Things are so expensive. And with recent update they added that you need a base ammount of ships in each faction to reach the levels. That means you cant just level one ship type, you have to level many! That just increses and increases the need of doing the few same lvls thousands and thousands of times. for lvl 13 i did the 7 PVE Maps now about 1500 times - boooooring!  - Yes you can undock from the station and stay there and wait hours and hours for some little mobs that you can kill solo for some weeny few points. boooring! - then they have pve maps where you just have one little spec ops ship and you can fly to the station and hide there and do nothing but hit the station whilest the others die, and these guys even get the most points. super! that forces teamplay, really!   ADDON: i just forgot.. newest thing is that they added big destroyer ships. really nice. LVL 8 the first one they are big and powerfull, can shoot over the whole map nearly and.. are only affordable to the high rank players. i mean these players that anyway have all equipp, they now also get a totally overpowered ship. so all noob players wont get a hit. nice nice. and new players cant get the ressources to build that stuff cause you only can find them in lvl 10+ regions or drops. well done.  in this game as noob you have to play better than the high level to get something!  summary: Nice game but: If you try to play this game as PVE and without fix team or corporation in random team and not buying anything for real money i would not suggest you to waste the time!  I suggest: dont focus on more ships and regions, focus on the balance of the game content!  For all who like pvp and like to be in a fixed group company thats a great game! :) The space scenarios are gorgeous to fly through. The game is so nice damn i just wished i could play it solo.. anyway im gona try ;)  ADDON: Because i dont see any process by doing the few Levels again and again.. and again i now have uninstalled the game. Just wasting time addicted.. but aint that any gaming? ö.Ö Its up to your decision.. ;)",

I took out one of my better ships into the world in my first attempt at undocking.  What I found was just a lot of emptyness and confussion. The missions seem to go from 'go pick up fuel and go kill this weak ship which dies in one hit' to 'go have a dogfight with 10 ships that don't take any dmg from your weapons and all gang up on you and wreck you in two second, just so you can lose more money in the process'  There is this mind bogglingly stupid fuel system where you lose about a 4th of your fuel making jumps into new sections of space. Which sounds bad enough knowing you can't go more than two jumps out or you're stranded. But the worst part about it is you lose fuel just flying in empty sections of space as well.  So, in the end you have 3 jumps, one of which needs you be to your home system. Fear not though! For the low price of 1.25 cents worth of in game currency, you can transport back to the hanger! (it costs this much each time if you do it, no matter how far away you are)  The fast way home is to of course die, which drains your money obviously.  When this game was just pve missions and pvp quick play, I never felt like I needed to spend hours grinding or throw money at the game for success. But now it feels like I have an anchor attached to my ship.  Each gate is 10-20 km out from the last, and it takes a minute or two just to fly to each of them in a decent ship.  The missions only seems suited to tankier classes of ships as well so far, which means loss of fuel, loss of time, loss of fun.  I convinced myself to redownload this game just today, and I didn't quit the game because I didn't like it either, I had just moved on to other things after 80+ hours of play time. But now I'm finding it frustrating, confusing, and just generally a slog. Been in now for almost 3 hours, and the most fun I've had so far was looking at all of my old ships. Sadly 90% of them can't do diddly out in space anymore, and every single action I make prompts a pay option to win. (even an option to respawn out in the world for real life money as well)  I'm going to keep giving this a shot, but I gotta say, unless they take out this stupid fuel system, speed up travel time, add quick jumping, and stop punishing you every single time you die (TAKE OUT AMMO AND REPAIR COSTS YOU SADISTS) then I would tell you to just not play this.  Even the people who currently like this model have more money than brains, and I can just picture the devs rubbing their hands together in joy at all the microtransaction money.  500 dollars worth of DLC?

Then you'll set there for 20 minutes waiting for the game to try and pair you against another group of the same levels. And the enemy has to have a group that matches your group, not solitary players that happen to be playing at the same time. for example, if the enemy team is made of up 5 solitary players, your group won't get put into that game. Not unless at least two of those enemy players are in a group together that matches the levels of your group.   Also, you're allowed three people in a group or squad, but you cannot play PVP with a squad of three, only two.

This is how I vote this game: 4/5 - Graphic, look, interface 0/5 - Teamplay, Esport, pvp, balancement 1/5 - openplay, sandbox, custom content, api etc 0/5 - Premium content 0/5 - Community, friendship, wiki etc   + *ship improvements, upgrades etc *around 150 free ships *technology tree like in warthunder or world of tanks *free to play sci-fi space game (but without physics etc) *have Oculus Rift option, but I never tested it here *interface looks very nice   - *unfriendly for new players *if you are a new players, you will wait for over 30 minutes in queue for a single 3-5 minute match *from my account: 'time in game: 7days 22hours' and this 'time in battle: 2days 16hours' - 66% of time spent is just waiting for a match *most of ships looks very bad *phisics in this game doesn't exist *not esport friendly at all, and with that content and balancement will NEVER be! *lots of unbalanced content, I have over 85% win rate if I decide to pickup unbalanced ships+weapons, and those things weren't fixed for years, every update fked balancement more *braindead devs, im agree with that too (who dont?) *they wanted to make an awesome teamplay game, but they made an dynamicless campful games *luck of community made wiki etc, maybe becouse this game isnt worth it, volunteers wont made wiki for sth like this *very low amount of configuration options, you can't configure your hud except for few minimal things *open space is very, very bad. It isn't 'open' at all! *PVE missions are made without any nice idea *premium content is very unbalanced, many pay2win, with extremally sick prices, it's better to buy other game then 1 ship in this game *ships movement, manuvering etc is a joke, easy to learn but slow and annoying *very unfriendly pvp modes (read: braindead devs) *very monotony gameplay, this game doesnt grow, updates adds less then 1% of player's expectations *this game is full of vetarans whose accepted all those bad things *devs dont care about community, they only listening to few veterans",

However, those reasons might not bother you, and since its a free game, I highly encourage you to try it out for yourself, and make your own opinions.  On the three main reasons I gave Star Conflict a thumbs down.   The first reason, is being a new player sucks ♥♥♥. Now, don't get me wrong, a brand new player shouldn't have an 'optimized' character/ship, with all powerful stuff. I get that. But the AI is Insanely unfair. Just as an example, I was trying to fly a rank...I think it was a rank 6 ship (mid level ship). I was paired with someone who was flying a rank 12, so all the enemies were Double my level, and of course the AI has the best possible gear 'purple'. It actually was so bad I couldn't even drop an enemies shields below 80 percent, just because their ship was SO powerful compared to mine. So bad match making I guess, but in addition to that, for the most part, the 'general' chat is ignored. Meaning, as a new player, if you have a bunch of questions, try to find a forum or clan that helps new players, because realistically, your not going to find help. Again, to use an example, I've been trying to get a single question answered for the last three days, and been completely ignored in general chat. Not exactly condusive to new players. And the final nail in the coffin for this general point, is want to be good? Better set yourself in to read about 4-5 guides, because this game does NOTHING to explain itself to the player. What's good, what's bad, and so on? Nothing.   Point 2. Pay  to.....suck?  Now, I understand P2W games. I also understand how and why games sometimes choose to do this. And being completely honest, I usually take advantage of that. Because I have limited time I can actually sit and play games, but I like to play with friends, so typically I'll just put money into a game to 'keep up' with them. Star Conflict? Not the case. Bought ships are actually WORSE in the end then regular ships, meaning your forced to grind, and grind, and grind, and grind, and grind, and grind, and grind.....  Point 3. Now, not everyone is like this, but there are Toxic players in the pvp section of this game, but unlike most other games, these toxic types are usually the only ones to actually respond.   So to summerize, Very unfriendly for new players, really bad grinding/rng/time consuming, and Toxic/aggressive players that go out of their way to target new players. Those are the three general points that overall ruined Star Conflict for me. But hey, like I said, its a free game, give it a shot and try it for yourself.",

Until the most recent update that introduced Destroyers into the game it was relatively well balanced for those that took advantage of the F2P model against those that choose to pay for upgrades, various ships and what have you. Those days are over. This is now a complete P2W game (not the first and will not be the last). You have to have a lot of rare components in order to 'build' a destroyer, let alone upgrade the modules and weaponry. If you pay you can of course do this far in advance of those who choose to stick with the F2P offering of the game.  Overall I believe the game is (was) fun to play under the F2P model and still probably is if you are willing to put up the cash to keep up with the new class of ship. Otherwise, you will be fighting many losing battles against those who opened their wallets to have the better ships.",

The combat itself is actually very slick and well done, but the ship control it very annoying especially on frigates. You don't have to grind much at all thanks to the missions, but some of the missions are very missleading e.g. the leviathan mission I had no clue what to do at all and just gave up and never tried it again. Probably not worth spending money on, all it does it get you things faster rather than give you a better experience. Overall, not bad but needs sharpening up.

Like most FTP games it has a shop and without it you will grind for a long time to get good ships.

The complexities and the fun of this space combat build slowly through the levels, starting from a very high standard and getting better from there. There is an adequate crafting minigame and some half-baked questing. Optimizing the ship is made up of several minigames taken collectively. Optimization in its several pieces makes up a good, fun minigame.   There are areas of the game in need of improvement, yet the game as a whole is certainly in the top ten percent of space simulators. This review makes the case that Star Conflict is easily THE BEST f2p space combat simulator. We will not dwell on the shortcomings here, because the idea here is that you should just enjoy the game as it is at any given time and mostly let the devs worry about how to improve it. Overall, this is a great game.  If you are very diligent in researching the reviews, you will find many reviews that say, 'This game used to be great, but they ruined it.' These people are trying to help you, and they are giving you their honest opinion. But they are limited in focus to the particular changes that annoyed them, and in my opinion most of them would admit they are not really reviewing the game as a whole.  Here is the real reason for all the 'They ruined the game!' reviews: When the devs make something new, they want the community to step into the new material and try it out. Therefore, as it is in almost any game that has ongoing development, NEW STUFF IS ALWAYS OVERPOWERED. Once everyone has tried it, the devs scale it back into balance with the rest of the game. Some of the 'they ruined it' reviews are due to new stuff coming in overpowered, and some of these reviews are due to previously overpowered content finally being balanced with the rest of the game.  The game is living and evolving. This is a good thing! Your investment in this game will be rewarded with all kinds of new adventures, and the fun never stops. Yes, read all the reviews. But please understand the underlying reasons for the huge variety of reviews is a very good thing: a great game that grows and evolves over time. What are you waiting for?",

The flight and shooting mechanics I find to be very tight and responsive. Sound effects are spot on, very satisfying and visceral.  The downside is the progression system is extremely grindy if you don't spend real money. Its not so bad if you are enjoying the gameplay, but sadly despite having several pvp and even pve modes, one can get burnt out because the gameplay itself doesn't vary much. Aim your reticle at enemies, fire until they explode, rinse and repeat. There are plenty of modules to give different abilities to your ship, hull and shield repairs, additional weapons or drones, disables, and while they do add variety I find myself wishing for a broader spectrum of tools to use to liven up the gameplay after a while.  I do still greatly enjoy it. Nothing around that I'm aware of that scratches the same spacey dogfighting itch while also being accessible, populated, and beautiful. But do be aware that while the game does not have a hard pay wall, it does make progress difficult past tier 2 without at least a small investment.

            "review_text": "Star Conflict is a 3D PvP arcade space shooter made by Russian devs, with plenty of progression to go through, and a typically smooth difiiculty curve. It's been an excellent time sink for me, with a great concept with wonderful graphics (that still runs pretty nicely - with the exception of one map - on integrated graphics if turned down a tad) and a neat community that has its own quirks. As it's free, if anyone asked me whether or not to give it a go, I'd say absolutely. That's not that it doesn't have its problems, though.  Perhaps the worst of these is the blatant monetization. It was less apparent when I started, probably a combination both of more monetization as you progress and more monetization as time went on, but at this point, it's practically screaming for money. There's myriad kinds of in game currency, eight of which are free, and one of which is premium. The primary currency, credits, is earned by simply playing - neat enough. But six of the remaining require you to do certain tasks while playing, many of which are extremely difficult. Even if you do complete some, these tasks are then put on cooldown for some value of time between nothing - for the lowest paying ones - or 17 hours - for the highest. Complicating matters further, one can only earn two of these six at a time, and must pay roughly 20 minutes worth of credits to change which two - or skimp out and pay with premium. These six currencies are used to pay for certain equipment upgrades, which can also be skimped out on and paid with premium. The other free currency not yet talked about is perhaps the only one in abundance that doesn't really encourage anyone to skip out and pay with premium for.   The premium problem does go a bit further, yes, but not that much. There exist premium ships in the game, and while they typically have a slight advantage - easier progression, no upkeep fees, the tiniest of extra customization, get in the same queue as a slightly lower ranked free ship - they're not honestly that great. I've used one myself, and heard from several veteran players that they're not that much better, and in some cases, are even slightly worse than their free counterparts. Premium currency can be used for the things mentioned in the paragraph above, but those are mostly convenience fees, albeit 'convenience' in the sense of 'how it should have been done in the first place because the system is a tad bit too grindy for most people'. But perhaps the biggest travesty is that customization of ships - and I'm not talking about buying passive modules and such - is so ridiculous. To buy a colour, one must pay roughly a dollar's worth of real world money. Each ship has three colours, even, so to fully customize a ship, that's three dollars. Now, that might not sound ridiculous, but these colours do not transfer to any other ship, and if you wish to change the colour once and then back again, you'll have to pay to change it twice. Same deal for stickers. You can't simply 'unlock' a colour or a sticker, neither for your fleet nor for you ship, but must instead buy them on a per-instance basis.   Now, all that said, would I still recommend this game? Hell yes. Even if monetization is being pushed ridiculously hard, it's still a /good game/ at its core. There's no other game out there that makes use of the third dimension like this one. The mechanics are still wonderful as ever. My favourite part is that skill is valued over hardware, 90% of the time. There's both a casual base and a competitive base, so there's neither a push nor a restraint on getting better at the game. There's an official forum where the active community gets together and talks about the game, as well as whatever else. And asking for help gets you help, almost always.   tl;dr : The game is great on graphics, sound, mechanics, community, and originality. It's got huge problems on the monetization front, as well as some others not mentioned in the review (lack of tutorials, bad playerbase/dev communication, lag, newbie hunters, and community drama), but it's still a great game.",

            "review_text": "Played only for a while Enjoyed the undock option and going through portals and whatnot(was well done) PVE and Co-op was alright (in terms of gameplay and such) General gameplay pretty good, what kept me playing for a while. VERY optimized game, not balanced at all though.   Would not recomend it since it's big P2W game. I used to play this when it first came out and it was a lot of fun and more balanced than I thought it would be. But coming back to this a couple of years later it feels redundant and unbalanced, where as before it feelt like my skill had an impact on how well I peformed it now feels how much I've payed dictates that.   The fact that PVP always teams you up with people using destroyer class ships and can annihilate your ship with only one or two shots says something about PVP. Or the fact that people in co-op or PVE also kept doing the same thing. Don't get me wrong I played tons of the matchs and I always got first, second or third, except for PVP.   They all had something in common though, the top players would had max synergizied ships and annihilated everything in a couple of hits. This was either due to them having BOUGHT things to further their powers or matchmaking simply being awful and having no other choice then team you up with vetereans.   Either way Would not recomend this game. For this kind of game it feels like it should be possible for players to have somewhat of an effect even if they're free to play players based on their skill, manuevring and risk assesment. But it seems the devs takes the free to play idea in a ball and give the p2w bat to the buyers and lets them hit it out the arena in a homerun.   ",

What more is to say?  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Update on April 2nd; 2015: Maybe it is time to add something in response to some other so called reviews around here: There seem to be some players, who are talking about abusive admins etc. Since more than 1250 hours active game time I have seen not a single use of admin powers in terms of banning, let alone abuse. If you carefully read through those comments, they later all have to admit, that they were swearing, talking about drugs, using political names etc. For that, they got warnings and chat-mutes of a few hours. And now, we have some bad mooded kiddies who seek their revenge in negative comments.  I suggest: if you ARE interested in this kind of game, try it for free. If you later decide to spend money on a DLC or Premium, you can do so by a personal opinion. Until then, you can enjoy the game for free. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Well, apperantly a lot. First - like a lot of those games (War Thunder etc.) you need to invest some hours to learn the game mechanics and what ship is doing what. Second, you need some patience, as this game is more or less in constant development. Sometimes they make it better, sometimes they make it worse.   But, after all, it is free, and it generates a lot of fun. Especially, if you do it with a buddy or join one of the (better) corps (like clans) to play this together. There is PvP, PvE and an Open World Mode called Invasion (involves some Aliens).  There are Premium ships, but they have not more killing potential than other, normal ships - they just don't need repairs and generates some % more free synergy (to level your other ships). Hint: don't spend your real money for transferring this synergy, but if you want, invest it in a licence to get more loot.

            "review_text": "With the start of Season 2 and the exciting arrival of dreadnoughts for inter-corporation battles, I decided I would finally write a review for this awesome game, to which I have devoted a large part of my life for the past year (you decide if that is a good thing or a bad thing ;) ).   First of all, why is it a good game?      Beautiful graphics: ships maps and backgrounds (tip: press Alt+H in-battle to remove the HUD)     PVP, PVE and Invasion (open world) game modes     Large variety of maps in all game modes     Hundreds of fully customisable ships, with many different types of modules     Corperations - the game's clans system     It's  FREE TO PLAY !!! and definitely not pay to win - all premium ships only offer small advantages over their non-premium counterparts, if any at all     What is wrong with the game?  (it has to be mentioned, despite my love for the game...)     Fairly small matches in higher tiers     Low population on anything other than EU/RU prime time     High ping for US pilots on RU servers and vice versa     High grind, but hey? who want a game you can complete in two days? Also there are plenty of ways to reduce grind by using real money, if that is what you are looking for.     Previously I would have said lack of communication on the dev's behalf, but this seems to have changed recently     Difficulty to get matches in squads, since with the current system, a squad of the same size as yours has to queue up also, before you can get into a match.     Some tips for someone trying the game for the first time:      Please try the game until tier 3 (ranks 7-9) at least. This will give you the best overall view of the game, as t3 is where you get the largest PVP matches, and where most of the intercorporate tournaments happen.     Join a corp as soon as you reach t2/t3, and ask around for a corp that uses voice comms. You can easily find one on the forum. Joining a corp will help you make friends, and make the most out of the game. They can give you advice, ship builds, squad with you, and just generally have a good laugh together!     The forum has a lot of information. Get involved! Ask questions and the game's veterans will be glad to help you! (maybe your thread will turn into a huge off-topic debate, but that's another matter...)     Try all ship types from all factions, before you choose your favourites. They all have very different playing styles!     PVE can be very useful to gain credits rapidly, while PVP is better for synergising (levelling-up) your ships.     Watch out in Invasion, there are pilots like mysself lurking around ;) If you just want to farm bots, don't forget to put your station protection on before undocking. Also don't forget that certain zones have no station protection.    I look forward to meeting you on the battlefield! GL and may the biomorphs leave you unmolested!",

If War Thunder and Fractured Space had a baby it would be this. Read on if you want some quick basic info about it that i think its all the main stuff.  The Good:   Its just really enjoyable to play for a free to play its great, not sure about the pay 2 win as of yet because i've only had 3 games. But so far it doesn't feel unfair i've not even leveld up yet.   Controls are simple but may be a bit odd to some The controls are similar to Strike Vector. Its a bit weird for the first minute or so but it works really well.   Dog fighting in this is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. The Rush having to go invisible to find a safer place to recover while your shields low. Its just awesome especially with an extra wide set up whether 21:9 or eyefinity custom res side by side on two or three monitors.  I can actually play this game in eyefinity mode across two monitors without the bezel in the middle annoying the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.  Manufactoring seems kinda cool you learn things, then process things and use things and i think you can sell them too for extra cash thingies in the game. What ever the blue stuff is.  Even your moms laptop should run this alright i get great fps with the settings turned up and my pc is running a R9 270x 2gb which is like a £120 gpu. (well more for mine because its an asus directcu ii top so that was 180 with bf4 a game i dont play).   The Bad:  Main Menu is a cluster ♥♥♥♥ full of all sorts of stuff you can't be arsed reading and looking into. But having said that the manufacture thing seems to make sense so far i've only done one item so far.  The time it takes to connect to a game. Over 5mins to join the same game with the same people. what the ♥♥♥♥ is up with that?   Some of the stuff doesn't make sense or it does but i'm just not figuring it out properly. I dont get the crew system thing for example. For some it will be a jump in and you'll understand it all for others it may be a wtf does that mean?  Other stuff:  People are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about abusive admins here in the comment section. Personally I have no idea i've had like 3 games with the same people in a row. Takes like 5mins to connect but it might be the time of day that i'm playing or maybe people don't play it anymore. I dont know if it is few dedicated servers or what.  All in all Definately Worth a try. Its Free it wont hurt to have a different experience, you'll either like it, dislike it or hate it i'm just simply stating my thoughts about it. Its fun its gripping at times flying through asteroid fields during a team match that involves dying less than the other team due to reinforcement waves. The Domination matches. It Looks awesome and is even more awesome when the action gets really intense. Also it doesn't require an amazing computer to run this. This much fun this nice pretty graphics and its free. What more can you want? There is a few irritating things like trying to time your cool down timers correctly for using flares or you wanna jump in a game quickly and your stuck connecting for 5+mins and then to find out oh hey the games almost over so you have to go through all that again. It does need more servers. But for what you get the game is pretty solid does a good job is fun pretty and easy to get the hang of.   give it an 8/10   I feel like it would be a 9 if it was a more simplified cleared up main menu page and the game had a proper ingame voice over tutorial to explain to you what the stuff on the menu is and how you get it. I personally don't like clustered menus. It gets a bit confusing and servers are a pain in the ♥♥♥. The wait times are terrible and that is a huge deal breaker as it can lead to less time actually playing the game. I feel like it doesn't quite do enough to make the 10 it could do with more ships, more cosmetics and stuff for free to play users. Like pimping out the ships a bit with maybe neons or something would be cool just to give it that me more personalization (if thats even a word).  Just play it. Do the tutorial to figure the controls then just jump straight in a battle you'll see how much fun it is.

There is PvP, with various different modes PvE, with various co-op missions And there is an open world with savezones and free for all zones  You can chose your ship and upgrade or replace weapons or special abilities on your ship.  Tier based, yes, meaning you'll have to play with one ship to advance onwards towards other ships, but there is usually enough to keep you bussy while you progress.  You really don't have to pay to play, all that will acomplish is more rewards for acomplishments, making you progress faster.  In my opinion, absolutely recommand for any sci-fi lover.",

I still have quite a bit to learn in order to conquer the game. I play on an HP Beats Edition laptop, and I maintain usually 45 fps in game.  One of the only cons I can think of is that the tutorial does not show you how to play with the controller, BUT, it is pretty easy to guess AND you can look at your key bind options in the main menu and customize them the way you want (the only controller key I had to set that it needed was lock-on, which I set to left D-pad).

Tons of flight controls, but suprisingly easy to learn, and although it looked cpu heavy, it was rather nice to the lower end computers. I can't tell you the number of times i was riding just 2 feet away from a structure, riding so close to it in order to make my chaser trip up or when you narrowly avoid everyone riding your behind with one well timed defensive active ability and some creative manuver. However, it clearly has degraded into a truely pittiful game. It use to be a very actiony game, where your skills, guts, timing, and location mattered more then any gun or ship you accually used. Bahh, now it has degraded into such a pay to play pithole, where the opposite is true. Dam, I don't know what all went wrong over that one year, but i can smell that something has, be it different (and incompetent) management, or this was there original plan from the begining. Use to be one of the most fun games ever, now it's borderline trash.",

There is a very big grind element to the game once you get to the higher levels as the cost of ships increases drastically as you progress.

What holds me loyal to the game is not just the fancy graphics or the cool customizable ships, but the fun, fast-paced gameplay and amazing PvE missions that you can go out on. You can go from defending allied territory to taking down a massive alien dreadnought with a team of your stronest friends. After that you can cool off by flying around in the open world and fighting other players or AI enemies. You can gather resources and craft powerful weapons and modifications for your ships, and when you obtain a high enough rank you can even craft your own custom ship that you can outfit however you like! I really adore games with serious customization, but I seriously love this game's ship models. Every single ship is a work of art and they only get better as you go. It takes a while to gain traction in this game, but once you do, it will be more rewarding than ever.  Please, please keep playing the game beyond the first week or so. After you get moving and start getting more powerful ships and weapons and modules the game world opens up in so many ways. The start just sucks a little. ^^",

            "review_text": "  Had the game for a few days now and I'm really enjoying it. The ships play their roles well, the missions are interesting as you unlock them, the game looks great...   The amount of time it takes and how many times you have to repeat the same missions in the same starter ships to get out into open space almost turned me away. While I love PvP and PvE in the game, the ability to undock and poke around before you have 10 hours in would have helped a little.   The factions don't seem to really have much point other than design and the extent of universe to explore outside is kinda limited.   It would be nice to be able to take a more Galaxy On Fire approach to travel. Hopping around from station to station picking up work instead of always killing and collecting for the same people.   As far as a space shooter goes. It's good. It's fun. You can manufacture new massive ships, explore space for parts and work together with friends to get things done. It's nice to pull a small squadron together with a couple fighters and a support frigate.   Solid recommendation for a pretty solid game that won't eat your entire life away.",

            "review_text": "This game was fun, addictive, and... well... like almost every other game thats out there. This games, back when it was good, brought an old concept into new light. When people fought in teams, they fought together as a team. Everyone knew what to do and they would do it in the smartest and, mostly, risk free fashion. People would group together and use each other's abilities to overcome the other team. When someone was in danger of being overtaken 2v1, others would help that person out and push the other team back. Victory felt well desurved and defeat kept you pushing for more. I admit there were problems with the game before, but it was still fun despite. Teamwork was what made the game fun. The game has been change almost completely since then. 'change is good,' some might say, but with change comes new problems. The game gives people too much power. Strategy isn't what it is anymore. People lack weakness and planning is almost out of the picture. For example: when there was a 'tank' that was much more powerful than the rest, the smaller ships would either distract or damage 'the tank' so the other ships could destroy 'the tank' while its weak. That 'tank would deploy counter-measures or bring a few friends along with him to stop these attacks. Most matches now, people will go off on their own or in small squads, and ignore the rest of the team. Now, the problem everyone is talking about: real world cash for ingame money. This game was heading into this direction from the start, but its hit the point of utter annoyance. From over-powered moduals and weapons, to even just wanting to change you name. Sure, if you cram you can get anything without paying for it, but for somethings that would take years. This game was great before, but, like everything I've explained, this has changed. The developers have spent so much time trying to add to the game that they forgot to fix the problems. I wish I could say something good about the game, but with every groundbreaking improvement is an equaly annoying and ruinous problem.",

There doesn't appear to be many players on or nobody at the lower tiers so it took most of a day before I could even get in a PVP game and even then all but 4 players of the 16 were bots.

            "review_text": "I have very mixed feelings about this game, and the only reason I'm giving it thumbs down is that it seriously lacks consistency. It has a lot of potential and I hope they'll introduce some interesting goals and more variety to it, becayse in current state it's simply too grindy and outright boring.  After couple hours I feel burned out. All the ships seem like differently colored rehashes of same thing we flew before, just with boosted stats. At first, when you play tutorial and quite fun promissing PvE option, you get the general idea of how Star Conflict is supposed to look. Interceptors are fast and hard to hit, but fragile, gunships are your heavy punchers, and frigates are designed to bring some serious firepower to the frontline being able to withstand some punishment... ...but the moment we get into PvP this notion goes to absolute ruin. That is because higher ranked players overall have access to equipment with vastly superior stats, meaning you'll spend long minutes sitting on their tail scraping Hit Points with your puny gun, but it often takes three shots to turn your frigate into a flaming husk within a second or two. Unlike with War Thunder, where vehicle and equipment stats are just an cherry on a cake (of your presonal skill) here it's complete oposite. It's all about upgrades, more dps, more energy, more stats, stats, stats and unfortunately it feels more like two metal boxes exchanging stats between eachother.  As I wrote there is plenty of ships, sadly most of them are slightly altered models (or not altered at all) of ships we've seen before already, thanks god they have different paintjobs! Upgrade costs are simply horrendous and tier progress it tiring, with a complete lack of interresting content. Game looks AMAZING, the graphic engine is top notch, ship design is perfect, they do look like warmachines and not flying dildoes, like in so many Space-Sims. I love the physics which deals with innertial and thus flight model doesnt feel like planes in Space, but actual spaceships. If only INTERFACE was up to par. The main problem is that in game, where you get into the thick of battle, when all the flashes, explosions, muzzleblasts, thrusters, laser-beams and shiny pulse projectile go across your screen you have NO WAY of telling where the heck is your crossair! It's a tiny cross, two bars, each about half a milimiter thick just vanish in the chaos before your eyes. You can't tell what you're shooting at...  I love the immersion factor for what little we've seen so far. The factions are fun, ships have unique feel and style, spacestations are a neat idea, it's just... there's not enough 'fun' to keep me playing. PvE Co-Op was great Idea, doing missions with my friends, flying in organized wings and such, but the moment I went into PvP it sadly turned into a typical World of Stats(tanks)/(in SPACE), an extremely repetitive grindfest, where lower rank players are pretty much free frags, with little to do. And when you get to higher ranks you pretty much wipe everything on the map with little effort. What's then? Grind for a box with better stats? Till you can beat other boxes with higher stats? Grinding for sake of getting a better vehicle to do more grinding and yet better vehicle, and so on, and so on...   We are given three factions to choose from, but what's their purpose other than different starting ships? You can fly any faction ship you want anyway, there is no real conflict between them and for most those factions are used to paint the galaxy map somehow in clan-wars, because no other idea seemed valid, I guess. We don't get to explore the factions, they are just there, a symbol that literary means nothing. It is a false pretense we deal with fleshed out setting, in fact factions are nothing more then another grind table masked as a reputation system to unlock 'bigger' stats technology.... You know, so we can get exactly same gun we used to shoot for last week, just with little more damage per second. It feels like in current state, this game is just a load of mechanics that seem interesting at first, but boil down to even more grind, and more, and more, and more grind.  Don't get me wrong, this game has GREAT potential, it simply feels like it lacks direction and variety. At current shape and form it get's boring fast, extremely fast! It's hard find reason to support microtransaction system where there's little purpose to keep on playing.  Thus, for now, it's Thumbs Down, but I do hope devs (who proved that are capable) can one day introduce new ideas and make the gameplay more interesting.",

            "review_text": "Very few games prompt me to write a review. Truth be told I'd rather be playing them than writing about them. With this review I really wanted to get across my experiences of the game.  A lot of other reviewers have bad mouthed this game going as far as to write discussions stating the game is robbing players. How????? When its free to play I don't know.   Star Conflict is space ship fighting game (I can't think of a better description) it isn't heavily focused on simulation nor is it overly arcade style. For me it hits a sweet spot in between. It combines elements for a lot of different games in order to give the player a fantastic choice for how they wish to progress in the game. There are PVP battles, PVE, space exploration, missions, special events and a persistent galactic map that corporations can fight over territories to control.  So many people have stated that the game is pay to win, which in my opinion couldn't be further from the truth. Yes you can pay for 'Premium', the only advantage this gives you is you get more experience and money at the end of a battle. Your ships aren't better, your components aren't better. All paying for the game does is mean you can level faster. Even without premium though you can still level at god rate where it feels less like a grind and more that you are getting somewhere. I've played many games WoT, WoWS plus many others and I feel with Star Conflict the rate of progression is much nicer. As an added bonus if you work on levelling the ships to thei max you get an across the board experience boost that applys to everything. I've yet to play a game myself that does this.  I find it frustrating that so many people bad mouth the fact that you can pay for this game. A key point that it seems a lot of gamers forget is, games don't come for free and developers don't create something just for the enjoyment of others. A game is designed to make money, if a game doesn't make money why are the developers going to spend their time at work doing something for nothing. I could argue about this forever but that isn't what this game is about.  Star Conflict has a fantastic array of ships, modules, weapons all of which allow you to customise your ship to suit your play style and if your a team player, complement your team. There is a huge variety of ships each with their own unique role, playing a ship in the role it was intended not only makes it far more effective but as a pilot you become an integral part of your team.   There are 3 main factions in the game each with their own distinct ship style, Empire ships have small shields but great armour, Federation ships are a balance between armour and shields, Jericho are biased more towards shields. As well as the wide variety of modules available you also can further tailor your play style through your ground crew, which give your bonus's to your ships. You pick an 'Implant' per level which acts like a perk, buffing certain aspects of your ship be it shields or weapons or modules. This means that you can really pick and choose which traits suit your playstyle the best and work for you.  There is so much to do in the game that after 70 hours I'm still finding more and more things to do.  The biggest drawback to this game is that it needs much more support, there is a great player base, but having more people would make this game truly epic. The devs actually seem to listen to the players and what they want. In game polls pop up periodically asking for the gamers points of view on potential features. Whats even better just for clicking you get given 'GS' the in game currency you buy for money.  There are a plethora of premium ships you can buy, but you don't have to, they aren't better than the main ships. Their biggest benefit is an increased reward for playing them, nothing else.   I really like this game and would recommend to anyone to try it. Its free, give it a go and see if you like it. If you do join a corporation as soon as you can, its well worth it. Having experienced pilots around you can make a really big difference.",

            "review_text": "On me: Over 2000 hours in game, 4500 matches, all ships played and maxed, build a corp from scratch to 150 members and top-10 PvP leaderboards, organized and played dreadnought matches. Considering myself a casual player - can take on almost anyone on a good day, or die like a newb on a bad one.  On the Game: Great, addictive game. Maybe the best space combat game currently on the market. Spaceships, fights, PvE &amp; PvP, open space, pirates, aliens, missions, ship customization, great graphics, low requirements, linux &amp; mac support - everything you want from a space combat game and much more. Also much more mature than most other space combat offerings on Steam, and far more dynamic and interesting than e.g. Elite:Dangerous. Basically it's War Thunder in Space.  Try it, it's free, and up to the mid-tiers the grind is moderate (and mid-tiers are much more fun than high-tiers anyway). If you have the time and patience to improve your gameplay to competitive levels, this may be a game worthy of long-term engagement.   As reference: without investing any real cash, it will take you about 100-150 matches to maximize all Tier-1 ships. With licence etc. it will take 3000 to 5000 matches to maximize all ships in the game, if that is your goal.  However, you need the frustration tolerance of a tibetan monk after Tier-1:  - Matchmaking is super-broken and will put new players with 100 matches against unbeatable veterans with 10'000. Often. And in every Tier (except 1). Only thing worse than 'normal' matchmaking is squad matchmaking - the only balancing there is the amount of players in squads to be near-equal. The game doesn't even try to match based on skill or experience - I've seen squads with 300 matches total placed against squads with 30'000 matches total. Matchmaking generally feels worse than random - it seems the goal is to frustrate players on purpose, to get them to buy 'better' stuff and spend more money on the game. Newer players complaining about the frustrating game experience are told to simply 'gid gud', as if every casual player had the intention to spend 2 years of his life in the game.   - Tiers are supposed to be skill-related, but that is not the case. There are just as many new players in T5 as there are experienced veterans. Lower Tiers (T2/3) are chock-full of uber-leet veteran players and - even worse - elite kill squads 'seal-clubbing' / 'farming' newer players for easy wins which yield stats and Iridium for the corp.  - A lot of the vet no-lifers are extremely abrasive, insulting other players at every opportunity. The vets basically 'own' the game (or at least act as if they did), and vet squads and corps dominate the whole gaming experience. Newer players (anyone with less than maybe 3'000 matches) are treated as cannon fodder. This, together with the disgusting matchmaking, greatly contributes to extremely high player fluctuation in the mid-tiers and an environment very unfriendly towards casual players. Woe upon the newer player daring to use the same OP builds and tactics as the veterans. For example, it's OK if you're getting killed by OP vet drone pooping tacklers 20 times in a row, but if you so much as dare using a drone in your interceptor, be prepared for a veritable ♥♥♥♥♥torm.   - The whole 'Dreadnought' match experience is a huge hassle and pretty repetitive. Timeslots are limited, setup horribly complicated, and strategic sector gains are basically reserved for the vet corps due to the inherent mechanics.  - Testing of changes is reserved to/done by some of the vet players, which in turn leads to major and minor changes which generally favour the veteran player community.  - Veteran players incessantly ask for more advertising to get more players (more lambs for the slaughter), not realizig that this game's primary issue is not gaining new players, but to retain those who give the game a try. I have led a major corp for some time, and the speed in which the game is bleeding players due to frustration is absurd (about 2% each day).  Over 1.2 million players have tried this game. Only about 2k play it concurrently, maybe around 7k over the course of a week. Less than 100 vets 'own' the game. Are you the one out of 10'000 that can stand the frustration and has the skill and time to make it into their ranks?  If not, give this a spin for a great casual game experience - until it's your time to rage-quit.  12/10 as Space combat game 7/10 when taking matchmaking and balancing into consideration",

So you get matched with players of your rank or a rank higher, thus unbalancing the game, basically the team with better ships pretty much always wins; but that's not the worst about it, the worst part is that this game follows a system of ship classes, and the outcome of a match highly depends on players choosing a proper class according to the rest of the team, but that NEVER HAPPENS because everyone is focused on leveling up their ships, ignoring any competitiveness the game might have.  Conclusion: There's a great idea behind this game, but it has been awfully developed and it's not worth anyone's time.",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty good for the reasons I will list now. Lets kick off my review.  ====Gameplay==== The gameplay is quite awesome, teeming amounts of frigates, fighters, and interceptors, all desperately trying to complete their objective. While you are either hanging back and providing firepower in your frigate, or hunting down every last enemy with an interceptor under your command.  ====Community==== The community is nice, but it is impossible to coordinate attacks. They all have their own motives and completely ignore anything told to them, this makes strategy not an option. The only way to actually be coordinated is if you are calling someone on steam or skype, some kind of internet voice chatting program. But thats it.  ====Mechanics==== There are a few main mechanics you need to get a handle for until you can get good at this. I will list them now. ---Controls--- The controls are pretty simple, easy to get a handle on, but not so easy you can fly blindfolded with one arm tied behind your back. It is a perfect balance between mouse controls and keyboarding. ---Ships--- This is a pretty big part of the game, there are three main types of ships and a bunch of minor types for those. I will only go into the main ones. Frigates, fighters, and interceptors. Frigates pack big firepower but are slow with heavy armor and shielding. Fighters are a balance between speed and firepower, able to go toe-to-toe with a lot of things, even frigates if played correctly. Interceptors are very fast, and good for taking out fast moving things to keep them from getting in the zone where frigates cant shoot and tearing them up. ---Hull and Shielding--- These are two simillar things so I will knock them both out at once. Your shields protect your hull and they recharge. When your hull hits zero you are as dead as a can of Spam, and hull wont recharge. ---Items and Abilities--- Two more simillar things, yay! Items are disposable things that can only be used a few times per life. Then you die and get 'em back, simple as that. Abilities can be used as many times as you want but usually have a cooldown.  ====Overview==== So all in all, this is a pretty awesome game. But fix that whole coordination thing by adding voice chat or making designated squads at the beginning of a fight. And also, I would love to see a dreadnought as a playable ship in the game. They would have so much potential as heavy hitters or being able to dock fighters for repairs.",

Despite all the 'Pay-to-win' screaming around the community, and sore losers that you find everywhere, (meaning not just in Star Conflict), this game is actually quite worthwhile to pick up if you're looking for a quick space combat game to kill time. Yes, the Grinding can be an issue some days, but it's not enough to keep me from playing the game, obviously.  However, WITHOUT paying cash, there are still plenty of ways to get around those issues. One new mode, added before I wrote this, allows you to easily grind in Player Versus AI PvP style battles to earn fairly easy synergy and credits. Sure, the quantity is lower, but that's acceptable considering how much easier the bots are than actual human pilots.  To repeat a certain point: This game, I don't care what anyone says, is not a Pay-to-Win game. Any money I put into it was by choice. I did not at any point feel like I HAD to pay cash to advance or outfit my ships, unlike what people screaming 'Pay-to-win' are trying to say.  Cosmetic options for free DO exist, usually as event rewards, but I don't think cosmetic customization is NECESSARY to the game itself to feel fun. I think the cost of doing so is fairly justified. Could it be lower? Sure, but it is not necessary, nor are the cash upgrades or premium ships to make this game a good bit of fun.  Sure, I may not have maximum tier ships, or all Mk. 4 equipment, but I have been paying this game for long enough to make the judgement that skill as a pilot is VERY important. Sure, an Mk. 4 cannon can do more damage, but why worry about that if you can outsmart and outmaneuver your opponent. Fly well, and you don't get hit.  I want to share a bit from one battle I had so everyone can understand HOW skill based this game actually is versus what people are constantly screaming about it.  Combat recon: My corporation was running a skirmish. Both of our captains had been defeated, so it was essentially a deathmatch. I was flying an interceptor (not sure which one exactly, but irrelevant, seeing as how it was not a premium ship.) and I was the last player on my team, and there were five of the enemy team left. I managed to avoid getting hit by weapons long enough to take out three of them by myself, again, no premium equipment, just some crazy stunts and years of Freelancer (Yes, that 13-year-old game.) skills mixed with adrenaline and mentally screaming 'I'm not going down yet!' until my interceptor was finally destroyed.  'Sure, that's just a story' you might say. Well, you should give the game a shot sometime and you might have an epic battle like that someday. Fly Well, Fly Free",

            "review_text": "Star Conflict is by far at the top of any free-to-play games I've ever tried. It's fast-paced, quick-to-learn but hard to master game with great emphasis on skill. As all free-to-play games, the game has a lot of premium content, including unique maxed-out premium ships, but everything else is available to all players, including vast choice of weapons and active/passive modules for each ship. Most of the premium features affect how quickly you can level up the ships (gain synergy), which also happens to be the threshold for gaining access to new ships.  The Ships and Factions are well thought-out and balanced, and although you choose a faction in the start, you're not limited in anyway to that, but can instead switch factions on the fly. What matters is the ships you choose. Factions have different ships, which all follow the basic classification system between Interceptor, Fighter and Frigate, but each faction has its own core variant with unique special abilities and stat variation, with some occasional cross-over. The balance is overall very good, and with vast selection of weapons and active/passive modules, you have a very good and considerably meaningful customization options throughout the game.  I thoroughly recommend Star Conflict to space sim fans. For guilds, there's also corporate-only sector warfare, which is Star Conflict's endgame. You can also play PvE in co-op, though the missions currently lack variation and are good only for better cash. Other than that, I'd hoped the game would have a proper newtonian flight model, but even as it is, the experience is very enjoyable, with lot of room for tactcs and skill.",

Very simple learning curve as opposed to the very steep curve of Elite: Dangerous. The controls are easy to pick up, I've started with the mouse and keyboard as I didn't see an option to use the joystick until a couple of hours in. Highly recommend this game if you're into space flight sims and like me are waiting for Star Citizen. I am only a couple of hours in and already I'm resisting the urge to throw some real money at it to get some early upgrades for my ships but will keep plotting along for now completing missions.  PvP games were taking me about 6 minutes in a queue and even then it half filled the game with bots. This is ok as it's better than waiting longer than that for real players when potentially there's just none on in my time zone (GMT+8). I found i was connected to South Asia i think and i didn't notice any lag. The players i did play against were good and although it looked like they may have had better ships/items, i still killed them as many times as they killed me, often finishing top of the leaderboard for that game.  The repetitiveness of the pvp matches is balanced with pve missions that gain experience with your chosen faction - i went with the Empire. Am looking forward to doing more contracts for them and gaining reputation for good rewards/upgrades. I haven't dabled too much into the workshop/crafting but i can see some potential there after looting a few crafting components and having the ability to craft items. Am saving them for now though as the upgrades are easy to obtain so far.  Am looking forward to putting some more hours into the game this week, especially with some friends picking up the game too. Highly recommend for fans of space flight sims.",

This is at its heart a very fun game that you can easily get into. But...it shares traits of other F2P games of this nature.  THE GRIND  THE MATCHMAKER  THE UNFAIRNESS  First of all, the grind: PvP can be quite unforgiving at first, you will constantly be killed whilst barely touching enemy ships. I ask, for the sake of Star Conflict's future, do something, anything, about the unfairness in the game. I've been trying to level up my Fox but all the battles are giving me rank 5-6-7. PvE is killing me with rank 9. Fox is a rank 4. Its like World of Tanks but worse! I know that the player base is at its best, not very big. At least from my perspective. PvP will grant 2-3 minutes wait time. 1 minute if your lucky. PvE usually around 2-3 minutes. Rare luck for a minute.  Suggesting to the Developers: try to concentrate on the player base before trying to make the game look good and great. Because its the gameplay that will ultimately be important and people are looking at the gameplay, and not the looks. Sure it looks good, but how does it play? If it was next-gen graphics, awesome, but it plays like crap. Its gone. Great game and keep up the work. Looking for improvements for new-player experience.",

There are hacks that obviously boost the resistances or increase the weapon's damage. And the best thing is: The Game Masters are active players in the Corporations (guilds) the cheaters play for.   When I participated a steam forum thread about cheating in Star Conflit and talked about these issues, the Star Conflict team just closed the thread. Because ignoring a problem is MUCH better than fixing it (*irony off*)   I hope the developer will finally stop ignoring this issue and starts putting some effort to ban hackers because Star Conflict is a great game with lots of possibilities.",

But the more I play Star Conflict, the more I liked him. To fly in space, on his ship, which he set up how you want. Put different modules, weapons. Improve them. For a small price you can even decorate the ship. Very fast development, personally I don't see how to change ships. Game currency accumulates rather quickly, while you pumped one ship, have time to save up for next. Playing in a platoon much more interesting than one, so it is better to start or friends, or to find partner in the game. However 'students' there's quite a few, actually as elsewhere. And generally very cool idea and execution, and planes, tanks, it's all there. By the way go play can free. 10/10  (Русский) Начало очень напоминает танки как я могу их сравнивать&gt;_&lt; Похожая система развития, такими же ветвями искусства. Но чем больше я играю в Стар конфликт, тем больше он мне нравился. Летать в космосе на своем корабле, который он создал, как вы хотите. Ставить разные модули, оружие. Улучшить их. За небольшую цену вы даже можете украсить корабль. Очень быстрое развитие, лично я не вижу, как менять корабли. Игровая Валюта накапливается довольно быстро, пока вы прокачиваете один корабль, успели накопить на следующий. Играя во взводе намного интереснее, чем одному, поэтому лучше начать или друзей, или найти партнера в игре. Однако 'студентам' есть довольно много, собственно как и везде.

Another thing is it's matchmaking system. It took me 10:12 minutes (over an estimated 5:00) to find a rank 1-3 pvp match that really wasn't pvp. The match (I'm guessing for the abscense of players) had 3-4 bots on each team and only 2-3 non-AI players (and even then most the players just went after the bots completely oblivious to the dastardly human mind).

I unstalled the game for several months until now. I reinstall the game and see the game in pretty much the same shape that i left it in.

It's a fun game, but a little imbalanced when it comes to what ship you're flying and what ship is shooting at you. It makes sense though, because an tackler should be able to take down a gunship easily, and a gunship should be able to destroy an interceptor pretty quickly.  I'm a little upset on how the frigates work though. It takes a good amount of time before you get your first damaging frigate, and even then it's expensive to arm it with the weapons you wish to take into battle.  If anyone is familiar with the World of Tanks series, then you know how most of the game works.  Two teams composed of pilots flying different ships playing in one of the gamemode types. You choose what ships you want to take into battle, three at the most. If you leave the battle, then those three ships become locked until the end of the battle. There is a respawn in the control beacon game mode, but there is no respawn in search and destroy or any of the other arena style gamemodes.  After all of this though, I still enjoy flying a frigate into a swarm of fighters and winning against all the odds. If that's not you then you'd probably be interested in flying an interceptor capable of in-battle warp jumps, or a tackler that uses a beam to slow ships and paint them for extra damage. All in all it's a really fun game when you know what you're doing.",

            "review_text": "This game is a nice blend of CoD and EVE Online. A quick and consise tutorial gets you into the game real fast. I can see myself sinking quite a number of hours into this one. Love the fact that it is native on Linux and it's Free to Play, not Free to Win. While it is possible to spend a good amount of real money and deck out you ship(s), at the same time, there is quite a bit of skill involved during actual combat, so you won't be dominated by someone who has spent $100 but has no experience in-game. Also, if you're worried about being a newbie and jumping into a match only to be constantly killed and frustrated, there are a number of PvE levels to play that offer nice rewards, which will then allow you to deck out your ship(s) before diving into PvP territory. Haven't had a chance to check out the corporations yet, but that appears to be a nice bit of endgame once you've reached a really high level, have a strong grasp on the game, and you have all three (or four) ship slots filled with decent equipment and such.  I would highly reccomend this game for sci-fi nerds like me, and those who enjoy Call of Duty, EVE, or even the Wing Commander series... In fact, when I first got in-game, I was having some flash-backs of Tie Fighter (the Jericho faction is very remenicent of the Sith).",

(the idea of limiting purchaseability of paid items in F2P game is worth Economics Ig Nobel Prize, honestly) Oh, barely forgot. You won't unlock all Steam achievements without purchasing at least one ship for real money. Ain't that cute? 2. Game mechanics. Rocket launchers and torpedoes rule. Is your ship tough as nails? Suck it, one guided missile in your side and you're done! Lasers, ballistics guns, stealth devices, crowd control devices - nothing of it needed if you can just spam rockets. 3. Bots. Bots everywhere. The game itself is all about quick skirmishes between small squads. Each botter present diminishes team's chances way too seriously.",
