            "review_text": "The Deus Ex series has been in a league of its own since its debut back in the year 2000, vividly painting an engaging cyberpunk world riddled with conspiracies and terrorism. The series had a rebirth in 2011 with Human Revolution, introducing greatly upgraded mechanics and visuals to deliver one of the most intense adventures the series had offered up to that point. With five years having passed it’s time to continue protagonist Adam Jensen's journey in what is the most dark and grim entry in the series yet with Mankind Divided.  The story in Mankind Divided continues directly on from the last game, with two years having passed since the ‘Aug Incident’ – when everyone with a robot body part was sent into a murderous rage. There’s a handy recap video you can watch before you start the game, that goes over the finer details, but the aftermath is pretty much what you’d expect. Augmented people have become social outcasts and there’s now what the game refers to as a ‘mechanical apartheid’. But while the set-up is interesting, the plot is surprisingly small in scale and impact.  The game takes place two years after the events of Human Revolution, with that game’s catastrophic ending that resulted in augmented people being manipulated to go on a killing spree that resulted in the deaths of millions of people setting the stage for this game. There’s a handy recap video you can watch before you start the game, that goes over the finer details, but the aftermath is pretty much what you’d expect.  The world is now in turmoil as naturals no longer trusts augmented people, which has lead to their segregation as a result of the new Human Restoration Act. Augs have all been rounded up and are forced to exist in a cramped and heavily-guarded ghetto away from naturals as a means of cooling down the rising tension, and the morality of that decision serves as the spine of this game’s narrative.  Since recovering from his injuries at the end of Human Revolution, Adam Jensen enlists as the only aug counter-terrorist field agent in Task Force 29, a newly-formed special division in Interpol whose base is hidden beneath a quaint shop in Prague. While a part of his motivation is to genuinely dismantle terrorist cells around the world, Jensen's overarching goal is to gain intelligence and snuff out the Illuminati who have been controlling world events behind the scenes. This means secretly sending information to Alex Vega, his point of contact with the hacktivist group Juggernaut Collective, who has the best chance of figuring out who the real players are.  Where the story is successful is in its ability to juggle and weave multiple complex and modern themes together: legalized oppression, police corruption, propaganda, gang warfare, and corporations that hold so much political power that they're above the law. Exploring the crowded streets of Golem City and the multiple districts of Prague, especially near the end of the game, you'll come face-to-face with police brutality and harassment as well as extreme prejudice by most of the non-augmented citizens in the game.  By the fourth time Jensen is stopped by an officer who wants to see his papers, you'll likely groan and be frustrated for losing yet another ten seconds of your life—which is the point. The environmental and contextual storytelling, mainly told through the numerous emails, side missions, and Pocket Secretaries you'll read, is excellent.  Jensen’s intentions to stop further terrorism plays out similarly to they did in Human Revolution, which is through the mechanics of a first-person action game. Jensen once again has a vast array of weapons and augmentation powers to choose from, which allows him to take down enemies head on, sneak around them stealthily, hack his way through enemy tech to turn against them, and even occasionally avoiding confrontations by talking it out. The game always gives you plenty of options in terms of how you want to go about tackling its various missions, and each is rewarding in its own way.  However, considering how solid the action gameplay is here it’s hard to not want to go the action route whenever you can. Jensen’s repertoire of battle rifles, shotguns, combat rifles and more all look and feel great, and they can all be customized with alternate types of ammo and accessories to better suit the situation at hand. If you’re going up against a mechanical enemy then switching your standard ammo to EMP ammo will take them down faster, and popping a silencer onto your pistol will allow you to silently pick off enemies when you don’t want to sound the alarm. There’s also a cover system that switches the perspective into third-person to give a better layout of your surroundings, which is very responsive and allows the ensuing battle to have more strategic depth as you figure out the best way to clear the room without being cleared yourself.  The gameplay variety doesn’t stop with the weapons either, as the game’s augmentations are where it truly shines in all styles of play. Jensen has 7 categories to choose from when it comes to augmentations, and each one is filled with unique abilities to choose from. Some will allow you to improve your hacking skills or scan your environment for enemies and items, while others will allow you to go invisible to slip past enemies or take them out with force moves or bladed projectiles that shoot from your arms. The moves that you have at your disposal always make you feel like a one-man army, but without making the game feel to easy.  Jensen will be doing less jet-setting than he did in Human Revolution, but that has allowed his home base of Prague to be fully developed as a living, breathing place – albeit one nervously abiding under militarized police surveillance. The setting is an impressive mix of old-world architecture and ultra-modern design, with neon ads flashing above cobblestone streets. Color is used to excellent effect, and observant players will discover little visual treats around every corner. This excellent visual design is backed up by some top-notch level and quest design.   The areas you're infiltrating are basically puzzles to be solved depending on the weapon and augmentation loadout you've chosen. I found one area that dragged on far too long, but otherwise the levels are tightly designed and allow an impressive number of possible 'solutions' for reaching your goal. I spent one afternoon discovering different ways to rob the city bank, and I don't think I found every possible method... and that was just for a side quest. Said side quests are beefy and meaningful, by the way. You won't want to skip them.  The game's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, but that doesn't mean it has none. A character's voice rarely synced correctly with their mouth movements, which can be frustrating for a game that is as immersive as this one. In addition, occasional graphical hiccups peppered the environment. Aside from that, however, the game is surprisingly sharp. My biggest complaint is that the ending feels a bit abrupt - I would have sworn I had a few hours remaining when I saw the credits rolling.  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is a mature game, tackling mature themes in a way that leads a player to reflection without explicitly demanding it of them. It not only carries the torch of a choice-driven narrative that has become synonymous with the franchise, it seems to relight it. It's a game that treats the player like an adult, while breathing a new life into the argument that video games are a form of art.  Mankind Divided is a stunning, intense experience that at no time failed to challenge me, mentally or skillfully. I didn't feel like I was playing a game that was built for me, rather I built the world that I faced at the end, and I had to live with that.",

            "review_text": "I already had a ton of fun playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution and I'm very happy that I can now enjoy the continuation of the story. The  TL, DR  of this review is that yes, there are a few controversies surrounding aspects of this game like one-use pre-order consumables, a separate tacked-on game mode that likely siphoned development time off the main game, and microtransactions which you really don't need as the game isn't grindy at all. To the contrary, it's fairly easy to get XP as well as credits (which you also don't really need, at all). I will chalk of these up to Square-Enix being greedy. I will blame the publisher for this, because I think everything else that has been crafted here is tremendous, resulting in one of the most entertaining games I've ever played. I'd like to think this means something after playing over 4,000 hours of Steam games, not counting my console or other PC gaming platform histories.  I'm bad at listing pros and cons. I don't think I'll be able to express my admiration for this game by listing a few bullet points. You may see me as a fanboy, but the fact is that, at 30 years, I've outgrown that kind of phase in my life. I simply like to style my Steam profile according to my current main game.  On to the topic at hand, this game is simply beautiful. The hubs have grown so much since Human Revolution and are much more dense, varied, and populated. I'm running the game above 60 FPS at 1080p with everything on HIGH, boosted by 2 x MSAA and Double Buffering VSYNC to eliminate screen tearing. I've also enabled all the fancy graphics options. I recommend switching textures to VERY HIGH if your GPU can handle it. The game warns you that you should have more than 4 GB of VRAM available for this, but I don't seem to have any problems with my MSI GTX 970 Golden Edition. This setting makes a big difference, because now I can really appreciate the banners, ads, little computer screens, and other details placed throughout the world. I wish real ads were this nice to look at! I can appreciate the work that went into creating these details and populating the game's world with them.  Praha simply looks great. It's refreshing to have a game take place in something that isn't a generic American city. We're getting less of those these days, but as someone living in Germany, as someone who's been to Praha many times, I can appreciate this story setting. People speak English with weird, European accents, some people talk Czech using accurate translations (AFAIK). The mission areas are generally very large and dense as well, decorated with lights, fog, lots of people, and tons of details.   You don't get loading screens when switching between buildings anymore. When you do get loading screens, e.g. when starting the game, moving between hub areas, and starting story missions, they're all nicely disguised with story summaries, little pre-rendered cutscenes, and even story cutscenes after which you're immediately back in the action.  The refurbished augmentations as well as the new ones are quite interesting, even if they are a bit flashier than necessary for playing Deus Ex in pacifist ghost stealth mode. Taking out 3 enemies with the taser fist as well as the camera watching them doesn't get old though. The offensive battle augmentations are nice as well, but relying on them isn't really the Deus Ex way. At least not for me, and this is  my  review after all.  Hacking has been given a new coat of paint - but most importantly, they've balanced the experience points properly this time. Acquiring codes and passwords is now a viable option. There is no need to hack your way through the missions to get some XP.  There is a decent number of side quests and points of interest. Some show a lot of love for fans of the series, others encourage exploration (Of which there is a lot. There's even vertical exploration.) Also,  01011000 01011000 01011000 .  I suppose there is a reason to wait until all of the bugs are fixed, but I've only ever run into one bug, which causes the game to crash if I don't enter the TF29 shooting range with a full inventory. I have to clear it all out before entering the shooting range. Other than that, I haven't run into any problems. I'm sorry if you have.  At this point, I've played 75 hours of Mankind Divided. It took me 46 hours to finish my first playthrough, which consisted of a pacifist stealth run and all the side quests. I'm halfway through my second playthrough and I'm enjoying every minute of it.  If you can immerse yourself in great video game worlds, you can have a great time playing Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - especially if you're already a Deus Ex fan and enjoyed Human Revoltion. Not everyone can. I, however, love doing it and the fact is that I adore this video game. It's a tremendous work of art that will hopefully continue as a franchise.  Thank you, Eidos Montreal. Square Enix, dial back your greedy corporate BS a bit, please. Trust in the developers and let them create their games as they envision them.",

            "review_text": "Hands down one of the best games of this current generation of gaming (so far). Like its predecessor, it dives into real-world issues and it does it in such an addicting multi-faceted manner that it boldly stands out as one of the more unique RPG experiences.  Pros: -STORYTELLING: Similar to DE:HR, DE:MD takes a similar approach to the 'PLAY YOUR WAY' mentality, but expands on it in a BIG way. Jensen doesn't really lose abilities like most RPG sequels force you to do for some reason at the beginning of the game. INSTEAD, he gains access to NEW abilities very early on, and his new abilities aren't even 'oh yeah new game new abilities' NOPE, they're actually tied into the story and there's a whole side-quest that spans a big chunk of the game length all about the new abilities. Speaking of side-missions, you now have side-missions that flow in and out of the main narrative and some being very lengthy multi-tiered side-missions that have arguably better plots than the main story. The game almost ALWAYS gives you something to do and by simply exploring the various open-zones you always have someplace to go. This game doesn't feel overwhelming like some RPGs because its locales are very condensed yet very detailed. But at the same time it's not small to the point where there's no content. The game has a very, VERY thorough lore woven throughout it and it's very noticable how much attention was given to developing the world and atmosphere for this game.   -COMBAT: If you choose the loud and proud way, combat is MUCH more intuitive and fun this time around especially with the TITAN Aug, Slow-Mo Vision, and Nano-Blades. In DE:HR, Combat existed but in a very wonky way. Combat in this game is much more fluid and guns are fairly customizable.  -STEALTH: Stealth gets MUCH harder, but you also get more cool toys to play with. The Tesla Aug and the Remote Hacking Aug make fine new additions into balancing the Stealth aspect of the game, but stealth in this game challenges the likes of MGS when it comes to late-game stuff.   -VISUALS//PERFORMANCE: Here's where the game lacks. The game LOOKS good, however animations are fairly stiff, lip sync is WAY off, almost all other non-main character models have super generic lifeless faces. Conversation animations are borderline abyssmal (they look like they're from a PS2 game, most look like recycled assets from DE:HR) and in this day and age for a game like this to have animation as its one-off is kind of a let down. However, don't let this turn you away from the game. As much as an importance visuals and graphics have nowadays, they do NOT pull away from the experience as much as you think. I'm running the game on Ultra with every possible setting on (GTX 1080) and the game runs very smoothly. I only see hiccups when moving between locations (loading assets) and have encountered the game crashing once (failed to load a save after moving up the graphics settings).  -OVERALL: WE DEFINITELY ASKED FOR THIS. 9/10, DEF GoTY contender for me.",

You can choose to do a mission in various ways, meaning there is no one 'correct answer' and the plot is interesting even if it's different than what I expected (in a good way). However this game suffers from a rather anti-climatic ending and it feels like a sequel is more than just desired. You finish the game with the wanted result but a lot of ends are left loose in what seems like a preparation for another chapter of a much greater story, making this game look like just another step in the way.",

        {
            "review_text": "Abandon all hope, ye who is allergic to walls of text.  Ok, let's set the record straight here.  This game has obviously been receiving a lot of bad press, with varying degrees of validity. Square Enix's running this game through the corporate hoops of microtransactions, scummy single-use dlc packs, and that absurd preorder controversy are all justified complaints. However, I can't shake the feeling that many people are targeting this justified negativity unfairly toward their perception of the game itself. What I am doing here is drawing a distinction between the game that Eidos Montreal developed, and the way that game was marketed and presented by its publisher, Square Enix. I have no kind words for the latter, but I am only interested in reviewing the former, not the buisness practices outside of Eidos Montreal's control.  On to the actual review. -Gameplay: As a sequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Mankind Divided does one thing: improve every aspect exponentially. Jensen controls more responsively than ever. Gun customization is a feature that I actually made tactical use of throughout the game, to the point where my only true criticism is that I wish you could quick-toggle silencers due to how often I was adjusting my weaponry. Of course, using weaponry is only one of the player'sprimary options in this game. Stealth is far more effective this time around due to a more reliable battery system enabling more frequent and effective use of x-ray vision and stealth camo, on top of a new dash ability that functions as a slightly clunkier version of Dishonored's Blink mechanic. Hacking still feels too ancillary to be considered a proper third pillar of the gameplay, since the developers were too generous with ways to bypass hacking through auto-hack tools and airvents. Just like in Human Revolution, it's probably more worthwhile to invest at least a little into all the of the playstyles to give yourself options and to have access to more experience points.  -Level Design Oh my goodness. The developers seem to have traded breadth for depth, as the single true hub, Prague, is simply a work of art. The city feels equal parts like an actual, realistically designed city and an unbelievably elegant and very player-friendly playground of different paths and routes to get you where you need to go. All the levels in the game are laid out convincingly enough to immerse you in the setting, but gamey enough that you are always very much playing a video game with deliberate level design. I can't remember the last time I was so absorbed in a game world this side of Dishonored.  -Performance Well...it's ok. Apparently it was a real ♥♥♥♥♥how when the game first launched, but like any big-budget digital game these days after a month it's patched to where it should have been when it first released. I had several CTDs early on and poets will write of my war to maintain 60fps on a PC that can run most modern releases at high to ultra settings no problem, but recent patches and new GPU drivers have solved most of those issues. By the end of the game I never dipped below 51fps in the most intensive areas, so I think I can still recommend the game as it is right now. Just use your Graphics Profile's AA settings since ingame MSAA basically halves framerates and drinks your tears.  -Writing As mixed as any modern video game. Adamn Jensen is as likable as every with plenty of solid, no nonsense lines (props to Elias Toufexis' excellent delivery). None of the side characters have as much instant, 'just-add-water' personality and tension as Pritchard (except maybe for K, who gets pretty much all of the best lines) I can't say I was ever annoyed or bored by anyone either, however. Everyone is a little more low-key this time around. The 'aug racism' actually doesn't strike me as TOO much of a stretch, but the writers could have exercised a lot more restraint in its portrayal. It's not so much shades of grey as it is Nazi police state vs wild and unpredictable minority prone to rioting. Overall the game has servicable writing, with the occasional hilarious or excellently worded line as a pleasant surprise  -Story Ok, let's make this clear: the game isn't 'unfinished'. I'm not as venomous to on-going stories and cliffhangers as most people seem to be, so maybe I'm biased when I say that the game does tell a start-to-finish story, with absorbing and informative side content on top of that. 27 hours of gameplay is roughly 5 hours longer than Human Revolution took me, so lack of content isn't the issue. If I did have to levy any criticism towards the story, it would be that it lacks polish and proper transitions to make the story they DO tell work better as a whole. For example, in the very final mission you have a brief cutscene on the spot once you reach the final room, then the game cuts to black and gives you a 'New Game+ unlocked' message before moving on to the epilogue scene, the credits, and the mid-credits stinger. Sticking the NG+ message there was jarring and sloppy, and should have been saved for after the credits. If the game had transitioned into its epilogue scenes more gracefully, I feel a lot of negative PR about how 'abrubt and unfinished' the ending is would have been prevented. That being said, the game DOES wrap up most of the short-term threads while leaving plenty open for the inevitable sequel in what is obviously an Adam Jensen trilogy. Since it is clear they have the intent of continuing where this game leaves off, for now I am willing to be patient and give Eidos Montreal the benefit of the doubt, as they have easily proven their capability. I just hope Square Enix doesn't do everything it can to damage the next game's reputation the way they did here.  TL;DR if you liked Human Revolution's immersive hub and slick gameplay, Mankind Divided only improves upon those despite some perfomance hiccups and lack of editing polish. If those are enough of a concern, wait for a sale or a Director's Cut in a couple years.",

Not even doing well and still having fun, that to me is a telling sign of the game, would definitely reccomend this to others. ",

Clearly this is the problem most of the negative reviews highlight. It tries to lead you through two different issues, the Illuminati, and the Terrorist threat. The ending sadly only covers closure for the terrorrist threat, while leaving the Illuminati issue as unknown and misterious as it started off with. To me this doesn't mean the story is bad, it is just not quite done yet. I see this game as a part one of the ending series of Deus Ex. The game clearly hints at a future plot developments and an interesting and interactive continuation.  Please view it as the first part, and look forward to the next. The next game would surely complete the storyline at which this game left off, and i have full convidence that it will deliver.  Mechanically this game is absolutely fantastic. The world provides many options of approach, for a ghost run or a combat run it is well fleshed out. The skill tree seems more developed and customisable with interesting additions to those of Human Revolution.  The side quests feel important and urges you to think before acting.  ",

(2) Story too short/shallow: yes, it feels more episodic rather than epic. But I liked this 'episode.' (3) They removed content from the game so they could monetize it as DLC: I dunno, maybe; but there's definitely enough content that I'm satisfied with what I have.  There's a fine line between cliffhangers and failing to wrap up storylines. Did they get it 100% right? Maybe not. But overall it really boils down to this: it's a pretty enjoyable game, especially if you have realistic expectations.",

For example. Hong Kong was so repeatedly mentioned in the game that I was sure we'd get to visit it during the plot. Sadly, nope.  Plotwise, a number of new interesting threads were opened up and had me intrigued until the sudden ending hit me in the face. Disappointingly, most of the plotlines ended up getting the to-be-continued treatment.  No complaints about the performance other than the long loading time between the hub districts. Some side missions require you to run back and forth between districts and the load time gets pretty ridiculous when it adds up.  I really did enjoy the game, if only it'd lasted longer.",

Its a free program that completely strips display drivers off your machine, including any fragments left in the registry from previous updates or cards. I also deleted (all files, including leftovers from Steam uninstall) and reinstalled DXMD. After, install the latest drivers for your card and give Deus Ex another shot.   This worked after I had run all the other options, including DLC on/off, turning all settings to lowest possible, updating drivers (before using DDU), running the DXMD.exe as admin, disabling steam overlay, verifying cache, redownloading and more.   PC specs are as follows:  Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit 17 4790K (Haswell) @ 4.0Ghz (no OC yet) 16G DDR3 RAM 250G Samsung 850Pro SSD (Steam drive) Gigabyte G1 Gaming GTX980 Gigabyte Z97X-SLI Mobo  *******  The game itself is a little short on depth compared to Human Revolution (Hengsha alone feels more finished than almost all of Prague) but otherwise its a worthy successor to the Deus Ex series. I'm almost certainly going to try to 100% the achievements, I enjoy crawling around in vents and stealing things so despite any troubles on launch or my feelings about Squeenix hacking the game into various DLC chapters I'll be having a good time.",

The reason why I admire the Deus Ex franchise is because these games manage to accomplish two things that are particularly important and rare in video games - they inspire and provoke thoughts. In my opinion, this is much more than a flashy sci-fi story. DE series manages to picture the core of the conflict between authority and liberty, it provokes asking important and extremely timely questions, such as 'Is the world we're living in ready for the challenges that science may bring to us in the near future?', 'Is our moral evolution lagging behind our technological advancement and progress?'. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided does have all these features and same good old touch of conspiracy and transhumanism..   So, no matter how hard the publisher tries to ruin the game with micro-transactions and horrible customer support (Submitted a ticket about missing items from the DLC bundle 5 days ago, finished the game already - still no response) - I simply cannot rate it down...  P.S.:  - No complains about ending..    A lack of closure is not only a prerequisite for a good continuation of the story that (hopefully) awaits us soon, but, in a way, it's a central protagonist's conflict   ",

The atmosphere absorbs and transports you to the gorgeous brutal cyberpunk world of Deus Ex, I was literally stuck to the keyboard whilst playing this, I even dreamed about the game world, I even had fantasies about having sex with the game. This game has the best atmosphere of any game period, you sometimes actually feel you are part of the game world, the world is compact yet dense there are tons of places to explore and secrets to find in the game hub of Prague. Human Revolution had Detroit and Hengsha, but the size of Prague more than makes up for it.  The side missions available change along with the atmosphere of Prague, first time you visit its day, once further in the main story you return, and Prague's night life comes alive , the last time you return everything has gone to chaos. Unlike the main story which is weaker to its counter parts Human Revolution and the original, the side missions make up for it, they are fun, varied and plentiful. In one side mission you have to play detective to find a serial killer who killed an Augmented Journalist outside your apartment block, the game will punish you if you don't use your brain or rush the mission so you accuse the wrong person or get yourself in trouble.   Gameplay is mostly the same as Human Revolution, but with added stealth mechanics, when you go into cover this time, you can choose which cover you wish to transition to by aiming the mouse to it, and pressing space, Adam will then move to that space in a 3rd person view.   Yes developers put love into it, but the soulless publisher SE wish to profit as much as possible from it, they don't care about Deus Ex, the fans, all they care about how much money they can exploit from it, they are like Ferengi, enough is never enough, I heard when the developers finished the game, they had two weeks to spare, in that time the developers where going to polish the game more (which it needs) but the publisher came along and wanted a free to play store on a single player game, basically paying to cheat on a well balanced game. Seemed the main story got shortened for the season pass content or possible sequel. Also there is a tacked on mode Breach that I heard has micro transactions which I probably won't try out, just like the multiplay of the Tomb Raider reboot. Why waste money developing modes we don't want, or never bought the game for?   Pros  .Absorbing Atmosphere  .Great world detail  .Fantastic Visuals .Varied Side missions .Great game play  Cons  .Bugs .Store in a single player game .Tacked on Breach .Weaker main story .

            "review_text": "Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is the sequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution by Eidos Montreal and the supposed middle game in the new Deus Ex prequel trilogy. After escaping death from the events of the previous game, augmented agent Adam Jensen finds himself in a world where normal people developed an increasing hate towards enhanced men and women and augmented terrorists are trying to let their voice be heard by any mean possible. Jensen must use his new position in a global anti-terrorist task force, TF 29, and his ties to the mysterious Juggernaut Collective to twarts the plans of the Illuminati, pulling the strings of everything.  In comparison to Human Revolution, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided offers several tweaks to the former's successful gameplay formula without adding anything truly breathtaking to the table: weapon handling is now smoother, takedown animations are more satisfying and varied and Jensen can now access to a set of new, experimental augs to better deal with enemy opposition (althought these new augs can and will cause problems to you if you don't clear a certain side quest first or don't disable some first). The main structure of the main questline has also changed: instead of visiting different hubs, Mankind Divided features a single, larger and wider main hub, the city of Prague, which is also divided in districts that can be accessed by metro (and a loading sequence). The main quest will take you to different locations to be sure, but they are far more straightforward and less prone to exploration, and can't be visited twice.  All of the above are basically the main novelties of Mankind Divided in comparison to Human Revolution. Unfortunately, the game suffers from a poor enemy and security systems variety and a questionable short lenght, so the main difficulty won't trouble you that much as it did in Human Revolution, regardless of your playstyle.  One thing that should be noted is that the PC port of Deus Ex: Manking Divided leavves a lot to be desired and it's fairly common to encounter issues of various kind even on high end PCs. Among the issues especially worth mentioning are the incredibly long loading times and the huge frames drop during certain moments or in certain zones of the game.  Another questionable aspect of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is its approach to the narrative. As mentioned above, the main questline really feels short and cut down in short order far sooner than what you'd expect. It doesn't help matters that the supporting characters aren't as memorable as the ones from Human Revolution and the whole augmentation angle is more straightforward and less developed this time around. The quality of the side quests is, instead, on the same level as Human Revolution and gives the player actual meaningful choices that will alter the fates of different NPCs (in comparison, the main questline is mainly unaffected by your choices, nor people will comment about your violent tendencies like in the past games).  Mankind Divided also comes with a separate, single-player mode called Breach, where you must impersonate an hacker moving through a cyberspace in search of secret data while avoiding security measures and artificial guards. While Breach has a very small story of its own and a different progression system than the main game, it can't really held up in comparison and becomes annoying and repetitive rather quickly.  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided really feels like a grand game that was turned hastly into a midquel to make way for a third game in a trilogy, and suffers a great deal of issues for it. As it stands, while it's not a bad game by any means, I can suggest this game only to those who enjoyed Human Revolution in the first place and few others",

The use of a SINGLE hub area is just moronic, loading screens probably made up an hour of my play time (that’s not hyperbole), and the story just isn't as interesting as Human Revolution's. However, this is still a damn good game that manages to overcome its flaws.  The primary reason for this is the gameplay, which has been improved in just about every way. From the new cover to cover system, to the game-changing experimental augmentations, to the improved level design, Mankind Divided has perfected the gameplay formula employed by DXHR. The new cover to cover system makes both controlling Adam in both stealth and combat significantly easier. And the improvement to controls don't stop there. Combat is smoother in every way. Aiming from cover is much easier, and the new ammo type system adds some depth to shootouts. The new experimental augs can radically affect gameplay. Remote hacking allows you to deactivate certain security features, the Icarus dash allows you to reach areas of the map you otherwise couldn't, and the other augs are just as useful. And all of these improvements are capped off with A+++ level design, on every single map.   However, DXMD's unimaginative story does its very best to override the gameplay improvements. You will once again play as Adam Jensen, as he attempts to track down the terrorists behind a train bombing in Prague. That’s everything. Obviously stuff happens, there are some reveals and a little bit of mystery, but the core of the story remains very simple and straight-forward. This dramatic departure from the ambition of DXHR's superb story is striking, and a clear step in the wrong direction. The voice acting and atmosphere are still quite good, but unfortunately that just isn't enough to make up for the story.  And of course there are the micro transactions. In my opinion, this is a non-issue for DXMD. The micro transactions are only accessible through the main menu, and you will have no trouble finding all the resources you need throughout the course of the game. Others may take issue with this, but I just don't care.   And that’s the story with DXMD. Is it perfect? No. Is as good as DXHR? No. Is it a superb game and a worthy sequel? Hell yes, and if you're a fan of the Deus Ex style of free-form gameplay, you will not be disappointed. ",

Amazing level design, multiple ways to approach every situation, and less yellow than human revolution, it is truly everything I hoped for from a Deus Ex game.  I should point out that my first playthrough (non-lethal; stealth) took 30 hours, exploring as much as I could, doing all the sidequests etc.  Then, I did a quick playthrough on I Never Asked For This doing only main missions, and it took 6 hours. (which is honestly a little higher than it should have been)   And finally, my most recent playthrough (lethal, doing all side quests, exploring, except I knew what I was doing this time) took 19 hours, so this might give you a decent idea of how long the game actually is.

Can feel a little short once you know your way around though. - This can essentially be a Pay-to-win game with the microtransactions, getting through some parts with extra praxis. There is no painful grind for praxis kits. - New Game Plus has been shipped this time around, and Praxis, Season Pass content do carry over. - A problem with Human Revolution was the bosses, well in this there is only the final boss, and it is optional.  My playstyle of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided was:   Ghost   Pacifist   Give Me Deus Ex Difficulty   Other people may differ but this is my approach to HR and MD.  Also, for the Frame Rate issues, turn off:  Volumetric Lighting   MSAA   Contact Hardening Shadows   The game is absolutely gorgeous, the gameplay just feels so smooth and fluid, certainly a step up from Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The cover to cover system is more dynamic, augments providing good means and methods of finding new areas. Hacking has stepped up quite a bit, one of my favorite new improvements. Traversal and ledge climbing feels smooth, still has the Explorer style of gameplay. and the HUD looks well this time around. I like the trick in how they integrated Jensen's new Augments as well, and the system of using them (You'll see what I mean). The Story isn't mindblowing or fantastic, it's good no doubt but I found some of the Side Quests more engaging, One in which answered a question about a certain character from the last game.  The main story as you can tell, After the events of Human Revolution. Natural/Aug relations are at a troublesome low 'Aug Event' Pro-Naturals and Pro-Aug bashing heads and of course the usual conspiracy storyline in the background (and the return of a few familiar faces in Deus Ex). Some of the plot points didn't surprise me though, you could figure them out at times, although once or twice I was like 'Oh, that's why', and there is some questions left to be answered at the end of the game but obviously we have more room for sequels, A lot of time to fill between Mankind Divided and the original Deus Ex.  I love the dystopian tone it sets, the obvious discrimination and paranoia (Like a problem we face today in reality), police out in force, Augs being rallied around like cattle and Golem city was a cool place to visit. I do like the attitude taken towards Jensen in the beginning and (in my playthrough anyway) see how that develops with NPCs and characters. The conversation interaction has improved immensely, there's more body language exchanged between Jensen and characters which is cool.  As for glitches and crashes, I've only had two crashes with the game, only annoying issue was the Steam Overlay not being able to show up, and when loading into a game using space, it would take you out of cover (bound to space bar) but nothing to lose the plot over.  UPDATE  this was patched out in the last update.  As for the microtransaction complaint, I agree it is silly to put Microtransactions into a Single Player campaign, and further more stupid to bind a purchase to that save game. but hey, it's someone's way of playing and who are we to judge if they're too lazy to get Praxis Points or want to breeze through the campaign with no issues, or have a big wallet. It can become a  pay to win game very easily , I can see points where people can just say 'Oh I need an upgrade to survive in Electrified Areas/Poison Gas' or 'I can just up my Stealth for this section and run through the open', people can get very lazy and rather rely on wits, rely on a wallet. The grind for getting Praxis points is not bad at all, and with new game+ they will carry over to the new game.  Season Pass Content will also carry over to NG+   Bottom line with microtransactions is that they're in a LOT of games nowadays (Along with DRM), being used by players and fans and this is why they're sticking around. We can ♥♥♥♥ and moan all we like but it's up to us to ignore them if we're that upset or bothered by them. Don't feed the problem, the game can be enjoyed without a little boost.  Personally, I enjoyed my time with Deus Ex, the story is what it is, obvious what to expect from the ending and it does leave things open for more (obviously being a 'Pre-sequel'. If you loved Human Revolution, then you will enjoy this. I got 40 hours out of the game, I will be trying out New Game+ at some point and of course the 'I didn't ask for this' Difficulty (♥♥♥♥ing memes) so I got my moneys worth I feel. It's not gonna be for everyone but if you like Stealth games and some RPG elements with decision making, then this might be right up your street.",

            "review_text": "Deus Ex Mankind Divided is a tough game to rate. The core is a worthy follow up to Deus Ex HR. Sneaking, exploring, multiple routes, stealing everything not nailed down... DX:MD nails that. You can't say this isn't a Deus Ex game, and you can't say Eidos dropped the ball on this. The writing is sharp, the levels clever, the world beautiful, the sneaking solid, even the gunplay is satisfying...  But, at the same time, it is missing something. We have one HUGE hub to loot... and that's it, really. The plot and world are almost completely devoid of scale, and the villainous plot is so penny ante and basic that it almost recalls Watch Dogs's villainous ctOS mechanisms just beind used to rig an election. There's one villain, one boss fight, one evil scheme, and a bunch of mystery men in the shadows you don't see except for some clever ways that the game shows their plots going into effect.  If you can get around the very subdued scope of the game, DX:MD delivers about a dozen of the finest written side-quests of the franchise, even if the third act of the game runs heavy on the back and forth.  And, don't get me wrong, the problems of the franchise are still there. The game is still terribly easy, like every Deus Ex game. The game is packed to the gills with stuff to collect that you don't need. Nonlethal+stealth is still vastly overpowered and overrewarded. There is no tough enemy as they can all be instantly taken out with just one or two items, such that the game's boss fight has to take place in a giant corny fun house of lasers and turrets to try to make it feel a condensed Deus Ex level, like the boss thought you were going to be playing Spy vs Spy. I get people were mad at HR's bosses but they felt cleverer than just 'big dude who goes down in one grenade like everyone else.' Hell, the boss in the game is literally immune to everything but the items that one-shot him anyway!  But you don't play Deus Ex if you want a challenge. You play it for a game with a dozen play styles, and Deus Ex MD delivers on that. New augmentation abilities, from teleports to firing wrist blades, as well as more buffs on the combat tree to really differentiate a shooting Jensen from a sneaking Jensen. There is more stuff to play with.  The cash shop, the goofy free-to-play style Breach mode, the weak ending... a lot of this reeks of the sort of schizophrenia that has plagued Square Enix as of late. Their recent releases, the lousy Just Cause 3, and the excellent-despite-itself HITMAN are certainly symptoms of this. Square Enix has some of the best talent in the business at their beck and call, and they are doing their level best to thwart them at every turn in a way that can only be compared to the things Activision is doing to Platinum as of late.  It's easy to be disappointed by DX:MD. I don't blame anyone. Nobody would have been happy with Deus Ex 1 had that game ended after taking down the head of NSF. Nor would we have been happy to see Deus Ex HR end after the first or second bosses. But what we DO have is still a high quality game.",

I never wanted it to end. Even if the game had been 50 or 100 hours, I get the feeling like I would still want more. Is the game perfect? Not by a long shot. It has some minor interface issues, some vague quest completion requirements, the map does feel small, but I feel like it was reused to good effect. In the end, I just want more of it.  The complaints are over used and over rated. The microtransactions? While I disagree whole heartedly with the idea of it, I just won't buy them. If the game sucked around the micro transactions, I could see a point here, but the game is wonderful so it feels like a moot point. Length? 30 hours does feel a bit short for an RPG, but at the same time, there are still much shorter games for the same price. The game I finally got around to playing prior to this was Wolfenstein: The New Order, and that game took 10 hours to beat. It's $20 now sure, but on release it was $60 and was still only 10 hours long, and look how good the reviews are on that.  All in all, the game is a blast to play.

Took out most enemies in the game with non-lethal methods (except some parts of the third visit to Prague and the timed section at the very end). Got pacifist and foxiest of the hounds after a playtime of 95 hours.   I don't understand how anyone who took their time exploring can be disappointed with the game length. It is a good thing that they offer major shortcuts in most mission areas. I can see how it would be possible to ghost through the game in eight hours or so, but it makes no sense to call the game short after having played it like that.   The only weak section in the game for me was the second visit to Prague. It looked really nice with the nighttime setting, but I had already explored everything thoroughly on my first visit and there was no 'twist' like the third time. I think that the game would have benefitted from a progression of hacking abilities that was partly tied to completion of main story missions, to leave more stuff to explore for the second visit to Prague. This could have been combined with some additional areas, such as a couple more security tiers on the Palisade Property Bank or expanded hostile areas of the TF29 HQ.  The balancing of credits and praxis felt off as well, but it didn't feel like these issues had a large impact on the experience. Weapons should probably sell for less, and some additional super high end merchants would have given more purpose to the credit hunt. The weapon upgrade systems could have more tiers, more compatible weapons and larger requirements for crafting parts to give more purpose to the in-game economy as well. Regarding praxis, I would have slowed down the praxis rewards for experience gains and placed more in the environment as rewards for exploration.  Palisade Property Bank was the highpoint of the game for me. The Deus Ex game systems really shine when you have complex layers of non-hostile and hostile areas that are intermingled, guarded by advanced security systems and densely connected via various shortcuts.   The social enhancement aug is horrible. I am too much of a completionist to go without it, but it reduces the unique conversation battles to a trivial exercise of watching a couple of blinking lights. Should totally be removed without any kind of replacement for the next game.  The game has an issue with invisible borders. I hated that the first mission in the game is one of the worst offenders here, but it continues to be a problem through the whole experience, especially if you try and build box towers and use the Icarus dash. If Dishonored can make environments fully explorable, why can't Mankind Divided?  I guess I am sounding pretty negative the last couple of paragraphs, but the overall experience was fantastic. I can't speak for people who played the game as a first person shooter, but as a control freak predator style stealth RPG the experience Mankind Divided has to offer is second to none. The sidequests felt really well-done from a story perspective compared with the last game. They offer a real open world setting with Prague, compared with the corridor cities of the last game. Despite the open world, the main story is paced wonderfully imo.   It makes me sad that the game doesn't seem to be doing all that well commercially ... It is probably my GOTY thus far in 2016, and I warmly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of stealth games, RPGs, the original Deus Ex or reboot Deus Ex.",

            "review_text": "Mankind Divided is the kind of game where if you liked the last game, you'll probably like this one too. For the most part, it takes Human Revolution's framework and builds on it. The graphics are much better, the characters don't animate like marionette puppets in cutscenes anymore, you get XP for using passwords now, and the game adds a lot more use to the augs that were pretty much a waste of praxis in the last game, like the toxic gas breathing aug or pretty much any of the eye augs. There are a handful of new augs added in, but most of them do the same thing and involve shooting things from your arm, ranging from lethal to nonlethal, though there are some interesting ones like a remote hacking aug too. The game only has one hub, Prague, but they seem to have taken notes from 2014's Thief (which, no matter what you might think of the game as a whole, had an amazing city hub), and there's dozens of hours of content in the city, with plenty of things to do and see and steal, and its design really encourages you to get the most out of the navigation-based augs. It is a bit disappointing that it's the only hub, but each time you come back to it it feels a lot different than the revisits to Detroit and Heng Sha from HR.  The only part that doesn't really hold its weight is the main storyline, unfortunately. There are little bits and pieces of a conspiracy, and the game brings Janus and Vega (though even the two other people who played The Fall would be forgiven for not recognizing her, since they changed her design to the point that she's black now for some reason) into the main series, but the overall storyline feels fairly insignificant, and by the time it ended I thought it was just starting. I already felt like Human Revolution was a bit light on the overall conspiracy aspect that the series is known for, but in Mankind Divided it's not really there at all except in the intro and outro. That isn't to say that the story is bad by any means, and the main missions are still great and plenty of fun, but fairly often I felt more drawn to the side content than the actual main story because it tended to be more interesting. I also felt like the whole racism thing was seriously overplayed; it's interesting to see, but at the same time it's also really unbelievable at times, and feels a bit cartoonish in some cases.  But with all that being said, you can't review this game without also addressing the elephant in the room. Mankind Divided features microtransactions, allowing you to purchase praxis kits with real money. The Season Pass also includes 'free' praxis, and so does the paid side-game Deus Ex Go. Personally, I didn't have any trouble having too much praxis to know what to use it on by the end of the game, and though it is a bit telling that the only person who sells praxis kits in-game has doubled the price since HR, I don't personally think it's a problem, but your opinions may vary. The microtransactions are very subtle, and aside from the Shop option in the main menu you won't even know they're there if you don't want to see them. It's also worth noting that the preorder DLC items seem to be a one-use thing, and if you bring them into your game you can only use them in one save file. Thankfully, the game features New Game+.  Overall, Mankind Divided is a fantastic game, and probably my favorite game from Square's Eidos. If you're the kind of person who likes to explore and do things on your own (and if you're a Deus Ex fan, you probably are), you can easily get around 40 hours out of the game; I spent 15 just doing side quests and exploring the city before I even started the first real main mission. I have heard of others finishing in around 20, but I can't imagine that unless you rush through the game. There's plenty of detail packed into every level of MD, and it really encourages you to take your time and look at everything. The main storyline is probably the weakest of the series so far, but it wasn't bad, and definitely not bad enough for me to not recommend the game. Overall, MD isn't the perfect modern Deus Ex we've been waiting for, but you can see it from here.",

It feels horrible having so many people push potential players away when there is so much to enjoy. If your worried about bugs, come back in a few weeks.

            "review_text": "A great game that's over-stuffed with 'real world interactivity' and (optional) DLC microtransactions for both Single-player and Breach Mode is how I could describe it. I recommend if you can easily ignore the hidden Triangle codes hidden around the game and a very slightly (and better in ways?) worse UI.  I've spent around 3 hours in the 'Give Me Deus Ex' mode and here are my thoughts:   Gameplay : It's Human Revolution 2.0, which is exactly what I was hoping for. Human Revolution did an excellent job at taking what made Deus Ex fun and brought it up to a modern shooter style. So instead of completely ♥♥♥♥ing with it like Invisible War, they took what worked, improved the gunplay, changed some grievences with the old system like completely overstuffed inventories, and overall made it better. The new augments are awesome too, although are pretty much completely optional.  I knew that they were going to reset Adam's augmentations at some point (because how else would the game work if you were already completely decked out?), but i'm glad they found a plot point that made it work without looking stupid. I thought it was going to be something really stupid, or even a close repeat of HR, but for the most part it leaves questions in a good way.   Story : I can't say much about the story, but from what i've seen, it's really not as bad as RPS and the like make it out to be. Human Revolution was all about Jensen and what he has caused and done for the world and his motivations. If HR is about the character, then MD is about the world behind him. Jensen plays a bystander to the action by large in this game, only engaging deep in the thick of it when he feels he needs to, and that's fine.  I don't want another 'love interest, so therefore go through enemy compounds to get girlfriend, find out she's using you, wonder why you did it' story, because that's all HR was besides the Panchea incident. Overall, Deus Ex was never really about the story, so if you're looking for a deep engagement, just know that this game is more about Illumunati influence than Adam Jensen questioning his humanity, which he has already done in HR.  I will rewrite this some more or leave it by the time I finish the entire game.   Graphics/Performance : The graphics in this game are really fantastic compared to HR. It's still got the kind of 'everything shiny and bright' kind of style to it, but textures are greatly improved, the character models are very superb looking (except Sarif I would say), the contact shadow hardening on faces makes them look astounding, and the reflections and lighting are very nice. This is all on High settings w/o MSAA/TAA and 1080p.  My system is: MSI R9 380 4GB 980hz AMD FX-6300 OC@4.2Ghz 8GB RAM Windows 10 64-bit  I haven't ran an FPS counter, but compared to the little bit I played of the Xbox version, I'd say I run about 40-60 FPS with drops to ~35. It's completely playable for me and it USUALLY stays in the 50-60 range, but otherwise I don't ever really mind 30fps as long as it's stable. People seem to be really upset with anything less than 60 though, so if you're &gt;that&lt; worried about framerate, you should probably keep away until DirectX 12 or some optimization patches.",

The core gameplay is still very good, ableit there are few true improvements or new mechanics over HR besides a few new abilities for the main character to uprgrade. I didn't have a huge problem with this because there is no need to mess with a good thing. Graphically the game is massive improvment over HR; the main hub city of Prague looks beautiful and gone are the comparitively cardboard faces of HR for more realitic looking citizens. Unfortunately, the story is where this game stumbles. It actually starts very well, and just as I thought I was getting into the meat of it the game just...ends. Everything that the game builds up seems to come to nothing and i don't know if i've played a more unsatisfying ending in recent memory.   This is a good game, but it doesn't live up to it's predecessor.",

More of the same with a lot of new things thrown in to keep it interesting.  The ending was a bit strange but to me it looked intentional. Think of how the middle movie in a set of 3 would end.  There were loads of new weapons in this game and I didnt get to try half of them on my first run through. There are several replay options as well. I suspect the game could turn out very differently depending on what choices you make.  So all in all for me: * No performance issues * Good storyline/game play * In game purchases are shady but ignore the stores and just play the game and they'll stop trying.  Worth the money imo.",

            "review_text": "Its weird to see what kind of arbitrary standards people have for games and performance in general.  I suppose for $60 you aught to expect a lot in terms of quality, which is definitely true; though the recommended system specs are pretty accurate. My rig is better than the recommended and my performance is flawless, no crashes, no bugs, no random framerate dips, just a smooth 60 all the way through the game.   Chances are the minimum required recommendations are for people who are OK with 30 FPS, because I imagine that's how they determine that; with that in mind, the game doesn't lie about performance. You should know what to expect if you pay attention, and anyone who didn't shouldn't complain that they got burned.  The FOV was a little too low for me but you can just hex edit that; which is better than a lot of games in recent memory I was really excited for. Again, not a concern.  I'm actually one of the few people who likes having mouse acceleration on for his FPS experiences; so that didn't bug me too much. Though there's a steam guide for fixing it too, so I imagine that's not somethign to be concerned about either.  The game ironically pushes the anti-corperatism message while putting in some hilariosuly pathetic microtransaction system into the game; making it pretty clear that the marketing of the game was done at a corperate level, rather than the development studio. The microtransactions are basically paying for power; the hilarious thing here being that this is a singleplayer game, you can just pull up cheat engine and give yourself more power that way; no need to even look at the 'shop'. It shouldn't be a concern.  =======================================  Aright, I addressed the negitivity, now lets talk about the actual game parts lol.  Gameplay is an upgraded version of human revolution. Its quite fun and quite challenging, even if you do max out on power early on. I played the game batman style and spooked the ♥♥♥♥ out of ppl more than anything else.  Plot wise, I would describe it as about as good the mass effect series; Nothing amazing or mindblowing in terms of storytelling but it hits all the right notes for me to be totally engaged. Characters (at least the main ones) are developed well enough (except jenson oddly, he probably could have gone the gordon freeman route and just not said anything and he'd be at the same point). This of course excludes Janus; who is basically just some dude.  The plot progresses in a really weird way though. The first 2/3rds of the game feel like a lot of solid storytelling and character building; while also creating some dramatic buildup as you complete missions and interact with the world around you. You start to learn more and more things about waht's going on adn what kind of conspiracies are happening. Then at the last third of the game that structure takes a total nose dive, and you suddenly wind up getting a bunch of random unanswerable questions, as though the game were suddenly setting up a sequal rather than building on anything; and then the game just kinda ends abruptly.   Sidequests don't really impact the game too much, you get a news article about them and that's it; but the choices you make in the main plot do affect stuff; nothing crazy dynamic, but they tweak the way some missions go later on.  The game also puts in this really neat thing called 'breach mode' which is basically a fun progressional sandbox of sorts where you're given randomized loot as you go through a huge series of data servers trying to gather intel; being stealthy or guns blazing. Something that I never asked for; but appreciated none the less, definitely injects more game into the game; even if there's still some weird micropay things going on x3.  If that last half of the game didn't go the way of so many other triple A releases; this would probably be my favorite singleplayer game of the year. As it is though, the gameplay is definitely tight, and the story is tight enough to keep you moderately engaged in the world; at least until the end.",

Story feels unfinished in a way, but I'm sure $quare Enix has a plan for that... a $29.99 plan for that... welp, DLC in HR was okay, I'll buy it anyways since I'm a consumer ♥♥♥♥♥  Gameplay: You can finally shoot hordes of enemies without getting F%CKED over by the dated aiming of HR, the stealth feels just like it did in HR, but it feels slightly dumbed down for a wider audience (watch the TV SPOT, they chose the most generica song for it (Jungle - X Ambassadors) I had a blast with this game for sure though.  GRAMPHICS: It looks purty at max settings in ultrawide, you can tell it's sort of dated because this started development in like 2011/2012, but it's still pretty as hell.  Sound: PEW PEW PEW, EXPLOSION, ENEMY CHATTER, COMBAT MUSIC, all of this comes together and sounds 10x better than Human Revolution's sounds.  Microtransactions: If you're mad about this you're kinda dumb, considering the fact this is a PC game and you can just use a trainer regardless.  Performance: If you didn't turn off MSAA, Contact Hardening shadows, Or volumetric lighting, you're probably struggling on an older machine, on my main rig (Core i7 4770k, 32gb Ram, GTX 980 ti 6gb, SSD) it runs at a constant 60fps with MSAA on, Contact Hardening Shadows set to on, Volumetric Lighting set to on, basically maxed out at 2560x1080. On my laptop, (Core I7 4710HQ, GTX 970m 3gb, 12gb RAM, HDD) it runs great on very high settings at 30fps, Low-High settings at 60fps, it runs great considering it's a laptop. On my first rig ever (2011-2013) it runs at a solid 30fps on high settings (Intel Core I5 2500k, 16gb RAM, GTX 650 TI 2gb OC, Hybrid SSD/HDD) This game is perfect for performance, just don't ever overwork your computer, every new release is like this on older/less powerful machines, you gotta tinker with your ♥♥♥♥ until you're comfortable, if you're on a lower end/older machine you're not gonna be playing this on Ultra/Very High, you're gonna be hovering around Medium/high settings at 30-60fps. The game crashed a hell of a lot more on my Windows 7 rig (64 bit), than both the Windows 10 rigs (64 bit)  It's a fun game, you should buy it when they release the Director's Cut a year from now, if you're a die hard Deus Ex fan like me, you should give this a look when it's on sale (or buy it on CDKEYS like me and get 20 bucks off)",

            "review_text": "Deus Ex. Most people are too young to have played the original. Therefore I would like you to youtube Ross's Game Dungeon: Deus Ex. For without it, you will not understand what I personally am reviewing.  Do it before you continue reading my review. You will not be dissapointed.  Now then. This is a story driven corridor shooter in the same vein as, well, most games. From Doom to Mass Effect, this type of game is the quintessential game, ever since real-time 3D games were invented. The Deus Ex series are all of this genre, yet more than the genre. They add a production value and developer toil that few games see. They are the choose your own adventure of Mass Effect, they are the Futuristic version of the Thief series (more so than say Splinter cell), they are what Watch Dogs wish they could be.  A word of warning. This is not an open world game. This game has sky-boxes, it has invisible walls, and it has a rudimentary á posteriori approach to how the player interacts with the game-world. You will restart when you fall off the ledge and into electricity. You will restart when you fail a hack and start the alarm. You will restart so often that save-scumming becomes a pointless term. And yes, you will restart even when you do not die; because you want to try and control the outcome of choices the game gives you.  The dialogue and voice-acting is so good that while the prototypical gamer will apply á posteriori, you can and should apply a á priori method in choice making.  Now that I consider it, I would suggest that you gimp yourself on purpose. Do not use augs that make tasks easier, rather, use augs that give you more freedom. If you do, then you will find that the game is a good FPS-, a good stealth-, and a good choose your own adventure game.  However, the game has faults. And when you sit with a game that has obviously cost a lot of time, passion, and money to make, you will feel baffled about why such easy tasks have not been done properly.  It might seem like small potatoes to the developers and people who do not play a lot of games. But there is mandatory mouse acceleration, which stops reflex aiming so ingraned from FPS play. It has variable mouse sensitivity that makes sniping impossible unless you go around and quick-scope like a 10 year old CoD player. And the game has memory leaks that forces you to only play a few hours at a time. These artifacts of a 3P (♥♥♥♥ poor ports) production are down right stupid. No gamer with more than 50 hours total, would want mouse-acceleration, nor variable sensitivity. Aiming with a mouse is based on the very fact that moving the mouse gives a specific rotation of the cross-hair. Youtube CSGO aiming, and you will see how religious people are about these things.  But most of all. The premise of the game is flawed SJW style. The game presents an apartheid style society where people with mechanical limbs and implants are seggregated from the 'naturals'. There are crude jokes about their lower social status, cops will harras you and extort you. And everywhere there are conversations that dehumanizes augmented people. Yet, they go around calling it racism.  In the previous game, the augmented went crazy and killed people. They are stronger, faster, and more deadly than the naturals. Non-augmented people are actually in their right to curb augmentation, and they are in the right to distance themselves from augmented people in case it happens again. In addition, getting a robotic arm in no way constitutes you as part of a new race. This is the same type of bone-headed missapropriation of words and concepts that a tumbler feminist would love. And that hurts.  If you watched Ross's episode on the original Deus Ex, you know that the game drew its conspiracies from reality. It showed patterns that most people would never know about. It transended gaming, to become a sooth-sayer about our very real future. Hell, it predicted the rise of global terrorism. There is nothing real about the apartheid that Mankind Divided presents. However, while narratively it cannot reach the level of the original Deus Ex. It is still a good game, a great game even.  I do reccomend that you buy this game. It is the opposite of No Man's Sky. It is not philosophy. But it will entertain you. Because it checks more boxes than any other modern game.  I just wish I could shove that stupid beard and pointless techno-sun-glasses inside a helmet so I did not have to be reminded how insanely douch my character looks in conversations.",

It's not so much of a cut to black, just the execution seemed poor.  Its not a short game by any means. I clocked in at 30ish hours, that was on a pacifist run and doing all the sidemission (that I found). I would compare this game to mass effect two if HR was the only other game of the series. Much like ME2 (when it first came out), this game has the best gameplay mechanics, much improved graphics, smaller scale story and an ending that felt a little rushed and making you want more.  It is definitely a game that is worth buying. However the DLC and possibly the season pass is something to think twice about. So far the DLC released is a bit short for my liking, though they have introduced some new mechanics which are awesome.",

The mouse acceleration problem is defo a problem for anyone not stealthing but i'm sure it will be sorted and as much as it's a scummy thing to do, there will be trainers to unlock the one use dlc + extras in game at some point.  Other then that the game is fantastic. Nice stealth, the new augments are great, hacking change is abit 50/50 due to randomness of detection now. It's honestly a shame how easy steam haters can tank games these days. Deus ex generally deserves higher praise and at this rate i doubt we will see another installment. I wish developers would stop with the dlc sponging. It doesnt work, it hurts sales overall and its really disrespectful to customers.  Anyway its a must try for any fan of the genre",

There is a 'multiplayer' mode for the game, but that's just completing levels and setting times for other players around the world to beat. All in all, a good package. But the problem many people have with the game, was the singleplayer microtransactions.   Hear me out. It's a bad business model and if we don't show our frustration towards this model, then sadly in the near future, it'll become the norm. But the thing is, never did i ever have the feeling i needed to buy something to help me through the game. In fact, this option isn't forced on the player at all.

            "review_text": "Well, to be honest, it was an enjoable ride, but a lot of things inside this game made it very difficult to me, to give it a positive review, but I should start from the beginning.  First and maybe most important to everyone who didn't play Human Revolution; you get a 'short' (circa 17 minutes) summary of all the events during the story of Human Revolution, so you can play Makind Divided without playing the predecessor. Interesting sidenote for all the other players, who played Human Revolution: During this video, there are no hints, which of the free choices you have during the storyline, is used to tell the story of Makind Divided. An Example: You get no information of what happened to Jensens former pilot Faridah Malik. Another Example: You won't find out, which of the endings caused the storyline of Mankind Divided. You only get hints during the story, and you have to think for yourself, to find out.  This was at first a strange occurance, but still, I was eager to play. After the summary, you get a short cutscene in a VTOL-Aircraft and you land in Dubai, to invstigate a case there. In that Cutscene you don't get a clue, why Jensen is sitting in a VTOL with soldiers. You only get a cliché briefing from your 'chief' and you get the classic options of lethal/non lethal, short/long range combat, which players of Human Revloution already knew. this mission is used as a tutorial and I really needed it, because they changed the controls, which is, in fact, another negative point. I really had problems to aim at enemies, and during the whole game, I rarely tried to use the Rambo way, because of that controls. The mouse sensitivity, when aiming was just awful and you have to keep pressing the right mouse button to hold the sights. I never found the switch in the controls, that it stays when just clicking the right mouse button once. This and some other controls were just badly choosen, so I decided to set everything back to Human Revloution, so I, at least get a little bit used to everything.  So, I finished the Dubai Mission and you promptly get to Prague. Prague looked beautiful and even though I just played with 'High' settings, the graphics there were shwon at it's best. Sure, it still had flaws, especially with face animations, but I come back to that later. All in all, from a graphics point of view, I had no problems and I am using a Geforce GTX 970. I just lowered the graphics and some other parameters like shadows and anti aliasing, which just devours a lot of power.  So, I walked across Prague and get used to the new kind of open-world they offered. You get some side missions which were pretty good, I think. One mission contained a murder case, another one of finding things, another one of stealing or breaking into something, a lot of investigation and dialogue based mechanics, but still, satisfying when completing one of them, but nothing special. And here I find another netagive point: You just get too distracted with all the side missions, that you almost completly forget the main story. I had this with Metal Gear Solid V and Assassin's Creed IV, where you just have a huge open-world, which gives you a lot of freedom, but also the danger of forgetting the main plot. This game is another good example. I just found myself, walking from A to B, to complete the side mission and this almost took 2 Hours. Later when I completed 3 or 4 of them I scracthed my head and thought 'okay, where do I have to go on next and what happened before that?' So, open the inventory, looking at the main mission bar, and then heading back to the main plot.  Oh yes, and I almost forgot to mention: During your free exploration you have two areas in prague, both of them are seperated in two different levels, connected with a subway-system. The loading time is just awful long when travelling between these two points. I, just measured the time once, and came almost to 3 Minutes! For a 2016 open-world game, this is an awful long time period, and the sad thing is, the areas aren't even that big! Sure, there is a lot to explore and find, but still, this is no excuse for such loading times!  I also had to get used to the new kind of art style in the inventory. It is darker and a little bit more convoluted. Sometimes, I haven't found things as fast as in Human Revolution, but with some time I got used to it.  The main story is pretty short and the ending was cunfusing and dissapointing at the same time. You litterally have just ONE boss fight, sorry for the small spoiler, but I realy have to mention this. After that Bossfight the epilogue cutscene starts, answers some questions and then the credits is coming next, with a short cutsene in between, so you should stay on it (well, and because you can't skip it, and have to stare at all the names circa 15 minutes long). The cheeky thing is, not all of the questions raised during Mankind Divided will be answered and you get left alone, with the questions in your mind, so, you are forced to buy following DLC's, Expansion packs or successors. They really should have took the time, to give the fans at least a good and satisfying ending, and not just a part of it. During that cutscene they also mention some of your completed side missions, but if they get mentioned or not, is not very important, nor does it satisfy you, when Eliza Cassan reports them. She just summarize them, and then goes on with the next topic, that's all you get. When you expect, that your decisions have some sort of greater impact, well, you get dissapointed.  Also the location variety is ridiculously low. [Small Spoiler] The Loctations are:  - Dubai - Prague - Golem City - Prague - Switzerland - Prague - London  Golem City and Prague were the only locations worthy to be mentioned, but all other consisted of small areas, which were disapointingly empty and somehow heartless made. Even though Human Revlolution had smaller areas, but they had more flaire and athmosphere in it, than these. I thought I got to see some other places during these dystopian times, but also here, I gut dissapointed.  During that main story you get to a few 'crossings' where you have to choose, which path you take. There aren't many of great impact for the storyline. You just get some other sort of dialogue, when you choose otherwise.  ALso, as mentioned before, the facial animations aren't very convincing. Only if you get to an imporatant storyline dialogue [small spoiler] like Talos Rucker later, for example), the facial expressions are far more convincing, but during side missions you get over gesticualting NPC's whose facial expressions are ridiculously B-Movie styled and just look awful. Only the voice acting made it bearable.  I should mention the sound/music. These are, with the graphics and the athmosphere one of the best things in Human Revolution. The Voice cast does their Job perfectly. Specifically the voice acting from Adam Jensen, Talos Rucker, Victor Marchenko, and Alex. Musically you get orchestral masterpieces mixed with electronic elements from Michal McCann, who also did an awesome job with the Human Revolution Soundtrack.   So, I really should focus on a result. A lot of people are asking now, why does he still recomend this game after he criticises it more, than praising it? Simple: Steam just has a recommend and not recomend button, and this game is still too good to be not recommended.  Sure, it has major flaws, like the controls, the very short and not satisfying ending (where the Human Revolution endings were better made, with a clearer message), the loading times, the smaller variety of loctaions and more, but still, you get an enjoyable ride with tons of side missions and things which just keeps you playing for hours. Also the athmosphere is great, mixed with the awesom soundtrack and voice acting you get a unique gaming experience.  So, I still can recommend the game. ",

            "review_text": "My first playthrough took over 90 hours and I loved every minute of it. Exploring Prague, discovering all of its little secrets and stories, studying the level in order to find the most optimal of routes leading to the completion of an objective - all of that was an absolute delight. I enjoyed it just as much as I remember enjoying Human Revolution the first time I played it.  Gameplay, I thought, was much improved over its predecessor. The movement is more fluid and both stealth and guns feel a lot more authentic. On a more negative note, the AI could really use some work. First, the detection problems: Sometimes an unsuspecting NPC won't react to your actions, even if said actions involve hacking into a computer or punching their comrades in the face right next to them. Other times they will be alerted to the tiniest of sounds coming from the room above or below them. Combat AI is even worse. Enemies constantly run into your line of fire and rarely try to flank you, meaning playing through the game aggressively is a breeze even on the highest difficulty and without activating any of the combat oriented augs - you just need a decent gun (such as the Combat Rifle), enough ammo, and a good cover spot. That's why, if you want at least a bit of a challenge, I'd stick to stealth, and refrain from activating certain augs (such as the Cloaking System, Smart Vision and Tesla). Even with the aforementioned detection problems, it's still the way the game was apparently meant to be played. On the subject of stealth, in future DE games, I'd like to see instances of NPC's moving through the level in a more random manner rather than just following dev placed waypoints on the map.   Level design was also taken to the next level. The levels feel less gamey, but no less fun to explore. The game is still filled with vents, but this time they're almost completely optional even for stealth players. Still, I'd like to see less of them in the next game, since you can pretty much (if you want to) avoid every enemy in the game just by using vents (and they're not hard to find or gain access to either). Also, at first I thought having only one hub world was a step back from HR, but after having experienced both games, I can safely say less hubs and more detail is much better than more hubs and less detail.   Plot wise, the main quest was enjoyable enough if a bit uneventful. I enjoyed the conspiracy bits and the way it rewarded exploration in that players who just blindly follow the main objectives don't really get the whole story, since information relevant to the story and the character of Jensen is often hidden in pocket secretaries, computers and sometimes revealed just by listening to NPC chatter. Still, I wished it lasted a bit longer and that more would be revealed. It seems like just as the plot starts to get really interesting, the game ends. I wanted moar. :rage:   The side quest, however, are excellent and reminded me of some of the RPG's of old in terms of quality. There aren't that many of them, but they're all memorable in different ways: either by complementing the main story, fleshing out the main character or telling a story of common individuals just trying their best to survive in this unforgiving, yet strangely appealing world. Quality over quantity is what is all about here.    If not through quests, you can also learn more of the world and its individuals by simply exploring abandoned or not so abandoned places, talking to random NPC's, and so on. There are also these unlogged micro quests (such as making sense of a certain murder, uncovering a smuggling operation, finding answers related to main or side quest before even receiving the said quest, and so on), which will only be apparent to those who explore and pay attention.  The publisher's shady practices notwithstanding, I can safely say that any self-respecting RPG lover is missing out by not playing this game. In the age where almost everything (from food to entertainment) is designed to offer instant gratification, this game feels like a welcome surprise (especially considering it's not an indie game). Games such as these are a true rarity and should be revered instead of shunned if there is to be any hope of similarly engrossing games ever appearing in the future.",

            "review_text": "Deus Ex Mankind Stuttering Divided | Performance Review | 19 Hours Played  SYSTEM: i7 5960x / Win 10 / 2 Titan X Maxwell / 64g DDR4 / Game installed on SSD  When I review with so many unoptimised games out there I prefer to concentrate on how the game plays than the overall game / story as I believe these days as games get more expensive and you find the dam thing is a terrible port then you feel cheated, so without any further to do...  The Good Before I become picky know that I gave this game a positive thumbs up as I enjoy the well designed levels, the storyline seems more personal this time around, the augmentations are awesome and the sound design is great except for the sound of guns that could do with better sampling as they sound like pea shooters, but anyway good stuff...  The Bad The game is not optimised, again developers take the console route and give PC gamers the after thought, you cant blame them, how can we compete with giants like Sony greasing developers palms, but lets not get into conspiracy theories, lets talk about how the game plays.  Stutter Fest: It does not matter if you turn all the bells and whistles off, choose the lowest graphic settings Prague will stutter and to be honest it is game breaking, it takes you out of the wonderful world the developers have created and can make you feel nauseous, no joke. At first I believe this to be attributed to assets loading in, HOWEVER.... the stuttering almost but not entirely dissipates if your not in SLI. Some people will tell you, turn this and that off, they do not seem to be able to read my posts that I have played it on the lowest settings as an experiment and it stutters as if it is trying to compete with Watch Dogs. Stuttering was not present in Dubai nor the other levels, it seems to be mainly in the hub areas.  Invisible Objects: You will randomly bump into object that do not exist, this mainly happens when acceding or descending stairs bumping you to the left or right of the screen, it does happen while walking around also, its rare but annoying.  Sound and Music: Awesome music, the game sound is great except for guns, the pistol for example sounds like a pea shooter.  Loading Times: They can be long but the same levels sometimes load 50% faster, seems random, I suggest using an SSD like myself...  Driver Or Game Issue: This is the question, like I mentioned the game runs much smother on a single card, in SLI I am getting with everything maxed (MSAA / VSYNC OFF) at 1080p 144hz 90 – 115 fps, however in single this drops to 49 – 63 FPS. Another thing worth noting when the stutter begins in Prague the FPS does not drop and this is why I first thought it was related to assets loading in, but in single card its mainly fine at the cost of FPS.  Buy It / Rent It? I would buy it however if you have not got a high end card maybe wait for them to sort out the problems, when will that be is the question, consoles always take priority and we PC gamers could be looking at several weeks maybe months before this stuttering is addressed unless its on a driver level.  There you have it... Happy Gaming... Phat Monkey  ",

Not perfect, and if you played through Human Revolution you might find the first 50%-ish of this game to be a little too easy like I did.  The prejudice allegory doesn't work super well sadly, it's too bad they didn't stick to a harder sci-fi or conspiracy theme. The issue is that in real life, predjudice is ridiculous since we're all human. In Deus Ex however, sheparding people who can have weapons built into their limbs actually makes a hell of a lot of sense. SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD  Criticism was directed at the ending for being abrupt which is fair. It isn't a deal breaker, and the last mission is good enough, ending in the only boss fight, who also cannot be killed if you want the Pacifist achievment. Watch through the credits as well.",

For instance, major plot point in the completely optional Tarvos corporate vault + Even weak enemies are deadly good. AIs work together (but could stand to be a bit more aggressive) + Seamless transition into zero-consequences tutorial mode and back + Unique weapons are back + Stun gun is now a mid-ranged nonlethal with EMP + Pistol and cloak still OP + Silenced shotguns (wtf) + Titan + EMP / flash shielding = god mode + Cover mode is actually useful for takedowns and remote hacking + Main NPCs are memorable + New game+ (Items, augs all carried over) + Great performance for a port (GTX780M), although some folks had major problems  - The main thing holding this game back is the writing. Like many others have said, it's too heavy-handed and shoves line after line into your face like you can't interpret things at all. The only good thing is that it really keeps you guessing about who you can trust throughout the game. The game also ends immediately after the pace starts to pick up, like where you would normally expect an 'insert disc 2'. It will likely give those who have been closely following the narrative a big wtf.  - various cross-platform CTD preventing progress at launch - UI bugs, occasional control / context loss - Asset loading problems. Taking out or switching to a weapon shouldn't take 5 seconds sometimes - Vendors forget you after you come back to town - Loading the game with spacebar in cover mode will launch you out into the open. Whatever happened to playtesting? - Scraps are way too scarce to fully upgrade more than 1 or 2 weapons - The only boss fight is a pushover - The game feels like it is part one of something bigger, and it could have stayed for 3 more months in the oven because a lot of the bugs and the writing is immersion-breaking.  Despite its problems, I thoroughly enjoyed it while it lasted, but the ending was very disappointing.",

            "review_text": "Deus Ex Mankind Divided follows the story of Deus Ex Human Revolution and has the same protagonist, Adam Jensen. I personally like this because I like the character and enjoyed more time playing as him. The graphics look decent, the UI has been tweaked and there is no more gold or yellow filter as it was in previous game, Human Revolution. The hacking minigame is somewhat improved over Human Revolution and there are more options to takle a hack.  The setting takes a departure from Human Revolution as in, there is only a single hub area i.e. Prague, but as the developers said, it is fairly big, though nothing exceptionally bigger than the two hub areas in Human Revolution. There are secrets and hidden pathways for you to explore and they help if you are the stealthy type. The story is intersting, as many familiar faces from original Deus Ex are seen in their younger versions (from the Illuminati) and Adam is looking for answers as to who the controlling powers behind this whole augmentation thing are. The campaign is overall medium in length, lasting about 10-12 hours if you do not side quests, but you should do them as they are fairly intersting and overall, increase playtime to a healthy 35 hours or so. The game does however seem somewhat abruptly ended when you face your first boss and it ends. I suppose there are DLC to further extend the story, though I do not like the idea of a company partitioning content into DLC, if this is truly the case with this game. Gameplay wise, there are many returning augmentations and a few new augmentations which will suit either stealthy or assault approach. The guns feel good to shoot (only tried in the shooting range though, as I did stealth) and you can likely make short work of enemies should you decide to go all out assault. Stealth mechanics are also pretty much the same as other games, where enemies have set search patterns and you have to identify and avoid them. Overall, I do not like that the game ends abruptly and leaves you at a sort of cliffhanger, but I would still recommend buying it now, when it is available at less than full price (at least on third parties, if not on steam).",

            "review_text": "I'll have to say as a huge fan of Human Revolution I was waiting for this game for a long time. Many aspects of the game are improved upon while there are some minor step backs. Weapons can be further customized such as ammo type , you can craft some items though what you can craft is few in number. There's new augs you can use which can help you with your preferred style of gameplay and levels have been finely tuned to allow what ever way you wanna play be as fun as either or.   One thing that I will say about the game thats a big disappointment is the length of the game, almost feels like it was cut right in the middle of the story abrubtly so we can get a sequel. The side missions are awesome but the main story as I just said is lacking. I don't really care about the TF21 dudes, the bad guys kind of just pop in and there's not much fo me to be really motivated to taking the main villian down.  This time around the devs focused on creating one huge main city hub that changes as you further progress through the game. It has its advantages as well as disadvantages. You get to become familiar with one area and see how life of augs gets worse over time as certain events happen. You get the side missions that tie in abit with what you're doing in the main story and there's people here you meet that you'll wanna help or shoot in the head. Bad thing about it is that you don't get to see how the rest of the world is dealing with the aftermath of the aug incident only really gathering info and imagining how it might be going on in other places. You'll def miss having this relationship with your pilot pal that takes you to different places and enjoying different landscapes. One of my gripes is that there's no day night cycle for the city hub and that as huge as the city is I'm really annoyed by the fact that I need to use a subway to get to another part of the city but it feels like the size of the place doesn't warrant that but that's just me. Part of me feels thee was way more emphasis on lots of side missions and less so on the main mission.  TF21 is such a strange thing for me same with other orgs in the game. As much as I've played and replayed the game i just can't get that same amount of enjoyment as I did with sarif and prick-chard and faridah. It would of been awesome if I could go on missions with the rest of the tf21 dudes as side missions and take down some terrorists and built a relationship with the team but sadly doesn't happen.   All in all the game is still a really great game, I thoroughly enjoyed it despite some technical issues and bugs that messed with my ability to enjoy the game at 100%. (I believe most of not all those issues are resolved) I give this game a solid 8.5/10  Would of been a 9 or 10 if the game had just been longer when it came to the main story for me personally. I say def pick this game up when you can.   ",

            "review_text": "Deus Ex Mankind Divided shows the price of success. When Human Revolution was made, the team and budget was moderately large, which allowed them to take risks. Following the original Deus Ex as a template, they made a new story that followed every beat of the original, creating the perfect entry point for new players, while still retaining everything older fans enjoyed. It was better than I dared hope. But this success caused the budget for Mankind Divided to balloon. Early on they announced the team for the sequel would be 4x the size of the last game, which made me nervous. Bigger budget means more executive meddling. And that’s exactly what happened here.  The biggest problem with Mankind Divided is how it was mandated to be “the second part of a trilogy”. We don’t know at what part of development Square Enix came into the Eidos Montreal offices and made this decision for them, but it’s clear the developers weren’t up to the task of making a great middle part of a story. Like Mass Effect 2, it’s all setup, and no payoff. It makes the whole game feel pointless. Even though I had a great time playing it, the sense that it wasn’t leading to anything has a huge impact on the perceived value of the time spent here. It’s easily the longest Deus Ex game, taking me 10 hours longer to finish than Human Revolution, but it’s the least efficient in its use of time. And despite all this, I still feel like recommending the game!  For all the structural flaws on display here, it also shows they were genuinely trying to one-up the last game in every way they could. Taking place mostly in a single city hub this time, it takes notes from The Witcher in how consequences of side quests return to haunt you in later parts of the game. It adds to a sense of cohesion. The level design is also accommodating to your whims, as there’s alternative paths and solutions all over the place. You almost can’t take a wrong turn, as areas in latter parts of the game feel a bit like swiss cheese with how there’s doors, windows and vents all over. To some this might be a negative, as it makes it easier. But I found it pleasant to have more solutions than I knew what to do with.  The thing I enjoyed most in the game is how cohesively it blends sneaking, exploration and dialog. Like the original Deus Ex, the game tries to create story consequence from all your controller inputs, whether they be movement, action or picking dialog options. It isn’t wholly successful at it, but the attempt goes a long way to making the game have a sense of meaning to everything that happens. You’re not “taken out of the game” whenever a dialog scene occurs, as it’s so tightly integrated into everything else that the thought never occurs that it shouldn’t be there. The “social boss fights” return in this game, and the way they’re integrated into dialog scenes is more ambitious than the last game. Here half a scene can play out like a normal RPG dialog scene, and then the characters break out into an argument, and the scene shifts to the social boss battle system. There’s more sequences like this than I expected, and the way they’re integrated into the whole feels natural. This cohesion extends to how levels are designed, as the game can often give you progression options that utilize any of the tools available. It’s no doubt living up to the idea of what a Deus Ex game should be. It isn’t like other RPGs. This is a kind of blend of elements that you can’t get anywhere else.  At the same time you can’t escape the feeling it’s only doing certain things half way, like the concept of a mechanical apartheid. Augmented humans aren’t trusted in this world, and the government tries to limit contact between augmented and non-augmented as much as it can. You have park benches with “naturals only” written on them, and separate lines in subway stations. Playing as an augmented human, you’re harassed by police if you walk through the human lines in the subway. But beyond that there isn’t much else the game does to remind you of your oppression during normal play. In dialog people might be ♥♥♥♥♥ to you, but if you enter establishments for naturals only, nobody bats an eye. To some extent I can see why they limited the harassment you experience, as it would’ve been a pain in the ♥♥♥ to play. But at the same time that would’ve communicated the story of the world much more powerfully. Instead it’s a bit unclear just how distrusting the world really is, as you can go hours without feeling the sting of discrimination, in a game where it’s the most prominent theme of the story.  The side quests are the highlight of the game. There aren’t a lot of them, but because of that they’re all very high quality, and provide the greatest variety in the game. Here’s where the themes of discrimination are most clearly communicated, as you come across political scandals involving augmentations, people whose expired visas might send them to a mechanical ghetto, and so on. There’s even a quest where Adam Jensen gets to do traditional police work. This is something I found particularly delightful as even the very first Deus Ex reminded you at points that you’re actually supposed to be a cop, but circumstances in the games have always been so extraordinary that you never got to act like one, until now. If you’re going to play the game, absolutely try to do every side quest you can, as they’re the highlight of the game. They’re also the only stories in the game that are self contained, with proper conclusions to their arcs.  If you enjoyed any of the previous Deus Ex games, Mankind Divided is an easy recommendation. It feels odd to have a game where I could list things it did wrong for ages, but still have a generally favorable opinion. When playing I often found myself wishing other big budget games would be more like this. They had a full writing staff working on the game from the start together with the rest of the development team, so every action you take in the game feels like it “belongs” in the game in a way it rarely does in other high budget titles. As much as I liked Uncharted 4 or The Witcher 3 Blood and Wine, they were just the same thing again, except with a new story. Deus Ex Mankind Divided feels like progress. It might have more game modes than necessary, and a story that goes nowhere, but it also takes steps forward in areas where it counts. Here’s hoping they manage to fight off the nervous executives more effectively for the next game.",

What they did to this game is really something disgusting. But putting that apart, this game is true Deus Ex experience.  Semi-open world - check Locations full of life and secrets to explore - check Deep lore - check Intriquing story - check Interesting characters - check Multiple gamestyle choices - check RPG elements - check Awesome OST - check Attention to detail - check  The attention to detail in this game is just crazy, designers really outdone themselves in my opinion. Locations are literally beautifull and truly full of life. Appartments look like real appartments, streets are dirty and facilities full of machines. I may be little biased since I live in Czech republic, seeing and hearing my native language is really sweet, but I am trying not to be. Just the fact the devs went through the trouble to actually implement it is showing how detailed and real the experience actually is.  Now for the cons: There sure are some bugs and glitches, namely when moving objects/bodies of npcs. Controls could be much smoother, especially cover system and item interactions seem to be somewhat unresponsive. Some areas tend to suffer from fps drops (one was serious, others not so much) and overall performance could be improved.   This review will be edited once I advance through the game further, but so far, I certainly don´t regret buying it. I won´t go so far to say this is the best game of the year or something like that, but it is a great game, great game that will hopefuly get more polished with patches and will be remembered as a worthy successor to Deus Ex franchise.",

Also the level design has seen a step up too and there is a lot of different approaches to take for each mission. The game mostly takes place in Prague but its a really interesting hub to explore and gets more interesting to explore as the game progresses.  The main story is average at best and has a few interesting points to it but overall falls flat and ends rather abruptly. I assume Square Enix is saving some extra content for DLC or the game was released before it was completed, story-wise at least because the gameplay feels complete. Were the game really shines is in the side missions, which are some of the best I've experienced in an RPG since the Witcher 3. The side missions are usually multi-part and take place across the span of the main story, most of them have really good payoffs story-wise.  The Graphics are good and it runs really well on medium settings on my AMD Radeon R9 390X 8GB, I could probaly play the game on High settings just fine but I hold off on that due to my CPU's heat output. Also the music is as amazing as you expect, which makes sense since the music in Human Revolution was good too.   So Overall Mankind Divided is a good game that could have been close to perfect if the story was more fleshed out and there was more than one hub world to explore. If you liked Human Revolution and want to play more of that but with more interesting augments to play around with than give Mankind Divided a buy.",

Sometimes i encounter bad texture or flicking textures but this happened 1 time so far and I dont have problems with crashes and mouse acceleration. Map is quite big (didnt get into dubai yet) and you can enter a lot of houses and spend a lot of hours just going throught city and exploring. For people who cant speak czech it is not as fun as for me for example because they cant understand some voices and posters. There are a lot of new augmentations as you get through the story and they are great addition to the game.  I think its worth the full price anyway and if you dont like microtransactions, they dont make that much difference and dont buy them. (you wont even notice them as you play) I havent even played the new mode and DLC (for preorder) yet so this rating will be only for the story - 9/10 :)",

I wish the game had more side quests, because exploring the city is the best part of the game.  Gameplay is really well improved over Human Revolution as I remember it. The enviroment gives a lot of choice for stealth, and the controls for the game are fairly tight. Didn't like using the function keys for augments, but you might be able to change that as I didn't try.

While it's true that you don't need to spend an extra cent to get through the game it doesn't excuse the store's existence.  Now that that's over:  If you are a DX fan then you cannot go wrong witht his game. It improves on just about every aspect of DX:HR and you can tell that Eidos Montreal really understand what makes DX special and they have put a lot of heart into this game. The visual themes and attention to detail are here. The complex and multi-route level design is as good as ever with an impressive amount of verticality. Steath is still the best option and some of the new augs let give you even more choices than before when it comes to sneaking through the world.  I clocked about 35 hours for the main game if you include all the side missions and exploration. I do see how it's pretty obvoius that some content was ripped out to make DLC. (I'm looking at you Desperate Measures!) But the core gameplay is still long enough to justify the price. One giant caveate to that is that maybe 2 hours of that time was spent running back and forth between districts in the game (Via Subway loading screen) which seems like a cheap way to extend the playtime without adding much content.  Go play it!  Addendum: Screw Breach Mode!  I really want to get 100% of the acheivements and I cannot because the dificulty in breach just keeps going up and up until all the enemies are becoming giant bullet sponges.

I also give a thumbs down to Square Enix, though. Yes, the microtransactions doesn't affect the single player, but to me it looks like they forced Eidos to create Breach mode for the solely purpose of selling IAP. That developing times could have been used for the story mode instead.  I still didn't finished the game, but I played it for 25 hours (non violent run) and I'm enjoying it a lot. Yes, the story is less epic than in HR but playing a Deus Ex with today's graphics and the extra augs compensate for that. The art direction is awesome as always. If you are the kind of gamer that every once in a while stops to admire the art in the game you won't be disappointed. I love the attention to detail. You can explore every item in the inventory and the level of detail it's amazing. It's totally useless but it shows the game was made with love.  I like that the game is much more stealth friendly. For example, most weapons have no lethal ammo and some of the new augs makes stealth game a breeze (remote hacking is great). In the other way, violent gameplay it's also much improved. Guns feels a lot better than in HR and like with stealth gameplay, some new augs makes violent gameplay more interesting. Gun modding on the go it's also a great feature.  On the downside I wish they added another hub, but at least you revisit Prague at nightime and Golem, while not a hub, it's quite big. I spent around 4 hours there. Also, as many reviewers stated, facial details are quite inconsistent and many times animations are awkward and exagerated.  My recommendation, explore the hubs, talk to everyone, but before leaving an area check online where you can find sidequests, because some of them are quite hidden, some are more interesting than the main story. While I'm ok with non handholding I think that there should be some icons to indicate where you can get the sidequests. It's a shame so many people is going to miss these great stories.  To sum it up, if you liked Human Revolution you're going to enjoy this game. It's more of the same but improved in many areas.",

The run time for the game is roughly 20 hours, and that's including all the side missions I found, which were also really well done. Main story is alright. Nothing super impressive but it was engaging for me. Concerning the extra content, the DLC mission was not impressive at all and mostly dissapointing. It felt linear and very breif with not much of a pay off. Breach seems alright. I haven't dabbled in it much, but it gives you more levels to work through if you enjoy the gameplay in a very minimalistic art style.  All in all there isn't much here, but what is here is actually really good for the most part.  I did run into a few issues however, some more annoying than others. First and foremost is framerate drops when traversing large areas of the hub. Rather annoying but it was bearable for the most part. Secondly, I encountered rather long loading times between areas of the hub or even returning to the main menu. Towards the end of my experince I resulted to Alt+F4ing out of the game cause it was simply faster than waiting to get back to the main menu. Thirdly, for whatever reason I could not run up stairs. It was rather annoying, especially has time went on, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. Fourth and final, pre-rendered custscenes would just straight up freeze. I assume it ties into the long loading times. As the cutscene is winding down but a level hasn't loaded yet it has to stop the cutscene so the level can load in time. Rather jarring and immersion breaking, but it didn't happen frequent enough to be a problem.  My final thoughts are that, unfortunately, this is an inevitable 'pick it up on sale'. It's so great in many aspects, but it's so over priced for what it offers the player. As a fan of the series I don't have remorse for purchasing it at full price, but I do regret buying up the season pass, as the content it offers is really insubstaintal and not worth the asking price. If you're on the fence, avoid spoilers as best you can and wait until winter where it goes on sale. $40 seems like a fair price for what I played.  I did my best to keep this brief and to the point, I'm typically not a fan of reading long winded steam reviews.

            "review_text": "This review might be somewhat scattered, but it is as spoiler-free as possible.  According to old rumors and recent developments, MD is supposed to be the first part of a trilogy, so the story mainly focuses on setting up many plot-lines for the future games. And has a smaller scope compared to HR. While not a bad thing in and of itself, it does make the story seem shorter and the ending will probably make you go 'oh, that was it?', despite the fantastic final sequence. Perhaps the worst part of it all, Eidos are still pushing the silly augs vs normies conflict. I didn't mind it the first time around, but why go through the same thing again? This isn't Deus Ex. What stands out however, in my opinion, are the background conspiracies. Things that you can only piece together yourself from terminals, pocket-secretaries and throw-away lines. The game is rife with them. Sidequests of the game's second half really shine as well. Old-fashioned murder mysteries, tin-foiled conspiracy nuts, bank infiltrations and touching reunions - what's better, right? And you'll find plenty of references to the original Deus Ex. Mostly done tastefully.  The main and side characters are a bit of a mixed bag. The Council of Five is in their prime; King Bob, as usual, steals every scene he's in; Eliza is always there to provide you with fair and unbiased news reports, quite like this review.  Embracing what he became and no longer driven by revenge and his ex-girlfriend who may or may not be worse than Hitler, Jensen is given more characterization. As well as something else. But the new support cast is not quite as likeable as it was in HR... which can be viewed as a framing device. 'Everybody Lies' is more applicable now than ever - and the characters that you can't trust fully are quite outstanding and well-written. Unfortunately, some other completely secondary characters happen to be old, used tropes or just painfully bland, like Vega. Vega was a mistake.  Gameplay is outstanding all around. Non-lethal playstyles got new tools to make them more fun than restrictive, lethal ones have found new ways of causing carnage. CASIE has introduced a couple of new dialogue features. Stellar level design makes actual, proper stealth (as in, avoiding the enemy, instead of quietly taking them out) far more fluid as well. Multitools make a comeback, adding to options, without breaking anything. Prague as a hub is filled to the brim with nooks, crannies and sassy home security systems that are simply begging for Jensen's attention. In a single hub you will find more content than in both Detroit and Hengsha combined.  Performance is crappy, just crappy. FPS holds up fine, but the hubs tend to stutter for me, sometimes pretty badly. I suspect this has something to do with the new engine. PC version in particular has a couple of rather unique issues, at the moment, like the save limit nonsense. The release has been messy, even if it's nothing that can't be fixed in time.   Microtransactions are in the game. There can be no excuse for pulling this crap, especially in an AAA title. From what I understand, this is on Squeenix. I didn't ask for this, the players didn't ask for this and I certainly hope Eidos didn't either. Thanks a lot, Squeenix. At the very least, the game isn't designed with them in mind.   It's not perfect, and the suits at Square-Enix are trying really hard to sabotage it, but so far they haven't succeeded. Overall, a 8.5 /10 and a good contender for my personal GOTY. Eidos did a fine job.",

I havr always enjoyed these games and this genre of game that being said it may not be for you even though the hipe. So my overall score 8.5 out of 10 so far for what it is ....what it is not is cod or battlefield or some other crap fps that only has 10 hours of story if your lucky.",

One playthrough took me a solid 30+ hours, and I didn't even do that much world exploration; that's just how long it takes to complete it while doing all of the side-missions. One or two side missions did feel a bit boring (just because they didn't do anything to advance the game's plot or its associated universe, in any way), but no complaints otherwise. The actual ending felt a bit flat, but the scene after credits made up for absolutely everything. Sure, I wish *that* was the actual ending of the game (with an actual boss battle built around it), but I'll take whatever I can get. Overall the story was okay, and I have very high hopes for the sequels/DLC, after watching that cutscene.  I'd also like to make a note of how much I despise the game's monetization team. They take something wonderful and try their best to ruin it, with their annoying business-school tricks. Rest assured I shan't be buying any of their $1 Praxis kits. I also strongly believe the ending of the story would've been constructed in a far better way, had they not needed to chop up the material so they can still have enough leftover content to push into the game's DLC. I wish someone would sell them a roofless house, or perhaps a car without a driver's seat. The seat comes in the DLC; for now, all you get is a moderately soft pillow.",

'At minimum spec, which is a HD 7870 2GB or GTX 660 2GB, paired with an Core i3-2100, we aim to give you an average of 30 fps, at 1280*720 resolution, but this is at the low quality preset.

I have an i7, geforce GTX 980 Ti, 16 GB, SSD, 1440p.

It's a shame it's not the cyberpunk god emperor that I was hoping it to be, but mechanics wise it's alot better than it's predecessor. Besides, when you think about it Human Revolution's plot wasn't that special either. It started very strong as did Mankind Divided but then it just died towards the end. With all the Mankind Divided trailers it kinda painted the picture that you would be in contact with Marchenko alot more and that you would end up having to choose from between the Juggernaut Collective, Arc and TF29 but instead of having proper triple agent action it's all just 'do a choice so you can talk to one of two people'. Because the storytelling is very linear with lore drops here and there, it is very easy to piece together the coming 'plot twists' before it occurs.  Deciding whether to buy the game is easy. Want gameplay? Buy it. Want plot? Don't buy it.",

Pros: Great world building/environment,wonderful and fitting soundtrack/ sound design, expansive hub area that is fun to explore and navigate, fun gameplay if you go stealthy. Anytime I played lethally without stealth, the game turns into this awful and clunky FPS that isn't very fun.  Cons: Rather bland and boring gameplay if you go full lethal and play it like a FPS. (Only five minutes of playing this way to be fair.) Half-baked story, it isn't awful but I found it disappointing considering the cool world they have crafted, definitely feels like the publisher made the devs cut the last chapter of the game off to sell as DLC.  If you want a dark and moody cyberpunk adventure with fun stealth gameplay and great world building I say go for it. If any of common negatives you have been reading about make you worry I suggest waiting for it to go on sale with all of the DLC because I swear a few bits of this game were chopped off to make more money (shocker!).

It has a high replicability with a chance to find something new each time, let alone the different choices you can make. Long review below.   This was a Deus Ex game delivered, thank you to the deves that put this together. The only short comings I have about this game is it felt short. I put in 57 hours to run my first time through. But the game craters delivered us a Deus Ex game. The levels were crafted beautifully, with more than enough ways to complete an objective, keeping very true to the Deus Ex we have come to love. I cannot wait to see how the rest of the story is going to unfold. I am very happy with they are trying in the original game with these. There are a lot of things falling into place. As for the ending I felt it held true to Deus Ex, now does that feel like a mass effect ending yes. But if you look back it is how the first game ended. Is there a better way to go about it I believe so, but would I judge it on that alone, no as I have said may times before it felt just like a Deus Ex game through and through. I would recommend buying this if you are a fan of the game or even if it’s your first time buying into the series. All in all a 4 out of 5, only missing that last point because it felt short.   A final note for just saying it to be said, the micro transactions were a little much for PC users. As for consoles it was a great idea to let those gamers who do not have access to wonderful moding tools have access to more points or credits they would otherwise not have.  ",

No matter what your playstyle, there are still questlines which require stealth and quiet takedowns, especially in Chapter 13. There are still side quests I've only seen hints of and haven't activated, but I've unlocked every augmentation, though it's possible to do well with a limited subset of them. This seems like half the game DX:HR was in terms of both locations and number &amp; variety of quests, so let's hope that the coming DLC releases, as well as the additional 'Jensen Stories' single mission quests make up for this.  I upgraded my system to 32G ram and a 4G GFX Geforce 970 card for the second playthrough, and the improvement from 10-30fps (with an old GFX Geforce 680 on low settings) to 60fps on high was dramatic (65 max on the Benchmark), especially in the rainy scenes late game. So if you're thinking about an upgrade, this would be the time to go for it.  Most of you know by now that the story is intentionally incomplete. Naturally Eidos Montreal is tight lipped about its plans, but the relative brevity of the game does suggest that there is more -- possibly much more -- to come. If this turns out to be the case, I'll be happy. Otherwise, however attractive the game is visually, and however much fun the gameplay is, there just isn't enough of it.",

The art direction is phenomenal and possibly the coolest looking sci fi world ive seen in a game. Obvious inspiraiton from Blade Runner. The soundtrack too is fantastic. Absolutely great sci fi soundtrack that fits with the feel and aesthetic of the game. So off the bat you have excellent gameplay, amazing art direciton, and a fantastic soundtrack.

So why am I recommending it even though I have all these negative things to say? Well quite simply because it is a Deus Ex game and it is a good game underneath it all. But you have really got to be in to it so that you will look for all the alternative routes (there are a lot of these) or trying to find a way of doing something without just outright killing everyone.

Good thing, too, because turns out it's a bit lacking. Don't get me wrong - it's still a good game. It's still Deus Ex. But it's missing something.  I think one big failure of this game was to set the whole thing in Prague. It just doesn't have the same kind of cyberpunk mystique of New York, Hong Kong or Hengsha. And it's not the fault of Prague as a city - it's the fault of the level designers. Dreamfall Chapters was also set in a futuristic Prague, but that looks and feels way more exciting. But perhaps the level designers were hemmed in by a storyline, which - barring the opening scene and final level - is inexplicably almost entirely set in one town. That's not the Deus Ex we know and love. Where are the black helicopters flying me all over the world? There's barely even a conspiracy - no betrayals, no suspense, no moral questioning - the bad guys are the bad guys are the bad guys. This is the most pedestrian Deus Ex yet, storywise.  Fortunately, there are side missions. And the side missions make the game. There are some awesome creepy cults and freaks and serial killers and AIs that evoke all the best parts of the original Deus Ex and Human Revolution. There aren't any stupid boss fights (well, except in the main mission, which we already established sucks). There is dark comedy, tragedy, seediness and sleaze hiding in the gaps, if you look for it. You can sneak around and hack stuff and stun people and yay. The game gives you way more power-ups than you could ever hope to use (i finished the game with 20+ unused praxis and tons of grenades and hacking softwares), but just ignore the built-in God mode and you will probably have a great time.  Quick word of warning if you have a slow hard disk or slow internet connection - changing areas has a load time of 10+ minutes on my machine, and whenever you quit the game (or it crashes) you won't be able to play it again for an hour or so while the savegames sync to Steam. Probably not a problem if you have an SSD and fast internet, but i do not.  Overall it's a fun game. It's worth the money. But it's definitely a step backwards from Human Revolution. I just hope Eidos Montreal get whoever wrote the side missions this time gets to write the main mission next time. Oh yeah, and lose Adam Jensen. He's a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. ",

Gameplay advice: Play once as killbot, it's easier, then do a New Game+ which starts you with all your existing augs and do stealth - it'd be tedious to finish your augs in just one game, but you can easily do it in the NG+.   Make sure you get the dismantle aug to turn spare stuff into crafting materials, and GET TESLA - it is so OP, and useful for kill or no kill. Then you can make your own tesla ammo with the dismantle.

This game actually adds some pretty cool new features such as an improved cover mechanic as well as new augments that can actually completely alter your experience and playstyle.

It's plot is a middle entry esque adventure, utilizing something more localized and character building while also setting up the next game to be bigger, better, and likely Jensen's finale.  The thing is, not all stories can be about being a 'world saver'. If anything, it is refreshing in story terms since most of the series deals with such scenarios while this builds up to an epic finale for the Jensen sub-trilogy, like mass effect 2 did for 3.  Heck, outside of turning off the signal, Jensen failed. The illuminati is still in control, though as shown by 1, Page will surpass them with Majestic 12. Megan joins versalife and likely leads the efforts in creating either the gray death, the Denton gene therapy projects, or both. Augmentations are seen as monstrous, being widely discriminated against. The tyrants may be dead, zhao as well, but they were mere pawns to the illuminati and easily replaceable so he didn't even accomplish hurting their power base. He saw the most success in the missing link doc if you think saving both the prisoners and the scientist is the canon ending.  All of the main deus ex games can be described as certain moments for civilization.  1: the fall of civilization  Invisible war: the rebirth of civilization  Human revolution: the renaissance of civilization Mankind divided: the sickness of civilization  And the next will likely be: the decay of civilization.  As prequels, anything before the original will end, at best, in a bittersweet manner. We know the end result.  As for locations, while Prague and Golemn city may be the only major locations, they are far more detailed and explored than Detroit and hengsha were. And there were multiple choices for handling the final boss, like blocking his signal or so. Unlike the human revolution or the previous games, where you generally had to just shoot them.  Gameplay has been further refined to be better form, with an even greater set of possibilities to utilize in finishing missions and exploration. Music is engrossing and a pleasure to listen to. The world building is top notch complimented by some damn good environments.  the game plays smooth as silk and has no immersion design issues. Do bugs exist on the engine? Yes, but the eidos team is quick to pick up the slack of nixxes.  The game is designed superbly, with many missions and side missions having a plethora of ways to tackle them that not even the first game would've thought about at times. Your actions have consequences and many events in the story can be resolved in a wide array of ways.  And for the whole microtransaction issue: It is literally invisible in regards to the game, merely existing as a cheap (if dubios) manner for more impatient players to simply pay their way to a point that they could reach if they'd just play the game. Some like to say 'I remember when cheats were free and in the game' and I say 'I remember when a game didnt cost 30 million to make'  Don't condemn the Eidos team for the mistakes of Square Enix, who are quickly becoming the EA of Japan.",

This review is also focused on the Main Story, not any of the side content (yet) besides for Jensen's Story: Desperate Measures.  So I had just finished Deus Ex: Mankind Divided on 'Give me a Challenge' (Normal) difficulty and had been a fan of the series since Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Let me say the game is great. It takes all good aspects from Human Revolution, polishes them, and adds to them. But there is a 'con' (if you could call it that) which may surprise some people.  The gameplay is similar to Human Revolution, you have a city hub, this time Prague, and you can explore it freely doing main missions, side missions, Points of Interest (new addition), or whatever you would like. Looking around the city, hacking into control panels, and finding loot is all the same as Human Revolution. The tutorial is good and will teach peopl ethe mechanics of the game in an interesting way, using tutorial spaces where you can try out augmentations and weapons without consequence. But let me talk about consequences.  The Deus Ex series is known for it's decision-making in it's story. Mankind Divided is no different. There will be some tough decisions to make in the story of the game. This time, it is two years after the events of Human Revolution, once again as Adam Jensen. You come to Prague only for the train station to be bombed. The game also has a 12 minute catch up movie if you haven't played Human Revolution, but I highly suggest you go out and play Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut for the experience.  Now, what is the 'con'? It has one of the same cons as Deus Ex: The Fall. The ending. WHAT?! The ending is bad?! No, it is a ending depending on the choices you make, my ending was pretty good. But, the ending has a cliffhanger that looks like it wants to set up either a Season Pass or a sequel (the latter would be awesome!). Now this may sound boring, but watch the credits and mid-way through, you'll see what I mean.  Rating: 9/10-Awesome Rating for Deus Ex fans: 10/10-Legendary  Jensen's Stories: Desperate Measures Review:  I'll summarize it without spoilers. You go through a conversation, given 15 Praxis Kits, infiltrate a company's HQ, get some information, and get out. It took about 30 minutes for me to complete with stealth, which makes it have good replay value for speedrunners. If you got it for free (like me) with the Pre-Order, I guess you cannot complain. I won't give it a rating because I did get it for free (if you consider a Pre-Order bonus free). Worth playing if you had completed the Main Story.",

By the third time revisiting Prague, I was getting tired of running around in the same old place. A couple of side missions in particular made me go between districts a few too many times. Human Revolution had Detroit and Hong Kong, enough to stay fresh throughout. Other than that, the gameplay and story are excellent and kept me interested and wishing the game wasn't ending. I'm pretty sure I completed just about every mission possible in my first playthrough so it took a while and was worth it. Eidos Montreal is doing a great job.  Yes, the credit and praxis packs are stupid. I blame SE for that nonsense. They have no place in a full priced single player game. However, they were easy to ignore so besides looking at them once to say 'wow, that's stupid', it made no difference to me. The preorder packs being consumable is also stupid, but again, had no effect on how I played the game. I think a lot of the DLC issues are exaggerated as they have no effect on the game if you choose not to buy them. I didn't pay any extra for the preorder stuff so I don't care too much. I didn't experience any interruptions because of DRM so I can't comment on that. Not as intrusive as Hitman.  Overall, it's a good game if you ignore the DLC. I can understand being upset if you paid for a one time use DLC, but it doesn't matter if you don't buy them.   8/10",

Yes it crashed once… actually, twice. Just now as I’m writing this review actually. But you know what, I don’t care! The devs patch whatever problems there are. S**t happens. Get over it.  Simply put. If you’re a Deus Ex fan, GET IT! If you enjoy the cyberpunk, futuristic theme, get this game! It’s a shooter. Its stealth combat. Customizing weapons, minor crafting, upgrades and augs… I love it!  Micro transactions = The cost of doing business goes up. Inflation is a b***h. Own or operate a business for 5 to 10 years and you’ll understand. The cost of a cheese burger 10 to 15 years ago, isn’t the same as it is now. Should these gaming companies raise the cost of their games to $70 or $80 to compensate for the costs of doing business? Most likely no one would buy them (look at the reviews). So the other option is to find the money elsewhere. I have no problem paying $5 ot $10 dollars extra for something I enjoy. You can’t put a price on happiness and entertainment. Deus Ex still a complete game. If you don’t want to drop the $5 dollars, then don’t. But don’t knock this game because a business is trying to increase profits. Unfortunately, not all developers are like CD Projekt Red. And unfortunately, not everyone understands business. And unfortunately, not everyone has an extra $5. I get it.

Gameplay:  The Gameplay in Mankind Divided is similar to other Deus Ex games, offering a wide variety of ways to complete each objective ranging from silently hacking your way through doors never to be seen to gunning down every cop, merc, civilian and door that stands between you and your objective as a literal living war machine. Edios has greatly improved the dialoge interactions between Adam and NPCs in terms of animations. Characters stand and gesture naturally while expressing facial animations that are greatly improved over Human Revolution. When Adam turns off his sunglasses, you can really see the emotions in his pretty, green, robot eyes. Voice acting is very well done, although generic characters tend to have repeat voice actors. However, there is sometimes a delay between when you pick a dialoge option, when adam actually says it, and when the NPC responds. Not a deal breaker, but worth noting.   The Story:  Like many of the 'Do not reccomend' reveiws will tell you, the story is in no way as expansive as Human Revolution, which was a bit disappointing, but, in my opinion, not a reason to pass on this game. Here's why. While very contained, Prauge is a very very very detailed overworld. Compared to Detroit and Hangsha from Human revolution, it is a much more immersive and detailed world, that changes depending where you are in the story. NPCs will be having a plethora of different conversations at a cafe that, depending on the owner, may not serve you because you're a cyborg. While I really wish I would've gotten to spend more time in Golem City, London and go and find Janus, what the central plot lacks in story, the game makes up in side missions. If all you do is the main story, you're probably going to be upset. The side missions are really worth checking out, some even have parts that span over time as the main plot progresses, and bring up things that eventually could be crucial to the main story. Yes, the ending really could have been stronger than seeing Eliza Cassan's biased reading the of the missions you chose to do, but if you want to know what happens after Human Revolution and play a Deus Ex game, you're gonna want to get it. I enjoyed all the stories for what they were.   The Controls  It's worth noting the controls are slightly different in Mankind Divided, for the worse in my opinion. RMB is now iron sights and cover is now a toggled F key. Fire from cover (To spook enemies) is gone and you have to peek out to shoot, getting hit. Controls in menus/hacking is obviously a second thought in the PC port. You have to use WASD to scroll around in hacking and select a node, and the different software menues are really obtrusive and get in your way, often causing you to click on nuke software you didn't want to use. On the Map, you have to use WASD or click and drag to scroll the map under a fixed crosshair to see objectives and details. Mousing over a waypoint does nothing. Also, the mouse seems to be accelerated, and I had to turn sensitivity down both in game and on my mouse's DPI. If you want to select a previous mission, you cannot click on it, you must scroll with WASD. While Nixxes did a fantastic job with the performance of the port itself (the graphics, engine, ect) the controls are terribly optimised for PC and were clearly designed with consoles in mind. The controls are easily the worst thing about this game.   The Graphics  The game is gorgeous. If you have the hardware, running it with ultra textures and high quality lighting really is something. I know I said I wouldn't get into it, but Demanding =/= poorly optimized. I have a pretty great rig (at the time of writing, lol) and I can't max it out. Turn of MSSA (Under display, not graphics) and turn down advanced lighting, texture filtering and cloth physics if you want to maximize performance with higher textures.   Breach Mode:  I'll be honest, I haven't really played with breach yet, so I have no right to talk about it.",

            "review_text": "First of all, I'd give this game an overall rating of 6/10 for now... If the devs improve some major flaws in the controls and graphical settings, then this can easily get a 8 or even 9 out of 10.  Let get straight to the point. If you are a big fan of DXHR, then this is definitely worth getting.   The story is great! It is exactly the type of the story you'd expect for a sequel. The only down side is that the game is way too short. You literally did one thing and the story is over, it has too many questions unanswered and gives off an unsatisfying finish when you beat it. But nevertheless, a good story is a good story, it receives 9/10.  Grahical problems are a big problem with Deus Ex. I'm pretty sure I have a pretty good rig to run this game, but nope, when it runs on high quality, it was fine until big fights, then it is unplayable. I turned it down to medium, it has exactly the same problem. Then I changed it to low, turn off everything, nope, this problem is still there.... Cutscene lags when subtitle is on... Just walking on the street, you'd get minor freeze from time to time... Everything you do, you start with a stutter... WTH.... And the answer I got from the devs are that we are asking for unrealistic demand? Seriously? One of my friend tried to play this on high with his 3000 dollar alienware, and you guessed it, it has similar problem and he is forced to play on low for a smooth gameplay... But not all hope are lost, the low quality is actually somewhat decent, so until we get a fix on this, you just have to play on low settings.... Graphics gets 3/10  The controls are a bit wanky, but once you get a hang of it, it plays out fine. Several problems do exist. 1) Mouse acceleration. A lot of ppl are really mad at the mouse acceleration problem at day 1, but this is already fixed. 2) Single key has way too many functions. For example, you are trying to move a body, when you hold E, the game just opens up the mission log or pocket secretary, this is really annoying and it is still not fixed. 3) Ability control is a mess. This is PC ffs, we have F1 to F12, why are we limited to only five ability at a time? Overall, control receives 5/10.  The Combat feels way more intense than the previous game because you can actually put attachments onto your wepaon(for example snipe ppl with your combat rifle) and also the new augs are just amazing. Instead of running pure stealth build or pure loud build, you can actually carry everything with you and just do a mixture of both. Loud weapon received some much needed nerf when equiped with silencer so it actually make sense now. The only thing that needs improvement is the number of enemies. I just beat the game on the highest difficulty, even then, it feels pretty easy because I can just stay in cover and peek out to do quick headshots. AIs do flank you from time to time, but there is just not enough of them to force you to stay on the move. Combat receives 8/10  And here is what everybody is whining about the game, microtransactions. TBH, it doesn't bother me at all, microtransactions are there for ppl who needs it. You don't like it, don't buy it. You get more than enough credit and praxis point if you just explore a lot and sell stuff back to the vendors, but for players who just want to enjoy the game as much as they want, they don't mind spending some lunch money to they can enjoy the game right off the bat. I don't get why ppl are so mad about this, it's a singleplayer game, why force others to follow the way you think or play?",

MTs have no effect on the game AT ALL if you ignore them.  Original review:  Excellent game! I did a non-leathal/stealth playthrough in about 21 hrs and got all of the side missions (I think)  Exellent story, visuals ae (mostly) great and all the different ways to play are fun and rewarding in their own ways. (Working on a polar opposite NG+ playthrough right now)  Only downsides would be the loading times, bad lip-sync and having to run back and forth in the main city hub, forcing even more load times. Most of the time however, you have PLENTY to do once you travel to a new district so it isn't super bad. Overall, this is one of the few games to come out in recent memory that actually LIVES UP to it's $60 price tag. Can't wait for some more story DLC!  9/10",

The first intro mission isn't the best opening, as it leads you down a narrow path to serve as a brief tutorial mission, but after that, the game opens up and lets you tackle the game any way you want. The number of options available to you in every situation is astounding. You could replay the same mission 3 or 4 times and get a completely different experience. I'm probably gonna get 25-30 hours out of the single player game. I am doing all of the side missions. I haven't touched breach mode yet, but will definitely give it a try.   As for the performance issues some people are complaining about, the only thing I can say is that this is a very demanding game. It looks absolutely gorgeous, and you can do almost anything in it. You can open most doors, pick up almost any object, kill any NPC.. it's quite impressive that the game looks as good as it does considering the scope, and there are almost no loading screens on top of all of that. I have 2 gaming PC's, I'm playing this one on my living room PC, using a wireless Xbox 360 controller to get the 'console' experience. It's rocking a quad core i5 3470, 16GB RAM, 512GB Crucial SSD + 1TB HDD and a GTX 970. I'm running the game with everything on 'Very High' and it runs at around 45 fps on average, which isn't bad at all. My main rig is running the same specs, but with an i7 4790k.   Overall, I highly recommend it, and you can find it on the cheap on sites like ♥♥♥ &amp; CDKeys",

The gameplay is pretty much identical to Humanity Evolved. There are new augments, but I never even bothered using them. By the end of the game I had 6 Praxis that I hadn't spent and nothing really useful enough to be worth spending on. The gameplay is solid and the story is good.  My big complaint is how short the game felt. I finished the campaign in about 25 hours (normal difficulty) while finishing pretty much all of the side quests. There was only one side quest that I didn't finish and that one I chose not to finish because I didn't want to help the guy that gave it to me. The Deus Ex games all have deep levels of intrigue that you uncover as you go through the game. This one feels like it went one level deep before ending the game. There were so many leads that were just never explored. It feels like they meant to do more, but cut off production early.   I enjoyed the game, but I can't help but feel a little disappointed in it. Tentatively recommended, but don't pay full price, wait for at least 25% off.",

Some of you might spit on me for saying that but take some time to find it over. They added some 'DCL' to buy some weapons, yes it is bad to do so. But you don't have to buy those DCL. Noone forces you to do so. I think we should remind ourselves for all the good that Deus EX as brought as and not give a 'not recommanded' Because of these two DCL's. The game was sold at 49.99Euro were most of the games today are sold at 59.99 so we can forgive two 4.99euro DCL's. Move past this and look at the game they gave us. Don't fall into your emotions too quickly and judge them. Deux Ex is one of the best single player experience nothing has changed. Maybe since they sold the game a little cheaper and the game cost them a lot they want to make some extra money to give decent DCL's? The company that made Deus Ex isn't EA games or Ubisoft. They always gave us exactly what we wanted.

One thing I suggest to others is to take your time and enjoy it for what it is. The game will end before you know it and leave you with a kind of bittersweet feeling on how it ends, how fast it all went by, and how much fun the journey was. For me, a long time fan of the Deus Ex franchise, Mankind Divided is another great installment for the series. Is it a perfect game? No. Is it fun? Yes. Could it be longer? Yes. The only disappointment for me was the $60 price tag for a game that can be completed in 10-12 hours with not a whole lot of options to expand on the experience after the campaign ends. I've thought about doing new game plus or even trying the highly criticized Breach Mode, but I think for now, my experience with this game is done.   The one thing I am seeing a lot of in other comments and reviews of the game is that the existence of the much hated micro-transactions. Is this something new? No. Do you need to make purchases to be able to play or beat the game? No. Can I see how gamers, like myself, hate when we pay $60 for a game and then see micro-transactions in that same game? Of course. I guess with as many games that are coming out these days that include some sort of micro-transactions, I've become used to it.  My final recommendation of this game is that I would recommend it to friends. I would probably tell them to wait until you can pick it up on sale for around $30 due to the length and lack of content to keep you around after the story is over.",

Also, this is the first Deus Ex game I've played.  I liked it. A lot. It left me wanting more, clearly begging for a sequel. The gameplay and graphics are outstanding. However, I was disappointed how the game ended. Not only was it too short to justify the price tag, it didn't tie up any loose ends and hardly answered any questions.  This is one of those games that likes to reward you for going out of your way to unlock new areas. Exploration and hacking is encouraged in DE:MD. While the hacking may get old for some, I became quite good at it and didn't bother me as much once I upgraded my hacking augs.  There's a crafting system in this game. You can make useful things like health packs, biocells and automatic hacking tools. I never crafted a single thing. Instead, I used all my crafting parts to upgrade weapons. I had accumulated an abundance of the craftables just from exploring. I also only used one 'experimental aug' during my first play-through. The aug that allows you to slow-down time is useful when a cut scene ends abruptly and you need to take out three guys. Other than that, these augmentations seemed over-powered and, in most situations, unnecessary. I liked the idea of being able to change-up your play style according to the augs you select, but I really didn't think I would ever use them. I was sort of upset that Jensen is 90% machine yet doesn't have a flashlight. As far as graphics, this game is beautiful. The worlds are so filled-out and gloomy. It's magnificent. Very rarely did I feel like I was confined to a small map. The world really isn't that big, but there's so much to explore it didn't really matter. I think I only had two boss battles. One was a side mission, the other I cut short using a 'beat-the-game' item I found a few minutes prior. All around very disappointing and anti-climatic. I stocked-up in case I actaully need to battle some OP augmented dude but instead I seldom dug into my inventory unless it was to drop one of my useless health packs in exchange for ammo. Not worth the $60. Maybe I would pay $40 for it. I love it, but Square Enix could have done SO much more.  TL;DR: Awesome game; not worth the price.",

Inventory management is simple &amp; intuitive, no real problems navigating menus  COMBAT- is great...The SHOOTER mechanics are quite good, GLORIUS even if thats your style..with weapon enhancements, upgrades,AUGS etc, Weapons handle really well &amp; are very accurate.. Some people complained about the mouse acceleration but I just set it to low &amp; it was fine...no real problems If you prefer STEALTH then you wont be disapointed...It is entirely possible to GHOST your way through the whole game ..never being seen if you are good enough..   NPC dialog ...There is alot...You will spend a LONG time talking to NPC's to gather info or quests..Fortunately this is handled reasonably well ..I did find myself alittle bored by endless chatter with NPC's It would have been nice to get quests quicker...sometimes you have to wait through over 10 minutes of dialogue before you get something to do..seems like FILLER to me..    LEVEL DESIGN is good, lots of detail, alternative pathways, plenty of secret areas,  The Environments are VERY Realistic &amp; nice looking...   The CONS IMHO Quite a few BAD points, but I am not going to be too picky...Overall its ok...Just ok  The worst issues listed below.  First of all.. CAMPAIGN IS WAY TOO SHORT, ITS A THIRD AS LONG AS IT SHOULD BE..  Even If you take your time &amp; explore EVERYTHING ..you willl finish the ENTIRE game in UNDER 20 hours...  THE STORY MODE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 3 times longer at least...  Just when you really start to get interested in the game suddenly..its OVER... LAST MISSION ! You have done everything..been every where, explored every secret, talked to every NPC.. 20Hours MAX  Honestly, I found the story rather poor, Its definatly NOT a AAA+ story,..not by a long shot... The writing is mediocre at best, bland filler at worst!  Basicially ..One of the most 'meh' Stories that I have ever seen Its not very exciting or original.  Considering the fantastic potential that this universe dwells in...The Story SHOULD have been a highlight..but honestly its NOT...Its boring, bland &amp; unexciting... I dont know what they were doing here. The side missions are mostly filler that have no real bearing on anything, dont even expand the universe much at all or give you mediocre rewards.. Its a shame that they wasted such a great opportunity.... They could have done sooooo much better...  I am not being fussy....The story is really average...  Deus EX Human revolution story is MUCH MUCH better..and longer...  Also It feels you are wasted as a Super AGENT...mainly because MOST of the missions are kindof simple --GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B, either kill/incapicitate everything or dont kill or be seen at all.  Jensen is a also bit of a 'GLASS CANNON'.  THIS!!--&gt;The number of times you sneak into a secure area &amp; hack a TOP SECRET LVL 5 VAULT ..only to find either NOTHING at all or the tiniest reward is EMBARRASSINGLY HIGH. There is OFTEN NO REWARD FOR EXPLORING..  SOOO MANY EMPTY ROOMS!!!  ALSO....INVISIBLE WALLS WILL BLOCK YOUR EXPLORATION NEARLY EVERYWHERE..  I personally hate invisible walls...its bad design...   CRASHES Experienced quite a few Crashes...  People have said it often crashes on LOADING...  I found that if you wait..4-5 min it will load...but thats a LONG time when you want to PLAY!!   Occasional graphics gliches..rare but they did happen   Major BUG...DAY 1 DLC content for me Disappeared when I added it from STORAGE to INVENTORY AS soon as I transferred it..it was gone...I paid for full seasons pass &amp; NONE OF THE ITEMS actually worked in the game ..I lost all my BONUS Praxis points They just disappeared...not found in either my storage or Augs menu...  Ive contacted Support..hasnt been resolved in over a week..  Also on this bug...You can only swap the DLC items ONCE...so you better make sure you save your game as soon as you swap them over...This was broken for me...As soon as I swapped items over &amp; saved my game they disappeared altogether.. a waste of my time and money.  Still no word from Support..  This happens no matter which SAVE I chose to load  ANOTHER GAMEBREAKING BUG Speaking of reloading saves, here's Another issue. Other people have mentioned this as well and its quite frankly a really bad oversight by the Devs...it should have been picked up in the Playtesting because THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME...its a really BAD BUG  Go behind cover &amp; quicksave. Then reload that save. EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU RELOAD THE GAME FROM WITHIN COVER ..You'll jump over or out from whatever cover you're behind, because 'unknown reasons', right into the face of the enemy...You have no chance to stop it..its a really bad bug Some people say its because of the Space bar..being pressed while in LOAD menus.. when you press space on the loading screen to confirm the Load, the game thinks 'oh, you pressed space because you want to vault over that cover &amp; get shot to death, right?'.   its a user interface BUG  it happens every time...   should have been picked up by the Playtesters..  To avoid it happening you'll have to load an OLDER SAVE GAME &amp; not only wait insultingly long, but also lose progress.   Especially since this game is FULL Price....This bug should not be here...not in a AAA title.. it happens EVERY TIME..how the devs missed this bug is beyond me...its a Major gamebreaking bug..  MICROTRANSACTIONS.. Completely unneccesary...why even have these..its a FULL price game with expensive DLC.. The Devs are just MIlking us for money now.  Despite what people say..ITS NOT PAY TO WIN... you can easily finish the game on HARD MODE within 20 hours without breaking a sweat if you try.. The microtransactions do not affect the gameplay in any major way...  If you need to buy extra Praxis points then you are a crap player...  But honestly there is no real need for Microtransactions EVER...especially not in a single player game...especially not in a game of this TINY length...  You wont ever need to buy anything..so just ignore the microtransactions.. you are not forced to buy anything &amp; nothing you can buy will really affect gameplay that much...only make it a hundred times easier.. if you want 'really easy' then play on EASY mode..its that simple..  People have misreported the microtransactions.. but honestly they really shouldnt have put them in the game at all.. it just shows how greedy the Devs are.. Full price game AND expensive DLC AND microtransactions as well?  gimme a break..Eidos..   And Speaking of EASY.... Even on the HARDEST difficulty, its a cake walk  I have finished the game &amp; did not get hit or seen once....IT WAS FAR TOO EASY  OVERALL  I have had fun...The game is OK...Not very challenging but fun..   My biggest complaint is that The Campaign is far too short &amp; EASY  its barely 20 hours long...Just when you start to enjoy the game   its over,....and the credits roll and you are left thinking..  Wait did I miss something?  and  Where is the rest of the game?   otherwise a reasonble but also sub standard effort  I congratulate Eidos for going to the effort  BUT..  They really missed a great opportunity here to make something incredible..  They just didnt try that hard..  Which is a real shame    I hope they fix the bugs &amp; ADD ALOT MORE CONTENT..   I'll be damned if I give them one more cent...I've paid more than enough already..   Its 'NOT' a horrible game its just very SHORT &amp; has 'some' serious issues.  Overall Score..  7 out of 10   Its worth a buy if you like Deus ex...but you might be alittle shocked at what you get for your money..  Might be best to wait for a SALE!!...",

Microtransactions yes there is an ingame store that sells praxis but i have not used it once during single player yet and have not felt the need too either. So although a 60 dollar game should not have a microtransaction system AT ALL and the devs should be ashamed of themselves it does not affect gameplay in the slightest.  Next Up... Crashes I'm sure there are people out there that are having trouble running the game. I'm also sure a large percent are people with dinosaur computers or people trying to play with max settings on a card that cant handle it. I'm also sure there is a small percent of people maybe .25% that genuinly have a pc that can handle the game in all its glory and the game just wont work for them due to poor optimisation on the devs part or incompatible software for that very small percent I appologise, my game has crashes only twice but the game saves pretty regularly so i havnt had any significant progress loss in my game. All in all the game seems stable im running max settings on my gtx970 without any issues.  Finally... Gameplay What can i say another awsome dues ex game 8/10 looses 2 points for having microtransactions on a 60 dollar AAA title otherwise an outstanding game.",

The animation during conversations also seems to be broken. Which is lame because the conversations in this game are more crucial than ever.   What I like most and what makes it different from it's predecessor is that how you approach situations effects how the game later plays out.

I have about twenty hours registered but you can remove an hour or two from those twenty hours because I forgot to quit the game when I got something to eat. Anyway, maybe it's just me but I actually found the game to be very short. Let's say that it took me fifteen hours to get through the end game. Including side quests and plenty of dying and reloading on middle difficulty.  Once I got passed by the first mission, you go to some guy to fix your augs. Naturally, something goes wrong and you lose all your progress. Damn. But doing so, this guy discovers some serioussly advanced prototype tech. (important for later)  Anyway, once you get out of the conversation, I had twelve points!!! to apply as I wanted to. TWELVE! Maybe it was because of how i finished the previous mission, (i went stealth and knocked out every guy I could find) but still. Twelve points meant I could activate a LOT of augs to start with!  Anyway, the guy tells you that activating the prototype augs is very risky indeed and in order to fix that you need to acquire a certain item. Fast forward to when I got around to do it, this guy tells me that he's busy now and can't actually do something with it. I figured, okay fine. Fair enough. HOWEVER!!!  A LOT of time passes before this guy contacts you again. in fact, it's near the end game where you can activate any of them without consequence after this guy does his thing. My point is that I'm very annoyed that I had to wait so long. I hadn't activated any of those new augs because I didn't want my guy to get hurt or to faint at the worst time or something.  (I actually don't know what the consequences are from keeping it activated befor the guy fixes you)  As a result though, I had hardly any chance to put any points in those new augs. They were essentially useless to me.  More of this review to come later.",

If Square enix should have had the integrity enough to postpone the release, it would have been more honest and would probably have earned them alot of good will in the long run. Atleast they could have had the decency to aknowledge that the product was not ready for shiping and stated such.  So what is so wrong with it? The graphic bugs are endless, objects are suspended in mid-air all across the maps, you more often then not end up looking straight through walls, floors and roofs and worst of all is a throwback to the nineties when every other game came with a 'no_clip' cheat that enabled you to walk through walls. Great when you just want to rush through a boring shoot 'em up in a time before mouse+wasd, not so great when it's unexpected in a modern, immersive game with a great linage.  With that said I would like to stress that the mechanics and controlls seem solid and as always the story does suck you in straight away, so it's not a bad game.

Yes it's scum but you can ignore it. The review section is to reviews how the game plays, how it runs and if it's fun, not optional features. However, this is my opinion and I encourage you too think for yourself and make informed decisions! :)  Honestly, I'm not a person too review games in much of any way because when I do, I am very cynical.  However, I personally have found Deus Ex: Mankind Divided to be generally quite pleasing. (Also note, I didn't follow any hype and just bought it because new game that looked good so all content is a pleasant surprise to me.)  The game as far as I've played it, is interesting though. I personally find that it looks nice, it runs well even though I've got it at basically ultra maxed everything, it's fun, ya know? Nice combat, Nice abilities, great levels with depth, great characters and all around just pleasant to play. To me this game is just like HR but more updated. On a side note though, it can be a little finicky in menus where it wont register a keystroke and wont close things properly, a few issues with random stutters but it's been rare on my end.  The stealth and non-lethal runs are what I prefer and I'm also a super heavy explorer type and it makes all of that interesting and inticing to do. I've spent probably 5 hours just literally walking around climbing and trying to get places, I mean I only just saved the doctor guy.  It's a little easy even on the hardest difficulty but again, sneaky runs are kind of easier than gun runs. In some aspects, not all.  I bought the deluxe season pass and yes as you may have heard, which I am very dissapointed and feel scammed, that the DLC and content is a single playthrough use. Literal cancer to single player games topped off with a nice hefty dosage of ingame store to make sure you want to cut them wrists open.  (Personally, I wont use the items -which you find in your inventory under 'storage'- because I'd rather know I have them and possibly save them for (a) future save(s) if they make it multiple uses due to customer complaints)  It's a dirty tactic to sell and I think if they dont remove it and make it proper content not scum bag one time usage, a lot of people will not bother too buy and will refund and make the game flop, which is deserved of the publishers but the developers I feel bad for.  Other than scum bag publishers and a very idiotic store, I can't really fault the game at this point in time. Optional scum bag tactics were added that you dont have to use, which I personally never will. It doesn't ruin this game, it ruins the industry and tarnishes the devolopers name.  I'd give it an 7/10, Fun to play, Lots of things to do, a few minor bugs that'll likely be fixed quickly.",

There arent microtransactions. There is a tiny button 'Shop' that allows you to buy DLC. It doesnt force you, it doesnt shove propaganda like Sniper elite. Its just there. People make so much fuss about nothing, really.  Review  I will do a 2 part review: tech and game.  From a tecnical view, the game is pretty solid. I did get only a CTD, quite bug free. Played it on I7 4790K, 16gb, gtx 1080, 1440p. Everything turned on, except MSAA and the most absurd level of volumetric light (that doesnt make much difference), the game always stays +60fps. It have some minor loading times, but from a tech perspective the game is very solid, and the graphics are really good.   Gameplay Gameplay is more or less same as Human revolution. One thing is that you have a lot less fighting levels on this one. The interface and menus are pretty much the same.  The bad part about gameplay is that it feels like half a game. You basically just stays on praha, Human Revolution is much more bigger, longer and more satisfying. I mean, the game is good, but it feels like meh because it ends too soon.  Story Okay from the story point, not giving any spoilers, its a bit inconclusive, probably laying foundation for another or DLC. I feel the game is really shorter than it should be, the story is much more massive on Human Revolution, and i find it somewhat lacking on this one, but you get a great setting, some great characters and some interesting quests.   I would love to give it 10/10, for me its like 8 because i find the game too short. If it had the depth and size of Human Revolution easily it could be game of the year.",

The atmosphere of the game is fantastic, if you loved Human Revolution with its unique styles and influences based off of a gritty cyber-punk/Bladerunner-esque universe you should love the level designs. Prague, albeit small in the grand scheme of things, is fantastically detailed and there is a lot to keep you occupied in terms of quests. The characters and story are all A+, and in all honesty, my biggest disappointment is that the game felt short. This is probably because I've been waiting 5 years for a sequel. Enjoy it and savor it.  My biggest gripe is Square Enix' implimentation of Microtransactions in the main game. These are accessible via the 'escape' menu and are pretty much paid cheat codes: ie, pay to purchase praxis kits, etc. I beat the game without even needing them, so you can easily ignore them.  However, there are a few game breaking bugs that are slowly being patched out. The explosion at the train station, the metro tunnel at m14, all caused issues for me and I had to wait for a patch before continuing to play. Other than that, I look forward to more Deus Ex in the future.  I asked for this.",

The only thing I stress is that you know what this game is before you buy it.  Above everything, it's a stealth game. The gun mechanics have a lot of polish, but the game puts a lot more focus on stealth mechanics and suit upgrades. I went into this game expecting something like a first person shooter, but it is a completely different kind of game.  My only gripes with this game so far are pretty personal and my not reflect what everyone thinks. Firstly, I had to invest my attention to find the story interesting. While the character models and graphics are amazing (spolier: you might lag), cutscenes and dialogue are so poorly done. The facial and body expressions of the characters rarely match the tone of voice and emotions the voice actors use. It's awful, and it takes me out of the story. I guess on a positive note, I won't be dissapointed by the ending, as I've heard it's pretty bad.  Secondly, I'm kind of sick of the whole dystopian theme we've seen in a lot of games. Entertainment in general grabs this as an easy narrative, and I feel like very few games movies, books etc. get it right. Half life 2 would be an example of how to do it right.  Speaking of half life 2, this game takes so much of it's design from the half life universe. Prague in general looks like a rehash of city 17, and there are little robots that fly around and scan you literally just like the city scanners from half life 2. I can go on and on about how many other things this game copies. They say imitation is the most sincere form of admiration, and I agree with that, but I can't help but feel the creative direction this game took is a little unoriginal. But that doesn't mean this game has it's own personal aesthetic.  Other than that though, I've had so many fun moments in this game. It would take a while to explain the situations you find yourself in, but let's just say this game makes you feel like a complete ♥♥♥♥ing ninja. And for that, in spite of all the things they get wrong, I have to reccomend it.",

Many of the bugs have been fixed with patches, and while I personally don't agree with it and feel as though it's a bad addition, the microtransactions are just there to assist you when you're in a bind. However, I've heard that the microtransactions you purchase only sticks with you through one game playthrough, which adds insult to injury in some manner, but if you play through the game, explore all possibilities at obtaining XP, and are smart with your praxis purchases, you'll never need to buy any.   After playing it for 52 hours as of this moment, and after all of the patches, I can honestly say so far that this game is around an 8/10. The microtransactions does hinder the overall score, along with it's horrible first day launch, but everything else is perfect to me.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to start by addressing the obvious complaint. Yes, there are microtransactions in this title. The nature of these transactions allow you to buy in-game currency or praxis kits to unlock upgrades more quickly. That said, absolutely NONE of this is required to progress in the game or to unlock full content. All of the augmentations, weaponry, upgrades, and story are completely unattached to any pay wall. You can play the entirety of the game without ever needing to purchase a single thing using real world money. It just exists as an optional feature for lazy players who don't want to unlock their upgrades with exp. Is it cheap and money grubbing? Absolutely. Does it negatively impact the game itself? Not really. Can you go the full game without once opening the microtransaction screen? Absolutely. If you, like me, do not like microtransactions then do exactly as I did. Don't use them.  With that out of the way the game itself is an absolute delight. In terms of gameplay and mechanics it is a mirror of the gameplay found in Human Revolution, so those that are familiar with the previous title will be able to jump in effortlessly. The new augmentations are all interesting and fun to experiment with and, while initially unavailable until a side quests, you are free to unlock the full collection of them to pick your favorites. I also enjoyed the ability to switch easily from ammo types and weapon mods on the fly.   In terms of story and setting everything feels much more dense than what we had in Human Revolution. The conspiracies feel more tightly tied together and carry a heavier weight to the game world as a whole. You are also forced to make heavier choices this time around, where one option closes off the other entirely, really selling that there is no true 'Win' for everyone in the game. I felt more vulnerable and distrustful, as a character, in this game than I did in Human Revolution and that's something I enjoy greatly in a conspiracy setting.  As far as flaws for the game, my biggest complaint has to be the loading times between hub areas. Two to three minute load times for switching between city sectors, something you often have to do back and forth for the various side quests, puts a real damper on enjoyment. This isn't a dealbreaker by any measure, but is certainly something that needs improvement.   Over all I greatly enjoyed Mankind Divided and look forward to the upcoming story DLC that has been announced.",

To the actual GAME: It has a very well made atmosphere that actually does grip you and pull you in, there are some odd performance issues but it never crashed on me (maybe luck) and the few issues there are didn't bother me personally while playing, on my specs with a 970 I was around 80 fps constantly.  Positives: True to the core gameplay, stealth and routes are very nicely laid and planned out, augs provide significant improvements to your chosen gameplay style, as they should. The story is very engaging and I especially liked the side quests, many of which start as random diaries lying around in the city.  Overall the story is well written, dialogue well executed and there just isn't much to scoff at in regards to the story that the game presents, even the side quests. Solid AI (for the most part).  Negatives: As with most games in recent memory, massive sequel bait ending, especially the second ending cutscene with possible hints to a complete 180 in the percieved story.  Performance issues for some people, I know about people that can't get the game to even run above 30fps. Sometimes the AI will act a bit random and seemingly get suspicious of your body odour 50m away.  A few of the augs feel completely redundant, especially the two nonlethal ones that I don't get the point of having (game gives you plenty of ammo for your nonlethal weaponry). The social enhancer is OP yet again as it was in HR, makes too many critical things trivial.   Bottom line: 8.5/10 An excellent game, not perfect, not the be-all end-all but a valid sequel to HR and the franchise as a whole. In my opinion.  If you are a big fan of the franchise buy now, if not wait 'till it goes on sale but a deffinite must play for any cyberpunk fan.  I put in around 20 hours and I consider myself a very quick player, this is with all the sidequests and whole main quest line (a friend of mine is 16 hours in with maybe 20% completion but he is literally exploring every inch of the city).

A lot of the appeal of Deus Ex is the economic, political, and conspiracy theory ridden dialog in the game. It makes the game world intriguing, it makes the game world interesting. You want to live in that world even though it's on the edge of economic collapse. Mankind Divided has none of that. The writing is not as interesting. The whole game is forgettable. It took me 30+ hours to complete this game, and I never really understood that much of what was going on, or why it even mattered. It’s not even that it was confusing, I just didn’t care, the game didn't give me a reason to care.  My next complaint is (and this is kind of the spoiler) that the only hub in the game is Prague. Deus Ex had New York City, Paris, Hong Kong, and other smaller locations, and for the most part it was all interesting. I will never forget the Chateau DuClare. Invisible War had Seattle, Cairo, and Trier, and though that game is widely critisized I kind of liked it and have fond memories of Upper and Lower Seattle and especially returning to the ruins of Liberty Island. Human Revolution had Detroit and Shanghai. Mankind Divided is just Prague. Prague isn’t very interesting either. About 20 hours in I was sick of Prague and kept expecting to move on to another hub, and I felt the lack the whole time. Really what Deus Ex needs is to go back to New York City. I showed my dad New York City in Deus Ex and he was blown away since he’s from there. He was amazed at the realistic layout of the subway stations. I've personally been to Battery Park and Liberty Island, and that made that game all the more real. Prague is just some place I’ve heard of, nothing about it felt real even with modern graphics.   The other thing that bothered me is that there really is no reference to the first Deus Ex. Yeah, sure, they threw in some characters from the original game, it was cool to see Lucius DeBeers not on life support, but this game takes place in a time when a lot of the events mentioned in the first game happened, but they don't do anything with that. When I first saw DeBeers and Everett I thought there was going to be a lot more preamble to the conspiracies from the first game. There wasn’t. It was a nod, nothing more.  I now want to take a moment to bash all the reviewers that criticize the game for stupid reasons... Apparently there are micro-transactions... I never looked at them and never used them. This game certainly isn't 'Pay to Win' as at least one reviewer wrote, there is plenty of loot in the game. You could easily end the game with 60,000 credits. The game by itself offers you everything you need. More than enough. I played on Give Me Deus Ex difficulty, and had no trouble with what was available. Yeah, it was kind of bad form on the publisher/developer to have micro-transactions in a $60 single player game, but really it didn’t ruin the game. The $60 I spent on the game was $60 of fun.",

I played through the main game exploring a ton and doing all side quests and main quests and i played the jensen story desperate measures. my playtime is sitting on 50 hours which is a pretty nice number. but again i did a ton of exploring, meaning every nook and cranny which took some time.  now would i recommend this game? Hell yes at this full price? maybe? yes would i recommend the season pass? ehh.... highly depends on how good the dlcs are  would i recommend putting any more money into the game with their microtransactions  hell ♥♥♥♥ing no.   the game is great no question about that. theres people complaining about performance which is justified but 1. this is a highly demanding game don't underestimate that like most 2. turn of ♥♥♥♥ msaa 3. other issues get worked on pretty fast  other complaints i saw were microtransactions. which i agree are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t  BUT you can ignore them completelly. theres no big popups telling you to pay money hell i didn't even know there were microtransactions till i delved into the dicussions and saw people whining about it if you really want your extra praxis points early in the game use cheatengine simple.   and for the story ending being a bit incomplete? it felt pretty complete to me for a single game. it's like watching a trilogy and only the first part ending (or i guess second in this case :P) so we can expect that story to be expanded with either a sequel or the dlcs (i'm hoping sequel for bigger budget meaning likely a bigger game)  now the biggest turn of for me and probably many others.  the ♥♥♥♥ing extras you get from pre ordering or dlc and ♥♥♥♥. (with the exceptions of a couple items) are 1 time bloody use only. use it once in a savegame. and any other save game wont be able to get it.  new playthrough? want that extra stuff? TO ♥♥♥♥ING BAD if you used it in your last playthrough. it's the bigest pile of horsecrap they could do. on that reason alone i almost wanted to not recomend this game. luckily the rest of the game is pretty solid and fun.  so yeah pros: +good story +decent length +beautiful graphics +pretty awesome new augments +more of that deus ex hr i loved +from what i played in the breach its pretty decent  cons: -some performance issues atm -♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t one time use items from pre orders and dlc's ",

Also the DLCS are kinda weak and I don't think it was worth what I paid for the season pass.. so far. However DXMD made me play +80hrs in the glorious 1440P 3D vision at everything maxed out and it was impressive... little things like stopping suddenly to see the a hatch's texture.. yeah the textures were impressive. The story while sadly not revealing more about the Illuminati Cult it did give hints to the New World Order and corporate corruptions that relate to real life.  This game is worth every penny imo, and I cannot wait for future releases of Deus Ex. Well done devs of Square Enix on a masterpiece worth replayability and mouth dropping graphics with a solid story. Oh and thank you for 3D vision support, it was impressive seeing your masterpiece in 3D. I give this game 8/10! It would be 9/10 if performance and story ending were improved. Thank you!",

I hope the game maker will release an update that makes sure everyone who has audible dialog is in the subtitles. Otherwise, you annoy your deaf and hard-of-hearing customers, and you get reviews like this one.   Also, the subtitles need a background. Ideally, you need to provide color and background options, but at least go with a default light text on a dark background. The background can even be translucent.   The text of people on the other end of comms is great, but if all subtitles could be placed in the same location, that would keep the player from having to bounce eyes between two widely spaced screen areas.

            "review_text": "Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is almost everything I wanted in a sequel to Human Revolution. The graphics aren't earth-shattering, but are gorgeous in their own right. Aside from a few stutters here and there, I was able to run the game at 1080p 60fps with the recommended specs. The gameplay has been polished to a beautiful sheen, with multiple violent and nonviolent, stealthy and obvious paths through every mission. There is only one boss in the game, but there are multiple ways to deal with him this time around, a great relief from the horrendous bosses of Human Revolution.  The choices you make matter one way or another, and the environment and NPCs react dynamically as a result. The main hub of Prague is jaw-droppingly detailed, with a seemingly endless supply of nooks and crannies for you to explore and dig through. While the main story missions aren't a marked improvement from Human Revolution's, the side mission really shine as some of the most creative and intriguing ones in the series. All of the old augmentations are back, along with a few new ones that are completely over-the-top and gratuitous. The voice acting is hit and miss with the side-characters, but Adam Jensen takes the spotlight once again, with a slightly more affected tone adding a lot more depth to his character.  The only area the game disappoints in is with the story as a whole. Out of all the Deus Ex games, this is easily the weakest story that covers the least amount of ground. Nothing really gets accomplished, and the story just abruptly ends without really resolving any of the overarching goals and problems set forth. Also, instead of finding a way to encorporate your ending choice in Human Revolution, the game just kind of ignores the idea that there was a choice to begin with and never really mentions it again. It does this by taking place 2 years after Human Revolution's ending, which is a true shame considering how much important events happen in that time.  And yes, the microtransactions are the biggest load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you can possibly imagine. There was never once pressure to buy anything though, and supplies and Praxis come at a steady enough stream that I never felt the need to buy more.  Avoid the multiplayer at all costs.  9/10, truly a fantastic game despite its numerous shortcomings.",

Gameplay: Significantly better mechanics than HR  Positives: -Switching cover mecahnic is nice -Weapon customization is super cool (although I wish a silencer could go on the sniper rifle -Addition of Scrap Metal to upgrade Weapons (reload time, damage, etc.) -The addition of Multi tool (hack anything with this one-use item) -AMMO IS NOT SCARCE ANYMORE!!! Unlike it's predecesor, this game has significantly more ammo, hacking software, grenades, etc. and it is awesome. No more sparing use! Also, you get Paxis Kits like every mission so you get to experience the games mecahnics sooner rather than later. -New Augs are super useful and epic (remote hacking, titan armor)  Negatives: -Gameplay takes a while to get used to -Some bug with hacking remotely (with the new aug) causing the cameras to see you even while behind cover -Body dragging is derpy -(A little thing) character conversations have pauses in between taking turns and it sort of funny/awkard -Only ONE boss fight at the very end so...ok (I recommend saving all your bio cells and health stims for this fight and using the augs: TITAN ARMOR, and TYPHOON.

Terrorist bomb, blah blah blah who cares, here's some 30 minute CSI cop show conversations to skip though.... The story has NOTHING to do with human revolution, and not one single choice you make in revolution, has any effect in mankind divided. Example. In human revolution you're given three choices at the end. Each of these three choices should set the world on a totaly different course. Now in mankind divided, the developers picked the worst absolute WORST ending choice from revolution, and force it on you through divided.   Almost the entire game is set in Prague, exactly like every single game like this I've ever seen. Prague has to be the single most over used worn out and boring video game setting EVER.   The graphics are way over done. Meaning, it's super gorgeous but it doesn't need to be. There's really no special effects, or epic battles to look at. You just spend the whole game talking to people about terrorists, or crawling through vents. You also spend a lot of time introducing yourself as interpol, and then explaining that you're not the police, even though 'interpol' means International Police. There's a lot of little details in this game that don't fit with continuity even from scene to scene. About the graphics, if you have a good graphics card it will run great, but don't expect to just turn the settings down and run it on a walmart laptop because it's not going to work. You do have to have at least a decent computer for this one.   GAMEPLAY is actually a lot of fun. Game play itself is very much like revolution, but the AI seems a lot more aware alert and intelligent than in the previous games. In gun fights you have to watch out for the AI is constantly attempting to flank you.   Personal Gripe: I HATE Pritchard, and THATS who they bring back for a DLC? What about Malak?  Final thought. Eh... It's another investigative police game, but I do recomend it, because the actual game play is pretty fun, with lots of different ways to complete a mission.

Smart Vision is a lot more useful now, give more detail and insight about your surroundings.   Enemy AI feel a bit smarter but also a lot harsher compared to HR, they react differently to thrown objects and the pathing is a lot more mapped out so far. Combat is pretty much the same, you might get a bit confused because they switched things up a bit regarding your hp and energy level. ( still the same underlying mechanic if Im understanding it correctly )   Graphics are astounishing, games looks very good on high settings, I personally disabled features like advanced shadows and put shadows on medium, no blur or Depth blur for me. I understand that you get a large performance hit if you use some of the more advanced options like tessellation, advanced lightning options and contact hardend shadow. Might have to wait for AMD or Nvidea to get some driver specific patches!

Control: These are solid but I do have some complaints. They changed how cover works. In the last game you could stake out a situation and move around keeping an eye on the bad guys. They changed it so now you have to look at the area you are moving to making you take your eyes of the baddies. This has lead to more than one instance of me running out of cover because in a lot of ways it still feels like DXHR. They also changed certain things and you are stuck with them. In DXHR you would right click for cover and middle mouse for iron sights. You can edit your controls but it won't let you change the middle mouse click from an Aug activation. Meaning you cannot set up the control for more of the stealth only gameplay I like so much. All in all, having to learn a new control scheme is not ruining my fun in the game.   My one complaint here is the fidgety ledge grab system. I sometimes struggle to get Jensen to do what I need him to do. Sometimes he grabs a ledge and sometimes he doesn't. This comes with the fidgety jump enhancement. You hold the space bar to get him to jump higher, which means he will sometimes unintentionally grab a ledge. They actually fixed my initial double jump feel complaint. Now when you hold the jump you are just sent on a steady upward climb to the apex of your jump.  Gameplay: This is mostly the same as the last. Each area has a plethora of ways to access it. I sometime go into a situation the hard way and have a much more poor outcome only to find I missed a much better way of approach if only I had been paying more attention. You can also still approach the game multiple ways. Stealth is always an option, but you can also go in guns blazing. You are still offered a nice expansive aug tree to pick how you want to play. You play stealth and switch to guns blazing, bad idea. You are very squishy so just deciding you are going to start shooting everyone is a bad idea. But the right augs will turn you into a terminator, which is the way I imagine people want a game like this to be, a character that is highly customizable. Hacking is the same but a bit more attractive interface. Hard at first, but no matter how you spin it, at level 4 and 5, it's hard. They had a very good use of the same hub area at different times. They felt very different and new because you had different obstacles in your way at different times, it made the world feel very good.  Story: I don't feel like it just ended when it was just getting going, I have seen this criticism many times. The game feels complete with me, there are 2 boss encounters in the game, one of which is an optional sidequest. These are open, you are free to do them how you want, I was able to do both in a non-lethal fashion. It was very fun. I think it's a bit of a writing faux pas that they ended it like they did. If they had simply avoided the opening cinematic with the Illuminati speaking, they wouldn't have run into a problem since you don't see them for the rest of the game. I feel they simply gave the player too much data at the beginning and then they don't address it except in a few conversations. It's a writing error to give the player more data than the character you play as has in the game. It tends to feel very frustrating as a player/viewer/reader. They could have even kept the mid end credits scene and it would have been fine because that is an appropriate time to let the player know more is happening.   Bugs: At the time of this review most of the bugs had been fixed. The only one I ran into now is a strange waypoint situation where sometimes the waypoint doesn't update. I only just discovered this in the last area of the game (which I beat last night). I think it's the result of an update though, because I do think I experienced it once just prior to that. Nothing major, you just keep going and it will update, but it can get a bit confusing in reference to more open areas.  Overall: This game is still very good. I enjoy it thoroughly for what it is. I have some complaints about the UI, such as the new energy level display mechanic is better looking but not nearly as telling as the last one. I definitely have to suggest this game at this point if you like the previous game as much as a lot of people did. I have seen some complaints about the Microtransactions, but it's the same as what EA did with Deadspace. Optional if you wanted it, not at all necessary. The load times were a bit ridiculous at first, but they are loading an entire area of prague with all it's hidden corridors, people and events. Once you load into a section or prague there is no loading what so ever. Load times also change depending on the size of the area you are going to. Smaller areas load pretty quick, as do save loads into the same area you are already in. But it really is long when switching areas. They fill this with kind of neat world flavor with some videos that play as Jensen rides the train with other people, or walks through subway tunnels when the train is shut down. Total playtime at the time of this was 29 legitimate play hours.",

If there ever comes a time where you're tempted to buy something from the microtransaction store, just use cheat engine instead. Don't give a single penny to the shady practices Square Enix is trying to pull.  However, the gameplay and story is solid. It's really just more of what you got from Human Revolution, and is definitely worth playing for that reason.  So I'd have to say wait til the game drops in price and/or goes on sale, but do give it a try once it does, because behind all the bs, a good game still exists here.",

            "review_text": "Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is the sequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution which was released a few years ago. It is set in a future where humans can be 'augmented' to restore limbs and recieve upgrades that can be weapons or other abilities. Throughout the game these 'augmented' people are referred to as 'augs'. The game is heavily focused on an in depth story which changes depending on the choices the player makes. The game offers a variety of ways to complete missions and objectives which can range from a complete rambo attack play style destroying everything they see to a highly stealthy play style where you are not even seen or heard by one enemy NPC. Your route varies as well as you can crawl through a vent, hack a few door security panels or break through a wall to reach another area.  Your abilities are managed via the augment tree where you can choose abilities for offense, defense, perception, athletic ability and electronic manipulation (hacking). There are many abilities to choose from to suit your preffered play style and have various upgrades to increase their effectiveness or decrease their energy consumption. Initially you have many of these abilities but you will lose them early on, giving you the opportunity to rebuild yourself to your own preffered way.  The game navigates the story well and always provides detailed background behind situations and engaging dialogue. Voice acting is top notch and so are the choices for steering conversations with NPCs. The game tries to steer you on to the main story missions occasionally but you are free to roam the city of Prague and discover all the little secrets and extras that the game has to offer. The game also feels very polished and smooth which shows that a lot of testing was conducted prior to release which sadly does not happen a lot these days as most studios are looking to deliver a product as fast as possible and/or meet a release date. This is also evident as the release date for Mankind Divided was pushed back a few months to fix some problems and smooth some bugs and the finished product was worth the wait. I had no issues with the game and even tried the beta version that supports Direct X 12 too.  I write this review after I have finished the game for a third time on the hardest difficulty where you only have one life for your entire playthrough. Overall the game is of excellent quality, has a great skill tree, has an engaging story and a good combat and stealth system. You do need to enjoy these types of games to get the most out of it and taking a stealth approach is in my opinion, the best way to experience the game.  Highly recommended 10/10.",

I wish to separate the review of the physical, final product from the DLC/Store content which, IMO, is optional and not required in any way whatsoever. Yes, the model is shady and deplorable behavior by Square Enix, however, the actual game itself is a very good and enjoyable experience.   If you love the franchise but are hesitant about the DLC model, purchase the game and avoid the store entirely.

In the last game the augmented went nuts and started killing people, but that wasn't their fault.

It also doesn't consider augmented individuals who might try to hide their augmentations. The augmented here are down trodden victims who need to be cared for by corporations, governments and aid groups, rather than capable individuals. I found the stance that the naturals take in fearing augmented individuals and considering them all to be bad, to be horrifically over simplified.  Other than the story, this was an ok squeal. The hub areas are nice to explore and like the previous game there is some really nice architecture. The big new addition is a few new augmented powers that Jenson gets, their appearance is never properly explained despite Jenson doing a few small quests to discover their origin as this has been left open to another sequel. The ending leaves a lot to be desired. 3/5",

I didn't even know they had them to be quite honest. Beat the game and spent 24 hours on it, not once did I see anything mentioning microtransactions. Not once did I feel the need for them. In fact, if anything this game could stand to be a little bit more difficult. I maxed out everything I wanted to about half way to 3/4 the way through the campaign. I can't imagine what people would want to buy. But hey, if some guy wants to throw more money at the game, let him. This game is amazing and I want more of it.  2. PC performance. Now I have a 1070, so I may not represent everyone, but I ran through this entire game, everything on Ultra (no MSAA, Hard Contact Shadows ON) without ever dropping below 70fps. This is not a bad port. These guys gave us really high end graphics options, and it seems people cried because their 1080gtx couldn't max it at 4k. That's silly. Overreactions galore here.  3. The rushed ending. Well, I can see why people would say this. But really, my main complaint here is that the game is so damn good I didn't want it to end. It still gives you 20-25 hours of gameplay EASILY on ONE playthough. You could rush it down to less time, but then if you are speedrunning why is game length a concern of yours. There is a full game here no question. And it's a very good game at that.  Now that that is out of the way. This game is amazing, it rocks, go buy it. Best stealth game I've played.",

Is it the way everything is written and makes you want to barf? Is it the way the game keeps fading to black after pretty much all interactions? Is it the way the characters are reacting so slowly in a conversation? Is it the gun fight system? Is it the cover system?  Yes and no...  I really couldn't tell what's bothering me... There is something but I don't know...  The background and text to read are seriously unreadable unless you are a fanatic, worse, they're not that optional because you need to read a lot of information to go from quest to quest or understand the story. I'm going to compare the game to an elder scrolls where there is a lot of books, lore and such but they're totally optional and you can make the entire game and not open a single book if you don't like it... But they're really well written and makes you want to read most of the time. In Deus Ex, the game wants to force you to read because you hack computers, get those personal journal device, the news paper, emails, ... Well, there's a lot to read with a lot of background, stories and such but the way everything is written is impossible to digest and makes you want to skip half way through it because it's all so boring!  I have for a proof, the game begins just that way, they tell you the story of the first game in way so horrible you want to fall asleep after 15seconds of listening to it.  In such game, when reading is important, I want to have something really well written to entertain me and making me want to read more... Here, it's just no! You almost want to beg the game to stop throwing text at you. Then finding more text to read is just frustrating and this makes you skip on the storyline! The choice of writers is just awful !!!  The mechanics of the conversation with the stress meter is still obscure to me to say the least! The lack of information about what does what is just incredible.  The piracy mini-game is a pain, it doesn't make much sense or make the game more enjoyable and I thought they learned their lessons in Human Revolution but they didn't.  Finally, for somebody who does a lot of Coop, I would have loved to see a coop mode! But nothing there...  -Now, the game has a lot of positive as well and this is why I would recommend it: First, graphically, the game is impressive! Lots of options to modify graphics as well.  The world is coherent, the story is logical as well.  Architecture is just amazingly good.  The choice of design, of colors or the clothing of the characters is really impressive.  Lots of npc you can't interract with in the game but the principal ones are really colorful and have their personalities and attitudes.  The level design... Two thumbs up for the impressive level design full of other way around. You can get to a place from so many different angles, so many ways around... The level design is even better than in the first game and a lot of research and work was done there.  Lots of interaction with the environment as well.  Fighting is pleasant most the time, guns are cool, modifications too. Lots of different way to fight be it with the different guns available, hand to hand or with the environment, stealthy or not.  The RPG mechanics, menus, maps, crafting (so simple it was a great idea), ... all is done very carefully, lots of options, a bit confusing to keep track of all the pda we get but it's mostly clear and neat.  The idea of 'advanced power', not going to spoil but they're pretty bad ♥♥♥! You can really go different routes and adapt your play style.  Well, it's hard to go wrong actually with Deus Ex, the game is really well done and it's default are quickly forgotten. I don't care for the DLC and the breach game so much as I didn't like the art style but it's there, it doesn't hold any value at all but it's there if you want to make some scoring.  For a lesser price, go for it if you like this kind of game but you'll probably have to force yourself a bit to like the game.",

            "review_text": "Here's what I think.  Time: For US $60, this game is a little short (but only a little). My playthrough (blind, 2 years after I last played H.R.) came to last roughly 20 hours. This includes the main story, and roughly 7 side missions, of which there are like 12 or so. NOTE: MILEAGE MAY VARY  Story: The plot of Mankind Divided was intriguing but the game ends on a major cliffhanger, so don't expect any conclusion at the end of all this. The beginning is also confusing as hell, since you are given no real information prior to being thrown out of an aircraft.  Gwafiks: The game looks great, but seems to be tanking on many machines, so unless you have 8 1080's in your rig, dont expect to be running on Ultra Max++.   Gameplay: Its basically Human Revolution with an even longer detection meter, some more skills and new maps. Nothing new here, but that may not be a bad thing. Though the AI is even worse than ususal.  Moneyz$$$: On the subject of microtransactions, they are a load of bull, but I don't care since you will never need them. I never ended up using my preorder bonus because they just give you a tranquilizer rifle with no projectile trajectory degradation and a one hit headshot snooze for most enemies.  Bugs: Yes gwafiks are buggy, but I managed to play through the game and only crash once.  Replayability: The problem with replayability is that I basically already have. If you've already played Human Revolution, then playing this game again will probably just feel like playing through a second DLC for HR, rather than a new game. Doesn't mean I wont, it'll just take longer to regain interest.   TLDR: Game is the same, graphics are messy but good, plot is confusing at first and then leaves on a cliffhanger, microtransactions are stil dumb, and TITAN users can die in a fire.  0/10 No Malik waifu, new pilot is racist and depressed bad gaem.  Get it on sale, or now if you are an addict to gravely voices and slavs.",

It's a DLC-length full title. I think I got more enjoyment and intrigue from the sidequests (which were few, but fun and surprisingly well fleshed-out) than the main storyline. Not to spoil anything, but the end boss in this game feels like a grunt. There's no satisfying build-up or payoff. The game ends where it feels like it should have been the end of the first chapter.  It's pretty, there's more stuff, combat is better, the new augments are fun (although some so powerful as to be essentially broken)... the main issue and why it's getting so many negative reviews is the fact that the story is so underwhelming that it leaves you feeling cheated at the end for paying full price.  I don't know whether it's because the game was rushed, or they want to see how little story they can get away with putting into a full price game without affecting preorders or sales too badly. It feels like a lot of love went into making this game, but it feels cut short, and you come away feeling cheated.

            "review_text": "=============== 2016-10-08 UPDATE ===============  Okay, so the major issues with DXMD have been resolved, and I've been able to play through the game from start to finish. I'm glad to be able to say that it was an exceptionally fun and engrossing ride, and I'm already starting in on my New Game+.   The story (which is what I've always loved about the Deus Ex series) is of the standard we expect, with plot holes being relatively few and minor. The branching design of the story is cleverly done, with some of the consequences of your actions not becoming apparent until much, much later in the game. In a lot of ways, the story is the most impressive part of DXMD - but that's not to say the rest of it is mediocre, just that the story is in my opinion very, very well done.  Voice acting and dialogue is, as usual, two good cuts above the average. The score is exceptional, and really sets the mood.   Graphically, it's a typical example of a made-for-console title, although it sure is a lot prettier and more responsive after the numerous patches it's had since release. It should be noted that, for all the flak I and many others gave the devs, they have been working tirelessly to address the issues. (the steam beta channel is up to 1.7 last time I checked!)  Regarding the pay-to-win debacle (that is, being able to buy praxis kits - skill points, for those who don't know the mechanic): just don't use the store. Yes, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing to implement, but game dev is a buisness like any other. I'm willing to bet that partticular design choice was made by a senior executive and not the guys at the coal face.    TLDR   Fun and engrossing sci-fi fps/rpg/adventure, with obviously high production values. The whole experience really does feel very blade-runner-esque, and the amount of content in the base (i.e. no DLC) experience was a solid 40 hours on the medium difficulty, and that's with the huge in-game boosts I got for pre-ordering.  =============== 2016-08-28 UPDATE ===============  Have now completely deleted game and re-downloaded the entire 19gb. Re-tried each release (vanilla, beta 1, beta 2) and setting every option to 'low' or equivalent. I still cannot get past the vendor splash screen. As releases go, this is the biggest steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ I've ever seen. It beggars belief. Don't touch this with a ten foot pole; go buy the console version instead if you have that option.  =============== 2016-08-26 UPDATE ===============  Second beta patch, and DXMD still crashes at the AMD splash screen. Aside from the 1.5 hours where it ran fine the first launch, I have not been able to play this game at all.    Do not, under any circumstances, buy this game. Yet.    EDIT: Don't even consider buying this title. It makes the last AC debacle look good. To sum this garbage up in a single image:  it looks like this  [i.imgur.com]     Don't take my word for it, go check out the discussion page with hundreds (and rapidly climbing) comments detailing performance issues, bugs and crashes.  I'm one of the lucky ones who, after getting to play for just over an hour, am now suffering a CTD after ~1-2 seconds of the AMD logo splash.  I have tried every single permutation of fixes/work-arounds (one of the more adorable ones is to create a whole new user account for the game), but cannot for the life of me get it to work.  The good news is, the hour and a bit I *did* get to play was pretty fun. So much fun that I cancelled my refund request, because I really, really want to play this title. Just don't waste your money/sanity by purchasing it until they fix it. ",

I'd argue this game is better than HR...but I will get to that.  1 and 5 are basically the same problem...ish. That was a cliffhanger, definitly, for some 'Mankind Divided 2'. It can be argued that it is half a game...but this half a game is MASSIVE. there's more in this half a game than I've seen almost anywhere else in my experience.  Why is the performance the same problem as a cliffhanger ending...? because I think history will be kind to this game. In the future, when we all have shiny GTX 1380s and get the second half of this game, we will have in our hands what, combined, will be likely one of the best 'single' games ever made. It's clear that Eidos Montreal is thinking way far ahead...but instead of a good launch, they wanted longevity. They wanted Mankind Divided to have the staying power that the original Deus Ex did. And in the far future when a world where both halves exist, one we KNOW is coming...they will succeed.

Maybe a loud playthrough would have more fun with the augs, but that really just adds one aug to the progression as I still don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about the nanoblade enhancement.  I feel like the game is missing at least two thirds of its content, I mean come on we don't even get another hub city, that's a huge staple of the ♥♥♥♥ing Deus Ex series completely ♥♥♥♥ing omitted for no good reason whatsoever. I thought London would be the new hub city, but NOOOOOOOOOOOO that's just the location for the ending. Which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.  People saying that they're getting crazy high playtime numbers or claiming 30~ hours is good are either full of ♥♥♥♥, awful at the game, doing a no detection run, or have never played a ♥♥♥♥ing Deus Ex game before.  I have HUNDREDS of hours on my original CD copy of Deus Ex 1 and playthroughs of that game definitely take more than this one, as specially considering most of the meat of this game is contained in side quests and if you just played the main story and nothing else the first game would have an even easier time beating it out in time.  The game is still fun, and I enjoy it a lot, I'm not ripping on the gameplay outside of the progression that feels very rushed and as if someone wrote themselves into a corner and couldn't come up with a better way out, I just feel that a huge part of the game is missing and want more. Shield  It almost feels like when they got called on the preorder ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they needed to find out another way to artificially inflate DLC sales and ♥♥♥♥ so they just quietly without telling anyone did this and cut most of the game off so they can sell it back to us later pretending that it wasn't ready at release and they began development on it after the release of the game when in reality it was ready and they just want more cash. I mean it is pretty telling that a Deus Ex game just suddenly has a season pass out of butt♥♥♥♥ nowhere, why would they even bother with a season pass if there was only going to be one DLC like HR had, there's going to be at least two, and possibly three, all containing the parts of the game that are just not here.

Side missions will keep you from the main game for hours, they are incredibly unique and immersive in their own way, sort of like the Witcher 3 side quests.

Ridiculous trolling by Nixxes and the community, refusing to even entertain the idea that they're not perfect.  MSAA off. CHS off. Volumetric lighting off.   ~edit~  Originally tried to run this game with a GTX780 and the experience was beyond terrible, I have since upgraded to a GTX1070 G1 Gaming and it's running significantly better.. but that is no excuse. You shouldn't have to buy $500 graphics cards in order to counter lousy programming and lazy optimisation. MSAA is still off, CHS is on, Volumetric Lighting is on and everything else is either High or V.High and it's locked 60 except during daytime Prague, or facing certain directions in TF29 HQ and 'another area later in the game' CPU usage is incredibly demanding in Prague, often capping out at 100%  The game still, even after several large patches, a 6 month 11th hour delay, and a prolonged development period, has some really dodgy teething issues. Random crashes, lousy CPU optimisation, control glitches and a heavily consolified UI.  ~edit~  As much as I really want to leave the review negative, to hopefully send a message to the likes of Square Enix or EM/Nixxes, I feel to do so after playing and finishing the game would be unfair. After upgrading my system in order to brute-force through lousy coding, and receiving five major updates, I was able to play the game as it was meant to be played --- and it was a hell of a ride. It took me just shy of 58 hours, though I'd say a good 5 or more of those was due to reloads and redoing areas until it was perfect ;)   The story was good, though it never really goes anywhere and ends abruptly on a hell of a cliffhanger with multiple plot points left unresolved. I'm not sure who is to blame for this, whether it's publisher meddling and splitting the story over as yet unreleased DLCs and expansions, but it's definitely disappointing. It seems like the developers spent more time on the, albeit excellent, side missions in the game.. than the base story itself, and that is a shame, meaning we either have to wait (and pay &gt;_&gt;) for expansions down the line, or wait (and wait and wait) for the threequel to come Whenever© Some nice nods to past - and future - DX titles, and you can definitely see where they're setting up subsequent storylines, it's just galling to know that we aren't getting the full story in this single game, and the half-finished 'feel' to the shockingly abrupt ending leaves a sour taste.  Audio is, as it always has been in the DX series, great. Music is excellent, ambient sound is great, voices are superb, and the overall feel of Prague is incredibly well designed with enormous exploration potential. The visuals themselves are stunning, with crisp textures, beautiful lighting, and high poly models - but sadly there's also a lot of visual issues, ambient occlusion 'halos', shadow flickering, screen space reflection flickering, just random annoyances. Nothing overly bothersome, just irritating, especially when you consider the long development time, subsequent long delay before release, and then several major updates prior to release. The visuals, even toned down to medium and lower, brought my GTX780 to its knees, but even when cranked to the highest barely had my GTX1070 in the 80% utilisation range, add that to the *incredibly* tough CPU utilisation and performance is most definitely less than ideal. DirectX 12 was one of the big selling points of the game and the engine, yet the game launched without any support for the API... and then, when it finally does launch, it's implementation is shoddy at best and downright broken at worst.  Still, for all my gripes, I don't regret playing this. I don't regret buying it. I don't regret recommending it to other people. It had a terrible launch (an unfortunate constant when Nixxes is involved) but there's also a lot of obvious love invested in the game, the attention to detail is incredible and the world just makes you WANT to explore it. As a followup to the amazing Human Revolution, it's superior in practically every way, with much more emphasis on exploration, significantly bigger levels with VERY few loading screens, and a fantastic visual lick of paint.   .... let's just hope we get more story and soon.

The mere presence of an in-game store on a single player game is an insult to the playerbase, the franchise, and just plain common decency.  In the brief time this review has been in existence I have been swarmed by comments that my reasoning is invalid. That the presence of an optional store is irrelevant to gameplay.  I ask back. Is it? Are you sure?  The original Deus Ex was a masterpiece of resource management. There was meaning in your choice of whch augments, which skills, if you used lockpicks or multitools or bullets. And in Mankind Divided you can trivialize all that effort for the low low price of whatever. $3.99 gets you 5 praxis points. There go all those hard decisions, for less than the price of lunch.  And I'm being told this isn't going to impact game design?  The game developers and producers want our money. They are putting out a product designed to entice us to give it to them. This product crosses a line. This business model is unethical. It damages the integrity of the game design, it insults the players, and it must not be condoned.  And this isn't an issue worth making a review over?",

I was hyped up for the next chapter of Deus Ex since I finished Deus Ex Human Revolution in 2011, and followed their forums, followed their channels, read everything about this universe. This game was supposed to be an eye opener, the bridge between the Adam Jensen era and JC Denton's era.  To say the truth, for the first 80% of this game I was feeling like something amazing is going to happen, some secrets are going to be revealed, new conspiracies are going to be discovered. But with the last 2 hours, the game just falls apart, it loses its direction and it stops explaining anything that is going on. After that you get a really difficult mission with many ways to explore and finish the objective, you finish it and get prepared for the next objective, and after it you just see the words 'You have unlocked NEW GAME +'. This really just broke me. I don't even want to talk about mouse acceleration and all the bugs with the metro stations that I've had had during my playthrough. It was supposed to be the game of the year, but now its the dissapointment of the year.  Thanks Square Enix for ruining one of the best franchises I've ever been interested in.",

Here's a rundown of the issues I'm having right now.  1-For some reason, it irks me to know that the pre-order DLC's are one use only. I don't really care, seeing how I probably won't be using them, but I don't like the modus operandi. Shady practices, especially when it wasn't mentioned when I pre-ordered. False advertising is a blight in gaming right now.  2-Poor optimization: Some people will tell you your computer is a toaster (mine is far from it) and that's why you're having issues. Others will tell you to turn off MSAA (as if we didn't try that) while the dumbest ones will tell you to download the latest drivers (you mean the ones that didn't come out yet for AMD GPU'S?). Anywhosies, terrible frame drops at random.  3-Crashes. So the game loves to stutter (even during cutscenes) and the best part of it all, for some people (including me) it crashes at a certain point in the game (always at the same time). People are telling us to lower the graphics, put in windowed mode and all that shebang. Honestly, I don't even want to try it as I'm still on the fence for refunding the game and playing around with the settings and listening to that 5minute exposition when you exit the train will probably put me past the 2 hour mark.  All of that to say, I don't recommend this purchase. Terrible publishing practices don't deserve money IMO. If you don't care about that and don't have the FPS dips/crashes. Go for it. If you care, don't buy it. Wait a couple of years for the 'Director's cut' for cheap.  *Ok, I figured out the stutter during cutscenes, which just further proves how badly this was ported. So as with most games, cutscenes are used as loading screens, so when the game is done loading, cutscene freezes, stutters for a bit and keeps going. That's where the stuttering is coming from, and no, I'm not putting this on my SSD, my SSD is reserved to utility, OS and security.  Also they fixed the crash at the train station, but still, the game has issues, I had it crash when I went into the options... It just went to my desktop, no error message, no 'DE:MD has stopped working', nothing, just a hard crash to desktop.*",

But no, Deus Ex - Mankind Divided happens to be the only game within the series, that offers the same protagonist as one of the previous titles. Sometime before the release I read a preview which stated that this was a pure marketing-made decision, since Adam Jensen was so popular among the fanbase. And after my first playthrough I do believe that statement.   Please don’t get me wrong - many aspects are astonishingly great: The art design is still extremely impressive and the same goes for the music. The atmosphere, consisting of scenario, characters and just the world itself, unfolds after the first steps and completely sucks one into this fascinating universe.  But Deus Ex - Mankind Divided lacks one thing that makes the storylines of Deus Ex and Deus Ex – Human Revolution so outstandingly great: Credibility.  Beware, dear reader, a mild spoiler ahead: After his first mission Adam returns to Prague and just in the moment of his arrival, someone is committing a terrorist attack at the very same railway station. The game starts on the next day and Adam is ordered to take the subway to travel to the headquarter of the organisation he is currently working at. The streets are crowded and barely anyone is even talking about the catastrophe which took place the day before right at the very next vicinity. I always thought such a thing would be the theme of all themes...  The story misses to catch the player since it slowly starts drifting away from its own essence.  And a point I strongly dislike is the cashgrab-mentality behind this new instalment: The game starts with a gap between its beginning and the end of its predecessor. You want to know the story behind Adams transfer to the TF29? Buy the book! And the microtransactions of course - in a full priced singleplayer-game. This alone could be an instant downvote.  I was pondering a long time about giving Deus Ex - Mankind Divided thumps up or down. It feels wrong to disapprove this game for what it is. As a game for itself, Deux Ex - Mankind Divided is great and would definitely deserve a thumps up - but it disappoints as a Deus Ex and as the successor of Deus Ex - Human Revolution.",

It's a worthy sequel to Deus Ex : Human Revolution, which matches, or exceeds its predecessor in almost every area (with the possible exception being the story). Gameplay is more refined, the character models look more convincing and animate better during dialogue, and there are seemingly infinite routes you can take to navigate the truly massive levels.   But I can't recommend you buy it.   I am quite aware of the issues people have with the game's built in micro-transactions, and for what it's worth, I think it's definitely a lame choice, and should never have been included. In my own experience though, these do not interfere with the gameplay and can be largely ignored.   My issue is simply that this is a bad port. Nixxes has dropped the ball. I am running a system that absolutely exceeds the 'recommended' spec (GTX 980 4gb , i7-3770K , 32 gb ram ) and yet I am facing CONSTANT crashes, video driver malfunctions, and fatal errors of every kind. yes, I have the latest drivers, yes I have made sure not to select 'ultra' texture settings ( this only works if you have an 8 GB VRAM card, apparently), but still the game is an unstable, crashy, mess. Sometimes I can go for hours without a crash, other times it will crash 4 times back to back in the same area, which makes me very concerned about where I quicksave.   Compared to the rock solid performance and stability of DX:HR, this is a sad step backward, and a slap in the face to PC Gamers.   This is not quite an Arkham Knight situation, but it's close. I would recommend that people wait for a patch, or three before purchasing. The game is great, it's worth it. But unless you have a beast of a PC , and are willing to put up with a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you may find yourself quite frustrated by the experience of trying to play it.

Now, The story can get quite bland (No Spoliers). The whole story is a litteral waste of time, A stretch, And Gap-Fillers too. If your thinking of Gap-Fillers as answers, no. Its just to make the game longer, thats it. Solving plot points that dont even matter, and sub plotlines we dont even have answers to is extremely frustrating when comparing it to the previous deus ex. HR (Human Revolution) Had way more for it in the story, interesting plotlines, Tactic based boss fights, and the driving force in that game was truly honorable. But here, you have back and forth matters that dont matter. And it fills you with dread when you dont have alot of action or a good story to keep you entertained. Straight 15-20 hours of boring non-immersive quests that conclude with no award what so ever. Not even answers, And truly this feels like an short film compared Deus Ex HR. Just Average. 5/10  And well, It is Next-gen So the graphics are pretty good as a standard, but not what its up against. Other Triple A titles have much better graphics then this in due time of 1-2 years prior. This had an exclusive 4 years to have had much better graphics and more play ability. What Im saying is better graphics and more frames, ya? So I am not impressed with Square Enix ATM. 9/10  Immersion, The immersiveness in this game is tested greatly by the Graphics and world surrounding you, Would you agree? But the Dialogue and The use of 'shoulder shrugging' to express the main character and sub characters actions, is very dissapointing to see. I feel like Im just watching a really bad movie with real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ actors in it. You see minimal movement to express any thoughts or feelings when talking to other characters within the game. So it feels like your talking to damn robots. except they're augmented people. with non-augmented faces. The dialogue on the other hand with other characters breaks so much immersion, for the most part you really do feel like your talking to robots, they have rarely any change in the tone in their voice, and it ♥♥♥♥ing seems like they dont give a ♥♥♥♥. + for the lip syncing (its terrible) 4/10  Action, The action is so rare to find in this game, Its so boring you have make up your own action. Sure this game is mainly built around stealth and infiltrating, but I will argue there is absolutely no consequences if you screw up the stealth mission, unless your out of ammo, or if its damned required to stealth. And even of you do unleash your scarface playstyle, it is still no fun when it comes to action. Now, the takedown animations are cool, but can get really old after awhile. Aside from that Im giving this a 2/10 for action.  Moving on to the last part of this review, Glitches and Bugs. Phew, Im damn glad im done with the game. Because I cant tell you how many times I had to jump 3 feet in the air, just to get on a sidewalk, and then it ruined my so called stealth mission. I dont know if its intentional or not, but they need to fix it. And I run up the stairs much slower than I can walk up them? Huh? Is this a ♥♥♥♥ing joke?, Unless Im moonwalking up the stairs, there is no reason why I should be running slower than my walk up the stairs aside from that I have no complaints. 7/10  My conclusion?

There's plenty of side quests to keep you busy, and overall with world building Eidos did a much better job here than with Detroit.   The graphics are top notch, albeit with some optimization issues they need to fix. That's ok, just turn off MSAA, switch volumetric lighting to on/off, and have contact hardening shadows to on/off as well. Nothing is perfect, give the developers a break, it's hard enough to squash bugs and design an entirely new game engine.   If you're complaining the price, you can get it on green man gaming for $45.

I thought this mechanic was quickly getting old in video games, but also gave me a reason to spend my points on rebuilding my skill tree instead of just basking in OP augmentations.  However, the one factor that makes me no recommend this game, is the game breaking crashes. There are certain parts of the game where you will suddenly black screen.

The part in Golem City where you climb the rafters to sneak into the enemy base   Your apartment when attempting to call your old boss David Sarif   Most likely other parts of the game I have not gotten to yet.     These black screens actually harm your GPU. I had to restart my computer several times. This is completely unacceptable and can damage your hardware, making it very expensive to replace. Shame on you Nixxes. My specs are high enough to run the game smoothly @60FPS with the above mentioned settings turned off. Yet I still black screen, and only in specific areas of the game. I remember when HR was release 5 years ago. My laptop at the game was built for gaming, I had it only for two years, and it started having hardware issues with black screening after HR, which totally messed up my GPU.  I can't recommend the game in this current form, please wait until they fix this issue. I don't really care about Microtransactions. Just don't buy them.",

STORY seems ok, nothing to write home about, GRAPHICS are amazing but it needs a very demanding PC and even there you might have some FPS problems.  The REAL ISSUE is that the game feels strangly unsatisfactory. The movement made me feel like I was a floating camera, like I wasn't really there and many features like AI and NPC behavior just reinforced that feel. (no matter how many tweaks to controls, blur, FOV, etc I made)   I find it very inconsistent in terms of controls, the mouse acceleration, the cover system, I can't pinpoint the exact problem but it feels wonky and unsatisfactory to move, aim, shoot, etc. I didn't feel like I was in control and flowing in the game world.  Combat feels weak, some animations of takedowns are off, bullets from most guns feel tiny and the impact it makes on enemies makes it feel gamy (the sound of the weapons did not help either).  Lip sync sucks as some facial animations.  To put it sumply the game breaks immersion a every aspect I loved the original Deus Ex and loved HR and this does not feel like those, is like a flawed aproctimation, uncanny, almost but not quite, it's weird.",

If, as a community we continue to support games that agressively push micro transactions in game, DLCs that should have been included in the base game and other suspicious marketing strategies, we are going to witness the worst gaming era ever.  For a game that in its philosophy and story points out the injustices of a particular system, it is a shame to see that those behind the game are the one perpetuating those said injustices and unfair systems.  What does the industry needs to realise that they are being the bad guys ? More Piracy ? Probably not, the way to get rid of a system is to progressively replace it with a new system. And the way to do it is for buyers to put their money on games that are a reflection of this new system. Hopefully the Indie scene will be the one providing.",

The environments/level design felt pretty 'cramped', there's not much location variety, you still can't do much with NPCs other than going through their very basic 'main story progression' or 'pointless fluff' dialogues (can't do much 'romancing' as in other RPG games by Bioware/CDPR), there's not much 'choices' to be made which affects the story (well, there's actually one major choice you're forced to make, the rest are pretty much irrelevant), the developers underpromised on the whole 'DX12' part - yes, they have finally enabled this mode after many weeks, however by this time it is pretty much irrelevant for vast majority of players. Not to mention the ending was pretty abrupt and what's even worse - once again I was forced to watch 'end credits' with a bunch of irrelevant (to me) names and photos of the developers of the game (and random people who were somehow related to it), without the ability to skip those (I just used Task Manager to force-close the game after about a couple of minutes). Come on, guys - let ME have a control of MY own PC, if I want to skip all this narcissistic fluff you put in 'end credits' - let me easily and instantly do just that.  Long story short, the overall experience with this game was pretty... annoying and I'm glad I didn't pay a full price for it and neither should you.

Straight up fire fights are more viable. It introduced some great ideas but ultimately the game and game world aren't long enough or big enough to fully take advantage of them. The story was like a side story rather than tackling the overall conspiracy. With all that in mind, the best way to describe it is Human Revolution 1.5. Not a proper sequel.

Also it's only on iOS and Android and for some reason it apparently doesn't unlock the points in the PS4 version of the game. -Another mobile app to check some weirdo scannable tags you find in the game (not 100% sure how this one works) -Pre-order DLC all over and a Season Pass that is probably quite overpriced -And here comes the kicker....

But the ending isn't disappointing because of the story, but really because of how it was shuffled together. It doesn't have any impact, and honestly just frustrated me.  WHY THE ENDING IS DISAPPOINTING: ( Without spoiling the story )  After you complete the final mission, you are brought into another cut scene. A cut scene which serves no other purpose other than recapping what you have done, and what choices you've made in the game (In the form of a Picus TV broadcast featuring Eliza Cassan).  After the broadcast concludes, it fades to black.... No lingering final phrase of existentialism from Adam Jensen's lips, something I was really looking forward to. Instead we get to sit through ~15 minutes of slow rolling credits and 'Silly' picutres of the developement team.   I don't think any of them realize how vain the decision to put crew photos in was, not to mention how it destroys any sense of awe this game could have had at the end. And to add insult to injury, the credits are interupted by a teaser for a sequel. Then only to go back to more meta pictures of idiots and their names (which you cannot skip or speed up btw, and which you have to sit through if you want the achivement for completing the story).

On an ATI card I had no crashing or game-stopping problems as of 9/12. A lot of people are upset about the microtransactions, and while on principle we can make hay out of this all day, it has zero impact on the meat of the game - I wouldn't know it existed if I hadn't read about it.   Having said that, what ultimately soured me on the game was the multitude of minor and thoughtless, but ultimately endless, fumbles on execution.  Acceptable gameplay hours, but the story doesn't possess the scope or heights of previous entries. They're obviously aiming for an arc, but it leaves what is presumably the first part of it fairly mundane and disappointing. In their favor, the side missions are far more fleshed out than previous ones, but their success only serves to underscore the mediocrity of the primary plot.  Having only a single hub leaves you running into later areas early and looting them dry. I couldn't count the number of times I had to go back to a building with enemies who seem not at all surprised about every door and computer being unlocked, every security system being disabled, and a pile of discarded items in the middle of the floor.  Gameplay achievements can be broken by storyline choices. If you're going for a no-alert run, google GARM and foxiest of the hounds or you'll wind up with 25 hours of wasted effort. Further story and endgame achievements are locked behind a mandatory credit roll that otherwise has to be task killed to stop - to make it worse, it's nothing but arrogant pictures of the devs being drunk and/or stupid.  Tons of lazy bugs. Dumpsters that go flying when you brush against them. Knocked out enemies that continue to groan and contort minutes after being knocked out. AI that's confused on when it should and shouldn't be upset.  Overall, it's a sophmore effort.

The games mechanics are the same solid quality as they were in the Human Revolution, in both good and bad: Sneaking is fun and exiting and yealds the most EXP, meaning if you want to play with all the cool augs you better get them 'smooth operator' and 'ghost' bonuses. Fighting has somewhat improved: there are now augs that support more violent playstyle (especially the TITAN-aug) but you can no longer kill people with heavy objects (or at least I wasn't able to) which is a shame. Weapons in the game are somewhat disapointing (except the new stun-pistol which kicks ♥♥♥). There's no LMG's or Missle-launchers in the game which is great shame for there finally is areas with big open spaces with loads of enemies where one could effectively use them (either for crowd-controll with EXTREME PREJUDICE or to blow clusters of enemies into paste) No cross-bows or laser-rifles to spice up the game-play with alternative strategies (such as pinning bodies in the walls with the cross-bow or shooting trough the walls with the laser-rifle) What weapons we do have are functional but they lack balls: the new battle-rifle sounds like a cheap BB-gun (phft-phft instead of ear-drum shattering BANG-BANG) and the revolver doesn't have the same punch as the old one (also the both 'special revolvers' suck just as much) There is apparently a grenade-launcher in the game but I didn't find it and none of the merchants had one for sale but that's more of a problem with the game-design than the player (for I could found multiple ones in the DE:HR). Hacking has mostly stayed same from the first one but the interface is more cluttered and it feels clunky to use but luckily they removed the pointless aug to 'analyze' the nodes (now there's a hacking program for that and it gets just about as much use).  I was hoping that the big delay they had in the development would allow every aspect of the game be bigger and better. While this is true for technical aspects of the game, the writing and the story got seriously shafted. I will pass the factoid that they selected the most ♥♥♥♥ ending in the DE:HRs 'ending-o-matic' (I.E the one were everybody dies) to be canon. Instead lets focus on the new story that has no subtlety: the main conspiracy is immediately explained to us by our new lady-friend instead of letting us figure it out ourselfs before revealing it for those who didn't take time figuring it out (like the malfuntioning bio-chip element in the first one). The game just says: These are the bad guys, this is what they want to accomplish, these guys are the patsies for the bad guys and this is why we must stop them both. Main and side-characters are in no better position: none of them evolve or reveal hidden characteristics: they all stay in complete stasis and just play their stereotypical roles (I.E No nonsence boss stays as trict and our rival continues to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trough the whole game). There are no twists in the story: bad guys stay bad guys, patsies stay patsies and Adam Jensen stays uninterested about the whole ordeal around him. Or maybe there are some twists later in the story. Too bad that the story ends before the halfway point: Is like DE:HR would've ended after the first visit Hengsha (Is almost like somebody cut the game up so they could sell the rest of the story as DLC but that would be just silly). This ending makes the 'Ending-o-matic' in the first game seem ingenius in comparison: At least the story was properly wrapping up by the time we reached it.  In conclusion: If they had given the game longer development time (2-3 years atleast) it might have become a worthy sequel to Human Revolution but in its current state it leaves a bad impression on both itself and the people behind it.

This game has save file DRM to protect their precious microtransactions. That would be all good if it worked fine but, when does DRM ever works fine? Well then. If you have the misfortune to use any microtransaction items (including the bonus ones from preorder), then apparently, you're not allowed to reinstall your game or install it from another machine or, I'm not even joking here, even moving it to a different installation directory without losing your saves (and of course, your bonus items that you PAID for, since they are one-time-redeem only).  I'm speechless.  Game companies: If you spent less time and effort developing hideous DRM and spent that effort instead into making your game work, then maybe, just maybe, we wouldn't have all these day 1 apocalypse releases.  Just look at The Witcher 3, you can get it DRM free from GOG, and it works flawlessly. Now, go ask CD Projekt RED if they went bankrupt or something for not investing on hard DRM.",

            "review_text": "I expected about 20 - 30 hours more out of this game. I was sadly dissapointed.  Reader beware, spoilers follow here:  MY BACKSTORY:  I am a massive fan of the Deus Ex games and have played all of them. Continuing from the success of Human Revolution, I could not wait for this game.  SIDE MISSIONS:  The game started of good. A few graphics issues that was patched quickly and did not really bother me as I was more into the story line and side missions. I started playing the side missions and REALLY enjoyed it. The side missions are this games strong point. I felt that there was an insane amount of detail put into the side missions, perhaps a lot more than the main missions. When I started playing the game, I ended up so far invested into one side mission that I played almost 10 hours to complete the one side mission because it was really fun and immersive. The attention to detail in the side missions are really what makes this game, and also points of interest that you randomly encounter. You break into someone's apartment, hack their computer, read their emails and all of a sudden you feel like you can realte to the person, you feel like you want to help the person and before you know it, you are hours into a trail you are following because you are just interested. That I really enjoyed.  MAIN MISSIONS:  There were a couple of good main missions, and by a couple a mean literally only a few, however, it was over way too fast. On the loading screens, you keep seeing images of awesome looking places like the city built by the augmented and another one of a facility built inside of the ocean. A lot of cool places that you never get to see or play. I couldnt wait to go to the city built by augs, however you only get to see the aug slums city. You also hear about a facility in Switzerland where it seems that Megan, your ex, apparently works and it seems she is part of the group who created the 'orchid'. So I thought to myself, cool, Ill probably end up there some time later to shut the production of this weapon down. Nope, wrong, you never even go there. Then, when you use the augmented reality chair in Millers Office, you see the Chinese Billionare who is actually responsible for the killing of Talos Rucker. So you never get to fight him and you never even go to Hong Kong ?! You bascially go to prague and then you go to the slums right outside of prague and then you go to london for your first boss fight and then the games over.  To be honest, it feels wrong giving this game a bad rating because I am a big fan of Deus Ex and I really liked some aspects of this game, however, I expected at least another 20 hours of gameplay where you actually find out the rest of the story line. You are left with so many untold narratives leaving the player completely confused. When I saw the credits rolling I was shocked and was very dissapointed. To be honest, when I was fighting the only boss, I was thinking to myself, cool, when I kill him I'm probably going to head back to prague and then have a mission debrief and then try to track down the chinese billionare responsible for this. I thought that me, Alex and Janus were going to work as a team to track the rest of the 'bad' guys down and put an end to them. Nope, apparently not. I am really dissapointed in the lack of storyline in this game.  A LITTLE BIT OF CREDIT:  I must give ferral interactive credit for making a pretty good linux port, I guess thats one good thing that came out of this. The graphics is amazing, especially the faces, and once they patched the issues, it performed pretty good. The attention to detail on the side missions was the best I have ever seen in any other game I have played.  TL;DR (Spoilers)  The side missions are great and practicly make this game. The main storyline is great and has a lot of potential, however it ends abruptly, with only a few main missions, leaving the player confused with tons upon tons of unanswered questions and untold storyline. Only a single boss fight. The only reason I have 43.2 hours on record is because of the side missions. I guess only about 15 hours of that was spent playing the main missions.",

I.e. something as simple as moving an object around in your inventory can be tedious. This is a flashy remake of the Human Revolution console port; new production, story, and graphic technology with little game developement. The step-by-step functions of the game remind you of this. Game content is minimal and playthrough is short, ending with little opportunity to explore many of the new augmentations without playing the game multiple times. Game is not worth $60USD, maybe $40USD and an optional $20USD worth of microtransactions; this is assuming the game functions properly and not like a beta console port at final release. Not recommmended at $60USD price point(especially not with micro-transactions); wait for a Holiday sale and get the DLC(s) at a proper value.",

Unfortunately the story driving it is weak in comparison to both those earlier titles. I haven't finished the game yet at the time of writing, and I'm not feeling inspired to work toward it either. There are some enjoyable moments, but ultimately the game lacks the pacing and sense of urgency that HR had, and you quickly begin to loose interest in what's happening with the story. It's a far cry above Invisible War where the gameplay suffered just as much as the story, but ultimately it's still a low compared to the series high standards.  It's like MGSV: The Phantom Pain in a lot of ways. Excellent gameplay with a poor story and a real sense of descalation compared to what came before. But while TPP can be sumarized with that explanation, fullstop, DXMD also has a load of corprate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttery that nobody asked for. Microtransactions in singleplayer are annoying, but having terrible performance and unecessary DRM is inexcusable on publisher Square Enix's part. I honestly feel that if the devs at Eidos Montreal (who clearly care for the franchise and didn't appreciate having to bow down to corprate) had been left to their own devices, we'd have gotten a better game.  So should you buy it? I'd say no. Not now anyway. There's a genuinely amazing game in here somewhere, but just the fact that I can more readily name off more bad than good shows MD is a step down as a package from HR. Wait for a GOTY or Director's Cut edition or something, and then wait for a sale for that around $10-15. If you got it as a gift or something though, you should definitely give it a go sometime.",

Graphicly it was ok but I expected a little more, Eliza looked off, sure the story kind of explained it but in comaparison to the rest of the game world she looked like a CGI news anchor, how the hell was she supposed to be fooling the world around?

(I guess that sixth month delay wasn't for QA)  TL:DR Short story, dissapointing end. Buy on sale.   Deus Ex Mankind Divided really should have been titled 'Deus Ex Universe:Chapter 1: Prague'   Since that's really what this game is in terms of narrative development. Gameplay wise the attention to detail and level design have all vastly improved over it's predecessor, and this is where the game shines. The Hub worlds are large and have secrets everywhere waiting to be discovered. This is what the game does best, it plays and feels like a Deus Ex game worthy of the title.   But as soon as the game starts actually getting into some of the plotline laid out in the fancy CGI trailers, it's cut off by the screen telling you you've unlocked New Game+. There are so many threads left deliberately open ended to sell you on the next game. For all I know, they intend to pull a 'Assassins Creed' and build new levels on award winning mechanics with a scrap of plot movement in the last segments of the game. Deus Ex Mankind Divided isn't...bad. Falling prey to the same failures that Invisable War did. If you're looking for a good game to get your hands on and knock some people out cyberpunk style it's great!   Not to mention, Breach! The game mode is kinda nifty I've been digging it. What annoys me is the attention to detail that's been given to it that may have detracted from the core campaign. A 'live' semi-online game mode is the modern trend these days and so here we are. It's got some fun levels to ghost/shoot your way through.   As a fan of everything that made Human Revolution so great well, 'I never asked for this.'    (I'm a rather large fanboy, I'll keep on playing this game. But what it's worth I can't reccomend it to anyone else. Play Deus Ex Human Revolution.)",

Isn't it strange how Deus Ex games always end up associated with something weird? The towers in the first game, the engine in HR(was the biggest problem if that game, in dire need of augmentation...), the 'corporatocracy' in MD? DEUS EX IS ILLMINATI CUMFIRMED!!!1!1!111....    TLDR: It's bad when the publisher ♥♥♥♥s up a bad game even more, like EA did with Battlefront. It's worse when the publisher ♥♥♥♥s up a really good game. Mankind Divided is a really good game. Buy it in 2 years when it has all the pieces available.  Review: My opinion on this game is quite  divided . On one hand I am extremely impressed by the game's exposition of the world and environmental storytelling - superb, and the levels are some of the best I have ever seen in any game to this date. On another hand what was done to the rest of the game makes me loose faith in  mankind .  Mankind Divided  deus  an  ex cellent job at rewarding exploration. For an exploration fan like me, it is a joy to play. The gameplay is also solid and very varied, albeit really easy (played on Give me Deus Ex). Levels are extremely non-linear and sometimes truly vast in size, considering the level of detail. Enemies are also quite smart and the AI behaviour feels natural. They don't magically know where you are if they didn't see you, but neither do they ignore a gunshot because the 'bar didn't fill up'. Also I like the searching algorithm. It adapts to environment and is completely unscripted. You actually have to move your ♥♥♥ if they find evidence of your activity if you don't want to get caught. There's also a way to just shoot everything if you are a heathen like that.  Side quests are a jewel of this game, because unlike the main plot, they are actually complete and not cut into pieces to sell separately. They show that the team is very capable of producing good writing, good characters and good plots, which is why I have such a strong suspicion that most of this game's issues are caused by the publisher and not the development team.  That was it on the good bits. The bad bits: there are microtransactions in a SP game. Enough said. ... ... NO THAT'S NOT ♥♥♥♥ING ENOUGH! There's also a vital story mission cut out for pre-order bonus - a mission that has TON of build up in the story, which never gets acted upon unless you pre-ordered, quit the main story at the right moment, launch the mission, complete it, then go back to main story, so it actually ♥♥♥♥ing makes sense. Disgraceful.  They also cut out the ending. I am willing to bet the game's price on the fact that we will see the proper ending for this game 'just €19.99' or something like that in the near future. And you'll buy it, because ofc you will. In addition to all that, it seems like a lot of loose ends and good characters are left hanging for what seems like 'DLC injection points'. Because why make a good game AND good DLC, when you can make a good game, cut it into pieces and make DLC out of those?  I noticed one legitimate problem that is in the game by design though (i.e. couldn't have been caused by the publisher): people are right about lack of area variety. While existing levels are absolutely sublime, there aren't that many of them and they don't feel as different from each other as levels in Human Revolution were. The most interesting and different area that I was in was actually the last one - in London, with some nice mixing of off-limit and civil indoor areas, combining public places and office layouts. Prague is one of the best city hubs level-wise that I have ever seen, but I agree - it's just one. Perhaps it would have been better not to have such a big and detailed hub, but have multiple but in different parts of the world. Prague has multiple districts, but they all feel similar (ofc they do - they are in the same city).  Also it has dodgy optimization at times and 21:9 is not supported. It only crashed once for me though. Also there's some sort challenge mode with leaderboards? Why? Oh right: microtransactions. Gotta have some kind of motivator to buy items. And I HIGHLY doubt they did that mode just because they completed the game and still had some extra money left...  To have the gall to defile a Deus Ex game. And good Deus Ex game at that... This, Square Enix, I will never forgive. Not buying any of their games at full price ever again. No matter what they do (unless they release the rest of Mankind Divided as free updates). And I encourage you all to do the same. Get the Director's Cut of this game on sale later, you won't be disappointed: Edios Montreal are a VERY talented studio and they didn't loose their talent with this game that is clear to see.",

PPS:Pet peeve of mine: unsinkable intro, ohhh that I hate so much.  Additions after finishing the game, SPOILER AHEAD : got through the game after all, I manage to forget a bit about the bugs by blaming them on Adam's augs glitching, yes even that man I saw going through a wall in front of me.   Well the ending is a tad disappointing, yes there is a big bad guy, who is maybe not so much of a big bad guy, but who knows it never really pop ups in game beside a couple of chat with the TF29 's doc, so meh.   But what's mostly disappointing with the ending are the bloody cliffhangers: there are a truck load of them; hope you are ready to spend more money on DLC boys and girls, never mind you paid full price for a full story !   Wanna know where Adam's new augs come from ? Though luck !  Wanna know who Janus is ? Too bad !  Wanna get resolution on TF29 'corruption' ? Nope !  Wanna discover who is pulling the strings (not through cinematics where Adam isn't present)? Not gonna happen !   So yeah 'hopefully' all of this will be answered in DLC and if it's the case, it's a really awful business practice.  My recommendation hasn't changed, wait for the price to drop, the bugs to be fixed, all the DLCs to be out and the micro-transaction server to be dead.   PS : The bloody end credits are unskipable !

            "review_text": " TL;DR: Game breaking bugs, short and terrible storyline, save your money.   I normally don't write reviews, I leave that to other, more literate people. However, my experience with this game is so bad I feel the need to warn people away from it.  First off, my setup includes an ultrawide (21:9) monitor, and this game has horrible optimization problems with that. To their credit, they have released a patch that fixed *some* of the problems, but not everything has been fixed. Furthermore, it would either stretch the game, or not run at all when I tried to change the resolution to 1080p (16:9). I had to resort to changing my system resolution to play it properly. Is it really that hard to release a game that doesn't have game breaking issues?  Onto the gameplay. To be fair, the gameplay is quite well done, which is what got me through the issues. Levels are intricately made, and exploration is rewarded with secret passageways and a lot of loot. Gun play, on the other hand, can still be improved. Shooting feels sluggish and changing weapons are a hassle (I played with a controller so the shortcut bar was unavailable). I found myself sneaking through the entire game to avoid that.  But my main problem, along with game breaking bugs, is the fact that the story is so poorly written and so short, I can't help but wonder why it took 5 years for this game to be released. I finished the game with 15 hours logged, and that includes all but 1 side mission, along with around 2 hours of trying to fix aforementioned bugs. 13 hours for a $60USD game!? Even DX:HR was longer than that! Characters are underdeveloped, and some were shown in the beginning, but never again until the endscene AFTER the credits rolled. The villain wasn't given a proper backstory, and I still don't know why he did what he did. Choices didn't matter, whether you sided with the police or the Augs.   The ending depends on 2 choices you make in 2 missions. At least in DX:HR I can choose between 3 buttons!   The ending itself felt like it was cut short, I had more questions then I had answers after the credits rolled.  All in all, the game felt like a cash grab, which is disappointing because I loved the last game. A lot could have been done better, but they decided to release an unpolished crap to make some money. I guess that's the trend these days.",

Graphics are very nice and smooth, I think I saw just 1 graphical glitch. The early game was a bit unstable and i had maybe 5-6 crashes in my playthrough but near the end it was fine and no crashes or bugs.  But I do not recommend buying this game, atleast not at it's current price. For it is extremely lack luster in contend.   Bottomline, this game is 10 hours faster to complete for me doing every single side mission, than human revolution was rushing through because i was excited about the story, and i was playing on the hardest i could. I think it's a huge disappointment, the moment the story even begins to progress the game ends.

It's engaging enough for a little while if you got no friends to play with and nothing else to do. But this is not worth your money if you have nearly anything else you want to buy.  Here is some of my more problems with the game in a bit more detail:  1. The skills. The basic skills are exactly the same as in Human Revolution, though near the end of HR i had most perks and could perform nearly everything. That isn't the case in this game, you spend most of the game getting the perks you had in HR, and then it's over. I tried only 1 of the new perks before the game finished.  Just 1.   And are you feeling like it sounds like I didn't do enough to get all the skills? Then you are right, i didn't find every hidden praxis pack or spend all my ingame money on buying them, not that it matters since i managed to get 13k credits in my entire playthrough and a praxis kit cost 10k. So I could have bought 1 praxis.    No you see, in the game menu, there is a shop, where you can buy Praxis kits, for your singler player game. With real money.If you want to see the full contend of the skill tree in 1 play through you have to pay them money for it.",

As a DLC however it is much too short and meaningless - I think I finished it in ~30 min while also sweepeing through the entire level for emails/pocket secretaries.  I don't advise buying this at the current price of 60+ EUR (with DLC); best wait for a heavy discount at some Steam sale. As a die hard Deus Ex fan (I've played all) I am quite dissapointed. Having played once through it, I wouldn't pay more than 15 EUR for the whole package as it stands now.  ",

The characters I could of enjoyed alot more but little to no development for them in a game I spent over 20 hours on, in the first run, Alex and Mac had alot of potential for me to be very good characters but nothing came of it.  The story has some moments, but feels lackluster and the ending made me feel like there was another 10 hours left before I realised the credits started. It would be like if Human Revolution ended when you got onto the ship. Money grab to get you to buy the DLC to finish the story.   It ran pretty well on my rig with a steady 40 fps on a GTX670 at mostly high with a few intensive options off.  If the story is not a big deal breaker for you, go ahead and get it. I found the gameplay fun enough but the poor story puts me off it. Wait for some complete edition in a years time if you want it.  Replay Human Revolution for a better overall game.",

Despite being graphically stunning, Mankind Divided is a terrible Deus Ex game (but fairly fun as a game in itself.)  There are effectively four missions in the game and one of those is a tutorial. Sure, there is a lot to do in exploring Prague (which is a wonderful setting and Mankind Divided does an excellent job as realising the city as a near future city on the edge.) However, exploring Prague never feels like a substantial part of the experience and is a poor substitution for scripted content.  Mankind Divided's virtues are superficial and its flaws are deep. Tacked on micro-transaction heavy breach mode is the most obvious of its failings, and it doesn't take very long for the busywork to start feeling like a game by UbiSoft.  I don't feel robbed for my time, but I also don't regret putting the game down for nearly a week after my first day with it to play games that embody more of what Deus Ex was about than this. If you wanted a smart, branching narrative, then you will be moderately disapointed as well. This has a dumb, forked narrative. (e.g. the big mid-game reveal is that Bob Page, the villain from the first game and one of the Illuminati, who the game heavy-handedly tells you are the badguys, is the villain.)

The stealth mechanics and level designs are great, the RPG elements work well, and the environments and city-spaces are beautiful. Some of the side quests are pretty good. All improved on from Human Revolution.  Quite honestly, it's some of the best stealth gameplay I've ever encountered with level design absolutely unmatched. The developers deserve a LOT of credit for it.  So, what then, is the problem here? Primarily, the writing and story pacing is abysmal. I don't think this is readily obvious at first. Contrary to what others say, I think the beginning bits of the game all work out quite nicely in terms of plot and conflict setup.  That being said, I'll warn that spoilers follow, as I want to explain just what exactly is wrong here.  The problem with the game isn't setting up meaningful conflicts and story threads, the problem is a failure to deliver on these potential conflicts and threads in any meaningful way. In some sense, the story's total failure to deliver on numerous tensions and threads in the story makes me feel like I just played the 1st half of a 2-part game. It's astonishing, really.  Nearly all the characters seem like they are going to go through some sort of arc, development or evolution but do not. There seem to be tensions between characters that are being built up for some sort of development later, but nothing is ever delivered. What happened to this game? I honestly want to know.  Jensen feels remorse for trying to make the world a better place but seeing the results of his decision in HR. So, naturally, one would assume that this idea would play into the story, what he does, what he thinks, and ultimately he would evolve his thinking about his actions. Instead, there is nothing. Just setup for something that the game doesn't deliver. Completely disappointing.  David Sarif never meets you in person, but is in contact with you for most of the game in relation to a sidequest about Jensen's 'mystery augments' that are *actually* very mysterious. What happened to Jensen after he was pulled out of the ocean? Who put the augments into him? Why do people involved in his augments turn up dead? What is going on here? I was totally shocked when the quest, and I'm not kidding here, ends with Sarif simply saying, paraphrasing here, 'Huh, doesn't make sense, pretty weird man' AND THAT WAS IT! I mean, what? There is NO way to justify this.  (I also miss Sarif's old voice actor, I liked him better)  They build up all this tension about whether or not Jensen can trust his superiors in the 'TF29' anti-terror group and deliver nothing. Jensen and his hacker buddy spend all this time suspecting the director, Miller, of being allied with the illuminati or whatever. The story reveals later that they were just wasting their time and there was nothing.  Now, see, during one of these missions, we're shown a whole sequence between these two illuminati characters 'Joseph Manderley' and 'Rob Page' that seems to imply they are really pulling the strings and Miller is innocent. Our hero and his ally, Vega, simply ignore this and press on.   I figured the game was setting us up for a reveal about these antagonists and their plans later, but, no, nothing happens. They are never seen again. Manderley and Page talk about their secret plans vaguely but we don't hear or see more of them after this, and the player does not confront or engage with them at all. Why? All of this feels like a script with literally half of the pages torn out.  In the middle of the game, the player tours Golem City, a segregated living space where the augs are kept separate from most of society and regularly abused. The game sets up an MLK-like figure in 'Talos Rucker' who seems to be sympathetic. He asks that the augs protest peacefully and respond to violence with love and compassion. I had figured, silly me, that the game wanted to aim for some commentary over the course of the story about social change and the different ways to accomplish it -- why violence doesn't work. They do set up a counterpart character to him, one who will use violence to achieve his ends, but there isn't really much delivery or reflection on their differences or why those differences are important.  The game plays around with all these broad, very human themes but doesn't go beyond surface level with any of them. Racism and fear stand out among them. The game makes a great show of the augs vs. naturals conflict and segregation. Mistreatment. Injustice. Etc. However, it doesn't actually talk about or reflect on these things in any meaningful way. It seems to think that they can just show brutality and bigotry and expect it to be meaningful on its own, without any further commentary or nuance. Its a shortcut the writers are using, and an obvious one. I am not impressed and, trust me, I waited patiently for the game to make it more meaningful, but it didn't.  Jensen, in particular, has a lot of opportunity to observe and reflect on these themes, being both subject to mistreatment as an aug and also exempt from it by having friends in high places -- somewhat of a 'Geralt-like' position in that respect. No delivery, though, like everything in this game.  Numerous other characters, themes and threads I'm not mentioning here had great potential but ultimately turned out to be nothing. What a waste.  There are around 12 side quests, a few of them with better arcs and writing than anything else in the game. 12 though, really?  By the time the game ends I felt like I had only started the game or was just finishing the prologue to the real game.  For a game with such solid stealth mechanics and level design, for a game that presents great choice in playstyle and approach, what a tragedy that it is such a mess in its pacing, writing and character development.  Make no mistake, this could have been a really great game, but it isn't. I'd advise picking it up when it's on sale for $20 or less.",

            "review_text": "Deus Ex (original) was a phenominal game because it married open-ended, intelligent gameplay with an open-ended, intelligent story.  This game expands slightly on the gameplay choices by offering new augments. Taking down guards and stacking them high is as satisfying as ever, whether you do so lethally or non-lethally. Creeping around hacking computers and reading emails is still fun. Crawling through vents, busting walls and leaping across electrified pools to find secret areas and alternate routes to objectives still makes you feel as though you're an ultimate badass exploiting the world to your whim.  But whilst the depth of gameplay is still there, the depth of story has utterly disappeared. Gone are the epic plotlines about worldwide government conspiracies, manufactured viruses, shadowy organisations, aliens and illuminati. Gone are the torturing moral choices and non-linear decisions. What we have here is a simple cut-and-dry case of a terrorist attack, which over the course of a few acts you uncover and then have to stop. There are no moral decisions, and no choices - even the two minor decisions you are asked to make during the game can be mitigated or bypassed.  The environments look beautiful on the surface. But there are only 3 or 4 of them. The majority of the game all takes part in the same small city, which despite some lighting variety in the red light district and the sewers is all fairly similar.  The screen filter effects are carried across from HR, which seems to be hiding a multitude of sins in the texture art and engine. Keycard models are assymetric, but they've used the same texture for both sides of the model (leaving a black triangle visible on the reverse). Walls tend to look poor up close. The stalls in Golem City were rushed. The red dot laser sight isn't ray traced - it's just a red sprite in the middle of the screen. Attention to detail is just poor throughout, which means that these gorgeous environments don't hold up to scrutiny.  This, added to the very obvious attempts to wean more money from a AAA-priced title (paid companion mobile app which adds Praxis and the option to directly pay to unlock more Praxis) leave a really bad taste in the mouth.  TL;DR - fun gameplay, disappointing plot, ultimately unsatisfying. If you enjoyed HR you'll probably enjoy this almost as much. If you loved the story of the original Deus Ex you'll be very disappointed.",

In HR, there are several bosses, each with a different, special tactic for fighting - The story is about 50% shorter compared to HR's - I found the experimental augs largely useless; I really stuck with the same ones I used in HR - Whilst I appreciate the hard work and creativity the dev team put into the game, there are few things that ♥♥♥♥ me off more than not being able to skip through credits. Yes, you guys are awesome, we get it - It seems like Breach mode took focus away from the amount of work they put into the main story. Yes, it's interesting and different, but it seems unbalanced  That said, I did really like these parts of the game:  - The crafting augmentation that allows you to break down exisitng items you don't want to create items you need (e.g. stim packs, hacking devices, energy cells) - The tranquilizer rifle and stun pistol make non-lethal combat a lot easier to perform stealthily. - At least two different concurrent languages makes the game a lot more immersive than others where voice actors just put on accents and speak in English. - The exo-skeleton 'heavies' and augmented footsoldiers that make combat more intense and tactical. - The beautifully crafted settings in each part of the story.

But it is not much of an improvement over the previous game and its add-on (that is, if you liked the old Deus Ex games (DX, DX2, DX3) and prefer PC controls and game mechanics).  It's basically a cover shooter. The first person controls and gameplay experience does not work well. The first person controls feel weird and restricted (can't really strafe while moving forward?).  Other than that, the surroundings are well designed and it has nice references to cyberpunk topics and past and present politics.  Still, the sneak through air duct gameplay already became boring in the previous game. They really should improve there.  Some level design elements just feel too cube like to me. Does not feel believable. Everything is too shiny somehow. Everything is too much designed for sneak-cover-sneak gameplay. I prefer the old Deus Ex games' mechanics. Some reviews lead me to believe that it improved into that direction.  Feels too much like console gameplay to me. Also the menu controls are terrible on the PC (inventory, hacking). Should've done a real PC port with decent mouse controls.  Graphics are good and bad. A mix of great elements (hair), some nice effects, great models and textures and some really cheapish looking reflection effects that hurt in my opinion and make everything shiny.  If you look closely there is some weird shader noise effect on some objects that apparently can't be disabled.  I don't understand how the energy mechanic has improved, its still crippling. No Ghost in the Shell feeling comes up if you can run five meters in cloak before the battery runs out (if in the low empty state). And recharging kits are too limited in my opinion. I think it should allow a bit of action even if you are low on energy. But I guess this type of game is a pain to balance right. A bit more into dynamic gameplay would be nice though. Seems to punish that a bit. Probably because of the console type gamepad compatible game design. Remember the large outside areas of the old DX games? Missing this here so far, the gameplay just does not support that well.  Probably just not my type of game. Darnit, I wished they brought it closer to the old games or shooters like Neo Tokyo.",

Some of the fun buyers will get to look forward to: single player microtransactions, incomplete story threads (including the main plot), poor handling of the PC port (both graphics and controls), a slew of new underdeveloped characters with nonsensical motivations to add to the growing modern Deus Ex cast, and more! I'd recommend holding off on a purchase to get a steep discount. There are Telltale games on the market for $5 with more compelling and complete stories.   Totally regret this purchase and playing through HR a few weeks ago thinking this game would make any attempt to explain the open plot threads from that game. $5 for a one-time use tranq rifle, ammo, and grenades. One hub in the entire game. It's a mystery to the developers why this game is being received poorly after 5 years of development time.",

Grenades are a giant blurry firball, you shoot someone and they get a small red dot wherever you hit them and thats about it. Weapon effects are also very meh. Takedowns don't feel like real time since whenever you do one it just goes to a small cutscene. As far as story goes i'm not sure since I'm only in 4 hrs but I just don't feel like playing it.

However, due to the egregious use microtransactions and single use items (and improper explanations of them) combined with very poor performance I'm very tempted to refund the game (for reference, I'm having to run the game in 720p on medium to get a fps over 30 where I can run most current games in 1080p at 60fps on medium to high). From what I've experienced of the gameplay so far, it feels like just more Human Revolution but some of the systems feel clunky and I'm not a fan of the cover system this time round. This, coupled with the poor framerate and low graphical fidelity is making the gameplay feel stiff, although there is a lot of choice in the style of gameplay. Additionally, I'm finding the story less gripping than my first playthrough of HR and some of the dialogue is a little cheesey. All in all, a game that has great potential but has been spoiled by some poor marketing decisions and poor performance. I'd say get it if you like DE:HR, otherwise wait for a price drop, and do not buy the season pass, it’s a rip off.  Edit: After todays patch, I've seen a big increase in performance. The game has been stable at 1600x900 at mostly high at over 40fps. Reducing the UI size makes the screen feel a lot less cluttered although it still feels messier than HR. Using workarounds such as an early game save will mean you'll always have access to the single use items (my biggest problem with the game is the inclusion of these items, everything else could have been forgiven but single use consumables in a single player game are ridiculous and its a huge shame). I've decided not to refund the game, because whilst it may not be as good a game than DE:HR it is still a good game, just not one worth £40.",

When I was at EGX 2015 I watched the press release and considering this was pushed as a DX12 game it is currently locked for DX12. This game has not been optimised for PC properly which means even a Titan X Pascal has troubles running max settings 4k at more than 32 to 50fps.   Overall I expected a lot lot more from Eidos with this game and feel it has with some poor optimisation and micro transaction could have done a lot better. The only saving graces for this game are 2 things. Its Deus Ex and most of all It isnt quite as bad of a port as Batman Arkham Knight was. Yet it should not have been a port in the 1st place as origins of this game come from PC.  Please do understand I love this game and wish I could give it an amazing review. This game will be loved if you enjoyed Human Evolution. The graphics are a massive leap forward and am sure they will have any minor problems sorted quickly. It like many games lack certain things to make it amazing. But I will say it is good.  All this being said It is worth a play and I do hope Eidos learn for the next installment.",

Using the default difficulty, the game was a breeze with just the final level offering a hint of a challenge.   The story is no where near as ambitious or impactful as the first game, with the ending arriving way too abruptly and leaving you speechless in a bad way. Speechless because there is next to no closure in alot of the story arcs and they the ending is just a news broadcast of your actions throughout the game.   I cannot recommend this game yet only because of the abrupt end to the main game which very obviously means you NEED the story dlc to even consider this game as complete.

They were built for spreadsheets and data entry, not stealth games.  *I've only just begun the story, but it's already proving to be boring.

Game itself is good. Not great but good... it could be great which is the sad part.   My total gameplay for this thing was under 80 hours with a lot of backtracking to catch things I missed where with a game like Fallout 4 you end up with 100s of hours of gameplay. I know it's not fair to compare it with Fallout but still.   Why nobody on the development team has the sense to make the side missions like fallout where they are completely unconnected to the main story but don't take you out of the character and weapons that you spent HOURS building is beyond me. Foolish.   There are some weird graphics/sound issues with dialog (kind of like a badly dubbed movie)  Some awkward bits of gameplay.  Story kind of makes very little sense and kind of plays out like one of those action movies that has giant holes in the plot.   Could be better but still better than most games out there.

Pros:   - graphically sharp  - some interesting side missions and small, yet significant details that are easy to miss  - the first 10 hours or so has a gripping main story  - much improved gameplay mechanics regarding movement, cover/shoot, inventory Cons:  - ugh, where to begin.... the port was initially unplayable, crashed often, terrible stuttering, though this has since been patched to a playable degree; still not great  - the whole dang story is BARELY half a game, no doubt to charge players another few times for what should have been one game  - the 'villian' quickly shifts from the interesting actions of the illuminati to a pawn that is hard to care about at all; an insult to what made the predecessors so deep and enticing  - the only hub, Prague, is far too small to warrant the horrible need to constantly be going back and forth through the different districts via an incredibly annoying loading sequence; it seriously ruined many of the otherwise interesting side missions. This becomes even more bothersome with all of the unecessary cutscenes of the police checking your papers and insulting you about your augs. Then, it becomes game-breaking in the latter half for an obvious reason I won't spoil  - with this being the first game in the series that features the return of a main character, it's wasted due to the fact that none of the significant characters that we grew to care about in the prior game join Jennsen; likely a way to appeal to the larger audiance rather than the returning fans of the series  - micro transactions and day one DLC (which was used to mislead players into preordering) appear, meaning Square Enix prioritized this above all of the glaring issues in the port, as if paying at least $60 for barely half a game wasn't enough  I could go on, but I'd like to forget about such wasted potential as soon as possible.

Once I loaded in, the game also suffered from frequent and incredibly debilitating stuttering while walking around, which is no excuse considering that it's the second level of the game and also a centerpoint of the story. The hub area is ridden with bugs and a general lack of polish- skyboxes or cube map reflections (I'm not sure which) are visible in the metro when you jump, and in general taking the metro even for story missions is just asking the game to start stuttering.  This game is NOT worth buying until these issues are fixed.  Original Review:  It's basically more of human revolution with far shinier graphics and better combat. If you're a fan of DXHR, then this will be right up your alley.  Microtransactions are absolutely an insult to the franchise, but from what I've seen of them they are unnecessary and only really are appealing to those that have neither the time nor the patience to explore the levels and scavenge for their scarce resources (which IMO is actually one of the main pacing elements that really made DXHR). Buying them only really deprives yourself from enjoying the balance between combat and stealth that the game encourages.  Performance-wise, the game runs great on my GTX 970. While there are some settings (namely MSAA and volumetric lighting) that can literally cut framerates in half, using T-AA gets rid of most jaggies while not destroying shadow quality (I'm looking at you, Rainbow 6 siege).

Just remember to tweak your options settings before jumping right in- totalbiscuit's video on the PC version discusses the impact of settings in far greater detail that I can here, so go watch that if you don't like watching slideshows.

Overall, it's a good game, but right now it has massive performance problems - this is why it's not recommended for now.  - The Main Game - The Story is decent, the voice over feels a bit rushed, the gameplay fits in with the idea of the game. There is only one problem: many areas extremely favor either non-lethal or lethal - If you chose to do the other one, you better be quick and be lucky because that solid railing is not gonna block visibility. Stealth is an option and it's a rewarding one. Killing is also an option and you get to make a nice pile of bodies - my record is about 38 bodies before it crashed.  - Jensen Missions - Desperate Measures - Wow. This is like what, 5 minutes of gameplay with stealth/non-lethal? It's 15 minutes cutscenes and literally just arrive by train, go through corridors, open a door, have a cutscene, react accordingly to the prompts, get back to the train. Underwhelming.  - The Issues - This game is an insult to a high performance gaming PC: 1. Only uses up to 3 cores of your CPU. 2. Videos occasionally halt for a minute or two since it decided to stop preloading. 3. None of the graphics options actually help with framerate - I had the same 5-109 range with high as i had with low. 4. Reflections are off sometimes - I understand that local reflections (SSR) can't perfectly reflect behind an object, but impossible reflections should still be filtered out. The train sequence for example has multiple objects that reflected Jensens face - even though he wasn't facing them. 5. Menus are a pain in the argh to use with mouse. Why exactly doesn't the mouse jump to the notification window? Using a keyboard or a controller is better for this. 6. Streaming issues: A lot of zones load in very late, resulting in objects flipping out and once even resulted in me getting slammed out of the world by a physics prop that got stuck in another one. Well played, physics.  That is all for now. Until Issue 1, 2, 3 and 6 are fixed, this stays on not recommended.",

There is an ingame store, that allows you to buy Praxis Kits for real money. If you are sensitive to these kind of mechanics, do not buy the game. Me personally, I do not care about ingame stores and stuff. I have the prepurchase reward dlcs, but I disabled them, because usually these things only make the game easier and thus make it feel imbalanced.    I am enjoying it. Therefore I recommend it.  //edit: gotta change my opinion: A million bugs. To many flaws. Many crashes. Just some examples: Leaving the loading screen with space button makes you leave cover. If it is your only save game, this might ruin you whole 'ghost walkthrough'! It is a stealth game, for christs sake. All it takes is a person playing the game properly for 5 minutes, to find that bug. Finishing the shooting range makes the game crash. Cannot exit 'Use the TV remote' (Leave/Watch TV promt keeps popping up, after using 'Leave'). And so on...  Many bad design decisions like: Final credits screen not skippable. After the unskippable credits screen there is more story input. Biocell, Hypostim Injector not bindable to a key; you are forced to use the console quick-menu. 'Hold E' is used for 'Move Corpses/Bodies' and read mission updates/logs; pick up a log out of a body -&gt; try to pull it -&gt; opens the log... Just to name a few. Many more! Makes the game feel like it was rushed out and noone really took a closer look. I wonder why that is. Hundreds of people gotta work for years on a game like this; all it would take to improve it by A LOT, would be 1 test player, playing the game for 2-3 days!  Flawed cover system. It is working, but that is about it. Final battle is just bullcrap. Not like fighting an enemy in Doom, where you interact with your opponent. More like 'Oh we didn't have any boss battles, because people hated them in the previous game. But the game is almost over now. Let's add a boss, because.... you know... what would be a game without a boss.' Just abusive and seriously pointless fight. Just like in 'human revolution'.   Overall: Great game! Awesome fun, when it is working as intended. But to many flaws to give it a 'thumbs up'.  I recommend waiting 2-3 months, until everything is fixed.

After playing it all the way through, I found that the game is rather short compared to the last game, and the new DLCs are basically nothing worth even looking into. Square Enix failed. They turned a comepletely awesome experience into a one boss, very few side quest, rushed pile of junk. If only this had been given to a company that really cared -- cared about the story and content instead of trying to sell mini games and awkward DLCs.",
