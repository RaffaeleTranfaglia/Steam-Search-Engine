            "review_text": "Game does not hold up to expected danmaku standards, not worth 10 dollars, and not worth my time.  First off the hit box is bigger than any bullet hell I have ever played, what is this a platform game or a bullet hell? Second your 2 movement speeds are super slow and race-car fast, making complex maneuvers very awkward.. Also why is the default 1 bullet shot the final power.. why no power ups.. the game is just not fun, I beat it a single time on hard and now I will never play it again.. simply a bad game.  Lets be clear I'm always happy when people try to make new bullet hell games cause i love to play them, but there is a standard and this is SO far below it.. also why $10? seriously... this should be $2 max, and I know you have a demo if people don't like it but come on.  Anyway I hope you continue to make more bullet hells in the future, but please raise your standard and make some that are good... this is so far underpar I feel that I absolutely wasted my time.",
