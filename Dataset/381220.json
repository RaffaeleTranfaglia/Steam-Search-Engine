Got some interesting tactics, and even some metagame that can help support your chosen playstyle, though not a game-breaker if you chose wrong, which is nice.  My biggest comlpaint is that it has performance issues, probably a leak, because restarting the game fixes it. After playing for a while straight, the game starts lagging badly and becomes not fun. Hope they fix that one.",

I think that it is a cool defence game, both fun and challenging.  Overall a COOL game with some great new features :)",
