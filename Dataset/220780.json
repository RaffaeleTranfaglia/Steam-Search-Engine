            "review_text": "☺ Interesting, witty and engaging story. ☺ Lovely, minimalist art style. ☺ Good puzzle platforming.  ☹ Not very challenging gameplay. ☹ A little short.  Thomas Was Alone is a lovely and engaging platformer from start to finish that tells the tale of some plucky AI figuring out their place in the minimalist world they see themselves in. It features some good puzzles based around your team of AI working together to overcome the obstacles before them, each with their own unique ability and personality (which really shines through, despite being simple shapes, thanks to the narration work of Danny Wallace and some good writing).  While a little on the short side, it does manage to stay focused without any padding - although I would have liked the game to have continued for a bit longer with escalating difficulty. The game is quite slow paced with a soothing soundtrack which compliments the minimalist style and produces a rather relaxing experience which is topped off with decent controls that never caused frustration.  While easily recommended for fans of slower paced 2D platformers and those people who like a well written story, the length of the game (and lack of replayabilty) means I'd suggest waiting for a sale.",

Sadly soundtrack is not available for purchase but you can find it on YouTube.   Screenshots and reviews don’t do this game justice.  For the love of indie gaming go play this one.      P.S. There are 20 easy-to-miss extra levels (10.1 - 11.10) available through the Main Menu -&gt; Scenario Select with new characters and a new story. Don’t forget to play them! ",

Now, the main draw for myself was the narration, and at the end of the experience, the narration was the highlight. It is difficult to describe the connections you end up making with each little character as you progress, all due to the clever use of narration. All the characters have distinct personalities, and all of them end up sticking with the player. I eventually even had a favorite character, and all the while I realized how ridiculous it was that this character happened to be a rectangle with a color assigned to it. Each character has its own gimmick. Whether it is jumping high, being able to swim, fit in tight spaces, etc. These gimmicks create the puzzles that make up the entire game. Without them it would be quite bland. They are always exciting, and easy to understand as they are introduced cleverly. Do I recommend it? Yes I do. For those who want a slow-paced, narrative driven puzzler, this game is the best out there. I loved it. An experience I will remember for years to come.",

            "review_text": "Thomas Was Alone. Was. But not for long.   This short tale is a heart-warming story of equality, acceptance, sacrifice, and above all, friendship. You may think that the characters in this game are simple rectangles, but they are so much more. Each of them forms a strong character as they strive, as one, to their goal.   They quickly learn to accept their differences; nay, to embrace their differences, using each other’s strengths in order to overcome obstacles and complications which they would never be able to do by themselves, due to their own individual weaknesses and flaws.  Helping them to accomplish their destination, you will be challenged at times, but every time they get one step closer to their collective target will reward you and leave you feeling enthralled.   The game seems simplistic but it flows fluidly and artistically, accompanied with a charming, witty narrative and a beautiful soundtrack. The result: a game that comes together perfectly, filled with emotion and verve.   When I finished the game I found myself wanting to play more of it. Not because it is too short, but because I felt like I had personally connected with each of the characters and I wanted to spend more time getting to know them.  You will laugh, you will cry, but at the finale you will be captivated by this truly magical experience.",

The controls are extremely good, and the graphics, while very simple, match with the game's theme and mood.  The story is told via a narrator who recites both what the characters are saying and thinking, much like listening to an audio novel. The approach works well, and serves to anthromorphize characteristics onto what would otherwise be blank slates.  The game is short, and relatively easy - it can be beaten in around 3 hours with nothing additional left to see. That being said, it's a thoroughly enjoyable experience, and I think pretty much anyone would be able to have some fun playing it.",

There are some extra levels at the end that are not obviously shown to be part of a separate story - it made me think that the game had glitched and played the end credits before I had actually beaten the game. Then, after I played the expansion, I thought that the ending was inconclusive and disappointing.   However, I do recommend this game.

By only the tenth level I was already referring to blocks by their names (Thomas, Chris, Claire, etc.) and being that their only physical differences are their shape, size, and color... yeah.

It may not be the most revolutionary, but it seems perfectly made, with nothing that seems bad such as glitches, annoying gameplay, or boring sections.

I didn't feel like I accomplished anything through finishing this game nor getting all of the achievements (which simply required you to look a bit closer at the screen for most of them) that were scattered through the levels.  The music was relaxing to listen to in the background, nothing too extravagant. However, whenever the music changed, the old music would not cease, causing a clashing between multiple songs. I'd need to reload the game in order to reset it, and it would be quite frustrating for me if I didn't do so.  The story it told wasn't too bad. I thought it was humorous and unique to give each quadrilateral a personality and a goal, but the rest was too abstract for my tastes. At the later, later levels, it felt a little bit rushed however. Those who have played to that point may know what I mean.  If you enjoy an easy puzzle game to kill about 3-4 hours of time while listening to a simple story through good narration, you may like the game. But personally? I was hoping for a puzzle game that required some more thinking through what I thought seemed like promising concepts, but it was a more of a story where flipping the pages required your time and tedious 'puzzle solving.' I bought this game on sale at 75% off, but for its full given price tag, I would not recommend it, nor would I recommend this game to those looking for a challenge in their puzzles that requires more than quick sight and simple action.",

And the story really is what kept me hooked, or the narration. Probably both, as one goes with the other.  The soundtrack is excellent as well.  Levels are rather simple to do for the most part; getting 100% achievements is no deal.  This isn't a game meant to challenge or frustrate you -- at least I don't think it is. If that was their intention, they failed horribly. The gameplay merely connects the story pieces, and since most of the narration is at the beginning of a level, you don't really want to spend hours trying to figure out how to complete it.  However, for what it does, the gameplay works very well. I used a XBox-360 controller so I can't judge the keyboard controls, but the game did exactly what I told it to do. As you progress through levels, Thomas will eventually no longer be alone, but except for a few levels at the end, no two characters are identical. The narration even assigns them personality; in terms of gameplay they have different sizes, jump lengths and possibly other abilities, so you need to combine them appropiately to get everyone to their designated exit point.  All in all, if you're looking to maximize hours/buck, go elsewhere. If you like to try a simple game with an excellent presentation and execution that -- in my opinion -- doesn't fail at anything it attempts to do, go for it.",

This is a puzzle platformer using multiple different colored rectangles that have different 'abilities'. Some jump higher than others, some float in water, some can fit into tight spaces. What makes this game cool is the good writing that gives names and character to the rectangles as if they were people. This makes the game a bit interesting and you'll push through the puzzles just to hear the next bit of narration. They did a good job of making the characters 'interact'. Note that it is all narration and no dialogue.   There are a lot of levels in this game and some of them are a lot of fun. However, some are overly simple and there seemed to be even more of them toward the end. About 3/4 of the way through the game, the mechanics will change slightly, which was a welcome thing, but it also takes away your 'characters' and gives you new ones. There is an 'ending' and I will give them credit for the story leading to it properly, but all you get is a 5 second cutscene. They should have put a little more work into it.  Like I said, I had some fun, but so many of the levels are simple to the point of boring. I was ready for it to be over by the last chapter. If you're curious, I'd say pick it up on sale unless you treat games like movies where you spend $10 for 2.5 hours of entertainment. Then you might be ok paying full price, but I wouldn't be.

First of all, the characters in the story all fit one stereotype or another, and they never change their personalities in the game. Ever. So that's bare bones.

As you progress through the levels, a smooth voice will narrate what Thomas' thoughts and surroundings are, giving a relaxing feel of someone just roaming about, guided by a sense of curiosity. Gradually, you'll meet (and be able to play as) many different characters, all personified with names.  It is the interactions of these shapes, told solely through the narrator, that gives this game heart. Who'd have thought that you could be rapt in the interactions of such simple quadrilateral and monochromaric shapes? They all seem to represent a different mental state; Thomas, the optimistic observer; John, the love-struck grump; and Laura, the cautious outsider, to name a few.  It's also pretty funny at times, with humour that sometimes breaks the fourth wall.  Soundtracks are incredibly important to me, as a great one can ensure you're fully immersed in the game, putting in as much emotional investment as you can. Gladly, Thomas Was Alone perfectly captures an environment that ranges from the serene, to the fast-paced. Apt music at every stage.  For the completionist, there's also additional challenges, mostly involving reaching difficult places, that can squeeze a bit of replayability out of you. Unfortunately, once you've had one play-through, there's not much else cause to boot it up again.

Sure, the point is to use your characters to solve platforming puzzles, but the real key here is the way the story is presented. Every single character has a recognizable personality that you will recognize in somebody you know. The ensemble cast in this game leap out of their minimalist 2D confines to become something so real you can almost touch them.  The soundtrack and voiceover is what really sets this game apart. The video game aspect is almost inconsequential, but it does its part to fill in the necessary gaps within the rather minimal narrative of the story. This is a game of mood and emotion, rather than challenge and action.",

Only 3 buttons, a calming soundtrack and a lovely voiced narrator leads to a wonderful experience that makes you think and makes you really want to continue the story. Some of the jumping puzzles are difficult (as someone who is horrible at jumping puzzles), but the game doesn't punish you for how many times you die or fall or how long it takes you to complete a level. This game is a fantastic, calming experience and it feels like the game is taking you gently by the hand and telling you how to do something new and then going off and watching you from afar, smiling as you jump and fall your way though the story.   All in all, buy this game. Buy it. If you can't, save money until you can, buy it and play it. It's amazing.",

            "review_text": "One of the few times a game has actually made me care about a rectangle...or rather several rectangles. Thomas Was Alone is a very simplistic looking game...until you start to play it.   Pros: -Gameplay: In short, it is a puzzle, platformer, but with an interesting mechanic. Each different square or rectangle is given its own jump ability...or lack thereof in the case of Chris. And some can float on water. No two squares/rectangles are the same and you'll be utilizing them in different ways to solve the puzzle and move on to the next room. It can be a little frustrating at times or a little tricky, but the payoff is a sense of accomplishement and more of the story. The game is always evolving, throwing in new game mechanics, but none are particularly hard to learn. (The upside one can be a little tricky.)  -Voice over: While there are many different characters within the game, there is only one voice actor: the narrator, kind of like Bastion. But this guy doesn't have the cool, slick voice that the guy from Bastion does. Instead, it's a soothing, British accent. (I'm bad at figuring out which accent is which.) He sounds a bit like a calm Wheatley.  -Puzzles: They are entertaining and (at times) a bit challening. The game goes easy on you when you get a new game mechanic and then slowly ramps up the difficulty with that game mechanic.  -Story: It is a simple one about a bunch of A.I.s (and well...I'll let you find out the rest) that unfolds as you go. While it is simple, it's certainly is entertaining and well presented.   Cons:  -Game is a little too short. You could probably get through it in an afternoon. -Can be a bit frustrating at times. (Might be a good thing, depending on the player.)  I would definietly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle games and/or platformers, but I would pick it up either in a bundle (which is how I got it) or on sale.",

            "review_text": "Overview: Keep in mind that this is an indie game, so it's not quite designed to bring you the same experience as AAA titles. What I like about indie games in general is that they usually require a small sense of imagination, something that games lack in this era, but that they didn't 10 years ago...  Story: 8/10 The story is what drives this game. The nearer I was toward the end, the more I could feel that sweet Just-One-More-Level Syndrome, just because of how the story is paced. It is also quite ambiguous and philosophical, so I can't be one to judge how well written it is, simply because it should be open for everyone to decide on their own. You play as Thomas and his friends, computer programs that started to pose the most basic questions anyone would ask themselves: 'Why are we here?'. You join in them in their pursuit of knowledge of their surroundings, with a new character appearing every act or so. They each have different personalities and across the levels, they're split up in almost every single combination imaginable between levels. The glue that holds everything together is the narrator, who is expertly voiced in my opinion, simultaneously the only voice heard during the game.  Graphics: 7/10 This is an indie game, it's not supposed to be flashy. Still, while all the water and steam effects are well handled, the game is simple, just as it should be. Still, i think this game could use some more edge curving in the graphics options. Maybe a few more different particle effects.... But, since this is a very artistic game, the one to judge should be the player.  Sound: 8/10 None of the music felt redundant. None at all. For that, the game earns major respect. I can see how much time went into the pacing of this game. The sound effects though are a different matter, I must admit that I was starting to dislike the jump sound for the characters near the end of the game, especially since this is, after all, a platformer, which brings me to the final and most important part of a game:  Gameplay: 7/10 I am a fan of platformers, so I'm not easily tired by them. So as a veteran of the genre, I got to say that this is an extremely easy addition to it. The penalty for dying as any character in a level is simply going back to the last checkpoint, but the game only managed to kill me off in, at most, around 15 levels, levels usually designed from a 'learn from your mistakes' basis. Still, it's also kind of what makes the experience enjoyable, since it's practically a breeze. It lets you focus on the story thanks to that. I guess it just isn't supposed to be a challenging game, like platformers such as Super Meat Boy or Rayman.  Conclusion 7/10 Very enjoyable. If you got this off a Humble Bundle, it is worth the whole bundle. Still, to be completely honest, I think 8 euros on the steam store is just too much. That is my opinion, and it is final because I've finished the game. Still, I've enjoyed every minute in this game (except maybe that one level with those small platforms overthe water), and i recommend it to anyone, since it is unique and doesnt require pro gaming skills.  --Xaelroth",

        {
            "review_text": "OK, just got 100% on this game and I'll review on five criteria. Gameplay, Plot, Sound, Graphics, and Content.  Gameplay: This game plays like a standard 2D platformer. There are 7 characters you'll be playing as, and they each have different ability. Everyone has a different jump height (The jump in this game is excellent,) and some have special powers such as double jumping or being stuck upside down. However, there are few levels where you play as one character. Almost every level has multiple squares at a time, and you must use the different jumps and powers of each character to get across to the portal which takes you to the next level.  However, these puzzles are cool, but after you figure them out, it takes a long time to physically complete them. The gameplay really suffers from this, as it often has you wishing the squares would move faster. That isn't to say the gameplay isn't good, but this hurts the pace in a lot of ways.  7/10.  Plot: I'll try to make this as spoiler free as possible, but here goes. Thomas is spontaniously generated, and gradually learns how to navigate his environment. He learns how to fall and jump. Eventually, he meets Chris. Chris is smaller, orange and has a weaker jump compared to Thomas. He despises Thomas at first, but they have to work together to get through the place.  Eventually more and more characters are added to the mix, each and every one having tons of backstory, and character. Another thing this game does amazingly is character development. You grow bonds to each character, and the ending was enough to make me cry over these squares jumping from space to space. All because the development of each one is fantastic. Plot is definitely the biggest strength of this game.  10/10  Sound: The whole game has music from David Housden playing in the background. This music is fantastic, but it gets better in the second half of the game. In the first half, the music is rather repetitive. The best part of the whole game though, in my opinion, is the narration. Narrated by Danny Wallace, the narration will make you cry, laugh, and everything in between. It also helps that his voice is amazing.  9/10  Graphics: The graphics are remarkable. Not because they're amazing, but because they push this game to something totally different. While the characters are just squares, and the terrain is black, the background is full of neat colors and always has motion in it. If this game had flat, boring backgrounds, I can safely say I'd like it a lot less. Also, I feel the characters being blocks was the best way to go. As proved by games like Minecraft and Terraria, low graphics are sometimes beautiful.  8/10  Content: This isn't a long game. There are about 100 levels in the main story, but I still completed it in 4 hours. However, there is another, much smaller story arc that tells the tale of a square named Benjamin. This takes place long before the events of the main story.  The achievements don't provide much either. With an even slightly keen eye, you'll get them all in one playthrough like myself. Half of them are even unmissable if you beat the game.  7/10  Overall score: 41/50. This game isn't perfect. The gameplay has some slight annoyances and it isn't very long, but the charm is the prime factor here. The plot is the best I've ever seen in a video game, and the overall feel of the game is GORGEOUS. This game is well worth the 10 dollar price tag, and I recommend it to everybody.",

The melancholic soundtrack really underpins that sense, as well; a really nice blend of squelchy chiptune/SID with a piano melody.  Puzzle-challenge-wise, the puzzles are typically exploiting the interactions among the characters, and most of the puzzles require switching back and forth between the characters.

All details of the characters and plot are told by a relaxing British narrator, the kind you may have already encountered in LittleBigPlanet, or The Stanley Parable. Not only is he a good storyteller and pleasant to listen to, he's funny on occasion, as well.  The characterization given to these rectangles is varied, well-defined, and quite interesting. Their story, though not overly complicated at first, really draws you in by the end, with some good twists and turns. For a bunch of colored quadrilaterals, these guys have quite a journey. The best part is that the gameplay always reflects these shifts in plot (and vice versa) in fitting ways.

It's a bit like they came up with all these good ideas about plot and visual design but then left the actual level planning and game design down to the last and failed to spend enough time building challenging levels / puzzles. The Benjamin DLC is far more challenging but only as a platformer / coordination challenge, than an actual puzzle challenge. Recommended 4/5",

Thomas was alone is a great example of minimalism and storytelling. It uses the excellent and very British voiceacting and narration to draw you into the events going on. It's almost like a storybook, but read out against a background of something significantly greater going on.  Yeah, I've got niggles about it. At a lot of points the direction the story was going actually kind of aggravated me, but taking a step back the fact that I was invested enough to get aggravated is a point in its favor. At times, the game slowed down a bit, it doesn't seem to be terribly well optimised. And the sheer perilousness of the extra levels, while standard for bonus levels, clashed a bit with the game's overall tone.  That said, Thomas Was Alone is one of those game's that's an experience. An exercise in representation and character with solid core gameplay that is enough to keep it fun and worthy of being a game instead of just an audiobook. It's not the biggest buy you'll find on here, but if it goes on sale I'd say it's totally worth a look.",

STORY:  Many cite the story as the strongest point in this game. I agree fully; however, the ending was very dissapointing. This story went on far longer than it should have all for some sort of epilogue that really didn't add to anything except wasting 30 minutes of your time. The game could have ended in a good cliffhanger however, it kept going and ended in a cliffhanger anyways. But it was a very bad ending.  GAMEPLAY:  Conceptually, this game was insanely creative and tossed in so many beatufil mechanics that could have worked so well together. Sadly, the execution was quite lacking. Although some levels were quite nicely designed, most of them were 'get from point A to point B' except 5 times because you have to do it for each character. At some point, the game forgot about the puzzles and didn't properly make use of the great mechanics. Many of the levells towards the end of the game felt less designed and mostly just felt like a chore rather than a game.",

You use different characters and their abilities to complete puzzles and physical challenges in order to make it to the next level/world. The gameplay mechanics are extremely smooth and very simple to operate. I find that a lot of the time; platformers are very difficult to play on a computer, due to the keyboard being awkward for one's hands. I have to admit I did have to take some breaks for my hands during playing this game, overall I haven't much to complain about.  The story is absolutely adorable, and the narrator really brings the story to life. How he portrays each character is a lot of fun to watch and a lot of fun to listen to.

Thomas reminded me a lot of portal strangely enough, with the difficulty level going up as the game progresses by adding new elements to the puzzles usually in the shape of a new character to control that has a different ability that'll help the party to the end goal.  While the game is happily plodding along you're also subject to a brilliant narrative with some of the best characterisation I have seen in video games. Yes the Characters are only colored squares and rectangles but the story plays up to that so well. Music is top notch as is the general aesthetic of the visuals.

The platforming-focused levels can occasionally be frustrating with head-bumping and distant checkpoints.

He (and the excellent writing) will make you actually care about featureless rectangles and believe they have feelings and unique personalities, even though they never say or do anything themselves. As you move them around the levels solving puzzles, he describes their thoughs, hopes, and dreams, and you become invested in them.

Abilities are pretty much like how high one can jump and then their size/shape and such. There's some blocks with super powers, but I'm afraid I'd spoil it if I gave more.

After saying that I should mention that I don't play many platformers as it is, but still--this game is stellar.   The gameplay is about as basic as it gets. You control Thomas and other diversely shaped blocks you pick up along the way. Each block has their own name, personality and serves a specific function. None of these blocks are expendable. Not only because they're vital to many of the puzzles in the game, but because the narrator names them and tells their story when we meet them. It's mind-boggling to me, how Thomas Was Alone got me attached to a bunch of squares and rectangles. Each shape has their own little story to be told, and the narrator is more than willing to do the talking. It's adorable, really, as you hear the narrator talk of these shapes as if they're people with fleshed out personalities and quirks--exactly how you see them by the end of the game.   The plot of Thomas Was Alone is much more intricate than you may think. This game tells an interesting story that's driven by the characters (the shapes) and their curiosity. By the end of the game you will have grown attached to each of these characters and their mini story arcs. These shapes change, and it's not shown in anything but the dialogue of the narrator, and the steps the player takes to completing the game. There's not much else I can say as the game is so simplistic in nature. All I can do is urge you to Thomas Was Alone if you love a good story or you enjoy a solid platformer. Totally worth the cost.",

Surprisingly, quite enough. As do all the other characters in the game. A big part of that emotion comes from the smart voice-over, fleshing out a plot and character connections that would simply be lost without it. But the other crucial element, and the reason TWA is so effective, is contextual meaning from which it achieves a suspenseful buildup towards a metaphysical resolution.   Scratch that, I'm making the game sound way more pompous than it really is. This is a smart puzzle platformer with great art direction (your eyes will love the contrasts created by light, shadows and colors). It's not taxing, it's actually very relaxing and you'll just want to know what happens next. And you will care for the fates of these little simple shapes.

The variability with the portal locations and the shape mechanics creates interesting and challenging puzzles.  Did I mention the narrator? Other than quotes shown at the beginning of each chapter that explain a major AI malfunction, he's responsible for progressing the story. And he's wonderful. He shares the shapes' thoughts as they meet each other, judge each other, fall in love, pretend to be superheroes, and everything in between. These shapes have better character development than I've seen in AAA games.  I do have a few quibbles. Alternating between the shapes isn't consistent.
