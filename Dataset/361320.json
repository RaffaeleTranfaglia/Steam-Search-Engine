            "review_text": " Upgrading my review from a sideways thumb to an up thumb because reasons.    **Update** [They just added a bit of extra content free of charge! hurray! Also, when I first posted this, I didn't realize the game is actually pretty old and runs well considering its age. Well done!]  I just lost a couple of hours playing this game without realizing it. It's a good time waster, though I feel like a $2.50 price tag would easily get a lot more sales.   Pros:  After you muddle through the awkward sort of tutorial and get the hang of things, it's actually really fun!  Your bouncers actually do beat people to death.  I liked competing against other casinos.  Worth the $5 if they would clean up the bugs and add more features.  Cons:  A little pricey for what it delivers.   Slow and clunky feeling while learning. Feels frustrating at first.  Buggy when trying to get the bouncers/guards to take action.  Employee unhappiness is a little overtuned. Their happiness decays a bit too quickly for my tastes and doesn't seem to make any sense. They'll be making twice what the minimum for their position is and still ready to quit.  Changing screen resolution doesn't do anything, so everything looks huge and it gets frustrating because I'm constantly looking for better zoom out capability than what is provided.",

It is hard to believe that the devs didn't at least play this on windows 7 to see that it crashed every 10 min or less. Looking like a money grab from yet another dev.",
