There are different types of heroes such as Barbarian, magic dude and Archer. There is 1 pre-unlocked power and 2 specials. There are item shops, levelling up and more. So what can i say? Its good.    Pros   Good Atmosphere Great Magic System (Potions) Boss Battle?! Different Dungeons Challenging    Cons   Hardcore Graphic issues occasionally  9/10",

Some of the bosses and areas don't feel very polished or bug out and the Necromancer character is extremely overpowered. Overall it's a 7/10",

            "review_text": "DS is not fun to play. In early access, your toon moved very quickly and it was very exciting to decimate packs of mobs. Now....you move like a tortoise. I put every one of my leveling points into movement speed just to move slightly faster. Playing with a controller is also not fun. You have to jam the right stick all the way in certain directions to face that direction and if you play a melee class, its just...unbearable. Melee has always been gimped in DS. The dev tried to rectify this by making them be meat shields. Basically they could absorb a bunch of damage becuase they had to. Every mob in this game can pretty much hit you while you're a melee class. You have to constantly been edging back and forth so you don't always get hit but it happens quite frequently. I would say, just play archer or any range class. However, with the nerf to movement speed, even those classes aren't fun.",
