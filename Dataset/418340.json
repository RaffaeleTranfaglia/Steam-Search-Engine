            "review_text": "I personally am a huge RWBY fan. Which is why I want this game to be great and it is to some extent. However there are some major flaws. Im going to be as constructive as I can with my criticism. PLEASE ANYONE FROM THE GRIMM ECLIPSE TEAM THAT IS READING THIS I IMPLORE YOU TO READ IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION. Anyone who has read the recent reviews see the backlash they are recieving from their recent updates. It seems at the start everyone loved it but now some people still really enjoy it while others have completely flipped their opinion. I like to say I'm somewhere in the middle. So starting with the things they need to improve or rather reimprove. (There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said a million times but it needs to be said a million more untill they fix it. * The face models- This is probably the biggest thing. I don't want to say that it ruins the game but its pretty bad.  * The overall detail of the characters- This goes hand in hand with the face models. I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING THE CHARACTERS TO LOOK AS MUCH LIKE THE SHOW AS POSSIBLE. If your take one thing from this review take what I just said (caps).   *Grimm are damage sponges- DId grimm recieve aura all of sudden? Its so important in Hack n Slash games to not have damage sponges unless they are mini bosses or actual bosses. If you want to make it more difiicult simply add more grimm.   *Improve the ability trees- The ability trees are far too barebones and some abilites aren't even worth getting. The more unique and diverse abilities you can add the more playstyles there will be.   Now for the things you can add to the game.  * Character interaction (IMPORTANT)- This is will definitely add to the story and replay value. Make the members of RWBY react to one another. For example, Yang makes a pun all members should have a reaction but they shouldn't all use it at once. For example in my example, Yang says her pun Weiss and Blake react to it and then Yang could even counter react to their receptions of the pun. However the next time you go through this level. Yang makes the same pun and only Ruby reacts to it. The next time you go through it nobody reacts to it since you're running a full team of Yangs. You see, it makes each playthrough unique. The longer the team can hold conversations with each other the more immersed you'll get into to it and the less it will feel like the same predetermined remarks. Sorry this one was so long its just really important.  * Bosses- I think it would be really cool to see Torchwich, Cinder, etc cameo as bosses or if you want to make some new villians for the game that would be cool too. I just dont want to fight a giant mindless grimm for every boss.  *Different enemy factions- I know its called grimm eclipse but maybe you could add in the white fang or again make a new faction of enemies that could call alongside the new villians.  *Misc- As much as I love fighting it would be cool to see Beacon as level even if its just for a bit. For this Beacon level the fighting part could be team RWBY going up agiant team CRDl in a sparring match. THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. Also of course lets get some more playable character and/or cameos from some of the other teams.  Thats about it. It took me forever to write this which I hope shows you how much a care about this game. If you guys truly want to listen to the community and make the best RWBY game you can like you say you do than implement some, hopefully all of these changes. I think the RWBY communtiy can agree with me on most all of things I said. I know it must be hard making this game from the ground up. I hope this helps.    EDIT: The game released and not much was changed. Putting aside my rwby bias and juding the game alone I found it quite underwhelming. However, I'd still recommend it to any rwby fan just to kill a few hours but to people who are not rwby fans I would not recommend picking it up.",

            "review_text": "While fans of the show will have a lot of fun with the fanservice of playing as RWBY Team in their exploits against the Grimm, RWBY: Grimm Eclipse suffers from some poor game design. Levels are pedestrian, having you run from point A to point B and battling in flat landscapes, though none of the levels you get to go through are even remotely as interesting as the eyecatching vistas blocked by invisible walls in the background. The few levels there are are very short, about fifteen to twenty minutes a piece. Which is fine, but a majority of that time is taken up by obligatory survival waves, which take about... 5-7 minutes (with ore than one survival encounter, it's essentially half the level), which begs the quesion of why the environments are so empty.  While it should be mentioned that the game is surprisingly tough (in a four player co-op hack and slash, it's generally almost impossible to die, yet I managed to do so anyhow), and the combat feels hard-hitting, the actual combat system is weak, consisting of pressing Weak Attack a number of times before finishing with a single Strong Attack (it's a Warriors/Musou title without the 'strategic' fluff, which I supoose is actually an improvement). Charged ranged atttacks are oddly part of a 'combo' of pressing the Fire button three times, and not as a result of charging your attacks, and curiously Ruby and Blake share the same movesets, as do Yang and Weiss, despite having different animations. To say noting of of the performance issues and gamebreaking bugs despite the small scope.  Maybe a lot will change, but I don't believe so. Buy only if you're a fan of the show.",

The story was... alright I guess. Really short without going into depth, only way to understand this story is to listen to a bunch of phone calls.  Fights are pretty repetetive, run around and kill the grimm/robots, defend this place. The combat itself however is alright, each character are very similar though needs more differences to give a bigger variety of fighting styles (my opinion).  On the good side though, soundtrack from the original series, nice to listen to while playing. Actual voice actors of the characters from the series. Many other good and bad things, but I won't go through all of them. To sum it all up though...  Can't recommend this game at this point in time, too little content for a lot of money, not worth it so far. Honestly I really do hope that the game stayed in Early Access, the game seems a little unfinished with some glitches.  Here's hoping for the future of this game, I have faith in Roosterteeth.",

            "review_text": "This is going to be a very long post so if you don't feel like sitting there and reading all of this because i know its a lot so scroll to the bottom for a TL:DR, Now these are my personal opinons so i dont expect everyone to agree with me. I just feel I needed to post ths to finally talk about this game and to warn future buyers.  Rwby: Grim Eclipse a game that I have been playing since the initial release. I had such high hopes for the game but after the' Forever Fall' update and the whole models fiasco i started to lose faith in RT Games. With the 'Butter and Butter' I was starting to gain some of that lost faith back. That was until they stated that the game was going to be released out of early access so soon and that's where i had lost all faith. This game was not complete by any stretch of the imagination and im going to explain why I think that and why I wont be recomending this game  Story The story is fine it's nothing special but at the end of the day it gets the job done it drives you forward wanting to know whats going on with Merlot. Honestly when they had originally said that they were working with the writter's of Rwby the animated series and the fact that the show would be cannon to the volumes I was hoping it would be something more worthwhile.  Gameplay Now when the game was in EA I thought that the combat was fine I had actually enjoyed a lot of what they had added after the 'Combat Revision' update and like many others I thought it was a step in the right direction. But thats just it. it was only a step in the right direction. I was hoping that by the final release it would have been fully expanded upon and not just 'tweaked'. At the end of the day im very dissapointed with the combat system as it is not. Im not asking for it to be as in-depth as say a Devil May Cry game but at the very least expended upon with a few more combos and maybe one other alternate ultimate that maybe uses the characters semblance in some way.   Also when I heard that we were getting persistant character leveling I was hoping that the levels would increase but it didn't it satyed at level 10 which seemed like a bad idea to me i was originaly hoping that it would go up to say 20 levels. And with the level increase and the persistant levels I had hoped that the skill tree would see either a change or a re work. Sadly it got neither (from what I was able to tell). I was hoping that with persistant levels it would have been the perfect time to change the skill tree but that never happened and in my opinion it feels lazy. I would have liked to see a new skill tree where at level one you dont have much in terms of combos or abilities and as you level you unlock new combos and new ultimates and passive effects (Ex aura increase abilities and medic skill). The way the skill tree is right now is you either give up more offensive abilites for defensive and vise versa. Im sire that may have been the way it was intended originaly when the game had more MOBA elements but not itjust doesn't fit. I feel you would get a better feel of progression like this.  The new rank system was something that I was looking forward to until I found that when you rank up it resets everything. All the challenges and even stroy progress from what I heard. I wouldn't know because I chose not to rank up because I dont want to grind endlessly to get everything again. Good idea horibly executed.  Graphics Now the graphics I feel are good for the most part the backgrounds and levels are beautiful (especially Forever Fall). The character models were a point of topic that for a long time angred me but at this point I no longer care that the models have changed. They were changed and it was explicitly said that we would not be geting the old models back. But I tought to myself if these models could be made to look as good as the original by the time the game released i would have no problem with it. But unfortunatly they are not better the the original's. They are for sure much better the the absolutly awful 'FF' models but the fact is this is the full release I expect them to either be as good or better than the models we had from the very start. My main issue with them now is that they just dont seems a detailed as the originals. If you add in the rest of the detail fix some of the faces a little more (Yang's is fine) then I will have no issues with them. The new UI is great a huge improvment no real flaws there.  Sound&amp;Music Now the muic for is all used form the show which im sure no one would blame you, the muisc in the show is amazing and its amazing here. I goes to show that with the right music it can make something feel so much better and there were times when the music was pumping and I was kicking butt that I felt like a BADASS. My only issue is that some tracks (sacrifice) tend to repeat all to often.  The sounds for the game are for the most part pretty good. My only issue is that closer to the end of the story I find the SFX seem to be quite low. It could either be me or a bug not to sure.  My Overall Thoughts Now while I must say that I do enjoy this game (mostly for the love of the show) I do feel that RT Games has really dropped the ball on this game. They started the EA development off so strong, comunicating with the fans, allowing opt in betas, telling us what was coming up and their plans for the future. But it all went down hill after the 'FF' update. comunication got worse the fans felt like they were being ignored and just in general were not happy they way develpment was going. Once the game was set for a realease I knew that this game was not going to be the RWBY game I was hoping for. When all is said and done this game just feels so lazy, and I hate to say it but with the game sorely lacking content the fact that the developer's want to charge money for team JNPR is crazy. Do you not understand that when you release a game with so little content and then you want to charge for something that should have been in the game it makes you seem so greedy and so money hungry. Its not that im aganst paid DLC I just feel JNPR should be free anything after that can be paid for all I care. I have been trying to have faith in you but its mostly gone. My friend who bought this with me at the same time would always say 'They are going to ♥♥♥♥ it up' and you know what I guess he was right. I hate to come off as and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but this is the way I feel and I know im not alone on this. I was hoping for maybe more taunts and I really wanted there to be skins for the game. the alt outfits from volume 2 would have been perfect. Something that you could have done with the skins that would have surprised everyone was add in the new Volume 4 re dessigns as unlockables. Having those would have been amazing but at the end of the day all you gave us was a bare minimum game. It makes me so sad that I feel I need to give this game ♥♥♥♥ and a thumbs down bucause of how bug a fan I am of RWBY, but i feel like I wouldn't be a true fan if I didn't express my reasons of why I feel the way I do about this game. At the end of the day I do still enjoy the game and will continue to play, I could go on about the other things that ♥♥♥♥ me off but i'll chose to end my thoughts here.  TL:DR I feel the game was released way to early and the game just feels lazy and the game is already getting paid DLC that it does not deserve. Tha game is not worth the price tag so if you not a fan of RWBY you probably wont enjoy this game and even if you are a fan the low amount of content may have you feeling buyers remorse after just a few hours.",

I saw it as my future favorite game on steam. Yet when they changed the character models WITHOUT any option to use the better looking ones, that 'favorite game' I saw was going downhill. The all-to-sudden announcement of 'full release' worried a great amount of people and with good reason. It feels exactly the same as when it was in early access.  Levels are still very repetitive, while there is some veriety to enemies, it's still point A to B, kill some enemies here or there, survive some waves to proceed and survive waves while defending. While I like the basic feel of comboing in the game, every character has one combo that works so much better than others, which adds to the repetitiveness.   TL;DR The game is basically still in early access, it's very repetitive with a total of maybe 3 hours of content overall. I can't recommend this game in it's current state. Nor will I play it again until further notice. Probably the only thing I'm happy about is that I got it for $5 while it was on sale during early access.   AND WHERE THE F*** IS TEAM JNPR?!",

            "review_text": "If you just want to know if you should buy this game, I'll make it easy for you. DON'T. If you want to know why, keep reading. You'll get more reasons not to buy RWBY: Grimm Eclipse than you (or, frankly, anyone) needs.  For this review, I will present all of the flaws I found with RWBY: Grimm Eclipse in a list format. If you're planning on reading this all the way through, you might want to use the bathroom first. You'll be here awhile.  -Some of the possible attacks are irrelevant. Ruby's Light+Heavy combo is a perfect example. The Light+Light+Heavy combo does more damage, has about the same range, and doesn't take much longer to execute. Blake's Light+Heavy combo has some use, but only as a quick travel mechanism (combining this combo with Dodge allows you to skate across the map at absurd velocity), so it too is largely irrelevant to combat, and Yang's Light+Heavy combo has no real purpose.  -Weiss' melee attacks are strictly worse than her ranged attack with just one upgrade. A single cycle of her ranged attack (2 normal+1 special) can kill a Creep when her melee combos can't.  -Part of the reason for Weiss' reduced damage is her ability to freeze her enemies with a Light+Light+Heavy combo, but this isn't that good. Creeps aren't worth the time to freeze, Ursai, Borbatusks, and Mutant Beowolves appear to be immune to freezing, and Weiss can't really do much to enemies once she freezes them.  -Using light attacks on their own is just pathetic, and there's no reason not to use a combo instead of a normal attack. This is irritating, to say the least.  -Yang's shotguns are just... bad. Since they have such a wide spread and low effective range, they're really only good as crowd control, and they don't have the damage to do so, and even if they did, having your crowd control tactic interrupted by missiles that aren't much deadlier than Nerf darts makes it pretty ineffective.  -Some of the best features of previous versions of the game are gone. While bullet management was somewhat frustrating in the first build, having to time your reloading was an interesting challenge. I'd personally recommend that the developers take a page out of Overwatch's book- infinite magazines, finite magazine size. This would keep the tempo element of bullet management without the 'Minecraft Survival Mode' element.  -Another thing that appears to be missing is blast attacks. These were actually interesting, as they were a combo that wasn't just a variation of 'mash LMB some number of times, then hit RMB', and the mix of melee and ranged combat is one of the things that made RWBY's fight scenes so entertaining to watch.  -The developers removed the option to do most of the special attacks from the original Early Access version on their own, instead making the ones that weren't area-of-effect into team attacks and 'every-third-ranged-attack' attacks. True, the area-of-effect attacks were just better than the other special attacks for the most part, but this wasn't always the case. If you look at gameplay footage of the original game (back when it was called 'RWBY: Grim Eclipse) you see Buster Shot and Whirlwind used just as much, if not more, than Crescendo. Instead of taking away the other options, why not balance all of them out to relatively equal power level instead?  -Enemies feel boring to fight. Creeps are somewhat interesting due to their ability to burrow underground and attack you from below... the first time you see them. Beowolves feel way too inert, Ursai have the ability to slam you with a boulder at range that there appears to be NO WAY TO EVADE OR COUNTER, some of the more interesting Grimm (Nevermores, King Taijitu, Griffons) are noticeably absent, and Grimm are either far too easy to kill or impossible to defend against.  -The robots could have been fun to fight as elite, more difficult foes. Perhaps special sequences of moves could get past their guard, much like with the Brawlers in One Finger Death Punch. Perhaps they could have weak points to attack, like the Colossi in Shadow of the Colossus. (I find myself alluding to a lot of better games while writing this.) Instead, they can't be defended against effectively, attack quickly enough to disrupt most combo moves, and don't offer any opportunities for moves other than 'do the same one or two combos you've used for the entire game' if you don't feel like shooting them with stunning ranged attacks... over.... and over... and over....  -Countermoves and team attacks are inconsistent. It's never really well-explained how you get the opportunity to do either, and sometimes, they JUST DON'T WORK.  -Taunts are cool, but giving them any purpose in combat at all would have been nice.  -Some form of voice chat would have been a nice feature. Part of the little fun this game provides is getting to work as a team, which requires quick communication in the heat of battle, something that is highly difficult to achieve with a text-only communication system.  -Hearing the same four or five voice lines a dozen times is a kind of torture that would make a medieval Inquisitor proud. The lines aren't even that good. They read like caricatures of Team RWBY were speaking them, they're virtually interchangable, so if you've heard one of Weiss' lines, you don't really need to hear the others, and the lines show no interaction between the Huntresses. A friend of mine had the idea for 'multi-character gestures', which would work like the gestures in Portal 2's cooperative campaign, and which would add some of the personality that makes RWBY such a great show into the game that besmirches the series' name.  -Ozpin's lines are horribly written. He feels utterly devoid of personality.  -Dr. Merlot is a caricature who doesn't interest me at all. When you encounter a great villain in a story, you hate them but also understand why they're doing what they're doing and maybe even feel a little guilty empathy. When you encounter a good villain, you hate them for all the right reasons. Dr. Merlot is neither a great villain nor a good one. He's simply another iteration of the 'Mad Scientist' stereotype, and his lines aren't that good either. NO ONE IN ANY STORY WHATSOEVER SHOULD SAY 'superhighway of scientific progress' OR 'you should be getting eaten alive right now' UNLESS IT IS IN A PARODY OF SUCH TERRIBLE WRITING.  -The plot makes no sense. Why is Dr. Merlot sabotaging 'Control Centers'? Why is he releasing mutated Grimm into the wild? Why would he destroy his lab just because his Mutant Deathstalker was killed? What in blazes is this mysterious 'serum', anyway? None of these questions are ever answered, and the game provides no motivation for the main characters other than 'one of the professors told me to'.  -There really isn't much replay value. The game is mostly the same every time you play, and the incentives to return (challenges that unlock new abilities, like the better versions of the Ultimate attacks, and Hunter Rank) are as grindy and unsatisfying as the first playthrough.  -$25 is far too much to charge for a game that doesn't even feel finished. I'd rather get the first version, which is essentially 'Red Trailer: The Game', for $25 than this shambling disappointment.  There are probably at least a dozen more problems with the game that I didn't cover here, but I think this covers most of the major flaws of RWBY: Grimm Eclipse.",

The music is good but most is just songs from the show, nothing wrong with that, however when they loop the first 45 seconds from a song over and over including the song fading out and in every time it just hurts the ears.  My stopping point was at the final fight of the current story against the boss, after getting instantly killed by attacks you cant see, having minor enemies constanly respawing during the fight, having the boss invincible for 90% of the fight, and the looping music I couldnt take it anymore.

            "review_text": "RWBY has been one of my favourite shows for a while, so I was pretty excited to see a video game come out of it. I bought the early access version and played a few hours, and actually reccomended it to some friends. Now I feel like I owe them their money back.  The gameplay is boring and repetitive, with only a few combos you can do per character, and the gun feature feels severly lacking as well. The campaign is boring and the ranking does not feel as though you accomplished much, as all the enemy types are ostensively the same but with more or less health. The only vaguely interesting parts is in the dust mines with the enhanced beowulves, but even that is slow and unsteady.  Another thing worth noting is how easily you can tatke advantage of the enemies in the game. As of writing this review, the gun basically stuns enemies after a few hits and most enemies can be taken down with the same combo repeated over and over.  Lastly, there are the graphics and speed. Now I don't run a monster gaming computer, but my PC is no slouch, as it is well above average in specs. With that said, there wer times when I tried to load into a pre-existing game and the game just set me down somewhere and nothing moved. The amount of times it did something like this makes me feel thta the developers just didn't feel like saving their dignity and adding in an error message. The graphics are normally fine, the shading looks nice, the environments are just so boring. Foreverfall is pretty and all, but it's literally all red and gray. I forget what the very first area is called, but all that is is green and gray. I might understand it if they wanted the enemies to obviously stick out of the environment, but then later on you fight red soldiers on a red backdrop. This kind of failed colour coordination hurts me. The idea to convey something not belonging in an environment through colour is a theme that needs to be followed very poiniantly, which it is not. Also of note, some camera angles make certain models disappear. It may be random, or a specific trigger.  Also, I forgot to mention that they had promised team juniper for a long time, which is why I kept playing, but with it being paid dlc for a game that isn't very good to begin with? I don't think so.  Overall, i would give this game a 2 out of 5 stars, if only for the fact that they seemed to put at least some effort into the graphics and there are less glitches than in the early access version.",

The good news is that the playable characters are now much closer to their original appearance; that is to say, team RWBY actually look like team RWBY now. They're just a hair away from being back to their original 1:1 to the show, so there's that. The faces are vastly improved from the god-awful Forever Fall update models.  Speaking of Forever Fall, those levels are buggy as all hell. I've got an above-average computer; I play most games on their highest settings with steady fps, so the fact that Forever Fall stutters pretty noticeably makes me think it's the game and not my comp. But whatever, it's playable. Ugly and un-fun, but playable.  Weiss is my favorite in-game and in-show, so I'm also glad they removed a lot of her stupid 'grunting' sounds she used to make while attacking. It was dumb, but it's gone now.   The combat is okay, gameplay overall is rather bland and very, very repetitive. I will say that it's pretty fun to play this along with loud music while you're intoxicated, so if you're a RWBY fan and you're looking for a game to ♥♥♥♥ away ~2 hours and a blunt with, this is okay. Not great, not even really good, just okay. This is 'meh' material at its most mediocre.  Or it WAS okay, but I wouldn't recommend this at it's current price. I bought it for $15 back in EA, and I've gotten quite a few hours out of it so I don't feel jibbed, but I wouldn't pay $25. Wait for a sale.",

            "review_text": "'Do you recommend this game?' That's an interesting question, Steam. Disclaimer: Huge RWBY fanboy here. Been there, done that, bought the t-shirt. (Literally. Wearing it right now.)  TL;DR: Painfully average third person action game that I want to recommend to everyone, but too tough a sell in its current state at $25. Boring as f*ck solo on lower difficulties, but lots of fun can be had with a good team, and Eclipse mode presents a nice challenge if nobody else is playing. New game mode (horde) coming soon™, will update review then.  I'll say this: I enjoy this game. I bought it within hours of it going up on Early Access, and about 90 hours of my playtime was pre-'release.' I've had fun, I've met some cool people, and I've enjoyed my two-ish-hour spans of pummeling waves of Grimm. Unfortunately, that's about all the game has to offer right now, and it was only ten bucks back then. I'll update this review when I've gotten some time in the always 'coming soon™' Horde mode that is miraculously releasing some time in the next week or so, but as of right this moment? There is simply not enough content here to justify a $25(USD) price tag.    You play as one of the members of team RWBY (all voiced by their actresses from the show), with team JNPR coming soon™ as paid DLC (spoiler alert, I'm buying that as soon as it comes out), as you (and up to three other players if you're lucky or patient enough) hack-and-slash-and-shoot your way through ten extremely linear, but decently lengthy, levels, mowing down waves of ~10 different enemy types that are either extremely easy to kill or extremely easy to get ganked by.   (Lookin' at you, androids.)   If you do play solo, (Protip: don't. Well, once. Achievement. Then don't.) there are difficulty levels allowing you to replicate the increased enemy spawn rate provided by having more players in the game, without the increased fun.   Each level has some objective stuff, mostly wave survival.   Combat is fairly simple, with light attack strings that can be ended early with a heavy attack (of which one or two combos per character are worth even thinking about using).   Your standard heavy attack can be 'charged' to do more damage by holding the relevant button.    You've got a ranged combo that consists of two basic shots and a 'special' on the third shot (which vary from completely worthless (most of them) to absurdly OP (two specifically), with a few not-crap ones).    Heavy attacks and combo finishers can 'set up' an enemy, allowing a teammate (or you, if you're playing solo. Again, don't) to perform a 'team attack,' most of which get the job done when upgraded but suck at first.   After filling your meter by comboing enemies, you can use an 'ultimate,' which is, in all cases, an AoE attack, most of which are good when upgraded but suck at first.   Countering and dodging exist, and work pretty well most of the time. Countering, as well as several skills, will stun enemies, and performing a fully charged heavy attack on a stunned enemy gives a guaranteed team attack setup. Holding the dodge button allows you to run faster, and jump-dodging is faster still most of the time. Dash attack is a thing, and dash&gt;heavy does the same heavy as light&gt;heavy.   You earn XP by killing stuff or assisting kills, doing or setting up team attacks, and doing objective-related stuff. You can also find 25XP orbs in crates and vases, and there are 'hidden' artifacts on the maps that give 100XP. Max level is 10, each level gives you a skill point, except lv10, which gives two. Some upgrades cost one point, some cost two, none cost more than two.  And that's about it. For about two and a half hours a run, for as many runs as it takes for you to get bored. You unlock upgrades for your skills by killing stuff, and you complete challenges (i.e. grind a lot) to 'rank up.' This resets all of the skills you've unlocked, resets your characters' levels, and gives you a shiny badge next to your name and a fresh set of challenges. Once you reach rank ten, you unlock... an achievement. Woo f*ckin' hoo. On the technical side, the game runs pretty well. Even has a 'Potato' graphics preset for those of you who didn't spend four figures on your rig. Runs decent on medium on my fairly old laptop, and stays at 60 admirably on Ultra on my 970. Actual graphics options are almost nonexistent outside of the presets (TotalBiscuit would be very disappointed). Full controller support, but no rebinding for KBM or controller. Not even presets.  As I said at the top, I like the game. If you are a huge RWBY fan like me, you might like it, too. The question is whether you'll like it enough to get your money's worth with what's been presented as the official release version. When it goes back on sale, $10-$15, maybe. Probably. Enough to get an acceptable percentage of the achievements. At $25, it becomes a much tougher sell. Again, update coming when horde drops, soon™, and it might be awesome. But for now, I cannot say that the average third-person action fan browsing the store should buy this in its current state at the current price. I really want to, because there is a lot of potential here, but this still feels too much like an early access game to be 25 bucks. Sorry, RTGames. It's a decent effort from a tiny team, but you really should've considered RTX '17 as your release window. I think this is a safe generalization to make: we RWBY fans prefer perfection to a quick turnaround.  PS. First review! Hopefully the formatting isn't borked, so I don't have to go back and fix it. If you do buy the game, or own it already and stopped by to read the reviews, feel free to add me and we can play, grind, or just have as much fun as the game allows. I've managed nearly 200 hours of it thus far, and still find myself wanting to play. Probably blinded by RWBY Vol. 4 hype, but that's why I put in the disclaimer at the top.",

I tried to play it, but the controls are clunky, the characters are....out of character, there's not enough difference in enemy characters that you fight, and it just was not fun.

            "review_text": "I'm not even really sure how to review this game. I very much want to like it, but I just can't. The combat system is primarily at fault for this. It's some strange combination of dynasty warrior styled multiple opponent combat and arena fighting game. Dynasty warriors works because of the large area of effect that attacks take up, but in this most attacks only target a single opponent, which is only chosen based on the direction your camera is facing and the direction button your pressing. I'm not really even sure which combination of the two targets what opponent. This makes using ranged attacks a chore, and melee unforgiving because it's too difficult to specify that 'yes, I do want to attack that grimm that's attacking me before he gets his attack off' or 'no I want to keep attacking this grim because my combo will move me out of the way anyway.'  There is a counter system, but its use is not effective or fun. When you're fighting multiple opponents that each can attack without regard to the others. This means that you often wind up countering into an attack from a different opponent. If it were more like Batman where enemies avoid each other in order to line up attacks then the counter system might work.  Many of the 'boss' fights aren't difficult, they're merely tedious at best and frustrating at worst. They don't take a lot of skill, just a lot of running a round spamming attacks. The gameplay is irritating enough that I don't want to force my way through even for the story, and I want to know the story because until the show says otherwise; it's canon.  If they had split either direction and gone dynasty warriors against hordes of Grimm (like the show) it would have been good. If they had gone for a more combo oriented arena style fighter it would have worked. Instead they've managed to split the difference between the two just enough for the game to not work either way. As much as I love the show and am following the manga, I can't recommend the game.",

After playing the beta and now finally the official release, I can say that RWBY: Grimm Eclipse...is just okay. The game has very simple mechanics and it doesn't take long for the game to start getting repetitive. The levels are pretty linear and not that interesting. The music is intrumental tracks taken right from the show. All the characters don't feel that different from one another. I will say that the game is pretty challenging though. As I did die quite a number of times. Though that might be the game not responding to my button inputs when it came to countering. Other than that, the game looks decent enough. It does feel like this takes place in the realm of where the show takes place. But really, it's just a standard run-of-the-mill hack'n slash beat'em up game, and not even a really good one. Maybe I expected too much of this game. I mean it's a licensed game based of an ongoing series, and this is the first real game on steam released by Rooster Teeth (at least to my knowledge).

            "review_text": "To summarise it from the get-go, it's not the worst thing ever but it tried to do what it couldn't do. It's also NOT worth that much money. As a RWBY game, I can't really say it's good either, with a lot of weird and nonsensical moments, and a terrible story, even supposed to be canon.   1). Combat    Regarding the Combat, I'd describe it as... tiresome. They attempt to create a basic hack'n'slash core providing you with a Light attack combo that can be interrupted using a Heavy attack to deliver a hit based on the Light attack combo sequence. Pretty common stuff. So what's the problem? Light-Light-Heavy is basically the best thing you can do cause it does high damage, is easy to use and has a big hitbox. It doesn't matter what other attacks there are, Light-Light-Heavy spam is what you will be doing against most monsters, build your 'Ultimate' by generally attacking and then use that.  There is an upgrade system as you level up which allows you to increase your effectiveness of some of your attacks, improve your defenses or gain some passive benefits. It's not the worst upgrade system I've seen honestly. Upgrading your attacks has an actual effect on what they do and picking a slightly different build during a playthrough can be beneficial depending on the situation. Too bad it has to accompany such boring combat.    2). Level Design    I don't care if they made everything, but this feels like a bunch of pre-built assets thrown together. It doesn't feel like you are in the world of RWBY at all. Neither visually since textures lean towards the slightly realistic, not 3D anime, nor logically. What I mean by 'logically' is that they tried to make a linear design but forgot the characters we are playing are capable of jumping from falling rock to falling rock and then land on a giant flying bird. That's straight out of one of the first episodes. You'd expect a lot of verticality and acrobatics and there is none of that. Heck, on the latest areas our characters need to go through some 'gates' that you can visually jump over in-game! It's like they hired people that never saw the show, even after they got hired.  The game is indeed VERY short, but it was 'made to be replayed multiple times'. Can't say they nailed that really. It lasts a bit too long to make me want to play it again, but not long enough to say that I got what I wanted.    3). General enemy variety    Enemy variety... yeah there is some, but most of them can be killed using the same Light-Light-Heavy attack spam, or a charged up Heavy attack to spice things up! That was sarcasm. We are on the internet, I need to make that clear. Personally, I got bored fighting these enemies by now, and it's not even because it's the same ones over and over, that's fine! It's that you deal with all of them the same freaking way, just some have a bit more health and some need you to dodge out of the way sometimes.  But whatever, surely a RWBY game will have some cool bosses, right?! Well, the final boss is kind of interesting... since it's the only unique boss. And even then, it's easier than normal packs of Wolves. I'd say this is very disappointing, especially since it has nothing but combat.    4). Overall Performance    Okay, the only good thing that came out of this is that performance has improved, at least on my system. The game lacks a proper settings menu for some reason, but they did put some thought into optimising the game a bit. Got a good enough PC? You can run it. Drops can happen when playing with a lot of people at certain areas, but nothing completely gamebreaking.   In case it wasn't clear enough, I really dislike the direction combat took. On the Early Access launch, while it was way more simple, it was fast paced and extremely fun. Instead of building upon that, they decided to do something they didn't have the time and/or talent to and made a failed attempt of a complex combo system.  The actual cast is in the game which is cool. It was made by Rooster Teeth themselves after all, but whoever was writing the story, even if it was leftovers by the late Monty himself, did a terrible job. The villain is obvious and predictable to say the least, checking a fair amount of cliches from the cliche villain list. The one liners that the characters say can sometimes be like they told the actresses to just say whatever comes in their heads and I swear that they sound more and more bored as the story goes on. Also there is absolutely zero vocal interaction between them, and you'd think that would be an obvious thing to do.  It's just a mess honestly. There is an attempt from Rooster Teeth to make a game, but it was not good. But despite all that, at a lower price, a fan could enjoy playing as their favourite characters for a bit. It's totally not worth 25 dollars, okay? But maybe at 10 or so you could get it and play through it once just to play as a character from the show.",

Its fairly incomplete but I would definitely recommend getting the dlc for the 5 extra bucks. Its just a small increase but definitely makes the game more enjoyable due to the dlc characters being more fluid than the original 4. When it comes to controls, the game is much easier with a controller due to being able to combo easier. It makes it easier to use to few frames to counter enemy attacks which is basically the only way to survive when being swarmed. There are some exploits I've been able to use in the system such as constantly countering as Blake when there are a horde of beowolves in order to just evade all damage. Its a pretty mediocre game for fans with pretty good multiplayer if you have friends (which you don't) but it probably should be priced lower even with more progress being made on the game.

It may also be worth noting I bought the game during the Summer Sale, while it was only 10$ and before the price got jacked up again.  I really want to like this game. I really like RWBY and Hack and Slash games keep me busy for long periods of time. The graphics in this are adequate (not like next-gen or anything, but nice) which are very similar to the original show. Combat, movement, and all that jazz is really smooth, flows nicely.  That being said, there isn't much content right now. Most areas have similar requirements, like 'fend off 5 waves of grimm' or 'just keep hitting ♥♥♥♥ til the boss shows up' which progresses the game and allows you to continue to the next area. Of course, there are only 4 playable characters at the time I'm writing this, just the main characters from Team RWBY, Ruby, Weiss, Yang and Blake. So not much variety there. The variety in monsters isn't very high either, there are only about 5 different types of monsters (excluding bosses) that spawn, and once you play for about 10 minutes, you'll learn how to attack/defend against each one.  This game has a huge amount of potential. There is room to add characters from the other teams in the show, team JNPR, maybe Team CFVY, Team CRDL and Team SSSN, along with Neo, Cinder and Emerald. Lots more to expand on there. Maybe add more maps and missions, add some new monsters to add variety to the gameplay. It has a lot of room to grow, but right now, as a first full official release, I can't say recommend it. Maybe get it while it's on sale, the devs seem to listen to people's suggestions so they'll probably add more content. It's a really fun game, but gets somewhat stale quickly, I woudn't recommend buying it for the full price.",

While the combat is very fun and killing Grimm with three other people, more so when its the full team RWBY, is awesome this game is on the short side and feel like a episode from Volume 1 of RWBY. But the games does have a couple of highlights. With the full team, as in one of each charecter, Ruby and her teammates banter and comments on whats going on do feel in charecter and acts as the humor of the game. Combat is simple and easy to understand and the music is amazing. However the combat itself does get tiring as all combat is kill waves of Grimm. But regardless a non RWBY fan may not find much enjoyment in this game's story, they'll most likely be horrible confused as the game expects one to at least watch Volume 1 of RWBY. There is no explaination in game as to who Team RWBY is or what the Grimm are. Also the cost of this game is way to much. With all this in mind, as said before, I can only recommed this game for truly die hard RWBY fans. However even fans of that caliber may not buy this game. For non fans absolutely not you can buy better games for 25$.  Hopefully the game will become much better with future updates. Until then its better to stick with the show.",

            "review_text": "Now, I love the RWBY series. I like the story and mythos. However, I cannot recommend the game currently. For starters, I got this game during the summer sale and I only played about 85 mins. It was about $10 when I got it and I notice something pretty weird. Previously, this game started as $15. After an update, it went to $20. Now it is $25. Hopefully this is its final stand but it is pretty strange to rise your price over time when other games from early access stayed the same price at full release. Now other than that, lets go over the pro's and con's of this game. Note: This is quite lengthy, so I will make a short review on it at the bottom.  Pro's:  1. Models: So far, the models have reverted back to their early state, which is very similar to the show models. That is an improvement considering the small controversy on the model change upon the first major update, making the models look a bit dated and weird.  2. Combat: The combat in this game is more of a hack and slash, so if you are not into hack and slash, this will get boring fast. However, the combat animations are on point and show off the characters movesets. Each have their signature style of combat and it shows the amount of effort put in to work on the combat animations to resemble those from the show.  3. Graphics: The looks and art style of the show are here in the game. It is bright, colorful. While most are recycled and quite dull at times, it is obvious the developers want you to feel like you are in the shows universe.  4. Voice-acting: The voice acting is great. Some points, not so much, but mostly well spoken and similar to the show.  Con's:  1. Lack of content: Now as I said, this is a hack and slash and it does get quite samey. You got repeated monsters and not much variation than mash buttons to win. However, not much has really changed from its early access to its release. So far, only more maps were added to the story. So if you wanted more characters other than team RWBY, you are out of luck.  2. Price: The price point of this game is ridiculous. For $25, this will feel shallow unless you are planning multiple playthroughs with all 4 members of RWBY and can withstand the grind. Other than that, this game feels like a $15 game than a $25. I would hold on to your money and wait for either more content or till the price drops.  3. No new characters: Now, on the news, it is stated that upon the full release new characters will be added. Where are they? There is still the same team RWBY available. Now I understand that making the models and animations are tough but when you advertise and promise to have new characters upon launch, I expect it. Because of this, some consumers are more wary of the developers and holding off when they cannot withhold the promises they made upon launch. Now they did state that more characters will be added for free later on but I cannot accept the fact that no new characters were available on launch.  4. Combat upgrades: Now, it is no suprise that the game has a level up system in it to upgrade whichever character you play, however, the pre-requisites are out of proportion. 300 range kills? 150 ult kills? Now, this may not seem like a lot to others but when you are playing 4 player co-op, with everyone running off like headless chickens taking your kills, it becomes a chore to get there. Sure, you can play with friends and ask them to let you take the last hit kills to level up but in random matches, it is quite difficult to accumilate. 'But the game has singleplayer cross-connection. Wouldn't that mean you can level up in singleplayer as well to get the level ups?' Yes but not that the game raises the difficulty the more players there are in the match, and by raising the difficulty, it means spawning more things. So in singleplayer, you may only accumulate about roughly 60-70 kills at bestor you can join a 4 player co-op and rack up 200-250 kills (that is if you get most of the kills itself). So you will need to grind hard and make sure you are not spamming the attack buttons to try get the unlocks itself because for most new players, it will become quite difficult to not mash the attack button just to get 1 more range kill.  5. Story: Story is mediocore at best. It is in between season 2 and season 3. It is quite dull and you will not care much about it at all later on as it becomes obvious and see plot lines from miles away.  !TL:DR!  Pro's: good models great voice acting has the feel of the universe good hack and slash combat  Con's: bare content ridiculous price no Neopolitan (I cry everytime ;~;) grindy upgrades meh story  All in all, its not a terrible game, not in the long mile but it is quite lacking. Its like drinking soda. You can drink as much as you want but you will always feel a bit lacking or wanting more by the end. Overall, I would say it is about 5/10 at the current state. It's not groundbreaking standards but not ♥♥♥♥♥. I would save your money and wait till it hits a sale for about $15 or $10 or wait for more content to release. Thankfully, most of the updates will be free but this is most likely like Titanfall, you will power it up only to play about 1-3 matches at best.",

            "review_text": "As a huge RWBY fan, this game actually dissapoints me quite a bit... There are good pieces, however the game is just lacking the depth and length it needs for a $24.99 full on release. The good: Co-op Game feels very responsive and fast. That's about it....  The bad: Combat gets very repetitive VERY quickly Very few enemy types (I believe only 8-9 including the final boss) Poor leveling system Only 4 characters (more probably released as DLC) Abilities feel useless when you find the OP one (not balanced) Boring, generic story   Combat doesn't make sense.... it almost feels like they were going for the Arkham games style here, but it just feels very wrong. If you ever get into danger in combat, you can just spam air dash to regenerate your health within a few seconds and continue fighting. The only times I died were when I got wombo-combo'd by the androids. The leveling system seems to be not that well thought out either, because it requires you to kill a certain amount of enemies with each ability to be able to level it fully. This either forces you to spam one ability and make the combat even less fun, or ignore it completely and not be able to level any of them fully (we're talking 300 kills with each ability). If you level up your heal rate, you can be full health in about 5 seconds out of combat. Tougher opponents don't feel tough, because 1 move will take 1/4 of their health after you counter their wind-up. This game in singleplayer took me about 3 hours to complete max, and there doesn't seem to be much replayability. I hit level 10 (max level) waaaaayyy before the final boss because the chess pieces you find will give you tons of extra XP that isn't necessary. This game just doesn't feel well polished, as there were areas that it didn't want me to go into, but still could because of the air dash, which ended up resulting in me finding more chess pieces that it didn't want me to have.   As a huge RWBY fan, this game is a let-down, and I would definitely wait until the game is more well polished or more content is added for a $24.99 price point.  4/10 below average.",

Yes, I know DMC games also come with a $60 price tag on launch, but they're still worth it. This game does not feel worth the money in the slightest. Too few enemies, absolutely no dynamic interactions. This game is just a hollow shell of what it could have been, that just so happened to sell well simply because it's an official RWBY title. While I can't fault the devs for that, this game has no soul at all, and I'm pretty sure the devs also know that. Anyone with the ability to have an unbiased view will see that when they play this game too. Overall 4/10 game.",

            "review_text": "Well, Grimm Eclipse is finally off of Early Access. Sadly, I have to write a scathing review rather than give it the tongue bath I would have liked to. Let's get this out of the way: Even if you are a fan of RWBY, this game is not worth the money. If you aren't a fan of RWBY, you are excused. You have other Steam listings to look at in your search for a hacky/slashy fun run. For the RWBY fans who are still here, let me explain what seems to have gone wrong.  Grimm Eclipse was in early access for some time. And in that time, it came a long way from the launch, it really did. Combat was adjusted, sfx levels were adjusted, and the models that came straight out of the show got axed for some arcane reason. Then a few extra bland levels got stapled to the back half and it was deemed finished.  The game is short, the characters play very similarly to one another (smash heavy attack or DIE), and the writing is short on the charm you may have come to expect on the shore. The game puts in a couple jumping puzzles in a desperate bid to keep things varied, but it falls flat, even when a lampshade gets hung on the situation. The fact that this callout was less gentle ribbing and more being hit over the head in case you missed it did not help matters.  Spoilers from this point on. The worst part about this is the absolute waste of the villain, Dr. Merlot. He receives some slight foreshadowing in the first couple areas that the game began Early Access with, but after he starts talking to the characters, any hope of him being interesting or complex gets buried like the rest of my hope for this game. Ozpin is no better when he starts up his back and forth with Merlot. Good guys yay, bad guys boo, now go stop Dr Wily. I mean Merlot.  It probably seems like I'm harping on this point a bit, but Dr. Merlot's actions are the sum total of the plot. His mark is left all over security breaches in Beacon's network, and he breeds mutated Grimm. Neither of these points are ever explained, even at the end. The titular team investigates this, learns nothing, smashes up the lab and calls it a night. If RWBY was a monster of the week kind of show, this would be excusable. More so at least. But RWBY is a long term narrative, and if Merlot was at least painted as complex, or threatening, or if at any point we had some insight into why he was doing what he's doing, it might have worked a little better, and I wouldn't feel so cheated. Instead, we get a cartoonishly evil scientist with no desire beyond making monsters. What an absolute mess.  The gameplay isn't better. Early areas are alright. Smash up some Grimm of varying types, some are tougher than the rest, counter when they wind up, and anything but the most basic enemy you can use your Heavy attack to break their guard. Which is always up. So your light attack, which should probably be your main method of attack, becomes almost worthless. Ursa are a pain to fight, since even heavy attacks don't stagger them, so you instead have to wait for them to stagger themselves. Waiting should not be a key factor in a hack and slash. Things get worse in the late levels of the game which introduce robotic enemies, which I had to cheese with Ruby's stun bullet ability to get a chance to hurt. Their range is too long, they knock you out of your attacks even as they receive yours with unflinching determination, and have a nasty habit of coming in pairs for maximum annoyance. Their gunner friends that show up later are just as irritating, as they jump backwards and blast the ground you're standing in faster than you can cancel your combo and evade the attack.  And the last boss fight is an absolute joke. Stand in front of him, wait for the weak point to become apparent, smack it as fast as you can, repeat. There's no method to force the weak point out beyond waiting, and I already talked about why that's not good. Defeating the enemy somehow makes Merlot's plans fall apart. Oh, and Merlot contributes only tired dialogue to the end fight. He doesn't even escape, he just loses without ceremony or closure.  As for what's good about the game: The voice cast from the series reprise their roles here, and perform well. Even Merlot doesn't sound bad, he's just poorly scripted. Sadly, so is Ozpin. Everyone else makes it through more or less intact. Even with the updated models, the game looks good. The team's movements are well animated, attacks are flashy and cool, and the enemies at least look interesting, even if they themselves aren't. Environments are visually pleasing as well, and you're not likely to get lost. Unfortunately, that's all I can really praise about the game. Things that were brought over from the show.  TLDR: Wait for Volume 4 instead.",

Sadly early acess kept crashing my computer, so I didn't dare touch this game until recently.   I was really hoping for more characters, seeing as how it didn't really matter if we played as RWBY, JNPR, or even SSSN. Who the characters were had no bearing on the story, and no one was adressed by name except the teachers. I guess It would just be between the Beacon groups, but they could've made an excuse as to why they were taking orders from different teachers. For such a short game I was atleast hoping for a bit more character variety. It really wouldv'e been nice to see other characters fighting styles. The show shows us very clearly what RWBY can do, what most of JNPR can really do, but we can only guess on the aura's, techniques, and special moves other characters would have.   with all the game available this game wouldn't be the first thing I'd recommend to someone, but I'll thumbs it up just because it's not a bad game. It just need's a LOT more work, and honesly I'm falling out of love with RWBY, but not because it's bad.  It has it's moments, but time inbetween is so long with nothing to hype us up, I get drawn into other games/shows. Sure we had RWBY chibi, but goofy 2 minute scenes can only hold a person for so long. I was hoping that Grimm Eclipse would keep me hooking inbetween seasons, but it just doesn't do it.

Have a friend that I watched the show and discussed stuff regularly with, and we'd been debating getting the game for awhile. The summer sale was when we decided to take the plunge. It was...alright. Pretty fun actually. We both felt that Yang and Blake were kinda meh, and Weiss' ability to freeze things, along with Ruby's combos were crazy strong. Character customization, or specialization I guess, was pretty barebone, but ah well, it's Early Access right? We actually didn't even have any problem with the character models. Not the second ones, those were awful. But the ones that came after? Meh, good enough.   Then they announced the game's full launch. I honestly wasn't thinking much on it, but I browsed the various RWBY places (Here and reddit) to see what the word on the street was, so to speak, and people brought up some good points. 'How could this be close to a full launch? There's nothing here. This is barely a beta! There's no way there's enough to justify a full release!' Those are the things I heard and it got me thinking. And kinda worrying. But hey, no sense in judging so soon, I say. Let the game speak for itself! Then you can talk about it. After you've SEEN it for yourself!  Then I saw it for myself. Man. I'm not gonna complain about Team JNPR or anything like that. It's still the gameplay I enjoyed with my friend, and Yang even kinda felt stronger than she was before. But...the game just feels so so barren. Like one of those games you see that use those, like, asset packs. The models are fine. I like them. They look enough like the main four for me that whatever their reason for changing the original models, no big deal. The rest of the game though, not so much.   Other random things that bugged me.  The UI feels flat, the music isn't super exciting, the amount of invisible walls was and is still frustrating, the EXP being based on killing blow is frustrating (yes the assist EXP is here now, but man, it's totally possible to just hog EXP for the characters with devastating AoE attacks), and the subtitles, oh man. It may sound weird to complain about, but it just feels so LAZY the way they just drop a literal huge chunk of text at the bottom of the screen. Is timing individual lines super difficult or something? And they shrunk the text down to fit too.  Bottom Line, I guess. It's fun. I enjoyed playing with my friend. But, it doesn't feel like a complete game. It doesn't feel like a professionally made game. It doesn't feel like a game that costs $24.99 is the bottom line I'm getting at. I could recommend it at $10 or maybe $15, but not $25, not for what it is. And the 'DLC is coming!' thing doesn't fly with big name devs, so it's not gonna fly here, not with me anyways.   Disclaimer about product for free: My friend and I are goofs, and we just bought each other the game when it was on sale. This is technically free, but I paid for my friend's copy.

Saying that, if you are, I would recommend only for the potential this game has, but as it is looking in the current situation, even fans may npt want this game. The devs released a game saying it is not early access anymore, when it should be. The game still has too many bugs and issues to be a full release, however, I hope the devs learn from their mistakes and continue to update this game in the right direction (which should be focusing on these bugs, and NOT on DLC). Now that my introduction is out of the way, lets get to the pros and cons. (I plan on updating this review as things get fixed and changed)  Pros:  -It's a RWBY game -Full voice acting  -references to episodes (not something deal making here but it's nice for fans) -in it's basics, fun gameplay -huge potential -Development team seems to be very passionate about this game, and is willing to work very, very hard to make it amazing (despite them occasionally screwing up)  Cons: -minor bugs (nothing really game breaking, but bugs are bugs. Also, if you have managed to play this game without coming across bugs, then buy a lottery ticket cause I don't think thats possible) -running animation can be awkward at times, especially on slopes -no one stays for a full game. too much drop-in, drop-out -not the most fun unless 4 people are playing and with the whole drop-in, drop-out situation, you better get used to being with 1 other person 1 minute, and 3 others the next. -not single player (possibly a pro depending on point of views, but personally, I was hoping for a single player game) -enemies are way too repetitive. more enemy variety would be nice, but I expect that to come in these next months. -cons outweigh the pros at this point. only enjoyable by RWBY fans at this point  In the end, it is an early access, so i did not expect a perfect game. there is a huge amount of potential as I have stated many times and I expect this game to be great when it is complete. I hope that there will be DLC characters as this would make the game more enticing for those that ahve their favourite character on another team. As this game progresses, I plan on changing this review and watching the cons list shrink as the pros grow.  Final thoughts: Recommended for a RWBY fan, but no one else until it gets better.  If anyone disagrees with any of my points, feel free to write a comment. I would love to hear others oponions about my opinions (let's be civil and mature about this though please). if anyone agrees with my points, I would also love to hear that.",

Pros: - Good, entertaining gameplay mechanics. - You can play as any of your favorite characters from Team RWBY, and, if you bought the DLC, JNPR as well. - Pretty easy to set up and play with friends. - Unlike many games, you don't need to worry when you mess up a character's skill points. You can respec them in between games, which refunds ALL skill points for no cost. Put the points wherever you want, and think about it later! XD - Pretty good graphics. Nothing revolutionary, but still pretty good.  Cons: - Animation glitches sometimes. - Controls seem a little jumpy at times, although they are usually fine. - Aiming your ranged attack has no crosshairs or anything. Some home in though, so not a huge issue. - VERY COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE. The lowest setting, 'Potato' only barely works on my computer despite it being a 3.5 GHZ 10 core processor. While the graphics are good, they are not nearly good enough to warrant that kind of power draw. I can't imagine why on earth it would be so bad. Fallout 4 runs better on my computer.   Lastly, the reason for many of the bad reviews is because if you do singleplayer, many of the enemies can stun lock you in corners making it so you cannot do anything until you die. This, however, is because the game is meant to be multiplayer. Usually, there would be other people who would be helping beat up said enemies, so they would not be able to do that. You can safely ignore any review that says such, as it means they probably don't understand how the game was meant to be played.",

'this is it?' advertised as a 'hack &amp; slash' but is a strategy game.   For some reason I was expecting a Dynasty Warrior play style game, &amp; it isn't.  This game in story mode &amp; harder difficulties will find yourself running around in a circle, repeating the same moves over &amp; over &amp; over again. If you mess up one time good game, enemies will combo hit you &amp; you'll die.   Majority of the game you're not actually fighting, so what are you doing? Dodging, running, waiting around for the right moment to strike... a single shot.  So... you're about 9 character lengths away from the enemy, guess what you'll get hit.  SO... you're visually strikin the enemy but the enemy recieve no damage, nothing new.   Oh wait you just spent 5 minutes running around &amp; you slipped up one time, well guess what you're dead.  I'm sorry but this game so far is the worse game I have played on steam. This game is also a great let down, 'hack &amp; slash' more like 'hack wait around for 30 seconds then slash'.   Story: was very boring.  Game Play: was boring.   The only reason i have as many hours as I do is for the achievements.   I do like the 'horde' play mode.   ",

Without these, the game suffers immensely, and becomes an O.K. Beat-em-Up game with very little variety and bland level structure.   The game starts off on an alright foot with the first few introductory levels. While they are no where near as complex as you would hope, they at least have some visual flare to them, and the characters do have unique dialog between them to keep things going.   Unfortunately, it is after these first few levels that the game begins to show its unpolished side. The destroyed city area and onward is very dull and repetative, with the one variation provided the level after being more of an annoyance than an improvement.   The DLC does help somewhat here. The combat mechanics present for Team JNPR work well for the characters, and provide much more cooperative incentive than the original cast does. Other than these differences, the characters level up the exact same: They kill enemies and put points into skills they want to improve. You have to kill several tens or even hundreds of foes to unlock an upgrade to obtain, and the nature of this game means that such numbers will only be reached when playing with friends, otherwise it becomes an unbearable slog of groundhog day levels of repetition.   If you have friends who love RWBY as much as you do, then pick this game up and the JNPR DLC. The cooperative gameplay is enjoyable enough to warrant a few hours of play time, even if the game does not fully end after those hours. Hopefully, in the future, I can come back and change my tune about this game. There is still plenty of promise in the RWBY universe...it's simply a matter of letting it come through.",

The dlc has a survival mode and all of team JNPR which I thought I was getting with the base game, but because it's dlc I don't think this game is worth it without a STEEP sale.",

I happend to buy it months ago for pretty cheap, and upon playing it again with it's release today, I do say it is a fun little hack and slash with characters from a series I like. The only real complaint I have is that I played it from beginning to end..level 1-10, in around 2 hours. The only replayability is leveling all the characters and unlocking their abilities, only to rank up, which is essentially a prestige mechanic, and do it all over again..and again..to get up to rank 10 for the achievment. It'll take multiple full game runs to get a single rank up. Other than that, if it's played in short bursts it can be a fun little time waister. I do recamend giving this a try, I just feel sorry for those paying the current price tag.   Anyway, good or bad, I just basically look at it like this, I've invested my money in the IP with the hopes that in the future, a much more in depth game will be made.",

It leads to hilarity)  - Solid fun, and a solid game.  - SO MANY PUNS  Cons:  - HOLY MOTHER OF LAG.

I picked this game up on sale for $20, so for about 33 cents an hour, I'd say it was worth it. I do not recomend the DLC. Overall this game is made immensely more entertaining by the online community. Unlike other online games, for the most part, this one isn't toxic. It made the online parts of this game really fun. The story does get old after the 12th time or so playing it (every rank resets EVERYTHING…) but you learn new things about each map every time. By the time you reach rank 10, you’ve probably learned all the spots you can break the invisible walls and you will be exploring the out-of-bounds area thoroughly. That there is truly fun end-game content (no seriously, you try playing 'is this floor/mountain/building real' its intense!) The achievements in this game are hard (and slightly grindy), but not punishing. And that’s the important bit, I actually enjoyed the challenge of the achievements. I felt they were all fair and fun to get. Over all I love this game, and will continue to play it in the future.

Badass animu gals dodging around at ♥♥♥♥ing light speeds with gun-scythes, shotgun-gauntlets, magic rapiers and whatever the ♥♥♥♥ blake has. In short, the combat needs to be faster and more intense.  - Soundtrack. Ok seriously this is my biggest ♥♥♥♥ing problem here. RWBY has one of the best ♥♥♥♥ing fighting soundtracks I have ever heard, evidence being the Yang and Weiss vs Flint and Neon fight seriouslyholy♥♥♥♥ingshitIlovethemusicitssogoodbutanyway: The soundtrack during fights in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. It uses the default track of the level itself which is often just calming exploration music, which is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! GIVE US THE REAL RWBY MUSIC!  - They recently teased the addition of team JNPR to the game which I will await excitedly seriously guys we get to play as Jaune holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ I hope he is the biggest joke character. Jaune is litterally the Speedwagon of RWBY. The Dan Hibiki of Beacon Academy. All praise base Jaune. Also the addition of more waifus is always a good thing, good to know Roosterteeth really appreciate the sheer waifu material that is Pyrrha and Nora.  - No Zwei in sight seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ Roosterteeth I mean I know its early development but seriously Zwei is based god.  It may seem as though I am listing more flaws rather than positives (even though I totally am), I reccomend picking up the game if you are a true RWBY fan, the game screams potential with a solid level system and an original plot (rather than it simply being a retelling of volume 1). I must say they were on point with character personalities though so far I mean Yang makes puns every 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes it is brilliant.  If you do wish to buy it however, buy it when it is on sale, the game dosen't yet have enough content to warrant a £19 price tag. With a little bit more polish this game has the potential to become a glorious tribute to RWBY... but I swear if these ♥♥♥♥ers don't make Penny and Zwei playable I swear to anyone reading right now I will pour bleach into my computer.",

I love the characters, the story, and the acting to such a degree that I have created my own team for personal fun. In the context of this game, I can't say that I love it as much as the series, however. Don't get me wrong, I like this game - however, it doesn't feel like it's completely 'RWBY' (I apologize that I can't explain it better).  There are very few issues that I have with the game: the first and most important is the graphics usage. While I enjoy the scenic backgrounds and high-end designs, my computer is having lag problems on occassion (my computer is a Gaming Series MSI). On top of that, my friend whom I bought a copy of the game for is unable to run the game on the Potato setting, so the co-op option is out for us.  I appreciated that the Grimm Eclipse team added in a Single Player mode, but even then the game seems lacking if all you do is run around the same way in co-op. I'm hoping that Horde Mode and the JNPR update helps with this, but I can't imagine how it would.  Speaking of the DLC, I think it would benefit from a Season Pass, especially if there are plans to add more teams (which I believe this game would desperately need). While 4.99USD isn't much for a single team (and I understand why it costs anything at all), if you want to keep an audience, constant updates would be good for the game. Conversely, you could simply sequelize the game, but I'd like to think that a good majority doesn't want to spend another 25.00USD for a mediocre game.  I say again, I like this game. If there were more to it, or lower-end computers could play it better, I would wholeheartedly recommend it. However, at this point in time, I can't give it full points, nor can I just say 'Don't buy it'. Since I'm writing this literally a day before the new DLC releases, I may be premature in saying this, but it is truly what I feel.  If you like RWBY and are willing to try anything once, or just need a time-passer, I will recommend this game. Otherwise, I would hold off until there is either a price drop, or a new character DLC.  The game is not 'incomplete', it just lacks 'something' - what that 'something' is, you may have to find out for yourself.",

My only main gripe with the game is that there is no way to pick up where you left off if you are playing multiplayer and want to take a break. It is a short game, but it is a hassle trying to make it to the end in one sitting. I hope that are able to fix that in subsequent updates.",

First of all, I wanna point out the fact that this game is a HACK 'N' SLASH! It's a type of game just like Darksiders, EXCEPT there is no side quests and stuff... Also, the team behind this game is SMALL! They do everything that they can to bring every RWBY fan the enjoyment of playing the game. From my point of view, I've been seeing a lot of hate reviews in here. I would say I don't agree with them. They probably just dislike the fact that the game is too small and you need to pay a lot. But, HEY! Just because I'm a RWBY fan, doesn't mean that I will say that i love everything about this game. Of course there are some cons of this game! Just like in EVERY game! And to be more specific, I'll write them down right in here! Cons: - No P.v.P. (most of the game is about killing Grimm); - Only 4 characters (there might be more in the future, not up to me); - Not Open World (that means you will have to play the same chapters, every single time you finish the campaign with no changes whatsoever, meaning that there are no side-quests); - The only thing that the game offers for you to explore is trying to find hidden artifacts (which are totally not hard to find); - The price (it was 14.99€ before, now it's 22,99€ and will PROBABLY increase even more). AND those are all the cons, in my opinion... Finally, the reasons why I play this game: - The gameplay is very enjoyable; - The soundtrack is nice; - The environment of every chapter makes me feel that I am truly in the World of Remnant; - I'm a huge RWBY fan, so I get really hyped when I play the game (kind of a weird sentence to say, but whatever); - The game will become even better with time. And that's it for my review! Hope it was a helpful review for everyone thinking of buying the game! For the final question, would I recommend this game?  The answer is... It depends.  Most of the time, if you haven't seen the show, you will have some hard time to understand what you are really playing and what you're getting yourself into AND of course, if you enjoy or don't enjoy hack 'n' slash type of games. BUT, if you're someone who loves RWBY like me, then I'll definitely recommend it!",

But besides the point i would give this game a 7/10  For some reason why not a 10 -Spolier the final boss kind of anti climatic but i will go in more detail about that later -Story its ok not terrible but decent  -little dialog between characters   {the reason why i say this is a big negative to me is that one of the coolest parts of the show was how all of the characters communicated with each other and interacted}  Reason why a 7  -The game play is fun landing combos are enjoyable and hit a counter is always satisfying -team comp: the team aspect is nice with helping your team kill enemys fast and they always have a nice effect -Art is easy to look at and is very artistic which is always a good thing   So should you buy it: well if you like a beat em up that has a good reply value then i would say, yes..yes it is worth the money. However if you have friends that also like this style of game then that is definetly yes this game shines the most when you have people to play with. Just remeber that the game was developed on a whem of the fans of the show so dont set the bar to high.   RANT: SPOLIER ABOUT FINAL BOSS FIGHT: That final boss fight wasnt the best by any means this is the point in the game were i saw the games short comings. Like half of the boss fight i just stayed on the other side of the room taughting for ♥♥♥♥ in giggles with a friend. As well as half of the bosses moves were close ranged attacks which were useless because there is no point in me being close to him because i cant hurt him most of the time. its not all bad the design for him is A+ and the spawning enemies were nice but it never ventured in to the hardest enemies like the armored bear or the mutant beowolf. Defininitly one of the biggest short comings of the game.  Conclusion: Worth buying if you like the style of game just dont expect the best story.

Speaking of setting menu, it feels like a port from other platform cause options are very few. Really really few. Sure they added some feature making character level persistent, aka you now have a 'progress' to move on.

So I recommend this game to someone part of this wonderful fandom because that's one of the way to keep in touch with all the fantastic people there are in it and talking about this I found a lot of other fans to talk with and also someone to call friend just because 'affinity' beginning to the love for RWBY..!! ^_^",

            "review_text": "I'll say this as the first thing you should consider regarding this game:  Have zero expectations.  This game started out as a fan project that got picked up by Rooster Teeth. It is not by any means a great game, but that doesn't mean it's any less enjoyable.  The game has a story separate from the animated series. It's nothing big, but it's good enough. The combat moves and mixups options are limited, but they look as good as in the show. Although the characters share the same inputs, they still play completely different. Compare it to the controls in Super Smash Bros. if you will.  There is no end game. The replayability is also limited to just maxing out characters, for now. This might change with the October 2016 update in which they introduce a new gametype.  That all said, I've spent 4 hours on this game the first day it came out, and I have really enjoyed those 4 hours. Find the right people to play story with in matchmaking, or just play with friends, and it makes the experience even better. It's great for killing time, it's great for just fooling around with people. You'll find a lot of randoms that don't talk, but the people that do are almost always great company. The in-game dialogues are also great, especially with Yang. You can't go wrong with her puns.  I'm still looking forward to the future of RWBY:Grimm Eclipse, but again, I have no expectations. Wishes, yes, but no expectations. I'll take it as it is, I'll enjoy whatever they can offer me, and won't complain about what the game doesn't have. It's not great, it might not even be good, but I still find it enjoyable and that's enough for me.",

            "review_text": "First off going to state my bias as a massive fan of the show and games that let me punch things in the face.  Presentation The game mirrors the artstyle of the show closely: bright, anime-esque, not massively detailed. The soundtrack is also borrowed from the show which put a massive smile on my face at points however i feel there needs to be more work done tailoring the soundtrack (length, looping, adding unique tracks). I enjoyed most of the dialog and party banter except for ozpin who didn't sound quite right to me, special note goes to yang's near constant puns  Gameplay Died several times early on due to being fragile, put against several high damage enemies and not given a tutorial on dodging and countering, however once those are mastered there is little to no excuse for dying and combat quickly became a routine of: perform favourite combo, dodge/counter, repeat. There are only about 9 unique enemy types in the game and 3 types of mission so the campaign can get repetitive.  In the end i've been following this game since the original fan release and i'm impressed with how it's come along so far, but it still has a long way to go so i recommend waiting for a major content update or it goes on sale",

Though the best part is the combat it is similar to a Dynasty Warriors game series and Similar to the Legend of Zelda Hyrule Warriors which was modeled after the Dynasty Warriors games. So I would highly recomend this to those of you who have played those games. I think that many players will also really enjoy the Characters shout outs during the play though.",

Having 4 new characters to play as is worth it for me, and I can see why they would charge money for it.  Stating bias right now: I am a huge fan of RWBY, and have been watching it since the first episode.  Looking at the gameplay and ignoring the whole RWBY part, the game isn't particularly special but is still fun. For me its the  a e s t h e t i c  and universe that ties it together. There is something outstandingly fun about mowing down Grimm. The developers definately delivered on their promise of JNPR and horde mode. Overall, fun game on its own but requires background knowledge in RWBY to fully enjoy.",

There are lots of achivements to get that will take time and effort while others will only take a few seconds. Each character is complex and has different strengths and weaknesses so learning to play with them adds an extra level of difficulty but also enjoyment to the game (don't play as Weiss while using Yang's fighting style, all it gets you is lots and lots of death). I normalyl play as Yang, and when I tried to play as any of the other characters it felt like I was new to the game again because all of their attacks function differently.  On top of all that, the game is entertaining, and I can say that I am excited every single day when I come home because I know that I will play RWBY before I go to bed.  Overall, this game is much more than I could have every expected it to be, and while the price is pretty high, I most certainly believe that it is worth every penny.",

The nice thing is the game doesn't end if someone's internet drops. Only if the host drops. So make sure the host has a really good internet connection if you don't wanna start the level over.  Basically if you're not hosting and your internet drops, you can easily leave the game and jump right back in. You'll know if that happens because you won't be able to attack but you can move. You can also jump in and join anyone who's in the middle of a game. That's mega bonus for this game. The downside is it doesn't keep your stats if you dropped. I will never know if I'm better than my friends cause my internet drops for 2 seconds an average of every 5 minutes. But that's not much of a negative unless you're really competitive with your friends.  The other downside for those that watch the show is team RWBY are the only playable characters right now. (I really like Emerald so it is a bit of a letdown not to play as her, ah well). Is that any reason to not get the game? That's up to you.

This left Yang players in the dust for those who played her before whatever changed the three abilities to an ult and combos. As Yang you could get a few perks in her tree that let her use her abilities, take a few hits, and use her abilities again, get away, regen, repeat. And it was solid for solo players. I don't play the other three as much, and I didn't play Weiss at all before so I can't call anything on them, but I really do think this shattered the game for me with huge spikes of damage reduced to, firing missles, puching enemies back, and an ult that you have to upgrade to make even slightly useful, or at least for Yang.",

I literally only bought it so that I could play with my friend who is, in his own words, a 'die-hard fan who loves RWBY more than anything else in the world.'   Now that all that is out of the way, I would like to say that, even as a person who's never watched the show, it seems like this has A LOT of potential. I really and truly hope that the developers at Rooster Teeth are able to help this game fulfill all of its potential.  Edit: It seems like they are well on their way to fullfilling it.    EDIT: They've more-or-less achieved the potential, read for more info.  So, on to the actual review. Let's start with the positives.  PROS:  -Really beautiful environments  -Animations and textures are very well done.  -Great voice acting (IMO)  -Fun to play with Friends  -In combat, the controls feel rather satisfying. Something about doing a long combo on an enemy that's helpless to counter.  --The combat is fairly well balanced and the enemies can be quite difficult, but still fun  Update #3: Thanks to the last two or three updates, the game feels a lot better in general.   CONS:   -No way to save your character information for a future playthrough. It would also be nice to be able to select the level or section you wished to play, so you could immediately jump to the point you wanted to be. (i.e. Half-Life 1+2 Level Selection type thing)     (I now understand this is intentional, as the game is meant to be played this way.)      EDIT: It's been added!! This has been updated so that people can play singleplayer and choose which level they want to get to after they've reached it on a playthrough.   -Invisible Walls are  EVERYWHERE  a minor problem.  And although it exists everywhere, it is especially noticeable in the Mountain Glenn Area  (EDIT: I have not made it back to this area to see if it's been fixed, so it may not be a problem anymore). It is impossible to jump across gaps that should be easily crossed, as well as certain areas in the map where it looks like you should be able to walk through or fall off.    EDIT: This is still an issue but it's less noticeble now unless you go searching for it. They may have changed something behind the scenes.    In conclusion, while I do not regret buying this game, I cannot recommend it in its current state as it still needs a bit of work. I hope that, in time, I will be able to change this review to a 'Recommend'.      From Update #3: I can still say I don't regret buying the game, and Rooster Teeth has been doing a great job on turning this great concept into a great game! If their work continues to be as good as it has been, I can safely say I will be changing the review to 'Recommended' in the near future.     EDIT: This will most likely be the final review edit. Thanks to Rooster Teeth for being willing to put work into the game and turn something that had potential into something that fullfilled it's potential. I still feel like there are minor adjustments that need to be made, but they no longer hamper the enjoyment of the game. Thanks again, RT!   Edit: Updated some points and fixed some grammar.  Edit #2: Volume Controls were fixed.  Edit #3: 'Combat Revision' update was released, as well as another I didn't see at first. This has fixed several problems and I've updated accordingly.  Edit #4: Final fixes to the review.",
