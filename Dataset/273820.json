    "description": "Blast rocks, drill tunnels and force your way through every mountain. At the beginning you have enough time and no major problems. Once the TNT charges are placed you can start the blasting to create the tunnel entrance. The excavated material will be loaded by a shovel dozer on a dump truck and transported to the storage site.",

            "review_text": "The setting of this game is one that really piqued my interest, who would've thought that mining and tunneling in a post-apocalyptic European Union would be so immersive? The main story behind the game, which the developers subtly drop clues and hints about, is that a group of individuals, cloned from the same template, are made to mine and tunnel for one of the many enclaves that emerged from the ruins of a nuclear war on a global scale, in a ragtag prequel to the famous 'metro' series. The gameplay is very symbolic of how we are all trying to burrow ourselves into a little hole to escape the pressures of society. You don't just move rocks - you move hearts. The roar of the machines is the only motivation you need. They're there not just for manual support - they give more approval to you than your boss-bailiff, whom you never meet face-to-face. Your frustrations are almost literally blown away by the satisfaction of moving masses of earth, which is as simple as T...N...T. I was amazed at the concept of using gentically identical clones as manual labourers, and the subtle argument for its' establishment in the workplace portrayed by the game. While I disagree with oligopolistic conglomerates cloning its' own workforce, the game makes a convincing argument for the 'pros' side of the argument.  Oh and P.S., this game is boring. Really boring. You must detonate, pick up, and move gravel until your fingers, eyes, and brain bleed and you have the brain activity of a tomato. If you buy this game, I will call Interpol and notify the international criminal court of your heinous act.  (don't buy it pls)",

            "review_text": "Oh, oh...  I love simulations... Sim Ant, Sim World, Sim City, Sim Life etc.  I had luck, this game was in a bundle so it came quite cheap - but, if you look closer to this simulation you can see that it goes without the merits of the old time simulations that fans of the simulation genre fancy so much. It isn't as bad as some other simulations that were published over the past few years, but still it isn't a good simulation - it lacks the long term motivation thing, that kept us playing Sim City, the novelty of Sim Ant, and the complexity of Sim World and Sim Life.  I even have to ask myself, is this a 'Simulation' in the original sense of the meaning? I had to say: No. It is a 'drive around a site of civil engineering and mining and try out the construction site equipment. I like building machinery, I like tractors - mostly because I grew up on a rural town, were you had those things as 'toys' to play around.   Thus the game fails the descriptor - 'Simulation', at least in the most obvious ways.   And then, is a game that simulates day to day routines of a 'everyday'-job a good thing to simulate? Do you want to be a construction site worker for real (I have been for three years after grammar-school), or a trucker, a farmer or forester? And to what extend do you wish to 'simulate' the job?  If you answer any of this three questions with a denial, this game clearly isn't for you. If you answer just two of those with a no, or say you don't like simplifications on sims - be wary of this game. If you answer all those with yes, or say that you want a casual, simplified sim - you might have a hit here; there are no calculations of quantities required, no structural engineering calculations and no insurances for your workers... so much for the Sim Part of the game ;-)  Since the user base is very limited, I won't recomend the game - though I sometimes might enjoy that kind of 'simplification'...",

            "review_text": "Expect to be mining and tunneling... If you don't like the idea, don't play this. Easy right?  Is it good game? Not in the common sense Is it good simulator? HELL YES Is it worth 10 bucks? Nope, but in bundle or a discount, it is good buy Would I play this for an hour a day? No way, I'd rather take up knitting Would I dig another tunnel? Yes, I think I would.  There are some minor technical issues like wrong texture clipping when frantically moving the camera inside the tunnel or when driving trucks close to some objects, but nothing critical.  Tunnel creation stages  1) Strip mining the entrance Driving in the van and setting up dynamites. Driving model is just HORRIBLE. It does not take too long, so its bearable. But hey, it's not a van driving simulator, right?  2) Cleaning up the debris With an excavator you must load stones onto a truck and then drive with them to dump them. This part actually is not one big 'Physics, what physics?' mess and it's fun to do. Also kinda frustrating, because the rocks are not very cooperative. And again, it does not take very long, just about the right time to do the work  3) Digging the tunnel Last part which is both the most interesting and the most frustrating. From a control room you control the TBM that diggs the tunel. The controlling part of the TBM is complex and requires some practice. Thats the interesting part. But you have to supply the TBM with concrete. Loading the blocks onto a train was difficult at first and was fun to learn it. But then I find out A LOT of LOTS of concrete. For a tunnel of 6 kms you need to load like 7 FULL trains. First train was to learn, second to practice, third to try some cool moves... Fourth started to be tedious.... For a tunnel of length 89 kilometers, I'd have to break something. So how'bout nope....",
