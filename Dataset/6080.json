Thrillville OTR is challenging and offers a wide variety of minigames and tasks while you build and customize many different theme parks. The story is fine, I don't particularly care for it much. A sappy corporate rival park builder is a threat to stealing your visitors and you have to just build better parks and show 'Globo Joy' who's boss.  I personally dislike the high graphics setting because it makes the character models look creepy. I recommend putting graphics down a notch and disabling voice. It gives a more classic feel to it and it also forces you to actually read the dialogue, which I actually rather do. Check this one out. Ten bucks and it's basically 35 games in one. Can't go wrong!",

            "review_text": "Animated cut-scenes looked great but the character sprites in the actual game did not. Their facial expressions were creepy and they constantly repeated lines. The mini games didn't have very good instructions so things didn't make sense. For example the dance mini game didn't really explain what the symbols actually meant and how to hit some of the directions (if that made any sense). Overall, the game is actually very good and addicting. You get to create your character and even name him/her. For some reason children can also manage the theme park. The missions were really well done and it gave me something to do in the park if I got bored. Also, the game uses REAL music instead of music specifically designed for the game. For example they used Natasha Bedingfeild's (I think I misspelled it) Unwritten song and Toby Mac's 'I'll be for You.' The only major problem with this game is the character sprite design and the lack of explanation in the mini games. Keep in mind this is really just a cheap version of Roller Coaster Tycoon with a story line. Granted it is worth $10 and I would recommend this game for you or a friend.",

I personally started with the Original Thrillville (in my opinion, the parks were better in the Original and I favor it because I spent more time on that with my family than Off the Rails.) I still remember my cousin fighting with my mom that I shouldn't play the game because it's rated E10+. Finally my cousin cracked and I played though the original till the last park (which I felt was the worst, mostly do to the fact that it wasn't interesting). While I'd love to relive the original my X-Box (Original) isn't set up and I lost my copy of Thrillville awhile ago. So I had to go with Off the Rails. Now it's not the first time I played Otr, I had it for PS2 and it died (I think I last played it WAY back in 2012). SO to relive Thrillville and all it's awesomeness, I when ahead and bought it. When I open it I had to set the graphs back to crap, not because my computer couldn't take it, but nostalgia.  Tips: 1) Buy the game: Even if you have to steal a car to get this game, it is worth the grand theif charges (JK, don't do it) 2) Whatever you do DON'T PLAY ANY OBJECTIVES: this one may be weird, but to get the true experience you must ♥♥♥♥ around and build whatever you want, I promise anything you build will be a success! 3) Set your graphs to the second worst setting: Unless you played it on the Wii or are used to good graphs set it to ♥♥♥♥! 4) If you do play the objective, you will blow though the whole game in 2 parks: it's that easy to get though this game, but with the rate build most people have you might need that rate! 5) Don't give away any prizes you get unless you're playing the objectives like a moron: just don't. 6) When you build up all the parks THEN do the objectives: but you might find that half of the are done anyway. 7) Play though half of the game before you go into build coster mode 8) If you can get a PS2 control 9) Have a buddy to play with 10) Have another control so they can play 11) Watch Mortimer, the dude is Doc Brown's funny twin! 12) Have fun!",

The only good thing about this game are the minigames. At least some of them are worth playing, they also got a lot more easy, based on PC controls. But it certainly shouldn't cost this much. You'll get as much fun out of this game as I did. But I wouldn't waste your money.",
