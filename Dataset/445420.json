The story is developing very nicely, and I love how the original japanese voice acting is incorporated into it for each of the characters. The subtitles are visually appealing and very well-structured. Definitely a game I would recommend checking out if interested in the Visual Novel &amp; RPG genre.",

            "review_text": "The gameplay isn't bad, but it's quite linear and not really challenging. The plot is okayish, has likeable and unlikeable characters and bad guys are kinda cheezy. I believe that at some points you can actually tell that the story has been forcefully bended a little to make it all-ages. The partial blood / skimpy clothes censorship doesn't help either. And yet, despite all that... it's quite enjoyable if you are into this kind of thing. If you know japanese though, I would recommend going for different version.",
