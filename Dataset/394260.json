    "description": "What if dancing could save the world? In Dance Magic, it can. What if scientists invented a brand new form of biological energy able to convert dancing moves to real power? Then the fate of the whole human race would depend on the most skilled dancerâ€™s will. Do not let this energy be used for destruction!",
