There is alot of content missing from this version of the game, the contols are odd and this has to be the buggiest version I have ever seen. I encourage you to buy this game and the other two of the series, but do yourself a favor and pay just a little bit more for the disk, this version is not worth the money.",

But in return, I got a shi*** game that I barely played 30 minutes, due to impossibility to grab a lubricant.The loupe was missing too.  That evening made my week even worse. Don't touch this game! It's a blatant robbe**. ( It's Thursday, November 17th and the game is still broken).",

Stop taking peoples money if you don't even bother fixing issues the game has!  (SPOILER)  In my case, I was in a room where you escaped from the first vampire bat you meet on the second floor. I first got stuck in the fireplace view after I picked up a nail and didn't see the poker you were suppose to pickup too, so I quit the game then went back and now I can't pick up that poker in the fireplace or the nail since it's already in my inventory even though you can still see it in the fireplace.",
