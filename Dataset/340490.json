Using nothing but your wits and your skills you must gain supplies, craft equipment and escape the city before you too fall to the mutation.  This game is fantastic, a top down shooter with survival elements, a persistent open world and an interesting setting. You would be silly to pass this one up. I had so much fun exploring the vast city whilst dodging mutants and managing supplies. All the while building my armoury and keeping Albert alive and healthy.   There is so much to offer here that you will have hours of enjoyment, randomly generated levels, beautifully crafted world, huge amount of weapons, craftables and enemies. The interesting bare bones story drops you off in centre of an abandoned city with only one goal, survival, and it doesnâ€™t hold your hand as you go about it. I can recommend this game anyday as its well worth your time.  Have Fun ^_^",

I highly recommend this title.",

Subterrain is a rare standout amongst many unremarkable games out there.  Sci-fi horror story with tension-wracked decision making as you struggle to balance exploration, resource management, time management, choosing item research paths, and even some good old tower defense thrown in! Who could ask for more than that?  I've had some very scary moments playing this game (especially on Hardcore+ difficulty with permadeath option). As the infection spreads you truly feel the urgency of being smothered with fewer and fewer options unless you make good decisions fast. It's a nail biter!  Much praise to Pixellore. You put together many different gaming genres in a smooth package.  As a footnote: Fans of Subterrain may also enjoy Dungeon of the Endless in their gaming library.",

            "review_text": "It's basically if Project Zomboid and DOOM had a top-down baby. And no, it's not as kinky as it sounds, but the game is hella bomb and that is pretty much all that matters. Finally beginning to dump some time into the game and it is a great simulation of survival in what feels like a derelict space craft. Think of the movie Pandorum (which is great btw). There is a vast amount of weapons and weapon types in the game. You can shoot the BFG, wield a lightsaber, or use more realistic weapons such as ballistic rifles and pistols. You have to manage your survival stats, such as hunger, thirst, and even if you have to take dump, however they remain more minor elements to keep gameplay fresh, not crippling features where you cry as you look for your next water bottle as you're dehydrated. Surprised this game hasn't gotten more hype, if you see it on sale, GET IT! If you like Project Zomboid, DEFINITELY get it, and if you don't get both!  You have a main base in the old control module and there you have different sets of equipment for refining or recycling items, constructing new equipment, researching items and upgrades, a massive generator which you need tro protect from mutant invasions (No power, no air, no thermal regulations, and most importantly, no more ammo) with multiple turrets you can set up around it. You play as Dr. West, a man that was sentenced to prison as a murderer due to a lab accident. You start the game with nothing, only your prison coveralls, and slowly build up gear on your way back to the control center, were you hope there will be people. Once there, you have to manage the global infection rate by going on monster hunts essentially and killing ones that have spawned. You can also almost stop the rate in areas that you choose to provide power too, once you've rebuilt the oxygen filters and thermal regulators. The infection spreads fastest when it is cold and there is no air. If it builds too high, you can be attacked and hae to defend your base. The generator is damaged and slowly degrades, you have to either research one of the generator cores to make more, or repair it in your nano reconstruction bay (which starts only at 50% max amount but can be upgraded) Really if you're still reading, just watch a gameplay video and buy it. It is an amazing game and crazy for being developmed (I'm pretty sure) by one guy.",

            "review_text": "I got this game as a christmas present after having marked it as 'Not interested' when it came up on my explore list. I am glad to say I was very wrong about not being interested.  The game does a great job at keeping you very aware of the time pressure, you're constantly looking for food, water, medicine and useful materials to recycle. All the while preventing suffocation, freezing to death or letting the infection get too high (both in your own body and on the game map). And that doesn't take the local wildlife into account, which is plentiful and quite diverse. One of them is pretty harmless, were it not for the fact it opens doors, sometimes swamping you with a horde of flailing mutant limbs.  The interface isn't all that intuitive, but if you read all the help topics before starting (the intro tells you most things, but some at the wrong times) you'll figure it out soon enough. The game isn't easy though, my first few games were failures, but what I learnt from them helped me be more successful in later games.  Playing this makes my heart race and my palms sweat, so bad I occasionally need a break, but I'm certainly having a blast.",

            "review_text": "A very underrated and overlooked game, that i find a true masterpiece, a gem in a massive pile that are indie survival horrors. A very detailed and developed aspects of survival system, managing your base power and integrity, trying to slow down infection rates spreading across the map, manage heating and oxygen supplies(it is a mars base afterall). Massive amount of stuff to craft and research, using the base's mining facilites, bio farms, engineering centers, etc. Very dynamic background system - just watching the map from your base, you can imagine just how much bad â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is happening outsite. Lore and atmosphere are fantastic, you can fully immerse yourself in the game. It also has story and goals to achieve, so while you can play endless, its not one of those games that just throws you in endless survival for no reason, thankfully.  If you're a fan of survival horrors, especially non linear ones, where you have your own 'safe' upgradeable base and have to venture for stuff, then its a must have for you. The developer have also proved to be very supportive and still keeps making big updates after the game's release.",

            "review_text": "LOVE the art and a lot of the game play, so much so I want to keep re-opening the game, but.  I've not even left the main level after the initial train journey and I didn't realise I needed to sacrafice things to research them, so I used both decontamination pills and now don't know how to make them both in terms of components and what to do to fabricate them if I can work out what components I need and actually get them.  I've taken the approach of looking for items religously returning to the base and storing them in a room, ready to craft with. But now I have 100's of items across 10 or 15 containers and find myself constantly looking in containers to see what I have. Sorting items feels like a chore. Is there no way to search?  I've read some help and tuts but I get the string impression that if I try hard I may get out of the base, only to find that becuase I have taken a slow, methodical approach the infection rate will mean I have hardcore enemies to deal with. So taking my time damages my ability to progress, not encouraging.  I feel VERY bad for sitting here typing negative things about a beautifull creation, I just feel frustrated that a game with SO much going for it is [for me] unplayable.  If a 'lite' version was done, i.e. some layers of complexity removed so less things that might feel repetative and the game feeling less unwinable, I would buy it again and love it.  Thanks for all the amazing art and lots of the gameplay and atmostphere and if there is ever a beta I might like then I'd love to hear about it.",
