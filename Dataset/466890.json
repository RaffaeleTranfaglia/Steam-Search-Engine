            "review_text": "This is the WORST game I have ever seen on Steam, period. I saw the trailer which truly expanded what I knew to be possible about bad Steam Greenlight games, so I bought it to check and see how bad it got. (I have since refunded this game. Don't worry.)    There are two weapons in this game - an assault rifle and a rocket launcher. The rocket launcher has no animation when fired. You pull the trigger and see an explosion happen. There is no way to tell when, how, or if the enemies are attacking you. There are things in the environment that will make you curious only to insta kill you for approaching them, without warning or explanation. The level design is unexplainably bland - open ground and corridors full of reused assets - that's it. It is unintentionally creepy due to an eerie lack of music. I won't even mention the nearly nonexistant story. What would you expect from the shovelware Greenlight garbage that floods the store these days?  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.   Unless you're intention is to show yourself and your friends the absolute depths of lazy design that a game can achieve in the modern day, STAY FAR, FAR AWAY.  PS - I am aware that this game was created from start to finish by just one person. Good for him! That's awesome. Keep working on your trade. However, you have absolutely no business selling your half-baked practice games on Steam.",

            "review_text": "Devs, did you even playtest this thing? THE GOOD: Gun textures look nice, theme is cool. THE BAD: Jagged terrain, empty and boring landscapes, annoying looping music, enemies clip through some walls, player clips through some walls, inconsistent sounds (footsteps, guns, etc.), pop ins, texture flickering, gaps where textures join, the list goes on and on. From the screenshots, it looks like it might be ok. It's really not. I don't mean to ♥♥♥♥ on a game for no reason but it seems like the devs legitimately did not even try to make this game look or play half decent.",
