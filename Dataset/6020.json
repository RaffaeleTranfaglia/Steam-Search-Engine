As you can tell by my recorded hours on Steam alone (add about another 1400 or so), I've played this game for a little bit. The lightsaber combat is, hands down, only matched (maybe slightly bested) by its predecessor Jedi Outcast. The gunplay, is okay, but come on, this game is called JEDI ACADEMY for a reason! The Force powers add a ridiculous angle to the gameplay in both Single and Multiplayer to keep things from getting too stale. The community for JKA is one of the most resilient communities I have encountered, they have stuck by this game for the 10+ years that this game has been around, and doesn't show too many signs of fizzling out. If you happen to be a fan of Star Wars, I would recommend buying this game, as well as Jedi Outcast, and playing the hell out of them!",

In fact I remember my first ever clan was {SnJ} back in 2003, and their server is still up and running now.. crazy. (10.06.15)  Insanely addictive saber combat, simple to pickup and play. Easily in my top 10 games of all time! Purchase this game, you must..  EDIT(25.10.15): A huge shame to hear about the termination of  JK3Files.com  network. A truly wonderful site and will be hugely missed. There is a dedicated website that has all files mirrored if anybody is on the hunt to pick up mods once more, also a great community named JKHub that contains lots of files and information too.",

            "review_text": "For those of you that hate reading, there's a condensed version of my rambling at the bottom of the paragraph.   Thought I'd write a review for this game but, the hours I have invested in it speak for me in all honesty. This game is the epitome of my STAR WARS wet dreams. Custom Jedi, Lightsabers, The Force, and Stormtrooper dismemberment; what more could you ask for? The story campaign is really good and provides a good time for everyone. Luke Skywalker is voiced by Mark Hamill and John Williams' original STAR WARS score plays throughout the entire game. The fanservice levels in this game are just literally off the charts! However, where this game really shines, in my opinion, is the mods. This game becomes ten times better once you start sinking mods into it. The moding for this game is super easy and definitely add to the experience once you've done all you can with the vanilla game. The mod that gave me over 400 hours by itself was the MOVIE BATTLES II multiplayer conversion mod. I personally believe the MOVIE BATTLES II mod is the best possible mod to get for this game as it is regularly updated and transforms the battle mechanics of the game completely to make it feel like a more realistic STAR WARS experience. And that is just one of the thousands of mods for this game floating around the internet.  So in short, game by itself is great. The Story is ok and the STAR WARS fanservice is seemingly endless. Game with mods is fantastic, tons of mods that add the experience in many different ways. Highly recommend this game for any person who has ever wanted to swing a lightsaber.",

From vehicles in the desert to iconic music and locations, this game has it all. Explore the wonders of the Force as you learn the ways of the Jedi, then abandon it all for the true power: GUNS. That annoying sith warrior keeps killing you? Bomb him to oblivion, Stormtoopers? Shoot them with bigger guns. It works to certain extent, but guns are no match to the higher level sith warriors you face late game. It's just great and so refreshing to have the option to use different weapons. :) Enter Darth Vader's castle in Vjun ad fight your way through.Then feel like a badass when you finally get good with the lightsaber. Combat is amazing and truly evokes the feeling of being a Jedi. It brought up a constant feeling of wonder. Temples, deserts, forests, space stations, frozen wastes. The galaxy is yours to explore as you complete missions on your way to earn the title of Jedi Knight. This is a great game and I enjoyed it very much. I hope that we can see a new entry in this series soon. If you like Star Wars, this is a must. If you're an RPG fan like me, this is grade A right here.",

This game was very much my life, my source of satisfaction and very much needed escapism, for the most formative years of my life.  I nominated Jedi Academy for the 'Test of Time' Award because, as of November 2016, there still isn't a game that comes anywhere close to the complexity, depth, spectacle and accessibility of its lightsaber combat. There's a good reason that people spent years learning the intricacies of a single lightsaber loadout, let alone the other two (two sabers, and dual-ended) and the three styles (Fast, Medium, Strong) of each. This game is astonishing because of how fantastic its combat remains.  I mean, it's also got everything else going for it - enjoyable, memorable maps; distinct, unique Force powers; a delightfully cheesy campaign with surprising twists and turns; a great rhythm and sense of pacing; thousands upon thousands of mods...  To me, this is as good as Star Wars games get when it comes to the action genres. There hasn't been anything like it since then. It's very much a product of its time, with the freeform multiplayer, open singleplayer levels, a vaguely Quake-esque undercurrent tinting the game's combat and flow, and more. But looking beyond the sentimental attachment I have to it, Jedi Academy remains the epitome of third person melee combat, and as such, it fully deserves the 'Test of Time' Award.",

I could go on and on about this game, but honestly if you know a bit of the EU enough to tolerate most of the characters in the game, pick it up.

Jedi Academy is a classic. The game features the best lightsaber combat system in all Star Wars games. There are hundreds of mods, even for the singeplayer experience. Both multiplayer and singeplayer are great. However, there are no brazilian servers, so its kinda hard to play with 180 MS for the poeple who live in Brazil like me. I think you should definetly buy this game, especially if you are a Star Wars fan. Many references to the movies, comics and expanded universe here. Dont think twice, especially if it's on sale.

The main plot of the game unfolds and changes depending on decisions you make toward the end of the game.  In addition, the multiplayer is still alive and challenging. Learning the different saber combos and styles to kill other players is still as rediculously hard and fun as it was back when this game came out.

            "review_text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The lightsaber combat is amazing, i'd even venture to say the best ever seen. First of all you can decide between 3 different lightsabers: Single saber, Dual sabers, and Double bladed saber. I recommend you try all of them and look at guides to see which one fits your playstyle. Second of all, The reason the lightsaber combat is so good is because its very accurate to how a Jedi would fight. You see, Jedi look slightly into the future when they fight , thats why they are so good at fighting. And how could you incorporate this into a players hand (who is probably not precognitive)? Auto-Block. The perfect solution. You block most things, but enemys can get through it by battering your defenses enough, or cleverly useing the environment and Force powers to get around it. This brings me to another point, the Force. Any Jedi or Sith should have this at his disposal, or else you are nothing more than a Sith brawler. A good amount of Force powers, 4 unique to the Light side, 4 unique to the Dark side, and 4 available to both. I wont go indepth with the force powers, mainly because there are guides explaining that, and of course you can train offline with them to see what fits you. Enough of that, hows the story? Well i wont spoil anything, but the story is about the New Republic. And you are Jaden Korr, a talented young force sensitive person who built his lightsaber BEFORE his training. The story gives you a Light &amp; Dark choice throughout, for 2 different endings depending on what you decided. So yes, the story was enjoyable, although since this is the beginning of mouth-movement in cinematics and it looks very clunky, but thats part of its charm. Now, what about blasters? Yes blasters are in this, and they can be very good if used correctly. Although deflecting a blaster shot back at enemy and watching them get thrown backwards is oh so satifying, you have to be careful of those blasters, especially the sniper one. it'll get you from across the map. Blasters are deadly if used right is my point. And they add a bit of spice to gameplay! My final verict: A MUST OWN for any Star Wars fan or Dueling fan, as long as you're not the kind of person that cant stand lower than normal graphics this is your game, 8/10",

I love the lightsaber mechanics and how the saber burns everything it touches, making each kill different in a really cool way.   The only downside I can think of is character customization. I'd love if some more races and character skins were available.  If you're looking for some really satisfying and creative Jedi combat, I highly suggest purchasing this game.

            "review_text": " Excellent game.   Ever wanted a star wars game where you can play as an FPS or third person hack and slash. Well look no further cause this is the game for you. Star wars Jedi knight: Jedi academy is the fourth game in the jedi knight series. The campaign sets you up as a student of the new jedi academy run by Master Luke Skywalker. You basically complete missions while also trying to figure out the motives of a mysterious sith cult. There are over 20 missions available.  Gameplay involves intense combat, some platforming and puzzle solving. You start of with a light sabre and limited force powers. As you play, you will unlock new sabres, weapons and force powers. The lightsabre combat looks amazing, especially when you face the sith guys (really flashy). Other weapons include: Rifles, sniper, rockets, shotgun, grenades and pistol. Each weapon has a secondary fire mode such as scope, grnade launcher, charged shot, auomatic fire etc. You have limited ammunition available for guns and will need to restock via containers or looted from corpses. With each mission you complete you can select a new force power to level up/learn. You can only choose light and dark force powers to learn and upgrade, with the neutral powers upgrading naturally as you progress though the story. Besides the sith, you also face other foes such as stormies, jet troopers, thugs, rancor and wampas.  The level design is amazing. Each mission you do, sets you in a unique place with different objectives available. The level of detail of the levels are great as there are plenty space to move around and secrets to find.  The sound is also good. Besides the awesome star wars soundtrack that we are accustomed to from the movies, the voice acting in this game is good as well.   Besides the single player campaign, there is also a multiplayer mode available. In multiplayer you and 15 other players face off in arenas. Everyone has lightsabres and a few guns. There are also bots available (up to 15) that you can play with should the multiplayer be dead (which unfortunately it is). You can choose a large variety of characters to play as/face off including stormies, boba fett, Luke etc. Furthermore, you can customise you lightsabre colour, hilt, fighting style (dual, single, attached sabres) as well as force powers. There are a variety of game modes including: deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag. In the arenas, you can find power ups, health packs as well as new guns to play with.  I highly recommend this game for fans or star wars or people who want good hack and slash game. Worth every cent.",

            "review_text": "I'll start with the biggest strength: There is no better series/game for a free flowing lightsaber/force power action game, past or present. Battlefront and Force Unleashed were the closest in the Star Wars universe and others have tried in other universes with similar concepts but none of them touch the feel of this game in my opinion. I have played them all extensively and I still come back to this one when I really want to swing a saber and throw some fools off a ledge with Grip or Lightning. The movement and Force Powers all feel just right and the varied move sets based on saber stances/styles are endlessly adaptable to make for a unique fight every time - or you can find one trick you love and use it till your fingers grow arthritic.  That brings me to the second strongest aspects: It was one of the first games to successfully implement environment running once you level up a bit (aka Jedi parkour). You can hop around, wall run, and just generally be a badass both in and out of fights. The missions are all in unique locations that capture the feel of the universe and provide unique experiences. The graphics and physics have held up well all things considered - at the time they were incredible. That isn't to say there aren't flaws, but nothing game breaking that I have found and generally lots of fun.  The biggest weakness: The story line is a bit predictable but I honestly don't care one tiny bit. The general idea and delivery is good enough for me. If you are expecting something that will cause you to do some serious soul searching, this is probably not going to be the place to find it, but there are two endings for a bit of variety.  Overall I would strongly recommend this game because it delivers on what it tries to deliver on - great gameplay in a fast paced lightsaber/force using environment with a million different ways to approach any fight.",

You get your ightsaber from the start and have a decent amount of customization.

It takes skill, took me a couple of hours to learn how to use a Lightsaber properly without getting killed instantly. If you're planning on playing the Multiplayer in this game but you're not good at using lightsabers I highly recommend you downloading the 'Movie Battles 2' mod. It has a lot of the characters from Star Wars in it, you can play as clone/Storm troopers, Bounty hunters, droids, Jedi and Sith etc... And it has some nice character customization.

            "review_text": "This game is a classic, one of the best Star Wars games ever made. You play as Jaden Korr starting off as a Jedi Padawan and as you play through the game you become a Jedi Knight or Master, the game is based along the same storyline as the Dark Forces games and like the Dark Forces games it's based after the Galactic Civil War between the Rebelion and the Galactic (Sith) Empire of course if you've seen the movies you'll know the Rebels win and they form The New Republic, because of how few Jedi are left and there are even less Jedi Masters some students were asigned more than one master, Jaden and another Jedi Padawan Rosh Penin under the jedi master Kyle Katarn. The story says you are a Human Male but you can chose to be a Kel Dor male, a Rodian Male, a Female Human, Twi'lek and Zabrak changing your race doesn't change how you sound, you will always have one of two voices, aswell as that you can customize your lightsaber, this game has the second best or the best lightsaber customization to Star Wars Galaxies, again the story says Jaden has a purple lightsaber but you can change the colour if you want, but in singleplayer he can't have a red lightsaber, you can also choose from a few handles for each saber, one is the saber Anikan uses and another is the one Obi Wan uses, aswell as a single saber you can use duel sabers and a saber stalf saber stalfs have their own unique handles too, chosing duel sabers or a saber stalf over a single saber does seem cool but the single sabers are more flexible with three attack modes, light medium and heavy each with their strengths and weaknesses. The story of the Dark Forces games is probably one giant 'What If' scenario, what if Anakin didn't wipe out all the Jedi in the temple what if he missed a few and they escaped? even though irionically his son Luke, (with the help of his badass buddy Kyle Katarn) trains these people to (most likely) become amazing jedi.  Like most to all jedi-themed classic Star Wars games you can chose to be good or bad, i will not explain in this review for spoiler reasons how to chose your side and how it will end. Multiplayer is very much like Quake 3 only with three types of grenades, the ability to use the force and customize your lightsaber and of course you can chose a red blade. Like Quake 3 you can chose from a large nomber of characters from the Dark Forces games even people you don't see in Jedi Academy aswell as your own characters, the character creation is exactly the same as in singleplayer. You can chose to be focused arround dark side powers or light side powers not both, each side has their own unique team power in the team-based games, some powers act differently to how they do in singleplayer and you can have power 'loadouts' making it easier to change power builds. There are six game modes, Deathmatch, TDM, Duel, Power Duel, Capture the Flag and a class based Siege gamemode. Deathmatch and TDM are basically the same as always, your cloths and saber is coloured based on what team you are on and in TDM you can chose to have it light powers vs dark powers, the first team to hit the score limit or the team with the most score when the time runs out wins. Duel is also very self explanatory, a good old 1-on-1 battle Power Duel is 2-on-1 but the person by himself gets a few advantiges to even things out, you can chose to have weapons or go lightsaber only, lightsaber only is probably the best choice for duels since there aren't any weapons or powerups inside the arena, the person who hits the win limit or has the most wins... well wins. Capture the flag is what it always has been, if you've played Quake 2, 3, any Untral Torunament or Metal Techs 4 through to 7 (the Tribes games) you'll know what it is, like all team gmaes in Jedi Academy and most team-based games/gamemodes there are two teams. In Siege there is an attacking team and a defending team. The attackers have to make their way through the base and the defenders have to stop this, i havn't played much of siege persenally but i know that it has vehicles and it's class based with no AI, vehicles and mounted guns. Also you don't have to have a lightsaber in Multiplayer for those who want a little bit of an extra chalange, and play agenst players since the AI aren't that smart even on the Jedi Master difficulty.  If your Star Wars dream was to become a Jedi i hightly reccomend this game aswell as that it's an awesome game in general, there aren't many Star Wars gems like this anymore since EA owns the rights to the Star Wars games so we must enjoy the few we have left.",

Combat is very much 'go with the flow' and the only thing I can really fault is the Jedi Sense power, which comes across as a gimmick rather than sensing anything through the Force.  My issue with this game is Kyle Katarn and the fact his involvement becomes so special, the whole reason a final boss wants to squash you is to turn him to the Dark side. Now, I love him in his visual novels and understand he was the protagonist of the last games. As a writer, I have trouble understanding why you would decide to exclude him as the player character because he was too powerful and then centring Jaden Korr’s storyline him. The main character comes off as a distraction at best in their game, and it's quite discordant with the flow of the game.  I still recommend buying it as the Star Wars feel, lightsaber, powers and fights are centred through you and the gameplay easily makes up for story weaknesses along with an added multiplayer but this game has limited appeal outside Star Wars fans.

When I stumbled across this in steam it brought back a wave of memories , back when I was 11 or 12 and used to play the demo of this game on my dad's computer. I bought it on steam, expecting it to be not as good as a I remembered, as are a lot of my childhood games I go back to.   However I was hugely surprised to find it every bit as good as I remembered. Graphics arent half bad given their age, lightsaber combat is fun and fairly varied, force powers are useful and satisfying, maps are well laid out. All in all a pretty decent game. My only complaints are lack of compass or mini map means it often takes ages to figure out where you're meant to be going, and after a while the earlier missions get a tad repetitive, combined with the very slow and sparse story telling. The story/plot is the weakest aspect of the game, but its still great fun for a light saber hacky slashy trip down memory lane.  Having just completed both endings I now find myself unwilling to leave the star wars universe just yet, so am presently downloading KOTOR :)  Definitely worth a play if you are even vaguely interested in star wars, as I'm not a massive fan but still enjoyed it a lot.

The combat is smooth and exciting - getting a chain of force power attacks punctuated by a final light sabre stab is as entertaining today as it was in 2003. It also now has the benefit of modern keyboards and mice, with the extra buttons allowing for a much more fluid use of force powers, now easily accessible at your fingertips rather than awkwardly occupying the function keys. The singleplayer is a fantastic smattering of vastly different mission types that will see you infiltrating, platforming, puzzle solving, piloting, rescuing and investigating. Your force powers grow in strength after each mission, and when you finally get a real taste of freedom it doesn't take long before you feel like the ultimate badass. Unlike many modern games, Jedi Academy actually lets you enjoy this feeling for a few missions before finally ramping up the difficult to an incredibly challenging and fun last third.  If you've not played it and want some well-aged action, you could do a lot worse than this. There's also a dedicated and friendly modding community.",

You earn new force powers dark or light to unleash on your foes. Multi-player is the best. You can play as a jedi and take on oter people in epic light saber fights. It also has a huge mod community.

Its really great game play in the story mode I think it has a good story line but I do think they should have given more background on these three character, Rosh, Kyle, and Tavion. Now I love how you can choose between a gun and a lightsaber but most of the time I prefer a saber :). The one thing that I have problems with is multiplayer. I'm sure when it works its super fun but when I try to work multiplayer its horrible. What happens to me is that I put in a server address then I press 'Done' and then its searches it forever. I have no idea whats up with that maybe its the version of windows I have which is 8 but if that's the case I'm waiting for my windows ten to be ready for me but if that's not the reason I don't know what is, and could someone please give me some pointers. Over all I would defiantly recommend this game for anyone who's a gamer and loves star wars (If you don't like star wars then DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME plus I will hunt you down and kill u in your sleep :D)",

But throughout the game, besides learning a whole lot of different skills you're also free to select which side of the force suits you better. The best thing about this game (in my modest opinion) is that you already begin with your saber, which is infinitely better than those awful blasters. The multiplayer mode is also extremely fun and I've played for countless hours even before acquiring this Steam version. Overall, go ahead and may the force be with you.",

Okay, don't get me wrong- I love a nice, meaty campaign. But the campaign for this game was just...not that interesintg. It was predictable, unexciting, and just felt forced.  However, back to the screweing around. I discovered this game's cheat cosole on my second playthrough of the game. That day, the only thing I took a break for was lunch and dinner. Legit. And, even without cheats, you can just screw around and have a generally great time. Plus, the mechanics never get old, making this perfect. I still haven't gotten tired of seeing someone on a speeder go spiralling into a canyon about 70 hours of gametime later.  And then there's the modding. And, my God, is there modding.  I have spent hours scrolling through Moddb and other websites to find mods for this game, each of which has met up to its expectations. About 30 hours of gametime ago, I discovered Movie Battles 2. This basically creates a whole new game and a whole new meta that I could make about five freakin' reviews about. However, let's stick to JKA.  Pros: Fun and intuitive mechanics Hours of fun from just screwing around with the cheats console Mod support Great nerdy fun overall  Cons: Graphics are meh Story is kinda sucky Multiplayer sucks  My verdict: 10/10.

Even thougt you can run alongside the walls and use really powerfull force powers only a bit later in the game, it´s worth it.

This is a Star Wars game were you really get to feel how it is to be a Jedi knight. With plenty of cameos from old and new characters alike, it is a fitting finale to the Jedi Knight series. Without doubt one of the best games from Lucasart.  ... and it never get old to force grip enemies and gently relese them over a chasm hehe.",

Really well balanced, makes you use your brain with some small puzzles, you might get stuck sometimes, unfortunately, but simple enough for you to get through. Good lightsabre battles and gameplay, really simple, easy to pick up and play. Can also be challenging but also can be easy (difficulty is selectable when you create your character). Highly recomend.",
