Really good game if it wasn't for a bunch of bugs, mainly:  -Game crashing on the final boss every time we fought it (about 5 separate attempts) -Enemies with aoe attacks stuck inside walls -Upgrades mysteriously vanishing after a few minutes from being picked up  Still fun, but damn is it frustrating not being able to beat the game because of crashes.",

Players take control of one or more of a group of five soldiers out to take back their steampunk city from its tyrannical ruler and his army of mutants and magic-fuel powered machines. The game combines fast-paced twin stick shooting with tough as nails roguelike elements and has very tight and fluid combat. The graphics are amazing, the enemies are varied and fun to kill, and the boss fights are suitably intense.  My only real complaint so far is that the music is somewhat repetitive.",

            "review_text": "Rogue Stormers is a 2D Platform Shooter; picture Bionic Commando with dieselpunk elements... and alot of goblins.  I've been following this game since its alpha state; the devs are hard at work trying to tune it just right and it sincerely has come its way.  You can play as various dieselpunk-ish soldiers/knights, each with its own strengths, along with various weapons and skills. The controls aren't clear at first, but video games have been growing towards tutorials and controller scheme loading screens, so i'll look at it as a challenge. Once you get a hang of it, it plays just fine.  Visually, the game is at its best. The graphics are distinct and the scenario is great. The various propaganda around the levels, depicting a mysterious goo-like substance adds a charm i don't often see in video games.  DieselStormers greatest strength lies in Co-op. Everything's better with a friend. Or two. Ok, you can play it with 3 more buddies and a good time is guaranteed. You can even laugh together at its occasional bugs WHICH aren't bad as far as Early-Access games go. They are Early-Access for a reason.  Altogether, I think it's worth a try, especially if you're looking for something to tackle with your friends.  Oh, and it has this weird taxi squid. Dude.",

Random Generated Challenging levels . I love procedural generated game , that give you surprise and replayability . Although it might upset for the play who prefer storyline campaign , but , if you like story, you could watch a movie , what a game really needs are surprise and replayability.  3. Online multiplayer!! Have fun to coop with your friends !",

            "review_text": "The game is pretty fun, it almost feels like the binding of issac.  - Map layout changes for each new game. -7 levels - Plenty of perks and able to stack them much as you want, through purchasing them from shops or unlocking chest - Unqiue special abilitiy for each character and able to pick up special weaponary that uses a meter, which refills. - Fun boss fights -60 Permament character leveling upgrades VS the perks you lose everytime you start a new a game, which makes the game more enjoyable and easier each time you play it.  I haven't beaten the game yet, but the only thing I can really tell you, which dissapoints me about this game is the lack of online play. The servers are empty, no ones is playing online, so if your considering buying this game for multiplayer you should grab a couple of buddies to jump on the bandwagon with ya.",
