            "review_text": "Selenon Rising leaves me with a feeling of 'nearly there.' The characters are interesting, engaging, and easy to identify with. The character art is suitably attractive and expressive. The music is atmospheric and follows the action well. The setting and story are both very intriguing. The interview mechanic was challenging and fun: the 'correct' solution was not always obvious, but always made sense in hindsight. Selenon Rising has a lot going for it, but stumbles in places as well. Some of the transitions are a little awkward, some of the scenarios not adequately set up. This was mostly an issue early on, and the payoff for sticking with the game is pretty good. The price seems right so far, maybe a little steep for the amount of content in episode 1. Value for money will depend a lot on whether subsequent episodes will be released free, at a reduced price, or at the same price. A demo, perhaps including the early Grange scenario, could encourage interest since it is difficult to communicate what the game is really about without one.",
