I miss those days even if they were shameless reasons to make you buy games.  This game has bad reviews for a reason. I wasted hours trying to get that achievement and never did. It was impossible to keep enough people together and my biggest issue was the exponetially increasing respawn rate. die once, 20 seconds, okay, 40 seconds, um, alright, 80 seconds, seriously, 160 second, what the, 320, ARE YOU KIDDING ME. trust me, after multiple attempt for one silly achievement it getss annoying.   The game has little depth, boring combat and was barely worth playing even with good friends. don't ever buy this crap. Even if it's free. well, maybe if it's free and you want to punish yourself.",

I found that most of the time there were so many projectiles being shot at you and with the horrible hit detection made the game frustrating to play. The screen regularly lags with too many things happening on the screen despite having a computer that more than could manage it. In retrospect had I not gotten caught up in the winter event I would never have bought this game, which is a deep regret.",

This game literally has no balance between single player and multiplayer, the game will always assume that there are 4 people playing and therefore the game will always scale towards 4 people. This makes single player survival pretty much impossible, not only that, but the gameplay itself is monotonous and utterly trivial. The special ability of each character is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will get you killed almost every time. The entire game mechanics is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. The only few useful guns in this entire game is the laser gun, rifle, chain gun, and one gun that shoot sparkly missiles. You don’t regenerate health, mob variety is ok, but their artificial intelligence is laughable at best. Save your money and don’t buy this disgrace of an indie game. It is very unlikely that my review of this game will change after I beat the campaign.",
