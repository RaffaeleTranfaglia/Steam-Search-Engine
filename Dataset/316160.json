            "review_text": "I have completed this game already so ignore my play time. Great game, interesting story. The controlls are a little bit irritating but I think they did a good job following on from number 3 and continuing broken sword in 3D. In fact I think this one is better then number 3. The game throws your straight into the action and keeps up a good thrilling pace throughout. The only frustration I have is that the mouse does not always indicate a spot you can interact with, like a lader. Also without a tutorial some people can become confused about all the actions you can perform and get stuck, for instance right clicking and selecting a certain action to be able to proceed. However, once you have got used to these small issues the game is a very rewarding experience and another great chapter in the broken sword series. The voice acting is as always top notch. I highly recommend this game.",

I found no way to skip conversations or video scenes, so replaying certain bits became tiring.  I had to follow all advice for making this game run like less butt - see the forums for help.  Still recommended.",
