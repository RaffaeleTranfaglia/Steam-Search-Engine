            "review_text": "Being a big fan of Giants Software's Farming Simulator series, I was very curious about Ski Region Simulator when I first saw it. Being Canadian, you just have to love snow, or at least like it, if you're to remain sane living here. A love of skiing might be something you'd think of useful of this game, but you won't be snapping your boots into those bindings and shred the slopes in Whistler or Blackcomb. You get to manage a ski resort with some pretty detailed aspects of the whole business. You start off with just 2 stations which are connected by a ski slope, and you need to ensure there's enough powder there and that it's groomed just right, which is a bit hard packed for my taste, but it's not back-country heli skiing in deep powder. There are helicopters flying around, the rescue kind, but you don't get to fly them, only bring the 'injured' skiers from some of the missions to the helipad for medivac. You get to buy more ski stations, from small to very large ones, which cost more based on their size. Own the stations at either end of a ski slope and you own it. Then you get to build small to large support buildings all over the mountain, and these include from a simple Tourist Information outlet, to full size Conference Halls, Spa Retreats, Movie Theaters, and so on. You get to choose what kind of service is offered in each building, which have a few selections for each one. The trick is to cover all demographics of your guests/clients, and the game has some nice statistical breakdowns to help you manage your resort. Young, Adult, Young Senior, Family, Single, Couple, Romantic, Party, Business, poor, middle-class, rich, and so on. Lots of info and details to manage day to day, even hour to hour. And of coure, the best part! You get to drive all kinds of heavy machinery and 'play' in the snow. All in all I'm really enjoying this Giants title, and the Gold edition includes both DLC packs. Also, there's some mods available, but not many. I think the best mods for the game have been made, and still being made, by Don Chris which can be found here: (Apparently posting a link in your review is considred 'spamming'.) So let me try to cheat here by masking the website for you. donchris.jimdo dot com All in all I'm very happy with this game and glad I finally decided to buy it.",

            "review_text": "'Makes me wanna own and operate.' 7/10  I've scored many games in many bundles over the last year, and I must say that I couldn't be happier with this one in particular. 'Ski Region Simulator' is exactly what you'd expect out of a simulation game. It's relaxing, it's not very challenging, it works perfectly with a controller, and it offers just enough variety and just enough incentive to keep itself interesting for a good four or five hours, at least. Giving you some money and a dream, 'Ski Region' gives you the tools and the talent to take a single trail and turn it into a massive ski empire. And I'm not sure about you, but personally, I've always wanted to build my very own highly successful virtual ski resort. I guess somebody out there was listening.  It's not an easy road though, as you scratch and claw your way to the very top of the premiere ski resort league, and many obstacles will surely get in your hair before the journey is through. Maintaining trails, transporting injured skiers, and other various tasks such as moving salt, and adjusting daily prices occur throughout a busy ski day and it's now your responsibility to take care of the minutia. Buy trails, hire help, and build businesses such as restaurants, schools, day-care centers, and more as you repay your loan to the bank and gain a reputation as a world class ski resort operator.   And let's not forget about the vehicles like snowmobiles, tractors, and other things that are fun to drive around in the snow, messing with the trails that you hope to own some day. So like I said, this game is pretty relaxing, and if you're not looking for a challenge, then it's easy to burn a few hours trying to build a successful resort. And ten dollars is a really fair price as well, considering how well the game works with a controller and the overall quality; although the graphics are somewhat dated. 'Ski Region Simulator' is easily one of the better simulation games that I have played on Steam.",
