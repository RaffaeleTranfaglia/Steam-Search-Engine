There was no internet to use when I got stuck, I solved every puzzle by myself. But playing it after 20 years was a bit frustrating and to be honest I had to use some hints. Thanks Monkey Island for making me use my brain again.",

Attention-to-detail is just excellent: switching between the new and the old version happens on the go with just a press of a button. Here you can clearly see how similar the new graphics are to the old one in terms of design elements.  Voice acting and sound effects are, of course, very good once more and they immediately get you hooked up! One notable difference compared to the previous episode is the more-easy-to-use action selection. Also, we have now extra features such as the concept arts that are accessible via the main menu and gradually get unlocked as we make further progress in Guybrush's journey.   Additionally, developer commentaries are available at various scenes - the creators of the original game discuss the fun they had with the making of the game and the various obstacles they had to overcome due to technological constraints. Oh, and in case you missed achievements from the first now you have a dozen of them ready to be unlocked.  This is a great game just as the first one and it only brings back fond memories of my childhood. I can only recommend this to the fans of the good old point-and-click adventure games and I do look forward to playing Day of The Tentacle which is the absolute must after the Monkey Island games!

            "review_text": " Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge is the second game in the amazing Monkey Island series and probably my favourite point and click to this day   I've never been a huge fan of point and clicks because I prefer more fast paced gameplay but I was begged by a friend to try the Monkey Island series just once because it is his favourite franchise ever. MI2 went above and beyond anything I could have ever expected.  Monkey Island 2 is the second part in the adventures of Guybrush Threepwood who is, to put it politely, a rather rubbish pirate. After defeating LeChuck and 'rescuing' his love interest Elaine, Guybrush is back in search of a new story to tell and decides he will find the legendary Treasure of Big Whoop. But LeChuck has other plans....  Monkey Island 2 Special Edition brings you the original game with some added bonuses such as entirely remastered graphics, fantastic voice acting, new music, a much better and more intuitive interface and an added hint system (which might just be needed for those new to the franchise). There are also various bits of behind the scene commentary and art and for those of you who are like me; ACHIEVEMENTS. It's one of the few games I actually wanted to completed every single achievement as some were pretty amusing. You can choose to play in the remastered edition or the original and can switch between them at any point quickly and easily.  You'll spent your time exploring the Caribbean trying to uncover the mystery of Big Whoop. Along the way you'll meet some new faces and some old ones (used coffins popular these days) all of which have larger than life personalities, classic catchphrases and undefiable logical. You'll find yourself talking to every single person you encounter because you know they'll have something good to say. You'll be faced with challenges, puzzles, riddles and even the odd untraditional 'sword-fight' (I've heard you are a contemptible sneak). You'll experience the wonders of love (or at least try), make new friends (and many, many more enemies) and finally make your name as the greatest pirate ever (…).   LucasArts were able to create something fantastic with Monkey Island, combining great gameplay, a wonderful story, loveable characters and perfect humor to make a point and click adventure that'll keep you coming back time and time again. It never feels boring and it never gets old, no matter how many times you've heard the jokes, it just brings back that nice warm feeling.     Part of me feels that I missed out on something amazing never getting to play Monkey Island as a child but I am so glad I had a chance to experience it both in it's original glory and remastered. It's a shame LucasArts are no longer around to create games because they created some masterpieces in their life. Monkey Island is one of the best. ",

The UI is much better than in the first part's special edition, so playing feels a bit smoother and more relaxing. There's also an audio commentary by the devs, if one is interested.  The new graphics are good, but the truth is, MI2 had stunning graphics back in the day, and I actually prefer the old ones to some of the new ones this time. However, it's easy to toggle between the two and check out how the action looks in the other version. I played this game in Spanish like I did the previous one, just for fun to learn a word or two, works well like that also.  Recommended not only for fans of nostalgia, but also for new players looking for a relaxing trip. One just has to remember that you can't do anything wrong or die in the game (well, technically you can in one scene, but that doesn't count here). That's quite different to most games and might sound boring at first, but it isn't.",

            "review_text": "Monkey Island 2 Special Edition is an excellent remake of the outstanding sequel. Much of the remake work is similar to the first game, though there are more improvements around for an even more refined and polished game. The continued story in the sequel holds up well to the first game, and a nicer remake overall does wonders to making the game experience be a pleasure.  Since this game is a direct sequel in terms of story, it is definitely recommended to play the original Secret of Monkey Island first. Gameplay is much the same of point and click adventure games. In Monkey Island 2 SE, there are a few more touches to smoothly play the game. Rather than interacting and having to bring up the entire list of verbs, right clicking brings up all available actions that can be used. This is very useful since some actions can’t be used on some objects, and it helps to see all available actions that can elicit a response from Guybrush. Item interaction is also easier, with the game defaulting to certain actions when using them. These two features are especially useful for scenes requiring some quick actions, which appear more often in MI2. A new hint feature appears in the form of object highlighting. It definitely helps for rooms with many objects, where all the objects in the room are shown by pressing Left Click and Right Click together. Also new is the Direct Control mode, where Guybrush can be controlled directly rather than using click actions. This is definitely useful for controller users who want to sit back on a big TV display. The old Classic mode switching ability is still present, and it also allows players to hear the new voiceovers while using the Classic mode UI. Overall, the same point and click gameplay is in MI2, though things definitely changed up for better navigation and controls to make things more comfortable to use.  The same great redone art style is employed throughout the game like in Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition. Overall, the redone artwork is better in MI2, since the first game did have some stiff and not very refined looking artwork. The backgrounds are a touch more fleshed out and look beautiful, and some of the character animations are smoother too. A select few characters use some 3D animation and move smoothly, perhaps a bit too smoothly from the originals. Still, the overall art quality bump in the sequel is great, with rich environments and distinct characters like the first game, but with even better quality.  Music plays a big role in the Monkey Island games, and this game still does it well with the remade songs. The sequel has some outstanding music work, much like the first game too. With the game’s soundtrack sounding great, it is nice to appreciate some of the subtleties of the music as well. Some of the themes are reused in certain areas and at times the current song slowly fades into another song when the room changes. They are very nice small touches that make playing the game feel great when they happen, and the recorded instrumentation is always a nice touch on the original MIDI compositions.  The story of Monkey Island 2 continues from the first game, focusing mainly on Guybrush Threepwood and LeChuck. I won’t elaborate on the story much since it does draw from the first game a lot, though I will say I noted that this game is slightly darker and more dramatic than the first game. There are the series’ classic funny moments, though there are just some actions the player has to take and some story directions the writers made that makes the tone just slightly different. It’s a solid Monkey Island game though, with great moments and a well-crafted story for those who played the first game.  The remade sequel provides a nice experience, comparably better than the first game in certain parts. Gameplay is mostly the same, though a few additions to make navigating the game smoother are welcome touches to use. The art is still great to look at, and there are some considerable improvements in quality from the previous game. The music is outstanding as ever, with some subtle transitions and arrangements being employed on the soundtrack for a great listen. Monkey Island 2 Special Edition is a remake that stands up to the original game, with well-deserved refinements that make it a blast to play through.",

The characters are distinct and interesting and the dialog is endearing, funny, and delivered well. And the story's not bad...mostly.  The reason I don't recommend this game is that it's too hard. By that I mean that a substantial number of the things you have to do to advance the game are completely idiosyncratic. When I have to break down and consult a walk through for a point-and-click game my reaction to learning the solution usually falls into one of three categories:  1.) 'Well, I feel stupid for not identifying that obvious and imminently reasonable solution.' 2.) 'Oh, that was clever. I bet figuring that out on my own would have been satisfying.' 3.) 'F*** you, game. That makes no sense.'  About 1/3 through the game, my wife and I broke down and checked a walk through because we had a bazillion inventory items and a half dozen hopelessly stalled leads. The solution was soundly in the 'F*** you' category. So were the next two solutions that we had to look up shortly thereafter. At that point we threw in the towel and just sailed through the last half of the game with a walkthrough. I have no shame. We're adults and have stuff to do that doesn't involve spending six months rubbing everything on everything else in an attempt to move the plot forward. Also, the genuinely clever and funny dialog? It gets a lot less funny when it loops 100 times while you're standing on one screen for 15 min clicking on all the things with all the other things. Admittedly, once we just followed a walkthrough, the game wasn't half bad in a visual novel kind of way.  So, yeah. I guess I could recommend this game (especially for the $2.49 it is at time of writing) if you are ok with playing through with substantial help of a walkthrough or are 11 and have months to click on all the things, forever. Or if you're psychic, I guess.   Also, I thought the ending was really lame, though that's kind of a taste thing. Personally, if I had slogged my way through this without a walkthrough I would have been mad.",
