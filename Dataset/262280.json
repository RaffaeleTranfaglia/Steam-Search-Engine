It gives you the feeling like your about to have a great Evil dungeon master experience then falls short with limited rooms and limited units just limited everything. It’s not an awful game it plays well responds well and the story is even fun. it’s just hard to enjoy when in the back of your mind you know its already been done better years ago and the entire time thats what your craving.

            "review_text": "Great Game, lots of fun. Controlling your minions with a black and white style brings back all my nostalgia. The tower defense feeling and rts side is outstanding. The game feels a mix of black and white, warcraft 3, Dungeon Keeper, and even a feeling of dwarf fortress. The Combat is entertaining if a little crowded and the AI that handles fighting is extremely smart. Simple right-click into a battle will have your minions not running like idiots to their deaths. If they get hit, they hit back.   That being said. It feels like it is missing too much content.   -3 maps for skirmash and 6 maps for multiplayer after the release is a little disappointing. Hoping for community maps maybe. -Narrator talks too much. Wish I had an option to mute him or skip the dialogue. -Lag Issues when units are being hit by traps. -Payday needs to either be longer or instanteous. Half of the time the minions are just walking back and forth between paydays. -Minions slack off way too easily requires a lot of slapping. -Demons are currently underpowered and cost too much pop.  This games needs to let you play the human Race, like a game mode of dungeon Invader almost. If new maps come out and the lag issues are handled, this game will be alot more fun. It just feels like it is missing something to keep me playing.",

CONS: - the firsts levels in the campagin are easy, but this is not bad for everyone. In skirmish you can choose the difficulty and there's also the Multiplayer, that I have not tried.   ",

            "review_text": "So i have almost 20 hours of gameplay on this game by now and here are my findings:  So obviously you and I are going to compaire this game to the dungeon keeper (DK) series and the new war for the overworld (WFTO) game. I have played all of these games so i decided that to compaire them for the people that are deciding between these games:   so lets begin with this games unique feature: the overworld. In this game you can send your minions up to plunder the hometowns of the heroes. Now ofcourse we all agree that this is a remarkebly cool feature but there are also some minor issues with it:  First of all the overworld uses RTS style gameplay instead of dungeon management so you can order your units arround. Now this is verry nice for intercepting incomming raiding parties before they enter your dungeon because you can for example actually force your archers to stay behind your melee guys to save them from a horibly painfull death. Now we all agree that this is nice but unfortunetely the AI in the RTS mode does little more then a 'me orc... me bash' approach wich makes it necesarry to micromanage every unit. Also some units refuse to cast their spells automatically wich makes battle difficult because you have to micromanage every single unit.   Also it should be noted that you do not actually gain anything from plundering the overworld. For example in one the campaign missions you have to stop gold convoys. However when you kill off a convoy you do not actually get any gold.   Thus far the overworld. Now back to the comparison. In will number my own comments such that you can eassily refer to them should anyone feel the need to post a comment: 1) In case of grapics, this game is in my opnion better then the old DK series but also better then war for the overworld but it also appears to have slightly higher system requirements. I should note here that i do not state that war for the overworld has bad grapics, i just think that these look beter personally. 2) In terms of price. This game is by far the most expensive. The old DK games can be found on gog for about 5 euros. War for the overworld costs about 30 euros and this game costs a whopping 45 euros at the time this review was written.  3) This game has 2 factions: the horde and the demons. each faction has 12 units devided over 4 catagories and 8 rooms. It should also be noted that there is no way to convert heroes into villans in this game whereas you can do as such in the DK series. In my opinion the number of units and rooms in this game is rather low when i compare it to the WFTO and DK. I would prefer a merged version of the 2 factions in which the number of possible rooms increases.  4) When comparing the dungeon management gameplay to WFTO and DK, i always had a sense of 'i have to rush this' in WFTO. So peronally i like the gameplay in dungeons 2 better then WFTO. But your own experience can be diffrent ofcourse. 5) WFTO has far more skrimish maps in their release version whereas dungeons 2 has only 3. Now i expect that this number will increase at some point in time but i personally fear that they will bring out the 'new' skrimish maps as a DLC which would annoy me greatly becasue imo they should present in the base version of the game.  Thus far my comparison of these games. If you feel that i missed something please tell me and i will endevour to add a section about that specific topic.  The only thing left to say would be: Should you buy these games? My personal opionion? YES! but then i feel this way for all Dungeon-keeper-like-games including DK and WFTO.",

The gameplay and choices in minions isn't that much compared to Dungeon keeper 2. Also, exploring around in the dungeon isn't that rewarding.  Another negative is when playing the campaign, you never run into rival evil doers. Just boring waves of mobs. You can go on the surface aka warcraft 3 simplified mode which is rather boring but unfortunately needed to finish the game.",

When a AAA publisher gets greedy, there is ALWAYS someone to fill that vacuum.  However, there are a couple of flaws: 1. The narrator is funny, then clever, then sarcastic, then annoying. I get REFERENCES LOL but they give him way too much to say. A bit of a nag. 2. Very few monster types. 3. I absolutely appreciate the attempt to blend both the sim and the RTS, however the control changes between the two is always jarring and the RTS element seems particularly half baked.  I'm going to enjoy this one immensely, but make no mistake, there are flaws.",

This game has a lot of really cool things going for it and I like the direction the developers are taking it. I also like that the developers are so active in the chats and trying to help anyone with bugs/issues. I have a sub par comp and i have absolutley no problems with this game. I think my only problem is the narrator talks to frequently...... thats literally it lol. I mean I could be nit picky but its a good game and i am glad I spent my 35 bucks on it. Def money well spent, if your reading all the negative junk hey you should just stop buying any games because every game will have people griping and complaning till they are red in the face. It doesnt mean you wont like this game because someone found a flaw that they personally didnt like.   (Read the nagative reviews but keep the positive in mind as well)   Graphics remind me of torchlight two but better. 8.5/10 Gameplay is good no holes has a campaign and multiplayer. 8/10  Helpful Devs and community. 10/10  Game didnt ship broken to where i couldnt play it! 1000/10 Overly talkative narrator 4/10 (I am sure they will tone him down in an update/patch)  Overall id give it an 8.5/10   Its a fun entertaining game definitely worth putting on your wishlist and or buying. If your still hesitant about the price wait for a coupon/sale you will not be dissapointed.",

            "review_text": "To be honest I did not really like original game. It was lacking something intangible. I think I know what exactly, now. First thing that catches your eye is the art. Little minions strolling around, drowning in vivid colors. World of rabbits and unicorns darkening and changing as you, the Ultimate Evil, stroll behind them, casually destroying houses damaging them for 666 or 665 with each hit (the last one just because he became a bit tired and bored). Those little details here and there are just amazing. Even gold reserves are not just gold as in other similar games: they have precious stones, like rubies and emeralds. After you come out of the shock from the beauty of the game you will dive into another shock: 'What is this? RTS?' Do not rush to the conclusions yet. You do start by controlling your alter ego as in RTS, but then due to scenario you are diminished to an ethereal corpse. And this is when you you become the keeper. There are some significant differences compared to classic dungeon keeper here, inspired by the same RTS genre. 1st of all, you do not 'attract' minions, you buy them and there is a limit to how many you can, as in RTS games. 2ndly rooms are clickable. And for a good reason: they need some micro-management, too: you need to build 'facilities' in there to help the rooms work properly, and some of them allow you to research stuff like new buildings and upgrade stuff, as well. You do not claim the tiles, too: you just clear the dirt. Dirt is different here, too. 1st of all you can 'raise walls' here. It is required to increase efficiency of the rooms: they need to be surrounded by walls for increase productivity. There are also 2 types of gold tiles: some give you a lot of gold, but get destroyed quickly, while others are virtually eternal and you can dig gold from them for quite some time, but slowly. Although, so far I never experience an urgent need for lots of cash. Unlike other keepers minions here should be cherished. As mentioned, you have a limited supply of those due to population limit. Also they do gain levels, which makes them stronger. You can also give them medals, which add some 'honorifics' to their names. Yes, they all have NAMES. Makes it more personal. It's also nice how non-worker types smash on walls when bored and there are also those pop-ups, that tell you some thoughts of the minions, like what they are doing at the moment. I also like, how traps get restored here. When activated by heroes, they do not vanish freeing the tile, they stay there, waiting for repairs and once repaired, they can work again. If you have enough resources and build the traps wisely, you can generally forget about protection of the entrance, because it will be self-sufficient. And you will require some free time. Because, you see, there are 2 maps here. Map of your dungeon and... Map of the world above the dungeon. You can take a minion, drop him on a certain building and... Her goes out for a walk in the forest. To crash some skulls. Here I am reminded of those old-school solo missions in StarCraft or WarCraft, where you can't build anything, but have a few units, that you need to control precisely in order to finish the objectives. It may even have some stealth elements. And again - these units continue getting level-ups, medals and stuff like that. And all that is presented by a narrator, who keeps giving jokes close to what we could hear in Overlord game series. With some 4th wall breaking here and there. This is actually what original game was lacking (besides the amazing art-style). It gives the game a 'soul', makes it even more alive, even though dungeon keeping still feels slow at times. Although, admittedly, minions here do seem a bit... Well, fat. In need of proper training. So, this is a rally good game. There are lots of minor things, that make it stand out among the others f the genre. These details show, that it was developed with love. Only 2 cons I currently see is that dungeon keeping is quite slow and generally easy and some minor interface annoyances (like sometimes you have to hover over the tutorial or event notification, because otherwise you will click on the tile, not on the actual icon). I definitely recommend it. 8/10",

The biggest negative is the fact it takes and hour to build up anything half decent and the narrator wont shut up about how slow you are.  Those are the most glaring problems i see most people comment on(including myself) i enjoyed the game for what it was. Build dungeon ✔, control little minions ✔, crush all who oppose you with the might of a massive(20-30 units so not massive massive) armies ✔. Wont say its worth how much its priced right now but maybe it be best to buy this when its on sale for roughly 20 or less bucks.  Hopefully they add more content or speed up the progression in the game, do either of those and ill probably play it for another 10-12 hours. But to reiterate, no buy now, buy on sale.",

I head to the hall of admiration to tell the local Succubus how amazing she looks. Demons never tire of compliments. and least I don't have to praise the Infernals, the contact burns get old fast.  8:00 AM: Inspect the west annex guard complex for trap resets. Got slapped for walking past a disarmed tentacle. Huh, how'd that happen?  10:00 AM: The previous shift must not be doing there jobs, 3 fire grates, 4 spiders eggs and tentacle trap all left un-reset or disarmed, spider eggs moved in place, a bit of work and the west annex should be secure. would be easier if Phil still worked my shift, but . . . oh well.  10:05 AM: fled in terror from a Dwarf and his solders and the Bard who was clearly responsible for my trap work overtime. Hit the Gong in the west annex. My most abominable Evil hear my prayers, they're at the door, and I don't want to die.  10:15 AM: After a very large rumble outside the door, i peek out to see a group of Pit Fiends playing rugby with the Bard's corpse. Back to work it is. A Mindflayer fell in the carnage, I'll take him for re-summoning, and maybe even see Phil on the way.  Noon: Finish fixing all the havoc and clean out the smell of the heroes from the west annex. get slapped some more for not finishing sooner. Where the heck is Phil, and how can managing Summoning Portals take so much time? He's nowhere, is he just sleeping on the job, or is there a second chamber of summoning Portals i don't know about?  1:00PM: Say Hi to bob as we both head to transports some exploding eggs and fire grates to the south annex. He hasn't seen Phil since yesterday either. Man, that promotion must mean he gets to work directly with the Ultimate Evil. Lucky him!  2:15PM: Wave and send off the latest group of demons to the surface, may their spoils be glorious yaddah yaddah, good riddance, now to get REAL work done. Bob, Jim and I are going to go expand the south annex, Evil wants mana crystals and there should be some down there.  3:30PM:Jim got promoted thanks to the THREE of us finding a mana crystal and widening a path for an Abyssal and some Succubi to clear out the golem guards. Strange, that Abyssal looks new around here, then again, most demons just look the same to me. He laughed when i asked him if he saw Jim when he got summoned here. Summoning Portal management must be pretty cushy if you get to share jokes with the higher ups.  4:00PM: explain to the the newly hired Servants, Ted and Rick, the finer points of Demon Admiration. on a good day, its all succubi and evil mistresses, on a bad infernals, Mindflayers, and any variety of Fright Demon. you have to fake it till you make it, except for the mindflayers, they'll know, and then your robed fuzzy butt is flayed. but if they enjoy it, i guess that counts as admiration, right?  5:00PM: Unbelievable, un-f-ing believable, Ted is here for less than a day and Ultimate evil has decided he's management material. At least I dodged a nasty bit by letting Rick get nominated for torture chamber clean up. He can have it. I must be slipping in my work ethic to get passed up.  6:00PM: Assist the Ultimate Evil, and the Abyssal running the Mana forge by expanding in size. This abyssal reminds me of Jim somehow. I must be overworked. get slapped for daydreaming about the Summoning Portal Managers and their cushy lifestyle. I've finished my shift, I'm off to grab some shuteye. Tomorrow is another chance at getting my much deserved promotion.  TLDR: feed workers to hell portals for unit upgrades, 10/10, would burn the countryside every time.",

The levels reminded me of playing warcraft more then anything, and it felt really good, I just wish there was MORE.   The player vs player isnt well put together in the sense theres no server/game list, simply a code you type in to join eachother or to que up for a 'matchmaking' system which doesnt seem to work unsurprisingly and most likely because of lack of players queing.

The UI icons are pretty huge and it's also full of unnecessary submenus that just make getting to everything a little more harder than it should.   Basically this is the fisher price consolized version of Dungeon Keeper, it's slow, really likes to hold your hand and is really easy.

The reality is that, when Dungeons came out, everone started comparing it to the old masterpieces, and mostly unfavorably. Kalipso seems to have taken the hint, swallowed some pride, and went all out to bring the fun of Dungeon Keeper back to life with a full slate of new and challenging features into the bargain. They had big shoes to fill; we look back at the old games of the good old days, and they seem to have a golden sheen. I believe they actually had to move to a bigger size for this one. The humor is just as good, factoring in the slight nod they've given to a somewhat younger crowd (16 vs. 18 or 21, depending on how prudish you may be), and the style is familiar without being exactly the same. Fighting across different maps makes it challanging and new. They involve the world in the gameplay in ways that DK never could have, and the cute vs. darkish tension makes me laugh, and maybe you too. I look forward to DLC and see hours of playing this in the future. It's just a good time.",

Although if you were looking to be able to decorate your dungeon like you did Dungeons with all the prestige gadgets then you will be mildy disappointed.  The first few campaign missions tend to suck a bit because of the polulation limit hampering your resource management. However once you get to the mission that unlocks the poulation cap increases it becomes much more managable.  The outdoors portion brings a refreshing feature to the game. In most missions you have the ability to stop the adventurers before they even reach your dungeon. However it also brings more risk because you can unlock more enterances into your dungeon from outdoors and expanding underground. For those who played Impire the outdoor portion of this game is way beyond watching a timer.  The narrator can be both funny and annoying. Having a narrator tell your story as you progress is an interesting new twist. However it quickly becomes annoying if you are not progressing on your mission fast enough.  Have not played multiplayer or a skirmish yet, but from what I have seen those features should bring more replayability to the game. Campaign replayability not so much those first four campaign missions are a pain enough to not want to replay them. ",

You also cannot possess your creatures, not a big deal, but it always had a charm to see your dungeon from first person perspective.  Also the game is very very short, and once you finish it, you probably won't want to do a second playthrough for quite some time.  Lastly, many, many people who buy this are unable to finish the game at all. There is a game breaking bug where levels will not load and the game simply hangs. As of this date 8/18/2015 there is no fix. The programers have passed the buck stating 'It's a problem with the unity engine, and we have asked them to fix it'. No other unity games have this issue, so I'm calling BS on that one.

That's not much content for a $30 game, especially one where they could've added a lot more content simply by rehashing the same game, but with different objectives, to flesh things out, and it still would have been fun.

Since the game involves quite a bit of micromanagement to upgrade your units, defend your dungeon, etc., poor performance is super crippling and tedious.

Seems to be tangibly correlated to wealth acquisition which the engine simply can't handle when coupled with all the miscellaneous bits being produced in the brewery and workshop when combined with large treasure troves. Yes I could simply not do any buildup and charge the enemy but that seems to make that little pleasure of aggrandizement a moot one, yes?   3) Sign in/up screen every time you start the game. See store page for 'Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: Kalypso Launcher (Account registration optional)'  Yeah, you can click to skip because it is supposedly optional, but why should I have to click to skip, each and every time? Yes you can skip it, but I just want to play the game; beam me up scotty - don't make me WALK up a light beam to the Enterprise.  I mean, without an option to make the optional screen optional, then it seems I'm out of options, aren't I? Hmph.(mindblown)   Analysis: If you don't mind being pulled out of immersion to be advertized to in that 'Satire being what it satirizes is no longer satire but reality.' kind of way, if you don't mind random losses of gameplay, and if you don't mind a not-so-optional-because-it-lacks-an-option-to-be-optional optional sign in/up screen, then grab a fistful of legal tender and drop it in their Treasure hole to get this party started.  Otherwise, step back, and give them some time to swat some snots and drop the patches out to get rid of commercial time and the reminiscent-of-my-little-brother-being-a-jackass-in-the-pool splash screen, leaving me with a similar, but metaphorical, searing chlorine eye sheen.  Done.  Now then, if you remove said splash screen and in-game advertizing from the narrator, then I will happily spin me right round - like a record baby - and give this review the shoe, turning my philosophical frown upside down and recommending it straight away.  Edit: And I have, as promised :) It's a reasonable go between, at least.  I'll recommend it with the above caveats, that is. If you aren't bothered, then the rest is a pleasant and comedic game that is aware of the industry within which it resides.",

It's not exactly the same, it keeps the most basic premises and changes everything else.  Now that we've gotten that out of the way, this is still a good game on its own. If you need a way to waste a few hours of your life you won't be disappointed. You still build a dungeon and fill it with monsters and gold, but this time you get to control your monsters, at the expense of not controlling your dungeon lord. You still get spells, though, so it's kinda like having a dungeon lord anyways. This makes it easier to allocate units across your dungeon where they are needed, like at your core when being attacked.  The game also adds in the overworld, which gives you a chance to stretch your legs a bit and attack things with your minions. Balancing attacking targets with defending your dungeon gets a bit tricky at times but is easily managed.  Overall, the game is worth playing. Once you let go of the need for it to be a carbon copy of the first, it's fun and balanced and that's what's important.",

            "review_text": " The Jist  : Not worth full price (currently 39.99€) at all. I Bought it at 9.99€. Scathingly worth it. Relax and chill comedic game you can't lose. DON'T expect it to be anything like Dungeon Keeper.   If you played Dungeon Keeper 2, this game will interest you because you really want Dungeon Keeper III. This isn't Dungeon Keeper III. Just remove all thought of that. It's Warcraft : Orcs and Humans, with 3D graphics and some rather forced elements of DKII.     You're never at risk of losing. The enemy AI is just too dumb, and even the scripting is plain easy. Nothing interesting ever happens. At no point did I ever feel unsafe in my dungeon. So much so, that the only reason I ever saved is because the game crashes occasionally.     The overworld feels annoying, and the discontinuity between over and under world control of creatures is poor design. In the overworld it's classic RTS, underworld it switches to DK.    The story is told by a narrator, and it's quite amusing and full of pop culture references. I actually laughed. Twice.    Overall, the gameplay was not engaging enough, but it was engaging enough that I completed the campaign, and side missions. The story is amusing enough, and the voice actor did very well with the material he had. I definately feel I got my 9.99€ worth, and I don't feel like I wasted my time, but there's this burning feeling that they could have done so much MORE. I will probably buy Dungeons 3. When it's on sale. I think Kalypso did a good job. They likely just didn't have the budget to make this game great.  They probably spent all their money in litigation with EA :p   Note : This review does not take into account any DLC, and the experience was played without any of the DLC. ",

            "review_text": "This game is obviously heavily influenced by the old Dungeon Keeper games, but somehow doesn't quite capture the old magic of those games (which I really liked).  It's kind of an automated RTS where if you don't specifically direct your units to do something, they will get to work on their own. This lets you focus on building your dungeon without having to micro-manage your units (although on occassion you will want to do so). You just set tasks, like digging out tunnels or researching new traps, spells or skills and the appropriate dungeon denisons go about the task.  What this adds that DK did not have is an above ground element. This felt a lot like Warcraft to me and had a much more normal RTS feeling with you directing troops to march across the map and attack units. I don't know if this element added as much to the game as I thought it would.  Overall, the game is much simpler than DK with less room types, less monster types and overall much easier missions. I never had to start a level again and never really felt under pressure from the heros invading my dungeon. Basically, the game was too easy. I guess I should have played on hard instead of medium...  Overall, I had fun and it wasn't a big commitment of hours, so I would definitely recommend it to fans of the DK games and those looking for a light RTS experience.  7/10",
