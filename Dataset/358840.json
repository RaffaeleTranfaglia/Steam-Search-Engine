There is no distinct warning for danger, and the controls are a little clunky. I really wanted this to be better than it was. I apologize to the developer for the bad review but I really can't endorse it.   You will probably notice that there is no almost no time played on my account for this game but that is just because i played in steam offline mode an a different computer because of the ridiculously absurd fact that you need to download java to run this game.   I gace it like an hour and a half to prove itself worthy but Sorry but this gets a thumbs down.",
