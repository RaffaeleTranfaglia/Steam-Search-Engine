            "review_text": " I can't... I just can't...   This game, there's no words to describe it. It's bad, awful, a vile piece of work developed by one man who seems to have used an Engine ('RPG MAKER') for a Visual Novel and did not even program it correctly to act along the Visual Novel setting.   From save game bugs to the most basic spelling errors that even a 2nd grader can spot - I just can't.   If you're a furry, like me, who enjoys the art of writing and this game seems interesting to you I have to tell you one thing buddy... Don't waste your money, save it, better yet give it to charity.  Aside from my mindless rambling about how bad this game is I'd like to name this game the  'No Mann Sky of Visual Furry Novels' , a title it truly deserves.    The Story:  The plot is really bad, like really. The 2016 Election would make for a better plot for a visual novel than this game; Your character is so lackluster - It feels like your playing a mindless zombie and it's worse than a telltale game, your choices don't really matter unless you want the ending which is defined as 'good'.    The game tries to reeeaaaallly push out 'morality' in your face by giving you a bunch of moral questions throughout it, Are these moral questions good? No, they can be answered by a kid with a capable mind.    The characters are either boring, dull or plain stupid - I'd love to name names but I know the history of how reviews here get flagged, so I'll be good and abide by the Rules &amp; Guidelines.    Anyways, the story is set in some sort of hyper-dimensional time wish washy thingo mingo let's all go to bingo; It's extremely saddening to see.    Throughout the story you'll be able to experience the Developer's inner mindset by seeing and noticing what books, video games or political thoughts he might have had throughout the making of this game - Which keep in mind just makes this game a bunch of other 'things' combined up to this monstrosity.    The game is set up in Japan, but everyone speaks English and everything IS English (just a silly note).   If you're here for the 'novelization' of an epic, choice-thrilling quest of adventure then you came to the wrong place buddy.    The Visualization:  Oh, the Art style is fine, it's terrific actually - the one bit I'll give the game a plus in. But that's still like 1/10 lads.  The characters don't have emotions, sometimes when they are supposedly sad they still use the 'preset' face and look happy as heck, or dull - Which takes the emotional part of visual novels away, How is this a visual novel if their emotions are not visualized?  Surprisingly the Developer and another character you meet in the game (Yes, the developer is IN the game) are the only two characters with multiple expressions... Yep.    The Sound:   From what I can enquire the game uses preset soundtracks and even if it doesn't, It's still bad sound.   You'll need your own soundtrack to play through this mess, believe me.    Programming &amp; Code:  The game runs on RPG Maker; An engine made for RPG games, not visual novels - I mean, it can be used for Visual Novels, it's not like it can't but still... The Developer didn't even remove some parts of the Engine that still exist... Pressing enter is the only way to save the game when you get a chance to do that and even then, Saving doesn't always work (so save multiple times).   It feels really boring when your game crashes, you can't save or when some sort of weird bug happens - It destroys the game, but the plot already did.    Anything Else:  There are SEVERAL characters missing from the game - Once more I can name them but I choose not to for the safety of my steam account lads; It seems that they were removed from the game by a personal dispute with the Developer.    Most characters are those of backers who've donated a fair sum of money to the game and or are friends of the Developer - some of these people have reaaally weird stuff on the backend of things...    Also, It appears no girls have backed this game as all the female's within this game are OC's and they are HEAVILY stereotyped females... - Everyone in the game is either a masculine man, or a feminine boy, or a female stereotype.    I feel sorry for anyone who has donated for this game, I feel sorry for the Developer who had to go through the trouble of making this mess and I feel sorry for anyone who has bought it... I just do.      In three short word's I'll describe this game to you   'Bland, disappointing and sad'  - It had potential, It had potential... If only where the criticism of this game picked up by the Developer instead of pulling out a George Lucas on us all.    If you're still thinking of buying this game after my review, or would like me to answer you some questions - Please, feel free to add me and take a moment of your time to think for yourself if you really want to buy this... In the end of the day, it's YOUR investment.    [Alongside this review will be published a video review in the upcoming months, so be prepared my fellow gamers and writers] ",

I dont really like novella games but this game is wonderful: -It's furry game (furries love furries, right?) -Interesting story. First time i didnt expect something special from this story untill i finished 1st chapter. Moral choices which affect on storyline - Lovely characters. Seriously, every character so wonderful, unusual and memorable. - So many achievements (too many)  But there is one thing that I do not really like: - Some moments are pretty big spoilers in story for next chapters. Its not super horrible but it would be way cooler if they would be unexpected.  I can say that i dont regret that i bought this game.  If you are novella lover (and furry fan) you would love this game  P.S. I have few important questions about this game so i would like to talk with Klace ",

            "review_text": "When playing this game several questions spring to mind in order: Why on earth did they put a border around the game? Why are the controls so messed up? Why is the resolution of the artwork so low? Why can't they just read my keyboard input when writing a name? Why is the max length of the name so short?  Why can't I use spaces in my name?  Now I understood this game was made with RPGMaker and I'm not familliar with the limitations of said product but a lot of these things should be incredibly easy to fix. If these really are limitations of RPGMaker then creating this game without it would make much more sense.   The resolution and artwork detail is not very high but I can imagine that creating tons and tons of images for a game like this is a pretty challenging task and after the first couple of images you hardly notice it anymore. The art style is great though.  Though I haven't played much the story seems very engaging and I love the vast amount of choices you get to make.  The music is very good as well though I might be a bit biased because I love Fox Amoore.  Based on my first impression I'd say only buy it if you have an affinity for fur ;)",

If your feeling like playing a game that revolves what you do I would advise playing this game.

Along with the fact that it has made me cry on some spot(not going to say where) and made me feel, falling in love with most of the characters or hating them. over all this was a awesomeely well made game and worth the price.",

This game is very, very, feelsy, well it has a lot of emotion put into the scenerioes, and the characters you develop bonds with, holy moley...Klace did do a good job on the bonds, let me tell you that. (No, its not anything pron related, get out of here pron sterotyping people :v )   This game, if I had to rate it based on different aspects well...  Difficulty - 0/10 -Its a visionary moral storytale. How hard can that be? Wait...feels, right, crap...  Emotion - 20/10 -I'm not saying I cried at least once in the game, I'm just saying some chapters, some events, some things got me a bit teary eyed. -Got to dance with Konrad. Yis.  Story - 10/10 -Very well thought out, each choice seems it does affect the gameplay later on. Its also interesting how said choices play out, too! -Various endings, and even though I just got through with one, and I'm still recovering from the feels. -The story does grab you right from the start. You meet one character, then another, then something happens, and boom. You want to continue forth. Good strategy IMO! -Well thought out - Its not one of those that are in it just for a short story, its actually...The words and such used, are so well placed, that every line leaves you wanting to know more. (I at least wondered about a few characters when they were introduced, or an event happened regarding a specific character) -Different atmospheres in a single game. Could be a spoiler, but I'll just leave it at that. x3  Overall - 10/10  For a game that is furry themed, I didn't just think of it as just that. I went into this game thinking it would be a feelsy-type game, but I was right...but I didn't expect -that- much feels. Like geez, Klace. Calm -down- on the feels. ;u;  Besides, even if it is furry-themed, its far from any of the furry sterotypes out there, such as the obvious one I mentioned up there. This game is definately one if you want a emotion roller-coaster. It will make you laugh one scene, then be saddened next...or happy, then angry at the choice you made back in a previous chapter (*Cough* &gt;_&gt; )  Pretty much, buy this game if you want your emotions tied up so much, you want to vomit rainbows.  And also if you want to dance with a black/blue wolf omg Konrad. ;w; ",

            "review_text": "Where can I begin? Wow...what a story... This is less of a review and more of me ranting and rambling on what I did and how I felt. Lots of random thoughts entered this review, expect it to jump around a little. (Just in case the code does not work in the review, SPOILERS below)  I wish I could give Major/Minor a fair review, I really wish I could. I am too invested in this world and the characters; it was all I could think about until I finished. I wanted closure, I wanted that happy ending.   So many wonderful characters died  , it made me more obsessed to complete the game. I stayed up late to finish it, and now I want to explore more of it to get the best possible scenario.  Any game that gets me to cry is seriously considered by me to be well written, so that I can say for sure. All other points I could make are possibly biased; wether I liked the characters more because I am a furry or not, for example, I am not sure. One thing I can say for sure, this was one hell of a ride, and I wouldn't overlook this game just becuase of the furry factor. Like the argument I'd make for Dust, an Elysian Tail, you'd be missing out for sure.  Instead of talking about wether the game was good or not, I'd like to share my experience and how the game made me feel. I decided to remain truthful in chapter one on my first desicion, much to Rook's dismay.   This was my first mistake in the long run; not knowing I'd have to bond with Rook so early. My second mistake was starting the Eclair storyline, not the Jade storyline. I missed so many TEF's (true Ending Flags) in that path alone it screwed me over.   Strill, I tried to be nice to everyone and bond with as many characters as possible, but it started to get confusing and hard.  In Chapter 2 I found myself   Trusting Reiyo a little too much, I just assumed he didn't have much to hide for some reason. It was around chapter 3 that I started not trusting many of the characters, starting when Righty told me about the assassins' loyalty to the king. By chapter 4 I had no idea who had caused the murders, and this in turn caused me some anxiety. Every character seemed to have a second agenda, and the more people i saw in the Ark in flashbacks the more hurt I felt. I thought at least I could trust Kila with my secrets, until i learned who he was much later.      It ate away at me that I'd lost my trust in everyone. I didn't want to pick a side; at one point, I wanted to get the hell away from everybody and figure out this mess for myself. I'd even lost trust in Reiyo and Kila, who I thought were the last people I'd abandon trust in. Still, I forgave and pushed on. That is a flaw of mine, I let people walk over me more than I should, and even though I was upset I still found myself forgiving.      Actually, there was one character I trusted, and this is why I saved Rook over Kila in chapter 6. At this point I only wanted one thing though; blood. This duty as savior put upon me was too much, and I didn't want it anymore. I just wanted to stop the madness and bring everyone back, but at the same time I didn't want anything to do with it anymore. I almost quit, actually; the story became personal and distressing for me.   In a way, I strill do feel stressed. Stressed I didn't get the best ending, stressed I   let everyone down, and that my virtual friends forgot about me.      My one biggest regret though is Shock. When I was in the bunker, everyone and I mean everyone poured their stories and hearts out to me--except him. I hadn't done enough to get his affection, and that was my final mistake.    I should say something analytical about the game. I'd heartily reccomend it to fans who crave a good story, but I would not reccomend it to those like myself who easily get emotionally distressed. There will be a lot of hard desicions to make in this game. I should have seen that coming, at least, do not take the game's warning lightly.  Maybe I'm myself not fit to be a savior. But I'm going to play through this game one more time, and this time I'm going to set things right. I know what to do now. I know what to expect. And I'll do my best to help and bond with everyone. Perhaps then I will feel more at ease, knowing everything is ok. If not, I'm not sure what I'll do. At least, I hope the better ending will put me at ease. Then I can finally rest easy knowing this all wasn't in vain.",
