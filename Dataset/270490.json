            "review_text": "What is The Forest of Doom?  Well, this game is a faithful reproduction of a printed book in the Fighting Fantasy book series (known in Germany as Abenteuer-Spielbuch) by Ian Livingstone. The Forest of Doom was originally published in 1983,  It is a book where you choose what path to follow, i.e. a kind of role playing game. There is an aspect of randomness by dice having to be rolled for battles and luck situations. Some battles can be avoided even by making clever choices. It is hardly comparable to other RPGs since it is a completely different genre, but what can be said is that the game is by nature very short - you can reach the end in an hour even if you play the first time. There are some different paths to explore, making it rewarding to try everything, but in the end it is something you can play only few times.  The video game version adds comfort functions such as an unlockable art gallery and oter extras, but also automatic tracking of your items, dice rolls etc, just like other video games do. All in all I would recommend this for fans of the Fighting Fantasy books or those who look for a nice small RPG to read. The storyline is not deep, but when it first came out it probably was the equivalent of video games in book form. So now we have a video game about a book that emulated video games. Or that emulated casual D&amp;D.  Recommended: For everyone, but at maximum 2 EUR / 2.50 USD  EDIT, 10/17/2015: I feel like I did not describe correctly what the gameplay is about, and also not enough of the nostalgic, the aspect of the classic. The book aspect is that it focuses on the story and gives you a set of choices after each step. It is more akin to a text adventure RPG but with graphical interface and multiple choice. So it is rather simple, and at its time as a book was indeed an equivalent of a full computer game, but nowadays video games have evolved. The book is a timeless classic, one that can be picked up and played - it is, as I said, for everyone. But it also is not long on the PC, you quickly go through everything and everything is automatically taken care of, no writing down stats etc manually. It is probably the best you can ask for to bring this to the PC, but it feels different. Maybe because I'm older, maybe because sitting with a book and paper, trying to draw an own map while going through the book, feels different. All in all you get what you pay for: A text adventure RPG from the master of its craft, 30 years late.  I hope that in 150 years, just like Moby ♥♥♥♥,* just like Pride and Prejudice, this is a classic that very few ever read but everyone knows about. In fact, it already is today to the lovers of such books. In a tight genre like this, almost everything is a classic. But on the PC it is too casual, something that does not hold the same impact anymore as it did when it came out first. For PC games, this one will never be, it is two or three decades too late. If text adventures - not just interactive fiction but real text adventures - would become resurrected, this would be how they could be made easier but still accessible. But they would need to be much longer, that is why I can only recommend the small price. They would need to be epics, things that tell long stories. This one, as much as it hurts, is a typical fantasy setting, something so cliché that it will be forgotten and only the gameplay is what stays in the head.  * = That book with the Whale by Herman Melville, not some guy named Moby's genital. Just so you know what word was censored. :-)",

A short book but It'll be one that I actually read. More over very action packed and leaves you to think before you choose. Dice rules stick to the classic. Although the book doesn't have many visual on several other beasts, you could add custom visuals for the game itself. For those of you who do not like to manually save your game I suggest you Free Read mode (Cheats) ",

            "review_text": "This was actually the first Fighting Fantasy book I ever owned, and I'm glad to see it appear on here. I first saw these games when 'Starship Traveller' appeared in a bundle, and overall they did an excellent job.  What's the story like? Well, it's fairly bog-standard D&amp;D style fantasy, unfortunately. There are a few nice touches such as the wizard Yaztromo who becomes a recurring character in the books, and how some creatures can be bribed rather than fought. But on the whole it's just fight, gold, potions, left or right, fight. This was only book number..3, was it? So they were still finding their feet, but it's a very solid entry in the series despite it's lack of originality.  The actual gameplay is very enjoyable. I was worried that they'd automate too much of it - like if you didn't have a choice in what to do the game would automatically forward you to the next page...and that battles would be just sit-and-watch...but they do a good job. It feels like you're reading the actual book, but with an overlay that takes care of the dice rolls and tracking your progress...so it removes all the tedium without doing too much of the work for you.  The artwork is...well, it's the original artwork in colour so does a good job of providing atmosphere, although it would have been nice if they'd made some more for this release - there are several encounters which don't have any images at all.  The sound is very basic, and the music got on my nerves after a while, though I guess you can turn it off. They also made the mistake of including birdsong in the score, even though the book specifically mentions the lack of wildlife.  Additional stuff is good too - the option to view artwork you've already come across...and the steam achievements are well designed, encouraging you to go back in even when you've finished it to try out new paths and new encounters. There are a lot of creatures and situations that you can miss if you just follow the optimum route.  All in all, I like it. I really do. I'd like to see more in the series brought back this way - there are after all over 150 of them, and we only have 5 interactive books so far...I can't for the life of me work out why they did 'Appointment with F.E.A.R' so soon though. It's really an odd one out in style and tone, and frankly not that great.  'The Warlock of Firetop Mountain' is conspicuous by it's absence though. I thought that it would have been the first to be done. Books I would love to see done this way: 'Deathtrap Dungeon / Trial of Champions' - these two really go hand in hand, 'Island of the Lizard King' - Featuring possibly the most disgusting creature they ever came up with...the Gonchong, 'Temple of Terror' - return of Yaztromo, proper dungeon crawl, 'Demons of the Deep' - Pirates! Skeleton army!, 'Slaves of the Abyss' - Standard fantasy that veers into sci-fi towards the end, 'Dead of Night' - proper Lovecraftian horror with a touch of Geiger  :edit: It seems that 'Warlock' is available...but it's not an interactive gamebook - it's a digital tabletop RPG. And it's also more than 3x the price of these. Meh.",

If you are a hardcore Fighting Fantasy fan, or just kupo for the CYOA genre in general, then yeah there's fun to be found here, but this a book that can be read in 10-15 minutes flat and really shows its age for the type of game it is.   Pick it up on sale if you must, but don't expect award-winning writing here.  ",

It doesn't beat the feeling of opening up the pages of an old book and rolling your own physical dice, but it's faster and more convenient to get into! Great for a quick play, or for those who just don't want to deal with the paper, dice, and pencils.  This is pretty much a 100% accurate recreation, but with added options that can either spice up your experience if you're a veteran of the Fighting Fantasy series, or ease the pain and suffering that awaits you in Darkwood Forest by allowing you to place bookmarks and retrace your steps (aka, make quicksaves). Another huge benefit is a map that completes itself as you play, so you can more easily keep track of where you have and haven't been!  If you don't like reading, and/or are looking for an action packed adventure, this might not be the game for you. It is simply words and numbers, with the occasional piece of artwork. Otherwise... Turn to 177, and begin your adventure!",
