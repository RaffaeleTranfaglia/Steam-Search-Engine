            "review_text": "Blind Trust is a game about working with someone you can barely communicate with, making for an amazing expirience. Although the game is short, it makes up for that with incredible gameplay, and a proof of concept that I hope inspires more people to create games that provide this sort of expirience.   If you play this game, I would highly recommend turning off any and all communcation software to make sure you get the most immersion possible. If not, just don't give any hints or commands to the other person that could make the expirience worse. If you're in the same room as the person you're playing with, then don't let any possible frustration with the Oracle show through to the other person. On the (slightly) bad side, there are a few glitches in the game, but they have been addressed by the developers, so if you follow their instruction, nothing should go wrong.  If you just want a short amazing game for you and a friend, download this game. You have nothing to lose, since the game is free, so just play it!",

There are bugs and it crashed a couple of times while playing the game (Mostly during the start of the game.) None of these were really a big deal. One of the bugs was while the beacon is active, The Monster noises would not play. It is a tiny issue (It really didn't slow us down.) but when half the game revolves around sound. It makes it difficult to get immersed.   Despite all that I highly recommend you play this game anyways. The Concept behind it is amazing and despite the few bugs and crashes we experienced. We legitamitly had fun. Especially when we swapped roles.   This game has potential and I hope the developers fix the bugs, and take this a step further.",

All I remember saying to my friend was 'I am seeing into the cosmos! But I cannot see what is in front of me!' Definitely Fun. The 'Magical Sound Beacons' may need a different sound though, that sound was just enough to drive me on edge as if it was a horror game. (I don't react well to suspense)  The ambient noises were actually pretty cool, it was unfortunate that my friend could not hear them. The running water was rather soothing.  Anyhow I suggest you play this with a firend who really likes co-op games.  I'd love to see a bit of a story come out of this. It would be adorable.

It's a little hard to get into to the game, mostly because you have to download 3rd party content and you have to have a friend (in voice chat) to play with. I would say that once the game is developed more and has been improved this game would be great! There's not much in the game; but using team work to figure out the puzzels is what makes the game what it is. Of course there are things to be improved on. Like maybe instead of having to listen for the soldies ping maybe you could see the turret thingy. I don't know there are alot of things to work on and im just rambling now. Over all i give this game a 6/10 for what it is now. Once it is worked on i might post a higher review.",

It took us a good five tries to even get into the game after frequent crashes and other errors. Once in the game, we played for a good 10-15 and I have to say I was very entertained even while playing as the blind class (Oracle). Though when we decided to switch roles, we had to exit the entire game, which triggered another crash and when we tried to get back into the same game, it would not work.

Also after discovering the download size was low I urged my friends to get it so we could work together on this partner-based game. Not long after that myself and a friend quickly hopped onto the game.... and couldn't connect. Ah, but we weren't in Hamachi. So we both logged into Hamachi and restarted Blind Trust... Still, couldn't connect. A little research told me that the Evolve Software works, rather than Hamachi, so reluctantly my friend and I both downloaded a software that we didn't have to play a little free game, after 2 long chances. Yet, still, we couldn't connect.  I would like to tell you how fun, amazing and artistic Blind Trust is. But the truth is, I can't, I can't because there is nothing I can play to create evidence of such. The game is purely online co-op so I can't even play offline to even get a taste of it.    I do believe that you can play, but only if you have two computers connected to each other on the same  genuine  network and mimics don't work. But I am not sure.  ",

The reason i say this is because their are a lot of bugs with the game such as trying to join a friend with the same network which sometimes doesn't start the game. Another bug is the controls don't work sometimes. One of the other bugs is that the game crashes in the menu randomly and sometimes in game. These bugs really annoyed me and my friend and I won't recommend a frustrating game to people to waste their time on unless you fix this. You should also add some servers for people to play together without same network. You also add more blocking on walls because you can go through some of them and kind of inside of them. PLZ FIX ALL OF THIS ASAP!!",
