The gameplay feels really smooth and well thought out. You can roll, shoot, use luck and all kinds of things. Also, this is the type of game you'll want to play again after you've finished it, so that makes it even more worth my money.",

Luckslinger is a hardcore platformer with tight and addicting gameplay, and has a theme and style that, while great-looking, never takes itself too seriously. The only thing I have to warn you about going into this one is that the difficulty is fairly high in Luckslinger. If you get frustrated by many repeat tries then keep in mind that this is quite a tough game. But if you are good at platformers and love a challenge, then by all means jump on it.

So why the thumbs down? Well, don't get me wrong, this is a pretty good game. I just personally found the difficulty to be ridiculous. I don't mind a game being extremely difficulty, but there's a point where the combination of various aspects drain the fun factor of the game. I feel that Luckslinger suffers from that.  Still, the game is cool. If you think you're up for a challenge, you may enjoy it more than I did.",
