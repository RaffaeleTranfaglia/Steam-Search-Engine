I bought this to play with my girlfriend, we tried, but the unresponsiveness of the controls is way too much, the first thing I noticed is the delay, you press a key and it takes some time for the game to make the movement, this is not really an issue (well, it is for some, but you get used to it), however, the word part is that  the keys stop responding entirely, you press something and the game won't do anything about it",
