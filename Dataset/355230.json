    "description": "Faceted Flight is a stylized stunt flight game designed to deliver the thrill of flight. Take control of the Hover Jet and challenge ghost racers in Ring Attack or just relax and explore Free Flight....or you could always hop into the cockpit of the Jump Seat and give Target Practice a try. What are you waiting for? Do a barrel roll.",
