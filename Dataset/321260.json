    "description": "Wickland is an indie arena shooter heavily inspired by classic FPS games of the 90's. Morph into eight deadly beasts and use their own unique abilities, blaze through maps at insane speed to pick up power-ups, and fight your friends or foes in classic maze-like arena maps, just like the good old days.",

            "review_text": "GREAT GAME!  Only downfall is the player base- there isn't one........ There, from what I can tell, are a few dedicated players who will be on occasionally, but not many. The only game with people on it had 2 people. Other sources confirm that this game has a very small player base. It deserves more. Once you get into a match it is great.  BUT FEAR NOT. Bots can be added in practice mode, so you can just play against them. In the options you can change their skill, 'normal' level bots are not stupid, they put up a fight, easy I assume are, well easy, but the harder difficulties of bots are very competent, very proficiant in killing you.   10/10 this game was made excellently, great everything, gameplay is great, but could do with more people to kill in multyplayer. But I am content with the bots in practice mode.",

            "review_text": "This game shows A TON of potential.  First of all, I want to congratulate the delevopers for not giving up on this game like most companies do with their Early Access titles.  Anyways, here we go.  Graphics: Not bad, really has the 90's arena vibe and best of all, you don't need a good computer to run this game!  Sound: Eh, it's okay - it gets a bit annoying after a while with the constant 'ooh' and 'ugh'. It seems like there is only one sound for each time your character is hit. 'ooh', 'ugh', it never changes.  Characters: Each character has their own set of little moves and powers but it didn't give me any satisfaction (see gameplay). It seems like the character 'Neymar' doesn't really have any useful attacks - choking himself, or clawing (which only works if your opponent is 3 cm away).  Gameplay: Very, VERY fast-paced - essentially a modern 'Quake'. When I said the attacks didn't give me any satisfaction I meant that to kill someone you have to hit them MANY, MANY times, and you will probably run out of ammo before you actually have a chance to kill them. It feels like there isn't any...POWER...behind the powers. It is extremely hard to aim and hit where you want, especially on the insanely-hard AI. Either Neymar or the Archer guy you start out with are probably the most underpowered.   Multiplayer: Good luck on finding ANY players. I've opened the game about 8 times and have played a total of 49 minutes because I've only seen a total amount of THREE players online - at SEPRATE times. 3 times it would just be me and some other guy in the server, and we just end up leaving because there's nobody else to join and we're sick of the AI.  Overall this game does show a lot of potential and it really could be something if the devs stick with it. I know I bashed Wickland pretty hard in this review, but it really isn't a bad game. (Plus, it's still in Early Access) They just need to slow it down a tad, slow the AI down a bit, work on the mechanics slightly and it would be a much more enjoyable experience.   This is an OK game, but it's not worth $10.99 at all. I really want to see this game be more polular, but in it's current state, I don't think it can happen.",

Movement and shooting feels great, bunch of different and nice designed maps, interesting idea of weapons being different characters that you pick up like in other fps arena games.   Game is being slowly developed which means that game is lacking a lot of features. There is no LAN, no BOTs etc.  Anyway, worth picking up while on discount, to have some fun with friends.",

            "review_text": "This game is one of those weird ideas some one came up with while having a conversation on drugs. Sadly this game should have come out in like 2001, then it would have taken off. However in these crappy gaming times a gem like this is hastily over-looked by most anyone without a hardon for Quake style arena shooters and has almost no community that I can find easily. I heartily recommend this game if you can find some people to play with!! One of the most unique weapon systems I've ever encountered! You don't pick up 'guns' you pick up powerups that are like animals, so when you change weapons you actually change your whole body and become a different monster in a paper-rock-scissors style some-are-better-than-others-for-different-things. You can morph from a crab monster to a werewolf! Sounds really different right? Well it is, give it a chance if you're feeling froggy!!!",

Also: spent more time walljumping through ugly and badly designed maps while trickshooting bots. So with all the 'creditibility' I earn from that - I hope I have hurt devs enough and drive away people who might now go play fistful of frags or something else actually good. Post comment here if you are offended bro.  Original review: Another example of 'do-you-even-oldschool-bro': Arena FPS with gimmick - your weapons change your look and act as your armor. It has walljump. That's the definition of oldschool. Yeah! 6 maps. Each of them looks awful. Each of them is too big for 1on1 duel. There is no modding support by the way. No workshop, no SDK, nothing, go away please you pesky modder. LAN through console (server through command-line). I don't think anyone would be interested in playing this thing on LAN but still... very user-friendly. Actually even menu is barebones. Devs ain't put much effort into this thing, I don't know why to build anything at all if you care that 'much' of your game. For example controls configuration menu uses only like 1/16 part of screen. Yeah, it's cheap. It even was free with some promotion. It's of decent quality for it's 'free' price I give it that. You may even have 5-10 minutes of fun if your friends have this crap too. Just don't pay for it - you'll feel robbed. Still it's not like anyone would be interested in this pathetic attempt even if it was free. There is s**tton of better arena FPS games. Even free ones. Hell with it, there is ton of better mods with a lot better designed maps. No one plays it and neither should you. You can shoot some bots tho  p.s.: Why does it called Wickland? Is there some deep meaning? Backstory? Some sprawling intergalactic setting behind that thing?",

And the scripting on the weapons / environmental triggers are just tweaks and reskins of stuff that is already in UT.  Except UT has way more in it. And also players.
