    "description": "Devil's Dare is bloody a smash up parody of everything from the 90s, pitting the manliest video game heroes against the badest monsters from your favorite horror movies. It's the final result of what would happen if everyone from that decade came together to create a baby, a baby that just so happens to grow up to be a beat'em up.",

            "review_text": "Devil's Dare is a smash-em-up, retro game where you fight through zombies, smash through stuff and gather cash which you can use to purchase upgrades with, and more. You can play in single player, or up to 4 players in a co-op mode. To make the game more challenging, the money you earn is also your lifeline to continue should you kick off at some point. Die without having enough money and it's Permadeath, have the cash, and you can revive to fight another day.  Visually, Devil's Dare is a 2D side scroller that looks and feels like a classic 90's beat'em up game. The retro feel is nostaligic for those of us who grew up with these games, and there are easter eggs throughout, referencing stuff from the 80's and 90's including the TMNT. It's not a bad game, and would be fun to play with friends.",

It has a non-linear format where you get to choose your stages, and the bosses and levels actually differ depending on what order you play them in. The game can be difficult at times, but to me, that only means you just need to get better. The game never felt cheap to me in any way. I kinda wish there was online multiplayer (maybe in a future update), but overall, a fun game that's easy to recommend to action fans.",

It'll have you raging at some points of the game, but you realize that it isn't because it's cheesy or cheaty, simply that you're bad. Enough practice and play time will see you right to the end.  I went from not being able to beat any play through of the game to clearing all endings and bosses within a week.   Music is also excellent. Don't let this one slip by, buy it now.",

            "review_text": "Devil's Dare is a pseudo 2D beat em up in which the world has been taken over by a zombie outbreak. It's not dark and gritty though, it is in fact full of references and a bit of silliness. Not really funny though, they are just there to be there. Devil's Dare is made for coop (no online) but is perfectly playable solo and you will initially have four characters to choose from while two more are unlockable. They are all nerds transformed into warriors by Navi from Legend of Zelda and all play pretty differently from one another. Kingstone has a golden axe and is slow and strong, he is capable of summoning lighting, as well as shoulder charging enemies. Queenie fights in a giant mech and is able to freeze enemies and use bombs. Jackson is very fast but barely causes any damage and is able to judo throw enemies across the screen and use a flying kick. Last but not least is Axel who is a jack of all trades, wields the Master Sword and is able to throw a spear chain to drag enemies to him.  Those special attacks can not be used indefinably as using it will cost you one or two bars from your four bar SP meter. It recharges slowly or can be filled bar by bar through defeating enemies. That is something you actually don't want to do if you don't finish them off with a special. Defeating an enemy with a special move causes a “fatality” which causes them to drop money and money is very important in this game. Killing three or more enemies will cause them to drop a health item which makes it a rather easy game. So controlling the crowd is even more important in this game than others of the genre. Annoyingly enough rolling out of the way causes you to lose an SP bar for some reason. Even if the enemy is already knocked down and is no threat at the moment rolling will take off a SP bar. There is no other way to avoid attacks. There is no jumping, parrying or blocking, and insanely enough the run button is the same as the dodge which means to run you will first dodge out of the way using up an SP bar and only then you can run for a while. You can rebind keys but you can not separate those two from using the same key. It may sound like a petty complaint but is actually quite annoying given the importance of being able to pull of a special attack but having to wait for it to refill.  Getting hit is very brutal in this game. One hit and you will be stunned while enemies combo you into oblivion. You can escape by sacrificing all four bars of your SP bar to pull of a special attack to escape from their grasp. Most enemies take plenty of time telegraphing their attack so you will have a lot of time to roll away from harm before anything happens. Enemy variety is quite decent ranging from your typical zombie to a pregnant women that flings undead babies at you. There is one slime like enemy that if it manages to hit you will reverse your controls. I absolutely hate that in video games. Stun me or whatever but do not mess with the controls. Especially if your games controls are already subpar to begin with. It is hard to explain just what is wrong with them but it feels like there is a very big delay in the time that you press a button and the time it takes for it to register. It's not gamebreaking but in all my time playing I have not stopped noticing it. Another problem is that the pick up key is the same as the basic attack so if you are attacking an enemy and move near money you will break your combo, bend over to pick up a few dollars and get a shiny new bite mark on your ♥♥♥. He will also pick up money over food oddly enough.  There are 4 boss fights in this game all from popular 80's films and are pretty fun to fight. Not much of a challenge by itself though. There will always be a unlimited horde of zombies attacking you during boss fights so I found it best to just ignore them unless I need health and focus on the boss. If you need extra challenge there are 3 difficultly modes to chose from, the first “Casual” will disable achievements, “Classic” is best suited to start with, and “Expert” features some special different colored enemies that can not be stun locked. Expert gives you the choice before levels to make monsters and bosses harder for extra reward but that just means you can't stun lock them and didn't really add much. Boss fights are were most of the challenge comes from and are all pretty entertaining to fight though there was one instance where I glitched out of the level on the last boss fight which was infuriating though did not happen again. They also give you a limited amount of time to fight the boss and if you surpass that time you will automatically die so hopefully you have money left to respawn. It usually doesn't take that long to take down a boss if you ignore the grunts and head right for him but with lower damage based characters like Jackson it can feel like an unnecessary nuisance. Like every other enemy you should try to finish the boss with a fatality for a big cash reward at the end.   One of the most unique features of this game is that you can choose any of the four stages to play right from the get go. The longer you put off a level the more nights (sections) it will have. The first stage you pick will only have one night, the second will have two nights, third will have three and so on. That is a really cool feature that adds plenty of replay value if you want to see all the stages. It also means you will have more encounters with that stages boss. If you were disappointed that everyone's favorite alien was a push over, just save his stage for last and you will have much better encounters with it. None of the stages look interesting visually though and are all quite cliché. Stages are “Sewers”, “Train”, “Hallway” and “The Road which are every bit as boring as they sound. Something that they pull off constantly is throw waves and waves of enemies at you before you get to move from that screen space, to mask how short the levels are and it makes it feel tedious. The brown filter that they added over the game makes everything look dull and lifeless, it really contradicts the goofy nature of this game as well as makes it look terrible for no reason. After a night is over you get to purchase a upgrade like more health, longer combos, a soul token that lets you continue from the last night if you lose. One cool feature is that each character have some of there own unique upgrades special to him/her like upgrading a Molotov special attack into using a flamethrower. The two unlock-able characters use guns instead of melee and after a certain amount of shots they need reloading. Can be slightly annoying opening crates and trying to pick up items only to lose a round by accident.  Be warned, if you want to face the last fifth boss and get the good ending you will need $6666 to face him. There is also a survival mode which pits you against waves of enemies that get stronger with each wave, it is a nice little addition if you just want to have a quick game. Devil Dare's soundtrack ranges from decent to amazing and I enjoyed it very much. Voice acting on the other hand was painful to listen to but I guess it fits in with the cheesiness of the game. There is no long winded dialogue thankfully. Just small extremely cheesy quips during battle. Overall I did enjoy this game but it always felt like I was fighting the game itself more so than anything. From the need to finish enemies off with a special attack but sometimes not having any SP due to the only form of avoiding enemy attacks using 25% of the SP bar after each use to the wonkiness of the controls and the inability to cancel out an animation to dodge or attack another enemy approaching from the back. It had potential but is ultimately held back from some rather odd design decisions. A few patches may easily negate most of my critiques but at it's current state at the time of this review the issues stack up just enough for me to not recommend.",

It freezes constantly - froze once right when I started the tutorial, then again when I tried to start the first level. And even when the game works, it still suffers from constant slowdowns for no reason at all (and I have a good PC, so it's not hardware issues).  I looked on the forums and among other reviews to see if I could find a solution to this problem. From what I've read around, not only did I not find anything, but it also seems the devs have abandoned the game. Hopefully this isn't true.  Still, a shame. The game had such potential.",

            "review_text": "Genre - Retro Side Scrolling Beat 'em up When I saw this game advertised I had high hopes. I grew up playing games like Double Dragon and Golden Axe with friends. This appeared to replicate the feel of these game and add in-jokes to films and retro game characters. I purchased it at £7.99 thinking I was bound to get my monies worth and I love supporting Indie games.  However, when I loaded the game up everything seemed far from polished. My Xbox controller would not work even though this is clearly an arcade game. I had to go into settings and map the keys. Okay not the end of the world but still a bit of a pain, Then I chose my first character playing solo (Golden Axe) on the sewer level he seemed okay once I got used to the moves via the tutorial and my adventure began. Having the screen set to full screen I wandered around killing mobs. This was quite fun and I found I could get food by doing certain moves at the right time. A few traps got in the way but nothing that couldn't be avoided. Then I got to the boss (The Fly basically). He seemed challenging but I wasn't expecting a walk in the park (as I knew this was old skool). I dragged him to the center of the screen to hit him. Then he started getting harder as they sometimes do and after dying for the firts time I realised he was able to fly out of my field of view and shoot me. I had to follow him into the dark and try and hit him. This was mostly a failure and I died. After experimenting a bit more with the game I realised that for some reason the game settings mean I can't see what is going on the left and right hand side of the game. Basically I will be unable to beat any bosses alone whilst this exists and this game is just another pointless number in my collection. Even if this was fixable I think I would find this game un-inspiring for the price and would rather play some of the other old skool beat 'em ups like the Double Dragon re-boot or the Sacred attempt. Sorry for a negative review but that's just the way I feel, disappointed...",

            "review_text": "Hmmm... The game is worth its price (though I got it on sale). I think the content and the gameplay was good and it really takes some strategic thinking to avoid getting hit and to keep your HP healed up. If you're smart about it you can get through the entire game without dying.  There are two things that make me not recommend the game. Controller sensitivity appears to come either too high and you make movements you did not intend resulting in completely different special attacks or that you get stuck on environmental objects. Your character has to stand in place to swing their weapon so stopping to destroy and object when enemies are on your tail can be deadly.  Honestly, what tipped me further into this direction is that I made it all the way to day 9 and was in an elevator level. I got knocked into a environment box and was clipped into the floor then transported back in time to get knocked off the platform and die. I can accept defeat from standing too close to an edge while fighting on normal circumstances but when it looks like I got glitched into that situation is just annoying.",
