            "review_text": "TL;DR Game is good and balanced, if not appealing to everyone  First of all, Painkiller: Black Edition is almost universally accepted as the better game. If you're gonna choose only one, get the original (also on steam).  The rest of this review is the BS people are complaining about.  Now to the people complaining about difficulty, weapons, etc. Yes the weapons are a little weak, but you get so much ammo and all of the enemies can be lead like sheep. You can hold every weapon at once and always have the melee/death-ray cube thing with unlimited ammo (its ♥♥♥♥ing strong too), so if you have ammo issues, your aim is abysmal. Really abysmal.  As for the difficulty: Enemies with melee attacks are strong because they should never catch up to you. Seriously, you can bunny hop more than twice as fast as they walk. You even slide up and over enemies when you jump.. Even when you do get hit it takes at least 10 hits to kill you from the standard 100 HP (max HP is something between 150-250, I've never really paid attention) PLUS armour.. And if you still can't handle the enemies, there's a difficulty setting for a reason.  The load times are fine. The one guy saying the times are 10+ minutes must have a hamster instead of a processor. The load times are a little longer than most, but theyre fine.  Enemy variants are plentiful (new enemies every level so far).  Overall there are 17 levels, 20 minutes or more each. Even rushing through the game, you get 5+ hours of gameplay.  Recomended (but Painkiller: Black beats Overdoes)",

            "review_text": "If you're looking for a challenging, fast paced old school FPS with cool weapons, tonnes of enemies to kill and a great art design, Painkiller Overdose is the game for you. There are lots of collectables to find along the way, rewarding players for exploring the maps. This keeps the pacing of the gameplay steady and allows you to take a few deep breaths after murdering countless demons and trust me, you'll need to. Enemy ai isn't the best but they will team up to ko you. Some enemies have tricks up their sleeve to be careful of. Plus there are many environmental hazards to look out for such as lava, swinging maces etc. There are also tarot cards to collect which give you special powers when activated once per level. These cards are permenant and you can unlock them by satisfying certain conditions at the end of a level. The weapons are cooler than ever, you will get some really creative ones to try as well as your conventional shotgun. Levels are well designed and have lots of hidden ammo/secrets and tonnes of enemies to kill.  Another thing to note is that the protagonist, Belial who just happeneds to be a demon/angel hybrid is a far more entertaining character than Daniel and has the tendancy to deliver one liners every now and again, particularly after consuming his favourite food, evil souls and he makes this very clear.  The only downsides are the framerate drop which often occurs when enemies spawn into the map. This can be annoying and can break you away from the action sometimes. Plus the enemy ai can be pretty stupid when it comes to pathing, something you'll find in most painkiller titles, enemies will lose track of you easily. Also be careful with your saves. always delete the ones you don't need as the game has the tendancy to corrupt data and crash the game when too many sames are accumilated. One level in particular, Animal Farm has an awful save glitch which can corrupt data randomly on that level, basically you're required to beat it all in one sitting with no deaths as i guarrentee 80% of the time, the checkpoint autosaves will get corrupted, if you want to get the tarot card on that level, i strongly reccommend playing it on daydream to save yourself the frustration of dying and having to return to the beginning of the level.  Other than that, this game is worth picking up if you are looking for a cheap old school shooter with a twist. Pick up the black edition too.",

            "review_text": "I had a great time with Painkiller Overdose and I still play it to improve my scores and try higher difficulties. I have tried Black Edition and I agree it's the better version, but this game has a quicker more arcade feel to it that I enjoy.  For those unfamiliar with this series, Painkiller is a fast paced arena style FPS (first person shooter), and I would compare it to Quake 3 in terms of controls and jumping.  There are 17 maps in 3 chapters (or so) with a couple bosses and tons of unique and creative enemies. You have a lot of weapons to use, and some hidden secrets and pickups in the maps. You will find some weapons work better on enemies than others as you play which is quite satisfying. This game has great sound effects, great graphics, and lots of blood and gore.  Multiplayer is dead unless you add friends to play with and play via IP address. Gamespy ran the master servers but they have been taken down. You may encounter problems hosting if you are using a router.  Overdose is cheaper than Black Edition, don't pass this one up, it's very fun.",

This is a really good follow up to Painkiller: Black Edition. Most of the new weapons ARE reskins, but there are still a handful of completely new ones. Also this game is a good deal more difficult then the first one so beware. One of my favorite things about this is the incredible variety of enemies/locations you get to see. Even more so then the first Painkiller.",
