            "review_text": "TL/DR This is a good game for:   People that love point and click games   People that want to love point and click, but are not good at them   People interesting in the subject of Marco Polo or the Silk Road   LONGER  This is a well-designed and executed point and click game. I am NOT GOOD at point and click games but in this one, there is just enough logic in each sequence to figure it out. The in-game help system is also well designed.   The in-game help system is well thought out, and only releases a single clue with each mouse click. So instead of revealing the entire point and click sequence at once (and ruining that screen), the in-game help just release a single clue at a time. If you're really stuck then sure reveal the entire sequence, but maybe you figured most of it out except one thing.   The puzzles are also reasonable. There is a pattern that can be deduced, and there is a hint with a timer if you can't find the last one of 'find X pieces of the map'. type puzzles. A few puzzles can also be skipped entirely.   There are a few screens where historical information is shared about technology brought back to the West from China.   As others have mentioned the game is short, but worth it.",
