There are much better mobile runners FOR FREE. I dont think i would even recommend this game even if it was free. You are running away from a badly animated magma wave, with a badly modeled character. Thats it. No unlockables. No achievements. Just the same randomised runs. I played this for 5 mins and i already got bored. I got this as a freebie, so i don't feel so bad about getting this. But you probably shouldn't buy it. Go play canabalt. A much better game.  1/10  EDIT: If you still wanna buy the game, you should know that, you start on a small window and there arent any resolution options in the game.",

The combination is almost non-intuitive on keyboard (V or left mouse button to jump, i hope I remember them correctly, I've played under 10 mins) and the game requires cat like reflexes, because the obstacles and enemies comes way to fast, even on training on the lowest level of dificulty.",
