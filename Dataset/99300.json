            "review_text": "Firstly, the context of my experience with this game. I bought the four pack for myself and some friends. My first playthrough was with one buddy and we played through all nine missions over two nights on the medium difficulty without much trouble. Next we will do the hardest difficulty and we will try the DLC which we immediately bought after our first playthrough. Eventually I will get two more friends on for this game and probably play through on solo as well.  Secondly, the positives. This game is simple fun. The basics of the game are: an arrow points towards your mission objective, you follow the direction the arrow is pointing and blow ♥♥♥♥ up along the way. The mechanics of the game make it easy to play so you can enjoy the action and focusing on not getting killed.  The story and cutscenes are hilarious and enjoyable. Never once did I find myself saying, 'Oh no another cutscene.' Infact it was the opposite. I truly enjoyed every single one. Bryant is a badass. The ending to this game is, in one word, AMAZING. Best ending ever? Probably.  Thirdly, some comments in general. At first I had some issues with the controls. The default controls are set up such that W moves you towards the top of the screen, S towards the bottom, A to the left, and D to the right. This is really counter intuitive. Luckily there is an easy way to change this. Simply turn on tank steering in the options. Once that option is enabled W moves you forward, S backwards, A turns to the left, and D turns to the right.  Some have criticized the mission timers that appear occasionally when you are playing. I am unsure why they find these unenjoyable. Firstly, through my entire first play through I think I saw a timer maybe 6 times. This game isn't about exploration. It is about fast-paced action. You get more points for doing more damage in a short period of time. You always want to be moving forwards to the next objective. Not to mention the fact that the timer isn't arbitrary. It is usually tied directly to a mission objective. IE Destroy the tanks before they reach the town. The timer was never a challenge for me, it was more of a reminder to get the primary mission done.  Finally, the negatives. I found the game quite easy. Dying wasn't really a punishment as you just respawn a short distance from where you died and lose some of your power ups which you can quickly reclaim. During my entire first playthrough I did not get a game over once and did not struggle at all to do things within the time limit. The game being easy had the benefit of allowing me to just enjoy the action and story of the game. In short it was a nice casual playthrough. I hope the hardest difficulty puts up a good fight.  Also, I would say the game is too short. I am not saying the game is not worth the money, far from it. I got my moneys worth out of this game. I just wish there was more. I wish there was more DLC and more missions. I wish this game wasn't over so fast. I wish there was more story and more Bryant. I would follow that guy into hell and back.  So that is my review of the game. I hope you find this helpful.  TL:DR;  Fast-paced arcade style blow ♥♥♥♥ up game + Awesome Story, Great Action, Great Gameplay - Too Easy? Short  Turn on Tank Steering if you plan to play with keyboard.",

            "review_text": "This game is neither good nor bad. It's definitely in between. I would recommend doing some homework before you consider buying it (especially at full price). If I were younger (pre-teens to teens) I would most likely be all over this game. The redundancy of simply running here, getting civilians then blowing this up can really turn a gamer off. Some gamers however, do like games where you simply make things go boom. The  gameplay  is actually quite decent and may pull some players in. I know the local co-op will definitely raise a few eyebrows.  The game follows a top-down format in which you drive a car. The  gameplay  overall isn't that bad. The left stick drives the car while the right stick shoots (shooting in the direction you are pointing). Different cars have differing abilities. Gordon Freeman (from Half-Life) is a feature character on the steam version and his ability is to dispatch 3 headcrabs which attack enemies. Roxy has the ability to deploy airstrikes which is quite effective. Armand has the ability to use shields (yay how exciting to play defense). Diz is able to literally shut down enemies with her EMP ability. Gunnar has the ability to use a heavy cannon that deals a good amount of damage (however he cannot move while using this ability). Gunnar is pretty cool but so far Roxy and Gordon and the most fun to play with (in my opinion of course)! On top of having these abilities, players are able to boost with A. This is a nice addition as going from one side of the map to another to pick up civilians or to make a time limit can be tough without this ability. The game likes to deploy weapon drops that add an additional weapon to your arsenal. Some of these weapons include a flame thrower or a limited amount of rockets that deal a decent amount of damage.  In addition to basic abilities given to characters, there is an RPG element to the game. Players can choose from three categories to upgrade their specific character : defense, offense and tactical. Each character has slightly different upgrades. In general, defense deals with upgrades such as spare parts (that spawn health pickups when your hit) or doubling up on nitro for a quick get away. In general for offense, some upgrades include starting off with consumable weapons (such as rockets or rail guns), auto-reload or ammo surplus. In general for tactical, cool-downs for specials can be reduced, things like ram-plates can be added as well as counter-shots. You need to cause some mayhem to get some ability points!  Missions generally consist of either defending or attacking certain targets while attempting to extract civilians. It's almost impossible to go off course unless they give you a secret path to follow. Some missions will have you get into a helicopter and start attacking from the air. I think it's really cool that the game attempted to mix things up a bit and give the player a different sense of control. The problem here for me is some of this becomes redundant and is a complete deterrence for my friends and I to continue playing. I'm glad they at least added the ability to drive into houses and knock them down. Adds a little more to the atmosphere.  The  visuals  are pretty decent. Nothing less than ordinary or extra-ordinary. The helicopter graphics I feel could have been a lot better. The  sounds  are decent as well and do not go over and above. The dialogue is okay but can get corny at times.  Overall, it's not a bad game. I have tolerance for a lot of games but most friends I have played local with neither dislike or like the game. More dislike than like the game. I will recommend it but with a big 'BEWARE' sign.

Normal mode is much better all around and perfectly playable for a n00b to the genre like me :)  Ranking the cars up can feel a little tedious to be honest, I've played for 6 hours and have one car at about rank 35 out of 50. I think there are 6 cars so choose which one you want and stick with it i guess, you get bonuses like extra lives / health / ammo / special ability is stronger etc.  Coop gets things going slightly mental... in a good way, it definately adds to the experience, grab the 4 pack offer and play with your mates.",

Multiplayer is definitely where the fun is, easy to get going (except when Steam is down) and no major problems with lag. On the down side, there are a few issues with odd bugs, some even causing the game to crash. Also, a decision on the part of the developers has you able to hoover up health packs for some measly points when at full health - which is fine in single player, but can really duff up a good multiplayer game when your average driver is drawn to anything shiny like five-year-olds round an ice cream van.",

Second try was with Xbox controller. I was hoping it'll be fine now, but I got surprised again - with gamepad playing is at all possible, but it's still fully unintuitive and very hard to handle. Person responsible for this should be fired from work and then burn in hell. Seriously I've played many games of this type and Renegade Ops steering is worst I've ever seen! At all it's a very poor PC port of an console game.",

I play on PC without a controller and hardly have any issues. The only real issue is control while using the speed boost but its really not that bad once you get used to it.

Pick a vehicle with the perk to suit your style and head out for some top-down mayhem. It's an arcade style shooter, so there is no saving your progress through levels. Once you clear a level, you can thereafter choose to revisit it, but not until.  The one negative: the price. I can't say this game earns full price, maybe not even half.
