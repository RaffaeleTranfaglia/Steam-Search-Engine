            "review_text": "It may not have been the prettiest child, even back when first released, But my word this was a brilliant game. one of the few RTS's where it feels truly free form in how you tackle each level. ( after the first couple of tutorial levels at least)  Rarely a more satisfying gaming moment beats seeing your enemies sprawling base in uncontrollable flames.  The only downside to this game is the annoying graphical glitching of the units, If anyone can solve that it would be much appreciated!  Despite that, Its still very very playable. I look forward to Warrior Kings : Battles joining it on here soon ( I hope! )",

            "review_text": " PROS:  + cool campaign story + various campaign paths + building &amp; unit tech trees + unit formations make a difference + battleground choice matters + fun multiplayer + flaming arrows!   CONS:  - clunky &amp; outdated graphics - graphical glitches - some AI bugs - hard to set up a mulitplayer game   Comment:  Old gem in the RTS genre. Played it back in 2004 and 10 years later it's still fun. If you don't mind the graphical flaws and love various possibilities to conquer your foes with armies (or well-placed fire arrows, hehe) then this game is for you.",
