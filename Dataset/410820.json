            "review_text": "Honestly the graphics turned me off a bit when I first discovered this title, but since it came highly recommended by a befriended shmup'o'holic I decided to give it a try. I'd further like to elevate that this little gem comes with a very reasonable pricetag.  Let's start by saying that Starward Rogue is really overwhelming cool! The bullet patterns are sheer madness and indicate that whosoever did them really did his homework properly and thus developed a unique approach to something well known and liked.  The coreplay itself is very fast and fluid, a difficulty setting and different types of armor make it very approachable for beginners and long-term-fans to the genre as well. The vast amount of different weapon, perk and skill combinations make it become a decent overall gaming experience that due to it's clever but simple design comes with tons of replay value.   A great plus is that some of the actual game content is inspired by it's community. On top of that the developers have a very active external forum that includes the most precise and cool changelists I came across so far. Updates seem very frequently and are rolled out quick.   6 Different saveslots, not like Nihon Falcom but still very much appreciated and certainly enough.  Comes with MOD support, and even though I got no clue were to get them and what they will do you are able to redeem ingame codes as well.   TLDR if you like shmups or always wanted to experience first handed how it feels to get your brain melted by dancing through a multi coloured ocean of bullets this is a blindhit, go, buy, enjoy.  Last but not least, thanks to my mate 'Fishsticks' for giving me a poke into this games direction!",

            "review_text": "Disclosure: I got sent a beta key for this.  I enjoyed this so much that I decided to make a video on it - you can find that   here  .  Overal, I was pleasantly suprised by this game. It reminded me of the Binding of Isaac, crossed with the Sparx levels from Spyro: Year of the Dragon.  The attacks where really well telegraphed, which helped both the feel of progression through the game and also made bosses very fun. The music, while not my taste, was well suited. The bosses where the highlight for me, being large open room bullet hell bosses with phases felt great, especially considering how much control you have over your movement.  The different weapon types was enjoyable and made picking up new items fun. I liked the idea of the energy weapon the most, as I just got to spam it every room which felt great. The difficulty is very well tuned, as I felt I was learning on normal difficulty but it was still challenging to get through dungeons.  The varied mech-suit (things?) is very nice for replayability and specific playstyles.  I didn't really have anything negative to add. Apart from the music, but that's subjects (and you can just turn it off!). Even though I'm bias because I got the game for free, overall I would be happy to have bought this game - it's one of the few games that I've reviewed that I actually want to go back and play (not to mention that I spent more time than I thought I would playing to write this)!

That said, it's an 'excellent' Binding of Isaac clone. It manages to mesh shoot-em-up tropes really well with the typical loot/dungeon mechanics of that franchise. It never manages to feel like a 'cheap knock off', and does bring it's own flavor to the roguelike-ish dungeon genre.  Recommended if you like shoot-em-ups, or if you like Binding of Isaac, or both.",

            "review_text": "A surpringly solid twin-stick shooter which takes inspiration from the best of the genre but doesn't just blindly follow in their footsteps.  Despite being pretty skeptical about Arcen pulling it off, I've conclued very fast that, fortunately, it is a pretty fun game! You can choose from 6 mechs who have different stats and some of which also start with some weapons or special skills that makes them unique. One of the mechs literally turns the game into SUPERHOT. For the uninitiated, SUPERHOT is a FPS where time flows only when you move so it basically turns from frantic battle for survival into a very chill experience.  Each mech has 4 slots, primary weapon with infinite ammo, secondary energy weapon with limited usage that refills upon entering a new room, limited ammo weapon like a rocket launcher that functions like bombs in Binding of Isaac for breaking stuff/killing enemies in emergency and lastly a consumable slot. Apart from that you can find drops that just upgrade or modify your mech without being restricted to slot.  The game starts you off at 5 floors in total, each floor is very Isaac-like with shops, miniboss rooms, secret rooms and floor boss. You also gain experience, upon leveling up you can choose a perk like becoming the Keymaster and getting 100 keys, seeing the non-special and later special rooms automatically on map or learning you gottagofast. Yes, game actually has sprint button for traversing long distances AND for use in boss fights. Some of them like the Hunter miniboss will actively chase you at higher-than-normal speed so you gotta put those mech legs to work.  The enemies use bullet hell patterns but on normal they are mostly avoidable even for someone like me who doesn't play typical bullet hell games like the Touhou series. That is, at least not until you increase the difficulty and/or get to the later floors. The difficulties alter enemy and boss patterns, among other things, which is really cool way to do difficulty tiers in general.  Overall, the game has pretty rad soundtrack even if it can get a bit repetitive during a longer session and solid gameplay with plenty to do on each floor and bosses that don't feel like copypasta of each other.  It's a good choice of a time-waster whether you've already played all the usual suspects or just getting into the genre. Highly recommended!",

Like all Arcen's games, it's a genre mash up , this time between boi-like roguelike and a bullet hell shmup with the higher difficulties aiming to be more bullet hell than roguelike.  The game stands out due to it's excellent selection of robots that vary hugely, excellent level design and delighful controls.  Suggest purchasing if you like BoI/Bullet Hell/Arcen fan in general.

There are often temporary buffs that only last while a condition is fulfilled, there are optional goals you can find as pickups (e.g. complete level with 0 credits remaining to get 50 credits, 1 key and 40 exp)... I played 3 hours today. It's my first day playing.  I love this game. Screw Binding of Isaac. It's been replaced by this game and its neon mech awesomeness.",

            "review_text": "(Review updated on August 14th 2016)  Now that I beat the 3 wardens and finally completed a full run, I think it's a good time to write a small review.  The game is a healthy mix of roguelite and bullethell. Think Binding of Isaac with mechs and lasers, where the huge selection of enemies all have very unique styles of attacks. But don't get scared by the Bullethell tag, it's not the 'barf bullets all over your screen and call it a day' bullethell, it's more like 'each pattern is a little puzzle you have to solve to dodge it' bullethell.  Controls are tight, which I think is pretty crucial for a game like this. I do recommend activating the option called 'Use SHMUP-style controls' so you can stop your movements at a moment's notice. You'll be glad you did during most boss fights.  Difficulty-wise, the 5 levels of difficulty available before each run can give players of all skill levels a fun time.  -Very Easy: Enjoy the ride and learn at your own pace -Easy: Quite forgiving -Normal: Challenging -Hard: Punishing -Misery: Still in preparation, but a good description for it when it will be released should be 'OH GOD, WHY?!'  For each run, you get to select a mech to use from a selection of 7 so far. You got the treasure hunter mech for extra cash and stuff, the flame tank to get a strong starting kit, the time manipulating mech that lets you stop the action to think/plan for a bit, the vanilla mech that's good at everything but doesn't have anything special per say, the magnetic mech that can break through any bullet pattern, the energy mech which can fire its secondary weapon for extended periods of time and finally, the humble mech that is all about shop discounts and money.  Weapons/items variety is pretty good from what I've seen. (Up to 260 so far if I look at the ingame menu) Which weapon would you pick? A super fast machinegun or a powerful flamethrower or a fancy phaser that can shoot through walls? Add to that a secondary energy weapon and a bunch of upgrades/modifiers and things can get crazy. Crazy fun that is. Consumable items were a bit underwhelming/overpriced, fortunately those were tweaked in an update and are now quite desirable/effective.  Graphic-wise, the game looks clean and colorful. You can spot enemy bullets without issue and it's easy on the eyes. What's not to love?  For the story, the tutorial does a good job of quickly explaining what's going on and what is expected of you. I thought the voice acting was pretty neat and the humor well dosed, but opinions on that may vary. It's short and pretty straightforward, but I personally like it that way.  The music isn't really my genre, but still found it well done and enjoyable. Doesn't detract from the experience and adds to it instead. There's a lack of variety in the number of music tracks available, but I remember reading the devs were planning on adding more later. So hopefully we'll get more tracks from their very talented music composer in the future.  Modding: The devs took extra care to make it easy for the community to make their own content for the game if they so desire. New enemies, new items, new mechs, new room layouts, new bosses, etc. I always appreciate it when devs put the effort to allow easy modding. I ended up making quite a few custom mechs of my own and it was indeed very easy.  Bugs and balance: Since this is an Arcen game, if something seems weird or just not fun, you can report it and the devs will listen. Plus, those guys are ridiculously fast at releasing updates. You reported getting stuck because of a glitch? Don't be surprised if you get an update a mere few hours later, fixing your issue the same day. How awesome is that?  Oh my, this review got a bit lengthy after all. In conclusion, it's a very good Isaac-style roguelite with a very satisfying bullethell aspect that will keep you coming for one more run, over and over. Pure, concentrated fun filled game. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "I'm personally not a huge fan of bullet hell type games, but I can't deny that Starward Rogue is well put together and enjoyable.  You pick a mech, choose your preferred difficulty, and head into a dungeon. Each mech has various pros and cons that set it apart from the others, and the difficulty choices encompass all types of players, whether you want a casual experience or a gruesome challenge.   Dungeons consists of various rooms. Most have enemies in them, which you have to kill before proceeding further, others have some kind of puzzles or obstacles such as lasers that go on and off in a pattern. You also pick up a variety of items and equipment for your mech to improve them for the duration of the run. At the end of the floor there's a boss, which you have to defeat in order to be able to descend to the next floor. Bosses all have unique attack behaviours and are generally very fun to fight. I'd say, this game is very similar to Binding of Isaac, except in a sci-fi setting.   Visuals are very pretty and shiny, despite being very simplistic. At first some stuff can be a tad confusing, like the glass floors overlooking space at first seemed like death drops/impassable places to me and it's not often easy to tell which of the obstacles are destructable and which aren't. Music is all right too. There are some nice upbeat tunes here and there, but I think the music in other Arcen games is way better.  It's a simple but fun gameplay. Don't expect deep tactics and strategy like in other Arcen games (such as Bionic Dues and The Last Federation), but if you just want to have some fast-paced fun and challenge your reflexes, then the game is well worth getting. It is a welcome change to see an indie dev that changes the formula in each of their games and does something new rather than churning out clones all the time.",
