I'm well beyond getting a refund but even paying 65 cents for it feels like an incredible waste. I've spent 25 cents on games with more content than this.  Another annoying bit: There is nothing telling you what any of the controls actually do. Only my accident did I discover I could heal myself by hitting right click. Yes. Heal...and elongate my eternal torment.",
