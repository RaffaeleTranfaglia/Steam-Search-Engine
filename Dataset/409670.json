Granted, it's meant as a short interactive commercial for Kero Blaster, but it's still a damn nice retroesque platformer that's strangely reminiscent of  Kirby  in a way. The physics are great, controls and music are fantastic. I kinda wish this was a little bit longer, but it does its job (as capitalistic as it is).  It's definitely worth the five-to-ten minutes to play through.",
