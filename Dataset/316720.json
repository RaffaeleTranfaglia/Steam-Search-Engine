This is the game's strongest point, and I have to admit I broke down twice while reading it. - Short (~4 hours), but this works to the game's favor as it doesn't outstay its welcome  I can recommend this without hesitation to anyone who wants a memorable experience, even if they're not into visual novels. I know I won't forget about this game for a long time. Just remember to keep your tissue box handy, you'll need it.",

            "review_text": "planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~ is a kinetic visual novel (meaning that there are no player choices to make) that takes place in a future dystopia where humanity is almost extinct so there are very few survivors. 'Junkers' are one of those few and basically, they take items and goods from cities that have long been abandoned. One such Junker finds his way inside a 'sarcophagus city,' which is basically a city that has long since been uninhabited. In his attempt to find more supplies, he finds his way into a planetarium, one that had been spared from the destruction that the War and afterwards, the Rain had caused upon the rest of the city as well as everywhere else on the planet. (I'd explain what the War and the Rain are but that's better left for when you play the game itself.) Inside that planetarium, there is a companion robot who continues to work there, unaware of what has happened to humanity and the planet since the people have long since abandoned the city. I won't spoil more on what happens after the Junker's initial encounter with the robot Hoshino Yumemi but I will say that this story is at least partially about the relationship that the Junker (unnamed throughout the story) and Yumemi form.  Since I'll hold off on giving more spoilers, I'll go ahead with my review. I really enjoyed planetarian a lot. It has a very emotional story and the writing was excellent. There were very few proofreading errors but I liked reading the text along with listening to the voice acting, which was great. The voices conveyed the emotion of the characters, who were mainly the Junker and Yumemi. The art was beautiful, in the usual manga style, and I liked the visual effects, especially the ones of the falling rain. The various music tracks were beautiful, too, and all of the elements (writing, music, art, etc.) just fit so well together to tell a beautiful, sad story. I did end up crying at the end although I can't reveal why since that would be a major spoiler. Although planetarian was short, it definitely touched my heart.   Overall, I'd recommend giving planetarian a try. If you want a story to immerse yourself in, to enjoy as you sit back and watch, then this is for you. Although I did find it sad, I'd say that it was more emotional overall, as it stirred other feelings in me, too. I could go on some more about other things that I liked, such as the eventual planetarium presentation, but I think it's better for you to buy it and give it a go. ^^",

This is a visual novel that is filled with emotion and I must say that key did a good job in this game.  I enjoyed the anime and this is the same but the feels could not be stopped even when I have watched the anime. I find that the tears was flowing like a lake when I was reading this VN and I enjoyed it deeply that I read every word that was in the text. Some of the words are bugged, unreadable but overall I must say this is a great experience to people who enjoy VN.     To anyone that really enjoy reading, this is suitable for you are be prepare to have a packet or even a roll of tissue as tears are really leaking right now even when i'm writting this review.   I would totally recommend this game to everyone that enjoys VN and reading. GL as now my shirt is totally wet with tears.",

(Since I read all three of those manga and have watched the anime, plus 'know' the types of stories Key puts out, I knew what I was getting into even before I bought this 'game'. Let us just say I knew what type of ending this would have before I started, and bought it anyway.)  Storyline: A Junker (a scavenger, really) on a future post apocalytic Earth accidently (and quite possibly by fate) runs across a non-lethal still functioning companion robot named Hoshino Yumeni. Yumeni is the caretaker of a department store planetarium. (I am sure the word, planetarian, in the title is simply a misspelling.) Still performing her duties as greeter and narrator, Yumeni greets 'Mr. Customer' formally and politely. She offers to show him a special presentation of 'the starry sky', a sky which in reality is covered with perpetually falling toxic rain. There in that forgotten planetarium in the middle of a biologically contaminated and abandoned lethal 'Sarcophagus City' patrolled by murderous mechanized war machines these two share a reverie (a daydream) of a once and 'future' world.  Excellent story, and have a box of tissue handy.",

            "review_text": "So I picked this little game on sale, knowing it was from Key. And in case you don't know, this studio likes to literally ♥♥♥♥ with your feels. So I knew what I was going into.  So, what is this game? This is a kinect visual novel, that means it literally is a book with pictures, music and voice acting. In most VN you can choose your own ending by making choices that affect it. Here, it is just like normal book: one plot line from the beggining to the end.  What is the story? It is about man, imply called 'Jumker', who once visits planetarium, where lonely robot, called Hoshino Yumemi, wants to show your stars, but unfortunetely, the projector is broken. I believe that is all you need to know about this game. I was certainly suprised how grimm this story is and even more of its setting. I highly recommend you to NOT read the summary and/or tags, I think it kinda ruins the whole suprise thing. But why? Because the story is so touching that you should experience the bad things as you play, not before you even start. At least that is how I look at it.  I can't really say much about the story because I would just spoil it. Let's move on chacters. There are only two. The main protagonist, 'Junker' (yeah, we don't get to know his name) and Hoshino Yumemi. Junker is your solitary protagonist, minding his own bussines. Yumemi is the polar opposite. Robots in this world are programmed to serve and obey humans. She cares about our hero only because her software is telling her so. Oh, and she is very, but very talkative. Even though Yumemi is robot and is behaving like one, there is no way you won't think of her as a human for at least one time. And that is truly something. We are constantly reminded that she is indeed robot, both by her actions, dialog and by narrator. And yet, I could not help myself but think of her as a human. It was not her character sprite, it was the writing that has done so. And I did not even notice it. There was a perfect balance between reminding us that she is just a robot and making her feel so human. It was just incredibly well made. The sprite, the voice acting, the dialog, everything worked.  The chemistry bewtween these two is also quite noticible, especially near the end. I did not believe that all was Yumemi was doing for Junker was because her software told her so. I just didn't. And I think that was the point. I think it is amazing that they managed in less the 5 hours make robot feel more human then our main character and everybody else in the world.   And speaking or writing, you could just rip it out of this game, paste it on paper and nobody would really notice that this was at first VN. Unlike some other VNs at Steam, this is a huge achievemnt. That is not to say rest of it is completely unnecessary.   I can say like 10 words in Japanese so I have no right to judge the voice acting. Yes, this novel is fully voice acted, even MC got his own voice actor. But VA of Yumemi was just joy to listen to. Her voice felt robotic and human at the same time. Junker does not really talk much with the exception of the ending. But he gives of that 'lone wolf' vibe, if it makes sense. Nonetheless, they were both very entertaining.  The art in this game is great. Yumemi's design is just gorgeous, you can see for yourself in the pics above. The overall art really helps the atmosphere. However, one issue I have with the look of this game is its layout. I don't understand why they thought making the background one small imagine and putting it on the top of the screan and filling the rest with some random gears while putting the text into the box at the bottom was a good idea. It feels odd, especially since Yumemi covers the entire right part of the screen and it does not really add to anything in my opinion. Some images cover almost the entire screen too, that looked great, I don't know why they made almost the entire game like that. And another thing, the whole escape menu looks exactly the same as your choice options when you right click on your desktop. It looks bad and incredibly out of place.  Soundtrack for most part is quite nice. The whole soundtrack, as far as i know, is around 40 minutes long. That being said, it is the something I would want to listen to while doing something else. The one track that, however, stood out was Gentle Jena. My god, this song is the definition of beautiful. Go and listen to an extended version, you won't regret it.  There are in total 19 achievemnts, two of which you get for entering CG Mode and Music mode, which you unlock at the after you finish the game. You can finish it in less then 3 hours if you are fast reader and you are not using voice acting (which I don't recommend). Yes, it is very short. But I don't think that is a problem. Who said all good stories had to be super long? But that brings another issue- the price. 10€ for 3-5 hours long game is too much. Wait for it to be on sale.  TL;DR pros: +story, simple, yet beautiful +charcters +Yumemi's design +atmosphere +chemistry +art +its messege +feels included for all you masochists like me ^^  cons: -layout -lazy and ugly in-game menu -price  Final Verdict: 9/10  Just like every other game made by Key, this is also beautiful and simple tale with powerful message, nice art and good soundtrack to support it all. But despite its pros, it is not really worth 10€. Put it to your wish list and wait for sale, then buy it as fast as you can, you won't regret it.  I also recommend this game to everyone who is interested in VN but has yet to find a good place to start. Just like I said it is very short, so you won't really feel like you have wasted too much time if you end up disliking it.",

Regardless of what the feelings may be, it accomplishes what it sets out to do. This visual novel evokes emotions and it's even a little educational, in the aspect of astronomy. Like many other Key productions, the story sticks with you. The story takes you somewhere else during certain parts and the soundtrack is wonderful.

Short and masterfully done, it's easy to get wrapped in this little tale about a man and a robot.  The good: + short and easy to read. planetarian and Narcissu are probably the best place to grow accustomed with Visual Novels. + greatly detailed. Pretty much every scene is filled with details. The game suffers from a shortage of CGs, but your imagination (and the writing) will make up to it. + nice atmosphere. I don't care much about the war and the state of the current world, but planetarian gives you some nice insight without going astray from the main plot.  The bad: - soundtrack feels a bit tiresome after the first hour. Music turns me on, and 07th Expansion novels always did a great job with it. Might say that I was left a bit disappointed with Key's planetarian. Kinect Novels should always be filled with music, and planetarian does feature only a few of them. - feels a bit old. Old is not necessarily bad, but planetarian suffers from this feeling that you are touching a very old Visual Novel. Looks and feels a bit outdated,  but not bad . Some scenes and effects are still quite impressive. - lacking in the CG department. Lots of CG potential wasted here. The couple of CGs you get are not bad, though.   TL;DR? planetarian is a nice little visual novel. If that's going to be your first VN, you won't be disappointed. If you already read a lot of VNs before, you'll be missing a lot skipping this one. A must-play for veterans and newcomers. The asking price is low enough to be worth the two or three hours of gameplay.   Score: 8/10   Pardon me for any misspellings and incomprehensible sentences.

Yumemi is more than just a machine, but the way she's written, I didn't reach the point where it felt she was truly alive, either.

The story is about 4 hours long, give or take a little bit depending on your reading speed. I happened to leave it running by mistake.

Some may balk at the price of admission for such a short tale (My time shown is pretty much how long it'll take for one to finish the story) but I feel it is well worth it given how well crafted all the features are--It is also voiced too.

Times you're laughing, times you're angry, and, of course, times you're crying. I think that this would make a great introduction in to the world of Visual Novels (VNs), or another good read for those who play them regularly. Planetarian is of course a bit different from most VNs, as there is no branching paths in the story. We call ones like these Kinetic. In any case, I felt it was a bit expensive for only about five hours of reading. My advise would be to wait until it is on sale, or try a few free VNs, like Juniper's Knot by Dischan Media, another Knetic novel like this.   I'm gonna give this a 9/10. The only obsticle to really manage is that the only options you get are when you open it. If you want to change any settings, you have to right click.

The visuals and artwork are beautifully crafted down to every last detail, from the character art to the backgrounds, everything is perfectly defined, a masterpiece of modern Japanese anime art.  Sound is equally brilliant, from the voice acting down to the music, every word, every tone, every little tune is perfectly placed and fits equisitely with the mood throughout.  And of course, the main part of a visual novel, the story. What can I say about the story? Well...  Planterian, in short, is one of the most emotionally powerful things I've ever experienced in my life. I'm accustomed to visual novels and their abilities to create an emotional response, whether it's happiness, sadness, anger or any other range of emotions, but what I didn't expect from this was that it would have me crying so much that I felt like my eyeballs were going to explode because my tear ducts couldn't excrete tears fast enough to keep up with what was going on. It's a real heart-breaker of a story, and at the end you won't feel like you're just losing another character in another game, you'll feel like you're losing a much loved friend, it'll shatter your heart into a million pieces and scatter them across the night sky like the twinkling stars of Yumemi's planetarium. It's worth more than the price it's selling for on Steam, and I recommend that anyone, whether you like visual novels or not, should sit down with this, switch it on auto, get a box of tissues, and prepare to witness something that will stay in your heart and your memories forever. x",

It's worth noting that it's a kinect novel, so there are no choices to be had and it is basically just a voiced story with images. Considering the short length however, this isn't really a draw back. It felt like no moments of the game were wasted filler, unlike most longer vns I've played, but it also didn't feel like things progressed too quickly. Basically, it has really good pacing that makes for an engrossing single sit read.

The game tells a great story set in a a world which is essentially dead, It will develop a unique meeting of a person who happened upon a robot in the planetarian, the story will take you through their meeting and the robots love for stars, to explain how the world is how it is and how she became to be alone, forever waiting the return of the staff and customers. The story telling is really top notch, for only two real characters, you never feel your missing anything, they have great interactions and her becomes to enjoy the robot being around. Of course this is Key, anyone who knows key probably knows it will be sad, so i wont touch to heavy there as i don't want to ruin it, just expect to feel sad with the end developments.   All in all, the game is amazing, it's a short 4 hour average play (might be a little less if you are quick reading and skip some voice, a litte longer on auto play) but it's worth every second with amazing story telling and emotional impact 10/10 easy",

The artwork was good, and helped to tell the story, especially when combined with the sound effects.  The story is beautiful, and very poignant. WIthout revealing too much, it's a nice discussion about the ambitions and flaws of humanity. There is a very fitting score for the game, which fits the mood of the various settings, and really helps tell the story.  Being a Visual Novel, there isn't anything to say regarding gameplay or controls - you just click your way through. The interface is easy enough to navigate and saving your game is easy. I played this with the steam controller - as it meant I could sit in bed and play. Anything you use to click your way through is fine.  The VN does an excellent job of giving backstory, and building up characters and their relationships.. It's also very effective at setting a tone of isolation. I absolutely enjoyed this VN and it pressed all the right buttons for me. After I finished the story last night, I felt very quiet and reflective. Emotions abound.  Simply superb.",

Still need to play that as of writing, but coming into the game, I trusted that it was going to be good. I was not at all let down. While I didn't cry, the mood that this kinetic novel, a game where there aren't any choices, had set was pretty obvious.  Our protagonist starts off finding our female lead, Yumemi, as annoying, as she's quite the chatterbox. But after spending time with her, he gets used to her antics. And my god, I found her so adorable. Really reminds me of Koboshi from Let's Meow Meow, so now that I know of Yumemi's existence, I now have two robots who are easily best girls.  I'm only 2 hours in, and haven't yet gotten through all of the chapters, but I have confidence the rest of the game will be good. As someone new to Ren'py, I really like the writing style. Haven't played other visual novels, it's interesting to note the way how a VN describes things. Steins;Gate and Corpse Party are perspective heavy, Nekopara (Volume 0 anyway) is dialogue heavy, while planetarian leans more towards description, although of course has dialogue as well.  I don't really have anything else to comment about the game, other than addressing one of the reviews negatively posted, where the reviewer obviously expected this game to have endings to get. Lol. Sorry to say that's not what kinetic novels are. One's like these are more like reading an anime/manga than anything else, which is not a bad thing.",
