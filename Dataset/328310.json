Got it on sale and installed it three times cause of a bug which did not let me play the second day. I gave up! For three times playing the first workday and getting stuck at the second workday in which the game does not see the objectives as finished even though they are clearly finished.   The game has a very slow game play. And the simulation is far from realistic. The bad graphics I could live with but since the game has so many bugs as if it's an unfinished game that collected dust but the developers decided to publish it, I can not recommend this game to anyone.  If you like sim games, find some other game. Do not waste your money or time on this one!",
