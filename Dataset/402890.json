            "review_text": "Man, I'm tired... so tired... So so tired of low-rez walking sims full of pretentious emo BS. Slow paced, pretending to be deep, or 'psychological'... full of fake 'mystery'... You know what's REALLY getting old? bloody walls full of eyeballs, especially when they LITERALLY MEAN NOTHING.  So, you think this game looks interesting? Might be worth your time? Hey, it's free right? Let me save you 90 minutes of your life.  This is a game about a breakup.  Not that you'll figure that OUT until the very last minute of the game. And I do mean minute.  This is one of those games that tells you absolutely nothing about what's going on until you click on something, then it dumps a bunch of text on you that ALSO means nothing. It will string you along with 'mystery' that doesn't actually lead anywhere. Literally. You enter a mysterious catacomb that literally goes nowhere. Your character acts like he's living in a house he's never been in before when it turns out it was the HOUSE HE GREW UP IN ALL ALONG!!11 There's a mysterious tall man that keeps reappearing and spouting surreal garbage that literally means nothing and then he literally goes WELL IT WAS FUN I WON'T BE SEEING YOU and disappears from the story from there on. and then it turns out you were a whiny emo guy the WHOLE TIME  If I could have set my own pace I would have finished this game in about 16 minutes, barring the unnavigable 'maze' and the obnoxious addition puzzle. instead I was bogged down by a slow walking speed and fixed text crawl which made one word sentences linger on my screen for a quarter of a minute each.  I'm not going to bother looking at the other ending. Presumably it has something to do with the character's relationship with his dad, which is another thing.  Dear 'indie dev' hipsters, we really don't care about your ex-girlfriends and your daddy issues. Make a game about a murder mystery! Make a game about a power plant accident! Make a game where you can freakin run and jump and shoot monsters, and isn't IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE ATOM BOMB or whatever. Also WE ARE SICK OF YOUR CRAPPY POETRY, we wouldn't want to read it in a book, why would we want to play a game with it?  As a person who actually HAS gone through a breakup which sent me into a severe depression, I couldn't relate to this story about a guy who went through a breakup which sent him into a severe depression. I was just annoyed by it. Annoyed by it and a thousand other boring stupid games exactly like it.",

            "review_text": "Nyctophilia. A very specific condition where a person enjoys seeing Topher Grace smothered in nectar.... which makes no sense at all, which is also how I would sum up this game.   It's the very vague type of storytelling that makes the gamer hope for a shocking revelation to make the time worthwhile. But that doesn't happen. The graphic are 8 bit. That's fine. The music is simple, cheap and moody. That's fine too. There is a mind boggling catacomb to wade through and another lever puzzle that's somewhat interesting. But is this not a story game to begin with? Either I didn't pay enough attention or the story just didn't go anywhere.   In the end, what Nyctophilia is probably trying to say is, 'Why are you still awake deep into the night. Go to bed!'",

The english is suprisingly terrible, but that'd only be a major complaint if the game was trying to be serious... Oh, I think it was. Woops. It made me laugh more often than not. Anyway, gameplay wise, the story didn't hook me within the first 20 minutes, the gameplay is slow, and there's no real puzzles in a game genre focused on puzzles and interesting stories. The graphics are bland and uninspired, and the music is average at best. Overall I'd give this game a very poor rating.",

The maze is pretty much impossible to figure out and it you do it's by pure luck. There are not enough people out there who have played it for there to be a tutorial that works, and I've just wasted an hour trying to figure it out with no luck. Plus, looking for a tutorial with the word 'Nyctophilia' is not recommended. YOU JUST FIND PORN. I liked the gameplay, and I would defintely play it again if the catacomb had a tutorial or a map that worked, but right now it's just too difficult for me. If you have time and like that sort of thing, you'd enjoy it.",
