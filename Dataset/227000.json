Many of the most thought-provoking events make references to issues that have kept me awake before. It's interesting to experience a game that has me thinking about it for a time after the ending credits.  There are some audio issues after using Steam's overlay UI, but the game's pretty polished aside from that glitch. The puzzles are good, but the world is a little empty. However, the animated characters are entertaining and keep things interesting. The artwork and voiceover work is also amazing.  If you want a good story that's told with a classic style point-and-click adventure game, then this is it.",

So I gave it a try, and was blown away by how much I absolutely enjoyed it. It's your standard point-and-click; you collect items, open your inventory, and can combine items or use them on characters or objects in the world to progress. So there's little to mess up when it comes to controls, and Primordia succeeds there.  The game is set some ambiguous number of years in the future. The world is inhabited by robots, no sign of organic life anywhere. You play as Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot designed to build and repair. While aboard your ship, the Uniic, you are attacked by a strange robot and stripped of your ship's power core. Left without transportation and limited power keeping you running, you are left with no other option but to wander out into the world, trying to track down a power source, or as a last resort, enter the city of Metropol, 'the city of glass and light.' Not much is known about Metropol, other than there is supposedly unlimited power for everyone. Still, Horatio has his reserves about entering the city; despite his logic-driven robot nature, he doesn't trust the place. As I mentioned, the art style was much of what first intrigued me, and it's prevalent throughout the game. It's designed to look very old-school and pixelated, but the amount of detail that can be projected by so few pixels is astounding, not to mention the general apocalyptic dystopian feel it gives off, which as a fan of Fallout, I enjoyed all too much.  Overall this was one of those games that gave me that feel of reading a really good book; I'd sit down and play and not want to put it down until I found out what happened next. The only problems I had were a few vague or confusing puzzles, in which I had to resort to the old 'try everything with everything on everything' play method common to point-and-click games. Aside from that, the game offers multiple endings, some far more underwhelming than others, which left me feeling a tad unsatisfied. Still, the game was extremely enjoyable, and one of the few games that I'd almost like to forget playing so I could enjoy it all over again.",

            "review_text": "This game has an excellent story and a unique and interesting setting filled with charmingly colorful characters. It is thoughtful and meaningful, and addresses some serious theological and philosophical points, while remaining mysterious and exciting (most of the time). However, I found the gameplay to be very lacking, in a number of ways. I'm now going to complain about all the things I need to complain about, but do please recall that I actually enjoyed this game :)  The puzzles in this game were difficult, and not in a good way. While many of them had 'cool' solutions - which would be awesome in a movie, for example - they were often not cleanly solvable, in the sense that they were the only plausible solution and made everything 'make sense' when you figured it out. For me, a lot of the reason I want to play a puzzle game is for that awesome feeling of everything coming together when I figure it out. This is not the sort of game that does that for me. Here's a few of the problems that I saw:  1. Trying to create a clever solution rather than a good puzzle. The solutions to puzzles are often the sort of zany solutions that are fun to watch heroes think of in movies, but not reasonable to force the player to think of. In other words, they don't feel like THE solution, just A solution (and yet in the confines of the game, they are THE solution). 2. Tooooo many items. Unlike a lot of games, in Primordia you almost never get an item taken out of your inventory when you are done using it. By the end of the game, I have so much stuff in my inventory that the task of getting through a locked door has dozens of reasonable-sounding solutions - crowbar, plasma torch, signal transmitter to pick the lock, etc, etc - but only one of them is right (and it's probably none of the standard things I've learned how to do throughout the game, because that would be to easy). 3. Generic, reusable items. This is one of my pet peeves in puzzle games. When you have a generic item like a hammer, there's a trillion and five ways that the player can think of to use this item. Even if the game designer could think of all of those, allowing those solutions would make many of their puzzles too easy. Anyway, this game is full of generic items that you use again and again throughout the game (but are never allowed to use when you think of it). 4. Confusing items. I had a whole bunch of electronic gadgets and doodads that it took me a long time to figure out how they worked - a signal transmitter, a decryption device, a memory reader, etc. All of these could be used only in very specific circumstances (i.e. as far as I can tell, the memory reader can only be used to access memories from a severed robot head - which you encounter in this game a lot more than you would think!), but this information is never explicitly told to you (I never really figured out what the rules for the decryption device were). 5. Just too much going on at once. The game is basically divided into two parts. During each part, you slowly unlock more areas, and then can travel freely between all areas that you have unlocked during that part, which by the end of each part results in a huge environment in which to look for a small number of remains tasks.  The end result of all of this was that I played the game with a walkthrough constantly ready. And I do not regret it :) Most of the things I had to get help on ('most' because I started getting lazy near the end), I think I would have felt frustrated rather than satisfied if I took the time to solve myself.  The interface is unfathomably archaic and unintuitive. For example, the process of using an item - one of the most base necessities of a point and click game - requires (1) hovering near the top of the screen to open the tool bar, (2) selecting the inventory button to open your inventory, (3) selecting the item from the inventory, (4) clicking outside the inventory to close it, then finally (5) clicking on the thing in the world that you want to use the item on. On all the interfaces mentioned, there are also many confusing and sometimes unnecessary/duplicate buttons. The datachron (which automatically takes notes on things you have learned) has a horrific interface that looks something like an old school gameboy, with giant text on a tiny screen, and buttons (that you have to click with your mouse) for scolling up and down. Similarly, the signal transmitter - on which you frequently need to set a 4-digit number to transmit - is pretty obnoxious, requiring you to click on the left and right sides of two dials (not even buttons that you can see, so it's hard to find the sweet spot to actually click on) - one to cycle through numbers, and one to cycle through DIGITS. DIGITS.  All that being said, however, I think this game is definitely worth playing for the story alone, which like I said is fantastic.",

Even though the characters in the game are robots they retain many human properties that makes them quite relatable. To add to this, their human traits are merged with some very interesting quirks based on what purposes they were coded for. This makes almost every character you meet really interesting and memorable, and also drives a lot humor in the game. In particular, the bond between the playable character Horatio and his creation and best friend Crispin is consistently entertaining thoughtout the whole game. It's not just the setting that's great though, the writing and story in general is fantastic, and the voice acting is amazing.  The gameplay draws really well from the setting too. Scavenging for spare parts and pieceing machines together might feel pretty familiar to anyone who has played an adventure game before, but because of the setting and design of the game all of this feels really organic and fluid. It helps that there are core items in the game aren't simply used once and then thrown away, but instead you are gathering an array of tools (Your friend Crispin being one of them!) that you will keep reusing throughout the whole game. There is still the odd puzzle that had solutions I wouldn't have thought of and got me turning to a guide, but I would put this down to my own impatience rather than design faults of the game. I never really took the time to think things out completely as I was too compelled to move forward with the story!  Long story short, I would strongly recommend this game. The only negative thing I can think of is that I had a couple of very minor technical issues that were resolved easily. If you have any interest in point-and-click adventures or story-driven games in general I wouldn't hesitate to pick this one up.",

Horatio and his companion Crispin leave their home and head for the city of glass and light - Metropol. Here, you will uncover secrets of your past and gain a better understanding of humans who previously walked there.  Primordia does not reinvent the genre, it is a sci fi adventure game that offers a dark and meaningful story - something lost in some modern point and click games. The game provides excellent atmosphere, a rich script, solid puzzles and an art style that is really captivating. It is the sort of game that tries to restore the classic point and click genre and I believe it has truly nailed it. It feels like the 90's, but shows that with careful animations, voice acting and intricate details, that 'modern' resolutions and graphics are not always necessary.  I wanted to find out more and had to see the different endings, take different paths and look for more information online. The only fault would be that it is perhaps too short, especially if you are used to classic adventure games. Some puzzles were pretty difficult and there were a few moments of 'That doesn't make much sense', though that's something I always expect from these games.  It is not really going to interest people who don't play point and click games. It is for people who miss games like The Dig, Beneath a Steel Sky and maybe even the classic Fallout games (in terms of atmosphere). It has replay value, great soundtrack, top storytelling and is certainly difficult enough to stump you in a few places. Highly recommended.",

Primordia is heavily story rich. There's so much in the world that I wish I could have explored more so that I might have more knowlege about it, but since it's not importaint to the plot it's touched on at most.    There is an information kiosk that you can look at however. It'll give you information on any topic you can find.     You follow Horatio and Crispin, two robots living out in the dunes, until their power core was stolen by a bigger robot. They embark on a mission to get it back. I don't want to go too deep into story but the ending was one I was very satisfied with. I'm so used to games having a truely happy ending but the endings in Primordia were none of that.    The endings were that of weariness, telling the player that in this world there is no such thing as a happy ending. The world has died and there doesn't seem to be a way to get a kind of renewable resource, and if there is it's just not known.     Primordia was an amazing game, it wasn't too long nor too short.

            "review_text": "When I first saw this game, I was looking for something similar to machinarium (another point-and-click adventure game) and what I was met with while playing Primordia was not at all disappointing. There are some very unique things that set this game apart from other point-and-click adventure games.  One element that is so different about Primordia is the surprisingly large amount of dialogue that is incorporated into it, unlike most other games of the genre.  Another characteristic that adds to the game is Crispin, the protagonist's 'sidekick' if you would call him that. He adds a sense of humour to the game (although sometimes rather corny) and can offer hints to the player that are valuable, but not always completely revealing of the next course of action that must be taken. Crispin is an often uplifting character in this post-apocalytic setting.  Another trait that won me over is the atmosphere in the game. It seems realistic in the post-apocalyptic setting, and it is one of my favorite things about this game. The backrounds always seem beautifully made.  The puzzles in this game are very engaging and are not always clear-cut which may seem like a bad thing, but I personally enjoy the extra challenge. Not every puzzle is as simple as clicking on one thing and then another. They often include various items and/or certain actions to be taken. This is a huge difference between Primordia and other point-and-click adventure games.  The only complaint I really have about this game is that it seems to include a few creationist concepts that I personally do not agree with. It is brought up through the concept of humanism in the game which is symbolic of today's major religions that believe that a god created humans.  Another piece of this game that I am not fully content with is the way the protagonist moves. It can sometimes seem somewhat clumsy, but I won't be critical about it seeing as how that is how it is with most other point-and-click adventure games.  Overall, I would give this game an 8.5/10. It is definitely a worthwhile play for those who like games such as machinarium or other big point-and-click adventure games because of the unique elements it includes.  One last thing I would like to address is that it sometimes has multiple choices that can be made, leading to different outcomes. They do not alwyas have a huge effect on the story, but it adds a sense of independence in the game. I highly recommend that you all look into playing this game :) ",

I could tell just from looking at the trailer and screenshots of this game that it looked interesting, and that 'Overwhelmingly Positive' next to the user reviews made it seem like a no-brainer. So, finally I picked up this game and boy, I am not disappointed.  Let's get the bad out of the way first.  This game runs in a very small resolution, at least for most modern monitors. The highest resolution possible is 1280x800, which looks best in a window. It was also a bit annoying that the only way I could find to change these settings was by a launcher in the actual folder containing the game files. I only found that much by perusing the game forum when I was disappointed with the resolution.  There isn't much replayability. I can definitely see myself trying this game again to do a few things different, but overall it is a story-driven and therefore linear experience. It has several endings, but most of those endings are decided at your own whim by how you play out the final scenes.  Now, the good.  The obvious first thing you'll notice about this game is that artwork. I found it to be very cool to look at and definitely gives you that feeling of despair - a world wasting away around you as you desperately try to rebuild what you can. You also have atmospheric music that adds to these scenes but mostly stays in the background. It adds a lot, but doesn't overtake it. Instead, it's all just working together to give you an experience.  The voice acting is likewise excellent. The main character and his sidekick both do most of the talking, so it's great to see them so well performed. It's easy to pick up on their personalities and they're both likeable.  I'm always a bit bad at puzzles in games, but I thought the ones here were challenging but always possible. Nothing ever felt frustrating or beyond my abilities to figure out. I did get 'stuck' in a few places where I had no idea what to do, but it usually came down to me not thinking about the situation well enough or remembering details that I simply overlooked. It's worth saying, almost everything matters in this game. There are few things that are superfluous.  Overall it took me about six hours to complete this game. I would have liked for it to be longer, but I could say that for any good game.  If you're interested in this game at all, check it out.",

Let's just say that I expected some pretty grand moments that the game never even came close to delivering. But I would still recommend this game, as parts of the story are pretty interesting and some of the puzzles and conversations are cool.  I do have to talk about Crispin though. It feels like they tried to make a Wheatley-esque character who follows you everywhere, and is kind of annoying but also endearing and adorable. Unfortunately they made Crispin too much of a smartass, so he comes off as not very endearing, not even remotely adorable, but still quite annoying. His lines also get very tiresome, as they are often just lame puns and jokes, and he doesn't have a very large number of them. And aside from scripted scenes, his comedic presence didn't change in response to the increasingly minatory plot, which often ruined the tone.  Lastly, the voice-acting generally isn't very good. The villain probably has the best voice-acting. The voices themselves? Very good, well-chosen, well-suited to their characters. But the acting itself wasn't very good. It's fairly boring and I got tired of listening to everyone speak pretty quickly. Perhaps this was intentional because they were robots, but you can make someone sound robotic without sacrificing solid, emotive acting (case in point:  Portal ).",

A flying metal burrito with a laser pointer takes Horatio’s power core and he ain’t gonna take no ♥♥♥♥ from some ♥♥♥♥ – so he follows the trail of metal burrito to the last thriving city, a city of robots, ran by a hivemind that doesn’t take ♥♥♥♥ from no one. I had taken 6 hours to play through it; however it’s because I’m a ♥♥♥♥♥ and used a walkthrough. Going through without a guide would provide several more hours than what I have listed.

            "review_text": "Certainly one of the best point and click Adventures I've played since the nineties!* Both immersive and humerous. The story is Great and told extremely well. the art style is very appealing combining art nouveau and cyberpunk proves a valid design concept, the resolution ould be a tad bit higher tho and animations are a bit of a let down but that's a flaw of many games in the genre. Gameplay is fluid, controlls and leveldesign are sensible, avoiding frustration. Riddles range from realtively easy tasks to complex and hard enigmas, without lowering to the level of odd/alien/generic minigames or resulting in daylong meditations on what to do. Unlike most P&amp;Cs with inventory, Primordias items are neither randomly taken from the environment(aka taking the banana instead of the wench) nor require absurd combinations, most 'crating' tasks are sensible.  The Help function is a bit wonky, it's hints range from being very specific to being nomore than a slight nudge in the right direction and there are no 'advice levels' or 'search functions'. there is no hotspot highlighter, which may be seen both ways. You will have to think a bit to get this game done but it's very well solvable without any outside help** or random clicking. It's also fully*** voiced, and quite good if I may add.  Ps: Unniic, Genius!  *Probably THE best if you dismiss myst 4 as not a point and click game **I required it once, when I was standing infront of the hotspot. The hotspot was even named 'crystal' -.- ***The is one spot(info booth) where I would have liked an additional voiceover, something Myst 4 did: voice all written text. ",

Feels like a spiritual successor of sorts to Beneath A Steel Sky, something I'm surprised more people didn't pick up on. Visually it all works and the music pleasantly chugs along - Along with some humour from Horatio and Crispin.  Here's the problem though; Just as the game allows you to get more comfortable and eager to explore the story more, it stops becoming fun. The middle section of the game has some painful 'swap this for that' puzzle sequences that become a chore, and you are only driven to continue because of the story, and trust me, you will be looking at a walkthrough at some point, some of the puzzles are too obtuse.  It also ends far too soon - overall only having 2 main environments in the whole game is not that satisfying at all, and what could have been quite atmospheric starts to feel a little brownwashed. The character development was never built up long enough for me to feel any emotional connections with the characters, and there were some uninspired and cliched plot turns. Beneath A Steel Sky never varied too much in environment either but at least it stayed enjoyable right to the end. There are multiple paths in the game to take which will lead to different endings - but it really depends on whether you enjoyed the first run to want to do this, and I'm not entirely sure if I want to play this game again for a while. Shame there's no windowed mode either, can appreciate the Lucasarts style resolution/graphics decision but couldn't easily leave the window or tweak anything.  I'm not saying it's a bad game, trust me, it isn't - I would just suggest you wait for it to go on sale, as there's a chance you could be disappointed like I was.",

It has the best sense of humour of just about any game I have played. The story is good, though some of the elements don't fit together.  The problems are:   1/ the graphics are terrible. Yes, they have a cute, arty style but they are ridiculously low resolution.   2/ The mechanics are clunky, with slow menus and too much time watching pixellated figures crossing the screen painfully slowly.   3/ Some of the puzzles are good, but a lot of the time I had to use a walkthrough not because a puzzle was difficult but because the game is inconsistent. Most exits are identified by mousing over, but some are only identified if you move the character to the edge of the screen. There is a system of storing info useful for solving puzzles but some of the info stored is irrelevant and some vital info is not stored. To combine items in inventory you pick up A and mouse it over B. You get a message telling you that's a dumb idea, but it turns out you need to pick up B and mouse it over A.",
