            "review_text": "First impression: a fun simple dungeon crawler.  I have to admit, at first I was not going to recommend this game. Who recommends a RPG that controls almost entirely with the mouse? With the left mouse button only? You put the pointer where you want to go and click your mouse, you select a skill/spell with a number key (1-5) and click your mouse (and if it was on cooldown, you go there), and while the skill is casting, you can't move and if you move your mouse the skill fires elsewhere and who does an isomertric RPG without WASD movement? I wanted WASD movement and mouse aim, and I didn't get it, and as a result, running and then aiming is difficult, and you need to run because if you play as a wizard (which I did) you're squishy, and you have no friends unless you can summon them in tier 3, and they don't help much.  But the thing that turns out to be fun is aggroing a bunch of foes, putting a 15 second field of fire down and running circles around it much like a sheep-dog, except that a sheepdog wouldn't keep the sheep in the fire. Various portal- and non-portal-related puzzles integrated into the levels, new spells/skills as i level up, it's not getting boring. Sure, it's not Skyrim; there's no epic storyline, no quests, it's not even Torchlight with its fishing and crafting and whatnot -- this is meant to be a fun little RPG game that, while small and easy to get into, doesn't feel dumbed down. Heck, even the inventory is big enough, and the spell that gets you back to camp is practically free.  What I'm saying is, when a planned half hour to get a first impression turns into 4+ hours of fun, this game is doing something right.  Still, it's a first impression; I have no idea how melee and archery play; haven't tried multiplayer; haven't beaten any of the big bosses and not breached the procedurally generated dungeons. But what I've seen, I like.",

Hours of addicting game play, no real grinding(that I've experienced so far), and for how simple it is it really is in depth. If you like simple RPGs, you'll love it.",

            "review_text": "Being exiled is not as fun as one might think, first and foremost, it's lonely. Secondly, you get attacked by beasts, every minute of every day. But if you work hard and learn skills, you can fight these creatures, and turn the tide of battle. Want to be a real man? Well look no further, because in this title not only are you exiled, you're also exiliumed.",

            "review_text": "In Exilium is a short but fun isometric action RPG in the same vain as Diablo, but with a minimalistic aesthetic that is somewhat unique. It has an above average soundtrack, some fun puzzles, (I'm not a puzzle fan, so my use of the word 'fun' preceding the word 'puzzles' holds some gravity) and interesting monsters to fight. Depending on how you invest your stat points when you level up, you can be a warrior, wizard, or ranger.   Like I said, this game is short. There isn't a huge variety in weapons/armor or loot, and what little story there is seems to be subject to player interpretation. After completing the campaign, I am pretty sure, although not certain, that the story takes place internally, within the mind and/or spirit of the main character. Anyway, if you're looking for a fun but short, casual action rpg, look no further.",

Not so good:    Boring, slow &amp; repetetive fighting( Warrior )    One of the most tedious locations i have experienced to date ( Infernus)    Weak story   Interesting and at times fun game, but has it's flaws. Didn't regret playing it but neither can i recommend it to anyone else. 5 out of 10, decent rpg but with heavy flaws.",
