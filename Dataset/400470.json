            "review_text": "With latest version bringing yet another long list of improvements, the game has progressed immensively since the release. It's also worth noting, that most of the gameplay issues mentioned in the negative reviews, are long gone. I recommend reading through the update log and forums to see how well Oliver Keppelmüller has improved the game and listened to the players of the game. The in-game tooltips and given information has also improved a lot, with the manual explaining most of the game mechanics. What still may remain an issue may be stability. But that too is a lot less common than before.   The game may not be the most beautiful out there, but the blend of real time strategic campaign, including quite a sophisticated economy model with a Settlers/Railroad Tycoon type of production chains, and real time tactical battles with huge amount of troops and good combination of realism and playability, it is a thoughtful strategy game that brings to mind many of the 1990s classics.   In short, this game may look a bit like a Total War game (Empire or Napoleon), but it goes deeper and requires more thinking from the player, being less of action oriented: something that I really like. It's unbelieveable that it's the work of a single man, who actually has a day job as well!",

Besides this if you love history and this great timeline i reccomend you to get this game,you won't regret it.",
