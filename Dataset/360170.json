And the more you level up how harder it gets. But it's fun to start off slowly so you exactly know how everything works so you are prepared. And this crafting system is 10/10! To play this with a friend online is also much fun. I really can't get enough of it. I never played zombie/survival games before but I got introduced to this game and I love it! 10/10",

We have our base. And can pretty much do whatever we want independently of one another and team up as and when we want to. The main map is large and we go on roams around that - and we initiate missions for resources we want that are plentiful on those instances - and sometime team up - sometimes not - one of us might be messing around with the base one might be in an instance - someone else might be on a roam. Just loads of fun. I also play solo with added meaning - because I can dump resources into our team base - effectively farming for when we team up again.",

            "review_text": "I never got around to play much of the first installment for various reasons and my review will be positive when taking the price into consideration, it´s definately not an overly expensive survival game and there is a lot of stuff to do.  You play a character who either in melee or ranged kills litteraly thousands of Zombies in order to accomplish the various missions given by NPCs, these tasks give you XP to improve your camp and skills. This is all done from an asymmetric perspective (top down view) and unlike the first game you actually get to build a camp with various buildings.  The armory f.ex. gives you the option to manufacture weapons and can be upgraded as you level your camp. I havn´t had to grind much outside of the missions until lvl 10 which to me is a plus, however the missions themselves tend to be a bit tedious and overly repetitive, maybe its actually what is to be expected ... this is a survival game where killing zombies is your thing. I guess grinding and overly repetitive chores belong to most survival games now a days.  Perhaps due to lack of skill on my part the game favors ranged combat a lot, it´s simply too easy to get hit in melee while ranged combat is for the most part the safest and actually easiest bet. There are things that can kill you very fast and I like to stay alive for as long as possible, some sort of shield would have been nice to help with melee.  Again, given the price its a thumbs up, I already recorded 16 hours of gameplay and in no way do I feel let down, my best advice for you is to watch some game play on youtube and get a feeling for wether you will enjoy the game.",

            "review_text": "If you're looking for a comparison to How to Survive 1, look elsewhere. Now that that's out of the way, How to Survive 2 is very much a 'one step forward, one step back' kind of game. There are some things it does very well, punctuated by regular bouts of puzzling laziness in terms of development.  Environments are pretty detailed, but they are also repetitive. Technically, rotating existing buildings to keep things visually interesting was a good tactic to save development time, but it's overused.  Sound design - what sound design? As far as I could tell there are two songs in the game - the intro screen, and whenever you pull too many zombies. I'm pretty sure I even detect the same public-domain zombie noise that Minecraft uses.   The game's content is doled out at a shuffling zombie's pace. It consists of building your camp up on a large 'camp map', and instanced quests with their own maps. It isn't the sprawling free-roam map I was hoping for. At ten, then five-level intervals you're required to survive a zombie siege (which you trigger) in order to raise the camp and its buildings higher, thus getting new gear and new quests.  There is technically no over-arching plot, just 'do stuff, build up the camp.' Most quests are just there to get materials. Others double-back in the sense that you do a quest for Character A, then one for Character B to sabotage A, then another quest for Character A to fix the results of your own sabotage. This kind of backpedaling destroys any sense of progress, assuming you were meant to feel any such thing to begin with. At least some of the characters are obviously from the first game (which I never played), with only brief glimpses to illustrate their relationships to each other. In particular, one character is made out to be the antagonist (?), but you never hear about him doing anything nefarious. If he's supposed to be the bad guy, the game utterly fails at demonstrating this, even moreso if it's based off his reputation or actions in the previous game. So, half the game's quests are directed at subverting this not-really-a-bad guy, and then sometimes fixing those subversions.  The UI, well.. Functions. Being able to sort equipment by level would have been nice, because looking for menu items that shifted place depending on whether or not you can craft them will eat up most of your time.  Sometimes the crafting system is a little borked. Some recipes need basic components that you can't make until quite a bit later than the recipes that need them. Some things are baffingly gated - you can make a homemade assault rifle in the first ten levels, but need to wait until your late 40's to make a throwing spear. Apart from this, the game typically gives you new recipes within a level or two, but sometimes the crafting chain unexpectedly ends. The level cap for the character/camp/buildings is 51, through ALL of which the Armory unlocks new recipes, but the Chemistry lab's recipe list ends around level 20. Because new recipes aren't guaranteed EVERY building level, you wind up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ away resources on at least a few levels of a building that's been tapped out.  Models look good - what few there are. Character customization options are limited, and each weapon type has ONE model. Every assault rifle will look like every other assault rifle. Don't get me wrong, these are really nice models, and it's not as though you spend an inordinate amount of time zoomed in, but --- really?  Other things are just absent altogether. 2016 is my 20th anniversary playing horror games, and this is the first zombie game I've played WITH NO SHOTGUN. Not even a blunderbuss you could cram bits of lead into. What the hell?  The camp has its own buildings and traps you can place, but several of the game's quirks prevent this from being a truly engaging experience. For one thing, there exist zero ways to completely block off all paths of entry into your camp while still being able to get in yourself. Gates, for some weird ♥♥♥♥ing reason, don't exist in the post-apocalypse. The only thing you can do is stick a low-fence in the perimeter somewhere, which the zombies can still climb over, and traps in front of it to hopefully kill them before they do.  There are only three damaging traps in the game. For whatever reason, the game has serious problems with inclines. Got a narrow ramp up to a plateau with plenty of horizontal clearance that you wanna stick Rotating Arms on? Too ♥♥♥♥in' bad. Want to place a ground-spike trap in the same area? Maybe. Or maybe just a low fence. Or maybe nothing at all, even though there is plenty of room for such things. Being unable to clear away trees for more space makes it worse. That's even assuming the zombies' pathing makes sense, which it usually doesn't. Sometimes they try to go through the fences, taking the most difficult way towards you as possible, and sometimes they take the path of least resistance - which if you've ever intelligently designed a base in other defense games, probably has most of the traps. Zombies occasionally spawn inside the fence-line if it's far enough away from actual buildings, and sometimes they proceed along the expected geographical routes into the base. Normally I'd applaud this mild unpredictability, but add to the fact that the game is essentially a cakewalk, it also means that avid base-builders are going to find the siege mechanic severely lacking.  Camp level slowly unlocks new zombie types, but the only challenge to be had is if you purposely increase the level of a mission above that of your character. It's largely the same zombies, only they eat more ammo to put down, and maybe there are a few more on the map. Zombie types are particularly uninspired and are purely ripped from other games/instances of zombie lore. At no time did I ever feel like I was in danger, unless I purposely 'went loud' with my weaponry.  Ammo isn't scarce, either. I played up until level 25 with a bow/crossbow (which thankfully has recoverable ammo) and an assault rifle for crowd control. By the time level 25 rolled around, I took stock of materials and discovered I could make a whopping 9600 lead rounds. The game REALLY wants you to go loud, because frankly that's where the fun is.  For multiplayer, your camp and character are saved separately. Your camp is also persistent, meaning other people can access it even when you're not online, and there's a private box for items. You set permissions on an individual basis, and people can join any mission in progress from anywhere else. I've only played with a couple friends, but the system seems solid.   The grinding in the game isn't too bad. The game will remember where you got the most of any item in case you need more later. This is ingenious and the devs deserve praise for such a system. Outside of that, there are very few items in the game I had to grind for, so even though the actual progression through the game is fairly slow, you won't spend countless hours grinding for most things. However, if you like to bash your way through the objectives and leave the rest of the loot, you're going to be repeating missions a lot more, and possibly be missing some items entirely. This will lead you to the online wiki, which is complete garbage, or the Steam forums, half of which seems to be in other languages.  So, why do I recommend this game after ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over it? It's unlike any zombie game I've ever played, and even if the game is purposely padded, slow, and could have been so much more, I estimate I got at least 80 hours out of it, which is astronomical for the price tag.",

You get to have your own screen on co-op mode, build a camp you have to defend and you get a good mix of environments and places to visit.   I love the idea of zombified animals and you get a good variety here. Using traps never gets old and at least at the moment, the game feels relatively more grounded on reality than the previous one. The weapons are nothing mythical like the overpowered boomerang on the previous game.   I think they did a great job at providing good transparency effects for trees and building to maintain visibility on your character most of the time. This is something Congo should take notes on.   The constant increase in difficulty as you level things up keeps you on your toes and encourages you to use the buddy system especially at night while you're away from your camp.  You also get to have a pet follow you around. At the moment I've only seen a crow but would be very stoked to get a dog if there is one in the game.  Overall it is a great time-waster. I tend to primarily look for positives in games I like and tend to make lemonade with any negatives. Maybe the only thing I would like to see more of is additional costumization options or characters.",

This isn't going to be a comprehensive review, that will come later, but I just want to say I love this game.   I will update this as I progress in the new playthrough on the Pros and Cons.  Edit #1:  I am now a level 10, with a level 10 camp. The game gets progressively difficult as you level up, the enemies get more health, and more and more runners appear. The gear you get gets progressivly better as well, so if you want it easy you can grind out gear and always be able to one shot the regular zoms if you wish, but you can also just go with it and it will get more and more challenging.  The crafting is even better than before.  When you play a level, you can play between up to 10 levels of difficulty based on your level and the level of the mission. If you are a level 10 trying to play a mission you can play it at any level from 5 to 15. However, you CANNOT play the mission below the default difficulty, and you CANNOT play it lower than 5 levels below your character's level.",

            "review_text": "Easily the worst game Ive ever purchased. The whole game consists of mashing the x button for hours (assuming you are using a controller). Theres only 2 enemy types. Regular zombie (90%) and fat zombie that one shots you with a suicide blast (10%). Theres zero reason to craft since theres an underground bunker thats fully furnished under the map and you can warp to it from multiple points at any time. Missions are fetch quests for simple items on a small enclosed area, and once you find the items, yep you guessed it, you warp back to the bunker. To top it off I purchased the $2 DLC and the items never actually appeared in game. According to the lazy dev they shouldve been in the underground bunker trunk, yet they were not.  TLDR - Game is ♥♥♥♥. Dont be fooled by the paid positive reviews, this hot steamer should be removed from the Store for false advertisement.",

I found out that this game is frame capped, and in order to change any video settings, you have to go to the files. Then, my friend couldn't move his character. He restarted, then found out all he had to do was hit C. Now my other friend is trying to build a bow. Nevermind, he built his bow. Now he is trying to build arrows for his bow, but he needs a machete. The lightning needs to stop.   10/10",

And upon each 5 or 10 camp levels, you are able to do a short survival test to further improve yourselves.   Below are the pros and the cons that I've summed up over my playtime~  Pros: 1. Logically, the guns will attract zombie hordes unless you have a silencer. 2. DLC don't really feel like a rip off. 3. Newer zombie types, including infected animals makes grinding for exp worthwhile. 4. Melee executions! 5. Rifle executions!!  Cons: 1. Game session isn't self-hosted. Potential lag at times. 2. Most crafted melee is only limited to heavy weapons. 3. Smalltime survival horde for camp upgrade is too short 4. Lack of camp building/walls design. 5. Too much locked doors.  Conclusion~ Overall, this game is pretty good! There's room for improvement such as more objectives when reaching the max level, but so far I have not encountered any major problems that spoils the fun in the game. The price's pretty much affordable even without the discounts.  -Edits- Additional Pros: -  Additional Cons: 1. Need an in-game text messaging system.",

It's well made with good graphics, a very interesting/funny story (Kovac) and a really cool gameplay style for a zombie survival game. It would be a lot better with friends but is still good enough solo. Definately a great game if you can get it on sale... or not :)",
