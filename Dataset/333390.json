            "review_text": "Very enjoyable VN/RPG.  Both genres are well executed - it is a full-fledged RPG, with VN storytelling instead of usual to a genre cinematics.   It feels very solid, much more than it's predecessor, Loren The Amazon Princess. In some way we get only a subset of content from LtAP - less classes, less monsters, less fights, less towns - but at the same time it is a right subset, it gives more details and variety. Like, for example, you don't fight hordes of same demons, you only encounter them several times, and each encounter is interesting. Regular monster packs change just as you are accustomed to fight them, but before they begin to annoy. Fights are now less about buff-spam and require some choices and timing. Especially on Hard!  Speaking of solid - characters and game world seems to be more worked on. Dialogs are no way cheesy (which was sort of a problem with Loren), every scene is executed great, with a good script and immersive visuals. And some scenes were really stunning. It was a great experience when lighthearted story was turning into something more serious.  Art is definitely a game's strong point. Yes, you are getting what you see on screenshots. And it may be missed, but the game doesn't reuse content much. Many locations and NPCs are getting appropriate graphics instead of generic ones. Followers have a great variety of costumes they wear. CGs are not numerous, but timely. And those unnoticeable small things really add to immersion.  Can't miss out the romances, since it is VN and Winter Wolves' VN. Personally I haven't enjoyed them. Possible partners are not really appealing. Straight choice for Althea conducts himself like a haughty idiot, and following that storyline feels unnatural and cheesy. So romances weren't a part of a game for me.   By the way, had I said that Althea is absolutely fascinating character? It is just drawing and some lines of text, but she does seems fleshed-out, and she is amazing. With her kind heart and openness there is no wonder she became the leader of the group. And for a runaway slave she has quite a taste for pretty costumes!  Bottom line. If you liked Loren The Amazon Princess, what do you want? It is the same but more. Grab at the nearest sale! If you like the art, get it, the gameplay doesn't let down game art's quality. As a VN, it is one of the best you can encounter on Steam. Not much a competitor with major RPG titles, though - but a good one for indie tier.  If you decide to buy it, consider buying DLC as well - ending is quite rushed and not impressive without it.",

            "review_text": "This game is a Visual Novel/RPG Hybrid. If you like games with good narrative and also happen to like RPGs, this might be a good game for you.  STORY The game develops in a fantasy land called Aravorn. The main characters are a pair of snow elves that have to endure a series of hardships due to a twist of fate. In their quest, they will meet allies and friends that will join them to help them, but they also have their personal problems which you may want to tackle or just ignore them. The story is well written and the characters are deep and coherent (all the coherent that Rowinda can be…) and the main story as well as the personal stories of each character are quite good. You also have a few romantic interests to choose from and allow you to dig deeper into the personality of some of the characters. The story is probably the best aspect of the game.  ART/ANIMATION As a Visual Novel, don’t expect high quality graphics and 3D animation obviously. However, the art is quite good. The character design is pretty nice, and a lot of the backgrounds are gorgeous. On the other hand, animations are scarce and simple, especially in combat where you would expect something else maybe.  MECHANICS The game follows the usual Visual Novel system of make your decisions, combined with a map where we can decide which place to visit next. The combat mechanics are pretty nice, with each character having an array of skills which allow the player to develop diverse strategies depending on how you develop them as they level up.  MUSIC AND SOUND The game soundtrack is quite good. It blends perfectly with the tone of the story in almost every scene and the combat themes are quite catchy. The SFX are nice too, although the number of combats and the abuse of certain skills might make you hate some of them.  OVERALL Good music, memorable characters, an interesting story and a quite entertaining combat system make this game worth it. Don’t leave the mysteries of Aravorn unsolved and go for it. Furthermore, if you played Loren: The Amazon Princess and liked it, you can’t miss this one, and if you haven’t, then I really recommend you both games.  ",

            "review_text": "Comparable to Loren. For me the story was not as good, but it was a more challenging and tactical game than Loren. Nightmare was definitely challenging. Mind you, personally I tend to find long chains of cures more frustrating than challenging and I am not sure that is the way to go for making fights more interesting...",
