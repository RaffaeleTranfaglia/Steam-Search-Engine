This is an arcade styled game where you shoot up chickens in your spaceship. Waves, bosses, pick-ups, you name it!  Easy to play and very enjoyable.  10/10",

Single player or Online Co-Op, You'll have lots of fun playing this title. The game has some minor kinks, like with all games. However, it doesn't take away from the experience of the game itself. And, If you're as die-hard a gamer as me, then you'll see a lot of near and dear references, both painfully clear, and some that are hidden a bit. It adds to it's charm so well. The story is pretty funny, and it has a charm all it's own as well.  One thing I will say, though: You'll get super hungry If you love chicken. ^_^",

When I saw this game on Steam myself, I want to play this game again. Yeah, I beat a game!  I love this game. Graphics most looks like a 3D...but it is actual 2.5D anyways. Soundtracks are pretty good. I can say that, I love every musics on the game. Story is PERFECT and EPIC!! And little comedy.  I noticed there're some Star Wars reference.... (Hen Solo...and his ship is looks similar from Star Wars...And there's one scene look-a-like a Death Star?)",

            "review_text": "Whether you play this game because you want to save your planet from the chickens, to save the fried chicken business from ending, or you just love shooting and killing angry chickens, you will enjoy this game. Although it is a rather short game, it contains some funny cutscenes, and destroying those chickens and get some fried chicken out of it made me a little happy.  The main character is not your average hero. All he cares about is fried chicken. He does not agree to help Hen Solo before he finds out that there will be no more fried chicken if he does not. This is but the beginning of a great adventure through a couple of galaxies.  The gameplay is rather straight-forward, as all you do is click to shoot and move your mouse to move. However, that does not make the game easy or boring. The fact that it has such simple mechanics makes it a great game to play if one ever feels a little bored and does not feel like playing a bigger game. The online feature did not work out that well (Unless, of course, it is just my laptop failing me as it usually does).  All in all, I would recommend this game.",

I mean a game where you shoot chickens in space while collecting their essences of goodness (Chicken) is an amazing concept, right? Anyway, this game has a lot of features to it that make it a really good game. All the weapons you are able to pick ranging from red lazers to purple alien plasma stuff is just amazing. The bosses you face are also very unique. Some including Super Chicken, Space Crab (Thing), and my favorite the Iron Chef. Overall this is a really fun game to pass the time and enjoy the little things in life... Chickens.",
