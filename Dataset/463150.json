The simple controls make it fairly easily to just pick up and play, yet still gives you quite the challenge for each level you unlock. I do wish there were more levels though, but by itself, it's still a great game.  My Rate: 9/10",

            "review_text": "  Similar w/ super hexagon (BUT IT'S NOT SAME), a challenging &amp; SIMPLE action game.  Good for someone that's looking a game to skip time, or someone that wants to play a challenging game. Don't buy if you're a ragequitter. (yeah, just don't buy if u played flappy bird and ragequit after 1~10 tries, lol)  The game have 7 levels Each level just adds a new type of obstacle or something. Unlock the next level by flying for 30 seconds in a level.  Pros: + 7 challenging levels + Lovely art (Dunno what to call it, Simplistic maybe?) + CHEEAAAAPP  Cons: - The music rythm isn't corresponding w/ the game - Too hard for some ppl (some ppl rage quits after playing once)  THERE ARE LESS THAN 1% PPL THAT BEATED ALL THE LEVELS (from global stat) [TO DEV: try to find a middleground, where it's not too hard and not too easy]  *I received the key for free from the dev for review purpose (but it doesn't affect my review)",
