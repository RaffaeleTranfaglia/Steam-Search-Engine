SURVIVAL is a mode where if a block falls 3 times. And RACE is where you pile up until you get to the top. I reccomend this game for 1 player and multi player :steamhappy:",

            "review_text": "Got this game from the developers themselves with a 33% discount, so there goes all my bias.  This game is an incredible twist on a classic mechanic, namely Tetris with Physics, you start with a small island in which you have a variety of game modes, ranging from building and surviving as well as building a high tower.  The game also has power ups like rooted blocks or spawning another island, but also some debuffs like icy blocks (which are a pain), and gigantic blocks(not as useful as it sounds) .  The only downside me and my other friends have found is the absence of a music and sound slider, as of right now it is a toggle. (I've heard the developers are aware of this, so it might be changed in the future.)",

            "review_text": "An extremely enjoyable legally distinct block placing game, which uses steamworks, and has a fun physics element. In Tricky Towers you use different shaped blocks to build towers under certain restrictions, depending on what game mode. There are 3 game modes available (+1 special modifier for each) and supports up to 4 player multiplayer. There are also a large number of singleplayer stages to complete.  In Race mode, you must build a tower faster than your opponents to reach a certain height. In survival, you must use all of the blocks given to you, however you can only have up to 3 collapses. In Puzzle, you are given a piece of terrain in which you must carefully place your blocks to build a tower with a given height restriction (But the terrain you start on is extremely narrow, so the challenge comes from using the blocks to expand horizontally).  The physics element adds a lot, which means rickety, shoddily-based towers will likely collapse, which may be fatal depending on the game mode. There are also magic spells, named light and dark magic, which you can use to buff your own tower, or sabotage your enemies. A light magic spell example would be a binding spell, which binds the next block you place with those surrounding it, making it stronger and more stable. A dark magic example would be fog, which clouds the enemy towers and makes it difficult to see where to place blocks. The magic spells all drastically affect the outcome of the game, and you can even use light magic to turn an enemy's dark spell that has been used on you to your advantage.  Puzzle went from my least to my most favourite mode, as block placement needs to be careful and precise, and you need to plan ahead with how the tower you create will take shape. I would say the hardest mode would be survival with it's special modifier, as in this mode you must survive with waves of dark magic thrown at all players.  I'd like to see more functionality, like a chat or even a simple VGS system. However this doesn't affect the game much. In the future I'd perhaps like to see some kind of coop game mode.   It's relatively inexpensive and I strongly recommend this game.",

My wife and me got board under an hour. tried all the modes. got repeitive quick for us.  I reccomend for kids 10 and under ish. if your looking for any challenge this proably isent it. based of how the blocks fall I dont trully beilive it phsyics base. You and your oppenet can have identical layouts (at lest from what you can tell by naked eye) but some reason one of them will fall some want. and im not reffering to any powers or anything like that we tried it several times to do identical things and the results did not match up.",

            "review_text": "Finally a tetris game With local and online multiplayer and with physics?.   The game feels too lightweight for its price and unlike tetris you have no hard drop facility in this game which makes it a bit slow paced game. A small screw up could alter your game drastically.   Most of the time you end up playing two players rather than 3 or 4 as you see in this screen shots.   It lacks key binding option and default keys a very uncomfortable(U, I, J, K, UP ,DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). I thought it would be like one of those addictive tetries game but slowly you lose your interest and you will check that how much time you played it so you can request a refund(Well I acted faster). This game could use some updates But its not worth the money right now.  And I'm a big fan of tetris .  ",
