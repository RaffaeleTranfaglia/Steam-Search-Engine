            "review_text": "Shiver: Vanishing Hitchhiker is the first in a series of beautifully crafted, horror-themed hidden object titles by Artogon Games. Originally released in 2011, the game holds up incredibly well even by today’s standards. An excellent example of a hidden object and adventure game hybrid (HOPA), it appeals to both HOG and Adventure gamers alike. With a chilling story that lacks the campiness of other games, somewhat challenging point ‘n’ click gameplay, and breathtakingly gorgeous artwork, there’s very little for me to complain about when it comes to this classic of the hidden object genre.
