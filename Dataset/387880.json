    "description": "Ninjahtic Mind Tricks is an 8-bit hack-and-slash platformer with stealth, adventure, and puzzle elements. Like it's predecessor, Ninjahtic, levels have an open-ended nature and are presented in a linear fashion. Though, several features have been added to the predecessor's formula to create a more varied experience.",

            "review_text": "Very solid game. Extremely tight controls and a fair difficulty (whenever I died, I felt it was because I messed up, not because the game was poorly designed).   The main character is just plain FUN to move around. She can double-jump, climb up and down walls, dash, air-dash and more. Attacks (so far) include a basic quick attack and a heavy attack that launches enemies either horizontally or vertically (depending on where you attack from). You can juggle enemies in the air, and even step on them (some of them?) for use as temporary platforms.  The environmental hazards are as deadly to enemies as they are to you. Combine that with your launcher attack, and you have a 2d game that provides the same sort of 'kick the enemies into the spikes/off the cliff' fun as Bulletstorm. Satisfying and often hilarious.  While there's an interconnected world that you occasionally have to backtrack in, each screen is its own little puzzle. You have to defeat all enemies AND make it to the exit area in order to continue. There are no lives. If you die, you restart at the start of the current *screen*, which removes a lot of the frustration from the game.  I mentioned backtracking. I've only had to do it once, so far. (You come across a locked door in the middle of a screen. The key is found a few screens later. You must then go back to open the door.) Unlike many other games, this didn't feel like a chore. The puzzle-y nature of the screens meant that going backward felt like a completely different challenge than going forward the first time.  Art design is good, with two exceptions: ledges and pipes that you can climb on can occasionally melt into the non-interactive background.  At time of writing, the full price for this game was $2.19 CDN, or about $1.99 USD. At that price, this game is an absolute steal. It's easily worth five times that. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "fun concept, annoying implementation. thought from descriptions I'd get more 'stealth' options, but every room requires you to beat up all present enemies before proceeding. Given that there are a ton of small rooms at the beginning of the game (after tutorial) this game is IMMEDIATELY tedious and reppetative. wouldnt reccomend even at current $0.79 price point",
