Other than the first 2 choices in the game, you'll know exactly where the plot is going from that point when it has you make a decision.(not that it takes away from the experience) There are 8(thats as many as o found in my exploratory playthroughs) different decision points.   Negative points &gt;It only takes roughly 2.5 hours to go through every playthrough collectively. &gt;The is no dialogue audio, only background music. &gt;The story has little uniqueness among anime, Its essentially the two animes 'Special A' and 'Zero no tsukaima' blended together in short story form. &gt;There is little replayability once you've played through all the different options.  Positive points &gt;The background music is fitting and interesting. &gt;The quality of images and backgrounds is great. &gt;The dialog is well written, i found only one typo. &gt;It has trading cards. ;3",

It is a cute game with nice artwork, but there is some controversy around it in the EVN community. Originally this game was released for free with voice acting, which the Steam version does not have.  The main character is a princess who has never really been disciplined or spent much if any time outside the palace. She makes a bet with her older brother, and goes to public school. One route is that typical smart guy she fights with, and the other is her bestfriend/servant. It is cute, but I don not know if it is worth $5 especially since it was originally released for free. If you get it I would wait till it goes on sale.",

The art is nicely done and the CGs are a great addition, I only wish there was a place to look at them once they were unlocked during the game. If it cost any more I'd perhaps question whether it were worth the purchase, but for its current price it's a pretty good deal and you should get your moneys worth if you enjoy this sort of thing...",

The story and characters are unoriginal, which could be salvaged if the writing was decent but it's also very underwhelming. The truly disappointing feature of this game is its length. To get all possible endings you are looking at approxmiately one hour of playtime. Total. Perhaps I would be more forgiving/interested if I wasn't so bored of overdone anime tropes, so if you still enjoy the tsundere thing and don't expect anything other than nice art you might enjoy this game, considering the low price.",
