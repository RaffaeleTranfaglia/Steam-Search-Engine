            "review_text": "After playing through the full (post early access) release, the verdict is in and I can confidently say that Skulls of the Shogun is a winner. This quirky turn-based strategy game seems simple at first, but there are actually some surprisingly deep levels of nuance and complexity beneath the surface. You play as a Japanese swordsman General who is trying to reclaim his stolen identity in the afterlife. The art style is very unique and really well done. The cast of characters and story are also very cool. The dialogue, in particular, is a highlight. I wasn't expecting much from that aspect of a seemingly simple strategy game, but I was pleasantly surprised at how funny and entertaining it was.  So the aesthetic portions of the game are definitely good, but what of the actual gameplay, you ask? In short, it's pretty damn good. Gameplay is turn based, but on each turn you have 5 'orders' that can be performed. Your team is comprised of various types of units (warriors, cavalry, archers), each of which has their own strengths and weaknesses. Instead of moving on tiles like other strategy games, the actions in this game are more free-roaming. Units are able to move anywhere they want, within a certain radius, and are also able to continue moving after performing an action, which adds to the level of strategy involved. One of your main goals is to eat the skulls of defeated opponents, which restores health. However, if a unit is able to eat 3 skulls, they transform into a Demon, which enables them to perform 2 actions per turn, which is a huge advantage. Gameplay becomes a delicate balancing act of attacking, positioning and staying alive long enough to power up.   Outside of these main elements, there are a number of other nuances (summoning monks with special powers, forming spirit walls, environmental hazards, deciding when to bring your general into battle, and more) that add many layers of complexity to the basic strategy. Every level seems to provide some new elements to learn or deal with, and this keeps the main campaign fresh from start to finish. There's no padding at all. The main campaign lasts several hours (more if you play on a higher difficulty or attempt to complete the set of special goals for each level) and is worth the price of admission alone. In addition, the game also features online, local and asynchronous multiplayer matches. So there is plenty of content here for both casual and competitive types.   All in all, this game is solid and brings some really cool twists to the turn-based strategy genre. If you are into that type of thing, pick this one up. And if not, well, this could be the game that makes you a fan. Check it out.",

            "review_text": "well this turn based strategy game is very addicting. I've only played the single player/campaign mode and I couldn't find multiplayer match :( . I guess the multiplayer has been 'long gone' or maybe I just couldn't find any player online. In this game you are playing as a afterlife general in shogun era (I always think general = shogun himself), nah don't think to much.  you are able to control several units and it does have the feel of advanced wars on DS without grid. the concept are same, there are resources/paddy field to conquer, statue/jizo that act as unit spawn place or towers that will do 1 damage in the beginning of each player turn. the AI unit and level design is smart, the game doesn't feel too hard or too easy, but the challenge is hard and sometimes you have to repeat few times to get all skulls (like stars from mobile games)   the music, gameplay and graphics of this game are well done made. the control however does have a bit of problem. I use logitech wireless x-input, I think this game was planned to be steam and mobile game, and to pick a unit from a controller you have to use dpad , sometimes a unit won't be selected -- this is just minor issue and maybe the problem didn't exist if you use mouse as you can select by clicking the unit. I just like to use controller if possible.  I saw the credits and I didn't find japanese name on it.. or maybe I just missed it, I thought the developers are from Japan, but it's not -- well, it's not important where they come from as long as they brought great game to play!",

            "review_text": "Using the interface with a mouse just ruins this game, it was obviously designed for a touch screen. Your cursor is a massive clumsy pointer that makes it extremely difficult to select and move units that are close together. Getting your units in a proper formation is an exercise in frustration, but managable if that was the only problem.   Making any moves takes extra clicks because of the limitations of a touch screen first interface. For example, hovering over units to see their hp doesn't work, you must left-click to select each of them individually to see hp and then click back on the unit you were planning on using (once to select it, once to 'activate' it, and a third time to make it actually do anything) These things were solved in the 90s and so the controls feel similar to a bad console port.  If you have a windows 8 touchscreen tablet and like games like advance wars this would be great, otherwise avoid it unless you're willing to wrestle with your mouse.",

            "review_text": "GENEOUS... PURE GENEOUS on an epic level.  This is by for the most dynamic strategy board game I have ever player... I'm not comparing this to Warhammer, so don't think I'm referring to massive game boards like that... this is more twice to four times the size of chess, with about the same number of pieces.  Yes, I compare this game to chess... I dare say that this game is the evolution of chess. There are no spaces, or square counts. There is movement distantce and proximity combined with ranged attacks... If you attack with a piece, be careful to make sure you have some movement left over (the little thing white circle tells you that).  The controls are clever, elegant... Not complicated or complex.   The map variety is nice, though we could use bigger maps for two players to face off with massive armies like the 4v4 fujin falls map, not the 2v2 version.  All in all, this game sets a very high bar, and a new standard of board games.  This game gives you the biggest bang for your buck on steam without a doubt.   BUY IT!!! Learn it. Enjoy it!   P.S. The campaign has to be the best tutorial i have every played. Very funny and enjoyable story. ",

After being betrayed Akamoto general on the battlefield, goes to the underworld to find a waiting line 500 thousand years to the gates of heaven, unhappy to be one of the greatest generals and not have free passage to the gate, discovers after soldiers mock him that someone took his place, and next to an army that could stand not waiting in line, go behind the imposter.  A highly recommended game strategy that will make you take a lot of laughter with every single character of the generals and soldiers and of course the gods, who just want to mess up.

You level up in a linear style as you are unable to grind for extra experience points which makes your level kind of redunant. Equiping emblems seems to serve no purpose in regards to gameplay.  Not a bad game but glad I only paid Â£2.99 for it as it is extremely linear and due to this the game gets boring after around the 5th level.",

The game utilizes a colorful, cartoony and fun style while also featuring slightly serious combat, making you think about your strategy and the fine placement of your troops or else you will die. And the game does a good job reminding you of it, as failures will be often if you don't quickly adopt the right state of mind. It's important to note that the game is not frustrating, but pleasantly challenging, a fine line that I feel many games overstep. While the campaign's comedy is kinda cheesy, it features a good story and excellent multiplayer. Me and my friends enjoy the hotseat option, like a virtual board game!",

The creators say they based the game on Advance Wars, and it really does take all the best gameplay elements from that game while developing its own unique feel. It offers the best tactical and strategic gameplay since Fire Emblem, a series I have a great amount of respect for. The only criticism so far is that the dialogue in the campaign mode contains tons of references that feel REALLY forced. The Super Mario Bros. and Anchorman quotes made sense in the context of the story, but the references really got out of hand when one of the characters quoted lyrics from Poison's 'Every Rose has its thorns' for no reason (something like this happens at least once per cutscene). But the gameplay is 100% solid. You have multiple viable commands to give your units every turn, and the pacing of aggression versus gaining strength almost always presents a few gripping decision points per turn. This game is absolutely worth the $5 price tag.",

It's not easy so you do have to think and plan quite ahead. This is what usually bothers me with tactical turn based games, is that theyre too easy. Here, there is some challenge and you feel really happy when youve finished a stage.  The only downside is that I've got no clue how the multiplayer works. There seems to be an online one but I don't get it. I never find any games to join. Wish there was a more of an explanation for this... or how to play the multiplayer.
