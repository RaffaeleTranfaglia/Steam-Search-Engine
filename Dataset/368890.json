            "review_text": "This game is part 3 of the series, and it has better overall polish than parts 1 and 2. In the first two installments, they established the setting and characters, though the game mechanics were not polished. The puzzles were troublesome more on account of a clumsy user interface, though this was in addition to the puzzles being somewhat obscure (i.e., just keep rubbing items together until something works).  Part 3 is a more satisfying, polished experience, in terms of plot structure, character motivations, puzzle logic, artwork, and user interface. If you want to skip parts 1 and 2, then all you need to understand for part 3 is the following:   -- SPOILERS --    The lead character (Alicia) was framed for having stolen a golden sphere, about the size of a softball. The sphere is a piece of high technology that can hold an electric charge. The origins of the sphere are unknown, though more is revealed in part 3.  Alicia has a love interest (Blaine) that works for a corporation that has an interest in the golden sphere.  Blaine has an ex-love interest whom also works for the corporation.  Alicia has a friend, Franky, who is essentially an alien minotaur. Though Franky was a minor supporting character in parts 1 and 2, he takes on a more important role in part 3.  ",

I had a lot of fun playing this game and I am surely looking out for the fourth part. I can recommend this game to everyone who loves adventures, especially the 3rd part as about as good as an adventure can get :)  Highly recommended (and bare with the first part, its fun as well!)",

I liked all of the episodes, but I really appreciated that Alicia, the main character, didn't really swear in this one. She was still sassy and spunky though, which is the part of her personality that I like. This was a fun and funny puzzle solving adventure game that I really enjoyed, along the same lines as Monkey Island and in the tradition of King's Quest (with fewer puns and dying). ",
