            "review_text": "As of this writing, 49% of the reviews for this game are positive. This is frankly, to me inexplicable as this is the worst game in my library of 90 so far. What makes this game obnoxiously bad, egregiously terrible is that it has surface appeal. It deceives the experienced player of roguelikes into thinking that strategic and thoughtful play will be rewarded if one can intuit the subtle rules of the game. Don't waste your time. There is no depth of gameplay here. For example, you find a potion. Will it hurt you or heal you? It's random. It might give you a permanent defect. Or it might heal you. There is no way to tell unless you drink it. Intelligent decision making in this game amounts to not wasting a precious minute of your life on this cynical trap created by a soulless programmer whose only goal was to part you from your hard earned money. It is one of the most offensively designed games I ever played in my life. I am passionate in my hatred of this game. Good day sir or madam.",

            "review_text": "I strongly recommend you avoid this rogue-like. Since I can't really think of any pros that this game contributes to the genre, I'm just going to talk about the flaws.  This game is BRUTAL. I know rogue-likes are supposed to have you constantly die over and over but at least you make progress and learn a little more about the game each time you play through. However, I don't feel this way at all when playing this game. Well okay, I learned one thing.  This game practically eliminates 1/3 of your class choices. By attacking with warrior-like classes, you're guaranteed to miss most of your attacks and die within 3 minutes. With ranged classes, you, for whatever reason, have a higher accuracy and don't run as high a risk of getting hit, even with your health being low.  Speaking of which, it's almost impossible to get back any health you lose. In other games you find potions to restore your health and your armor is actually an important statistic. However, in this game, the potions are extremely rare, they don't always give you health (and the ones I've found give less than 10 HP), and with as much armor as I could find, I was still taking FIFTEEN damage from an enemy on the first floor of the game! Also, you start off with either 20, 30, or 40 HP, so...  Speaking of the floors in this game, the chances of completing a floor, or even moving on to the next floor, are low, really low. These floors are massive, and while that may not be the worst thing, there's no inventory system, and consider the flaws I've mentioned before. I've gotten to the second floor ONCE out of all my playthroughs, and naturally I lasted no more than a minute. My luck, huh?  Speaking of luck, the biggest problem is the randomized generation this game has. I'm not thrilled with starting a game, having two enemies appear in front of me, me missing my attacks, and dieing without making A SINGLE MOVE. Also, like I said before with the damage, I don't find it really fair that an enemy on the first floor could whittle down a chunk of my health before even going through more than five rooms.",

The difficulty is just as brutal and unforgiving as the ancient and free ascii/tileset roguelikes. The only mercy is that stronger playable characters are unlocked through number of deaths as well as wins so, since you will be dying a lot, it won't all be in vain.  You start with a warrior, archer and wizard and, from there, can unlock around 30 additional classes to play. There are a handful of different quests you can undertake, which will decide the types of enemies you'll be up against, dungeon layout and general mood.   Besides having achievements, there is nothing special or fun about Hack, Slash, Loot in comparison to all the free roguelikes out there. I would only recommend paying for it to a hardcore roguelike enthusiast; anyone else who wants a traditional roguelike on Steam should just play Dungeons of Dredmor, Sword of the Stars: The Pit or Tales of Maj'Eyal.",

The game can be fun but frustrating aswell. there are a few strategy guides out there that can help you but again you cannot control when your character dies.  The game does have a decent number of characters, no skill tho, only items being gear(armor/wep/accesory which only boost/nerf your stats), a decent number of achievements, not a big number of maps tho, espite each of them beeing randomly generated each time.

You don't unlock character by winning, you unlock them by dying in the same dungeons with the same 3 characters until you unlock the Amazon character (which starts with one of the only 'good' items).

Expect no updates other than trading card artwork.  The only perks I am able to squeeze out of this unforgiving rock are that I enjoyed the simplistic artwork, and that there were no visible game breaking bugs.

The game is horrendously unbalanced (both characters and items). There is no way to heal? I am not sure, I have not found anything in the 40 times I have died playing. There are 3 playable characters in which two of them are absolutely USELESS. Nothing is based on player skill, it is all based on stats.  Most of the time I have been dying is because I would click on an enemy, but instead of attacking, my char uses its turn to move on that square and being hit for every square subsequent to getting to that goal.   It was a 'decent' time killer with a bit of breath for nostalgia but I do not recommend this to anyone that has any expectations to blow them away.

            "review_text": "Another instantly addicting game, Hack, Slash, Loot by developer David Williamson is a work of turn based martial art. Roguelike, you have to take every chance, try every door and kill every creature in your path. Incredibly fun to play, you donât know who or what is in the next room, leaving you on the edge of your seat making Hack, Slash, Loot a go to game.  First starting the game you are given the option of a Human, Wizard or Archer, with continued gameplay you are able to unlock another 29 over time. Throughout the game you will encounter hordes of monsters, demons, zombies, and a manifold of other creatures to battle. Being turn based, you have to wait your turn, so be prepared to click frantically until your turn comes only to miss and do it again. With that being said its not all clicking, there is a deeper level of gameplay involved in Hack, Slash, Loot. This game involves a tactical insight and understanding beyond pointing and clicking. Each different quests embodies another set of skills and approach at the game. The possibilities are endless, mixing and matching of accessories and armor make every run different and add a new level of excitement and draw to the game.  There are dark places in the world inhabited by evil denizens. Places filled with danger and foreboding where no ordinary man would dare to journey. However, there are a few who are willing to risk death in the name of good, in the name of justice, in the name ofâ¦ valuable loot! Depending on what quest you choose you are given a backstory to give you a sense of what your goal is in your adventure. Within each of the different quests you encounter various creatures and characters that have roles in the story, or provide dialog pertaining to whats at hand. While some quests are easier than others, each are sure to keep you on your toes.  Play for a few minutes or get more serious and sit down for a few hours, the more you play Hack, Slash, Loot the deeper you become involved. The retro appeal of this game really sells it the most, imagine Realm of the Mad God meets MS-DOS Dungeons and Dragons, imagine Final Fantasy Tactics meets Hammerwatch, imagine playing while watching the animated Lord Of The Rings, because thats what I did and now I love this game. You have a control panel in front of you while navigating your hero throughout each quest. To the left you have the status of your character displaying armor and stats. In the middle, a mini map that lights up as you explore each room, this also serves as a quick point and click to get you across the level faster. On the right, the description and status of each tile, chest, monster or whatever you hover the mouse over.  With only the life you are given to start you must find chests or overturn dead bodies in order to find scrolls or potions to boost your health as well as other stats at the same time. These scrolls and potions are critical to gameplay and make Hack, Slash, Loot almost impossible to play without them. With 32 different classes to choose from, 6 unique quests, and an endless mixture of armor, weaponry and gear makes Hack, Slash, Loot an instant classic and a must have for any indie gamer.

        {
            "review_text": "In all fairness, Hack, Slash, Loot (HSL) is a decent rogue-like. Realistically, how would any human fare trying to kill a dungeon full of ogres, undead skeletons or parasitic demons that burst out of his fallen comrades? The answer: he'd probably die long before reaching his goal.  HSL's main feature is arguably the starting character choice and the initial artifact they can bring with them (in case they have unlocked it). You start out with 3 mostly crap characters and then you unlock more through either  a)  successfully clearing a session or  b)  dying a certain number of times until the next unlock threshold. For most people, their first few unlocks may be the death based ones.  An 'interesting' design choice was the strengths/weaknesses of elements in the game. To sum it up, every element has a chance of doing some effect. If you're strong against the effect, you take half the damage and never suffer from the effect of that element; if you're weak, however, you take double damage and the chance of being applied the element's effect is increased. This comes with some very nasty consequences, such as being poisoned for a bad evasion roll or having a random piece of your equipment destroyed by fire. It gets even worse when you figure out that holy and dark elements' effect is applied when you kill something and that both give you health, increased accuracy (aka hit enemies more often) or even increased damage: the game is practically forcing you to find and stick to a holy/dark weapon combo of melee, ranged or magic varieties, since randomly finding a potion and carelessly using it without knowing what its affix might do is bound to either screw all you've worked for or not heal you when you'd really want some health.  HSL also starts handing you characters that are arguably better for specific dungeons or have gameplay variability to help you find your niche. One particular character has intrinsically magic resistance, for instance: you'd definitely want to bring him to at least two of the dungeons for that reason alone. But on the other hand, every character is more or less gimped in some way, and the arguable best stat to stock upon is armour (which, unfortunately, is more likely to come from your randomly dropped equipment than it is from being boosted from a potion) because it is applied BEFORE strengths and weaknesses come into play.  As for the artifacts, the undeniably best all-around one is the Mask of SomeMummyGuy (name forgotten, not the actual name), the goal from the crypt dungeon and forever unlocked once obtained. There is no real reason not to bring it with you either, since it boasts an incredible amount of armour and reasonable stat boosts for your offensive ability. Compare to the Butcher's Knife, which makes you walk twice a turn but does such an insignificant amount of damage that you'll be seeing the numbers 1 or 2 popping out when you attack something, or the Necronomicon, which if you aren't a melee character or don't have holy or dark weapons means you will also be hitting a lot less for the 'benefit' of being able to pass through walls (which may sound nice, but on most of the dungeons it simply means that if you don't clear a room FAST the monsters are going to start opening doors EVERYWHERE and the entire level is going to make a never-ending conga line to beat you up).  Also keep in mind, my worst gripe with HSL isn't about the gameplay but the accuracy of targetting itself, a game mechanic. As you may see from the screenshots, tiles are rectangular: they are wider than taller by a ratio of aproximately 2. And when you want to click on something, you HAVE to click on their bottom half, because otherwise you'd be targetting the tile above it. It also doesn't help that targetting a tile to move that is far away AFTER having seen a threat doesn't cancel the order to move unless you click again or are hit by a monster, and if you are trying to attack from a range that will mean you will most certainly get hit before you realize that you are moving instead of attacking, and that in itself will usually get you killed since ranged characters tend not to have the best survival up close.  But, as I said on the opening line, HSL is a decent rogue-like. Not too deep about it nor very long-lasting, but if you like rogue-likes you may enjoy it. Should you buy HSL? Maybe. Maybe on a 75% discount. I still hate the inefficient targetting system and how hard it is to move long stretches of the dungeon when you're on the last rooms to find the stairs, pixel-clicking on the map or hitting the wrong tile. If you think you can handle it go for it; don't bother otherwise.",

It all looks pretty basic and simple, you have probably already played more than a few roguelike and dungeoncrawling games, it seems that you're doing everything right, only you keep on dying all the time. It's also the biggest part of the game. It's like Dark Souls, only unfair since dying in Dark Souls has to do with your skill, skills which you can improve by trying and trying again. In Hack Slash Loot there isn't much skill involved, since most things are based on luck and are random. Although, it takes some time to understand the techniques and strategy that's behind this cruel little game.  And when I'm saying 'little', I don't think you can actually ever really finish this game and all it's quests. I've played around 10 hours, when writing this review, but I feel like I'm going to play it for quite some more.

Level layout and enemy generation both perfectly balance the procedural generation of a rogue-like with the intentionality of a well-designed level. Unfortunately, other randomized elements are less-than-perfect. With a peculiarly inverted difficulty curve, players will find the greatest initial challenge is persevering through the 25+ deaths required to unlock the first character truly capable of rewarding a player's skill with success. Each successive character is more powerful than the last, and although some strategy is necessary in combining character classes with various artifact 'loadouts,' most of the later unlocked characters make previous ones obsolete. Similarly, choosing wisely from the loot at the player's disposal requires careful consideration, but the randomness of enchantments and loot mean that a session typically ends in either frustrating defeat or unsatisfying triumph.   On the spectrum of skill vs chance, Hack, Slash, Loot is just a bit more random than most players will find rewarding. Nevertheless, there is a wealth of unlockables that may keep a determined gamer occupied for many hours. For its unique interface and enjoyable retro stylings, the game is commendable, but overall it comes off as a quirky experiment that doesn't quite make the cut.",

There is a bit of permanence in the form of unlockable characters (unlocked by getting a certain number of wins or deaths) and Relics you can find and then start new games with. While levels are randomized in typical roguelike fashion there are 6 quests that offer distinctly different flavors.  If you're having a bit of trouble at first here's a hint: die until you unlock the Amazon, then play the Mask of the Boy King mission, keeping your starting weapon (until the boss, who's resistant to it). Don't open Tombs but open everything else you see and bottleneck monsters in doors. If you can kill the boy king the burial mask he drops is a relic you can use on all further runs. :)",
