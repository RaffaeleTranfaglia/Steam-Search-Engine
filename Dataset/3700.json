            "review_text": "Sniper Elite taught me something about Sniper Games: that I don't like them.  I  thought  I liked sniper-type gameplay. The sniper rifle is my best friend in Borderlands, or Deus Ex, or L4D or any other game that will give me the option. But what I really like, it seems, is taking advantage of game AIs that don't contend well with a sniping approach. I love taking out foes that have 'taken cover' but left part of their heads sticking out. I adore taking the time to line up the perfect headshot as an enemy runs directly towards me, across open ground, in a straight line. I giggle when my shot from the rooftops drops an enemy in the middle of the street, which causes all buddies to rush out and cluster right in my sights.  Sniper Elite, first of all, is a strong adherent to the reality-is-brown school of graphical design. Which doesn't do any favours to the graphics, as they're already rather poor, even for 2005, relying too much on textures to save polygons. So you trudge through a bland, unimmersive environment in order to accomplish your mission, only to find that the usual AI-abusing sniper tactics don't work here. Unless you've played a level already and memorized the locations of the enemy NPCs, you have to sneak (slowly) everywhere, because NPC snipers are ready to do to you what you'd normally do to them if you go running around in the streets. So you have to be patient. Very, very patient. Which is boring. When the game  does  get exciting, it likes to do so by throwing a tank at you, or spawning a couple of guys at short range, so that you don't get to play with the sniper rifle anyway.  Between all the sneaking, and crawling, and waiting, and waiting some more, and crawling a bit, and waiting again, I've never had a less fun time with a simulated sniper rifle in my hands. On the plus side, the game did manage to capture the feeling of being a very vulnerable, mortal soldier, alone in a dangerous environment. I just prefer the feeling of being a cunning, dangerous predator, methodically eliminating hapless prey, and Sniper Elite was not going to give me that.",

Running and gunning CAN work on low difficulty settings, but crawling &amp; selecting sniping spots = most fun. Furthermore, noise plays a role - when emplaced enemies are within earshot but not line-of-sight, masking one's rifle shot with the sound of mortar fire (very common: it's May 1945 in Berlin) is wise and does work.  The kill cam is pretty fun but gruesome: most headshots will trigger a slo-mo, bullet-follow cam that'll show your shot. The game also tracks relevant stats (farthest shot, stealthy shots, head shots, etc).  Missions, when played stealthily, are long: I sunk 2 hours into the first one.  Awesome game. It requires the right mindset, but it's not overly hard if you really get into it.",

Im not opposed to stealth its just this game makes it difficult to do so. and checkpoint saves would have helped, (although you get 5 saves you can save anywhere anytime). you spend 30 min crawling through rubble and complete 2 obj and dodge a few tanks just to get shot in the back and have to start over. I Cant tell you how many grenades I took. Understanding the core of the game is the key to success. I put over 20 hours, mostly in replays caused by death, and have come out with a new appreciation for this game.

You work for the OSS, predecessor of the CIA, and your job to prevent the high-tech German scientists were working on from falling into Soviet hands. This means you will be fighting both Germans and Russians, usually behind enemy lines. You will crawl, sneak, walk, and run around the level, set traps to cover your back, make a silent kill or two, use sound of artillery to cover your shots, and so on. The levels are quite open, and enemies have patrol routes but will react to you and other factors. Actual approach is up to you. Ambush with bombs, shoot with gun, or other approaches? The interface is clunky due to console port laziness, but the 'bullet cam' where the viewpoint tracks the bullet and the kill lead to a lot of imitations since. All in all, this is a game that started the genre, and it can be extremely hard, but extremely rewarding. If you find this too hard, try its sucessor, Snipe Elite V2, a thoroughly modernized remake.",

            "review_text": "Personal rating: 4/10, worth playing, but only if you're patient enough.  Pros: -nice ballistic system: gravity, wind, your own heartbeat will affect your accuracy. -impressive headshots, kinda reminds me about Fallout 3/NV, except it's not as messy. -you can take a minigun and rush forward, but that's an easiest way to die. The game forces you to play as sniper, what a surprise. -missions are pretty interesting. Most of the times you have to infiltrate the heavily guarded territory (alarm = game over), take a position (optional: plant explosives everywhere), then start shooting like crazy in everyone.  Cons: -cities are pretty much empty. Most of the building are permanently locked, so you cannot enter them and you can't get on the roof for a good sniping position. Although some enemies are able to do that. And those roofs that you can enter are pretty useless, because AI instantly notices you there from afar. -and the worst part of this game: AI is pretty much broken. You can snipe an enemy out of bushes with one single bullet from a great distance and enemies will instantly know where it came from. It feels like I appear on their minimap like a big glowing dot right after the shot from any weapon without silencer (i.e. anything other than silenced pistol, which has awful accuracy on medium to long ranges). So after any shot all enemies on the map will be rushing towards you, no matter how well you hid or if you ran away right after the shot. What was the point of creating a game where you have to play sniper, but you also can't do that, I don't know. If not that, I'd easily rate this game 7/10, which is pretty good by my standards.   If you played first CoD and ever thought something like 'But I don't want be here, I want to be on that hill with a sniper rifle', this game is definitely for you. If you liked Rogue trooper, you'll probably like this game as well.  It felt like a good game indeed, but I guess I'm not patient enough. The last straw was the mission in a field with 2 enemy snipers, me and big ♥♥♥ gun that fired every 10 seconds or so. I thought it was put there by devs to provide sound masking option for stealthy sniping enemy snipers. So I counted seconds, then put a perfect headshot from ~200 metres in enemy sniper. I could have sworn this was a sound masked shot - I fired the same time with that cannon. But, apparently, second sniper somehow heard it and instantly saw me and started to shoot at me (I was ~300 metres away from him, crawling in bushes). So... ragequit. Very disappointing.",

            "review_text": "The Sniper Elite series was on sale a little while ago, and I thought the newest one (Sniper Elite III) looked pretty sweet. Being the way that I am, preferring to play games in order, I decided to buy the first one (for a mere $0.99, yay).  The concept of the game seemed rather cool. You take on the role of a sniper, but not in your typical first/third person 'run and gun' style. Instead, you have to have patience and move slow, staying hidden, picking your targets carefully and not necessarily trying to kill every enemy you see, taking your shots while keeping gravity, wind, and breathing in mind, then carefully changing locations once you've given your position away, etc. That kind of thought and detail usually makes gameplay that much more immersive to me, and I was very much intrigued.  Unfortunately, Sniper Elite is an older game, just having had its ten year anniversary, and as well as it did in some areas the game just didn't do it for me. The dated graphics didn't bother me much at all, but the overall gameplay and lack of any real story just really left me disappointed. The enemy AI, for example, was at times both ridiculously stupid and uncanny. One minute they couldn't see me crawling on the ground 10 feet away from them in 25% cover, and the next minute they pegged my location (in 75% cover AND hidden behind a wall) from around the block and a street over. My well thought out strategies, stealth and positioning were for naught, which frustrated me since that's what the game was supposed to be about.  As for the lack of story, I can understand why there wouldn't be if the game was trying to be realistic to a degree. Soldiers don't always know the reasons why, but follow orders and carry out the missions given to them. Still, after 9 hours of 'go meet this contact, infiltrate, snipe that bad dude, exfiltrate', I got extremely bored. And being close to halfway through the game already, I didn't see it changing during the second half by much if at all. Every mission felt the same, and the scenery only changed slightly.  With all that being said, I DID enjoy Sniper Elite up until that tedium set in. Plus, for the price I paid, I definitely felt I got my money's worth out of it. I just can't bring myself to play more and finish it now that it seems I've experienced all it has to offer and been left wanting. Some people might get to the same point and be perfectly content to keep going, I don't know, but I can't in good conscience recommend it.  Great concept, okay gameplay, but repetitive and very lackluster. 4/10",
