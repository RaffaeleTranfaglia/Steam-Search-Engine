            "review_text": "This is one of the easiest recommendations I'll have to give. Alien Robot Monsters (ARM) is a really addictive tower defence game.  The goal of each mission is simple. Your base is invaded by swarms of enemy robots and you must fend them off by strategically placing various military towers and tech buildings in the area. The enemies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, as you'd expect from any tower defence game, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. Likewise, each of your buildings is made to deal with a certain enemy type better than with others. Getting overrun by hordes of weak enemies? Get yourself some mortar towers. Having trouble with armoured tanks? Build an orbital laser. And so on.  After completing each mission, you get a rating out of 3 stars. If none of the enemies got through your defences, you get full 3 stars. If some went through, you get 1 or 2 stars. If too many get through, you lose the mission. The stars are not just there for you to feel proud, either. They're used as skill points to purchase upgrades to your buildings. Hence there's a lot of incentive to do well on each mission and even a chance to replay the harder missions later in order to get a better rating on those.  Normally there's no way of knowing what sort of enemies to expect in each mission, so the latter missions often require a bit of trial and error and can be quite hard. Regardless, I'm having a blast with the game. Fun gameplay and a great presentation. What more could you want?  If you've ever remotely enjoyed any tower defence games, give this one a try. It's really cheap and affordable despite its high quality.",

            "review_text": "I find this to be a relaxing tower defense game. I'd say it has 20 hours of content to play through all the way once the first time. That's what it took for me anyways, and I didn't succeed at every level the first time I played them.  The music of some levels seems a bit reminiscent in parts to the old 'Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan' in a space voyage-like theme. Blue marines shooting at the robots is reminiscent of old school starcraft.  If you like tower defense, I'd say this is one to pick up for sure. If you want a fairly low-key game you can pull out, play a little bit, and then extricate yourself this is also a really great choice for anyone.  If you get stuck on a level, just try something different. There actually are different ways of beating the harder levels, despite some people thinking otherwise. I've come back and replayed this a few times, so I know.  The other big complaint some people have is that the harder levels are not all at the end. They are sprinkled in different places in the game.",
