            "review_text": "I'd really like to be able to recommend this game, but I wanted to say it's one of the greediest games I've ever seen. You can't buy content such as costumes, wings, pets, etc... the way you can in other games, rather you pay to rent them (yes rent in-game content) and pretty much anything of worth you buy disappears after 30 days. Pets require premium cash-shop pet food to function.   I 'get' the Free To Play market, and I've spend decent amounts of money in F2P games before (like Star Trek Online) but this game takes it to another whole level. I just cannot recommend the game in it's current form, despite some truely great ideas and the fun idea of controlling an entire party of adventurers.",

The power creep released new characters, sometimes being cash shop only, left a bad taste. This game required a lot of time investment as a F2P player and to enjoy high-end content you really had to spend money for upgrading gear to acceptable levels the games PVE content required.",

            "review_text": "I played this game since GamersFirst had it and i've played countless hours, untill they switched publisher to T3. Not because of that, but because of Real Life, i left Granado Espada untill recently i saw it back on steam again.   First i want to state that a lot of the reviews given are based on earlier versions of this game (before steam and even before the current owner, T3). A lot have changed since then. For example: I've read a review that stated to progress after lvl 100, you need to pay. This is false. You pay some shiny crystals which drop enough within 30 minutes in (almost) every area to promote and advance.  Is this game pay to win? Depends on how you look at it i think. You can make enough ingame currency to get almost everything you want. There are a few things that are behind a paywall, but for sure not needed to win. The beauty about this game is that you don't have to do the grinding yourself. Leave them on a proper spot over night and you will have results. For my life, which includes a job, child and woman, this is ideal. I don't have to actively grind to progress, i can leave them and check later whenever i want to. But, patience is required with this game. If you are one of those greedy (usually kids) that have to have everything as fast as possible and expect it to be free, don't play!  Yes, sometimes it is a buggy game. But, look around you, what device or software comes without any bugs these days?  I would defenitaly recommend this game if you wanna play something else then generic. If you have a real life and still want some virtual fun, this one is a good one to play. Give it a try, it's free!",

Cons: --Old game. --Somewhat grindy as it takes a while before you get powered up.  Pros: ---Essentially, I love collecting all the characters (it's really tough for most of them, but worth it). ---Three-character system is different from the 'you only get to use one character' MMOs. ---You can set it to fight automatically and AFK.",

I even still have the BOX. never did i think it would ever come to steam let alone alive after they like killed it in 2009. then lots of people went to private server. give the game a try, back in 2006 this game got Game of the Year in Korea and had best graphcis. Its over 10 years old. free 2 play might have ruined the game and killed it again only time will tell.",
