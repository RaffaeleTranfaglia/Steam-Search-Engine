Maybe I'm missing some kind of big joke with this, but I played expecting it to actually be semi-insightful and instead was greeted by total BS. The concept of the game is actually mildy interesting, but the ending is just plain stupid.  Had potential. Did not deliver. 2/10",

I wish there were more ways you could interact with everything and different places you could go in the office and such, but it was ok for a free walking sim. You could get this and explore the office and do everything to make the 5 days go by. It's not a bad experience.",
