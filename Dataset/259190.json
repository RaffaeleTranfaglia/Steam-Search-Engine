            "review_text": "Alone in the Dark (4): The New Nightmare is a 3rd person survival horror game which was released in 2001. Some may say that it's a ripoff (see Resident Evil), but that's not entirely true. AITD4 is a reboot of the series which is placed in modern times. There are two playable characters with different, but interconnected storylines (similar to RE2), both have average playtime of 4-5 hours. The game has unique soundtrack (created by Low Distortion Unit) which is really atmospheric, scary and menacing. The game offers you limited amount of ammo which strengthens the element of survival horror. It also has puzzles which aren't that difficult (if you actually read in-game's files). There are powerful weapons such as double barrel revolver, triple barrel shotgun, plasma cannon, grenade and rocket launchers and other special weapons. I should also mention that the game also utilized a flashlight which is used for seeing dark areas, for puzzle solving and even as a weapon (see Alan Wake). The PlayStation 2 and PC ports have better FMVs, models and backgrounds, runs at 60FPS, however, the music is badly ported and sounds barely like the original (PlayStation 1). The Steam version of the game has a broken launcher and that's why I suggest getting the GoG version instead (or have them both?). With the proper launcher you can select any rendering resolution, but only 4:3 resolutions are recommended.  AITD is a truly scary game. The mixture of good soundtrack, atmosphere (including rain and thunder), flashes, sudden screams, supernatural monsters does it's job. Be sure to play at night and/or with headphones. Generally underrated game.",

            "review_text": "It can easily be argued that Alone in the Dark is the series that created the survival  horror genre. The first game was released in 1992 for the MS-DOS and laid the groundwork  for the genre. After a couple sequels the series fizzed away, until Resident Evil came  around and recreated survival horror. So obviously the original had to come back to the field  and compete, and what it came back with was Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare.  game starts with Edward Carnby, a private detective, finding out that his partner is  dead off the coast of Shadow Island. Edward soon learns of some ancient tablets that can  unlock a secret power. Edward teams up with Aline to find the tablets and avenge his friend's  death. Their plane is attacked by some mysterious creature, forcing them to parachute, become  separated, and become stuck on Shadow Island.  Here the game makes you decide which character you want to be, either Edward or Aline. Each  has their own storyline and adventure, which intersects at certain points. The gameplay  is what you would expect from a survival horror game. Your character controls like in Resident  Evil, where up moves forward and you pivot. The game also uses pre-rendered backgrounds,  that are in fact very detailed and dark. The game has a great atmosphere that is mostly  focused on darkness. You will grow to fear the darkness and the nightmare creatures that  lurk within it.  And like most survival horror games, the game has a heavy emphasis on combat and puzzle  solving. What is different is, while both characters will see their fair share of both,  one is more prevalent in each character’s campaign. Edward has his trusty double barreled  revolver and will always have it in hand. His story involves mostly fighting the nightmare  creatures. The enemies are very tough and ammo is scarce, making you have to know when  to stand up and fight, and when to run away. Aline starts off in a huge mansion and must  solve the puzzles littered through mansion to advance. It is interesting how they separated  these two gameplay mechanics, allowing you to play the game the way you want. But whether  you are solving puzzles or fighting monsters, the darkness will always be there.  This is a great return of the original of the genre. With the separate campaigns and  the beautiful but dark graphics, the game is full of tricky puzzles and terrifying enemies.  his is another strong reason why you should be afraid to be alone in the dark.",

After 10 minutes of continuous thunder looping in a joke of a storm,controls making it near impossible to move around, and me shooting a dog repeatedly while it chews on my leg like a milkbone, I finally gave up on this gem that is Alone in the dark :The new nightmare..The only nightmare was me wondering how this even got put on steam..GREENLIGHT FTW!!..",

            "review_text": "~ NOTE: Windows 10 breaks some visuals in the Steam ver. of the game. The community has found a fix for it and the game is now playable again after some fixes. If you don't want to bother with some fixing you can buy AitD 4 from GOG as well. ~  I've owned 3 different versions of this game, the original PS1 title that I got some 14 years ago, the PS2 title I bought so I didn't need to change discs and this Steam version for nostalgia and the fact I don't have the physical copies anymore. This said, I think I have some mileage with this game.   I still play this game through at least once a year on both characters and, in my opinion, it's one of the better horror games of the PS1 with good soundscape, visuals and gameplay, and it still holds up (or maybe that's just me).   It's a game every horror enthusiast should play at least once, and I highly recommend it to anyone who either likes horror games or old games.",
