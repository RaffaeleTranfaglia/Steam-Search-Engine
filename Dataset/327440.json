            "review_text": "Well, where should we start? I'm a huge fan of Avenged Sevenfold as a band, and when this game was announced, I was a bit sceptical. A music group creating a video game out of the blue? Sounds a bit off... After playing the game for the first time here on steam, I'd have to say that it's not half bad. Besides the few things that I noted down as my cons:  -Esc key closes the game. -(Youtube) When I try and record the game and commentate over it, the volume is set pretty loud, even though I turn it down in the mixer. -No graphical or audio settings. -gameplay is a bit stale, clicking and turning is the only tactic. -boss battles are repetitive.  Overall, it's a good game if I was going to play it on my iPad or something, good graphics, fun looting, a few unlockables.  If I had to rate this out of 10...   6.5/10 ",

            "review_text": "First of, this is going to be a very long review. But it should help you make up your mind whether you want to buy this game or not.  This game feels very much like diablo, ocarina of time and other amazing RPG's. The gameplay is really smooth when it comes to movement. The combat however gets a little repetitive after a while, but it is easy to remember and easy to execute.  The music is fantastic, no need to say anything else.  The collectibles are easy to find, the levels are amazing.  There is constantly a reference to avenged sevenfold's music.  There are two things which aren't as good as the rest of the game which are:  The Graphics and the character-design, specifically the playable characters.  The graphics are for mobile devices (and I respect that) but for the PC-version I would have expected a little better quality for the graphics. The characters' quality is also on the low side, but this could be improved with an update.  The playable characters look kinda lame, ( I expected something that would reflect them like their live performance) Matt looks by far the most amazing of the six playable characters.  I would rate this a solid   9 out of 10  ",

Thankfully, I was wrong.  Most of the textures are updated for 1080p (a couple look a little low res). The movement and sword attacks feel a lot smoother than they do on mobile and you don't have your own fingers covering half the screen in this version. One of my only complaints is that the magic attack is almost impossible to aim in the PC version.  The cut scenes look pretty bad and dated on PC, but I suppose that's acceptable seeing as it is a mobile port (and a pretty cheap one at that).  Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this game. If you're an Avenged Sevenfold fan, chances are you're going to enjoy this. There's plenty of references and songs in the game.",

            "review_text": "In Avenged Sevenfold's (well, really just M. Shadows) break into the gaming medium, we are given Hail to the King: Deathbat.  In HttK: Deathbat you play as a fallen king, Andronikos, hellbent on returning to his throne after the god of evil killed and replaced him with an evil twin.  The story, while laden with dark fantasy tropes and cliche's, is interesting enough, and while I never became bored with it, I don't feel that it is all that memorable.   The main character is supposed to come off as a cool and care-free badass, with cheesy one-liners included, which almost directly conflicts with the story, and makes him completely one-dimensional.  Combat is simple as you only have two attacks; melee and magic, and your magic is based off of whatever your melee weapon happens to be at the time. Melee will be your main form of attack, but each weapon uses the same animations, no matter what style weapon it may be. The animation is fine for a sword, but it looks silly with anything that isn't a sword. It just looks weird when Andronikos is bashing the enemies with the handle side of the scythe. Magic, on the other hand, is ranged and very powerful, especially with some of the later weapons. You can charge the magic to do a more powerful attack, each charge attack is different, and the effects accompanying them are nice. While your magic meter runs out somewhat quickly if you spam the attack, your mana is easily recovered by simply standing near a mana fountain. However, the combat is too simple; each enemy is either affected by hitstun, knockback, or must pause for a moment to line up their attacks, and almost every fight plays out the exact same, no matter what enemy you're fighting: poke the enemy with a melee attack, run a circle, poke, run, poke. This strategy works on most of the bosses as well.   Controls are responsive and simple; they could easily be translated to an NES controller, as you only ever move around and have two buttons to worry about, melee and magic. On that note, you'll want to play with a joystick; I used a 3rd party (Rockcandy by PDP) Xbox 360 controller, as I found mouse and keyboard controls to be clunky, because all movement is assigned to WASD. There is the option to change the movement to different keys, but a point and click option similar to Diablo (which this game tries model itself after) would be nice. However, with a joystick, you have no menu control. You can pause the game, but you're still required to use a mouse to navigate the menus or use your equipped potion or item. I played on a touch screen monitor, so this wasn't as big of an issue for me, but it's still annoying and wasteful to drop one hand off the controller to do anything. You can switch melee weapons mid-fight, but you need to click on the icon with a mouse to do so, as there is no way to map these options to a joystick. It would be nice to have this option assigned to a face button, or even SELECT/BACK. But you won't want to use a keyboard as the game plays so much smoother with a joystick. It's an annoying and detrimental Catch 22.  The art style and graphics are well-done, but the Avenged Sevenfold logo of the Deathbat is EVERYWHERE. I know this is their game and all, but it's just too much. However, each level design is different, unique, and very well paced. All the levels with the exception of the starting area and world hub are based off of a song, and that song has been remixed to fit a neo-classical Castlevania style. More on that in a bit. There's plenty to find and do in each level, and while veteran adventure gamers won't find any of this to be completely new, I always wanted to explore every bit of it to find the games many different collectibles. But there are some parts where your path is obscured because of the environment, and these areas are very frustrating if there happens to be an enemy hiding where you can see. I hardly felt like my deaths were unfair or cheap while fighting an enemy, but a few of the many traps and obstacles contained within each level did. (I'm looking at you, falling rocks and rolling spike barrels.)  The soundtrack is very solid, but those who aren't a fan of Avenged Sevenfold's music probably won't find much to enjoy. Every level theme is a remix of one of A7x's songs, many to the point that it's almost a new song entirely. As I mentioned earlier, the songs are redone to fit a game, and they're done very well. They never become annoying or repetitive, and are almost nostalgic for those who enjoyed Castlevania. That being said, the music for the level bosses is whatever song the level is themed after, minus the vocals. The level bosses always have a little introduction with The Wicked End's interlude and bridge, followed by the level's theme for the fight. The mini-bosses are where I ran into a problem. The music behind every miniboss fight is always Unholy Confessions, and while I enjoy the song on its own, it quickly became repetitive the more I played, as every level has at least two mini-bosses.  Enemies and bosses are plentiful, and there are unique mobs for every level, which make for a good variety of things to fight. Each enemy and each level lasts just long enough to enjoy, without ever feeling like they've overstayed their welcome. While the strategy to fight them never varies much, they're still enjoyable thanks to the different way each of them attacks. Once you learn the pattern though, each fight plays out the same way I mentioned above: poke, run, poke, and run. I didn't notice much variety to the mini-bosses, as it seems there are only two varieties: One that summons a bunch of adds and attacks directly, or one that puts up a shield, summons a bunch of adds you must defeat to lower the shield, and then attacks directly. You'll know when you find a mini-boss area, too. It's always in a large, empyty clearing that you can't walk out of once you enter, thanks to a barrier that erects behind you as you enter. Fortunately, each level boss is challenging and very unique, and each one must be fought in a new way.  I hardly encountered any glitches or hiccups, except for one almost game-breaking glitch during the level, Babylon. I exited the game mid-fight against the first mini boss to return to The Crypt to buy some health potions, and upon my return found that the barrier that erects for each mini-boss fight had not disappered. I could not re-enter the arena to fight the mini-boss, therefore could not complete the level. I tried exiting and re-entering the game multiple times, and eventually had to lose all of the lives I had so the level would reset, and I could continue.   All in all, for a game ported from a mobile platform to play on PC, Hail to the King: Deathbat is a decent first game from Avenged Sevenfold. Avenged sevenfold fans will enjoy the soundtrack and art, and adventure fans will enjoy the gameplay. I can honestly say I'd buy a sequel if they were to ever make one. It gets a solid 6.5-7/10, and if the above issues with the controls, environment, and combat were addressed, the game would easily be an 8/10. Being a fan of Avenged Sevenfold will make or break the experince, but if you're indifferent about the band behind it, this could be a good budget adventure game for you.",

Which means this game was just a lazy PC port. (The game shuts down when you press ESC. That's usually not a good sign. This usually means the developers or the port teams know not much about PC gaming.)  Also, that thing you can do on your handheld counterpart of this game where you can choose to play as A7X member character is all but gone on this PC port. (HUGE ♥♥♥♥ING BUMMER)  It's still a good game. Just don't get it on PC. Get it on your phones. I have bought both copies, and I plan to just stick to the version on my Android phone.",
