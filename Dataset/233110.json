            "review_text": "Almost cool... but sadly, no. I have attempted 3 times to write a review that didn't sound like me just ranting about the seemingly random level design with dumb pre-determined placements that you can't move or control, the silliness of the AI that has creeps ignoring clear paths to go through barriers for no reason that I can discern, or the crazy difficulty ramp that has you crushing hordes of weak enemies until suddenly a wave appears that is so strong all of your defenses together manage to almost deplete the shield on a single creep. I can't seem to keep myself from ranting, see? It's fun for a while, but around level 10 it's just blah, more of the same, and not worth the frustration of spending 20 minutes carefully pruning all the possible paths down to a manageable few, only to have a sudden wave of ridiculously overpowered creeps saunter in and kill you without any possibility of winning. Worth it if you get it for really cheap, but only as a temporary diversion.   Hope the second one is better, especially for the price they're asking for it.",

            "review_text": "It just doesn't have a hook. While 'Technica' is in the title, there's not a whole lot of 'technical' to the game. I can appreciate lack of MM (some TD games are designed this way), but it's usually supplemented with the option to do so or having MM applied during a paused wave - this has neither.  It's a very basic TD game, with a standard rock-beats-paper-beats(etc) format.  And while I understand there are always similarities between games, if you're going to LOOK like Defense Grid, don't have 'Defense' in your title. Ridiculous.  Play DG2 or Gemcraft 2: Chasing Shadows if you want modern TD. This ain't it.",
