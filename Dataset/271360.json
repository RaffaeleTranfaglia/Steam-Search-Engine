            "review_text": "Its an overall good buisness game, reminds me of Transport Tycoon and Capitalism Plus. The game is slightly basic and gave me a couple of good hours of entertainment.  I like how I can influence growth of a city and the transport network I can chose to make a depot hub or direct lines of transport.  If I could change some aspects of the game I would want to impliment a stock system  and more advanced production chain. ie, If I produced wood boards, I would gain saw grains as a bi product instead of one building, one product.

            "review_text": "Although it's advertised to work on Windows 7, 8 and 10, some people have problems with this game. There are a couple of fixes mentioned on the forum that seem to work for most people, but be aware that you'll probably have to spend 5 or 10 minutes getting the game to work, as I had to do as well. This is an old game after all (released 2002), and wasn't developed to be compatible with our modern hardware.  The game itself is what I consider somewhat of a classic. Even though the Jowood games catalogue consists of relatively obscure titles like Traffic Giant, Transport Giant, and Hotel Giant, I think they have made some of the greatest classic tycoon-genre games ever made (apart from the *real* classics of course - you know which ones I mean).   IG2 combines goods transportation (similar to their other game Transport Giant) with industry and production management, and the result is a pretty fun game that, even though it shows its age in a number of places, will keep fans of the genre entertained for a decent amount of time.  To me it's worth its current discounted price (12€), to get to play a more or less 'fixed up' version of a game that I used to play a lot of. Without the nostalgia I would probably find it just a bit overpriced, especially the full price (15€) I think is pushing it for an old game like this. But it's definitely still a fun game, no matter how old it is.",

            "review_text": "I am pretty sure I have never posted a review on here but felt compelled to do so for this game. I have loved this game ever since it came out 13 years ago and was really disappointed when even with all the online fixes, patches and workarounds I could find, I could not get it to work on my new pc or laptop.   I emailed the devs last year who said they were working on a version that would work with modern day computer's and their operating systems, but did not see anything further.   Then yesterday I see it drop on steam and immediately by it whilst it was on sale at £8 and I was upset to learn it still wouldn't work. Read some forums and tried a few workarounds including various different compatibility modes, but no dice.  I shut down my pc and rebooted and just as I was about to send an email to the devs, venting my frustration and requesting assistance or an eta on a fix, I decided to boot the game again (with no compatibility modes turned on), so that I could get the error code and Boom, worked first time and worked flawlessly all evening last night.  So to all who buy this game wanting it to work, try the workarounds, shut down and reboot your pc to try and make it work, you never know your luck. The fact it does work though on my PC which has an overlocked i7, GTX 780 ti, Windows 7 pro 64 bit, shows that there has been progress in making this game compatible with modern day PCS.  Unfortunately it does appear that its not universally working so yes its a risk, but if you played this game in the past and enjoyed it as much as I did, its worth the risk especially with the steam refund policy that now exists.",

Im on Win7 64bit with an ATI R9 270 and it loads just fine and at 1080!   WOOHOO!! :) _________________________________________________  Firstly, Do i recommend this game? well, ATM, I will say Yes! It looks great and while I have only done the tutorials and not put much time into it, it looks like it will be an awesome time sink! :)  Now, on to the part that nearly forced me to not recommend the game!  Along with may others, I had the crash issue as the game loads! Usually an instant thumb down!  BUT, For me the issue was fixed simply by finding the game .exe file (\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Industry Giant 2) and then setting the Compatibility Mode to Win Xp Sp3. By doing this the game loads just fine and it loads in 1080!! The only other Compatibilty mode it loaded for me was in Win95 but I couldnt change the resolution at all because it just crashed.  So, IF you have the game and it wont load, try what I posted and see if it works. A dev has said they are working on fixing the issue. I will update this review IF they fix it!",

It has issues with frame rates when choosing different color skins, UI is extremely small and difficult to navigate, no tutorial system, constant crashing, the list goes on.  I have to say I am extremely disappointed in this game. I had very high hopes for it; I read a lot of reviews months before hand with people saying it 'Its like Captialism 2!' Which I absolutely loved the ever loving poop out of Captialism 2! However, Industry Giant 2 is nothing but a let down and I am very upset at how poorly ported this game is for Modern PCs; it stood as my #2 on my wishlist for so long, only to find out it was a complete let down, and therefore I requested a refund.  Better luck next time, Fancy Bytes &amp; Reactor.",
