            "review_text": "tl;dr - Far inferior to the unreleased DOS version. I can only justify buying this to send a message that the west wants these games. It's up to you to decide if you want to spend $20 on a worse version of a game from 1993 - along with my hesitant recommendation, I recommend reading into the history of SoftEgg's attempt at bringing the game to the US if you're on the fence. I may not know how tl;dr works.  Like most of the other reviewers, I played the DOS version of this game a TON when I was growing up. I consider the story behind that version's failed release to be one of the greatest disappointments in video game history - look into it, if you feel so inclined. Had the release succeeded, we may well have seen official English releases for many more Gainax titles. Titles I have never played, and would sorely like to. The fact that this is actually getting an official release in western markets now, so long after the fact, is surprising. However, there is one thing that is preventing me from fully embacing this release: the translation.  As others have noted, the translation is vastly inferior to the unreleased DOS version. The opening text crawl, which you can see on the Store page, has some amazing Engrish (to be fair, nothing else in the game quite reaches that level). There are grammatical and spelling errors abound, and in a game that is largely text based it's pretty annoying. In addition, certain stats and skills now have names that don't really make sense. Charisma has become Glamour, Refinement has become Elegance, and neither of those are really troubling. But in a game where the religious symbolism is extremely western (crosses and nuns), why has 'Sin' become 'Karma?' It doesn't even make any sense. You actually GAIN karma for doing sinful things, and if I hadn't made the connection to the DOS version, I may have thought that was a good thing. Also, and this is admittedly a minor point, Conversation is now 'Speech.' The skill is basically tracking your daughter's ability to engage in witty conversation with people, so Conversation is far more appropriate. Speech sounds more like she's learning to speak properly... yet, the only way to increase it is by working at the Bar, and proper speech is actually governed by Decorum. It's silly.  It makes me sad that such an inferior version of the translation has seen a release that the DOS version never did. I yearn for the days of the original's nostalgic, pixelized art, though I'm willing to accept that that's more about my own nostalgia - the art isn't really bad. I think some of the art has altered your daughter's poses as she grows, but that may have something to do with blood type, and I've only played one game, so I can't definitively state that's the case.  Also, another minor point (not so minor?) - going full screen stretches the game's aspect ratio rather than retaining it via a border or something. It looks terrible, so play windowed. And why did my daughter stare lovingly at me and speak Japanese to me for 90 seconds upon completion of the game? There was no text in that segment, which if I recall from the DOS version, was a letter your daughter wrote to you thanking you for all you've done for her.  Honestly, I'm not sure if I want to recommend this. The unofficial DOS version is better in just about every way. I don't condone piracy at all, but it's hard to justify paying $20 for an inferior version of a game from the early 90s. I haven't looked into what the community is doing with this release - if smarter people than I are going to find a way to crack and fix this game, then buy it. I bought it solely because I want to send a message to the Japanese makers of games like these that there is a market for them in the west. They're fantastic and I want them.",

            "review_text": "Bed rid my daughter sending her to church too much. Sent her into the wilderness at the age of 10 with no armour or weapon and watched her get jumped by a condor. Gave her breast enlarging pills and a skimpy dress that I bought from some sort of east asian con man. Made her a lumberjack by day and grave keeper by night. And some how she has the nerve to appreciate my butler over her own father? 10/10 Gainax. Best daughter I'll never have.",

            "review_text": "Plan your daughter’s day simulator.   You choose what classes your daughter take, what jobs she does, and work to raise her stats. You have some other mini- games such as a simplified battle system you see when wandering the wilderness and there are set events that happen every playthrough. As a game it can be boring if you don’t enjoy stat raising as a main mechanic.  The biggest positive to this game is making your own story as you play. Do you raise a saint, a warrior, a housewife? Crafting your own story is where the fun is at and I find the game enjobable because of it. There is replay value in raising the character a different way, focusing on combat skills, domestic skills, and others.  Negatives There are many problems with the translation. There have not been instances that I couldn’t understand what it meant but it sounds very off. Nothing game breaking but still noteworthy. The end text for me at least scrolled too fast and I couldn’t see much though I think that got patched after my playthrough.  It’s an old game and it feels old. That said if you don’t mind that it is still a fun game.  The above-mentioned focus on raising stats may not be enjoyable for many  Conclusion.  I do like this game and think that people should give it a try as it is something different and has plenty of replay value with plenty of endings. Grab it on sale and give it a go if you are unsure. Watch a video and see if it interests you. I enjoy and recommend it.  ",

            "review_text": "I've spent a lot of time playing the original, and I can safely say that this is pretty much exactly the same. The only difference is the updated artwork. Personally, I would have loved an option to switch to the original sprites, since there is an option for midis.  The translation is slightly off in certain places, (no s on the end of some plurals) but it's barely noticeable.  I would have liked it if the game could have had the steam overlay and the ability to take screenshots.  Overall it's just as endearing and fun as I remember it, I'm really happy that Princess Maker 2 is on Steam.",

I encountered this game when I was 9 at my friend's house, who are not very close to me, but the game was just mind blowing so I never wanted to home.   PrincessMaker3 was the first game I ever purchased with my own money, and I was playing it on daily basis.  21century, the era of internet started and first thing i searched from internet was to get Princess Maker 2, the game of my generation.  me and my friends were so crazy about this game, we were only talking with lines of the game.  I have been playing this game regularly till now. ( I am in my 30's and a mother of a child)  I have laptop with window XP operating system only to play Princess Maker.  I purchased this game to just to show support and love to princess maker so producers will know this game still sells and might continue making the series..  EVERYONE in this universe should play this game to really understand life.  this is the best game of my generations and had huge impact on our generation's mentality. ",

Now, the game is finally available in English in the west.  My only gripe is that the original beta's translation was not used. The redone in-house translation is a tad bit rough in some places, with a few grammatical errors here and there. Other than that, it's everything I'd hoped for!",

            "review_text": "You play the part of a hero that was granted a child by the gods. A pure, innocent little girl who has been sheltered from the world in ways only the gods can shelter. Or at least, only the gods could get away with such treatment of a child. It comes across as being similar to keeping a newborn in the basement for the first ten years of her life, only interacting with her on a basic level and not allowing any contact with the world outside. Someone call heavenly child services!   You have to raise her from that tender age of ten, arranging for everything from her diet, to her clothes, to her education. Raising a child and giving her a good education isn't cheap, either. How can a single adoptive father, on a stipend from the kindgom of a meager 500 gold per year, afford it? On a normal diet, the girl eats 360 gold per year, and the other 140 isn't nearly enough for all the little things a child needs, or anything resembling an education. Well, the answer is obvious. Put her to work!   From the age of 10, your adoptive daughter can do work as a babysitter, watching over other children barely any younger than her and keeping them out of trouble. Or she could work on a farm, buiding up her strength and destroying her appearance. Or, for a penny a day, she could work at the church... she'll even get sundays off! Wait... what?   Doing jobs and taking classes will raise some of the girl's stats and lower others, and the fun of the game is all the different ways your daughter can turn out. A dancer! A painter! A poet! She can become loved by high society, and leave her mark on the world through her arts. Or... an Archmage! A Hero! She can learn to wield might and magic, and even challenge the very god of war in her adventures! Or... A hunter! A... concubine? The  demon queen ?!?! You can hopelessly corrupt your child, and offend the gods with how bad of a father you have been.  The game is an interesting take on the life simulation genre, and offers dozens of endings for great replayability. Highly recommended for those that like stat management/micro management games.",
