When I went to look up the rules etc. the links didn't seem to work.  Overall a really fun game. JUST ONE MORE TURN!   EDIT: The links work now and I can look up rules etc. Still overall UI/UX could use some work, but I'm having a lot of fun.",

I am positively surprised in feeling that this is a game I enjoy not only because of older memories but rather on its own merits.  Thanks for the super quick first batch of bug-hunting and fixing. Keep up the good work guys.",

PROS: -Looks nice -Simple to learn -Really cool art  CONS: -Horrible turn phase -Turns split into seasons, and you can only do anything in spring -Constant crashes -Buggy as hell -AI has information advantage -The only source of information you have is through espinage -You constantly find 1000 unit stacks in certain places (Which I think is involed with the AI using the Economic help mechanic) -Stupid combat mechanics -And again, buggy as hell  I'm so ♥♥♥♥ing done...",

Even beyond that the game is just more simplistic than I thought it would be. If I hadn't bought this on a web store I would have been refunding this on steam.  It's sad to think that someone backed the kickstarter for this at the $1000 level and two people at the $2500 level.",
