    "description": "Austen Translation is a tongue-in-cheek strategy game which borrows heavily from the visual novel tradition. It can be played solo against bots or as a hot-seat, party-game multiplayer match with up to five players. Randomly combined plot elements, settings, endings and rivals make each playthrough feel fresh.",
