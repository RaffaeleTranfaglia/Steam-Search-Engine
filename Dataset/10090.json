The gameplay is simply COD4 with a different era. Its fun, fast, and arcadie. The single player is alright with a couple of interesting characters. Nothing worth praising here but a lot of enjoyment is to be had from the campaing.  Multiplayer is still alive and active. The servers are very fun to play in and have a lot of active players on them. WaW's multiplayer is very fun and solid. It may have a couple of cheap moments like any other COD has. But it is still very enjoyable and can keep you entertained for a couple of hours.  As always I leave the best for last. Zombies! Call of Duty: World at War's zombie mode is one of the best co-op experiences I have ever had. Its fun, gameplay is solid, theres a story, and it will give you and your friends hours upon hours of entertainment. The game comes with 4 solid maps to play on. Natch Der Untoten, Verruckt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese. These maps offer great variety and are very fun to play in. Zombies is the biggest and most alive part of this game. With a community that has created thousands upon thousands of custom zombie maps that one can enjoy. Many map makers like ZCT and TMG provide high quality maps that can be compared to Treyarch's best.   You still reading eh? Go and buy this game NOW! Yeah thats right, NOW! This is a game everyone should have in their libraries as it offers many hours of entertainment. Like stated before this is the 2nd best Call of Duty to be made. I give this game a 9.5/10 as it truly deserves that score.",

            "review_text": " Arguably the best of the franchise and well populated. Brilliantly nostalgic and still an absolute joy to play. PunkBuster can be a problem however.   'Call of Duty' was and remains a franchise at the forefront of the online FPS genre. Dominating both console and PC alike, it's rivaled some would say, only by it's EA counterpart 'Battlefield'; but 'World at War' was something else. Released in 2008 it adapted and built perfectly on the foundations set the previous year by Activision's installment in the series - 'Modern Warfare'.  Trearch's addition gave us features the likes of which we'd never seen in 'Call of Duty 4'. Vehicles. Tanks. Though on face value a simple addtion, their inclusion was well implimented and appropriatley balanced. We were also graced with a slightly new approach to the killstreak system, seeing the introduction of attack dogs; along with a tweaked 'Create-A-Class' system made to feel more period accurate, with bolt action rifles becoming an entierly different weapon type paired with the ability to use their iron-sights, as apposed to being restricted to a telescopic sight.  In terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of WWII from both a Russian and American perspective; battling the Japanesse on Iwo Jima and beating down the 3rd Reich from Stalingrad to Berlin. Featuring the voice talents of Keifer Sutherland for the American Sgt. Roebuck, and Gary Oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails Russian sniper - Viktor Reznov. The campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. The singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other 'Call of Duty' game.   However, my one biggest fault with 'Call of Duty: World at War' is the unfortunate lack of PunkBuster support. The anti-cheat system which now seems abandoned and disused is still required to play some servers in online matchmaking. Needing some Google searching to find a download of the appropriate files to enable the system to work. Although once this is done, the game plays fine and without further fault.  Oh, and not to mention. Zombies.   Recommended?:  Yes.  Score:  9/10",

            "review_text": "In my opinion, this is a nearly perfect game. It has an ok story, but you will overlook that very quickly as the gameplay and atmosphere captures the horror of World War 2 flawlessly, in both plot lines. In the first plot line, you play as an American soldier battling the Japanese, trying to capture an island that is full of booby traps and relentless enemies. This is a very cool way to play, with close quarters combat and ambushes aplenty, making the gameplay very suspenseful. In the other plotline, you play as a Russian soldier, firstly trying desperately to survive during a massive German invasion of a Russian town, then four years later, in 1945, you enter Germany and Berlin and brutally crush the German empire in what is a very satisfying set of levels. The first mission where you play as the Russian soldier is absolutely groundbreaking, filled with suspense and a dark, powerful atmosphere as you try to escape from the overkill that are the Nazis. Gameplay is your average Call of Duty game, it's fun and addictive, but on harder difficulty modes, it is extremely frustrating. Even on the easiest difficulty, you can bet that enemies will throw 3 grenades all aimed at you with no time to react. The Campaign is very entertaining and while short it has plenty of powerful moments, ESPECIALLY the ending, that was one of the best moments in a game, ever. The game looks absolutely beautiful, for a person that has to run PayDay 2 on lowest settings windowed to get 30 FPS it looks fantastic, even on lowest settings. The music is stunning, even right when you start the game you hear a track that grabs you into the game. Sadly, Campaign Co-op is dead and no-one plays it, so be sure to get friends if you want to play the Campaign with someone. Multiplayer is very good. On the XBox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, it is notorious for everyone to hack and spoil the game. Oddly, on the PC version, where it is far easier to cheat, you barely see any cheaters. In general, Multiplayer is very well alive and still has a lot of players to this very day, which is good, because multiplayer is very entertaining and amusing to playthrough online. Last, but certainly not least, the arcade-style Nazi Zombies mode. This is one of the best modes ever to be added to a video game, and would you believe it was added last minute? While the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops is flawless and (for some extra money) contains all the WaW maps remastered, it's still incredibly fun, and if you ask a friend to play Zombies with you, they usually accept. Overall, this is an excellent game and one that should definitely be in your Steam library. Just, don't get it full price, for this old of a game paying £20 is just plain stupid.",

The campaign is engaging and replayable, the multiplayer is fun and enjoyable, and the zombies mode that was introduced from this game that is still in the newer Treyarch titles is a fun game to play with friends.  Pros- [Campaign]- Good story and characters, engages you, challenges you, and is only the lead into the stories of BO1 and 2. [MP]- People still play this almost 9 year old game. [MP]- Guns are varying, meaning you aren't going to get killed by one gun and one only (but beware of PPsh users) [ZM]- Simple and easy to learn. [ZM]- Fun for co-op or online. [ZM]- Custom zombies. [Campaign]- This is a personal opinion, but this game is gorey-er than other COD campaigns, and I think it impoves immersion  Cons- [Campaign]- Although I said its challenging, sometimes it's too much so. [Campaign]- The Pacific Theatre gets boring towards the end, and you almost want it to end there. [MP]- Juggernaut. Enough said. [MP]- Anymore, most servers are not vanilla, meaning it will probably be modded in some way. [ZM]- It gets repetitive after a while, due to simplicity.  Final Verdict- Campaign- 8.75/10. It's good, but not amazing. Multiplayer- 9/10. Probably the best multiplayer in a COD game. Zombies- 9.5/10. The second best Zombies mode so far, only behind Black Ops 1. Overall [Average of all scores]- 9.11/10. My favorite COD, and to many others one of the best in the series.",

The multiplayer is amazing in pretty much every sense, with an unconventional design for  Call of Duty 's standards. This was the one in the series that started zombies as well, and while  Nacht Der Untoten  isn't a highlight of the game mode it is raw and hardcore, and  Der Riese  is outstanding especially with friends. Filled with mysteries. The mode also gave birth to the marvelous soundtrack provided by  Kevin Sherwood  &amp;  Elena Siegman.   Treyarch  did a fine job with this one.  8.1/10.0 ",

I can't say much for multiplayer or campaign aspects of this game, but the zombies and modded zombies are truly extensive and amazing. I think the greatest thing about a lot of the custom zombies maps is that they have an end other than the death of the player(s). All in all it's a game well worth the buy, but if you don't have much money just wait for a sale (Steam has a lot of those... LOL). If you are a Call of Duty gun nerd then this is certainly a good pick because the maps have guns from every Call of Duty ever. From the good ol' not-so-classics like MW3 to the new games like AW and BO3, you name them, they're there. Also the maps have a number of themes from holiday's to movies, even original ideas. Easter eggs are a large part of the good maps nowadays, you'd be unlucky to find a good map without a zombies gun game mode too! Definitley recommend this game to anyone and everyone above the age of 12.",

It was released on November 11, 2008 in North America and on November 14, 2008 in Europe. It was announced on December 2, 2007, and on June 6, 2008; the 64th anniversary of D-Day, Treyarch announced it would be named as 'World at War' and it would take place in the Pacific theater of war as well as the Eastern Front.  There is one campaign in the game divided into two: the American campaign and the Soviet campaign. The Soviet campaign is returning after having last been present in Call of Duty 2. There is no British campaign in the game, making World at War the only major Call of Duty set in the Second World War not to feature a British Campaign or a British playable character. It features both a solo and co-op campaign, however both are the same except that co-op is played with multiple people and certain missions are absoloutly unplayable.  The American campaign is set in the Pacific theater on the islands of Makin, Peleliu, and Okinawa. The Soviet campaign is set in the Eastern Front, mainly in Nazi Germany. In the American campaign, players take the role of Pvt. C. Miller as he fights alongside Sgt. Tom Sullivan, Cpl. Roebuck (later Sergeant), and Pvt. Polonsky. In the Soviet campaign, players take the role of Pvt. Dimitri Petrenko as he fights alongside the merciless Sgt. Viktor Reznov and the merciful Pvt. Chernov. In the American campaign, players, for the first time in a Call of Duty game, fight against the Japanese Imperial Army. Most combat takes place in jungles, where ambushes are likely. Combat also takes place in small mortar pits, ridges, beach heads, Japanese trenches, and small villages. Bunkers are a common sight in the American campaign, usually causing heavy casualties. In the Soviet Campaign, players fight against the German Wehrmacht during the push towards Berlin. Combat takes place, at first, in the ruins of Stalingrad where the player is mainly a sniper. After that, combat occurs in farmland and forests of the German town of Seelow, and finally Berlin is assaulted and close quarter fighting becomes a common feature. The last mission of the Soviet campaign sees the Red Army capture the Reichstag and the player planting the Soviet Flag on top of the building.",

The campaign was so fun to play, in one campaign level you get to drive around in a tank and blow up stuff. Who doesn't love blowing stuff up while driving around in a tank?? The best part about the campaign is that one of the characters, Viktor Reznov is played by Gary Oldman who he's a famous actor in many films such as the Dark Knight or Harry Potter.  I tried custom zombies, i see that most custom zombie maps are poorly made (don't ask me to play custom zombies with you.)  Overall I like this game, the only call of duty game that is the best, second being the modern warfare trilogy.",

Multiplayer is quite fun, however i would recommend Zombies (Co-op)  Zombies, is amazing. With 4 maps to choose from you have lots of options, as well as thousands of maps which can be downloaded from sites like UDX or zombiemodding. It takes about 5 minutes to learn how to do and is WELL worth it. Modded maps often include custom perks, guns from other call of duty's (Black ops 2, Modern Warfare series), and unbeleiveable textures. I have several maps taking place at a plumbers castle (Mario Series) and some at a mexican themed resturaunt (Taco Bell).  I hope my review helped you decide whether or not to buy this amazing game.",

Multiplayer followed the footsteps of Call of Duty 4. This created a fairly balanced multiplayer experience while still giving the player to customize their loadout. This is before custom killstreaks were introduced, which, in my opinion, was the beginning of the end for Call of Duty. It used the 3, 5, 7 killstreak pattern, which was extremely balanced.  This was the first Call of Duty to have zombies. This is where this game really shines. The zombie mode is easily the best part about this game. It offers hours upon hours of enjoyment, not to mention on the PC version you can download countless custom maps. This was the sole reason I purchased this game on PC even though I already owned and enjoyed it on my Xbox 360.  This game gets a solid 8.5/10.

Also, this game doesn't really need 256 MB VRAM, as I can play the Zombies maps on 128. However, the campaign certainly needs it in some spots.   Pros: -ZOMBIES -Custom zombies -Nostalgia -Only 20 bucks -Relatively low system requirements  Cons: -Games are a little glitchy (E.g. instadown in zombies, not getting downed when you should in zombies) -Crashes when you try to change resolution and some other graphics settings (Just have to modify config file) -Hackers in multiplayer -Lose Jug when hit with Wunderwaffe (Minor complaint)  Note that there are soooo many more pros, but those were the only cons I could think of at the time of posting this.",

            "review_text": "Call of Duty: World at War is a 2008, historical first-person shooter that takes place in the Pacific Front between the United States and Japan, including the Eastern Front between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Developed by Treyarch and published by Activision, the game takes a different approach than previous Call of Duty titles as the presentation takes a gritty look into the world conflict. The dark overtone, gore, and the true nature of warfare is presented. Does Call of Duty: World at War has your attention?  As mentioned earlier, World at War takes a gritty look into World War II than its predecessors. The atmosphere is grim and depressing as you fight your way to Berlin as Private Dimitri Petrenko or as Private Miller hearing the scream of Japanese soldiers charging your positions or the death sirens of burning men. The presentation is outstanding and the game takes inspiration from mature war documentaries (actual combat footage from the Pacific and Eastern Front) or recent war films from the 1990s to the present time. The game does not restrict the nature of warfare. The graphics is pretty solid, even for the game that came out in 2008. Besides the graphics and presentation, the sound effects are actually impressive, ranging from the M1 Garand “ping” sound, the M1919 Browning machine gun, the German FG42, the Japanese Type 99 LMG, and many other weaponries. Kudos to Treyarch for the sound effects. The voice acting from Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman are solid and memorable. Lastly, the campaign was good, even great with intense moments from the Soviet and American campaigns.   While World at War has many, outstanding attributes, there are some negative factors that must be taken into consideration. First, the Veteran (hardest) difficulty is a joke. Grenade spamming from enemy AI, unlimited enemy spawn, and lack of a legitimate challenge is a disaster for the Veteran difficulty level. The only way possible to end unlimited enemy spawning is to move forward (and do not stop). The infamous, Heart of the Reich level was a lot of stress when you have to destroy the 4 Flak88 guns while being grenade spammed, dodging enemy AI fire, and healing yourself. Unfortunately, Treyarch was unable to balance out the Veteran difficulty into an actual difficulty challenge without feeling cheated or cop-out. Some of the weapon modeling in the game feels odd and looks weird, particularly the Japanese Arisaka bolt-action rifles, the Thompson, and the pistols from all factions. While this factor might consider as a “neutral” factor, I also noticed a notable amount of over-the-top explosions, cinematic moments in the game when shooting at Japanese boats and ships or buildings. Admittedly, I find the explosions a bit excessive, leaning more into Michael Bay territory but this is based upon personal taste. Lastly, the sale price is a bitter disappointment from Activision. I already mentioned this on my (original) Call of Duty review, but this has to be addressed again.   Call of Duty: World at War was released the year after Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The game fell under MW’s shadow and many gamers were favoring more on present time military setting than World War II or historical shooters. World at War was considered as one of the last World War II titles in the 7th generation of video game consoles (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii generation) and this was before the long drought on no historical first-person shooters until the recent revival and interest of World War II (and historical) games in 2014/2015. I didn’t play much of the Nazi zombies cooperative multiplayer, but the impressions were pretty good in the PC version, especially with the mods.   Call of Duty: World at War is, arguably, the last historical shooter for the franchise, and probably the last, great Call of Duty game before the franchise lost its original identity (starting from Ghosts). World at War has my highest recommendation for its gritty, historical presentation, moderate replay value in the single player campaign, and Nazi zombie cooperative multiplayer for the hardcore audience.",

            "review_text": "Call of Duty: World at War Review  After the success of Call of Duty Modern Warfare; which brought the whole first person shooter genre into modern day settings, infinity ward was slated to make a sequel. In the meantime, Treyarch was tasked to fill in for a year. How does one go about following up to Modern Warfare, arguably one of the best in the series? They didn’t go modern or push forward in time to the future, but instead went back in time once more to revisit World War Two. At first it would appear to be a huge step back, however it was the opposite. Treyarch made the right decision not to follow the same path as previous WWII entries by having the American campaign set during the invasion of Normandy. I mean how many times can you storm Omaha, seriously?! Instead the American campaign see’s the player fight in the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa on the Japanese front. The character is again a silent private who just takes orders without question, and is led by sergeant Roebuck who is voiced by none other than Jack Bauer himself: Keifer Sutherland. Running off of the same engine as Modern Warfare, the graphics still look crisp and new. If you have a decent rig you can turn off v-sync and run the game at 90 frames-per-second.  The American’s aren’t the only ones you play as, the total badass Russians also have a campaign starting in Stalingrad, and ending in Berlin with the taking of the Reichstag. The campaign jumps from the American to Russian campaign with great frequency to mix up the setting. The Russian campaign culminates in some epic moments which might not have felt the same if it hadn’t started with the battle of Stalingrad, even though at first the battle of Stalingrad may not seem original. Starting in Stalingrad the player experiences the struggle to regain the motherland from the clutches of Germany and then takes the fight to them. The final level of the game gives the player some of the best Call of Duty blockbuster moments, where you are just awash with the waters of victory coursing through you. In other words, you do some very cool things which I will not mention for the sake of avoiding spoilers. Yes again the Russian character is a generic silent private led by a Sergeant Reznov, who is your typical portrayal of a Russian Commander-in-chief.  The gun play and cover system is rock solid as usual, giving the player some nice snappy shooting with the ability to peek out of cover around corners. You can cook grenades and toss enemy grenades back at them. World at War pretty much follows all the common tropes of a cinematic Call of Duty game. The campaign can be played solo or co-op. World at War was really important because it introduced the now iconic solo/co-op game mode: Nazi Zombies. This was probably the biggest advancement to the Call of Duty series at the time. Nazi Zombies provides the player with extra hours of fun on a few different maps. The point of Nazi Zombies is to see how many waves of vile Nazi Zombies you can survive. This is definitely a game mode that you’ll get more out of with some friends. You start off with a pistol and some money which can be used to unlock weapons. The weapons are purchased by going up to the outlines of guns hanging on the walls and pressing the action button to acquire them. You can go back to previously purchased guns to obtain ammo by using the in game money of course. Now there’s the matter of obtaining money. Around the map you will find boarded up windows and doors with slits to shoot through. When a zombie reaches one of these barriers it will begin to remove it board by board and once all the boards are removed will enter the player’s “safe zone”. You can replace the boards by going up to the opening and holding down the action button. Rebuilding barriers nets the player some cash, two hundred dollars a board to be precise. To successfully survive, be sure to constantly rebuild the barriers and remain calm and patient, scoring headshots on the nasty’s. I believe every Treyarch Call of Duty following this one included Nazi Zombies mode, that’s how successful it was. In addition to the stellar campaign and the frightfully fun Nazi Zombies is of course your standard fiesta of multiplayer modes. The game also has an emotional and tonally correct soundtrack, fusing an orchestra and choir with some electronic and metal sounds. Written by Sean Murray, it packs a real punch and lifts the whole single player experience even higher. My personal favourites all come from the Russian campaign.   Ultimately this was an exceptional and important entry in the series. The thing that impressed me the most about Call of Duty: World at War was the fact that they had the conviction to go back to WWII after Call of Duty 4. They went back and they made one the best and most influential entries in the series next to 4. Some may say the original or Call of Duty 4 is the best, but my personal favourite is Call of Duty: Black Ops.  8.5/10",

It has an intense understanding of warfare thus unlike any other FPS it gives the players more than a regular opportunity just to match a crosshair with the enemy in front of you. Rather you feel a whole battlefield with a realistic weaponry.   Campaign is especially good considering that it tells the story of fronts that has been mentioned less so far, than the other fronts of WWII. It is not very difficult to play, like most of the CoD games, however Veteran difficulty could be tried for a fun challange. Also, you have the opportunity to play in competitive Co-op mode up to 4 players . Other than that there is of course the zombie mode which is the very beginning of the whole series. Map numbers are limited and so are the possibilities but I think it is a must for every dedicated player. Multiplayer is realistic and although perks, attachments and weapons are of great use and advantage for a player, higher levels of others is not a crucial concern for a beginner. The game depends on the talent and caution of a player mostly as well as gameplay experience but not definitely on their level.  In overall, I can say that this game is a must for a CoD player, a nice and slighlty different experience for an FPS player and a good place to start for the inexperienced action gamers.",

            "review_text": "Unlike most Call of Duties and other first person shooters, World at War truly shows what war looks like. If someone is hit by a powerful enough weapon (Such as a machinegun or a high-calibre sniper rifle), a limb or even their head could come off. People are also burned alive by molotovs and flamethrowers. For the hardcore war gamers who don't mind seeing a bit of gore, this is a realistic improvement. For the gamers who don't want to see this, luckily there is a filter you can change in the options, which will cancel out the limb loss &amp; decapitation, it will also scale down the blood a little.  Even without the gore, I still think this game can show you a good glimpse of what war is truly like; Desperate banzai charges, frightening swamp ambushes, deadly tree snipers and brutal machinegun nests are all throughout this dark game. There are two campaigns that neatly show two perspectives of the war: In the American campaign, you are Private Miller in the US Marines, and you fight the brutal Imperial Japanese who will use whatever horrible tactics are available to kill you and your friends. Even if you surrender, they will still execute you. As the American campaign progresses, the atmosphere and morale of the soldiers goes down very badly.  In the Russian campaign, you are Private Petrenko, a conscript in the Red Army, and you fight Nazi Germany's evil Wehrmacht. Instead of a war of struggle, the Russian campaign is more a war of revenge, as you and the raging Red Army soldiers mercilessly and brutally slaughter the German forces, avenging the atrocities the Wehrmacht committed in their Motherland. But you can either choose to show mercy to the Germans, or kill them in however way you wish, but be warned: That doesn't mean your comrades won't kill them, and they usually do.  In my personal opinion, I believe these two epic campaigns are equally as good.  Obviously, no first person shooter or Call of Duty is realistic when it comes to combat, however I don't know how Treyarch did it, but they captured the emotional experience of a war nearly perfectly. I wouldn't be surprised if they had someone in who'd been through war. They got it nearly perfectly: The anger, vengefulness, the fear, terror, everything. How soldiers miss home and reflect on those good old memories before that awful, unfair and terrible thing happened.  All of these things are stuff you'd go through if you were in a war. On a semi-related note, I'd just like to say that I hope, that one day, all war ends, and no one has to go through such an evil, horrible, dark and terrifying experience, ever again. Let games like this remind people why war is a bad thing, because it's not all glory, shooting and fun, trust me.",

As it stands, the edge of the indicator is almost the same as the edge of a grenade's fatal radius, which means that almost as soon as the indicator appears on screen, you're in mortal danger. You'll just be walking around and then BOOM restart. This leads to a lot of frustrating and unfair deaths, even on the normal difficulty level (so much moreso on veteran). The window of time to press V for melee counterattacks is also painfully short. 90% of the time you die, it will be from one of those two things. Sometimes it will even be a combo! As you're on the ground fending off a melee attack, you'd better hope no grenades land at your feet, which happens so, so often.  This game also still doesn't understand player progression. Sitting behind cover and playing whack-a-mole doesn't work because of the infinitely respawning enemies. Killing some and then advancing often doesn't work because the rate of respawn is so high. The best strategy is often to just keep sprinting from cover to cover, avoid shooting anybody, and let your teammates advance, which is what the game seems to want you to do.  Play the campaign on normal, and you can have a fun few hours. Compared to Modern Warfare 1, it's faster-paced and has a nice arcade feel to it. The production is nice for a game of its time. There are a lot of loud noises. The Pacific levels are beautiful. There's a cool part shooting down kamikazes while rescuing sailors from the water. Kiefer Sutherland.

Great visuals and an awesome story (in terms of Call of Duty stories that is) Multiplayer is a huge success and brings hours and hours of enjoyment with the usual prestige system they've got going.  Overall this was one of my more favoured COD experienced.  I'd give this game a 8/10 I'll just urge you all not to bother buying it anymore as the playerbase is basically nothing.",

Considered by most people who used to play call of duty a lot to be one of the last great games in the series before it turned into simply awful updated versions every year for good reason.  Custom zombies is pretty much the best thing about the PC version, who needs Black Ops zombie maps when there are lots of remakes of the maps out there for WaW, and maps like Leviathan that completely bring the Black Ops zombie experience to World at War?  All the multiplayer maps and zombie maps that would otherwise have been DLC on the console versions, are free on the Steam version.  Multiplayer even after over 8 years since the game's original release, and unlike the console version still maintains a strong community, mostly comprised of modded lobbies but still an alive functioning multiplayer community.  Multiplayer community has little to no 'squeakers' we have come to know throughout the years of Call of Duty, World at War being an old game is long since abandoned by the masses of children that flock to Black Ops 3 and Advanced Warfare because of their shiny new graphics.  Campaign throws you into the first person control of two Allied soldiers, US Marine C. Miller, and Private Dimitri Petrenko of the 3rd Shock Army, taking you deep into the forests of Peleliu Island, the urban labyrinth of Berlin from the ruins of Stalingrad and the ruthlessness of a japanese outpost.  Historical accuracy is alright if you're OCD about that thing, there isn't too much historical inaccuracy in the game and it is not enough to put you off.",

            "review_text": "I'm reviewing solely the campaign portion of World at War, since that's what I got the game for and all that I've played.  Years after enjoying World War II shooters like Medal of Honor: Frontline and Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, I wanted something of the same mold. After asking people and reading reviews, I believed that World at War would have the best campaign yet.  I would be disappointed.   From beginning to end, World at War lacks intensity, persuasiveness, and engagement. The game places you onto tracks upon which you complete missions by going through a series of checkpoints. The campaign rushes through the war to put most of its focus on the last months before the Third Reich surrendered, so the momentum’s on your side from the start and nothing you and your squad do actually matters. You play a Russian and American soldier alternatively, who both get undue amounts of recognition by their squad leaders while remaining privates throughout their careers. Insufficient effort is made to make either character feel like your own; instead, you’re seeing their experiences in first person. Treyarch apparently intended to portray common soldiers as unrecognized heroes, and the game developer did an admirable job at that. But besides engendering respect, nearly every other aspect of the game falls short of what even predecessors had.  Whereas in Frontline, many of your missions were done alone and getting to work with teammates was a treat, here, you are always fighting with comrades. There is no infiltrating a village or mansion alone, or completing a mission by modulating your pace and playing style. Instead, you go down hallways and courtyards with your squad, occasionally getting to choose whether to take the right, left, or center path to kill the enemies your allies may take out anyway if you let them. Unlike Big Red One, formerly intimidating trenches are just places to rush in and out as you proceed to your next objective, which will be no more interesting to complete than the last one.  During each mission, I hoped that the game would finally become fun, but by the time around ten hours had elapsed, the campaign was complete with few instances worth remembering, and those few were times when I’d all but ignored my squad to assault the enemies alone for brief action-packed moments before getting killed.  One the whole, the World at War formula’s something like this: Wait to get ambushed. Pick up that weapon. Kill those guys (if you can, before your too-ballsy-to-live squadmates rush out and get themselves killed, not that it matters). Move to the next point. Rinse and repeat. If World at War’s placed in a nutshell, it won’t want for room.",

            "review_text": "World War II (WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War (after the recent Great War), was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, though related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of 'total war', the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (during which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (during which approximately one million people were killed, including the use of two nuclear weapons in combat), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.   The Empire of Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific and was already at war with the Republic of China in 1937, but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939[6] with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. Following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, including Poland, Finland and the Baltic states. The United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth were the only Allied forces continuing the fight against the Axis, with campaigns in North Africa and the Horn of Africa as well as the long-running Battle of the Atlantic. In June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the largest land theatre of war in history, which trapped the major part of the Axis' military forces into a war of attrition. In December 1941, Japan attacked the United States and European territories in the Pacific Ocean, and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific.  The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway, near Hawaii, and Germany was defeated in North Africa and then, decisively, at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. In 1943, with a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasion of Italy which brought about Italian surrender, and Allied victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded France, while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in South Central China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands.  The war in Europe ended with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan and invasion of Manchuria, Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945. Thus ended the war in Asia, and the final destruction of the Axis bloc.  World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts. The victorious great powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France—became the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War, which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers waned, while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and to create a common identity.",

The US campaigns especially are ruined by the sheer amount of bloody grenades and a gameplay is just hours of reading the 'watch the grenade indicator' caption. The lack of a savegame feature means if you don't hit a checkpoint you are doomed to relive the same bit over and over and over and over again to find after the 350th attempt (so it seems) you are just about there and you guessed it - bloody grenade!

It has the BEST campaign out of any Call of Duty game. It is a campaign you will play for fun, not to say you beat it. The multiplayer is also really fun, with many perks and guns to keep it feeling fresh. Lastly, there is the Nazi Zombies mode. Four maps bundled with the game, all 4 of which are very fun solo and co-op. But here is the long-lasting appeal for it. CUSTOM. ZOMBIES. There are a bunch of custom maps that other users have made. Just download and install them. Very easy. A lot of them are very good. A lot are original content, and there are also a couple remakes. I have seen Kino Der Toten, and there is also Origins, but at the time it is a work in progress.  However, there are some downsides. It is an old game. The multiplayer community is dead. There are around 7 servers left, though they are full of veteran players. The Zombies community, in a sense, is dead as well. Wanna join a game of Zombies with randoms? Good luck. No servers are up. Your only option is with friends or to roll in solo.  In spite of the cons, Call of Duty: World at War is a great game, and I feel that everybody should pick it up.  SCORE: 92/100  CONCLUSION One of the best Call of Duty games, and is well worth it on PC. Just make sure you have friends with this game as well, because there is not really much of a community left on PC.",

The PC community is nice for world at war which surprised me to see a lack of crouch tatical servers, like which plagues black ops 1. A lot of the servers say cracked, which I assume just cancle checking if your client is valid much like how you would on a minecraft server.   All of the servers are going to be x5 or more xp. I would of prefered x1 but I know the servers are now community ran, and it is kinda nice at first leveling up feels great.   I would recomend just holding off on buying this until it is on sale. 15 dollars full price is a lot of money",

This was pure laziness on the part of the devolpers and whoever designed the sniper portion in vendetta for veteran should be dragged outback and beaten with a rusty chain, cause getting 2 consecutive headshots on some kraut with ♥♥♥♥ing magic lazer karabiner is a crock of ♥♥♥♥♥.  tl;dr get the game and play everything but the Singleplayer Veteran mode.",

But i'm recommending this game because is the Last World War 2 game from the Franchise. If you're new on Cod games, it is one of MUST PLAY on PC for me!. The game has every DLC, Everybody can get access on the code console, Custom maps, No squeaky kids on Multiplayer, no Youtubers, No clans, No Optic Gaming and No Faze Clan, Mods, Mods on Multiplayer and last Custom Zombies AND ZERO QUICKSCOPE!. But the contras is it doesn't have the Archievements that really supported on the PS3/X360 Consoles due the Cheat codes on the ingame CMD. It has better graphics than the Black Ops PS3 version for my opinion. My first Cod game was Call Of Duty 3 so i'm from the old generation. And i hope Treyarch could launch Cod3 someday.   Just buy the game and enjoy the Darkest World War 2 Experience!, And if you're getting bored check out the MODS! The mods keeps the game ALIVE!.",

If you are buying this for campaign, I suggest you get an Modern Warfare game or something. If you are buying for multiplayer, there is not much so don't get it for that. The biggest reason to get this game is for the CUSTOM ZOMBIES and ZOMBIES in general. Custom zombies is the bestin this game. I suggest going on YouTube and looking up a video on how to get CZ before you mess up your files and stuff. Hope I helped ya! If you have a CODgame that I have maybe we can play sometime... , but before you leave custom zombies is fun with friends and alone, but remember, CUSTOM ZOMBIES HAS A WAY TO INFECT YOUR PC!

Black Ops doesn't have a co-op mode. (Also, the story of WaW is canon to Black Ops. Just thought you should know.)  Multiplayer for World at War is better than the multiplayer in Black Ops because a dedicated server can have over 60 players. In Black Ops, dedicated servers can only have 18 people at most. Unlike the CoD games today, it also doesn't keep track of your K:D ratio.  Even Zombie Mode is just a LITTLE BIT better. There are many custom maps for Zombies and communities based on the interest of making and playing these maps. Black Ops doesn't have custom maps for Zombie Mode.

If you came here for the singleplayer, its pretty good. Still the same thing that you probably played on consoles, and I didn't notice any extra bugs when I played through it. Though the lack of achievements made some of the easter eggs a bit harder to notice (Saving Pvt. Ryan). I didn't play coop campaign, but it is there, as well as death cards.   If multiplayer was what interested you, I can't particularly reccomend this to you. Its more alive (or atleast easier to get into a match for) than on the console, but its still fairly empty. Most of the servers I found lagged a bit for me, but when I did manage to find a good match, it was pretty fun.   Overall, it is a definite buy if you really like zombies but wouldn't mind a campaign or some multiplayer. If you have a lot of friends with this game who you can organize matches with, its hard not to reccomend buying it.",

I think I love it because enemys will die in 1-4 shots rather than 1 shot - 3 mags like in the newer games.  This game had an increadable American Campaign with the trench warfare against the Japanese and mind blowing Russian Campaign when you are storming the Nazis in their cities. Zombies is increadable and different from Black Ops 1 and 2 zombies. Instead of sitting in your corner with your assualt rifle or light machine gun like in COD: Black Ops 1 and 2, you are constantly moving and buying new weapons as you run out of ammo in World at War's Nazi Zombies.  If I had to talk about any problems I had with the game it would be in some of the missions when you die you go back to a checkpoint (Each checkpoint is at the beggining of an objective or half way through) and some of the objectives last for around 10 to 20 minutes. This means you have to play for another 5 or 10 minutes to get to where you just were, instead of the smaller objectives where you go back 1 or 2 minutes.  But, overal it's a good game. I don't plan to play Multiplayer any time soon because I am told by friends that everybody is hacking.",

Many people hate it for reasons that I understand and respect but I think it is fantastic. Frankly I feel that this is the definitve World War II video game that I had always been wanting to play and when I played it for the first time, boy did it deliver. PC was actually not my first platform for this game though. Finals week the Spring of 2009, all I did with a group of friends was trade of studying and playing COOP Call of Duty. It was epic of truly epic proportions. But through all academic stress out, another truth came through. This was the WWII game I had been wanting to play ever since my parents let me buy Medal of Honor: Allied Assault so many years ago. It was intense, featured all the weapons I wanted to see, had a fun story that kept building, had tanks, frakin airplane gunner mission, and most especially featured the US Marines (Love the Army but I'm a US Marines guy through and through).  Yes it has its issues, but I see them as standard Call of Duty issues and nothing that unique or game changing. If you are familiar with Call of Duty you know what you're getting here. I think the negative vibe surrounding opinion about this game just comes down to bad timing. It came out during a time when people were just tired of WWII subject matter. Call of Duty Modern Warfare had come out and the world was ready for different material. Be that as it may though, this one is a gem and well worth the buy.",

I will say though, that in 2015, the multiplayer experience has hit the toilet unless you can find some friends to play with.  Campaign, in and of itself, is extremely difficult, requiring some of the most skill I have seen in a while. The story is great for a WWII shooter, and leads straight into the Black Ops saga, some of the greatest games in recent years.  Multiplayer, as I have already said, has somwhat hit the toilet. 99% of the servers still available require some sort of mod, and this goes for COOP Zombies as well.  Zombies, solo, on the other hand is amazing. Difficult, sure, but it always is and always will be, whether you are playing Nacht or SOE.",

It's also the PERFECT game to buy for cheap and get so sucked into it that you won't buy futuristic games.  I had it on PS3, but bought it again for PC because, 1) it's just that good, and 2) custom zombies. If they came out with a remastered version for next gen consoles, which they won't, because the Call of Duty people are just a bunch of chumps who only look into the future and not the past, I would buy it again.   To put it simply:   Currently 2nd best Call of Duty Campaign: 10/10 Multiplayer: 9/10 Zombies: 10/10 Zombies + Custom Maps: 13/10 Call of Duty people need to stop being chumps and make another COD like this   And finally, my favorite game in my library (if you can't tell from my hours played)",

I am not saying that BO3 is bad but I am saying that with the 'GobbleGum' make the game too easy, GobbleGum like 'Perkaholic' and 'Killing Time' are too overpowered in killing zombies in certian situations. Perkaholic is just another topic altogether.Perkaholic should be nerfed and be way more rare in 'Dr.Monty's Factory'.If you get this yellow gobblegum out of the machine you instantly become the clutch king of the game.'GobbleGum' are too op so I think that Treyarch did a good job by introducing this way later in the Call Of Duty series.RAWR have fun playing this amazing game.",

If you want to go deeper with that, I would recommend playing it for yourself.. You get all the DLCs that would be on console..  On PC, you can get mods. This is a big part of the game. Mods are really fun. I would recommend them but just make sure theyre from trusted websites..  From  zombiemodding.com  and  zommods.com  , you just download the mod you want,  open it and install it and go to WaW and youre ready.  This game is very enjoyable and I would recommend this to anyone that like FPS and zombies..  ",

It is a game with great graphics, great gameplay and a great story that shows the horrors of World War II. The campaign is simply one of the best of all COD 's and can be played by up to 4 players online. In that mode, you play as both Pvt. Miller (American) with his buddy Sgt. Roebuck, and Pvt. Petrenko (Russian) with the legend Victor Reznov !  Speaking now of Multiplayer, it's a great mode ! You can use killstreaks as in other COD 's, but you can also use Tank 's, wich makes the game a lot more fun and addictive. In my experiences with the multiplayer, i didn't find any hackers to be honest ! The multiplayer community is more active by the night so don't expect a lot of people playing in the morning or the afternoon .  About Zombies, it is one of the best things in the game ! The Custom Zombies makes the game more fun, with maps and guns created by the community, but also features classic maps as Natch Der Untoten and Der Riese .  Final Verdict : 10/10",
