            "review_text": "What's the first thing that comes to mind, when reviewing a video game? Well, for me, it has to be the visual world that captures the core of our imaginations. And with this little gem called Half-Life, it comes as no exception that this game continues to boggle the mind and leave gamers alike wondering. There is more heart, creativity and scientific ingenuity there is in this one title than there is in most series and is arguably Valve's greatest achievement. With over 50 game awards, it's a strong justification. Half-Life isn't just one of the greatest FPS' games of all time. Half-Life isn't literally one of the best purchases you can ever get on Steam. Half-Life is quite simply, one of the greatest games ever made.  When compared to certain FPS' games in the past and todays time, which both heavily rely on long-winded cutscenes to present the main narrative of the game, Half-Life annihilates this often compulsed aspect, by detailing the plotlines that keeps the player still in control of the first-person viewpoint, leaving the cutscenes rolling while you still have full access to the gameplay and character controllability. For summarization, You will see through the eyes of Gordon Freeman at all times.  The game is a perpetual maze; leaving the player to work at tasks that involve being locked into battle and overall puzzle solving to advance through the many challenges that wait up ahead. Most of the time, the story illuminates the puzzles by the actions to proceed, such as maze scenarios and building boxes to use as staircases. Although Half-Life has short-lived loading screens from time to time after leaving a certain area for a new one, the game has no levels. But, to make up for this traditional concept, the game is split into a number of mind-boggling chapters filled with rich story and easy adaptability.  To start off with this game's story, you're none other than Gordon Freeman. A young man who holds a Ph.D in theoretical physics who starts his daily grind back at the Black Mesa Research Facility; a fictional complex that is stranded in a remote desert located in the suburbs of New Mexico. Arriving late for work yet again, you take the tram system around the Black Mesa Research Facility and at this point, objectives that his game has fulfilled such as breath-taking visuals and movie quality animation begins to blossom. The tram sequence at the beginning of the game can only be summed up in one word; Incredible. It's as if the things that come flying at you from every angle and position, almost reminiscent of watching an action-packed movie, along with the credits of the producer's names proudly fading in and out on the corner of the screen.  As you make your first step in the heavily secured facility, you're constantly reminded that you put on your Hazardous Environmental suit, or the H.E.V suit for short. While all things are hunky-dory, those things soon turn to the worst very soon. After a failed experiment, involving a collision between a rare intergalactic specimen from another dimension with an Anti-Mass Spectrometer, the Black Mesa facility falls in ruins, meaning you are one of the only key survivors of the infamous ''Black Mesa Incident''. And with this, alien life-forms from the dimension of ''Xen'' are pulled from their dimension into ours and are running amok the ruined facility, along with the Army that storm the place after the gone, haywired facility's emergency call has been echoed. This of course doesn't make things any easier and you soon find yourself battling both the aliens and the military.  While there isn't exactly much to complain about, I would admit that guiding the chickened-out scientists and professors around the facility can be quite a pain now and again due to some seldom poor AI programming, as well as the alien life-form, Vortigaunt, from which you would have to wait and be patient for them to wreck down wooden doors in front of you, as you are not capable of doing that yourself. (You do start off with a crowbar, right?) As well as I'm probably not the only one who made the same mistake by killing them through a small opening, before they did in fact begin to tear down the doors. But then again, this is where the used scripted intermissions started to show, so that's an added bonus to the magnitude of the game.  For the long run, I've had fun and joy both reviewing this amazing game and playing this amazing game. If you haven't play Half-Life or even worse, not familiar with Half-Life, it's still a big compulsory recommendation from me.",

It had become a hallmark of FPS quality for many years to come until Half-Life 2 came out to raise the bar even higher. This legendary status helps to alleviate the ravages of time the graphics have suffered. But, as any Counter-Strike player will tell you, it is not that bad considering the age of the game, it's still approachable for younger players. The game's design is very variable and interactive, which cannot be said about a myriad of modern shooters. The remarkable sound and authentic music will help to create a memorable, mysterious, sci-fi atmosphere. Xen, being the most criticized part of the game, seemed quite enjoyable to me. It offers a much needed diversion from the rest of the game, most of which takes place in steel corridors. This game represents a milestone, thanks to which a series of events lead to the creation of our beloved Steam. Praise be Half-Life, the Almighty! :)",

During an experiment gone wrong, where you're the one that pushed the crystal into the analyzer, you're the only hope of the survivors to reach the search and rescue team, because of your combinaison. However, you'll have to survive from the attacks of your coworkers transformed in zombies and creatures coming from another world. And unfortunately for you, your only weapon is a crowbar. And you're just a scientist employed by Black Mesa...  That's Half-Life for you. A scientist relying on a crowbar first before becoming an expert in weapons. The story is perhaps basic and with some twists but noneless, the universe build around Half-Life has expanded a lot.  However, if Half-Life is a FPS, which means weapons to shoot any enemies, that you can carry thanks to your wonderful combinaison, you can find some puzzles throughout the game, mainly because of the need to wander around a destroyed facility.  What's fascinating in Half-Life isn't probably the gameplay in itself. I mean, everything seems very basic. But if it wasn't for it, you wouldn't have mods like Counter-Strike around. I don't know why I was fascinated by Half-Life. I mean, it's not like jumping was new or that weapons were innovative... maybe the iconic crowbar has to do something with. Or maybe it's just that a plot, perhaps basic but very effective, the mysterious G-Man following you around and disappearing easily or that the fact it's someone that wasn't trained to become the hero of the world... or maybe the ending. I don't know but I just know that when I played it, I was fascinated.  I was fascinated by the fact that you can find survivors around that can help you, guards or scientists. Or the fact that some of them meet a tragic fate under your eyes. I was fascinated by the change of the objectives: from reaching the surface, you're now the only hope to end an invasion and the wiping of any survivor by the soldiers.  I don't remember any problem with the gameplay apart the treacherous ladders. Climbing them isn't hard. However, when you needed to step out of them OR going down, it was a challenge. And the famous jumping with the crates where you were sliding...  Half-Life has the graphics from 1998 and it was very good ones. Even now, I could still enjoy them. I don't say that it's detailed. But you can see some interesting details. And Xen, the other world, despite being a challenge, is very beautiful.  Besides, the soundtrack is also great. It's only heard during some important moments. But the music is powerful.  Half-Life is a classic to have. Gordon Freeman is a character that you can't forget.",

            "review_text": "Half-Life is my old love so I found this review kind of hard to put together, since I had to put aside my nostalgia and deliberate precisely on what makes Half-Life an excellent game, but here goes my best.  Half-Life is seemingly a classic FPS however back when It was released it was anything BUT, Half-Life was a frigging revolutionary game that defied FPS standards while still preserving what makes FPS fun and good. And Half-Life IS fun, Its got a wide and diverse range of weapons and enemies (as well as some cool bosses) and some brilliant AI that still impresses me today.  But what really makes Half-Life a really stand out game is what it does that is different. Rather then going the way of a metal gear solid game valve opted for a really interesting minimal storytelling approach in which everything is witnessed through the gameplay, there are no cutscenes of any kind. The less is more approach works and instead of long pieces of poorly written dialogue the game lets you observe first hand the chaos and destruction in the aftermath of the Black Mesa Incident. It works and the atmosphere feels like the aftermath of some kind of horrible and ongoing disaster like a huricane or a Nuclear blast In which you must fight for your life throughout the game to escape.  Rather than explain everything to you Half-Life will show you a lot of things or occasionaly say things that may confuse you. This is because you are just one man and its impossible for you to comprehend the big picture, you are small and insignificant in this grand scheme going on and while you get vague hints throughout the game as to this bigger picture the game leaves you guessing which gives the game a large sense of a forboding and sinister mystery .  This game is built on atmosphere and while the graphics have aged a lot, it is still a breath taking experiance to witness the disaster and destruction of Black Mesa. The sounds and music are top notch and aid with this of course.  If you are one of the few people who has not played Half-Life yet I really suggest that you get around to it, you wont just have fun but I think It will probably influence your opinion on how Video Game stories and atmosphere should be handled in relation to gameplay.",

To freezing cold chambers to electricity-shooting aliens, it protects you. Giving a reason why you can take so much.  The weapons are great! They're placed very well. You find the shotgun in a little base wich makes sence, you find the glock next to the dead body of a guard, etc... Also the ammo changes too! Depending on wich part of the base you are, the will be more or less of a ammo type, forcing you to use all your weapons in order to survive.  As for the story, it makes so real sence...but its great. A huge amount of mass builds up, creating a portal between Earth and the border world, ZEN were aliens have been hiding from the Combine (as seen in Half-Life 2). They flee to Earth hence why the base is over run with aliens. The militery come to kill the aliens...and the survivors. Its a goverment cover-up and you're Black Mesa's best hope of cleaning the base of all aliens and soldiers.  Over all: Buy it, you won't regret it...",

Todays 'better' animations often make you stuck on map elements, disrupting jumps, let you get stuck on ladders (♥♥♥♥ Half Life 2) or let you fell down a cliff, ignoring the jump button like Fallout 3 and Skyrim.

It is not just a single game, when you buy Half-Life you are buying literally hundreds of games.  Half-Life is an impressive game in it's own right too, the graphics were amazing for the time and the gameplay and story were great but that all pales in comparison to what this game has done for the world of gaming in general.  This is what made modding popular. This is why games today have mod support and why mods sometimes become games.  The next time you play a game with mods, with plugins, with graphical enhancement, with fan made maps, with total conversions. The next time you play a game that used to be mod.

I dont care about graphics or what year the game was made. For around the 90s this game along with doom 1 WAS THE ♥♥♥♥. If you care about graphics too much, either go get the balck mesa mod or go read the ♥♥♥♥ing wiki. That brings me to my next point, i honestly played this game only to learn the story before half life 2. Your supposed to spend about 12-13 hours on the game. I SPENT 23 HOURS. honeslty i should have just read the wiki. Another thing is the game is VERY ♥♥♥♥ING HARD. like jesus christ wtf. at times it was so confusing i needed to use a guide.

After you are done slayin Xen, you can try a higher difficulty or go onto the extremely random madness online. (good luck finding a map other than crossfire, LOL) And once you are 100% done with Half-Life, i highly reccommend checking out Opposing force or Half-Life 2 (I havent played Blue shift yet so im not gonna judge on that)  All in all, this phenamonal masterpiece will keep you on your chair for hours (dont forget to eat &amp; drink!)  Pros: A ton of PC's can handle this game smoothly Able to save almost everywhere Tons of fun exploring, parkouring and of course shooting Something with a microwave. IDK Multiple difficulty's to test your skill A lot of freedom Loading times are not that long Innovative and a wide verarity of weapons and gadgets A FREAKIN CROWBAR!  Cons: Some clipping issues Chapter On a rail Some parts can be hard, even on easy Fem assasins In some low health cases: certain parts can become impossible to get through.  Semi-con: Online mode is a bit hectic and unsorted  Final note: i reccomend buying this version rather than the Source version  9.5/10",

And you have no idea why all this ♥♥♥♥ is hitting the fan. Thats the greatness of it!

In Half Life you play silent protagonist number B. He differs from others because he has the power of the beard and a MIT degree that obviously had no concept of oral presentations. When it was released Half Life posed a new stage of interactive storytelling. But really it just means you’re allowed to turn away from all major plot points and stare at the wall. Still, the notion of alien invasions and government cover-ups are very popular themes as my good friend, Fox Mulder, will tell you. Instead I saw Half Life as the story of the nerds overpowering the jocks and saving the world that we desperately needed. Half Life went down in history as an amazing game and the introduction of raging, hormone filled teenagers to the gaming scene via the mod Counter Strike. A spine chiller looked at in comparison to Hitler nowadays. I found myself playing through Half Life many times in the small fraction of my life I have experienced (This joke would have been better if I could say half my life) and I still have one question. Why is Gordon Freeman a hero when, during my play throughs, the scientists he is supposed to be saving served him better as meat shields? A question as mysterious to me as the G-man. Last time I was called the G-man followed the statement “you hit the spot,” during several of my ‘biology’ practices. And no, those didn’t occur at MIT.",

It's pretty high up there, but NOT at the top. (Grab your pitchforks!) Half-Life is the first installment into the series and does not fail to impress. With easy to look at and understand graphics and hands-down some of the finest crafted gameplay in any game i've ever played, this game is something I could replay anytime. Most of you should already know the story and its characters, only because its a Valve game, so i'll spare the story details. While playing through Half-Life, you may notice the crazy balance between ammo and limits. There are a lot of risk-taking moments and sometimes even have you leaving to backtrack for more ammo, which does not feel tedious at all. All interactions in this game are centered around YOU. It feels like you are important to this world, like you really are trying to save it. Overall it just makes for fine story-telling. As for Gordon himself and the way other characters perceive him, it just feels dumb. EVERY other character just feels like they are lower than you, which doesn't show a challenge in the story. I don't know if Valve tried to play a safe-route when it came to the story, but it disapointed me when you felt higher than everyone. It's like having a route, A to B. At B there is a super weapon that you need but instead of walking that route, the game just brings it to you and it does not feel so rewarding.  This game is great and highly enjoyable. I'd state my cons at more of a personal pinpoint, but it's really up to you on how you feel about it.",

Simultaneously, the military has come to silence all Black Mesa workers in hopes of covering up the castastrophic incident. Traveling through the insides of the facility to the mountain sides to the strange alien world, there is always danger around the corner along with a few puzzles to get around. Even with a variety of weapons to get ahead of others, you may find yourself in a tough situation from time to time. The story behind all this is full of amazement as it goes on to the sequal. Multi-player is also an enjoyment with several maps to choose from, custom or otherwise. Players can always find an enjoyment when playing against each other whether it be underground with water traps to a bomb testing facility to Homer Simpson's house. One thing I would like to point out is the over-powered Tao Gun, a lazor weapon capable of killing people through walls with one charged shot and catapulting yourself across the map.",

I recommend getting this, it is fun once you get passed the dated feel it has.  Longer Review: Despite being a very old game (and quite noticeably so), I did enjoy it enough to complete it and for my purchase not being a waste of money. Due to it being dated, it might not be very enjoyable for some, however I still recommend playing this if you loved Half-Life 2 and sequels. I will probably not do a second playthrough, mostly because of time and there are many other games I’d like to experience, however it’s not something I’d avoid doing either. I recommend this game, because the only thing I dislike of it are the graphics, but it’s still a fun shooter and does help to set the stage and universe of the famed sequels. Buy it if you love HL2 and you don’t mind the feeling of playing an old game (and everything that means).  *Update: Looks like I’m going with a second playthrough after all. First time it took me about 21 hours to complete, so far I got 2 hours in this time. I want to experience the game again fully, so I can play the series in order now that I got all of them :D Once I finish it this time however, I'll retire the game forever. Unless Valve surprises us with Half-Life 3.. in which case I'll go through the whole series again, but lets face it, that might never happen :'( DAMN YOU VALVE KILLING OUR DREAMS!",

A lot of modern day shooters fail to provide the atmosphere and the fluid simple controls of this great title, There have been so many people reviewing this game so I'm finding it quite hard to start so i guess i shall start by telling you what the game is about.  -----SPOILERS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dr. Gordon Freeman arrives late for work at 8:47 am in the Black Mesa Research Facility, using the advanced Black Mesa tram system that leads through the facility. He arrives at the Anomalous Materials Lab, his work place, and he is informed by the security officer that the scientists have a special experiment today, so he goes to the locker room and puts on the hazard suit. He goes to the lab's lower levels, and arrives at the Anti-Mass Chamber, where he is instructed that the specimen to be used that day is the rarest and also the most unstable specimen the lab has ever worked with. He is tasked with pushing the specimen into the scanning beam of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer for analysis. However as soon as he pushes it, it explodes, and creates a sudden catastrophe called a 'resonance cascade'  -----SPOILERS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The story is really good, its actually quite funny, modern games often spend massive amounts of money on spectacular scenes and explosions and deep heart felt commentary in order to set the mood......But How does half life do it that right with a 8-10 minute opening 'TRAM RIDE' into the Black Mesa facility, and all it really is, is Mr. freeman going into work that day, and that scene alone provides one of the most enigmatic experiences i have ever felt in the prologue of a game.  players enlist the help of traumatized scientists and trigger-happy security guards to get through high-security zones, sneaking and fighting your way through ruined missile silos and Cold War cafeterias, through darkened airducts and subterranean railways. When you finally come in sight of the surface, you realize that the inhuman monsters aren't your only enemies-for the government has sent in ruthless troops and stealthy assassins. Their orders seem to be that when it comes to the Black Mesa, nothing gets out alive... and especially not you.   That said the journy would be nothing without great enemys with complex ways to kill them like the headcrabs, and nothing would kill them better than the coverted crowbar that 'Freeman' Wields. The weapons apart from that are nothing special, exept maybe the laser designated RPG launch  There are no levels in Half-Life, or, more specifically, it lacks the concept of levels and episodes we've come to expect. The game is a continual stream of locations from beginning to end. You can move back and forth at will (with only a few exceptions), as can those who are pursuing you. And though the brief loading time between zones is the one artifact that breaks the flow of the game, the transitions are thankfully brief.  Weapon, ammunition, and health placement follows the same philosophy. You'll hardly ever come across an item that is just bobbing and spinning in place like some gift from the heavens. Valve has done a good job of justifying the typical health and armor meters. Freeman is wearing a hazard suit, used by researchers involved in dangerous experiments. To regain health and armor energy, you must fill up at power stations. These are almost always located in logical places, usually near areas where dangerous work would be performed. There are no power-ups to be found. Weapons and ammo are taken from supply closets or the corpses of fallen security guards and soldiers. Even the more experimental weapons have their proper place - in the weapons research department of the facility. And late in the game, once you've left the research facility, the supply of ammo and first aid kits is believably scarce.  The only problems with Half-Life are the results of it being so ambitious. The fact that all of the humans in the game look like clones takes from the otherwise realistic atmosphere. The diversity of the levels and puzzles will undoubtedly leave you thinking some areas were better than others. But complaints that arise are simply a reaction to the fact that the game is so close to ideal. Half-Life is an exceptional single-player game and a solid multiplayer game.  ---------------------------------------- 10/10 - masterpiece",

Let's be honest, the game has aged a bit, but still holds up pretty well - same goes for the sequel. There has been developed a mod that updates the game to the Source engine and most of the game as a single player campaign except for the last chapter. Just so you know that if you are put off by an 15 year old marvel, due to the graphics, there are 'remade' editions. The game is very well supported by its fan base, which it earned back in the '90s and '00s. Story telling taken into consideration, having played Half Life would help one's understanding of the story when playing Half Life 2. Like, A LOT. Without the knowledge of the events in Half Life, you have no idea who Barney is, Doctor Kleiner, Doctor Vance or the HEV suit. Or why the hell of this matters, or who the hell the guy in the fancy suit is. You'll have as much understanding of the situation at hand, than a stoner who accidentally walked into a mathematics class and stayed. So yeah, just ♥♥♥♥ing buy the game already. Unless you were born in the '00s – and in which case bugger off the internet for another six years – you don't have an excuse for not having played this game.",

The story takes place in the research facility of Black Mesa where a Resonance Cascade takes place, where the portal between Zen and Earth has broke lose where the alien creatures have come to invade. You take role as Gordan Freeman a silent protagonist which may be unsettling to some but I think it fits well so you can immerse yourself as the role and save the day. The level design is well fitting and wide open including tons of secrets that can be hidden like extra health packs, ammo, easter eggs and many more. The music is very action packed specially when you take fight against the baddies. The multiplayer is still populated and fun specially for how old it is and it includes tons of play hours and there is 2 expansion packs which are dirt cheap and just add even more. The only thing that I could 'critique' about the game is that most of the voice acting sounds really cheesy and maybe the graphics but it's what you expect with an old engine.",

Story: The story is about a middle-aged scientist, Gordon Freeman, who has signed up to work at the Black Mesa Research facility. After an experiment went  HORRIBLY  wrong, Freeman must now fight his way through the enormous compunds of Black Mesa to survive. Later he is told that soldiers have arrived to rescue them, but is it really so?  Gameplay: The gameplay is fun and interesting, and was at the time different from most First-person shooters. Half-Life focused less on the guns and required more thinking to succed. This is a great thing. The guns are still there, and most of them are fun to use, like the Shotgun and Pistol. Overall, the gameplay is superb, and holds up well even today.  Music: The music is great, and fits the game perfectly. Some of the music feels creepy, like 'Space Ocean' which plays after the disastrous experiment, and other pieces get you pumped, like 'Drums and Riffs' which plays after you launch a rocket at a later part in the game.  Overall, Half-Life was great back 1998 when it came out, and is still great even to this day. Pick it up if you got the chance, you will by no means regret it.  EDIT: Given the new steam sale, i think this game deserves to win as while it may show some age by now, gameplay wise it's still jsut as fun as it was back when it was released. It has stood the test of time.  10/10",

Everyone has heared of this fantastic game so i dont need to say anything witty before i write this review cause youre gonna know the outcome before the final sentence. In Half Life we play as Gordan Freeman. A scientist at Black Mesa who is tasked to stop an Alien Invasion before its too late. Half Life is one of the most outsanding games i have played to date and it shows that this game is a classic which will never be forgotten. Half Life is a FPS where you run and gun through enviroments and weirdly enough some platforming segments as well. The game is very fast paced but in some sections you will need to slow down if you dont want to die. The game is incredibly fun to play and without a doubt is one of the best games i have ever played. But there are some issues with this Gold Source version that arent present in the Source remake. The game has many bugs that will probably never get patched. Some of these bugs are game breaking and might force you to use cheats to get through some sections. Overall Half Life is a fantastic game and without a doubt if there are any people who havent played this game by now go get this game and the rest of the series this instant. I give Half Life a 8/10",

Now the gameplay is spot-on. It feels so damn good. I remember feeling like a Badass when i was a little kid and i got the endgame weapons and when i killed the final boss, I felt soo good. This game has some of the best mods too. If you get this game you can get some mods that feel like their on game, try out Afraid of Monsters DC, PARANOIA, and They Hunger. One mod even became its own game! Cry of Fear (Go play that one too). Overall its my favorite game ever made.

I might have nostalgic feelings towards that style, but it was clear even back then for me that games like Unreal would age a bit better.

Until a few months ago when i finally bought the game on steam ($10.99 still worth it) and finally beat it. I gotta say even though some of Half life's graphics are outdated it still makes for some of the best FPS gameplay I have ever played out of any other game. I beat the game in one sitting and still to this day still consider it as one of the best first person shooters I have ever played. I dont care if Valve'll ever make a Half life 3, because they created one of the best masterpieces in the gaming industry that revolutionalized the first person shooter genre alongside the original Doom.

Not much to say other than, this series is one of the greatest I have played, so regardless of small things about Half Life 1 i rant about like a dweeb, like the voice acting sounds like it was tape recorded, or it is almost part of the game to lose 10 health to headcrabs unless you are 20 feet from them with a handgun.  However the game does have a few annoying as hell in game things, one of few, is that there is no point in cover, as enemies will spring right up to you, close enough to smell your horrible breath, and stand there shooting, sometimes as I have noticed, they run up to you, set a bomb down and run away. And it is like ... why? I am in cover, 90 percent of the time, You may as well not stand behind the wall as they will appear within seconds. Another related thing is bomb spams. Every 20 odd seconds if your enemy is still about and not ran to you, expect a bomb landing perfectly next to you. Other than that, not a bad game in which started a class series",

            "review_text": "Admittedly I could've worded my last review better. Half-Life is a classic, but it's not one that holds up that much. It hasn't aged well, I'm trying to say. And I have plenty of reasons why.   -LEVEL DESIGN-  Atmospherically, Half-Life 1 is amazing. Really. The idea of a scientific complex falling into chaos all around you as you desperately try to escape is executed really well, and it's one of the most atmospheric games of its time. That's where my positive points end. In terms of level design itself, Half-Life 1 is bad. Really bad. There's no map system which is inexcusable in a game so labryinthine. On top of that, a lot of the levels can get cryptic and annoying, some are nearly impossible if you don't have enough health. Like the dam in Surface Tension, where you have to dodge both a fish monster and helicoptor fire while also standing in place opening a valve for just long enough to start drowning. I've hit roadblocks throughout the whole game, barely going 15 minutes without hitting a dead end and being stuck for twice that time. At least, that's my experience. Black Mesa does everything so much better. It's really the best version of HL1. If you want a better experience with this game, go get that. Who cares about Xen?   -Gameplay-  Half-Life's actual gameplay is its strong point. It has lots of unique weapons, all of which are really fun to use. Like, really. There are a LOT of weapons. They're all really cool. Other than that, it's okay. I really don't think I have to describe HALF-LIFE'S gameplay to you.   Especially considering you most likely filtered reviews to 'Negative' looking for something to be mad about.   But I do like the gameplay. However, as the levels went on, I started noticing a trend in my playstyle. I would just run past all the enemies, speedrunner-style. I don't really know why. Maybe it was the level design making fights unrewarding. Maybe I just wanted to beat the game to get it over with. But the most likely conclusion is that fighting enemies in HL1 is very unrewarding. In most cases you end up taking more damage by fighting than if you just dash through the area. And as mentioned, the level design doesn't help either. Nearly every enemy uses hitscan and sometimes you're pitted up against nearly 8 of them at once in a singe room.   -Rapid-fire of the smaller bits-   Music:  The game uses music very sparingly. If there's a song, it'll only play once at a key point of the game. So most of the game is quite silent. That's okay, I guess. I don't like silent games, but It's just an excuse to use my own music. The songs it does play are pretty good, though.  Story:  Easily the best part of the game. I already mentioned how much I like the atmosphere, but the story is pretty good. That's all I'll say.  Is it fun?:  Kinda. Things go pretty well until you hit a killjoy roadblock. Something I really like about the game, though, is how small the hitboxes on projectiles are. You can hit someone through the tiniest crack in a wall with a crossbow without the bolt stopping in mid-air on the surrounding walls. If you can see the enemy, you can hit them. Can that be said for many other games? Refer to Level Design for my thoughts on the killjoys.   -Overall-  Look, I get it. Half-Life 1 is a decent game. But it's not a masterpiece. It has a lot of flaws, and I generally didn't enjoy playing this. I really want to like the game, because it's HALF-LIFE. But too much of the game design frustrated me to the point of never wanting to play it again. I did beat the game. But it felt like a chore more than anything. I didn't enjoy Xen at all. Who does? Really though, if you want to play through the best version of Half-Life, go get Black Mesa. It fixes EVERYTHING this game does wrong, and improves on it. If you want a better first-party Half-Life experience, get HL2. It's way more fun in every way and has its own unique set of weapons. Overall, Half-Life 1: Good gameplay, ruined by awful level design. That being said though, it is quite moddable. Give the community creations a shot sometime, and you may like it better.  6/10 ",

You can kill enemy A.I without them noticing you, and it can takes far to long to kill simple soldiers, even if you stand right in front of them with a shotgun, and blast them.  But I did like some things about it. The voice acting is pretty good for the game, and the aiming is spot on. Also the fact that if you run ut of ammo for one weapon, you got a ton more to choose.  But none of it made me play the game for that long. I give it a 5/10 mediorcer at best.  It may have changed the FPS, but it did not age well.",

You play as the World's Biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥: Gordon Freeman (originally Ivan the Gay Space Biker, but the design team luckily managed to convince Gabe Newell to stop shoving his bear fetish into all of their shovelware) whose grand job with a degree from MIT at a highly top-secret government research facility is to push a box with wheels into a portal (A clever reference to the popular phrase 'The cake is a lie' from Super Mario 64.) Of course, it becomes pretty clear that Gordon is a ♥♥♥♥ing failure as he inadvertently tears time and space a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and lets some faggy looking E.T. rip-offs into our planet. SLICK MOVES YOU ♥♥♥♥ING NERD.  The game barely constitutes a 'First Person Shooter' as you spend the first 30 minutes trying to jump on crates hanging 500 ft. in the air, only to fall to your doom because the laws of physics don't apply to Gordon and he slides on any surface like it's coated with a pig's ♥♥♥ sweat. If you don't immediately turn off the game in disgust and contemplate never touching a video game again, you're obviously just too ♥♥♥♥ing stupid because this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doesn't get any better. Every enemy is a bullet sponge that'll make any Xenophile cream themselves at first sight. Just as it seems this 'game' can't be anymore of an utter insult to the medium, you have to fight squads of super soldiers at once, capable of taking five shotgun blasts to the face point blank while an elite Helicopter shoves its Gatling Gun up your ♥♥♥ and primes the barrel without lube. Repeat this formula for a seemingly endless number of boring, cliche 'abandoned science lab' set-pieces and you have Half-Life.  It's mind boggling to think that 'gaming journalists' constantly suck Valves ♥♥♥♥ because they managed to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with 'cool' scripted events in it. It's really just more proof that corruption and bribery was rampant in this decadent and 'barren of originality' industry from the beginning.  4/10: at least you made the 'quit' button the most appealing in any video game since.",

Though I really wouldn't recommend using the series as a guide or walkthrough.  Before Half-life, I gone ahead and played Half-life 2 and the following episodes of the series first. Why? I was still in High School and playing on an XBOX then XBOX360 on the orange box. Looking back at the predeceeding games weren't the first thing on my mind, and now I feel happy to say that I played Half-life. My expectations for the game's environment and focus was well met, and gave not much but some idea why the Gordon Freeman character in Half-life 2 is so idolized. Part of the idolization is from being a highly accommidated scientist, not only surviving the resonance cascade but resolving it, and what I suspect being the perfect lab rat for extreme scientific development.   My main question is, is the game too long? The sudden shift of that almost puzzle solving and master bulgary training suddenly turned into persistant gunfights, and a near impossible boss fight that the game will get you addicted enough to fight through. Some chapter became as short as I-here-at-point-a-and-out. I lost count of the number of chapters, but I know the Half-life 2 saga didn't have any break a 15 chapter limit. I enjoyed the game more for the puzzle-solving aspects that I felt made it different from yet-another-pray-and-shoot sort of gameplay. Not to forget an almost comical atmosphere provided by how well the game sell such an absurb chain of events.",

The suit also shows your oxygen levels while you are under water or the power level of your torch.  The main type of enemies you will be fighting are aliens, there are also humans to fight as well.

Most modern gamers shy away from Half-Life because of it's 1998 graphics but if you look past that you'll find an amazing experience... You play as Gordon Freeman a scientist working at the Black Mesa facility when an experiment that you're a part of goes terribly wrong and opens up a portal linking Earth and Xen (Zen) from there on, hoardes of alien's invade the place and you're goal is SURVIVING... Game play wise it flows well and I don't have any complaints about the game play EXCEPT their is way to much jumping in this game... This is just a minor complaint I did love the parkour puzzles because they worked in the game flawlessly as you're traveling through the complex.... The parkour PUZZLES were fantastic but navigating through them proved to be a little difficult and taxing at times... But don't overlook this game because of this minor problem because you'll be missing out on an amazing game! I also like Half-Life because it had great interactive story telling... I mean, sure you could just ignore the scientist and fly right through the game but then you would miss out on the extraordinary experience which is really what Half-Life is all about (and be completly lost and confused by the end of it aswell)... Half-Life has a great beginning even though it is a little boring but I loved that first 20 minutes of strolling through the office and talking to you're co-scientist because it gets you involved with the game.... Half-Life has great narrative pacing which you just don't see in games anymore today..... I also loved Half-Life because the enviroments are so detailed... I have played Half-Life three times already and I still keep finding new room's and compartments in Black Mesa that have ammo and health packs in them.... But although the setting and events of the game are entirly fictional, the detail in first person shooter's had never felt so absorbingly real at the time that it was realised..... So we can blame it for every other thing done in the name of 'realism' every since.... I'm talking about Call of Duty, Battlefield, and all the other shooter games that now control 80% of the freakin industry today.... Which I don't hate shooters but Half-Life used it for innovation in gaming, shooters today could care less about quality as long as they're stealing your money.... So just to recap Half-Life has an incredible interactive story, fantastic enviroments with impeccable details, and has suprises and jump scares that you won't see coming even if it is you're second or third time playing the game.... Half-Life is only $9.99 on Steam and if you haven't already played it YOU NEED TO! Even if you aren't in to FPS games and especially if you are.",

Here is my Stance:  As an already late fan into the series with Half-Life 2, it of course is odd to backtrack 6 years in engines and graphics. Although I like good games, so this did not bother me. TL:DR, the game is incredible. For a game almost 20 years old, it truly stands the test of time.   It does have some faults that can be easily overlooked. First being is being an old FPS, it's difficult even on 'Normal' difficulty. I found about 2 bugs in the game. 1 being where I would be stuck in place and 'noclip' wouldn't even work. So I would have to reload my save, this happened twice. But if you're a longtime pc FPS player, you shouldn't have problems doing that if you quicksave like a fat kid on cake. And the other being right before you *SPOILER* encounter covert ops, the game would crash, this was just trial and error, again twice, by just reloading.   The game is a masterpiece, buy it for sure as this summer sale is going on. Buy it if the summer sale isn't. It's truly a piece of history and art that should be experienced.",

The release of Black Mesa on Early Access inspired me to play the original game and the fact that I started first with Half-Life 2 and wanted more, which coincidentally I can compare the two on their merits.  To keep this out of the way, Half-Life may be old by now, but it has dated very well in many terms. The graphics are old, but very impressive for their time, it's quite smooth, the shooting works great and the unbroken first-person gameplay is still great as it is today. It may not be so important now considering that game like Bioshock, Far Cry 3 and this games own sequel got ahold of the method, but not many can do it as well as the original Half-Life and it still engages you into the game and makes for an excellent narrative method. Much like the sequel, the game despite being a shooter, also includes variety in plataforming, exploring and navigation that make the game varied and avoids getting stale as you continue.  Now, although I really liked this game, there are several things that hold it back from being a favorite of mine. Now, I don't know if it's the difficulty level (I played in normal throughout), but some of the enemies have a bad case of bullet sponge, which can be quite annoying. Another things would be the fact that despite the cool soundtrack and its greatness when it's used in battles and certain moods, there's not a lot of music throughout. Finally of course, there's Xen, which while I certainly thought it had great ideas, wasn't a very inspiring last level and the last boss battle can feel a bit anticlimatic, partly due to the teleporting breaking you into different areas and not keeping any momentum and also a lack of music and epic tone that tells 'This is it, time to show who is the boss!'. At the very least the last scenes were very intriguing and do a nice ending.  I guess another thing would be that what the first game did great, the second game did a lot better in every department, including and actually awesome final level and a better immersion for the player, which doesn't mean that the first game can't be awesome on its own right, but feels a bit overshadowed compared to the sequel and dated in some respects.  Despite all that I said, I still had a great time with Half-Life and I do consider it a masterpiece for its time. It's definitely influenced many things that gaming would adopt and really showed what PC gaming was capable of.",

You fight against the following: -Headcrabs -Houndis -Zombies -Marines -Bullsquids -Vortigaunts -Alien Grunts -Flying Brain Aliens -The Black Ops -Giant Vortigaunt looking things -Barnicles -AND SO MUCH MORE! The Marines comes in, want you, wants answers, makes assumptions, attacks you. They're a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥. Hell, you're left for dead in a trash compactor (*insert witty reference to Star Wars here*). You then go to Lambda Core and talk to scientists to flood a reactor, leading you to Xen. Killing a bunch of aliens, inhabitants of Xen. Then going to Nihilanth, the last of his' kind, killing him, then takes you the G-Man, who now owns Xen, and offers you a job to do stuff, or death. Death makes you fight a bunch of Xen Enemies; It is non-cannon. Accepting G-Man's offer is the cannon ending, this leads to Half-Life 2. Overall, as I've said before, Half-Life still holds ground as a big game and is amazing in difficulty, gameplay, and story.  Not Serious Version: You play as Gorgeous Freeman, a 27-year old C.I.T (Cambridged Institute of Technololgy) Graduate working in White Mesa. You are about to insert a yellow crystal and ♥♥♥♥ happens, causing all of White Mesa to become a scary place where scary stuff happens. You go up against this stuff: -ALIENS N' STUFF -MILITARY PEOPLE -THE WHITE OPS -A GIANT ♥♥♥♥ING BABY The Military are a bunch of poo-poo heads. You then go for revengance after being nearly turned into a pancake (which would taste delicious). You then go to Half-Life Symbol Core, then going to Zen, a world of evil aliens and stuff. COMITTING MASS GEONOCIDE AGAINST AN ALIEN RACE IS FUN! YOU LISTEN TO AN EVIL BABY WISPER STUFF AND THEN makes you fight him. After opening his' mind, you are taken to the GG-Man, who now is in control of this place. And offers you a new boring job, or a fight against CUTE FLUFFY BUNNIES. Waiting too long takes you to the CUTE FLUFFY BUNNIES. Taking GG-Man's new job gives you a job with no wage, and the ability to fight stuff for the rest of your life. And in the end, Gorgeous Freeman is a sexy man with a sexy face and a sexy butt with an arsenal that would make just about every video game badass ♥♥♥♥ their pants made of gold.",

First of all the combat was only meh, it was innovative for the time and the AI was brilliant but you could get stuck in some game breaking moments for example having exremely low health before a massive combat section where it is impossible not to get hit. I didn't even finish Half Life because of this issue, I didn't want to/didn't how to use cheats back then so often I had to restart the entire game or start from a much earlier save and this completely killed the game for me.   Some points were extremely frustrating on a gameplay level, like the fact that you are always either sprinting or walking. This made some of the platforming segments hell because you would run too fast or you would walk too slowly, you could also stop or speed up in mid air which really disoriented me when I played the game and I could never get past some of these sections until the onset of cheats. The storytelling was innovative but it was bland in general, this problem spans to half life 2 as well - more on that soon. Sometimes it was difficult to make out what people were saying and what they meant, you could also kill NPC's when they are vital to opening a door and then you are ♥♥♥♥ed.   In half life 2 they make it out like Barney, Kleiner and Eli were major characters in Half Life 1 but you wouldn't know that unless you played Blue Shift, which most people didn't. In the original game kleiner and eli get about 2 and a half minutes of overall screen time and then they are supposed to be big characters in the second game, Barney is seen on the tram ride but again you wouldn't know that unless you played Blue Shift.   The problem with HL is that it wanted to do combat and visual storytelling but it couldn't decide which it wanted to do more of. There are too many points where you are just walking down a corridor with nothing interesting or important anywhere and then you are thrown into an unnecessary combat scenario that is followed by an npc opening a door for you and then you are back to the corridor, rinse and repeat. Occasionally you may need to deal with a helicopter or a boss - type alien, but that is it.   Don't get me wrong I think that Half Life is good but it was flawed then and it is flawed now and I think that people get lost in the hype. It's a good thing that Black Mesa is a thing because then I might actually finish the damn game. Half Life 2 was a major improvement, but for some reason Half Life 1 never does anything to me because I never liked it when I first played the game.",

Pros This game has a pretty awesome arsenal of weapons the Taul cannon is probably my favorite The alien creatures are very well designed and memorable for the most part The human ai can be pretty good at times focusing on target, flanking, acting wounded and using exsplosives appropriately For it's time the level design was pretty good at depicting an advanced government research facility  It's pretty awesome how every living thing in this game can be gibed into a puddle of gore Autosaves can be a lifesaver sometimes in this game when you've screwed up with your quicksaves  Cons This game can be a bit buggy one bug even prevented me from making progress unless I restrarted the level   The Xen levels...   Trying to climb down a ladder in this game can be a nightmare The boss battles were pretty lame and one of the bosses design/attacks was a bit to suggestive Platforming isn't very fun in this game  I'd personaly recomend this game any day but considering how generous valve can be with there sales I'd recomend picking it up during a sale as part of the complete Half-life pack or you could get these games one at a time but a fair warning with all the exspanion packs that's gonna take awhile   ",

The first of its kind in too many ways to count, Half Life is a must-play for anyone interested in, well, to name a few examples: storytelling in games, game and level design, character AI; and, especially, games history. The ways in which this game revolutionized the industry are innumberable - with most being good, but some being rather horrificly bad, as a result of many in the industry failing to understand what made this title truly special. Seriously - if you have even the most remote interest in any of the topics I previously listed, you owe it to yourself to play this game all the way through.

Next thing you know you have to crowbar yourself through a facility to find a way to escape or stop the invasion. Yes, this is the plot. Sadly there is not so much lore that you actually get told. Though the plot is very deep, especially towards the ending, you do not know exactly what is going on all the time and just follow your path clueless.  Gameplay Since Half-life runs on the source engine, you might be familiar with its controls and gameplay. The game is a nice mix between shooting stuff and solving puzzles and trying desperately to find out how to get further. Sometimes this can be extremely frustrating and I once stopped playing it for about 6 months before picking it up again. On the other hand you feel really smart when you do not get stuck for an hour. One small uncomfortable thing is switching weapons, because in order to do that you must klick to confirm your weapon switch.  Graphics As you already saw in the screenshots above, the game is older and thus does by far not come up with modern graphics, models, animations or other. It will not bother you, but if you are used to modern games with high end graphics you might miss many details.  Bugs One time a gate did not open, even though it should have. It took me a while until I realised that, but the best way to solve this problem is to simply use the console command noclip and fly through it.  The game is a classic and I recommend you playing it, since his sequels are even better and when half-life 3 comes out one day and you want to play it, why not play the other ones too. Maybe do not buy it for 10€, rather think of buying it in a bundle when it is on sale. ",

Though the story mode is long, it's one of those games that when you complete it, you'll put it away for a few months.

HALF-LIFE needs no introduction, out in 1998 it had a very powerful impact in the industry, back in a time when FPS was all about running and gunning through narrow corridors HALF-LIFE single handedly changed that trend, it was a revolution of its time and was a direction for game developers.  The story is very simple, you are a scientist who works for a top secret research facility, one day an experiment goes horribly wrong and it rips open a portal to another dimension, the base is riddled with alien life forms and in order to confront the situation the govt. dispatches soldiers, their mission is not only to wipe out the threat but also the evidence which includes the entire Black Mesa science team including you, it’s all about survival. Simple story but the game has a very powerful sense of narration, story-telling and presentation.   Its crafted so well that it stands the test of time even today, the ones who played this game when it was released know why HALF-LIFE is praised so much, the ones who play it today find it stale, I don’t blame them but fact is that this was the first game to implement narration and ingame story telling without the player leaving control, no cut scenes or anything that takes you away from the player, even levels have a cohesive transition, they are merged by loading screens so the game feels like a smooth flow. Games today lack that kind of flow. The premise of the game is so well designed it feels like a living breathing world with an ecosystem.   It’s the game that merges old school shooters with new or lets just say it brings shooters to a whole new direction. there is a wide variety of weapons at your disposal, each one of them behaves so perfect that shooting is very satisfactory, also there is a wide variety of foes who have different behavior, today these things are very common but imagine all of these things in 1998, it bagged more than 60 GOTY awards.   The level design, the sound design, the atmosphere, the feel of claustrophobe and isolation, the desperation of survival are some of the attributes that make HALF-LIFE.  If there was no HALF-LIFE, there wouldn’t have been VALVE, this is the game that made them, gave them this legendary stature.   For the love of gaming play this. You owe it to yourself.",

No comparison, Half life wins right off the bat.  -The story is one that any gamer, new fans or old, would be sucked into and not leave their chairs until it was done.

Valve Software's (Presently, Valve Corporation's), 1998 game, Half-Life, is a masterpiece of gaming that never lets up from start to finish. A masterfully, perfect balance of storyline, pacing, action and atmosphere, don't pass this one up! The premise of the story, sees its protagonist, Seattle, Washington, native, Gordan Freeman, a graduate of MIT and having a Ph.D in theoretical physics on his first day of work at an undisclosed location in the New Mexican desert, known as the Black Mesa Research Facility. On a normal day of work, (wouldn't you know that it had to happen on his first day) devastation ensues when a science experiment goes horribly wrong by his own hand or at least partly by his own hand. He doesn't really know what's going on because everything has happened so very quickly, but all he knows is that he must rise to the occasion. He must take on a sense of responsibility for his own actions and attempt to escape the Black Mesa Research Facility, alive, all the while fighting off dimensional aliens and the military forces that have been sent in to clean up the evidence (mess lol). He also enounters the mysterious, G-Man, along the way. A mysterious and eerie figure with a suit and briefcase. One can only assume that Gordon Freeman, because of being a silent character, is constantly questioning what is going on as a result of his actions. He doesn't know but he does it, anyway. Quite the hero! When the player gets to the end of the game, he finds that there's time for only a bit of relief and none for celebration of actually being able escape the facility and Xen, alive, as the mysterious G-Man offers to either hire on Freeman or offer him 'an anticlimax'. There's also quite a bit to say about the G-Man but very little at the same time. Whether the G-Man is a person, some sort of an entity or a figment of the imagination brought on by some sort of attempted mind control or experiments (possibly, government-owned), is not, yet, known. Perhaps, the in-game character of G-Man could even be a reflection of his real life counterpart. On the topic of the soundtrack. The entire soundtrack was brilliant and fit extremely well into the entire atmosphere and storyline of the game. My favorite OST from the Half-Life Original Soundtrack, was Sirens in the Distance. Sirens in the Distance encompassed a sense of eerieness, mystery, perseverance, and was a firm reminder that an average person turned hero now has a sense of duty to take responsibility for his own actions, to not only fight for his own survival but little does he know at the time, the fate of the world as well. The OST begins with hearing the sirens blare twice, over and then the music begins to mimic the sirens and it seems to kind of merge with them at the same time, which was a very creative, move. To me, this OST marks the beginning when his present predictament finally sinks in to Gordon and he really begins to wonder if his actions may not be contained solely within the confines of the facility, itself but may have spread to the outside, world as well. What's happening out there? Is it the same that's happening in, here? Could it be worse? These are imporant questions for when we get to the second game, Valve's Half-Life 2 (2004), things start to be brought into a perspective a bit clearer than, before. We now know that the disaster has made a significant spread into the world, outside of the Black Mesa Research Facility, that the predicatament is worse than originally, thought. The brilliantly developed, protagonist, Gordon Freeman is the single greatest video game character in history. What I really love about Gordon Freeman, above all the other traits, is that the player knows quite a bit about him but also really nothing at the same time. His silent demeanor speaks volumes and allows the player to constantly question what is on his mind. We never really know for sure. He is also a humble reminder that one person, one man, can be enough to make a difference in the world. In a way, Gordon Freeman, is us or at the least a reflection. Of what could happen at any given moment when we least expect, it. Would we rise to be the hero? Again, this is a masterful game with a wonderful main character. A transition, from average person to Hero of the moment and eventually of the world, a man who continues his fight for survival against overwhelming odds, regardless of what comes before him, the ability to take responsiblity for one's own actions, etc. There are so very many motifs and without Half-Life, gaming wouldn't be where it is, today. A winner of over 50 game of the year awards and rightfully, so!  9.9/10.0  or   Round to 10/10, if you feel that you must. ",

Half-Life threw that concept out and set a new level for future FPS's to meet.  Set in the Black Mesa underground research facility in the New Mexico desert the player takes the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a MIT graduate in theoretical physics, who is helping do research on teleportation but one experiment goes wrong and opens a portal to another planet whose inhabitants attack and try taking over the facility. All the while, Gordon Freeman’s goal is close the portal and escape alive.  Gameplay is standard fair for a FPS, the player has weapons to shoot and gains a better arsenal as the game progresses. But what set Half-Life apart from all the other games of the time was that Half-Life integrated a thorough storyline that unfolded just as if the player was actually there. The graphics look blocky by today's standards but was a graphical powerhouse back in 1998 with clear faces of the NPC’s and moving mouths during dialogue all in real time with the game’s engine. Sound in the game is sparse to convey the idea that the player is stuck in a underground facility but some music is heard during boss or major actions scenes and are quite memorable because of the situations.  In the end Half-Life was a major release that no one saw coming and changed the way other FPS’s, and some other game genres, were made and told stories.  9/10",

Objectives are not clearly marked and you will often find yourself wandering around trying to figure exactly where you should be going next...which is fine if you're ok with a little exploration. Aiming is weird...it's sort of automatic, but still feels weird compared to newer games. There's no base controller support and aiming/moving with keyboard and mouse just doesn't quite feel right. The character often feels like he's walking on ice. Walking along small ledges and stuff or trying to make some jumps is a total nightmare. You literally cannot see your character's feet so it's also impossible to tell exactly where you are when trying to get around laser sensor things or the radioactive waste until you set off a mine, activate a turret, or start taking damage from the radiation.  Basically, it's a pretty good game, and, as far as I can tell, really set the bar for FPS type games going forward from it, but it also feels really dated and can be really aggravating.   -Edit-FML. I can't bring myself to finish the game. Got to Gonarch and just simply can't get through it because it keeps glitching out and the combat and stuff in this game just isn't fun so I have zero desire to pick up from an earlier spot, especially just to start the Gonarch fight all over again. :( I have failed in this undertaking, but it's just not worth it to me right now to continue on.",

That Christmas, I got a copy of the Half-Life: Platinum Collection (2nd Version), which came with: HL: GOTY, OpFor, BS, the original CS, &amp; TFC. Still to this day, I have the box with that awesome flap along with the CD's in their sleeves &amp; the bulky manual. I was the happeiest ♥♥♥♥in' teen ever that Christmas, finally experiencing all of the games on my, at the time, Dell laptop. Sadly, the CD versions cannot run on my now Windows 10 operating system. However, my nostalgia lives on via the Steam ports. The atmosphere, the story, the characters, the loads of guns, science-fiction done correctly, if you ask me.

It also contains mostly no spoilers except the final paragraph.  Half-Life 1 was a science-fiction FPS shooter first released in 1998 that revolutionized narriative in FPSs and Games in general. It was the story about a scientist named Gordon Freeman (our silent protagonist) escaping the Black Mesa after a dimension-colliding event known as the Ressonance Cascade brings forth several hostile creatures from Xen.   What do I think of it? Well for starters here's the pros and cons  Pros: Great use of combining narriative with gameplay and immersion, story is great, gameplay is awesome, weapon and skill progression is well-implemented, boss fights are fun (with the exception of Gargantuas and the tesla coil), level design is well-made and memorable, good shooting mechanics and controls, shift-jump is awesome, upgrading to a new weapon feels rewarding and gives a sense of progression, the chapter names sound awesome (maybe that's just me).  Cons: Platforming is outdated and the controls for it are incredibly slippery, some levels can seem unfair, a few minor glitches (like a glarring one in Aprehension wherein Gordon can be stuck in a black room after the cutscene when the soldiers drag him through the hallway), HD Models is the default and turning it off still has a few things of the original game that are missing/modified, hit-box issues with headcrabs for melee, tons of frustration.  Despite the amount of cons, the pros manage to outweigh them (at least in my opinion), Half-Life 1 was a revolutionary step for first-person shooters and narriative and honestly, I wish there were more games like Half-Life, especially in it's setting, plot, level-design and progression in general (not in it's platforming though).  Another con I forgot to mention (I left this last since it's incredibly opinionated), when I finished the game, I felt a sense of nostalgia, a sense of acomplishment, a sense of everything coming to fruition. Sure I was enjoyed the journey, but I wanted to see Gordon back home, and seeing him be locked by The G-Man himself made me go play Half-Life 2 to see what would happen. This would normally be a pro but then when I finished that game I ended up playing through the rest of the episodes to see what would happen, then I finally got to that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cliff-hanger. And now everyday, I await for a Half-Life 3, so we can finally see Gordon reach the goal he wanted to reach ever since the first game, to finally go back home and for everything to go back to normal.   In all honestly, I recommend it, but if those cons or anything I mention is something that you wouldn't enjoy, then it's up to you whether to pick up the game or not.",

            "review_text": "One of the few near flawless games ever made, Half Life admitedly does have some frustrating and rather dated niggles, which I'll bring up before anything else. The platforming is actually quite bad. It never works that well in first person unless climbing mechanics are made entirely contextual. In Half Life, of course, nothing is contextual and you are in complete control of Freeman at all times. When the numerous platforming sections come around, though, the game feels extremely sensitive and you are expected to jump and land onto some really ridiculously narrow platforms to progress. It becomes a real exercise in frustration, and trial and error is often the only way of knowing whether or not Freeman will land on the platform or fall right to his doom. I guess the creation of such an impressive physics engine means that the developers will make it their civic duty to show it off as much of it as feasible in the game. It's just that Valve took a little too much liberty in showing it off in Half Life.   As I've said before, Half Life is a near flawless game, let down only by it's jumping sections. Ignoring those, and you should, this is one of the very best FPSs ever made, possibly THE greatest FPS game ever made. It's ridiculously good. The worldbuilding is astonishingly lifelike, the aliens quirky and instantly iconic thanks to their imaginative designs, the weapon selection is marvellous and transformed the straightforward crowbar into a symbol of gaming culture and the story is one of the strongest in gaming. Seriously, the feeling of being part of a grand conspiracy far greater than your own understanding, together with being the unwitting hero tasked to save the world from an alien invasion and travelling through the chaos happening all around you makes for a rip-roaring roller coaster of a game that never gets boring or repetitive, well, ever really.   Gunplay is appropriately meaty and cathartic, yet with an added sense of realism that you didn't find with other FPS classics like Quake and Doom. I rate this game better than Half Life 2, on the grounds that the gameplay is just as good but the story can be treated as one holistic story rather than the mere beginnings of a grander story planned to be told in something like, say, erm a TRILOGY. Yeah it basically boils down to Half Life 1 not ending on a cliffhanger which will likely never be resolved, as it's sequel did.   So yeah, buy Half Life if you haven't already, experience one of the few games that can truly be called a 'Citizen Kane of Gaming' and don't read THAT much into the greater plot going on. That way, you can feel wholly satisfied with everything this amazing game offers and not go mad waiting for the final chapter to be released sometime in the next 3000 years.  9.5/10",

What that is, exactly, cannot be put into a simple sentence, it's even difficult desribing it in a whole review!  Some of the features you get with Half Life: Fluent controls with fun action and much more.  The story of Half Life is very interesting. You see, you are a scientist that works for Black Mesa (a scientific research lab for a bunch of cool stuff), during a certain test with a portal thing, all Hell breaks loose. There are aliens EVERYWHERE, scientists and security guards are dying, and, to make matters worse, some marines that are coming to '''save''' you come down to the labs. I mean, all of this stuff is going on, and you just want to leave. Gordon Freeman (the player) doesn't speak, nobody knows why, but he doesn't.  The gameplay in Half Life is extremely fun and action packed; even by today's standards. I'd say it's better than some of our FPS games today! You can pick up health and charge up your HEV suit, a suit designed for specific tests that go on in Black Mesa. A fully charged suit can make you survive a LOT longer then with just health, as health easily drains without suit power.  You have a very wide selection of weapons in Half Life; from a crowbar to experimental energy weapons. Each weapon has their own unique use. For example: The crowbar is useful for killing weak enemies such as headcrabs and wounded enemies, it can also be used to easily open crates. Some weapons are better for close range (shotgun, assault rifle?, and crowbar), and some for far range (revolver, that one energy rifle thing, crossbow, Ghostbuster gun).  The enemies in Half Life are actually pretty challenging to fight, the marines specializing in ranged combat and explosives and the aliens with melee and more energy attacks. Some enemies, such as the headcrab, are very easy to kill, but are found in larger numbers.  Music the music in Half Life is pretty good, but there is no constant music, which is pretty nice.  Online multiplayer, yeah, that's right, online multiplayer. Well, asside from the troubles of finding a server, the multiplayer is pretty fun and I actually kind of love it. So fun. But the only problem is that barely anyone plays on Half Life servers, they're playing their newly-fangled TF2 and CS:GO, whatever those are. If you get the Ghostbuster gun, then you are the best player.  Overall: 10/10. Iz rely gud",

Critics have long recognized that the greatest RPG games of all times are Baldur's Gate and Final Fantasy VII, who were not the most famous or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Critics rank the highly controversial Super Mario Bros. 3 over other platform games who were highly popular in courts around the world. FPS critics are still blinded by commercial success: Half-Life sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. RPG critics grow up playing a lot of RPG games of the past, platform critics grow up playing a lot of RPG games of the past. FPS critics are often totally ignorant of the FPS games of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that Half-Life did anything worth of being saved.  Grade: A+",

I highly recommend to play this game on Hard difficulty in order to get the best experience out of it. Playing on Normal Mode was fun but I felt more like an unbeatable super trained veteran marine than like a scientist just trying to survive a catastrophic scenario he accidentaly got thrown into. However, on Hard the Gaming experience changes a lot (positively): - you are very short on ammunition making you think twice weather you simply try to rambo everything with your guns or if you take the (really lethal) risk of trying to kill stuff with your crowbar or if you actually try to sneak past certain enemies - Aliens and Enemies in general HURT (they really do). This actually made me get scared of those Aliens. They might not (considering today's graphics standards) look scary as a 3D-Model but if they are actually able to kill you with ease you start to feel true fear if they suddenly pop up behind a corner you just walked by. - Your playstyle becomes a lot more stealthy and thoughtful. This is actually really realistic. I mean how should a scientist with no combat experience and conditioning apart from maybe having watched the Star Wars Series take out a huge Unit of special Forces together with a bunch of invading aliens if he doesn't try to outsmart and surprise them ? These and some other experiences I gathered are really reasons to play this game on Hard difficulty. I was actually so surprised about how much better the Game felt on Hard that I decided to play all my future games on hard difficulty without beating it on any lower difficulty anymore.  As a result to my 30 hours journey into Half Life 1 I have to state that this is an awesome part of gaming history that everyone who calls himself a gamer should have played.",
