            "review_text": "Frustration deluxe.  Ok so the game and concept is simple, your character constantly run to the right and you have to slide, jump, kick, bounce, reflect or any of these combinations together to get to the end of the level. The music that plays in the background helps you keep the pace somewhat and you can probably blindfold this game if you memorize it completely.  But the bad thing about the game, is that you have one try.  If you fail in any way, you will start at the beginning of the level. The first few levels are easy, but the further in you get into a chapter, the levels get both longer and more complicated, some lasting up to 4-5 minutes. So the game turns into a game or memorizing every little thing, you have to remember which buttons to press and for how long to press them as well, some things you get barely no warning of at all so the first time you get there, you will die.  Fun.  So the game itself is pretty fun, except the lack of checkpoints, which makes it extremely frustrating instead.  Graphics: It’s pretty if you like this 3d-pixel environment. It works well I think. :) Things kind of tend to blur together at times, but might be intentional to make it harder.  Technically I had no real hiccups, though I experienced some light lags at times, but think it might be my computer instead of the game. 99% of the time it was smooth sailing.  So should you buy this? Well, I don’t know, some might like this a lot, perfecting levels is a wonderful feeling, but if you are forced to perfect them… Well, it just sucks the fun out of a game. If you don’t mind this, then you should probably buy it. It is a good game in the bottom, but the frustrating stuff really tended to get in the way for me.",

There's 3 worlds and there's a handful of levels in each so it has enough content in it.  Unfortuantely, I just didn't think the game was great. One mistake and allllll the way back to the start. Its a difficult game, but its difficulty isn't something it should be proud of like SMB is. Its just a memorization test. Trial and error nonstop. Memorizing certain patterns. I don't find that very entertaining.  I felt like this game was just wasted potential. They should of made it more about score and less about memorizing hard patterns. It also would of benefited from less linear gameplay with multiple paths to choose from.  Fortunately, not only does the sequel do that but it also adds checkpoints. Its better in many other ways as well. I suggest you skip this one and play Runner 2 instead. ",

I am glad I tried it out, it's a simple game, you have a few commands, jump, kick, slide - what makes the game fun and not just some lame jump side scroll is the perpetual movement, mixed with positive reinforcement with sound activated moments upon collecting certain items. This is an awesome tablet or phone game as well, easy to pick up and let go, overall I love BIT TRIP and it's become a staple game for steam for me.   What I didn't like about the game: The game is not easy, this isn't a bad thing - it just gets frustrating, so if you get frustrated easily this game is not for you.   Would I buy at current asking price of 9.99? It's cuyrrently on sale for .99 cents, which is normally is on sale or found in bundles.
