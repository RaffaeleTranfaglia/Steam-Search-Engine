            "review_text": "Excellent game!!   The combat and dynamics are even better than the much newer Blitzkrieg 2 game.  Heres what i love about this game:  - USSR missions where if you retreat you are shot at by NKVD Anti-Desertion squads, NOT ONE STEP BACKWARDS COMRADS!  - artillery has actual real ranges, mortars can hit targets across the map. In BK 2, mortars and artillery can barely fire longer than a few 100 feet.  - infantry can ride on tanks!! I love this aspect of the game because its such as small feature but makes the game feel so immersive  - a large variety of tanks and armored vehicles.   There are like 10 different versions of the German Pz. III, ranging from commander versions with special radio equipment on the sides and a tank commander actually visable on top. Some tanks will have ammunition boxes on the back and sides while others have Nazi flags! The detail in this game is just great.  - infantry are actually useful and aren't just slaughtered. They can survive a few hits and can fire at targets from a reasonable range.   - Each mission is highly detailed with plenty of scripted events like suprise counter attacks and enemy air strikes. BK 2 and Cuban Missile Crisis: The Aftermath suffer from the same missions played over and over again.  Besides being sorta old, the game has no real drawbacks from what ive played so far. Both the Russian and German campaigns are highly detailed and give intense missions. Best $5 ive ever spent on steam!!",

            "review_text": "I'm happy to see Stalingrad finally made it to steam, but i forgot how useless the infantry was, i almost never got the use the damn soldiers, i kept yelling MOVE UP DAMMIT, but instead they decided to just lay down and not use any type of cover, even though i got my tanks to pound the entrenched areas, so i decided to just leave my infantry behind and just take all my tanks up and destroy the anti-tank guns in groups, the damn tanks are more useful against enemy infantry than infantry vs infantry.  But because this is getting a bit old, and it still works and the textures looks great.  Approved.",

            "review_text": "It is a great game for low money. Made for Blitzkrieg Vets. Watch out for the 'Achtung Panzer!' Mod, its still the best Blitzkrieg-Version  Pros - great atmosphere (generals new generals, officers, tank officers (which ha a huge viewdistance) - a lot of positive gamechanges (Inf. can eat more DMG, units got more range, thats just two examples)  - its wired but nice to have a rock-soundtrack during the game.  - Lots of Missions - nice balancing, germans have to fight with low supplys, they got smaller but stronger and better equiped Inf. carried by various 'sdkfz'. The USSR got poor soldiers by foot, small / old tanks / old trucks, but they have a lot of them most of the time.  Cons - the difficulty is wired, the first 8 Missions on each side are way to easy and missions are becoming nearly insane at the mid-game. Problem isnt that they are to hard, they are becoming a little bit unfair. - the maps of each mission are very huge, but quiet empty.  ",
