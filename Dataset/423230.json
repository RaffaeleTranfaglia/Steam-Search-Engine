            "review_text": "I believe that I am relatively high skilled across many games and genres. Games such as Dark Souls, XCOM, Alien: Isolation, Ori and the Blind Forest are some of the titles I have beaten. These are games that are renown for their difficulty. They are games that I have devoured in spite of a tendency of rage quitting from time to time. Aside from difficulty. it seems like they all have something in common. They are fair. As a result, for a game to have a basis to be judged positively upon its difficulty there must be fairness. A poorly programmed and developed game cannot be labeled 'difficult' if it is because the RNG is impossible or the computer cheats. All of the great 'difficult' games have this in common.  Every time that I received damage and an ultimate death in Furi I knew I had made a mistake. The mistake that I had made was obvious the moment that it was committed. I was never left to second guess what I had done incorrectly or question the AI. As a result, I also realized that the game is so impeccably programmed that I know that it rewards on the attributes that matter most. Players must have the patience, concentration and the skill in order to succeed. Anything less at any moment in time and I knew that I would be punished.  It is because of this that I can claim that Furi is genuinely difficult and not for illegitimate means.   Boss Encounters",

            "review_text": "Intense arcade game that blends genres like top down action, twin stick shooter and bullet hell into one stylish package.    Furi  is built around the best parts of any game - the boss fights. There are no fillers here: no faceless henchmen, no long platform segments and cutscenes prolonging your way to the ten unique boss characters the player is meant to overcome.   You'd think that such a game might be over in an hour or two, but  Furi  is freakishly hard in an oldschool kind of way. Each fight consists of multiple phases which get increasingly harder, demanding for the player to master every tool at his disposal. Most often, the key to success is learning your enemy's attack patterns. You will rarely nail them during the first encounter, so expect to die. Horribly. And most of all, repeatedly.  My only gripe is that certain attack phases are significantly harder than others and often they are located at the end of a long six phase battle, meaning you will have to redo the entire battle several times until you have the pattern down, which can be a little discouraging. Apart from that,  Furi  is an absolute delight from start to finish.  Straight up gucci, baybeh!",

            "review_text": "A short but awesome game that takes inspiration from bullet hells, boss rushes and character action games. All though it's not the best in any of those individual genres, it strikes a very nice balance of them and the developers shows that they are competent enough to satisfy fans of the genres.   The biggest strengths of this game is the robust gameplay that is simple in design but is utilized very well and its varity in boss fights which always keeps you guessing for what's up next like shadow of the colossus did.   Also the game is eye candy for the right reasons this time, no special effects or anything that will wow you but rather artstyle, character designs and best of all the very cool looking bosses. This to me shows that the developers and artists knows what matters the most when designing a video game which I really admire and respect.    The weak spots of it are the walking sections, I totally get why the developers put them there but it feels like forced down time, it would have been more interesting if the player was alowed to run to the next boss if they wanted to (on the first playthrough) and the ability to explore the areas inbetween at their own pace.  The other thing that kind of puts this below other character action games is how the parrying works, not that it's broken because it tecnically works as intended. But rather how you read your enemy in a fight, you don't learn the moveset to parry you'll look at the light and the sound que. This makes parrying very easy unfortunately which can break the bosses that relies on close combat.  Even though I wouldn't put this up aginst the top tier action games I can say with confidence that this beats everything that is considered the next best and I'm very excited for this teams next game. We need more top tier action games on pc and this was the closest we have that isn't from capcom or platinum.    If you like character action games then this should be in your library, not only because it's very good but also to support a team with great potential.",

            "review_text": "Furi. This is one hack and slash fighting game that I have been looking forward to, with one-on-one combat with multiple tier battles, this game blew me away when I started to play.  This game immediately throws you into the action with your first enemy/boss and as much as hack and slash is like 100% ingrained in us all, dodging, guard breaking and parrying are key in helping you defeat your enemy! It builds you up to a peak when you feel like a god, until of course the enemy pulls a rabbit out of his hat and baboom, you now have to think of a new way to avoid their attacks and get them with your own.  The amount of skill, timing and patience you need for this game is paramount, I would rank this harder than Dark Souls. Like, all of the Dark Souls games.  With that being said, even with a few hours under my belt, I enjoy this game so much. The soundtrack is fantastic, the visual art is amazing and the difficulty is right up my alley, making button mashing just useless.  Solid 10/10.",

            "review_text": "Fast, frantic, demanding, stressful, technical and brutal are just a few words that perfectly describe the game Furi.  The story is great, at first it might seem very generic with you being some guy in 'jail' wanting to escape. But as you progress through the game the story is told to you in a narrative between fights by the same man who freed you at the start of the game. You'll find out more about the upcoming guardian, why you were imprisoned to begin with and what the man helping you really wants.  This is a boss rush game with high-octane encounters mixing in both bullet hell and hack n' slash gameplay seamlessly; so if you're not used to either of those styles of play you're in for a difficult start. What does set this game apart from the rest is the fact that there is no leveling up or finding new equipment, your reward for beating an encounter is absolutely nothing; there aren't any flashy animations that play saying 'congratulations you beat the fight!' but you do get brief moments of rest as you mentally prepare for your next encounter. Because there are no unlockable items or moves the player has full control over everything the game has to offer from the very beginning. Now you might be thinking 'But if I have everything what's the point?' well the point is mastering the combat system, the game tells you very little aside from how to charge your attacks and parry the rest is up to you to discover.  As far as this game's content goes you don't have to worry if you're someone who strives to improve and really wants to understand all the technicalities and nuances of the gameplay. Straight away you'll only have access to story mode, once you beat it you'll unlock a new more challenging difficulty as well as two new game modes; Practice and Speedrun. Practice mode is just as the name suggests, practicing each encounter of the game and it also gives you a letter grade at the end based on your performance; and Speedrun mode is all encounters one after the other with a catch, if you game over once you fail and have to start back at the very beginning.  This game's controls are extremely tight and responsive, which they should be since it demands twitch reactions from the player. You can use either mouse &amp; keyboard or a controller; both work perfectly.  Now this game's soundtrack is outstanding, honestly not purchasing the soundtrack with the game is an injustice but that's just my opinion. They got Carpenter Brut, Scattle, Waveshaper and so many other great artists to create tracks for this game.  Graphically don't even get me started, the world around you is beautiful as you walk to each guardian and the character design is flawless. The creator of Afro Samurai, Takashi Okazaki designed each guardian so if you feel like the game reminds you of Afro Samurai it's probably because of his style.  I very highly recommend a purchase but only if you'd classify yourself as someone who enjoys improving and perfecting your gameplay because the game's story mode isn't that long, you can beat it anywhere between 2~5 hours. If you don't think you're that person but the game interests you then definitely pick this up when it goes on sale, you will not be disappointed.",

If you pick up the 'normal' difficulty even the tutorial boss is challenging, I'm currently at the second one and didn't beat it yet. The graphic style, first off, isn't stunning and looks a bit retro but it shines by the fact that it can run on all machines [My laptop is like 5years old and no fps drops] and it keeps the game minimalistic and clear during the fights themselves, because Oh Boy, you need to be able to constantly be able to tell what's happening.  The Music is electro, nothing too fancy but far from being bad aswell, I'll probably listen to it again some times later but I won't deem it a golden medal EDIT - Wtf the compositors are far from bein' people I dislike, I'll have to listen to it more [ CARPENTER BRUT, DANGER, THE TOXIC AVENGER, LORN, SCATTLE, WAVESHAPER and KN1GHT! ]  The Fights themselves, pretty basic keybinds on your side and no real combo unlockable, everything in this game is about how quickly you can learn a boss pattern and adapt yourself to it, also the capacity to dodge 150 bajilion bullets and aoe effects aimed at you, with the parry button timing to ripost perfectly  It's forgiving, you can loose half your life in a phase without problem and fully regen after it and you can afford the mistake buuuuuuuuuuuuuuut even if it's not a punishing game asking you to dodge at the right pixel [Or does it?] it remains difficult in it's real own right  I already sinked probably one hour in it and the return to reality feels weird, you got stuck to these vibrants teal and magenta colors, the Ost, the boss moves, everything is screaming at you to go back for more, because, in the end, even if separately the pieces aren't perfect [Except for the fight probably, but I'd like a keybind remaping option for the controler] the mix itself is an alchemist's masterpiece.  The ost ends up not making you get a headache and is a really good background theme when you're in the middle of the fight, the game environement is clean and bright, appealing without nuking your eyelids and to finish, the controls are responsive.  Get it, now. It's an experience you need to have for yourself instead of watching a let's player or a twitch people dude streaming that.",

It’s like a club banger Tron meets Dark Souls graphics + Playstation smoothness Donnie Darko rabbit was exciting to see and hear Jailer reminded me of a quintasont(sp?) from the Transformers cartoon movies ------- Beat first boss - RELIEF!  About ¾ of the way through the first boss I started working into a groove, and it was very enjoyable. The good moments are very good, and feel rewarding. The failures are all your own.  Dodging felt slow for a game that rewards good gameplay and fast paced action. Dialog is a LITTLE janky and disjoined, but the story that it tells is actually very immersive for being so minimalistic. Moving to the second stage ilicited a big “Hell yea” from me internally. Woah, the rabbit on the loading screen makes sense now. The bubblegum colors are just beautiful  --------------------  Second boss is FUN, and it made me feel like I was beginning to understand the game.

First things first, if you are expecting a game filled with exploration, heavy dialogue and memorable characters, this game may not be for you.   If you are looking for heart pounding action, bullet hell, well timed parrying and truly memorable fights, then you came to the right spot.  I cleared this in one sitting, I think clocking around 4hrs after completion. That was with zero deaths up to the last part of the game which proved to be a little difficult. This game is fairly challenging and will force you to think a little on your feet, but once you figure out each boss's strategy there is truly no greater feeling then slaying them after all that hard work.  I feel that is what Furi trys to do, is capture the essence of combat and the high you can get as a player from giving it your all. There is a story here but it does take time to flesh out. A lot of people didn't care for the auto-walking scenes but honestly there a nice build up to the next fight. The dialogue, the subtle music, and the beautfiul designed backgrounds are a great time for you as the player to take a breather and really take in the game.   Ideally if you like games like MGS: Revengence, No More Heroes, or Nier, I think this game is for you.",

They will really put you to the test and not to mention the hardest difficulty is super hard.  The only thing that I think a lot of people will not like is the sequences between the boss fights. Because that will be you walking really slowly to the next boss with a 'sidekick' doing something narration which I really enjoyed.

If you're the type of person that wants to just beat a game once and move on, the length may not be worth the full price tag.  The Good: The amazing soundrack, which was the first thing that interested me in the game. Responsive combat and controls. I used a controller, so I can't speak for KB/Mouse. Boss design, and in general, the all around art design of the game.  The challenge - Boss fights felt very rewarding, and none of them ever became too frustrating.  Neutral: The story - It got more interesting towards the end of the game, but I ultimately wasn't invested in the characters or world.  The Bad: The walking 'cutscenes' in between fights - I usually like to explore when given the opportunity, but in Furi I just hit the auto-walk button and wait until the next boss. Sure, It works for delivering the story and giving you a moment to rest. You also get to listen to another amazing song from the OST, but it discouraged me from exploring and getting extra dialog.",

Then unexpectedly getting to play the game at Pax East and chat with dev Emeric Thoa further increased my excitement.  Actually playing the game has completely smashed my expectations. This game is the most hard driving, heart pounding, badass feeling game with the best soundtrack since Hotline Miami. I'm not typically good at bullet hell games but with by learning how the stranger moves and what his abilities are, anyone can get good at the game, but it takes a while to master. The battles are quite a challenge, but like the controls once you learn the enemy you're fighting, you can deal some serious blows in a badass manner.  The lulls between matches work wonderfully for both storytelling and cooldown. My one gripe is with the controls during those lulls but pressing A has you automove and lets you really take in these beatiful environments and soundtrack they have created.  All in all I absolutely love this game, and cannot wait to see what The Game Bakers have in store next.",

Hard and straightforward like any old arcade game but with an amazin artistic direction, from the soundtrack to the voice, the visual graphics and even the story (it needs to be played until the end to get the whole picture). My only regret was to not have a choice about ending each fight by a death sentence or not, however it makes a lot more sense at the game since the whole story and character is built on it (I won't spoil more). If you are a very hardcore player and what to struggle a lot, the highest difficult level will be the challenge you are looking for, beleive me. Speedrun elements are also included in the game which is very much appreciated. The Game Bakers managed to produce a quite unique game everyone should try if you enjoy arcade games or boss fight situation (since this is only about it!).",

I like it because I don't feel like all of the best parts of the best games without everything else.  You my find the story boring or intriguing based on what types of story's you like. The story is deliberately very vague but if you listen closely it's all there. It just requires some deductions on your part.

This game is legendary. The gameplay involves only boss battles (and the various build-up walking sections) and thus is very centered on the gameplay element. Your character has moves such as dashing and parrying, hacking and slashing, shooting and strafing, and an extra surprise should the player find the secret at the very end. These gameplay mechanics make the bosses fast, intense, and suspenseful; I can guarantee that one will end up holding their breath throughout most of the boss fights (especially mid-late ones). Each boss fight is memorable, presenting unique fighting styles that force the player to adapt to more techniques than simply hacking away with their katana-esque weapon.  The art style is gorgous; designed by the artist behind Afro Samurai, the character art doesn't dissapoint, each one having an individual look, paralleling their fighting style. The environmental art is astounding as well, with its vivid colors and cool imagery. Added on top of all this, the music, composed by a small group of famous musicians, perfectly blends with the game's visual flair and charisma, and makes the fighting feel almost nostalgic, in a way, as if one was playing an old arcade game.

All the bosses have their own unique mechanics, from a sniper that can turn invisible to a sword and shield wielding knight who can block most projectile attacks. Many of the bosses initially seem impossible to beat, but once you understand their different movesets and phases you'll be wrecking them in no time.
