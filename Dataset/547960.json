            "review_text": "Pro: +Maybe the music; it's decent at least for this kind of game. +Relatively easy unlock of achivements;  Cons: - Buggy, unoptimized; - Locked in full screen &amp; no option to turn down the volume if you would prefer so; - There's 2 game modes but they're the same, only in one you waste more time proceeding (and I assume you play the levels in an order), while in the other you get to select the level; - You get weapons and power ups and don't even know what they do; - Your hit boxes are too big and unfair, enemies kill you from not even touching you; - The shield you get is useless, makes no difference whatsoever (well it spares you from death once but the hitboxes issue mentioned above makes you just wanna die without shield, anyway).  As it stands, it's not worth 1 $ / eur. as of now (yea I know, right ?), not only because of the cons. it comes with, but because for the same price you get a -way- better indie game experience, if you look enough in the Store. Or possibly add a bit more money and get a real game of the kind *cough*  Crimsonland  *cough* via trading or from a sale.",
