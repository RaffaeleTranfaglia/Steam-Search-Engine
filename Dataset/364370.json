            "review_text": "This game showed so much promise. It had a terrific premise, and a pretty decent plot to go with it. Gameplay mechanics were relatively sound and I would have enjoyed it.   WOULD HAVE being the main point in that sentence. The game has a striking lack of save points and when I say lack of, I mean that there's just ONE save point. ONE.   Generally, a lack of save points doesn't condemn a game to being unplayable. However, when faced with events like the Gauntlet, where multiple deaths are unavoidable, this becomes a major problem. Particularly when the Gauntlet is obviously meant to be a trial-and-error point of the game, meaning you are MEANT to die. The only save point in the game is a good 1-2 minute journey from the Gauntlet.   TL:DR, if you don't enjoy leaving running back and forth between a save point and an almost inevitable death multiple times, don't get this game. I finished it once and I don't intend on playing it again.",
