            "review_text": "Dokuro is a puzzle platformer released for the Vita and iOS, and is now on Steam. It's made by Game Arts, the people behind the Grandia and Lunar series. They're actually working on porting Grandia II to Steam right now, and if you like JRPGs I'd buy it when they finish, as I've heard it's very good. And if you like puzzle platformers you should get Dokuro, as it's a great game in that genre too.  The story is set in a non-descript fantasy kingdom, where the Dark Lord has just kidnapped the local Princess. With no hero around to stop him, it seems she's destined to a forced marriage - until the titular Dokuro, a lowly skeletal mook, decides she's a bit easier on the eyes than his current boss. He's sure to get more respect as a hero than his current position, right?  Well, no. After releasing the Princess he's dismayed to find out not only is she not thanking him, she doesn't even notice he exists, literally. It's up to him and the player to change that by helping her get out of the castle, but it's a long way to the entrance.  The basic gameplay is that of an escort mission. Each level is one room of an area of the castle, such as the ballroom or kitchen, with a flower at the end. You need to get both Dokuro and the Princess to that flower alive, which isn't as easy as it sounds. Dokuro can jump over obstacles and defend himself, but she can't, and what's worse, her not noticing him means she'll gladly blunder into danger. Monsters will make her turn and run, but with hazards she can and will die. Thus most levels are based around making a safe path from point A to B for her to follow.  Dokuro has a few tricks to help with this, such as different kinds of chalk, befitting the game's graphical motif, that can create ropes to fix pulleys, light fires, or other effects. Early on he also gets a potion that lets him transform into a prince form, where he can pick up and carry the princess to get her away from danger or down ledges, as well as defeat monsters more easily. Almost all the levels feel well-designed, and while there are some hard ones it never gets to the point of being frustrating. Dokuro controls well, and it doesn't require pixel perfect movement.  The game looks quite nice, and the story, while simple, makes you care about since Dokuro is a believable underdog. It's also decently long: I think I'm only about halfway through it at the time of this review. If you were wary because of the Mixed review status, don't be: most of the negative ones aren't talking about the actual game, just that it lacks options that are unnecessary to enjoy it. I hope my review helps convince you it's worth your time, because it definitely is.",
