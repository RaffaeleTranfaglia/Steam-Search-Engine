            "review_text": "AdvertCity is a dystopian tycoon game in which your goal is to make money by advertising, expand your operations, and eventually buy out every megacorp in the city. I have played many tycoon games in the past such as zoo tycoon, school tycoon, mall tycoon, but nothing like this. It's a very unique spin on the usual genre.  Pros: Gives a great sense of atmosphere  Procedurally generated city (can pick seed number) Great soundtrack  Cons: Can be overwhelming at first Tutorial could be better  At first this game may overwhelm you with lots of information The numbers seem big (this game uses a cryptocurrency) and the tutorial does not explain everything, so you will have to do some learning on your own. After putting some time into the game, it becomes enjoyable as you begin to buy new buildings, hiring more workers, or firing them if your running out of money. Your actions feel impactful and if done correctly could bring you one step closer to buying out the competition.",

            "review_text": "i think it not worth buying.  the game idea is kind of nice, but the game itself is to bad to be any good.  The most problems i think is the horrible interface which makes the game nearly unplayable. the font of the whole interface burns in the eyes after a few minutes. the game itself playes quiet boring, click click click submenu click click... over and over again. the logic of putting adverts anywhere is kind playing dart with kinds. it will score or not, will be good or not,...no strategic needs This game is not worth naming a tycoon game. beside the fact there are 'megacorporations' there is absolut no tycoon element. no statistics, no strategy needs, only senseless clicking on the same damn adverts again and again on the same places and you won. after a while you got 'upgrades' what only is a new textline in the adverts-menu and you start clicking again. new spot same logic... realy loveless design...",
