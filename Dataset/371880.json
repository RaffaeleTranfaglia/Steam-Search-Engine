            "review_text": " Collider is a fantastic party game with single player, local co-op and local competitive modes, which is a lot more addictive than expected.   There are five game modes in total out of which three can be played single player. All five of them can support up to 8 players so have your controllers and friends ready! The game modes vary nicely and I found each one to be very enjoyable. Collider is very much a time-burner. Once you start playing you don't realise just how long has passed until you stop. I found myself constantly thinking 'Okay, just one more round' then playing for another ten minutes.  The co-op part of the game is where it really gets fun though. It's really awesome to work with and compete against your friends. I found single player to be rather relaxing whereas co-op was the complete opposite; we all found our competitive sides coming out. We ended up playing for around 45 minutes when we only planned to play one round of each mode. I think local co-op is often under appreciated these days and I'm glad there are still games like this that understand some people just want to play with one copy of a game on one device. There is a lot of re-playability due to this and it doesn't run the risk of having no-one online like so many multiplayer games end up with.  The gameplay itself is great, the game runs fine with no issues and the controls work perfectly when using a controller like recommended. You can still use a keyboard but I found it a lot harder and not as enjoyable. The graphics are very nice yet simple, though I feel this works in favour, everything is beautiful yet there isn't too much going on.  There are a few tiny, tiny gripes so far I have with the game but nothing that stops me from playing. My first is the distinct lack of a pause feature. Now I know games like this don't require one but when I'm playing and I've gotten pretty far in a mode and have no choice but to die to take an urgent phone call it sucks. Secondly some options would be nice so you are able to adjust sensitivity and volume.   Also I was hoping to 100% this but I feel the 'That's a paddling' achievement is out of reach as it requires owning at least 7 controllers which i'm sure very very few people have  . Lastly there could be some form of tutorial or explanation to each game mode (I didn't realise I could shoot until reading an achievement and even then it took me pressing every button to find it out). The last two the developers have said they are working on though which is great and shows that the developers do listen which is rare.   All in all Collider is fun, both alone and with friends, and is one of those games that if you have a few friends and some time to spare it's definitely worth trying. ",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: The copy of this game was provided by the developer for review purposes.  Collider is a great local multiplayer game that is a lot of fun to play with friends. Each game is quick and exciting leaving you wanting to play again and again. It is a good value for the money for anyone who likes to get together with friends for some quick action.   Pros: 5 very unique game modes that provide a good mix of competitive and cooperative play. Excellent controls; smooth and responsive. Great variety of music and backgrounds. Unique and fitting game mode selection screen. Fast and engaging.  Cons: Local multiplayer only; sometimes it's hard to get 6+ people in the same room at the same time. Local multiplayer can be difficult huddled around a small screen. No option for NPC players; It would be nice to play with 'friends' even when you dont have any. Very challenging with mouse/keyboard; Make sure you can support multiple gamepads. No options; Would like to see basic options for windowed mode, music/background selection, etc.",

Also Arc wars. Because everyone is a jerk, but only two people can shoot at you at once, so you've got that going for you, so that's great.  So, uh, yeah. Play this jam.",
