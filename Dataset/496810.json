Now the cons. -Uncomfortable camera. And perhaps all I am mostly satisfied with the game. Why I'm not talking about the graphics?Just because I don't like to judge a game because of the graphics,for me gameplay is important. My rating 9/10.",

            "review_text": "*sigh* You know I am actually a huge fan of the Hyperdimension series, even the spin-offs like Hyperdimension U: Action Unleashed were great! And I kind of hoped, that Blanc+Neptune vs Zombies would be equally as good as Action Unleashed, especially giving the great ratings it got and the similar looking gameplay. Honestly I dont understand why many people say its so great, it is in fact very disappointing. Barely any unlockables or game modes, outfits are only color swaps most of the time and the story is... painfully cheesy, doe that one is intended so it makes it quiet funny. I will summerize the Pro and Cons for a better overview.  Pro:  - Full Hyperdimension Neptune cast - Colorful and funny dialogues like in the other games - A tiny bit of fan service - Cheesy as heck, but still very enjoyable - Co-op mode  Cons: - Barely any unlockables - Short story, without much content - Not able to restart levels - Characters control like tanks, go down in a few hits doe - Sooooooooooooo many Looooaaaaaadiiiiiiing screeeeeeeeeeeeens - Locking onto enemies is weirdly difficult - Characters are unable to move when hit or untill their move animation is over (like swinging the weapon),   making them a very easy target - Transforming in battle or leveling up makes almost no difference when fighting - Bulletsponge enemies - Unlockable outfits only color swaps most of the time  Overall rating from my side: 5/10  If you are a fan of the series and you can find it for like 6 - 10 bucks or so, then get it. It does have funny cringeworthy moments. But if you hope to find the same variety of content or fun like in the other titles, Im afraid you will be disappointed aswell. To everyone new to the franchise: Start with Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth1 or Action Unleashed.",

The game price is acceptable as you can play with your friends in the multiplayer mode up to 4 person. If you do not have close friends in steam don't worry because you can play the multiplayer mode with random people too. The storyline is fine but the length of the story line is abit too short that i finish it within 11-12hrs+ . I have encountered a bug in the multiplayer mode but you can reconnect to the room of the multiplayer mode and it will be fix unless you have encounter it many times. Strongly recommend people to try this game but wait for discount if you find the original cost abit too pricy for you.Hope you all will like it too!",

            "review_text": "I would love to recommend this because I am a big fan of the franchise, but unfortunately I cannot do that, not for the full price at least.  MegaTagmension is a musou style game (like Dynasty Warriors) while the promise and potential is good, the problem is that the whole game consists of very short scenes in which you fight just 1 pack of monsters. The most gameplay you will get in a row is about 3 minutes. This is NOT a game in which you traverse large levels with monster packs, bosses, complete objectives etc. You load the scene, kill 20 mobs, and that's it. I haven't completed it yet, but the whole thing can probably be completed in about 3-4 hours tops. Of course there is some replayability thanks to leveling, lily ranks, treasures gathering and such.  Most of the time is spent in menus and reading dialogue cutscenes, which are funny and interesting as always in the Neptunia games, but when you have to spend 5 minutes reading dialogues to get 2 minutes of action it kind of kills the fun.  If you are a hardcore Neptunia fan, it will still be fun of course. Though I would suggest waiting for a sale. This game just isn't worth 30â‚¬.",

Great cast of characters, and I'm excited to finally have a Nep action game where I can play Uzume, but the camera controls are in a rough place and the gameplay is very anemic. Where I've already put 25 hours into Nep U, I'm not sure I'll break 15 on this. Multiplayer may add some staying power, but it's currently not working reliably.  I'm hoping IFI takes care of business and I'm able to flip this review, but for now, if you don't have either, buy Hyperdimension Neptunia U instead of this game. It plays like this game should, and has much more content.",

Let's get this review out of the way: How did this game came to be you may ask? Simple answer - take Hyperdimesion Neptuina U, give a zombie makeover with a zombie story, add the schoolgirl genre because it wouldn't be Japanese enough right and take everything that made U fun and throw it all away and you get this. A fast paced hack and slash that's quite slow to be honest especially compared to Senran Kagura and Hyperdimension Neptunia U which are much faster paced and are actually fun to play.   The story is about as ordinary as any zombie based story is: the school is infested with zombies(it's actually a play but who's paying attention to this badly written story)and it's up to the Neptunia Cast to stop them(Loose sense of the word). And that's where all the problems begin - the zombie thing has been done to death(pun intended)by the Western World to the point all you need is zombies and BAM! Instant money(coughcough The Walking Dead coughcough). So the makers of this game(must be on something high)thought they can input their ideas into the genre and added the most cliche thing ever: schoolgirls(because it wouldn't be Japanese if it didn't have them). The game has crashing problems when changing the screen size or just changing the screen to full size which is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as hell. The story is a snooze and the shop menu(for buying weapons, why am I telling you this, no idea)doesn't work and does this freezy thing(music plays in the background but you can't see anything!!!)causes a crash where the game sorta hits a freezy moment until you press B(I use a gamepad. Obvious reasons)  They took the one thing that made U slighty more interesting: the clothing break system. Thats bad when you consider it's made by the same people who did U and Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus. Sucks when you think about huh?  Through and through the game isn't as bad as the haters say but it's too far from good like the supporters of the Series say it is. You can definitely find a better game out there, so keep looking and pass on this title.  P:S - I loved Neptunia U and I really wanted to love this one too because I have a love/hate relationship with the Main Series because they're turn-based and I'm not a fan of turn-based combat. But I really can't recommend this even to the diehard fans. If you have to get this game, get it for the PS Vita. You'll thank me by not getting it's crappy PC Port(which seems to be the trend for PC Games made this year: all of them are crappy)  *Breathes out.* Finally. That's over. Peace!",

Crashes. Its very frustrating...sometimes when I DO get a chance to play online I get these weird hair glitches that obstruct my view making io hard to find where the enemies are. Another glitch that is really annoying is the 'Player joined player left' notification that wont go away until you actually leave the room. Other than that the game is really addicting. You can grind to level 99 relatively easy. I will probably update my review as time goes on. I really hope they fix the multiplayer.",

Story mode is ok but honstly i find myself gettimg tired of this one for some reason (story mode i mean) im not sure if its just the silly plot or the fact im playing the game mostly on friday night around midnight as i work all week from 6am till around 4 in the afternoon and then just sleep what time i have off till friday comes..........actually yeah its probably that part   Its a good game but i recommend getting it off ebay and steam is (as always) asking to much even on there so-called sales",
