The feel of whipping an arrow out of my quiver, slapping it on the rest, and drawing back the string all in a fraction of a second is incredibly satisfying! Makes me think I'm a bona fide archery master :)  My friends and I have had a ton of fun switching off and just trying to outdo each other with trick shots in the playground mode. When you attach the spectator camera to the arrow and finally peg that apple out of mid air.... mhmmm, such satisfaction!",

Unfortunately, there's not a lot to it, and even though I really like VR archery I got bored pretty quickly. The devs claimed they were working on an action mode, but now are totally silent on the subject, so there's not much to recommend at present. At least it's cheap.",

            "review_text": "Its a shame that Bowslinger does not provide more variation.  What it does do is get the fundamentals right; the bow mechanics are good. Threre's something about hearing the early stages of The William Tell Overture played too...  It's not that it is a bad game but there are other archery games on VR which provide more of a dynamic challenge.  For now its a thumbs down.",
