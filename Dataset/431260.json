            "review_text": "I was disappointed by this game. There's really no hidden object aspect of this game, despite being tagged as such. The story is ok, but I had to play through it twice to beat it because the game kept getting bugged out during the first run-through. I had gotten stuck and couldn't complete it. Even though I had recovered all of the amulet pieces, the count still showed one missing (though it was there on the map). Very frustrating! After a certain point, my inventory filled up with the amulet pieces -- seriously, what was the point of that? This game's structure is sloppy and still has bugs. It's short and not really all that challenging. I noticed no difference between advanced mode and regular. Granted it didn't cost as much as other HO/PAC games, but you'd be better off spending money on another one.",

            "review_text": "I just finished playing this game. It is not a bad game, but it is NOT a hidden object game. There is not a single hidden object scene in the entire game. There are puzzles and items that you have to find to unlock or open the next area that has more items to find that move you forward, but there are no scenes with a list of items that you have to find. This is strictly a point and click adventure.  I only bought this game because of the 'Hidden Object' tag, as my wife really enjoys HOGS, but no where does the developer claim that it is a hidden object game, just other players adding that tag, so I cannot give the game a negative rating. However, do not buy this game thinking it is a HOG.  If you like getting a perfect game with achievemnents that really are not achievements then you will enjoy this game. There is no skill involved in obtainging a perfect game here.",

Story is mildly compelling, great if you want a quick break from shooters and your kinda into this, but might be sub par by other peoples standards. Also it aint a hidden object game, no idea why its tagged so.  Look, its 5 dollars for 2 hours of interactive chill.  Edit: turns out that in steam's infinite wisdom 'point and click' and 'hidden object' are the same thing. This is like saying all 4X are RTS, WTF steam?",

Also, it is way too short !  Round about 2,5 hours gameplay for € 9,99.  But nevertheless you should have a look at that game (-;",

            "review_text": "3/10 - It's alright but far from great.  I don't want to say it's completely horrible because the story is alright but the gameplay is quite boring. I don't consider this game to be a hidden object game because honestly, there weren't any hidden object puzzle scenes. Sure, you have to find items to use somewhere else but no classic puzzles like you usually see in HOG. With 90 minutes of gameplay it's actually quite short and doesn't really explain why they've decided to add 15 trading cards for this game because you basically have to idle it for 2.5 hours to get the rest of the trading cards you didn't get during the first 1.5 hours it took to beat the game. There's no reason to replay the game either because there is nothing you could've possibly missed nor are the different endings or things to discover that would actually make it worth playing the game multiple times. Personally, I think the game was way too easy and too repetitive in its mechanisms and things you had to do to progress further in the story. A positive aspect is that the achievements are easy to get but other than that there's nothing I've personally really enjoyed about this game. I've played it and I've beat it but I definitely didn't enjoy it. Frankenstein: Master of Death and Dracula's Legacy were a lot better and more entertaining than this game.     Accidently Reviewed",

            "review_text": "Looks like a hidden object game (similar to others from the same developer), but it's actually a casual, simple point &amp; click adventure game. No real inventory puzzles (just 'use this thing on that thing'), but a few minigame puzzles. Decent enough at what it is for a mild recommendation, but only just barely.   I encountered one mildly annoying bug near the end: Part of the game involves collecting parts of an amulet, and as each part is collected, you put it into the appropriate place on the ever-growing amulet, which is kept separate from your inventory. However, at one point there seemed to be an extra part in the world (it was a duplicate of one I already had), and after picking it up, all the other amulet parts re-appeared in my inventory. This didn't break anything, it just cluttered up the inventory with a bunch of now-useless parts. So, like I said: Mildly annoying.  FYI for card hunters: I finished the game after 2.4 hours of play, at which point I'd only gotten half of the card drops. Any remaining play time you see is from letting the game run in the background while I did other stuff, waiting for cards.",

I can't assemble the final piece... and I'm really salty about it. I'm not going to go through 93% of this boring game again just to see the crappy ending.  For the type of game it is, it is somewhat pretty. But it is super straightforward and the puzzles aren't hard at all. Find a thing that goes somewhere super obvious... rinse, repeat.   Don't waste your money even if it is on sale.",
