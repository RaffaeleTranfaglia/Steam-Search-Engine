            "review_text": "Rescue Team: ~~~~~~~~~~~ Rescue Team is a strategy / simulation game.   After devastating weather hits Greenfield Island with full force and is well reported on the news, you are sent to the Island to be part of the rescue effort.  At the start of the game, you will see a map with 3 islands. You will have to achieve all goals per level as fast as you can. Goals can vary from building houses, repairing restaurants, rescuing people (with a boat or helicopter) and getting gems. On some levels you will start with only one worker but do not worry too much because you will be able to add more workers to your team by removing obstacles like trees, rocks or repairing bridges that block their path. It becomes quite challenging when you have several workers to manage.  You will need logs of wood, money and food to be able to remove obstacles or repair buildings and bridges.  If you manage to beat the clock, you will be rewarded with a golden trophy which is worth $10,000. You also have silver and bronze rewards but the money reward is very minimal. Why is it important to get the golden reward, you might ask? Well, you have a mini game in which you repair your own house, and it costs a fair few pesetas to rebuild it.   This game reminds me a little of the first Settler game; just the way it looks.  The graphics are decent.  If you like playing against the clock and figuring out which way is best to achieve a golden trophy and have fun, then give this a game a go!  Positives: ~~~~~~~~   - Fast and Challenging (to beat the clock) - Lots of levels - Game runs well - Trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - No achievements  Fun game to own!  8 /10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

It is very simplistic which is both good and bad. It is pretty easy to figure out how to play but does get repetitive. It would be great if some sort of story was being told as you played.  ",
