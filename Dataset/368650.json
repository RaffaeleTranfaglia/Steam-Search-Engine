    "description": "Trapped in darkness, you must use visualized sound to guide your way through threatening environments. The sounds you create will bounce off obstacles, revealing the shape of the surrounding world. It won't be long before your only way of sensing the world attracts a horrifying evil that devours both sound and souls.",

            "review_text": "Well, I'm a bit stuck on level 29 right now, and given as how there are 80 levels to this game, I highly doubt I will be finishing it. However, conceptually, it is pretty cool, and in practice, the game mechanics work well.   Basically, it is pitch black with the only light coming from sound, which bounces off the walls and objects, thus illuminating your path briefly. Also, your footprints leave a trail. Sadly, the sound also serves to attract an all consuming evil, in the form of red lights. Normal sound is represented by white light, doors (and I guess treaure although I'm not exactly certain how that works) is represented by yellow, and water (the bane of your existence in this game, lol) is blue. Somewhere around level 20, you find rocks which you can throw to distract the all consuming evil, which is especially handy when you also have to cross water (which also slows your movement). Each level basically ends by finding the exit 'doorway' which explodes with white light when you step into it. Oh...and you can also move with stealth, which reduces your sound radius and helps you to sneak through that pesky all consuming evil.  There are some other nuances so far, such as needing to use rocks to break through walls, and certain levels where you cant hide from the all consuming evil and simply have to run for it. The level I am on currently, you have to cross waterways which actually push you into the awaiting evil (I guess this is the waters current).   The game does have full controller support, which is how I play it.  Anyway, I actually think this is a stellar game, and minimalistic perfection in what is essentially a unique puzzle game.  I give this game 8 muffled footsteps out of 10 with the remaining 2 betraying you to the all consuming evil, which I will simply dub as Shoggoth.",

            "review_text": "This experience will stay with you forever.  As the blurb suggests, Dark Echo sees you utilising sound to enable you to visualise your surroundings. The sounds you create ricochet around you in the form of coloured lines. You goal, naturally, is to escape the darkness, and escape whatever the hell is in it with you.  I found the gameplay enjoyable overall. The difficulty curve is just right - with a bit of persistence and some careful planning, navigating the darkness can be fun, sometimes scary, but achieveable for everyone. Controls consist of basic movement, throwing stones for decoys, clapping your hands (with various degrees of strength, depending how long you hold the button down for), and stealth. And you'll probably be using stealth quite a bit.  You have your white, regular soundwaves for normal surfaces, yellow for switches. But the real fun starts with blue and red soundwaves. Blue is for water, which is something you'll want to avoid on account of it being so noisy, and red you'll also want to avoid, on account of it being able to kill you at a touch.   And oh my god, if you die. The first time I died I almost leapt a full metre out of my chair. The death scream is perfect. In fact, most all the sounds are done to perfection. From your echoing footsteps to the sound your hands clapping together, it is very well done.   Dark Echo really is a worthy addition to any gamer's library. While it lacks a story of any sort, it does do everything else right, giving us a new take on fear, exploration and stealth. Even if it doesn't sound like fun to you (I don't imagine how this could be) get this game and give it a try. Price alone is reason enough.",

The puzzles are easy at first, but rapidly get harder, how more levels you play. Its unique and ive never seen a game like that If you are looking for a challanging and relaxing puzzle game, this is you're game!",

            "review_text": "Having bought this on a whim, I'm very pleased with my purchase. Playing it in a darkened room on a dreary night is a must to get the full experience but even without that it's still a neat little puzzle game.   I've had a fair few butt-clenching moments and only two instances where I got frustrated with the game. And that frustration limits itself to a couple of levels with moving walls. They're over quickly enough to not be an issue.  The game is short, so it doesn't overstay its welcome. To be honest, it could just as easily have been a free flash game; but I'm glad it isn't. The developer made a small piece of art here, and fully deserves whatever income the game generates. Which can't be much because it costs next to nothing.  Just buy it and give it a chance. I was pleasantly surprised and I'm willing to bet you will be too.",

            "review_text": "Dark Echo is a minimalistic exploration game. You are shrouded in darkness (or, for the second half of the game, in blinding light), and the only way for you to navigate through the levels is the echos of your footsteps (represented by colored lines which radiate out from where you’re standing). You have the ability to stomp your foot (making louder echoes), walk silently (to avoid alerting enemies to your presence), and throw stones (to make echoes in a remote location to lure enemies away).  The game is very simple; there are only a handful of mechanics. There are red enemies who move towards the last sound they were in range of earing, there are pits of water which slow you down and which make a lot of sound to move through, there are red areas that killed you if you moved into them, there were walls that would collapse when you made a loud sound (opening an area but also attracting enemies), and there were moving blocks which pushed you around.  Mostly, the game worked fairly decently; you are introduced to all the games’ mechanics gradually over the first half of the game, and navigate through a series of increasingly-difficult levels which force you to combine the mechanics in increasingly interesting ways.  While the game was mostly fairly solid, the moving blocks mechanic was probably the most frustrating; while it only appears in a handful of levels, the fact that the pushes are so difficult to see ahead of time is kind of frustrating. Eventually you figure out how they work (for a while, I just thought they were sloped areas that I was skidding down), but at times it felt like the game broke its own rules, such as one level where you had to navigate up little ramps that felt like they actually were sloped areas on the sides of the room.  Mostly, though, the game played very fairly, and even the frustrating levels were mostly quite short. After beating the game, you could hunt back through for treasures, or play through the “light” versions of the levels, where additional enemies were added in to make you play more carefully (as well as the layouts of some of the levels being changed to make them more difficult).  That said, the game is nothing super special; the gameplay isn’t really amazing, but it is decent enough. Ultimately, this is a sort of time-waster game – the sort of thing you’d play while chatting to someone or doing something else, sporadically playing it. It was originally a mobile game, and I suspect it is better suited to that platform simply because of its “play in short bursts” nature.  Still, it is okay, and if you’re looking for something to do between doing other things, it isn’t a bad choice, and goes to show that just because you don’t spend a whole lot on graphics doesn’t mean you can’t make a visually striking game. Just dont' expect it to be anything more than a distraction.",

            "review_text": "Listen, for the price that you pay the game may be worth it.  But from a standpoint of 'whether I would spend my time palying this game' it is not evident. The gimmick of using sound is interesting until like 10 minutes in, where it becomes quite irratating having to hear the constant clatter of sound FX.  Though go right ahead if your looking for 'new' gameplay and something to keep you entertained for less than an hour.",

Hopefully this concept can expand further.  Highly recommend you have headphones and no other audio playing as you cannot adjust the volume in any form for this game. Otherwise you may have a difficult time.  $3 is a good price for it, but could use a bit more content.  -----  Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:  BluePaw's Underrated Games List  Join and/or follow if you wish.",
