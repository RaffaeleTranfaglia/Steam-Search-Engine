            "review_text": "Okay, I just beat the game so it's time for a review. This is one of my favorite genres - Tower Defense. But also extremely actiony which is normally not my cup of tea. At first, I had a love/hate relationship with the game. It's fun but you really have to be on the ball. Each level is made up of grid squares and each weapon or defensive machine you place on the field has a set number of squares it takes up AND a set shape. You can rotate these but often you'll find there's just no room for what you want to whoop dinos with. You really need to place things strategically and as quickly as possible. It took me a bit to get the hang of rotating things and getting them on the field promptly. And also deciding what I should choose to fill those limited grid squares. However, once I got the hang of it, I couldn't stop playing. It's actually not a complex game - it just takes a bit of practice. And making sure that all 3 of your steaks survive a level is often quite a challenge! I don't believe this game is worth 10 bucks but if you find it on sale and you're a tower defense fan, I recommend it.",

            "review_text": "What a fun tower defense game! Nothing groundbreaking mechanically but being forced to plan your tower placement before the level begins is a unique challenge and the different shapes of the towers is the real source of the fun for me. It's definitley easy for the first dozen levels and some of the voice work can be grating after the 30th time. Don't be afraid to snag this game for yourself or any young children who like games like Plants Vs Zombies or Kingdom Rush.",

            "review_text": "It does not take itself seriously, and it is rather fun. The humor is hit and miss, but i get the feeling it may be aiming for a younger audience. Unlike most TD this one is perfectly suited for childrens as there is no real violence or even gore. The games otherwise play well with a decent choice of towers and the rare mechanic of controlling a main character who also count as a mobile tower on it's own, a bit like Anomaly. If you are a big TD fan it's worth a try at least, but do expect a simpler friendly game.  -Lost",

            "review_text": "Cute tower defense, Go Home Dinosaurs! has the basics for this specific kind of game. You have to build towers in order to defeat waves of dinosaurs that are following a path, plus you have access to special powers to help you deal with them. But there is nothing more than that : you cannot upgrade your towers, you cannot not move them (so be carefull while placing them), there is no survival mode ... The only special feature is that you (you are a marmot) can move from a place to an other one freely, so that you can shoot the dinosaurs almost everywhere, even if there is no tower. You will need an empty space in order to do that.  It seems that the developers wanted to create a cute and easy game. If you are okay with that, then this game will be fine for you. It is definitely entertaining, and you will have to spend around 10 hours to complete the game (3 worlds, 60 levels total) and unlock all of the achievements (you will need to grind a little bit for the last one, 'Kill 10.000 dinosaurs').  Defend your BBQ!",

It's a mix of Tetris and Tower Defense and while there is no leveling up your towers or even selling your towers for that matter, this game comes off as strategic and enjoyable. I liked it and while it isn't the best tower defense game out there, it is easily worth the cost it is asking for. If you haven't played this yet, fire it up. It'll take you 3 hours max to beat and if you are a player who plays in small increments (get a few games in while dinner is on, in-between work, whatever), play this. It's good.",

It's main feature for making it so fun is that the towers have different shapes. You have to plan both what type of attacks and how many towers you want to bring to the fight, and how to make the towers fit in the space you have available on the map. There is also a shop and your builder can attack. It's a casual, very enjoyable game.",

I had a lot of fun playing through all the levels in this game and finished it after a few weeks of playing it. You can have a meat or a veggie bbq with your gopher friends. Dinosaurs seem to want to eat your food so they come in to invade. You need to figure out the best way to beat them by setting up the board with attacks in hopes that they won't take your food. I loved it. My boys love it. Definitely a great family game!",

There are loads of different unit types to use and tons of purchaseable powerups as well. This game is a bit more difficult than PvZ, because each level gives you a rating, and getting the best rating on all 60 levels is/will be very hard to do. Bottom line, if you like strategy games, or tower defense games, or dinosaurs, or steam trading cards, it's tough to go wrong with Go Home Dinosaurs!

            "review_text": "Starting this review by saying I'm sure this is a game made for mobile devices. It's an adept time-killer for short burst play and there's a large pause button in the top left of the screen.  For a quick synopsis of the plot itself, you're one gopher in a large clan of gophers and you're having a barbecue. Your neighboring dinosaurs weren't invited this time so they've decided to simply crash the party. This turns the encounter into a tower defense scenario where you and your fellows do what you can to protect long hordes of dinos from eating your food.  The method is a bit different from other TD games in that the 'towers' you place are shaped a bit like Tetris/puzzle pieces, so there's some fun behind where you place your gopher pals along the track the dinos use to reach the grill.  Dinosaurs! is pretty enjoyable and cute. The voices from the towers you place (all of them some kind of device staffed by one or more gophers) become grating toward the end of the game, and there are strange spikes in difficulty if you dedicate yourself to only one technique to win. You'll find a few towers function much better than others but don't let that stop you from trying every one.  I bought this in a sale bundle and spent a little over a dollar on it, and got more than my money's worth. If you like the tower defense genre and don't mind colorful games or   LOTS OF   gopher puns, get it here or toss it on your phone/tablet.",
