            "review_text": "After my joke review, here is the real one. AvP 2010 is very underrated in my opinion, only problem with it nowadays is the lack of people in multiplayer, which you can run into Hackers since there is no VAC protection, I recommend getting some friends to play this with you. You can play as 3 characters/classes: Predator and Alien obviously, but also marine, here is their playstyles. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Predator: Think of him as a strategic hunter, you have a choice of 4 weapons that are scatted around the area, he also has 3 visions:Normal, Alien, and Thermal. Alien helps you see aliens which will be highlighted in Green, and thermal helps catch other Predators, but here are his list of weapons: 1. Plasma Caster, a weapon that tracks down your target almost like an aimbot, but it's easy to avoid as an Alien. 2.Smart Disc, a projectile you can control, 1 hits Aliens if it hits their head. Also stuns. 3. Spear, a projectile that while is hard to hit is a 1 hit kill guaranteed. 4. Mines, as the name implies, THEY'RE MINES. If you can track your enemies movement patterns, you can lay these in areas they might go in. As they are hard to see unless you are another Predator. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alien: He is hard to see in the Dark and his tail whips are a vicious weapon, especially if used on the walls. With Alien, you want to stay on the walls as much as possible, never stop moving either since this makes you an easy target, as Aliens have extremely low health, but high kill potential. The Aliens best move would be his Heavy attack since it stuns longer than the predators does. Aliens can't fight Predators alone, that is a death wish, get another Alien pal to help you take one down, similar to the movies, they like to swarm instead of attack alone, like ants or bees. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marine: If you want to be under constant pressure of hearing Aliens growling and Predators roaring... Marine is for you! But in all honesty, Marine is quite good if you can use him right, he of course uses guns to fight, so here are some of his guns: Pistol: Unlimited Ammo, but very little damage. You most likely will not want to use this. Pulse Rifle:A good, all around weapon. Shotgun:If you like to get in an Alien or Predators face, you can use the shotgun, it's buckshot is extremely powerful and it stuns. Flamethrower:Not used very much, pouring Gasoline can help do extra damage. Sniper Rifle: Almost an insta-kill if headshots, very good. Smart Gun: Can track enemies through walls, has an Aimbot, reduces your weapon slots and speed though.Bad if you are trapped by them, mainly because it can only focus one at a time. But good if you are trying to deal with one at a time. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, that is all I got, this a very fun game I think that should be revived. The graphics are very good, and the gameplay feels nice. Campaigns are fun. My personal rating would be about an: 8.5/10",

            "review_text": "The combat itself is very tense and the aliens will attack you from all sides. Whilst you must keep an eye on your motion tracker it's hard to do so when you are aiming at an alien on the ceiling and can hear the Predator laughing at you and get attacked from behind.  You start out in an industrial complex and the feel and tone of the game are much like Doom 3 as it's very dark and you must rely on your torch (or flashlight if you will) although there are some larger inside and outside areas. The game breaks you in gently with movement showing up on your motion scanner but not actually appearing whilst you get accustomed to your range of movement and controls which are standard FPS controls. The sounds are awesome though. A lot of work has been done in this area and all the sound effects from the films are there. The story for each race is fairly short; the Marine probably gets the most out of it all, followed by the Predator &amp; Alien. Each race also plays quite differently due to their differing abilities. The Alien is fast but surprisingly fragile - you must be stealthy at all times; the Marine relies on ranged weapons while the Predator &amp; Alien mostly need to get in close, and so on. All in all, it's an interesting mix and the differences in the storyline are played out quite well. There's also a decent selection of multiplayer modes for all species and a wave-after-wave 'survival' mode for the Marine. ",

            "review_text": "★★★★☆ - 'Worth your time, give it a bash'  PROS: - Design of this game this brilliant and right down to a tee as far as the movies are concerned. - Multiplayer, its a huge part of this game as why I played it back in 2010, its intense and great fun. - 3 parallel single player modes which allow you to play as Marine, Predator and Alien. This means variety as you switch between the three between missions and each have there different abilities and weapons with the Predator particularly having the best mix of weapons including laser, mines, disc and spear. - The marine single player was my favourite, only for the reason that it felt great looking desperately around for Aliens crawling around the walls in the darkness. - Animations, they get repetitive but they look great. - Being able to launch in DirectX11 means that even today the game looks pretty good. - Collectables, if you get really into it theres plenty of things to look for in each story. - The arena fights between the three enemies are pretty fun and there are a couple of decent boss like battles, the one as you play as the Predator against the Queen stands out. - Sound in this game is superb, the calls of the Aliens/Predators, the sound of your rifle and the bleep of your radar.   CONS: - Whilst the 3 stories are parallel the plot is pretty rubbish, I didn't care for it as I was only in for the action and whilst each have there own little endings the environments you reach in stages depend on the timings you play the stories, this means the environments run the risk of being repetitive. - Lack of Marine weapons, there aren't enough and the flamethrower will end up killing you more often than your enemies. No grenades either? Stupid! - Androids, they're tough. Harder to kill than the Alien and even the Predator, a shotgun is there only real weakness. - Alien controls are clunky at times, transition between walls leaves you lost and there aren't really enough types of attack.   VERDICT? By no means the most polished game, nor the best single player but it offers something a bit different and lots of variety in the 3 game styles and a brilliant multiplayer on dedicated servers *cheers wellen1981",

Weapons are as close to sounding, working and feeling as in the films. Great for Nostalgia induced from fandom.  However this game also has a multiplayer which for a game of its age, has decomissioned servers. There are 3-6 active player owned servers but my connection from the Bundus in Namibia is bad and I can rarely play and enjoy some PVP.  Ranking online is near impossible as you make very little xp for hard effor.  My recommendation is: Buy it. WHEN ITS ON SPECIAL. FOR 75%, otherwise don't bother if you are looking for PVP AVP action.",

The single player campaign keeps true to it's predecessors, with a suficiently cativating story to make it worth playing alone. The multiplayer also adds many new game modes (survival co-op being a great plus) that could keep you going for hours without notice.   Changes to the combat system and controls make battles more diverse and bring up the game's pace, in such way it feels not only as a mere update of the late AvP 2, but gives the sensation of a whole new game (as every good sequel should).   The only negative point would come not such from the game itself as from the community. Few weeks after launch, hacks were already common in multiplayer, spoiling much of the fun of online playing with strangers, and little changed as far as the last time I played.   Anyway, if you have a group of friends of any size, the diversity of multiplayer modes makes up for the short commings of cheating players, giving you planty options to serve different numbers of players.  If you like the prequels, or enjoy alternative shooters with original gameplay, fret not, it's worth the money.",

The single-player campaign is very short, 5 missions of varying brevity per faction, and they aren't the best in quality. The controls for the alien, especially if you have the auto-scale-walls option enabled, can take a very long time to get used to. The multiplayer is almost dead - though there are people playing, it's comprised solely of those who have been playing this game non-stop since launch and are therefore much better than you ever will be. If you want to be the allen there really isn't another modern option (Colonial Marines doesn't exist), but if you want to get it, get it cheap. 7.5/10",

            "review_text": "AvP is a really solid game, the single player has 3 parts in which you play as marine,alien and predator while the multiplayer is all the factions versues each other. I love the authenticity this game has the smart cannon feels like what it is and playing the predator is an absolute delight you really feel like youre playing as the predator as you have all the iconoic weapons and gadgets of the predator, the alien feels a bit out place as the controls can be a bit hard but the agility of the alien really makes up for any flaws.  My biggest problem with the game is the developer chose to focus on the mp instead of the sp and the mp is really average at beast, the biggest problem the multiplayer is that the faction with the highest number of people group up and murder you in a few seconds after you spawn and the multiplayer just is not as engaging and fun to play because of that and is mediocre at best.The problem with the sp is that the levels are rehased in all the 3 campaings and there is absolutley no charcaters and the story basically non-existant.The rehased levels are somewhat to be expected but with the verticality of the 3 various races it doesnt feel that painful to go through it once or twice again.  I recommed this game solely on the single player which is bare bones but is good if you want to expeirnce what a great game this could have been instead this is just an abover average game as the devs chose to focus on the multiplayer instead singleplayer, it could have been one of the best games of 2010 instead it wasnt and its a damn shame coz its pretty good.We have tacked on multiplayers in games these days but i wish this was the case here as had the focus been of the main 3 race campagin with a good story and strong characters this woudl have been a much better game.",

            "review_text": "As a single player FPS, this game is about 15 hours of non-stop fun. I'm sure it's even more fun if you're familiar with the three movie series: Alien, Predator and Alien vs. Predator, and their sequels. The game shows a lot of respect for the lore established in those movies and expands a little on it.   The aliens and predators look great. The music and sound effects are spot on. I found it impressive how the storylines of the three campaigns (marine, alien, predator) are nicely interwoven.   As you can imagine, the way to play each campaign is completely different depending on the species you play and their weapons and skills, but each campaign even has a different HUD that really fits the species, which adds to an already immersive experience.   You can adjust the difficulty to fit your play style and your (in)experience with FPS games. You can play the game with a gamepad, but I'm not used to the 'twin stick' thing where one stick moves your character and another stick moves the camera. So I quickly switched to mouse and keyboard, which was a lot smoother for me. You can bind keyboard keys for each species seperately in the options menu.   I haven't tried multiplayer but I gather from other reviews that multiplayer for this game is dead, so if you're looking for a good multiplayer FPS, I suppose you need to look elsewhere. This also means that steam achievement completionists will have a hard time because 12 of the 50 achievements require multiplayer action.  All in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone who reads this because that means you're at least remotely interested in FPS games or in the movies this game is based upon. But since three single player campaigns of about 5 hours each is all you'll get out of it, I would advise against paying full price for the game and instead waiting for it to be on sale.",

If you're not? You'll probably love it even more! This game may seem short, (Perhaps)unoriginal, fast paced, etc. n' such, but by all means! It's not! This game has so much more potential to it than most realize! Now, by saying this, I am of course referring to my OWN opinion - Yours is YOURS and all that.  Come, let's go over a few things;  Graphics;  The graphics ain't the best I've seen for a game released in the year 2010, but nevertheless delivers! The graphics are still astonishing, still incredibly detailed, but in it's own way, own pace, so to speak. It does have it's moment of mind-blow-itis, yes - It does have it's moments of .... Disappointment, but doesn't every game have containment of such? Come on! If you're not sure, then look it up! Youtube, people! Max settings! Gaming on the Pc Friday night with a bag of your favorite chips and some Mountain Dew, curtains closed, doors closed - absolute silence - absolute darkness. Only focus; The game, and surviving it, you'll try- ohoho! If you want a challenge, then put it on Nightmare difficulty and you'll have yourself a nice evening, trying to complete the 3rd level over and over again, thinking of dozens of ways, strategies to complete that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level!.... It's an amazing experience, or at least for me; I enjoy difficulty in my games, but hey, there's always easy, or medium for that sake. Anyway! Back to the matter at hand! The graphics are overall good, nothing too fancy-smanchy, nothing too... Ew. The game itself doesn't require your computer to be top notch - A decent computer will do just fine on high settings! The visuals, environment n' such is what really gives me that 'tip of the iceberg' feeling! Ugh! Amazing! Haha! Now, I've already been writing too much on the topic of graphics alone! I might shorten this down.. another day at another time, hehe...   Gameplay; Ohohoho! Awqh! I can't express it with mere words! You can basically play as all three parts known to the universe! What really amazes me is how every and each campaign has it's own uniqueness! Every campaign felt like a whole different genre overall! In general, yeah, it was all about the same thing, sometimes had to do something that seemed equal as opposed to the other campaigns, but it didn't ruin the expericence! Because with every campaign, you were playing as another 'part'! A.K.A being! *Sigh* Words are so hard to find these days, and people prefer to rather skip the long ones. If you're still here; thanks, I appreciate the time you've used to read this 'review' of sorts. Let's do it like this;  - The Marine; Frightening, thought-provoking, creepy atmosphere (undergoing the section scary, I suppose) , shocks here and there, intriguing, and best of all; Aliens! If you're new, oh... You'll love them little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, ha! The rush you get when shooting them in the head, ah! Wondrous!  The Predator; Bloody, intriguing, thought-provokin- Aw! You know what? F**k this! xD This review is already way too long! My hands hurt and, well, honestly, based on what I've been telling you so far, aren't you the least more tempted to buy this game? It's WELL worth the money. I promise you; even if you're unfamiliar with the whole thing, theme, universe! You won't be bored, you will not be disappointed! I might make this longer as time pass, but right now, I'm beat! It is currently Saturday noon and I'm devastated after yesterday's late night awesomeness, gaming you-know-what. *Wink wink* Okay, I'll stop.  I hope this not even half-done review will make you buy this game, hell! At least consider it!  This is Perspective, signing out! Peace! Long live the queen! (LV-426, that's all I'm saying)  There is so much more to cover, but hey! I did my best in the condition I'm in. *Sigh* I need some re-&gt;zZZzzzz...

No real cons there. Good stories on them all, even if two are left unsaid.  However the multiplayer feels a bit rushed; The predator is easily overpowered givne the high attack speed of their melee, strong heavy attack, at ability to easily run from a fight. Not to say the obvious; but the Plasma a Predator can use is extremely overpowered (One-Shot kill on a non-charged shot)  Playing as the Alien (Xenomorph) is easily the most fun part of this game; the ability to run, jump and climb on any surface at high speeds is a very unique experience (And fun.)  Playing as a Human is aimed more at fast-reaction FPS gamers, forced dim lighting; fairly limited ammunition, and sprinting too long will easily ruin your fun.  Playing as the Predator is essentially playing as a walking tank; Slow-moving, extremely tall, armed with dual blades that will tear you a new one, and a health bar to support a mini-boss battle from Dark Souls. Not to make it sound overpowered; they are easily killed if snuck up on or ambushed.",

I was initially disappointed with some of the level design especially the trees on the swap levels. I was never in love with the single player campaign and though it was strange that you couldnt be the predator or that there were no predator waves on the survival mode. IMHO alien colonial marine has more advanced graphics and single player. But AVP3 is all about the multiplayer, with art inspired by famous AVP comics.",

It holds up well for a 2010 game. the only issue I had with it is the AI, they are so dopey. Aliens would sometimes run around in circles and do predictable patterns, one of the bosses in the predator campaign is a downright joke and with the predator cloak ablity I was getting spotted from far out which didn't make any sense since with the alien you could pretty much sneak up to marines and tickle them. I didn't try the multiplayer due to the fact that it's pretty much died off, and the people left playing are either hackers or badmins according to the forums. (Inb4 someone comments saying it hasn't and it has its peak time and thaangs.) So if you haven't played 2010 aliens vs. predator before I recommend you pick it up if its cheap enough and if you want a laugh head over to the forums and watch people claim there clan is the best in a dead game. Pro tip bois: this isn't an Esports game.",

The story is based around 3 campaigns(that may or may not be interlocking, some parts seem that way while others don’t), one for each race and each with their own separate playstyles. The human campaign started out really creepy, like something taken straight out of Alien, but then quickly became a really fun shooter but whoever decided to add a thump sound to the radar is dumb. The alien campaign was the least enjoyable of the 3, in theory it should have been really fun because it has you climbing up walls and running on the roof but it is really disorienting. The predator campaign was also enjoyable but the stealth elements were pretty much useless so good thing the melee combat was enjoyable. It flirts with outstaying its welcome and it is almost too tedious but it ends at a good point and it’s not too dragged out. Overall I feel like this was a fun game, nothing amazing or anything but enjoyable.",

The game is always in the first person view, making it highly realistic but a bit confusing when running on walls and it takes some getting used to.  The sounds are highly emersive and very realistic, adding to the atmosphere of the game.  The graphics are very good (as already mentioned the game is based on the unreal engine 3 , so there isn't really a way to could look bad anyway ), naturally I found one or two places where the textures glitch out but those are random spots on the terrain where the majority of players wouldn't probably visit.  The gameplay is solid, the Marines campaign gets a bit tiring since it's pretty much a lot of the same. The aliens campaign is the best however the shortest, (you can't have your cake and eat it too) the predators campaign however kind of doesn't fit in... What I mean by that is that the entire battle between the aliens and humans doesn't really leave much space for the the predators story to develop, but then again I'm just nit-picking at a really solid title.",

Gameplay wise there's a ton of brutal executions via stealth attacks you can unleash on your foes, from riping out someone's throat as a Alien (or doing something ugodly worse with your tail) to of course ripping out people's spinal cord and collecting skulls as a predator. Even better, many of these executions can be preformed in multiplayer all be it less 'flashy'. Only issues I have with the game are control related, namely with the alien who takes a bit of getting use too.. And the campaigns are a bit short, though I reckon I can't expect 3, 12 hour long campaigns in one game. It's an outstanding game that I highly recommend, and much better than (in my opinion) than newer aliens/predator based games.",

Xenomorphs can traverse on walls and sneak up on enemies only to tear their head off. Predators can go invisible for a short time and have thermal optics to better see enemies, slashing them to bits. And Marines, well.. they have guns. Being able to play as all 3 species puts a whole twist on the franchise, and allows people to finally realize what it feels like to be a bloodthirsty Predator. While this game is old, it is still a classic. My one and only complaint is that the campaign is rather short for all the species. You basically play for awhile completeling various objectives, fight a boss, then switch species. It can be over quick, but still very enjoyable. If you enjoy the movies, you'll love the game.",

I managed to play this game with everything set to max (without Anti-Aliasing, AA.) without skipping a beat with my ageing ATI HD5850.  There are 3 different campaigns to play, you can play as an Alien or a Xenomorph, Predator or as a human (Marine). You’ll love to play all 3 campaigns because the developer has really put effort into the sounds to make you really experience the “Alien vs Predator”-world. You remember the radar sound from the Aliens movie? Well the Marines are carrying them. Remember the roar the predator does? And the shriek of an Alien? These might be subtle things, but to a fan this means a lot!  This game offers also multiplayer with various modes.  Peace.",

The Predator campaign is really whats fun about the game. the effects were impressive at moments in the game, and were very poor also. Now the Alien campaign isnt too bad either but I found it being a headache most of the time and annoying at parts. The human campaign lacked really in most areas of gameplay and effects. Like I said the Predator campaign is actually fun for the most part but yet it has lacking and unimpressive portions as well. I'm not going to reveal to much about the game for spoiler alert reasons but im sure by now mosy have seen at the very least gameplay of it all so it doesent matter i supose but the point im making is if your thinking about obtaining the game then know that the campaign is not excessively long at all and the multiplayer was never really good and no one plays it anyways anymore. If your a fan then you will enjoy moments of it and cherish it in your own way but yes this game lacks in many areas and could have been done much better if you ask me. however for the price you hopefully wont regret it.   6.5/10",

It allows you to run on walls, perform really 18+ finishers, harvesting people(works only on civilians) with facehuggers, and sprinting so fast, that you will constantly crush on walls. The Alien's abilities make the gameplay really short -took me 1 hour to finish it-, you will create a bond with it and in the end, you will feel satisfied, or sad. The Alien's name is 6 by the way.

After that you go have dinner and when you come back you try out the marines campaign and after 5 minutes you realise your screwed because all you have is a pistol, a flashlight and a flare against things that can go almost invisible in the dark and have extendo tails that we all wish we could stick in their heads. After you get freaked out from being a weak little marine you keep going and open a door but theres a xenomorph that then decides to kill you beside your best efforts with your pistol that you wish is as strong as the one from Halo.

The alien campaign is also really fun, you get to crawl around air vents and then hunt down one-by-one and kill enemies. Even the human campaign is fun; you get to kill aliens and predators. There’s boss fights for each campaign. The controls and graphics still hold up pretty well. The only issue that I have with this game is that the campaign all together is short; it only took me 6 hours total to complete all 3 campaigns. It has good replay value to it. I played this game on the PS3 and I enjoyed it enough to play it again on the PC with extra pretty graphics. I would definitely pick this game up on a sale if you can.",

The combat system for all three factions is solid enough. The story is questionable but enjoyable. The sound of killing your enemy feels like in the movies.. only better!   Now... if i sum up al these good things about the game, why does it feel so dull?!  Predator: You play as a unkouwn predator who is send off to a planet wich is 'ruled' by the marines, you continue trough some levels of killing marines and aliens until you end up in the tempel where you fight a boss-alien. There isn't a real story tied to this guy.. But it's the most fun to kill enemies.  Alien: You play as a predator (number 6), you and your mates escape from the laboratory from Wayne industries. The whole point of this species is to root out all the other spieces on the planet and ultimatly number 6 to become the Queen of all xeno's. You can see your own tail wich is cool, you can walk on walls and ceiling, pretty fun! combat is sometimes a bit strange. You can hunt down harmless civilians and kill them in an awesome way!  The shadows are your friend! The marines don't stand a chance if you play it smart!  Marines: You are a marine wich you team has left you to complete their objective and you are guided by a fellow marine. I didn't put much hours in this one because it's pretty boring at times.. it's the greatest challenge in the game and this playtrough has some horror elements. You just use your rifle and pistol to kill all the Xeno's and predators..   that's a bit of a overview over the factions you can play. Each faction has 5 levels each, wich is pretty low.. The levels feel all the same because you pass with each species trough the same levels but in a different order. The levels become boring if you play for an hour trough, because yeah, everything you do is the same!   if you are looking for a game to stun you by it's awesome gameplay, then i can say that the first 2 levels give you such a feeling but after it's nothing more then just a straight line with some bumps here and there.  Game in overall feels dull and boring at sometimes and probably not worth the full 14.99€ instead go for 10€   I'll just recommond it because it isn't that bad!  if i could say wich food this is, then it's definlty cheese!   i rate this game a 6.5/10  for being overall pretty boring and dull, but it has good visuals and average sound + solid gameplay!",

However, are we forgetting this is the year 2010? It's suppose to look superior in all aspects compared to the classics, and even then the animations for the humans here are nothing worth commenting upon.

But the smartgun is fun just to tear through aliens making you feel like a bada**. The Predator Campaign now is more focused on stealth but it doesn't have to be that way. You can tear through marines and aliens easily. There is four special weapons (hint: the last one is really strong and can help you in a tough situtation). Now the Aliens Campaign is my favorite campaign of all three. You get to feel like a true killing machine, tearing through marines.

The game features a unique three-way online multiplayer experience, allowing gamers to battle for survival and the right to be crowned the deadliest species in the galaxy. Each race also has its own distinct action-packed single-player campaign mode, with a storyline that cleverly interweaves with the other two species’ paths. Set on planet BG-386; a human colonist mining group discovers an ancient pyramid containing a dark and horrible secret. Across the galaxy, a race of warriors is alerted to the discovery of their pyramid and a hunting party is dispatched to ensure that it remains sealed at all costs. Deep inside the ruined pyramid meanwhile, nature's deadliest species awakes from centuries of hibernation intent on finding new prey. The Colonial Marine's story is an incredible fight against all odds from horrors lurking in the dark. Surrounded on all sides yet armed to the teeth, the Colonial Marine represents humanity's last stand with the firepower to fight back. As the Alien, players discover what it's like to be the scariest, most murderous creature in the universe, with the ability to traverse any surface at lightning speed in order to get close enough to unleash its deadly claws, tail and teeth. A master of the hunt, the Predator grants the player an arsenal of exotic weaponry with which to stalk from the shadows. Earn the greatest honor by ambushing prey up-close, before butchering them for a gory trophy kill.",

I am traditionally not an FPS player, but I liked the idea of seeing the story from multiple perspectives and being able to play as marines, aliens and predators.   All of the different play styles were enjoyable, especially predators with their nifty abilities and they all played differently. One part of playing as an aliend that I didn't like was climbing on stuff upside down. At times, it actually got a little nauseating, but again, I'm not used to the first person perspective and for those who are, they may not find it as off putting.  I also dabbled in a few multiplayer matches and found them to be enjoyable. I would argue that multiplayer does not have a great balance between classes, but in the context of the fiction, I'm not sure it's supposed to. Predators seem to have the best ability to take down enemies and they are fun to play as, but I actually enjoyed feeling like the underdog in certain situations, it gave the match a sense of excitement and accomplishment when vanquishing a superior enemy.   This game will not win any awards for amazing innovation or technical prowess, but does that really matter? Not to me. I enjoyed the game for what it is; a fun trip into an enjoyable fiction.   ",

While it was mediocre upon its release, it is leagues better than the Colonial Marines ♥♥♥♥-heap Gearbox tried to sell us. Or, use it as a benchmark for your rig.

I am a big fan of the avp franchise, I love the alien trilogy (I refuse to acknoledge Alien ResurrectioN), I love all the predator movies (Predators was awesome) but I HATE the AVP movies that people will know why we avp fans hate the movies. Thankfully AVP does have a strong line of games in it's history and when I saw that this game was being made back in 09, I was a kid who was excited to crap myself when I see the alien and predator duke it out again. Ironically this was actually the first game that I ever preorderd and I wasn't actually disappointed. Was the game better than the predecessors? No, the game sadly has some flawes like a campaign that's alittle too safe in terms of story, the multiplayer could have done some more work, the multiplayer respawn was pretty bad and there wasn't any new stuff to add to the alien and predator in terms of species and weaponry. but is the game bad like most reviews back then? Hell no, the marine campaign is great as it was scary and intense, the predator had an interesting take similar to the avp movie but did a better job had a great campaign to actually practice how to play the predator, the alien campaign, again had the weakest campaign, had the most satisfying campaign for stalking and executions. Multiplayer was a complete blast. Yea I know there's no evolution like in AVP 2, which I never did tried cause I was too young to know that game, but there are alot of modes that make the game really fun. My favorite are the predator hunt, Infestation and domination. If this game goes on sale, I'd suggest you check it out. It's a great game with some flaw but it will keep you satisfied",

            "review_text": "For all two of you reading the reviews for this older game, I promise AVP is worth the $3.50 I paid for it. Players control the marines, Predators, or aliens in separate but interwoven campaigns. Each race behaves differently and requires a unique strategy to master. The marines follow a pretty standard (but enjoyable) first-person shooter model. The Predators use a combination of hand-to-hand and stealth, but also employ a number of high-tech gadgets, like laser cannons, proximity mines, and cloaking fields. The aliens are the most mobile of the three and use speed, stealth, and their ability to climb on any surface to get the drop on their foes. All three races battle each other in a storyline that basically doesn't exist but doesn't need to. Aliens bite through human skulls and Predators get mowed down by the pulse rifle, and it's awesome for any fans of the franchise. The campaigns also offer a nice variety in the enemy department. Unfortunately, a few blemishes mar this otherwise great game. Firstly, the multiplayer is dead. That's a shame, because the game was designed with a great balance between the three races that would have made for fast and furious team death matches. Secondly, while it's great to play as the aliens, I found a lot of faults with their campaign. I don't personally get motion sickness from games, but anyone who does will want to avoid playing as the Xenomorphs. Their ability to speed across any surface can be dizzying at times. I found myself having trouble adjusting to fully three-dimensional thinking, and some players might dislike the fact that the ceiling and walls can also be the floor. The aliens' full-spectrum vision made the world look a little cartoonish, and their campaign was simply too limited. It's much shorter than the other two, probably intentionally. The aliens can only slash with their claws and tails, so combat becomes repetitive. Allowing the player to control a spitting Xenomorph or a Queen for a few levels might have added some variety. Too bad the developers neglected to do that. Lastly, the Predator acquires a spear later in his campaign that's REALLY over-powered. I had to actually force myself to use other weapons to make the fights more fair. Overall, though, the game is fantastic for any AVP fans. All the sounds from the movies are in full use here, and it's great to play with human and Predator technology. It's definitely worth the bargain price. 8/10.",

Playing alien is the most pleasurable, playing humans is the most challenging, and playing predator is a little inbetween, and I say that mainly because they are much easier to shoot at than the aliens. Play as all of them, great fun.",

Now onto Alien's side. Its really fun to play as the Alien but its alot harder then the Predator it really relies on stelth but as said before the humans can find you like they are terminator X10. It can make you sick flipping up and down so much and it is hard to be stelthy being upside down on the roof of everything. I also came across alot of glitches in the Alien's gameplay and its very disapointing when there isnt any in the other parts of the game. Not once do you fight a Predator which i found very disapointing.  The Human side of it all. I havent play all the way through it but what i did play was really fun. Even with a gun in my hand i was still scared when a Alien came up to me to try and eat my face. it is kinda hard to stay in a single room and kill an intire wave of Aliens without killing yourself in the process. So far the human side is good but no way near as fun as the others  I give this game 8/10 its a good game but had alot of glitches and bad AI when it comes to the stelth side of it all",

This is especially apparent in the Predator campaign with the energy recharge mechanics being done away with entirely, the arsenal diminished and a trophy mechanic that is just useless.

Then, many years later, the news came that Rebellion again was working on an Aliens vs Predator game that felt like a reboot instead of a sequel.  Make no mistake: Aliens vs Predator is entertaining. It looks good, it plays well and it sounds good. Especially the sound is the key factor as those who saw the films of both franchises (who didn't?) want to hear the aliens screaming or the predators using their gadgets. Or the human beings scream as they fall victim to these monstrous creatures, right?  Then what went wrong? Well, Rebellion made an extremely short game. You have 3 campaigns but they all are very short and some of the areas appear in all 3 storylines. It is not necessarily a problem as these affect one another, it's just annoying that after 9 hours you have finished all 3 campaigns.  Unfortunately, by the time I purchased Rebellion's latest aliens game multiplayer had already gone dead. I was unable to find any games, thus, I simply cannot evaluate this part of the game. This also means that in case you wish to purchase the game it is completely pointless to buy its DLCs that are only multiplayer add-ons.  It's a shame Rebellion gave us a very short aliens game with multiplayer that went dead a couple of years after its release. I do not recommend it, in fact, I do not know which aliens game to recommend as the latest, Colonial Marines, was atrocious, but that's another story.

But if your a predators fan then buy it. But i warn you this game can give you serious medical and mental problems cause it can give really bad stress.

            "review_text": "The good: + Great graphics if your computer can handle it. + A lot of mechanics (not good, but a lot). + Great sense of control.  The bad: - Rock, paper, scissors melee combat. (Humans shouldn't be able to beat an alien by punching their face, wtf!) - Poor design, both for controls schemes and mechanics. Where the earlier AvP game was epic this one lacks depth and feels like 1 step back. - Multiplayer sucks, period. It's also dead anyway. - No versatility and no advantages related to each race. - Close-to-zero graphics support, e.g. no FOV settings. - Poor story, lackluster overall. - No balance or appeal.  Overall rating for me, 3/10.  I'd like to elaborate on mechanics. In the earlier versions of the game we were set with 3 different races: Humans, aliens and predators, and each of them had several advantages and disadvantages. On top of that, each class had variations, e.g. predators could be standard ones (beefy guys with blades, a combi-stick, a plasma cannon and a disk), also a heavy variation (plasma pistol, combi-stick, slower movement, more health, spear rifle...) and so on, here we are set with the same versions for everyone, where some stuff outshines the rest.  On top of that, mechanics have changed since the last installment. - Humans could gain the upper hand using the heat radar, clump up in a choke point and mow enemies down with a shotgun, a minigun, whatever.  - Aliens could sprint across walls, stun and feast on unsuspecting enemies, leaping across the map and capitalizing on mobility and dodging attacks. - Predators had average speed and could jump a little higher than humans, but they had their cloak to stalk enemies and kill them from stealth. They had worse weapons than humans' and worse mobility than aliens', but they made up with free healing and energy replenishment on demand, and were capable fighters both in melee and at range.  In this game: - Humans can beat both predators and aliens (who have metal-shredding claws, acid, melee weapons...) using their bare fists. On top of that they have the range advantage since most of their weapons hit instantly and deal a lot of damage, and they still keep their heartbeat sensors. This makes them one of the preferred classes by most players. - Aliens are the rant class. All they have that others don't is wall-crawling, and they are easily beaten in melee by anyone in the game, which makes them useless. - Predators have autoaim plasma cannons, cloak, stealthy weapons and much better mobility (probably the best in the game, even better than aliens). They no longer have on-demand healing and their energy has been severely nerfed (very low reserves and needs power sources to recharge) and that's a pity. Also their weapon arsenal has been reduced greatly and some weapons are useless (like the combi-stick, which is now a throwing spear) since they are heavily affected by lag, which happens in any online match.  In short, the mechanics have been turned into garbage, thrown into the trash can, recycled and taken a ♥♥♥♥ on afterwards, because there's barely any fun outside the campaign.  Final verdict, buy it at a super discount (like 3-5€) if you want to play the campaign, which isn't the worst experience ever but it's more about hunting for collectibles than paying attention at the lackluster story.",

I get you want us to use the flashlight but my god would it kill you to add a couple bright lights or something?

Even though they play through the same map they all take different pathways.   Expert mode is a challenge and I like challenging - dynamically fun - games. AVP is definitely a changing beast because you can find new ways to exploit your PVE content.  I'd rate this 4/10  Only worth $7.50-$10 if you can catch it on sale.
