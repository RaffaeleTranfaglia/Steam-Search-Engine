Its simple graphics and controls hide an incredibly challenging and addictive game that only gets better the longer you play it.  The beat of the music drives the entire experience, sucking you into the epileptic colors and lights of the moving levels. Super Hexagon never goes easy on you or even pretends to want to give you a hand. Its meant for those that love a challenge, that get goosebumps over seeing they beat their hi-scores, and that will spend hours practicing a single level.  If that sounds like you Super Hexagon will not disappoint. Though it began as a mobile game, the move to PC with improved controls only enhances the experience, and I can't imagine playing it any other way. If you are looking for a game that put your reflexes to the test, you've found it.   You can read more of my writing on  Kritiqal  [kritiqal.com] . ",

When I started game for the first time when for the first times I lost on the second or sixth second when I wanted to break the computer about a wall, I didn't guess at all that it so will tighten me. The essence of game is simple to a disgrace: it is necessary to hold on as it is possible more long, operating a triangle and wagging between figures. In game there are six levels of the complexity three of which need to be unblocked the infernal torments. The task becomes complicated that the field on which is your triangle turns, spins, changes corners, figures are transformed, from octagons smoothly turn into squares, and speed doesn't think at all to decline. When you look how other people pass the last levels - the head starts being turned. Music in game is simply divine. Because of it I didn't throw game right at the beginning. Game pulses and moves under music, synchronization between the events on the screen and a sound in earphones absolute, as gives special charm to game. To fly between 'хексагонами' under such special electronics takes and inspires. Chipzel' huge respect for an excellent soundtrack. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).",

But at the same time the sense of getting so far or beating your previous best give you a great sense of achievement.

The player (you) are a tiny triangle that's free-roaming rather than stiff and static in motion, which adds a bit of a challenge to the game. In this game, upon first start, are three basic modes, nicknamed  Hexagon  (the easiest, apparently),  Hexagoner  (medium difficulty), and  Hexagonest  (the first hardest). Your time on these stages is your overall score, and after lasting one minute in the first three, you unlock a much more harder mode of the same stage ( Hexagon/er/est Hyper ).

Be prepared to restart the game after a few secs, 10-20 times in a minute. Rinse and repeat, again, again, again, until you're done - or good enough.  This game consists of 'only' 6 stages, I rather call them 'circles of Hell'. That ♥♥♥♥ It's hard. Very hard (already told it's HARD with capital letters?).   Theorically, this game could be completed in less than 10 minutes, if you are an autist, or have a great mind for detecting patterns, since each stage lasts 60 seconds (could be more, but 60 secs are the minimum needed to clear the stage, get the achievement and proceed to the next torture).  I've completed this game in 9-10 hours. You get used if you play hours and hours in one sitting. Your mind learns how to read and, most importantly, antecipate the patterns. It's all about patterns, folks. My results were way better when I turned the music off and started to listen Two Steps from Hell (name quite apropriate, but not intentional), by the way. The game's music might be a more adequate challenge for being quite disturbing (that's the idea, I guess), but it gaves me headaches.  That all said, this game is awesome for those looking for a mental challenge more than a game. Super Hexagon is hardly a game in the way the most are used to. It's more a competition between your brain, eyes and hands.   My final advice is to avoid to buy it in full price, Wait for a sale or bundle, since this game could - and will be - frustrating and gives you no reason to replay it when you finally finishes (its like breaking the chains).",

Each level you have to avoide obstacles for at least 60 seconds so then you unlock the new level. There are only a few levels but hey take a long time to complete. The first time you play a level your brain goes; 'WTF! WHAT THE HELL! AGHHHHHHHHH! ' but eventualy you learn routes to avoide them and eventualy you'll complete it if you keep on playing it (which it was hard for me not to stop playing it as it's very addictive). And the further levels you play the previous levels become very slow to you. They're the same speed but they feel soo slow and your like: How was this so fast before?  But if your the person who rages at games, then: don't buy it cos you'll thrash your pc. I've got a friend who gets angry easily and he played a simular game to this and he smashed his pc. So if you rage then don't buy it. If you don't rage at games: then do buy it There isn't much more to this game as this is it. But it's very fun, addictive and cheap so it's definitely worth getting it, especially if you have nothing else to do and your bored",

You might even say it is addicting.  To understand the game it would be easiest to just watch some gameplay because once you see it, you will understand it. I have only managed to beat level 1 in this game because I am not MLG enough to get any further, but I will say that I do enjoy this game for its simple and challenging gameplay. It was quite fun seeing how fast I improved over time as I would break my old scores. (Even though I suck). There are 6 levels total, and even though that may not seem like much, they are all very tough to beat and if you do manage to complete them it will take you many many hours of practice.  In conclusion, this game will provide a very challenging and fun experience for those looking for something that is simple, difficult, and unique. The difficulty may slam dunk you so hard that you may just quit playing one day because you can't get any further, but the game is pretty cheap and it is something you can come back and play any time.  Super Hexagon is a saucy diversion that will satisfy those looking to jam and slam with the best. Buy it and get wrecked.",

After you play for as long as I did the patterns start to merge together and you subconciously know what is going to happen, you predict the random generation.  As you feel your way through the first three levels you start to learn that the game has a few tricks that you won't expect your first hour or three, but as the advisor speaks its single words to you 'Line' 'Triangle' Square' 'Pentagon' 'Hexagon' you feel empowered after each of these dauntful yet encouraging quotes. And once you begin to get higher scores like mine on the 'Hard' difficulty of 5+ minutes, everytime you reach a new minute you here 'Awesome' like you have finally accomplished a goal and milestone. But as the adventure continues to the final levels, you start to feel a shadow looking down on you as you reach an impassable barrier on your quest to 60 seconds.  With every minute passing you feel more and more frustrated by the lack of progress until you finally feel your way through the patterns that you haven't yet seen, you being to make the progress you wanted and are on top of the world, then at 50+ seconds the game pulls a trick and you are back to zero. The cycle of time starts again and you are stuck there. And once you beat the game the milestones only continue to grow, forever and eventually into 5, 10, 15 minutes of Hexagon.  This is the Super Hexagon way, a challenge and a frustration, but also a accomplishing task.

This inconsistency is prohibitive.  Also, the game is intentionally visually confusing, but it succeeds too well. I frequently believe I should have lost, but did not, and vice versa.  I am frequently unable to tell at which exact pixel my unit is located, and unable to move it in a reliable manner. This is a recipe for terrible. As a player of bullet hell games, I'm no stranger to moving small objects through obstacles within a distance of one pixel... This game could have been designed better.  That aside, the starting levels are always possible to beat- there is no 'chance' or 'luck', you win or lose on your skills alone, and I blame myself for more failures than I blame the game's design.  However, I'm convinced that the later levels can and do generate sequences where you are physically unable to win given the established mechanics, and they introduce an element of chance in a game that is supposed to rely on skill, which I'm sure is one of the seven deadly sins. For example, the 'camera' might angle around so you cannot see where the next turn is, as it often does in all levels, but the later levels move faster while the unit you control is always restricted to the same speed. Where you are in relation to where the next exit is purely chance, and you can't always get there in time.  But hey, I think I got this for 0.30USD. I can't complain, and it's a fairly reliable way to test and hone reflexes.",

But while we thought the tribes were the enemy, there is, in fact, a much darker force at work here. In a dramatic turn of events, we learn that the tribes weren't malicious after all. The polygon people are in grave danger; the attacks on our hero were merely collateral damage in the much grander fight. In a heart-touching scene, we see a young quadrilateral display sympathy with a moving gesture of compassion towards our hero. These shapes are just as human as you or I. Our hero is faced with a choice: escape now, or attempt to save the polygon people? The former would be selfish, the latter would be impossible and surely suicide. But he is undaunted in his endeavor, and pushes forward against the forces of darkness. We see him progress through battlefields in a war between the very realities themselves. Red, Blue, Green, Purple, Black. The colors of armies all clash together in a fight for existence. He will end this. He has to end this. He trudges on, deeper and deeper into the angled abyss. Finally, our hero arrives at the gates to the domain of evil itself. Limbo. There's no turning back now. The battle seems endless. This realm's vertexes and angles are so ethereally plagued by darkness, it would drive a man mad within minutes. But our hero's will is as hard as iron. The enemy employs psychological warfare tactics, further progressing our hero's decent into insanity. A ubiquitous ocean of whispers never seems to cease ringing in his ears. 'Fifty-eight secondssss,' they taunt. Our hero arrives at the core. This is it. Failure now would mean the end of existence. Now, he must face the very essence of evil. The entity of fear, destruction, and all things unholy. Does he make it? Was he able to defeat the Evil, and push back their armies into oblivion? I don't know. We may never know the true fate of the polygon people of the sixth dimension. We may only hope that our hero was successful, and, if he wasn't, hope that the Evil never set foot into our own world. But I can tell you this: There is not black or white. There is not light or dark. Not reality or fantasy, nor life or death. There is only hexagon.",

Can make some people dizzy with all the twisting and turning and colors changing. It's a great short game and the ultimate goal is to last as long as you can. There is an option to enable 'Arcade mode' which after each turn allows you to type your name in and stuff. Great for tournaments and parties!  I really like the music, too. The style gives it an arcade feel, upbeat chiptune electronica music. The artist is Chipzel and the third stage music in the game, Hexagonest, is my favorite. That track is called Focus. Overall, it's a great simple game that puts your eyes to the test. Definitely worth it.",

The fundamentals to being good at this game is being able to learn the patterns and be able to recognize the patterns and be able to make your hold timings consistently long so that turning is like multiple choice between 1,2,3 sectors and direction rather than watching the arrow turn.

Super Hexagon is probably the most fun, addicting, yet rage enducing game I have played before. At the beginning, I didn't even know that the left arrow key makes you go left, and the same with the right. This game is very, very diffcult at the beginning. As you get to learn the patterns, you slowly pass the levels, until you hit the hyper mode levels. These levels are challenging, although not as hard as your first try. Overall, I would say that this is a great game to play, and I always go to this game if I am ever just bored out of my mind.  Now... To something that I would like to change. First off, every level is a pattern. Sure, there are a few of them. I would love it so much more if there was always a different pattern to the level. Although, that would make it much harder, I would be way more satisfied about when I beat the levels, because I know that I beat it, not even knowing what I was going into.  Overall, I rate this game a 9/10. An 11/10 on the rage scale. Maybe punching your desk so hard that your knuckles hurt for 2 weeks isn't a good idea. Whatever, I still LOVE this game!!",

Extremely well thought out, and I enjoyed it immensely. It really added to the whole experience. 10/10  The Gameplay- As I said before, you play as a triangle rotating around a hexagon dodging walls. Your goal is to survive 60 seconds without being hit, then the level is completed. There are 6 levels- Hexagon, Hexagoner, Hexagonest, Hyper Hexagon, Hyper Hexagoner, and Hyper Hexagonest. Their difficulty levels in the game are Hard, Harder, Hardest, Hardester, Hardestest, and Hardes♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, respectively. As the difficulties suggest, each level makes it harder to make it beyond 60 seconds by speeding up how quickly the walls come at you. Overall, it's very original and surprisingly fun. 9.5/10  Replay Value- This game is built so that every time you play the same level, it is different. In reality, the only things that are the same are the background colors, music, and difficulty/name. Never will you play the same level twice, which means that you can play for hundreds of hours experimenting with new stuff. And with 6 levels, it will keep you for a while. 10/10  Addiction and Difficulty- This game has a strange power I have never seen any other game come close to having- well, maybe except for Solitaire... anyways, this game is addicting as all heck. I tell you, I played this game every single day for 3 months. I kept coming back for more. Even long after I had beaten the game, I had kept coming back. This game is extremely difficult. Most people don't stay long after starting because they give up. However, it is genuine difficulty. It's not because of poor controls or level design, it's because they haven't practiced enough. Super Hexagon is a game of practice makes perfect. You cannot expect to be good at it right away. And with that, I commend it. For making people need to try over and over. 10/10  Graphics/Music- This game's 'graphics' Are pretty much just vectors set on a colorful spinning background. They're simple. They don't try to be amazing, since that's not what this game tries to do. They aren't the best, but what they lack, is makes up for in music. This game has an amazing soundtrack of a whole 3 songs. But these songs are amazing. In fact, 'Focus', the theme of Hyper Hexagonest and Hexagonest, is in my top 10 video game themes of all time. 10/10  Story- 10/10 Gameplay- 9.5/10 Addiction and Difficulty- 10/10 Replay Value- 10/10 Graphics/Music- 10/10 Total- 99/100- Go buy it NOW",

This game will throw you obstacles that you must quickly guide your arrow through without hitting the walls. Over time, you will able to identify the identical obstacles each of 6 levels throw at you which will help you survive if you make the correct reactions. There are 6 levels in this game. Naturally, each level has higher difficulty until the last level that is the hardest. The problem I find is that this game is really oriented toward audience with good twitches/reactions. Those that doesn't react quick with their fingers on keyboard or mouse will likely find this game rather frustrating instead of fun challenging. I find myself not reacting fast enough in many cases. There were times I did find it frustrating and I was very happy I finally beat this game in the end.   My personal rating for this game: 7/10  Side note: For some reason, the third level is much difficulty. I checked forum and I noticed the regular compliants about it. I checked achievements and I definitely noticed the huge steep after 2nd level achievement and only 1% drop for 4th level achievement which implies that 3rd level was too hard. I believe 3rd level wasn't properly made. One person brought up the fact that the seconds it takes to rotate arrow in the game is not consistent in 3rd level compare to other levels. With the pace of that level in mind, that might be why.",

I have personally found there to be times that there is a very thick line (more than visible on screen) on all five or six sections of the gameboard. Later i was told that you can hit thick lines at some points but not others.  There is inconsistant data given to the player; you use a rectangular windows to view a non rectangular game. This means that you will be able to see farther in some directions than others. transitions from line to triangle and triangle to square mean that the game board changes and changes your position relative to where you were. This can make it ridiculously cumbersome if you do not know exactly when the whole board will change.   Did i mention the controls? they are awful. Learning to stop at any given point is difficult, as a tap of the control button will send you farther than you want to go.  I would not reccomend this game to anyone until the developers do something about the field of view and controls, or at least give some form of rule set that explains when it is ok to hit a line and when it means game over.  terrible game.",

This game seems to shift between forcing you to focus on what's coming toward you, and muscle memory depending on what patterns are coming your way. Shifting between these mindsets constantly seriously makes me feel like my brains going to implode.  I enjoy this game, but I also hate it. It's fun to kill some time to at first, but eventually it grates your nerves.  Even though this game is probably going to surface some anger issues I didn't know I had, it's still good enough to be worth full price. It's very satisfying to be able to reach your next goal, even if you're not very good. Dying sucks in this game, but once you start bettering yourself and reaching more and more outstanding milestones, you'll feel like you've accomplished something worthwhile, even though you really haven't (I mean, it's just a high score in a game).  The soundtrack is actually extremly good. It fits the game's flashy colors and quick gameplay and it makes it sound like your in a retro rave. There are enough songs to keep the sound from getting too repetitive, but it does have the tendency to distract you, and distraction is something you can't have when playing this game. Hell, I don't think I even blink.  The character is cute too. I don't know what it is about being a Hexagon and taking control of a small arrow, but for some reason, it just adds a much needed 'd'aww factor'.",

You have to keep rhythm really well. The barriers fly around rapidly, changing types very often and requiring different modes of attack. But you have no time to think, and you can't pause the game, so be on the ready!  It took me a while but I beat the first mode, Hexagon. You need to pass 60 seconds in a mode to beat it.

It's like playing Slow Ride in Guitar Hero 3 with a random chance of having to suddenly play random riffs from The Devil Went Down to Georgia.  The second worst thing about this game is the difficulty spikes. You'll likely find yourself beating some levels in seconds but getting stuck on other levels for a few dozen minutes or more. A few dozen minutes might not sound bad but it takes a lot of deaths for you to be stuck on a 45 second level for a few dozen minutes.

However, the gameplay is too minimalistic. You retry the same level over and over, memorizing patterns, and almost nothing changes each time. You know what DOES change every time you die though? Your position. Your position is practically the only thing that doesn't reset when you die. However, if it was moving when you died, it will stay in that position, and will be annoyingly offset. Rarely, it may even make the game unplayable, causing you to become stuck on an angle that make some level configurations literally impossible. And by rarely, I mean in terms of death, not time, so considering the amount of times you will die, it is actually quite common. I probably experienced an instance of that within my first few minutes of playing. Seriously, there are plenty of other games that have insane levels of difficulty, with more satisfaction as well.",

Super Hexagon is a very basic 'Don't Collide!' game, similar to early racing games where all you do mechanically is to steer left and right. You do that with under the most minimal of error margins.  Prepare to die not only very often but in repeated succession that makes 'Dark Souls' feel like 'Barbie's Adventure in Teletubbieland'.  On the flipside, you'll be thrown right back into the fray in about a second.   Visuals are boldly simplistic but fitting and form a chic symbiosis with the soundtrack. Menus, controls etc are well done as is the level design.  CPU load is surprisingly heavy.  If you have lots of spare time on your hand, enjoy the classic vg inspired beats, have a masochistic streak and enjoy a healthy hand-eye coordination, check out the store video if you're into Ilynxesque reflex games.

Super Hexagon has a unique power: it can tell you what type of person you are. Do you easily accept defeat? Can you manage stress? How good is your eye-hand coordination? Are you impatient? Can you memorize patterns and feel the rhythm of Chipzel's amazing chiptunes? This game will put you to the test and with every success will come a great feel of accomplishment. Super Hexagon can provide a lot of fun and keep the adrenaline pumping for a very low price. Get it if you are into time attack games and climbing up the leaderboards.

If they don't interest you, well read it anyway, they might start once you get to the end.  Twitch timing, mobile port, satisfying, addicting, visually stunning, Zen.  okay, all of yall that are still here, this game is one of my favorite games that I didn't know was on my phone. You're a little triangle, and your trying to avoid the walls that are falling toward you from the edge of the screen. On the PC verson (I say PC like personal computer, not personal computer that has windows installed) you have three buttons, left right and select, I think you also get escape, but if you want out you can just stop playing and I promise you will be able to exit the game in less time. Anywho, the games namesake comes from the fact that you're moving around a hexagon, the likes of which loses and regains sides as you play, the fewest sides I've seen has been a square, but I feel like a triangle is also possible. This game feels great, I would recommend that you play it on a mobile device though. The match lengths have a tendency to range from less than ten seconds, out to a minute and thrity seconds, and to me that seems like a waste to launch a dedicated app for your computer, which might have trouble switching between apps, whereas it is available for android and iOS, for the same price. If you don't have one of those new 'Smart Phone' it is a pretty good time consumer, and for $2.99 it's a pretty fun game that requires very little dedication to pickup and put down for brief stints of entertainment.

It will not give up on its quest to impress even though no one is there to watch. It will prove it is the mightiest of all triangles to ever exist.

Not that it is in any kind comparable when looking at the gameplay or puzzling aspects, but the only way to get through the levels is to really shut down your brain and let your reflexes take over.  The first three or four rounds of playing I didn't get over ten seconds alive and couldn't grasp how to survive in this psychedelic world of flashing walls and rotation (oh, the rotation), but it pretty quickly becomes natural, partly due to my Tetris-drilled fingers, I guess and from that on it's plainly awesome.

You have no weapons - Fortunately, these irregular shaped beings are not too bright; with a well timed side-step, they'll rush themselves into the void and be obliterated.

You are not completely alone, however, as a narrator/companion helps you on your way. When you reach certain goals, she grants you various morale boosts. She will let you know when you've achieved your goal, but also gently lets you down when you fail. If you're up for a challenge - you can play for 120s through and unlock the secret dialogue with her.

Sure, you need reflexes of the flash, but its totally possible to be a hyper hexagonest master. besides, all you need to do is survive 60 seconds in each stage (Hexagon, hexagoner, hexagonest, Hyper hexagon, hyper hexagoner, and hyper hexagonest). so in theory, you could beat this game in less that 7 or 8 minutes, including menu time.  but that won't happen, in most cases.

Its really vicious and challenging, but it gives you the right amount of fun if you like hard games.  * The Music: Excelent, like old BGM but remastered. You want to survive more than 20 secs to actually hear some variations.  * The Price: I bought it while christmas sales for $0.69 USD.. almost nothing. Normal price its $3 USD, surely i would still buy it.  Conclusion: If you like HARD and CHALLENGING games, this is one for sure. So many hours just to beat a single level makes worth buying. Yet this is not a game for everyone, like i said before, if you like some fast, storybased and smooth games you should look something else. But for me... LOVE IT!",

Super Hexagon is a title that will help your skills to be aware of your surrondings! This game has a simple concept, but it's all about seeing how long you can endure the game's obstacles. All you do in the game is move left and right while avoiding walls that'll close on your little triangle (arrow). This game is pretty darn great, and if you ever see this game on sale or a humble bundle, GET IT! It's not the type of game you would play for hours at end, but a simple time waster, and when you're downloading a game on Steam or waiting for a video to buffer this is the game you should play.   Personal Experience:  There's not much to say really... I play this game as a time waster. My best time is about a minute so far, and I'm aiming to get to about 2 minutes. If you have a smartphone just download it there if you don't want to play it on Steam, but from personal experience (hah!) a keyboard is more responsive than a touch screen.  ~  twitch.tv/samsterboy  ~",

The player rotates a little outward facing triangular turtle (to borrow the Logo term) to avoid getting trapped by barriers.  The game features 6 difficulty levels total with 3 base levels and 'hyper' versions of each. A level is considered cleared if the player survives in it for at least 60 seconds.  Super Hexagon encourages - without frustration - better and better performances. Initially, surviving for over 15 seconds will seem like a great accomplishment while the 60 second goal is thought to be impossibly out of reach. The barrier patterns are randomly strung together with each playthrough. This allows for techniques to be developed without the need for rote learning. Along the way to 60 seconds the player will repeatedly attempt to improve upon the current best score. Doing so will be met with visual and audio rewards.  The game's minimalistic design is rounded out with brilliant subtleties. Only the front tip of the turtle must be kept out of harm's way, allowing the sides to make contact. The turtle has a terrific little wobble as it is moved left and right. The color changes and playing field rotation change between difficulty levels and also at different time marks within each level. On the most difficult level, shadows are used to pull off a pseudo 3D effect.  For controls, use WASD + spacebar or arrow keys + Enter. Use long continuous movements by pressing, holding, and releasing instead of repeated smaller movements.  Super Hexagon supports Steam cloud syncing and online leaderboards which can be filtered to only display the results of Steam friends.",

At point you get to level 4, Hyper Hexagon (which unlike level 3, Hexagonest, is not based on gimmicks and sudden camera rotation, it just throws stuff at you, very fast), it kinda like changes your perception of time. Suddenly you understand how much time there is in a second, how much can happen in a second, and still your brain somehow manages to react.  I, however, find it possible that it is physically impossible for me and many other people to complete this game. Time will tell.  The way the game loops the soundtrack is nice, it does not always start from the same part when you start a new game, which is nice since when you can't have your ♥♥♥♥ together and your flow going, you will be starting new games  a lot .  tl;dr: benchmark your brain!",

People aren't lying when they say this game is a spiritual experience, it's immersive on a level unlike anything I've ever played. When you play you don't want to blink or breathe, nothing in your peripheral vision registers. You exist as the arrow and your soul task is to stay alive. When I die I am seldom angry or frustrated, instead I just crave to be back inside the epileptic maze with that epic soundtrack pulsing in my ears. When I first finished this game I just had to sit down and process everything while my heart rate dropped back to normal, it was like finishing a long book series, I just didn't know what to do with myself anymore.  This will forever be my favourite game, 10/10",
