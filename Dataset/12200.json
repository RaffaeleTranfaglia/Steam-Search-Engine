It's good on any platform (speaking from experience e.g. Wii, PS2, PC, etc), but a warning, surround sound seems to be a bit messed up on this, so make sure you set your audio to 2.0.  Other than that, it's not a half bad port. The framerate is capped to 30, but understandbly so for a console port. It can be uncapped with mods. The pc controls still work fluently once you know them well, and can easily be rebound for preference. Though, I do recommend using a controller for a better experience.  So much love, care, and effort went into this game. It's so great.",

His mother and step father goes on a honeymoon leaving Jimmy to attend the Bullworth acedamy, meeting a kid named Gary who wants the school all to himself and of course hes gonna use you for his plan. Overall this game is great The combat feels smooth and the gun combat does feel smooth. The only real problems i found were sometimes the controls felt a bit stiff and the sound issues do ruin the game a bit. The game also has bonus collectibels, side quest, classes to go to, drivable bikes and skateboards and many more things in the world of Bully. Overall this game is fantastic just a few minor glitches but definatly you need this game in youre collection i give Bully 8.5/10  For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page  here  - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!",

            "review_text": "It's rare that a developer goes from making an adult game about crime with very adult themes, to making a game about a high school kid who moves to a school for child delinquents and socially challenged kids, but in a lot of ways Bully is like a GTA. For example, Bully is a open world with stuff to collect, bike races to do, arcade games to play and much more to just find and explorer. The mission structure is very similar to GTA, you do a bunch of work for one of the factions, like the Jocks or the Nerds, and the more you do with them, the more reputation you gain, which in turn effects how other people treat you around campus.  The combat is also very similar to GTA, but instead of machine guns and rocket lunches, you are playing with slingshots and stink bombs.  There are also lots of things different about Bully that really makes it feel like you are back in high school. It feels very structured, but that's not a bad thing at all. You have classes two times a day everyday until you pass the highest level of that class. All of the classes have their own perks, for instance, completing one class will show you where all of the collectibles are on the map.  Unlike the protagonists in GTA, Jimmy is 15 and needs his sleep, so if you are out past 2AM, you just pass out on the spot which can make some nigh missions feel a little too time restrictive but adds to the challenge.  I did't have any technical issues with Bully like a lot of people complain about on this port. Overall the game is well made but parts of it seem kind of repetitive, but I still think this is a fantastic game.",

A school full of bullies, nerds and annoying teachers. You go around helping people, going to classes, pulling pranks, bullying people, going to the carnaval and alot more!  Bully: Scholarship Edition uses a newer game engine than the original from 2006, it does look like a 2008 game but still has a really good school atmosphere. There are some downsides though, the pc controls are verry clunky and can make it annoying to play at times. The game crashes alot and this can make it really frustrating when you haven't saved after doing a few missions. Altough there are fixes on the internet, they still don't prevent the game from crashing at all.   Over all i would highly recommend Bully: Scholarship Edition, if you're a fan of openworld games with wide variety of content. Bully is an amazing interesting, refreshing and creative experience!",

You have to attend classes in order to unlock certain abilities, upgrades and outfits. You also play pranks on your schoolmates in order to gain reputation from the various fractions, do side events to earn some additional stuff and cash or find collectibles scattered all over the city.  The playtime should be something between 15 and 20 hours, depending on how much of the optional stuff you do and how often you fail.  Note that this is a console port with quite a few flaws. The keys are not re-bindable and the only options available are: Resolution, AA, VSync and Shadow quality. The game plays like crap with keyboard &amp; mouse, so I highly recommend to play it with a XBox controller.",

            "review_text": "Personal Rating: 7/10  Ah Bully. This games getting a sequel in 2016 so hopefully people can get hyped for that after they've stopped ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves about Fallout 4. However let's take a look at the first game.  Bully is an open world game set in a school. You play as Jimmy Hopkins who is arguabley the biggest ♥♥♥♥ on earth at the beginning of the game. Much like Rockstar's other games, you do quests located around the map to advance the story. Very GTA IV like but without any of those silly cars or mass genocides, carried out by helicopters and bowling.  Gameplay wise, it's honestly nothing special to be honest. I can't feel connected to Hopkins because he's a ♥♥♥♥, and I can't feel any sympathy for him or any bullies for that matter. I mean, I'm a nerd, in this game you're basically asking me to steal my own lunch money. But the jokes on him, I make my own lunch and bring it with me *pushes glasses up nose*. But nah, it's not fresh. There's nothing convincing me to do any of these actions apart from to advance the story.   One new thing they added into this game is classes. No, not Call of Duty classes. As in, actual learning classes like Art, English and Science. You might be thinking 'Well what's the point in going to classes? I live the thug life'. Well, these classes can eventually give you upgrades and weapons such as stinkbombs, clothing and even a bike (which I never got, apparently my lack of skills in production and art carried over into this game). Each class revolves around a minigame, like in English for example, you have to make as many possible words out of a jumble of letters, or in Art where you have to avoid pencils and stuff to draw a picture? I don't know what they were thinking but it works I suppose.  Obviously a big part of the game is combat. But it lacks a certain something. Beat 'em ups and Fighting games have never appealed to me, and Bully is basically a beat 'em up with a couple of minigames slapped on the top, with an unrelatable character and numerous little cracks in this game.  However, it's still great. As much as I've complained about this game, it really is a very good game. Graphically wise it might not stand up to today's standards, however they were good for it's time. Some of the characters like the Principal and the Homeless Bloke are well made and I enjoyed the parts of the game they were in. Now obviously I haven't played all of this game, I finished it on my Xbox 360 though so that can sort of give you an idea.  The one big problem with the Steam version is that if you try and change the options, such as the size of the screen, the game will crash. Well, it did in my case, so I'm playing the game in a 4:3 window. The game's options are full of bugs that may crash the game, so be careful.",

Characters and story are memorable and clearly intended as exaggeration of high-school stereotypes, although many come as 1-shots for some reason. One can't help but praise out-of-nowhere dramatic final confrontation which ends up being EXTREMELY satisfying and just, though.

The game has a few other problems and areas that I wish were expanded and improved but it's stil worth the &lt;10.00 price of admission   Overall: 8.5/10  Pros: + Hollywood levels of voice acting, writing and storytelling  + All the cast of charachters are awesome. Jimmy is a bamf and the main antagonist is an evil genius that's easy to hate  + Game is full of charm; from the quintessential Rockstar sense of humour pervading the entire game, to the locations, to the great soundtrack + Unique setting that is well thought out  + Fun combat system  + Game is a decent length  Cons: - Bland missions - Game has almost no challenge  - Money is useless in the game so there's no incentive to complete errands on top of missions - Combat is fun, but somewhat button-mashy  - You can't stay out past a certain time otherwise you'll get done for violating curfew which means exploration outside of school grounds is discouraged/ not enjoyable - Virtually nothing to do once you complete the storyline- unless you enjoy collecting gnomes?",

I don't think I've ever played a game that stands up so well after nearly a decade since initial release.  The story, the characters, the atmosphere, that perfect soundtrack, all are as great as the first time I experienced the game. Although I'm insanely hyped for Red Dead 2, a little part of me was sad that the announcement wasn't a sequel to this game.  Bully has pretty simple open world gameplay, but the world that makes me come back everytime. There's a sense of nostalgia that just follows you throughout the game, even if you've never played the game before, the school setting has a really charming old school feeling to it.  Can't say enough amazing things about this game. I was thinking about what my favourite game of all time was and I just couldn't pick one, but then I remembered that this game is the only one I still play after finishing it so many times already it doesn't lose any of the magic that made it great.  I'm also kind of worried about the sequel to this game, because I don't think a game with atmosphere and characters this perfect can be topped, or even matched. That's how great I think it is.

It never feels like a chore to play, with more varied missions that keep it interesting long after you'd usually get bored with a GTA campaign. When I saw it on the Summer Sale, I got without hesitation and started my journey through Bullworth Academy for my 4th time. The only complaint I have with the game is that the towns outside of the school never feel as fleshed out or interesting. But that and minor glitches aside, Bully is a fenominal game.

The stats in the game doesn't really leave out any details of what some people might wanna see and wants to tell their friends who also played this game or compare it with them. This game is very great and recommended to those who miss out their School days. When I was trying to buy this game, I was thinking really hard if it was going to be good or not. I didn't want to look at the reviews of what people put because there was probably going to be spoliers I don't want to see. So I took my chance and got the game definitley didn't regret on getting this game. One of the Best Games that takes to a different level in most of the games you'll probably played before 2008. The graphics and the audio is okay. There's certain parts of when it crashes. So, you'll have to save most of the time. This part is important though, If you wanted the multiplayer version, you'll have to get it for the console. The Computer/Steam Version doesn't have Multiplayer.

It is a very fun, long games with many different character outfits. You decide what clothes you like, you can create costumes, unlock costumes doing secret achievements.  This game can get repetative though, and i wouldn't suggest playing it daily, however once you play it you usually get stuck into it for a couple of hours.

There are collectibles scattered across the map, required to get for 100% completion, but really boring to catch. When you finish the game you can attend classes and pass them, you can finish missions you didn't before, do errands that you didn't, free roam, and explore some myths (minor thing). If you think it would be ok to give this amount (I got this on a sale of 75% at the moment) for up to 20 hours of gameplay, you're good to go. If you like games that are longer, up to 50-100 hours, this isn't for you. My final word is, buy it, but be prepared for a fast paced game. A great journey it was. 10/10.",

Don't assualt girls. Don't assualt adults. ...or at least don't get caught.  The game has a solid story, solid voice acting, and good controls. The only real downside is that it has a tendency to randomly crash. After modding it with 60 FPS hack, the crashes were less frequent. I don't believe Rockstar still updates or supports this game, so those of us with newer comps just have to deal with the crashing.  Don't let it stop you though, this game is still one of my favorites. It's also one of the few games I've beaten several times over.",

I have fond memories of spending hundreds of hours playing this game as a kid on my PS2 when it was released. Even though I beat the game, it's still always tons of fun running around being a dumbass and bullying students and adults, and doing other random ♥♥♥♥.  The controls aren't that bad, but not perfect. But its definitely manageable. The updated graphics are also REALLY nice, as well. It made me tear a bit seeing the game I spent so much time on as a kid look almost completely different. It's no GTA 5, or even GTA 4, but still.  The storyline is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I don't want to spoil any of it, but the game progression and how new things are unlocked all the time as you progress always make it a treat. The characters are also really loveable and somewhat relateable, if you remember High School being this ♥♥♥♥ed up. Eventually, you'll know all the names of every single student and will know them by heart, as every character in the game also has their own personality. You'll eventually grow attatched to one or two of the characters in the game, and definitely the main character, Jimmy Hopkins. They're also all hilarious, as are most of the missions.  The customization is really great, too. It might not be as detailed or anything as GTA 4 and 5, since it came out before those games, but it's still really great. You can change Jimmy Hopkins to fit what you like exactly, and I think every Jimmy Hopkins almost defines what they would want to look like in that world.  Now, the BEST part of this game would have to be the soundtrack. The soundtrack, composed by Shawn Lee, is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Every clique has their own fight theme that perfectly fits their styles and descriptions, while also sounding so awesome. My favourite is tied between the Prep and Greaser Vendetta Themes (Fight themes). It also seems every mission has it's own song to shift the mood perfectly. The game has won many awards for a Rockstar game that isn't filled with blood, killing, wreckless driving and violence, guns, sex and dirty jokes. And it definitely deserves every award, and more. 100/10. Definitely worth every single penny.",

I first played part of this game on my cousins' Nintendo Wii, which inspired me to buy this game.  The soundtrack is upbeat and great. Fits different situations nicely. I could personally listen to the game's soundtrack for ages and not get tired of it. It has a personal touch compared to other Rockstar games. The storyline is as follows. You are Jimmy Hopkins, the 'bad-boy' at Bullworth Academy, and have been expelled from numberous schools in the past, you are being kept in the boarding school, Bullworth Academy, while your mother and step-dad are going on a year-long honeymoon. As expected, Jimmy hates this new school. What is his plan? To take over it. Not to bully, as the name suggests, but to put the hateful greasers, preps, jocks, nerds and bullies in their places.  The game includes a class system, meaning that he has different classes throughout the school day. He has one in the morning and another in the afternoon with a break for lunch. You can choose to either skip a class or attend it. Skipping the class will lead to prefects chasing you if they find you. Being caught too many times will give you a detention, where you perform chores. Attending the class will lead to a minigame depending on the subject, if you fail you will have to retake the minigame the next time you have the class, if you succeed you will get either outfits or weapons like stinkbombs or slingshots for Jimmy. Once you complete a class 5 times you will pass it and no longer have to attend it. The game itself is one of my favourites. It includes numerous secrets inside it and is overall enjoyable even when you have completed it plenty of times. So, what could it do to improve if there's a future game?: -A bigger boys' dorm, just a detail I would love in the game. The boy's dorm is basically a shack with a few rooms and a place with a tv. The girls' dorm however is basically a big 2 story house with shower rooms and an accessible attic. This idea is unrealistic as there are more boys in the game than girls. -First person. I love first person games, they let you step into the character rather than just play with them. If Bully was first person I would love this game even more. -Smarter AI. In this game, you could punch a little kid multiple times in one day. The next day what does the kid do? He doesn't run away, just says 'Hello!'. This could be really nice if it could work with the different groups in this game, so you can be with the preps but hate the greasers, or be a jock and hate the nerds. I understand that Jimmy is supposed to find these different societies dumb, but it would be a really cool feature.  Do I reccommend this game? Yes, yes and yes. It's an amazing game. It's basically high school GTA. Story could be a bit longer, but the game overall is great and you are missing out if you haven't played this game.",

The main character attends a school whose population is divided into factions (nerds, jocks, rich kids, etc) and as you play through missions you'll gain or lose respect from the different factions but the player has no control over it.

There is quite a lot to do between missions, collectibles, and mini games. I was able to get 97% completion within 50 hours so it's a fairly long experience, probably longer if you feel like messing around in it instead of going straight from one objective to the next.   Combat is clunky, only hit and grapple, and most bosses are invulnerable to grapple. So it's button mashing hit most of the time. You do get combat upgrades that are just holding down hit after x amounts of button mashing it, but it's all largely irrelevant.   For me it was enjoyable up until end game, then all that was left was reoccurring boring mini games, and directionless mischief in the sandbox.

It could have been longer, having the plot like this it could be extended up to 30 hours, but it is what it is. Myths do a minor thing here, unlike GTA, one or two myths at best. There are collectibles scattered across the map, required to get for 100% completion, but really boring to catch. When you finish the game you can attend classes and pass them, you can finish missions you didn't before, do errands that you didn't, free roam, and explore some myths (minor thing). If you think it would be ok to give this amount (I got this on a sale of 75% at the moment) for up to 20 hours of gameplay, you're good to go. If you like games that are longer, up to 50-100 hours, this isn't for you. My final word is, buy it, but be prepared for a fast paced game. A great journey it was. 10/10.",

New kid Jimmy Hopkins must make his place among the bullies, nerds and jocks of Bullworth Academy, making allies and enemies while pulling pranks and getting into fights.   Pros : The game is large enough, beginning with the Academy, but opening more of the town as you play. There's plenty of missions to go through and characters to interact with. Pulls a lot of humor and setting from 1990s kids TV show stereotypes.   Cons : This game is a bad PC port that plays awfully without a game pad. The graphics lost all their charms with age. The story isn't involving, having none of the sarcastic flair other Rockstar games such as the   Grand Theft Auto   franchise has, so there is little to no reason to revisit it once you've played through it.   Verdict : ★★☆☆☆ - Forget it  I take my nostalgia goggles off and look at it from a fresh perspective, and find little interest. I scratch my head wondering why I found it appealing some years ago, but will not be going back to  Bully: Scholarship Edition  again.  —————————————————————————   This was just my opinion.

The PC version is a mess. Running on my 760, the game flashes black screens and stutters. Running on my i5's intergrated graphics, it's flawless. The keyboard support is a mess but I have X360 controllers on hand so that doesn't bother me but for those without that could be a deal breaker.  So, You've been warned.

That would be what Bully is.  I wish I could recommend it. I wish I could say its better because it's unique and can be a lot of fun, but it does get a bit stale by the middle of the game.  Gameplay wise, the missions are what you would guess. You egg houses, raid panties, french girls and all the stuff you'd expect from something of this genre. You learn different melee moves and you get ranged weapons, both of which are useful in many cases. There is a bit of variety in missions, but some of the missions are the same as in previous chapters, just with a difference of location and enemy. Also, something really, really annoying: Sometimes if you fail a mission you will not get the chance to do it until the next day. I know the game has to punish you for failing, but I would have preferred to just restart the mission.  The story kind of wore on me after a while. I didn't really get attached to any of the characters because they wheeled them around like I was riding a rollercoaster past everyone in the school. I wasn't too thrilled that I had to go through all the factions pretty much doing the same types of missions in order to boost my reputation with them. There was a bit of predictability. I didn't really laugh as much as I would have expected from a comedy game. Though, the ending did get me super psyched and that made up for a lot of confusion during the middle of the game. It feels like you lose the purpose of the game near the middle.  The open world seems small at first glance, but it is designed excellently. There's a lot of nooks and crannies to get lost in. There's a few collectibles, but not the obscene amount that you see in most open world games.  The music is quite unique as well. The soundtrack is usually dominated by bass guitar with xylophone paired with celeste, which gives it a feel all its own. The problem is that some of the tracks aren't looped well and you'll be listening to 10 second clips stop then start again.  Also, in regards to the sound design, some of the dialogue, which is excellent, is drowned out by the sound effects and you'll frequently find yourself straining to listen.  I did run into one bug that caused the game to get stuck in a cutscene. I had to reload from an earlier point and that sucked.  I really want to recommend this game, but it has its share of problems. If you're looking for something different this isn't a terrible choice, but bear in mind that this game has a LOT of annoying issues.",

It seemed like the game could have been fun, but the poor controls and UI mission system really made me feel annoyed the whole time I played it.  The missions they 'force' you to do are strange/lame and 'out of character' things. Example: Help some nerd use the restroom, it is a forced mission. If you fail because you do not know the entire map layout or because the mission UI navigation is lame.... You must keep trying the same lame mission: only next time you try it, it will have Teacher Aids chasing you because it is night time or during class hours causing you to fail and do it again -  People randomly fight you, feels like Jimmy is tank, ect:  I am certain that it is just me and that nothing is wrong with this game but I honestly tried for almost an hour and a half to play this game but between the controls, forced missions, and poor UI.... I just couldn't take it. Perhaps another day.",

If you want to buy it, buy it physically, it also may be a lot cheaper than buying it on Steam.",
