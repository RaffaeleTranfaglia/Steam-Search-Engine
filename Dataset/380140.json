            "review_text": "The Secret of Tremendous Corporation is a pretty neat point and click adventure game. The art is pretty unique in that it is almost entirely based on doodles and rough shading. The music is pretty good as well, and overall I would recommend The Secret of Tremendous Corporation to anyone who is a fan of free point and click adventure games. That sounds pretty niche but I like to think there is an audience for this kind of thing.   Story wise The Secret of Tremendous Corporation puts you in the shoes of a new intern of a corporation that has almost completely dominated the gaming industry, and you are eventually tasked with discovering its secrets and what not. The game itself is pretty short but id say it was well made enough to warrant a look if you are interested.",

            "review_text": "it's a very stylised little point-and-click game. I give it a positive quite simply because there is a DLC hat that you can buy for, and the game even has an opportunity for you to make fun of yourself with that hat, and then you get mocked for wearing it when you tell someone that you bought the get hat on steam, in game.  there's a bunch of other in jokes, and references. 'This is not the secret that you are looking for' (Star Wars) the main character makes a reference to an all-encompassing AI that likes testing its' subjects, and how well things ended for her.  I don't Wanna spoiler.  a couple of the puzzles are a little bit frustrating and the answers are somewhat obtuse, but the play style is very linear, so you could watch a walk-through online up to where you're up to, and get the answer to the bit you're stuck on, pause it and keep going in game.  Make sure that you try all of the alternative answers, before the one that you 'think should be the right one' that's where the gems are in this game.",

Graphics   I had no problem at all with the graphics - in fact I kind of liked the style. There's even animation! Bravo!    Story   A bit silly, but a fun kind of silly. The language was subpar though. Wish the developers could've got someone whose native language was English to vet through all the captions, as the phrasing and grammar occasionally spoiled the effect of what was trying to be communicated.    Puzzles   This was a short game, but it still managed to fit in some OK adventure puzzles. One logic puzzle near the end took me quite a while to figure out - so fun!  Overall this was a good experience and a pleasant way to spend about 30 minutes.",

The total game-play is only 1-2 hours (depending on how much you dink around) so don't expect some polished masterpiece, but it's great for just relaxing. The drawings are great, the animation not so much: simply the main charectar's walking can give you a headache if you focus too much on it. For the most part, though, this is a sweet game (especially since it's free!).",
