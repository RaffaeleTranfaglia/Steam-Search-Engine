            "review_text": "I came here with the purpose of finding a game I didn't like and seeing if it was worth a negative review. Glad I came back to this one. As it turns out, its a rough diamond.  Its a jarring game to play initially. We are so used to knowing what a shooter is and what a platformer is. When a game like Bionic Commando denies us a jump button then it becomes very stressful. My advice is do the tutorials and attempt the challenge rooms within the friendly zones first.  They will teach you the mechanics and you will quickly be able to move fluidly the way you want to and be a true bionic commando, instead of a slow clunky frustrated commando wondering what you are doing.  The swing mechanics of the bionic arm are very fun once you take a few minutes to get used to them, and you will be taking on platforms and bad guys with ease quickly. You won't even mind not having a jump button after you've figured it all out.  Level progression is a bit different too. Area 0 is a friendly zone that must be entered to find the tutorial, and Area 1 must be entered to find the challenge rooms that put into practice more of the advanced skills.  You won't initially know where to go, but by exploring the areas you can access you will eventually build up a handy arsenal of equipment and knowledge of the game. I highly recommend exploring all the friendly zone to start with and entering the rooms to collect useful equipment as well as getting used to moving around outside of combat. After you've comfortably explored the friendly areas and rooms, tackle the nearby accessable low numbered areas and dominate those enemies in combat.  As an example of a time where you will be initially confused, you need to explore a friendly zone to get the flares you need to more easily explore Area 4. The level can still possibly be completed, but you will get frustrated wondering why an early level has you zipping about blind trying to find a random platform or bit of wall you need to succeed. Turns out exploration of a friendly zone was the answer and only one I discovered by accident after getting frustrated and quitting out to try another stage.  Bosses are in every enemy stage, and there is a great mechanic where you can hack enemy consoles for a chance of learning the boss weakness. I found the early bosses to be easy enough that I didn't get frustrated and wanted to keep playing. Beating bosses earns you more gear as well as more levels to play with so its a rewarding experience.  There are also enemy trucks zipping about the world map also give you a chance to play a different kind of shooting game and experiment with weapons. Its a bit repetitive, but a fun distraction between the main game.  In conclusion, Bionic Commando Rearmed is definitely a game that tries something different and succeeds. If you can cope with it being different, put in that half an hour to learn how to play the game. There is a real treat lying ahead for you.  EDIT: I'll admit later levels and challenges do become frustrating so just enjoy the fun bits.",

            "review_text": "I'll start this review by simply saying that Bionic Commando Rearmed is the best platformer game on Steam, hands down.  BCR was developed by a swedish studio called GRIN, they had previously made the Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter games which were 'okay'. But in 2008 they really hit the motherload with this one, the game is an HD remake of the original NES game 'Bionic Commando' and not does it only add more content to the mix, but even refines the original experience making it a superior version to the classic.  In BCR you play as Nathan Spencer, a 'Bionic Commando' with a giant robotic arm that operates as a telescopic grappling hook you can launch in five different directions, making it perfect for flinging around like Spider-Man. (Or Tarzan, but let's face it, nobody thinks Tarzan is cool anymore.)  But there is a twist! You cant jump, the reason for this was originally the fact that the NES controller only had the A + B buttons which most games used for different actions. Shooting took the other button and grappling hook the other, meaning there werent enough buttons for jumping. For this reason, the developers had to get the level design absolutely perfect for the game to work, and oh boy did they succeed. The level design in Bionic Commando is still one of the best in any platformer game still to this day.  What about the music? Well simply put it's AMAZING, after finishing the game twice i dont think there is a single bad track in the entire OST of the game. Even the originals from the NES game sound amazing, but they really did the remastering well in this one.  If i'd have to give the game some criticism, (which is really hard btw) it would probably be the PC porting. While it certainly is superior to the other versions in terms of graphical fidelity, rebindable keys and proper sound settings, it's lacking an option for enabling vsync. This doesn't sound so bad at first, but when you realize that your rig is capable of running the game in ludicrous speed (I had about 400-470 FPS during the entire game) it can cause serious issues with overheating in your GPU.  All in all, BCR is one helluva masterpiece of platformers and one of the brightest moments in Crapcom's history, if they only had hired these guys to remake the old Mega Man games...  The game sells for 8,99€ on Steam and for that price i can certainly recommend you buying it. The game offers about eight hours of gameplay, but that number might vary depending on how much you have played platformers before or if you wish to complete the challenge missions. It should also be noted that the game is a remake of something that was on NES, so the replay value is pretty much endless.  Lastly, GRIN was shut down in 2009 after their commercial failure with the new Bionic Commando game, (I'll talk about that a bit later) and because they had multiple projects going on at the same time, even though publishers were delaying their payments. Most of the GRIN development team went ahead to start a new development studio called 'Overkill Software', sounds familiar? Yeah, these are the same guys who made the Payday games.  One last thing, the last boss of this game is Adolf Hitler, yeah.",

The fact that this amazing Commando can only aim horizontaly (at 90 degrees) and can not jump seems perplexing. The story is non existent. The graphics look ok, at best (not that i care too much about graphics when good gameplay is present.)  All in all, certain games should remain in the past. This is for people looking for a challenge and who are willing to learn a frustrating, antiquated, control system. Almost any new game is better than this. Gave up after 3.4 hours of playing. 3/10  P.S. Doesn't even work out out of the box. Needs the manual searching and installation of old PHYSx drivers to even get into this. Poor.",

            "review_text": "To all of you who loved the original Bionic Commando on the NES, this is the remake of your lives. I know that the game industry should be more creative on their own, but this one is really worth it.   To those less familiar with the original, let me take you on a magical journey - a journey through the world of 2-D platforming. Since before Mario jumped his first goomba, Jumping has been a  thing  in gaming. Jump up to reach the platforms, jump across gaps. In most games you even get some kind of gimmick, like shooting in Megaman, or your whip in Castlevania. But after some time, jumping and shooting and such was getting very much mainstream. It didn't make a memorable game by itself anymore. So, Capcom, fueled by the successes of Megaman and Street Fighter, made a move that only the geniuses that they were at the time could have pulled off.  They removed jumping.   Yep. Just took jumping out of a platformer. Just *shoop* Don't need you today jumping. See ya in the next Megaman.  I can just imagine the reaction in the meetings: 'Why?! Why by all that is holy would you remove the most basic element of an action-adventure platformer?!'  I'll tell you why. To put in something much better. Rather that go with the overused jumping mechaincs, they gave you a grapling hook arm, and introduced a  swing  mechanic. Yes. SWINGING. It may be a little awkward and counterintuitive at first. You may fall into that first pit a dozen times. But keep going, and it suddenly clicks, and you turn into a greenish blur swing through the stages with skill to put Tarzan to shame. Were the folks at Capcom insane? Yes. Were they geniuses? Also yes.  But that's not all. Though the story is linear, it gives you an overworld map with a Metriodvania style of exploration. Add to this already unique game one of the best original soundtracks 8-bit games have ever seen, and you got yourself one of the greatest gems the NES has ever offered us.  But that's the NES game. Here we have the 'Rearmed' version. And, long story short, it is  incredible . Take all of those things that made the original great, and add spectacular 2.5-D graphics, additional mechanics to excite the modern gamer, enhanced soundtrack that still remains true to the original, fun cutscene artwork, a co-op mode, and enough nostalgia tripping to bring a happy tear to the every eye in the collective community of NES gamers, and you get  one  great  game.   Now to be fair, there are a couple of con's here. To maintain the nostalgia factor, they kept the threadbare story from the original, updating it slightly to flow a little more smoothly. So if you're into in-depth storyline games, you're not gonna get much here. It's pretty cut-and-dry. Kill badguys, get cool stuff, kill more badguys, save the day.  And, like I mentioned above, the swinging takes some getting used to. You have to be pretty precise at some points, so you'll need some patience to develop the skill. Probably not the best thing for a casual gamer.  But all in all, this is a wonderful reboot.   The great thing is that this 2008 release was obviously meant to build excitement and hype for the 2009 realease of a full 3-D Bionic Commando game. So, we basically got a great game with new life breathed into it for the sake of advertising.      ",

No longer is this game running on 8 bits anymore but surprisingly on my old dual core laptop with a Nivida graphic card the game ran slow. But Bionic Commando was one of the top games for me at the time. Now with a new twist, this Bionic Commando Rearmed plays almost exactly as the orignal. A difinite plus if you can believe that but now with bosses! This upgraded version painfully tries not to alienate the orignal and does it sucessfully. The new graphics are nice but they can only go so far without breaking out of the 2-D mold of the orignal. This is a real feat as the developers bring a game as dated a Bionic Commando to todays standards without completely remaking it into a entirely new game. I've never seen a retro game redone with this much forethough and careful treading before. This is definitely one of the best remakes of an old classic I've ever seen and recommend this game, even if you have never of Bionic Commando before. The challenge of this game is unique.

You have to figure out way to progress through the areas by using your grappling hook for everything. They did a really good job with it too.",

Reminded me of contra only without the ability to jump and having to relie on a grapple to jump around XD  Verdict: 3/10  Pros: •reminded me of contra  cons: •needs ability to jump •Get rid of that grapple •umm ability to laydown only crouch",

If you're an old school gamer like myself and love capcom games maybe just go with Mega Man ???  Not saying Bionic Commando is bad or anything along those lines but it could have been better and the controls could have been better as-well.  I'd give it a 5.5 out of 10... Not just because the game is boring or the controls are terrible... I had to download NVIDIA PHYSX SYSTEM SOFTWARE... Without downloading that crap it wouldn't work, well I had installed the most up-to-date driver for my video card yet I still needed to download that crap. Eh, 5.5 out of 10 for that crap..   Eh since the game does in-fact run and is playable I would recommend people to try it. My taste isn't the same as everyone else.   ",
