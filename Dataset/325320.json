            "review_text": "So, as I was writing this review, I switched my recommendation from yes to no and back about three times.  Consider this a very conflicted 'yes', with a lot of qualifiers.  For example: $1 is about what you want to spend on Mythos: the Beginning. Allow me to explain why.  Mythos is a survival horror rpg with heavy-handed Lovecraftian elements. It's a very short game (clocking in at about three hours, playing as a completionist, on the hardest difficulty) so long as you don't get stuck, but it's also got puzzles and lacks a walkthrough, so your mileage may vary.   In Mythos, you investigate a semi-condemned asylum/hospital/thing, skulking around in the dark and occasionally falling through the floor to your death. The game is class-based, and it lets you freely spend exp in safe rooms to progress your character's combat abilities and investigative chops. Raise your int stat high enough (60) and you can bypass every puzzle in the game. Raise your sense stat high enough, and hidden items start appearing on the floor around you. Stats are reasonably well balanced, and most character builds are viable. So long as you build high int and throw spells, or build high attack and hit rate. Some combats can be optionally sidestepped, but a lot of monsters on the map clip towards you at just barely sub-sonic speeds, making evasion unlikely. Monsters and investigation points are also your primary source of exp, so I found myself combing the asylum for every squamous horror I could locate in order to make my intestines stronger. Optionally, you can also spend items for exp, which was kind of a neat feature. I mulched my entire inventory into my statline and promptly discovered I did not need to be healed when my defense was so high that I could not be hurt.  Which brings me to game balance. Mythos is a little wonky in this regards. Played properly, it probably is a nail-biting exercise in inventory management. However, exp costs for stats progress based on how many save rooms you have discovered, not on how many points you have spent, so I just scooped every single point I could find in the first few areas and made myself indestructible before even seeing a boss. If I hadn't decided to spend points to pad the survivability of my companions, I would have breezed through the final act of the game too.  Regarding raising any of the stats on your companions: don't. Them dying in combat has no actual repercussions whatsoever, so just use them as one-hit distractions for the monsters. Get your luck and guts high enough, and status effects and damage will not touch you.  Mythos' design also falters when it comes to its graphics and voice acting. The rest of the sound design on the game is utterly lovely, and evokes just the right atmosphere, but I've never seen worse (and buggier) voice-work. Everyone you meet sounds like they're trying to force a British accent through a sieve of rusting fish-hooks and razors, and that in turn is wrapped in some kind of low-fidelity distortion that made me take off my headphones every time someone spoke. I believe you can turn voiced dialog off, but you have to go into a menu in the game. Which means the intro voiceing is probably unskippable.   Graphics are not much better. This is an RPGmaker title. It shows. On top of that, all the character portraits and monsters look like they were whipped up using some sort of 1991 home edition 3D modeling software. It's garish at best, and comical at worst.  So, what's good about this game? Why did I eventually switch back to a 'yes' rating?  Unfortunately, it's fun.  I genuinely enjoyed most of my three hours playing it, and I even managed to get kind of immersed in the story and ambiance a few times. Mythos does not outstay its welcome (I'd say it understays it), and I found myself thinking about it after it was over - and not just in a 'what did I put in my brain?' kind of way.  I don't think this was because of the writing, which was bog-standard Lovecraftiana. I don't think it was strictly the gameplay either. But somehow the whole of Mythos is greater than the sum of its jumbled-together parts. Dollar-for-dollar, I wouldn't take it over Alien or Amnesia, but if you want to support a pretty cool indie dev or slum it with a project-on-a-budget, you could do worse than this.",

            "review_text": "I could have recommended the previous version without the 'remastered' combat. It just changed into a normal RPG with the caveat that you were now looking for ways to exploit whatever XP you could get, whenever you could get it. Purposely choosing skill gains in an order to get the most XP you can gain and such. Additionally, the Healing skills are way more valuable than their cost and turn healing items into things that are better off being exchanged for XP. I just don't know how to fix that without making the problem worse.   It's not a 'bad' game, and quite frankly doesn't deserve the negative recommendation, but there is no 'meh' option for more of the same. Otherwise, the extra DLC that was added did help the overall thematic elements of the game.  ",
