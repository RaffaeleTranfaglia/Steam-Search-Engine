            "review_text": "I really enjoyed the humor, and the effects are nice too. But most of all the ease of play has been increased manyfold.  -Moe Kills used to be a touch-and-go affair, but now you get a meter that predicts the amount of moe you will inflict, plus some percentile chances of an increased or decreased effect.  -Linked moves are now in your ability pool, so you can just use basic attack if you wish.  -The Mugen Field (AKA Level-Grind-Up-To-Overleveled-As-F**k) now has rest stops that you can heal up at and take a breather before continuing, or even get a free out if you feel over your head.  -Mini Chou-Chou  -Character models in general are greatly improved, and even move their mouths when talking.  -Same old dirty humor.  Overall I give this game an Undisputed God out of 10. Take that as you will.",
