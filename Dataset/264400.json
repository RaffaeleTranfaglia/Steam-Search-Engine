            "review_text": "If you're a fan of the Professor Layton games on the DS, then give this charming title a look. Although it borrows (read: steals) a few of the mechanics from that series-- such as the merit points awarded and finding soda cans instead of hint coins (which fulfill the same purpose)-- this is by no means a bad thing. The world is also beautiful to look at and explore, filled with some very amusing characters with genuinely funny dialogue. Despite the game's shortness-- with just 24 puzzles and the story included-- Â£4 is good value for what you get, with more promised by the developer to come soon. Despite being somewhat inferior to the Layton series, this is still worth your time if you're craving some lighthearted puzzle action.  PROS: +Stylish graphics make the game look great +Charming characters with funny dialogue to boot +Puzzles are more challenging than the art style suggests +Cheap  CONS -Suspiciously similar mechanics to the Layton series -Some difficulty in clicking on soda cans when Jacob blocks view of them -Short in length -Writing memos can be somewhat tricky with a mouse  Overall score: 7/10, would recommend",

            "review_text": "  I haven't finished it but it is a great puzzle game. Akin to Puzzle Agent, this game has tons of little puzzles scattered across the path the discorvering to mysteries. It's a nice game for $5 and it's seems like you get what you pay for (which isn't saying it's bad). I suggest you play this with others, it will make everything better and solving puzzles with your pals 'ish da best'. Thanks to Supreme Nazi Commander Elite for buying me both episodes.",
