            "review_text": "I'm just at the beginning of the game but I must say that it already has more than impressed me. The art style is just beautiful and I just happen to really like the concept of this game. It is cute but at the same time disturbing and cruel, dealing with serious and complex topics like mental illness, psychological and physical abuse an murder. Additionally, this is full of pretty weird and morbid creatures that reminds me of Tim Burton's work.   It is clearly visible that this game was made with a lot of care and love. As far as I understood, Killmonday barely consists of two members who created this little gem all by themselves. This leaves me even more impressed and you can clearly tell the difference by the personal effort they put in it in comparision to big game developers who create games in mass production.  So if you like point and click adventures that are not AAA-title-polished but have their very own beautiful style and if you have strong nerves to deal with the twisted themes in this game, I can only recommend you to buy this game and help Killmonday sell this game well so we can look forward to many new interesting games from them in the future!",

            "review_text": "Fran Bow is a very unique game. What starts as surreal and terrifying only escaltes. It took me aback several times with how creative and strange it could be. Beautiful music, art, and writing all come together to make a game unlike any I've played before. It's not for the faint of heart, with geninely upsetting themes like suicide, abortion, medical abuse, sexual abuse etc, so be wary of that.  The puzzles stumped me several times but, never to the point where I gave up. There's always just enough information (except for one or two parts) to keep you going, to keep searching.  A cross between charming and bizzare, between horror and fantasy, this is a lovely game.  It reminds me of The Cat Lady for many reasons; dark story, creative themes, point and click etc.   The ending left me feeling a bit...lacking? I think I understand everything that happened and it is nice to have a 'happy' ending and know that Fran will be okay, but I guess as the player I would like to see her being alright.",

            "review_text": "Fran Bow is one of those games that changes your opinion of life after you play it. Very few games have achieved making me feel this way about them. The gameplay is very gory, but contains a concept that was completely new to me and facinating in the way it is executed. Playing as a 11 year old girl struggling within her own mind. Being told everything through direct thoughts made it much more immersive. I never really knew who to trust. Every object had several sentences of dialogue. I triple clicked on every object, read everything there was to read to see all of her reactions. I'm also planning on re-playing this again to catch what I might have missed which I rarely do. That's how magnificent of a game this is. Playing as Fran really made me enjoy every minute of it too. What I didn't expect is you will play as other characters as you go along when Fran isn't available. Her opinion on simple objects made this game so much more interesting for me. There is plenty of symbolism that tell side stories of the children you're first introduced to. I am so happy Killmonday took the time to include them within the story. It really gave a great deal of emotion and helped influence the mood. The mystery is what really kept me playing. Answers are weaved within the story instead of only at the end. New mysterys are made when old ones are answered. Small hints are everywhere but usually vague, you'll understand them eventually. I really enjoyed making those connections. The puzzles can be difficult but to me makes them much more satisfying to solve. Some unexpected mini games appeared which made playing very entertaining. If you're into mysterious and gory point and click adventures you seriously NEED to get this game, it is outstanding!",

            "review_text": "So to be fair i did not know what to expect of Fran Bow. But after the first cut scene and realise that there was so many horror element in the lore of the game that i knew that i was about to experience something special. Creepy at first, we are presented with real life horror element such has ♥♥♥♥ and pedofila. Fran Bow does a great job in subtaly integrating these dark theme into its lore without overdoing it..  There was a time were artistic stop motion was a thing (wait you will get were i am going with this) were it was all about the craftsmanship and the facial expression coming to life frame by frame. Well Fran bow would have been an amazing stop motion movie. The character design are reminiscent of Tim burtons early work (Yes there was a time were my friend Burton was actually a good filmmaker) and the The creatures design are absolutely incredible. But i am happy that Fran bow is a game because it is reminding me of why i love the stop motion art in general.  Back to game at hand, i will say this if you are a fan of american mcgee Alice and you have been craving for a proper sequel and hate tim burton version of alice in wonderland. Then Fran bow should be the does of medication you have been craving for.   With that said there are it's fault some of the puzzle designed are weirdly designed. 95% percent can be solved if you pay attention to the level designed but i found my self looking at a guide for 2 of them that i won't detail them because i wouldn't want to reveal any spoiler. With that said that a problem with 90 % of the point and click genre in general so that not a big issue. Some of the mini game are fun but feel force and unnecessary, they do offer some interesting art style.   9.1/10 Verdict: Dark, Creepy and Underated. If you are a fan of point and click games Fran Bow is worth a full price Steam purchase.",

The Point and Click mechanics are perfect and simple, it does not weird you out with hard controls or anything. Killmonday has smash all the good stuff of Point and Click games and make something very fun the play. I found the story very sweet, cool and sad but beautiful. At the end I really care about Fran and to see her happy after all the misery she has to put up with. The story has a bit of everything itself, is not just only psychological horror, there also some other things that are very different of what we see in the beginning but it holds to the story and stills connected to it.  I recommend Fran Bow to everybody that loves video games that try go for something new and exciting and to connect to people in a very personal way. If you are one of those people that love art in video games, you have a lot of see here... Everythings has so much detail, is crazy!!*",

It includes many serious circumstances aswell as being a well styled and cool puzzel game it has a lovely idea based around time itself, human perception and our darkest fears. The story line is vague but still comes through at the end. There is always a plot twist or surprise waiting and all in all one of the bestest adventure games Ive ever played. Then after all those awesome features it also has the aspect of horror. Literally quite spooky at times. No actual Jump scares or anything, mainly blood etc aswell as having to work through the horror by taking the pills given to you in the game to work through puzzels is another amazing aspect of the game too. I hope everyone else enjoys this game as much as I have. I fully Recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "*Semi-Spoilers*  I apologize to the creators for not recommending this obvious labor of love. Fran Bow has a lot going for it and earns the (nowadays) rare distinction of being a game I actually played until the end. Which means that amidst all these hundreds of games that fail to hold my attention or engage me sufficiently to be 'beaten' this one persevered only to reward me with... nothing.  No conclusion, no reveal, no explanation, no closure.  Some people enjoy this sort of thing; going online afterwards to discuss their interpretations and theories about events that unfolded. I can even agree with this and relate to it up to a point. I just can't help but feel Fran Bow took it a bit too far leaving _everything_ up to the player. Was it all a dream? Was half of it a dream? 25% dream? Is there one single 'fact' in this story anchored to reality or is everything fluid and left to your imagination?   When I read a novel I like to imagine that the author had this burning desire to share their story with me; that everything they put into writing was more or less important to the story or the setting or the mood. There will be some ambiguity or some uncertainty - certain facts will be left up to your imagination and make the story better for it.  Here, you might as well just grab a cup of your favorite beverage, sit down comfortably and use these following keywords to make up your own story in your head:  Little Girl, Insane Asylum, Dead Parents, Medicine, Psychosis,  Did you do it? There you go, whatever you made up in your head can most likely fill in for what 'actually' happened in Fran Bow.",

I think this game is a must to every Alice Madness Returns &amp; / or Point &amp; Click Fan.  If you are however not a fan oh those kinda games, I think you should try it out either way. The Story is scary but also very nice. It sometimes will proof you wrong when you think you are right.

            "review_text": "Horror as a genre requires a particularly elegant approach to be successful. It is certainly possible to scare someone through blunt manipulation of disturbing images and a reliance on proven tropes, but horror that lingers, sticking to its audience like the aftermath of a bad dream, that takes something more. To its credit, Fran Bow initially understands this to a level that is truly chilling. But as developer Killmonday Games takes on more and more plotlines, shuffling the player deeper into an incomprehensible madness, Fran Bow falls inside the depths of a convoluted narrative mess from which it is never able to crawl back out of.  Beginning within the bloodstained hallways of a children’s mental institution, Fran Bow has access to no shortage of unsettling narratives and images to pull from, drawing heavily from horrific historical medical practices and occult imagery to craft an aggressively grim premise. 10 years old going on 11, the eponymous Fran Bow is plagued by violent images of her parent’s slaughter. Trapped now in a categorically inhumane asylum, her day to day life consists of being carted from psychiatric evaluations to routine drug administrations, forcing her madness back into her mind and leaving her in a vegetative state. Her one out from this hellish existence comes in the form of a bottle of red pills, which upon ingesting allows Fran to see her grotesque visions manifest in the real world, in the process instructing her on how to escape and setting her off on a quest to find her cat and only friend, Mr. Midnight.  Setting aside its narrative baggage, Fran Bow operates on what can be considered two distinct levels. The first is that of a decidedly traditional adventure game, with a heavy focus on jerry-rigging items together in order to solve an inordinate amount of inscrutable puzzles. Fran Bow makes little sense by design, but while this is largely excusable in a narrative drawing heavily from the likes of Alice in Wonderland (and even more so the macabre video game reimagining, Alice: Madness Returns) it effectively turns each puzzle into an inventory jigsaw puzzle as the player is left to attempt to combine items until something clicks into place. This is made all the worse due to Fran Bow’s level design, which assembles a collection of screens for the player to scavenge through as they slowly chip away at a levels exterior until being whisked away to the next hub. At its best, Fran Bow’s puzzles are tedious and archaic, and at their worst they completely break the game’s façade and reveal the rusty gears grinding to a halt underneath.  Somehow more unpleasant to contend with, however, is Fran Bow’s second chief objective: to be as grotesque and violent as possible within the span of 7-8 hours. Fran Bow’s morbid tendencies should be readily apparent to anyone who has seen any portion of the game, but what screenshots don’t relay as readily as playing the game does is how quickly Fran Bow’s violence and gore becomes routine. It is nauseating, to be sure, but there is never any method to Fran Bow’s madness. It wants to shock and appall, but solely for the sake of proving how depraved it is. And that’s perhaps all well and good to a certain subset of player, but the point at which Fran Bow quit attempting to justify its perversions was the point they stopped being effective. Fran Bow’s horrors fail because on some level they never really aim to be horrific. At most Fran Bow seems to seek to establish a palpable unease, but the anxiety it manages to create is so constant that it can only sustain itself so long before even the sight of bodies diced and organs strewn about elicits little more than a moderate cringe.  If Fran Bow had anything more to offer beyond these two elements it might be possible to dismiss them as tolerable gripes, but at some point roughly halfway through the game, it becomes distressingly clear that Fran Bow is just as lost as the player is confused where they are being taken. From the third chapter of five onward, Fran Bow takes aggressive, woefully conceptualized measures to arrive at something approximating a conclusion. Alternate realities and timelines are employed, split personalities are discovered, characters are drawn out of the air with elaborate backstories in hand, and proceedings become radically more unhinged as the game buckles under the weight of a plot that feels more false and contrived than any of Fran’s visions. Fran Bow begins as a mysterious if meandering horror adventure game, but by its conclusion, adopts the worst narrative conventions of bad fantasy and sci-fi to form a genre blending monstrosity that is all too eager to write off every inexplicable story beat as mere madness when it is more convenient than an explanation.  Fran Bow begins with the trappings of a deliberate authorship, but by its conclusion becomes so enamored with introducing new characters and plotlines to support ones which were never well developed to begin with, that the whole game falls in upon itself. On an artistic and conceptual level, Killmonday Games are experts at finding ways to capture the players’ attention and compel them forward, but when every path leads to a deus ex machina and an exposition dump long enough to chock on, it’s hard to feel anything but regret for having gone down them.

I bought this game during the Steam Halloween sale. I saw the screenshots of the art style and saw the 'overwhelmingly positive' review rating and thought it might be worth my time to try it out. After finishing it, I must say, this game doesn't disappoint.  First off, the art in this game is utterly amazing. It very much resembles the hand drawn art you'd find in a children's storybook. That's actually what makes it so interesting as well because the story of the game itself almost contradicts the storybook art style. In fact, the game gets quite dark and gory at parts. This is what I think makes this game quite unique.  Of course, the excellent music and sound effects also share some success in helping to set up the mood for each scene as well.  All in all, excellent story, wonderful characters, great puzzles throughout, and overall a thoroughly entertaining game even if it is a bit on the dark side.  ",

            "review_text": "This was a very freaky game, in the good way. It starts like a normal story, but then... It gets weird. REALLY weird. I really recommand it due to the good sides, though there are some bad sides that I think you should know before you buy.  The good sides: - The horror story is really good, and gets more interesting as you play. The boring parts (mainly chapter 3) still have beautiful scenes to keep you interested. - The story is mostly not predictable, cause most of the things that happen during the game are SO weird that you couldn't guess them unless you saw screenshots/videos before playing. - The graphics are amazing, the drwaings are really good and evil, and there are a lot of great scenes. I think the design is pretty perfect, even though personally I would give up the black blurry frame that covers the whole game. - The story manages to be pretty original, which is hard to do with the idea of 'a person wakes up in the asylum' that we have seen in many movies/games before. - If you happen to have any technical problems, the moderators in the forum are really helpful in helping you solve them.  The bad sides: - The game is VERY easy to figure out, as you are being told exactly what you need to do during the whole game. The puzzles are easy as well, there are barely any chat options, and overall you can't really fail or get anything wrong in this game. You don't need to explore too much in order to find the solution to everything, and most of the game you just watch things happen like a movie, so there isn't really any challange. This game is clearly made for adults and not for kids, so I thought it would be much harder. On the bright side though, at least the story itself is good enough to still keep you interested. - There is no voice acting for the characters, which feels a bit outdated for a point and click game that was made on 2015. Most of the story feels like watching a muted movie with subtitles, which could work for other type of games, but with point and click the whole game is based on listening to the characters. I feel like the game could be 10 times better if it did have voice acting. - Taking screenshots in this game is really complicated at the moment and doesn't work at the normal way, which is very annoying, mainly because the scenes are so beautiful and creepy that it makes you wanna screenshot the whole game. - Unlike other point and click games, on this one you can't save different points of the game in order to come back to them later. The only options you have are to continue your last gameplay, start a new game (which will delete your last gameplay), and start a chapter of your choice from the beginning. This is not very comfortable, especially if you click something by mistake, or if you miss achivements. - The main character does not have enough reactions to the scary things, including things that involve her dead parents. She is like, ok with everything, or maybe a bit angry for a moment, but the only thing she really cares about is her cat. In some points at the game it's not really believable for a 10 years old girl to simply not care or react to things. - Sadly the scary and horror scenes really repeat themselves, and even though those are great scenes, they get a bit boring after a while. There are a few that will still surprise you, but most of them just repeat in different locations.  Accoring to the credits, this game was mostly made by just two people, which is very impressive when you look at the result. I would sure want to check out their next game if they ever make any, though I hope they would fix the above problems if they do.",

Let's see...in this game you play as a young girl (Fran Bow); her parents have been brutaly murdered and she's in a mental hospital. From there, she escapes in the hope to find her cat and return home to her aunt. You do this in classic adventure style of clicking on everything in the hope to either get it into your inventory and/or finding combinations that progress the storyline. So far, things are standard. Pretty soon, however, you'll get a bottle with 'medicine' that lets you see a different other reality (a horrible overlay...kind of like in 'song of Saya'). As such, the levels play out in a Zelda-like combination of 2 different worlds that sort of interact with each other. It's really a stroke of genius here: it strongly highlights the setting (the other insane inhabitants are being plagued by strange shadows), it sets the character (which of what Fran sees is reality?) and allows for some decent puzzle aspects (some objects need to be picked up in the 'other' reality).  The quality of puzzles is pretty decent. Most of them make sense, used items don't linger in your inventory and chapters aren't too long, so the frustration levels don't get too high. That isn't to say the game is easy: you will get stuck at times. It's a part of these kind of games, so it's not like you can hold it against it.  But while the first 3-4 hours were absolutely wonderful, I have to say that I was more eager to find out about the story than to solve more puzzles. It has seven chapters (five, of which 2 are split into two), and I kind of feel that the main story drags on a bit too long. This may be just me, though.  Probably also worth mentioning is that there are a handful of mini-games within the game. While they break the otherwise rather monotone gameplay, they feel more like tech demo's than part of the experience (yes, you can make a block puzzle game with cogs in them. Congratulations...but why is it there in the first place?). Again: it's hard to complain about getting more game, but the game is certainly long enough without it.  Still...to get back to my opening: if you are into psychological horror (meaning: horror without jumpscares) and point &amp; click games, you will like this game. It's a bit harder to recommend to someone who is just into one of these genres...you'll have to figure that out for yourself, I guess. For me, however, it's an easy thumbs up. :-)",

            "review_text": "I usually don't bother writing reviews, but Fran Bow delivers one of the stronger experiences you can get out of a game.  Gameplay-wise, it is a well written point and click adventure with puzzles that are reasonably challenging, but not to the point you will get stuck often. The music and audio work well to set up the atmosphere, and the graphics have a peculiar character and beauty. The puzzles, audio and, especially, the visuals, are good, although they don't reach the heights of modern masterpieces, such as Machinarium. However, one should consider that this game was actually made by two people and it does illustrate what indie game developers can do.  These factors alone would make a good game, but Fran Bow stands out in two ways. First, it introduces a unique mechanic which consists of visiting alternate realities or seasons which are crucial to the puzzle solutions: In one chapter Fran can move through time by controlling the seasons, while in another three chapters she can move between what might be called a waking world and a world of shadows, the latter being a dark and haunting place where a dinning table full of candy can be replaced by mutilated bodies.  Second, and most important, Fran Bow's story and atmosphere is like a slightly more coherent Alice in Wonderland, but darker, scarier, twisted, and occasionally more dreamlike and touching, where the limits between reality and hallucination are blurred. It is set in a surprisingly rich world with five realities, peculiar creatures and places, and even a made up alphabet which you can decipher thanks to an in-game book. It easy to get engulfed in the story and share Fran's fears, sorrows, and hopes.  This is an experience you will remember for a lifetime.",

From the beginning, I was rather confused on what was going on, having all of these different realities and such, but once you get further into the game and meet the villagers in Ithersta, you see how the cuteness make so much sense. While this town has all the different seasons and, to me at least, cute characters, it had some evil souls, or kamalas, which probably were not allowed there in the first place due to the terror they can cause.  I believe my favorite character was Mr. Itward, because from the start, I thought he would hurt her somehow, and when you meet him in the woods while going home, he's so kind and friendly. The moment where he took Mr. Midnight, I instantly thought that he was the bad guy I saw him as from the start, but from when he throws her a party till' the ending, he really showed just how much he cared, almost having a fatherly figure to Fran.   The only thing I would love for the game is a 'Scene Selection', so that if you want to replay a certain chapter for different achievements, or to ask more questions, you can just choose it and go off from there. All in all, I recommend this game to anyone who wants a cute and sinister adventure!~",

            "review_text": "Fran Bow is a difficult game to review.   From a standard point-and-click perspective, the game delivers wonderfully. The game manages to avoid the common problem many point-and-clicks face; ridiculous solutions or situations (kind of). Every solution to a problem you encounter throughout the game logically makes sense. The situations you come across are sensible in the way that it’s understandable when you cannot surmount a problem initially and have to find a solution. To try to explain more clearly, I’ll mention something I’ve seen plenty of times before in other games; Something is blocked by spider webs. Logically, you should be able to just move them out of the way with your hands, or even any nearby object that isn’t too large. However, the games would make you find a specific object, such as a brush or stick, to finally be able to pass an obstacle that should have been easily passed. Fran Bow manages to avoid having any of these fallacies. When I mentioned “kind of” earlier, I meant that while it achieves this, the situations are really anything but logical.   You play as a drugged out 10 year old girl with a mental disorder and a devastating experience. With this comes a story that goes further and further from reality. While it leads to a story that is unpredictable and exciting, it also loses cohesion and sense. What further hurts the story is that this lack of cohesion leads to it being very open and confusing. Instead of containing and bringing in the story at points to help the player with understanding what’s going on, it’s allowed to freely roam and becomes convoluted. It’s alright to have a story presented like this, don’t misinterpret me saying that’s a bad form of storytelling. However, there has to be understanding from the player. Maybe not initially, but eventually. There is no understanding. It’s never made clear even what’s going on. Things are abruptly introduced, and then just as abruptly dismissed or never brought up again. As mentioned before, there is absolutely zero cohesion as Fran jumps from one point to another. In the end, nothing is solved or answered, and no loose ends are tied. It was an ambitious way to tell the story, and I believe it fell completely flat. The story was a mess.  Much of the appeal of the game to me was Fran. I greatly enjoyed seeing how she interacted with things, with her thoughts drawing conclusions that would have never have drawn myself. The creators did a fine job in capturing the idea that the girl was not mentally sound. I hope to see more games try to capture the type of character she was. It was because of her that I enjoyed the game.  So, to round everything up, I’ll have to say that I do not recommend it. While the game had many good things (I did not go into the graphics, but the hand-drawn 2D graphics are appealing), the story is essential to a point-and-click game. Bad storytelling that, quite frankly, never really ended is too large of a mark to be ignored. Reading through interpretations of the story, some of them are so vastly different from one another that you’d think it was never meant to follow a specific storyline.  On a minor note, I never got any achievements after the first three despite finishing the game. Not a big deal, but something to look out for.",

On the positives, there is genuine intrigue and mystery (particularly in the first couple of chapters), some interesting spooky characters, great animation and cut scene sequences, some good scares and some fairly decent puzzles in the mix.   On the negatives, that's 9 hours of my life that I'm not getting back.    I don't want to give anything away in this review but there is a serious point where they drop the ball on both the story line and my interest. I really had to drag myself through chapter three to five.  It starts out very true to the Steam adverts/clips with the very creepy asylum and the strong beginnings of a mystery, where you're ultimately trying to work out if she is traumatised and innocent or psychotic and guilty.   It then swiftly evolves into something that reminded me very much of when a child is trying to describe their dream from the night before ('and then this happened, and this strange character was there....').  There were some genuinely good escape room puzzles in this, but then there was a whole chapter of irratingly (and needlessly) long winded chapters. On a whole it felt like they were trying to mix several short escape games into one, with each chapter feeling more rushed and thrown together than the last. I enjoyed the mini games that broke up the chapters although I thought they were not in keeping with the main game itself.    I would not reccommend this game, unless you were interested in playing the first two chapters only.",

            "review_text": "I can't say I didn't enjoy Fran Bow, but as a story based game it leaves a bad taste in my mouth with writing decisions which leave too much room for speculations.  What I enjoyed: It's set in a very well designed world with lots of loveable and relatable characters. It's kind of weird though how the game plays out. It's supposedly a horror game, but it's barely functioning as one. The game incorporates a lot of peaceful and likeable characters and enviroments, which is very rare, but it's not a concept which can't work, and here it kind of does. With this it's easy to make a huge contrast so it's shocking elements have a bigger effect. Using this, the game switches between dark and happy themes a few times to make a world which may as well be Fran's disturbed mind, and it's presented with a gorgeous art style. Also, for the most part the writing is good, but unfortunately when it matters the most they failed to make something interesting.  It's hard to talk about what I don't like about this game without spoiling anything. So for those of you who don't want it to get spoiled, the game's story is written in a way that when you get answers it only raises more questions. And in the end you get so much ♥♥♥♥ thrown at you (trying to explain what exactly happened) that it's not only overwhelming, but feels like a very heedless way to fininsh a game. Everything which happens in the last like 10 minutes is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and I don't mean it in a way that it's completely unlikeable, there were moments which were great and memorable, but outside of that it's really just a rushed way to try and tighten up loose ends, but it just couldn't do that with all of them.  So yeah, it's hard to explain what I didn't like, but all in all it was a pleasant experience.",

There are good and bad creatures, strange places, etc. So the story is basically a slightly darker version of Alice in Wonderland.   Positive: -The characters are nice. The graphics are nice. The mini games are nice. The puzzles are OK, although they can be sometimes too frustrating or too obvious.  Negative: -I can't give a good rating to this game mainly because of the extremely long and dull dialogues. There are a lot of characters that you come accross and you have to talk to almost all of them. Most of these conversations are meaningless and helpless. They talk nonsense and they contribute very less to the story because the story is not clear at the end. Believe me, they are VERY long, and VERY boring. Creatures, demons, magic, terrible dreams and a lot of 'I miss my home and my cat' cryings. You have two choices in converstaions and they have no effect at all. You always have to click LMB to go on with the conversation. For god's sake, at least give me a keyboard button or something.   - The gameplay lacks logic sometimes, which can be really frustrating. At one part of the puzzle, you try to combine two objects but it doesn't let you do it. Then you pass that stage, you do a few other things, then you have to combine those two objects this time to continue. But since you think they can't be combined, you don't bother trying the same thing again, which is the normal human behaviour. So you get stuck there just for nothing.

If you haven't played the game you should do so. But don't panic about finding time, because time is an infinitely layered reality. :]",

This is one of those gems, and it soon became my favourite.  The protaganist, Fran, invites you to love her instantly as she struggles to deal with the world around her. You find yourself joining her on the emotional rollercoaster as you advance the confused, frightened little girl through her story, on the quest to find Mr. Midnight and solve the inumerable questions that Fran faces.  In this point and click game, parts of it are quite difficult. The game requires you to be incredibly observant so I suggest regular rest breaks so you stay focused. When you are fully immersed in the game, some parts of it can make you jump. I found myself never quite expecting what I found, even though I knew it was coming.  The themes in the game are brilliant. On the surface this is a game about a mentally ill little girl. If you dig deeper there are darker themes afoot, such as child abuse, authority figures abuse of power, and a spectrum of insanity.  I don't think there's any way of doing this game justice. The beauty of it, from the artwork to the story to the development of the characters. You will find hours of fun in this game and I can't wait to play it through again. Highly recommended.",

Well then let´s get started  Short Review: Fran bow is a masterpiece that deserves to be loved. It has quite some similarities with the fandoms listed above. What it is, is simply a horror point and click adventure. Howeve it has quite some unique tricks up it´s sleeve. I don´t want to spoil too much about the story, since it´s best enjoyed blind, but let me say this: You play a girl names Fran Bow Dagenhart who met a terrible fate and suffered several mental disorders, beeing held in Oswald Asylum. You have to help her find her best friend. The story is great, the characters are unique and the game is just a serious nightmare fueled drug trip. Go for it.   In-depth Review: I hope you have read my short review, because Im not going to write the same things twice, otherwise this review would be wayyy to long. People with a weak stomache beware, because there is a lot of blood, gore and other things that might disturb you and your sleep. The first half of the game just gives you the shivers and opens so many questions. The characters you meat in the first half of the game are… let´s say weird, in a good, but really creepy way. The first half of the game is propably by far the creepiest and will get you far more often than you would like to. It will turn your guts and make you ask yourself what the f* is happening. Frankly speaking it´s an amazing experience. After the first half of the game, the experience changes quite drasticly as you fall deeper and deeper into a fantasy world alice-in-wonderland-style. I was a bit dissappointed, that the amazing creepy feeling of the first half was replaced that way, however the game still tries to remind you about what all this is really about. So the horror element isn´t entirely gone, but rather towned down a bit. Don´t let that fool you though. It starts to feel like you are alice and wander trough wonderland, starting to make you question what is real and what isn´t. The border between reality and fantasy gets blurry and there is an insane amount of space to interpret and think about the meaning of all this, as well as their connection to the fran-bow-universe and ours. In short: it makes you question whether what you truly see is real. It connects so many points and just forms a well rounded and compeling lore about the whole setting and the characters. Obviously the game took quite some inspiration from other famous works, like alice in wonderland (which is even sometimes indirectly referenced to in the game). Me as a real fan of surrealism am completly amazed by this game. I Highly recommend it.",

I don't expect voice acting for such a game from an indie developer, but some 'talking' sound effects would be nice to give more flavor to the characters.

The game holds a very creepy dreamlike atmosphere and doesn't use the basic jump scare tatic to keep it unsettling. I will say certain parts of the game are a little cliche, i.e: insane asylum,creepy little girl, shadow monsters. But it also introduces very interesting 'creatures', and game mechanics that help separate it from others. The pill mechanic being one of the more prominent mechanics, allows the player to see the game in two different perspectives. The game is also very linear, when given a choice in a conversation it will usually give you the same 'ending' without much diversity, with the exception of a couple. But I don't feel that really detracted me when playing the game. The campaign takes about 5-7 hours long to complete and it took me about 10 to get 100% complete. That being said I recommend getting the game while it's on sale as they are asking $15 bucks for the game.

However; I do recommend that you read my Pros and Cons and judge by yourself if the Cons don't bother you and the Pros are worth your money. This is MY point of view over the game. I'm sorry if you don't agree with me on some points.  Pros: Breathtaking storyline. You absolutely don't see any of it coming. Everything is greatly attached together in the story, it makes it truly amazing. Choices. I love that you do include choices, even though those seem to have no matter over the final course of the game. The simple act of having a choice on the dialogues makes you feel included in the story. Very clever. Lovely artwork. From the very Fran Bow to the trees, the artwork in this game is something worth noticing.  Cons: No voiceover? Bad decision. This game is half wandering around, half chatting with the characters on the game. That being said, being such an important thing in the game, it's disappointing to see that there were no voices added in the game. I do like the tiny detail of hearing the characters talk for themselves instead of just reading a dialogue. It's like reading an old book. It gets boring. As said above, half the game is wandering around. That's another strong bulletpoint. It gets tiring after a long while since it gives you no clues whatsoever, so you go wandering around and eventually give up and realise that you need to search for a walkthrough because you're lost. Puzzles too difficult. The puzzles turn your head upside down and you start paying less attention to the actual storyline itself, or even the game as a whole, because the puzzles get impossible. There's no skipping button. No hint button. It drives me crazy! I spent roughly half an hour on each puzzle, and I may be halfway through the game with luck!  As you probably figured by now, I focus more on a strong storyline in these types of games.",

I found myself putting AAA titles on ice to finish this beautiful game.   Characters you meet along the way are interesting and each unique, I actually WANTED to talk to everybody/evervegetable to find out where the conversation would lead...   It's bizarre, I felt creeped out at times, found myself laughing out loud sometimes and immensely enjoyed even the simplest things like Fran's comments while clicking on the head of a dismembered deer.  Puzzles are relatively easy to figure out without being overly easy and I never found myself frustratingly stuck. Everything could be solved by thinking things through for a bit. Also no randomly combining things to make another thing that makes zero sense to get the thing stuck in the tree - which normally kills all the fun in adventures games.  Having played many, many adventure games in my life... this is without a doubt one of my favourites and deserves to be experienced, BUY IT, the overwhelmingly positive reviews are spot on!  Besides, IT'S FALKOR!",

Adventure games are not my favorite usually; I tend to give up on them if they are too long or the story doesn\\'t hold my interest (or there too random/hard, etc). Finished this in just under 9 hours, most of the puzzles either make sense or there are nudges in the right direction if you pay attention and don\\'t rush.   I got this one due to to the art style in the screen shots (reminded me of Spirited Away, one of my favorite movies) and great positive reviews and I am very glad I did. If it\\'s not obvious by the screenshots above, this game is very mature (gore, themes, etc...not for kids; very unlike Sprited Away). This is another example of an indie gem.

The game is especially creepy and disturbing during the first two chapters. The story does go off the rails into the nonsensical a bit beginning with the third chapter, but in the end I was pleased with the narrative, which I think is open to more than one interpretation. The cast of characters is great as well. If you're at all a fan of the genre, I would definitely recommend spending some time with this point-and-click horror adventure!",

The game has many strong points, including the art style and the horror elements. The puzzles will also keep you busy for a while, but they are not so hard that you will sit there for several hours trying to find one 'piece' of one. I would keep a walkthrough handy though, because they can be hard to figure out.   My main complaint is that the story begins to lose composure near the end, and ultimately doesn't make any damn sense when we finally get to the end. I mean, I'm not against ambigiuous endings, but I usually like some sort of clue as to what MIGHT have happened, or some sort of implication, not just some random ♥♥♥♥. Maybe it may just be because I'm not the 'arty' type, but I found the ending somewhat disappointing and underwelming and took quite a bit away from the game.   6/10",
