The main reason I like it though is that it has 100 levels that start out pretty easy. I've tried other games that had a few levels and I just got murdered every game. I would make some mistake and that would be it. Here I can slowly work up and improve, and it's a lot more enjoyable. Haven't tried the online or anything, but the computer AI at least starts out at a level where I can improve without getting wiped out little by little.",

The dev team have been quick to fix bugs, and have kept in constant contact with the community. The game is plain, and could do with some improving. But it is clear that they listen, and for any issues, just approach the devs through the discussions.  On a side note, anyone complaining that this game is free, and saying that is a bad thing? You are absolute morons. It is free, and to try to use that as a negative purely on the basis of it's being free is inherently anti-consumer. You can literally test out if this game is for you, without paying a penny up front. Buy premium if you want to feel like you've bought this game. otherwise, just enjoy that it's free.  Of everything on steam, a decent, free chess game with a responsive developer is a breath of fresh air, compared to all the pay-for Slaughtering Grounds and Temper Tantrums that just want your money and don't care about quality.  Of course, this isn't the best chess game out there. but with the dev team pushing through the bugs, and their quick response time to critique, I've no doubt in my mind that this game will get better.",

Alot of variation and is very good.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Playing against bots is as great as playing against another human player!

If you choose to play against the computer; you get the option to adjust its difficulty setting from 1 to 100, the higher the number, the smarter the A.I. I haven't played against the computer yet; because I prefer to play against other people, (despite the fact that I'm not very good at Chess.)  It is very easy to find someone online, the longest I have ever had to wait to play against someone online would probably only be about one minute.   Although I prefer to get out a real board and play off that; I would still recommend anyone who is interested to at least try it (especially since it doesn't cost any money.)",

You can set a turn time limit (idk what the options are cause I only use the largest, but they are ridiculously generous with 30 days being the max).  I'm playing on linux, and it's stable, in my experince so far there are no bugs, and it has several themes to suit your needs. You can go 2D or 3D, with themes for the pieces/board as well as the desk thing the set is on.  There's really not much else to say, I mean if you like chess, it's...Simply Chess.",

(Fixed) -There is a bit of jitteriness with 3D but that might be the fault of my crap PC -The GUI for games doesn't seem very appealing but it's ok (Fixed) -Even though everything is recognisable, the art style is just lacking that simplistic and crispy look that I've come to enjoy in Chess games. -Barely any different styles. -Ads that you have to pay to get rid of -no drag and drop (Fixed) -no timer so people can go AFK if they know they've lost and thus forcing you to concede from impatience  At the end of the day, it's free chess, it's fine (though a bit lackluster)   oh yeah, and controller support...for some reason",

It doesn't seem to grasp the concept that the king can defend itself in a limited fashion. It thinks it has me beat by putting it's queen next to my king. King takes queen.  It's also very protective of it's pieces. For example if there's ever a situation where it could take my rook by sacrificing a bishop it will never take my rook, even if it would put it in a better position strategically speaking. This basically allows me to control the board by purposefully putting my pieces in dangerous sitations forcing it to back off. It probably doesn't act this way at higher levels.  Other than that, it's chess and it's free. There's probably a million others out there just like it but this is the first that's made it to Steam.",

As in, more serious one, not the dot and cross thing. Merida, Pirouetti, etc. Your chat button is almost out of the screen in fullscreen. I don't think your chat works. I understand that the rules of chess have the 'Once you lift a piece you have to move it' rule but computer versions of this usually do not have such a rule as you never know when your mouse will start to glitch and suddenly click on a piece.  In terms of style: The font is too overdone. It may be just me but, the steel look around my profile is not nice (maybe something simpler or nothing at all) In my opinion, a modern look of chess would be great, no need to remind us about how old this game is. Make it seem like its something new. I don't think you need shortcuts for each menu.   I would say that online versions would be better.",
