            "review_text": "  A fun game with nice graphics and simple gameplay style.   The controls are quite easy: use a mouse to fly straigt and rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. This requires some time to master but once you learn it its quite easy. One problem I found is that it doesnt work with touchscreen loptops like lenovo yoga or dell inspiron 2 in 1 loptops because they only simulate right click on touch and this game requires to use both left and right mouse buttons repeatedly.   Since this is game is ported from mobile platform to PC the gameplay has some roots in flappy bird as well as other popular mobile games.   Visuals in the game are really good.  Overall 8/10.",
