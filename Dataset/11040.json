Love the ability to play as Holmes, Watson, or Lestrade. (however, the game decides when you play each character) I really like the music choice, fitting for the game and quite pretty! Has the ability to switch between first person or third person. I find the first person perspective best. Holmes rules! :D",

            "review_text": "Nemesis is a great addition to the Sherlock Holmes series. The story of Holmes rising to the challenge of a criminal adversary is familiar to any fan, and this time it's the gentleman thief character Arsene Lupin. Lupin is a truly interesting character, which makes solving his thefts a fun task. The story does have its weak spots near the end (   The ridiculous thing with Queen Victoria, not to mention what happens when you actually catch him...  ) but they aren't enough to take away from the game's overall value. Personally, I think Nemesis is the best game of the series so far.  Graphics and gameplay wise, Nemesis is nearly identical to Awakened. The hint system is much better though, which is helpful since the puzzles in Nemesis tend to be more math related. Though math puzzles may sound daunting, the puzzles are actually quite fun this time around, and the option to use hints eliminates any ragequit frustration. There is quite a bit of backtracking in the museum section, but you can use the fast travel system to get between areas quickly.  Also, Creepy Watson has been fixed, (un)fortunately.",

            "review_text": "Upon first installing this game I was disappointed it wouldn't run at all, or even stream from my newer PC. :( But luckily, after a little searching here on the Steam Discussions, I figured out to install the latest two PhysX Nvidia drivers and now all is well. Yay!  I would recommend to anyone new to this franchise: play the demo first to decide if you like this type of game.  I only payed $2.49, so my wife and I are quite satisfied. We've played other Frogware games like this one so are familiar and happy with it. It's too bad there doesn't seem to be any controller support for it, but it's still a fun and playable game.",
