I played the first few chapters and was so stressed out I ended up taking a break for over a year! I finally finished the game a few months before Dead Space 2 came out. It still stands out as THE most stressful, scary, and panic inducing games I have ever played.  Even though it's 'old' it has aged well and even through all the blood and gore, it's still beautiful. Dig into the story and you'll enjoy this even more. Dead Space is the only game series that I've geeked out hard enough to read books about, it's that good. I hold the DS series at the top of my list of best games, right along with the Half-Life, Portal, and Mass Effect games.",

One might say I have an obsession with the series and I can say with certainty that this game is worth buying, especially during a sale  Positives: - A compelling story which begins the epic franchise that has spanned 5 games (including Extraction and Dead Space IOS), 2 movies, 2 novels and 2 graphic novels - Fully immersive game mechanics. No HUDs, no pause while looking through inventory, all character data is displayed on Isaac Clarke's RIG in real-time, all 'cut scenes' happen in real time - Diverse weapons each with a primary and secondary fire mode, plus two tools to help in combat; Kinesis, which allows you to pick up and hurl objects; and Stasis, which slows enemies and dangerous objects - A terrifying and grotesque foe who are as varied as they are aggressive, who are capable of tactical adaption - Zero Gravity environments that change the dynamics of gameplay and how you fight - Rich and detailed environments with atmospheric ambient noises and music - New Game + which allows you to carry on your fight with all your previous gear and upgrades - The option to run game higher than 30fps on PC - please see below for issues however  Negatives: - The port is not without faults. You are either locked to 30fps or, by disabling Vsync, unlimited fps but with physics issues - Poor M/KB compatibility and what appears to be command delay for controllers - Linear gameplay that begins to stagnate after one or two playthroughs - New Game + does not allow you to change difficulty level - DLC available on console absent from Steam. While not necessary I dislike content exclusivity  Solutions: - Both of the first two negatives can be fixed, please consult the Steam Forum for solutions  Conclusion: An absolute must for fans of great third person action games but especially for fans of Horror. Horror is a niche market in video games these days with fewer and fewer contributions to its genre. This might be from a previous generation of games but it still stands tall with the best of them in my opinion",

            "review_text": "Overall score = 8/10  Dead Space is a wonderful game combining many genres, third person shooter, survival, action, and horror, all into on. While some games fail when trying to do too much, Dead Space is able to do all of these parts well and deliver a satisfying experience from start to finish.  Dead Space progresses very nicely from start to finish. The story is intriguing and, while horrifying space creatures is nothing new, presents a well rounded and detail/lore filled experience that took some thought to follow. The opening sequence leads very nicely right into the action, immediately making you want to find out just what happened to that ship.   As far as firefights go, this game offers some intense sequences. Whenever I overcame a hoard of enemies I felt like a badass, but I always hoped that an engagement like that wouldn't happen again. This may be what Dead Space does best: present you in an environment that makes you uncomfortable, leave you feeling exposed at all times, and give you just enough to get the job done if you do it right and think on your feet.   That being said, I found the biggest flaws in the game to also center around the combat situations. While there are plenty of action sequences in the game, it is not as smooth as other action games, which is of course fine as this isn't the initial purpose. However, some sequences and enemies felt cheap to me when you meet them. The enemies are varied, challenging, and interesting as a whole, but some sequences are downright frustrating. Often this happens when an objective is not fully clear or your purpose is not adequately explained. I don't expect a game to hold my hand, but when it isn't clear what that button you just pressed does, but swarms of enemies come out of the vents, it can become exhasperating. Fortunately, this doesn't happen too often.  The progression system in Dead Space is very good and rewarding. You can build your loadout to your playstyle and upgrade equipment to suit your strengths. Dead Space offers a variety of weapons to use and tactics to implement to keep battles fresh and fun.  I would definitely recommend Dead Space, even though it is a few years old. It is still a great game, and at a discount during Christmas or summer for $5 simply can't be missed.",

            "review_text": "***I originally wrote this review on 11-04-2008***  Creating a successful horror game is tricky. There needs to be just enough of a blend tension, fear and scare tactics so the game does not fall to mundane generic enemies jumping out at players. Dead Space not only creates the one of the best atmospheres in a horror video game, it’s full of enough puzzles, frights and dilemmas to make even the most jaded 3rd Person Shooter player sit up and take notice.   You play as Isaac Clarke, a space engineer, traveling to the USG Ishimura, a “Planet Cracker” which is emitting a distress call. After a tense opening sequence, Isaac boards the ship with his coworkers, Lt. Zach Hammond, security officer, and Kendra Daniels, a computer expert, and soon realizes this is no ordinary distress call as the ship has been overrun by an alien race. Isaac gets separated from his coworkers and must fight his way through the alien monsters to bring the ship back online and find a way off the Ishimura.    Gameplay:    Dead Space has taken every great piece of third person gameplay in the history of video games and combines it together to deliver an entertaining, enjoyable journey. You navigate Isaac from an over-the-shoulder view. There is no Heads Up Display (HUD) in Dead Space. Your health is indicated by the light meter embedded in the spine of your suit spine. Your ammo is displayed above your weapon when you aim and your stasis meter is also located on the back of your suit. What is stasis? It is a piece of technology that gives you the ability to slow down objects and enemies for puzzle solving and reaction time. You can recharge your stasis by accessing stations located throughout the ship or by finding portable stasis packs. Isaac also has the ability to use Kinesis, which allows him to move heavy objects or acquire objects that are out of reach. Stasis becomes available to Isaac a few minutes into the game, and Kinesis becomes available for use when entering the second chapter and has unlimited use.  The game's most unique and striking appeal is operating in zero gravity or a vacuum. When entering a Zero-G zone, Isaac has the ability to jump from one side of the area to another. This opens up an new realm of puzzle solving and is some of the most fun sequences in the game.   The enemies in Dead Space are deformed humans that were killed and turned into monsters by a race of alien creatures. There are a dozen or so different styles of enemies that navigate their way through the ships ventilation system, which means you may encounter an enemy at any given time. As many enemies as there are, they all can be taken out with the same technique: begin by shooting off their limbs first. Direct hits to the body will waste ammo, especially during fights with the tougher, more advanced enemies. Some of the more memorable enemies are the epic boss fights that also combine a little Zero-G action. The threats on the ship are sometimes not always enemy related. Dead Space shifts gears twice for a little Han Solo, “Don’t Get Cocky” turret action.   So how do you take out all the enemies? With a wide range of weaponry of course. Isaac begins the game with a Cutter, an extremely accurate “laser” that fires a wide beam either horizontally or vertically. There are tons of lockers and chests to explore during the course of the game. Some lockers may contain ammo and others may contain credits, which can be used in Stores. At these Store locations, Isaac can store, ammo and items. Isaac is limited in the number of items he can carry, however the number of items can be increased if he upgrades his suit. Usually near by a store, is a Workbench, where Isaac can upgrade his weapons and gear.  There is a lot of backtracking in Dead Space. At the beginning of each chapter, Issac exits a tram which carries passengers from one section of the ship to another, and at the end of each chapter he makes his way back to the same tram to journey to the next section of the ship. Isaac visits some sections of the ship more than once. There are tons of save points throughout Dead Space, probably more than there should be. Even if you don not save, Dead Space autosaves so much that you really do not have to save once through the entire game, unless you want to exit out of Dead Space or turn off your PS3. To make the game even easier, the developers also added in a feature that actually maps out the direction Isaac needs to travel to complete his next objective. This feature is displayed by a blue outline on the ground. (see pic below)  The problem that most avid gamers will notice is that everything, aside from the zero gravity gameplay, has been borrowed from past films, novels, or other games. The over the shoulder view bares a striking resemblance to Resident Evil 4, the monsters are mere replicas of John Carpenter's The Thing, parallels in Event Horizon are seen throughout the entire game including some obvious set design rip offs and features in Doom 3 and System Shock are also used in Dead Space. It is at this point where we stop and think: are these references by the EA Readwood Game designers an homage to their favs or are they simply thefts? No matter, the similarities are not enough to take away from the Dead Space experience which delivers a terrifying story, but the influences are definitely obvious.    Graphics and Sound:   Dead Space does everything right graphically. It looks beautiful in full 1080p when staring out into the vast ocean of space, blowing an enemies head off, or playing through some beautiful level designs of what a 'Planet Cracker's' engine room, maintenance bay and mining section may look like.   The sound effects are also top notch in Dead Space. As Isaac communicates with his team, a 2D holograph image appears before Isaac, which the player can rotate. The static overlaid onto the video and audio logs is incorporated nicely, and the creeks and cracks heard throughout the broken ship add much to the atmosphere. Listen for the lullaby.   Players may pick up quickly on how Visceral tries to scare its players. They use the same formula that Hollywood does, during a tense or critical moment in the game they play loud music like the typical brass pieces you hear in most horror movies. More often than not this takes place when a player looks in the direction of an enemy. So this tactic may help a player in certain areas rather than scare him or her. If a player is not paying attention and some random horns start playing, that is a pretty good indication that there was probably a monster that ran past the door that they probably missed.    Pros : controls work extremely well on the PS3, terrifying boss battles, graphics and sound are gripping,    Cons : : unoriginal enemies, predictable but engaging story, very easy to beat, lots of backtracking    Bottom Line : I recommend this game in spite of my criticism of the unoriginality of some of its elements but it is defendable to question why this game has been so highly touted. Some have labeled Dead Space as the ‘Worlds Scariest Game’ and people are shouting from roof tops to “Buy this game immediately!”. The game isn’t perfect, but what is? It has a wonderfully smooth flowing story, a great environment, near perfect controls and graphics that can make a grown man cry. Dead Space is solid game that should be experienced by as many players as possible. There are striking resemblances to a dozen pieces of work, but they are forgivable. Expect a sequel.",

Play this game with headphones and you will appreciate Viscerals attention to sound details. Metal clashing, electricity buzzing, necromorphs (The monsters) moving around in vents, Issac's breathing, screams - all out horror noises.   The graphics are good. Most of the game is quite dim to create the horror element. LIghts and sparks of electricity add to an array of lighting effects.  You have a great choice of weapons which can be upgraded in-game by collecting powernodes. I love how you have in-game currency and literally do not have to spend real life money at all.  PLAY IT before Dead Sppace 2 &amp; 3 - otherwise the story won't make much sense, plus it's by far the best in the trilology.  Dead Space - ruining my life since 2008",

The story itself revolves around a planetcracker mining vessel known as the USG Ishimura, that sends out a distress signal from the planet Aegis VII. You play as the engineer, Isaac Clarke, who is dispatched with a small crew to investigate the aforementioned distress signal.

            "review_text": "I have had some mixed feelings about this game, but then again this happens for a lot of horror games I've played. I'm not a big fan of jumpscares as I feel them being a cheap way to enthrill. Then again I've played this game through 3 times and the reason for that is that this game has a very good gameplay. It has some mediocre issues in storytelling and atmosphere that prevents this being an outstanding game. Instead, this is just good.  I have played all parts of the series, except third installement is still uncompleted. Then again the third one didn't seem to have anything to do with the first one so I though I might as well review this now.  The plot of the game is pretty generic. In space no one can hear you scream. Weird monsters invade space ship and the protagonist must fight back after their immediate escape possibilities are cut down. Plot starts immediately and isn't very surprising at any point. Player travels back and forth in the ship doing stuff while other characters in the game stand still and cry. Kendra Daniels is one of the most annoying side characters I've so far seen or heard in a game.  The part where this game excels is that it makes the playing part fun, although the plot is uninsteresting. By giving the possibility to cut limbs instead of just shooting aliens, this game makes the fights somewhat more interesting and more pleasing. In a fight with multiple enemies, one can shoot their legs off before move to finishing them with another weapon. Also by making playable character a walker instead of a runner, the game is much better paced than some other horror games. Sure he can run, but he cannot shoot while running and running usually ends in a situation where a necromorph is close enough to hug Isaac.  Then again even though the pacing excels, this is yet another example where I think the game could've used a real director(like movies have). Though the game tries to be a horror game, it rarely excels in it. Most of the enemies are given away by loud roars or sudden violin sounds. Basically player just turns to where ever the sound came and shoots. Some jump scares are not enough to call it a horror game. It's a jump-scare-game. I'm not afraid of jumpscare, I just don't like them, like sewage. The game loses a lot of atmosphere by doing this. Games scaries part are the vacuum scenarios where no sound is played, so one must stay alert all the time for the enemy. Also there are occasionally so many enemies that I felt like playing a shooter instead of atmospheric horro game.  The game is really cheap today(2,5eur in sales) so no hurt trying. Easiest difficulty setting is enough to take any challenge out of the game if one feels like going it just for the story, although some atmosphere is lost by doing this.  To anyone suffering mouse problems, try V-sync out and force v-sync from video driver software or utilities like radeonpro. Also playable without v-sync but some say they've had problems related to one door not opening. Also playing without any kind of vsync might cause coil whine in gpu with FPS running over 200 with better cards(2012 enthusiast -&gt;)  I recommend this game as a nice way to pass 8-10 hours, but don't expect anything great out of it. It's solid and it's good enough to give it a try. If you don't like it, don't buy the next installements either, they give nothing more.",

Loud surround sound + vibrating gamepad + Ripper saw = glee! and gore. Concerned neighbours, maybe.  Mandatory protip: Do NOT have Vsync on, it is bugged and will screw up your controls, making you think it's a sloppy console job. Other than that I've not found any technical flaws. Supposedly main menu's 'continue game' can reset your difficulty to Normal, use 'load game' instead.  Protip #2: DO NOT PLAY ON ANYTHING LESS THAN HARD DIFFICULTY. You'll thank yourself later. Easy/Normal is like playing with god mode. (Impossible difficulty is extra fun but it needs unlocking)  The sequel has huge stompin' boots to fill.",

The best way to kill any of these monsters is by dismembering them one limb (or two) at a time using your Plasma Cutter and other futuristic power tools! Lots of fun, good jump scares, and a serviceable plot all tie together into a really good time. Just be sure to turn Vsync on... or off.. I forget which, if your mouse controls are lagging. Just swap it to whatever it isn't set on already.  If you're considering buying the double pack with Dead Space 2, do it!

The game doesn't really go for good scares, mostly just sudden 'oh my god it's an alien coming straight for you suddenly have a loud noise' and they just got incredibly predictable after a while. But it can be quite creepy at times - probably helped absolutely humonguous amounts by the absolutely incredible sound design of this game. I think that this might the only time I max out one of the score categories for a game.  Seriously, the sound design is just amazing. Incredible ambient noise, with really creepy nuances and fantastic utterly disgusting music for when you get under attack. Every single sound made is absolutely perfect.  Also the UI of this game is just amazing. Everything makes sense in the game world, it's all projected out of your suit or from screens on everything. It's fantastic, and it helps increase the tension because you can't pause the game by opening the map screen/inventory screen.  The gameplay is pretty good, though I didn't feel it got tough enough on Normal difficulty so perhaps Hard difficulty is the right difficulty to play it on. The weapons are all satisfying to use, and can be very effective when upgraded correctly. I liked the way most of the enemies had weak points you could exploit to kill them quicker and conserve more ammo. The design of the aliens was fantastic, and the ship design was quite good (I liked how you had to revisit some levels for good reason, and some things had changed and that actually made it slightly creepy and foreboding).  The story wasn't particularly impressive, but a few bits of it were quite good. I was quite disappointed by the very end of the game though, like literally the last few seconds [if you've played it you'll know what I mean] because it just felt incredibly cheap.  Other than that, this game was very good. A definite play, if not for the perfectly adequate gameplay then just for the mindblowingly incredible sound. Seriously, someone give the guy who did all that all the awards. Ever. All the awards.",

Although it relies a lot on jump-scares, the overarching, pervasive feeling of danger is effectively evoked and present throughout the entire game; unlike most horror films and games, it does not rely on the player/character to make stupid decisions to perpetuate its air of chilling anticipation. The combat actually requires a decent amount of skill, and if you're playing on a harder difficulty, the game *does* live up to the 'survival' part of the genre. The enemies are interestingly not the lone source of the scare either; the environment and its hazards play just as big a role in it.  All in all, I can easily say that Dead Space is my favorite game of all time. It does such justice to the survival-horror genre that I believe it should set an example for what other titles in it should aim for.",

Hard genuinely feels like a survival horror game. The monsters feel like a real threat because they are challenging and you have to conserve your ammo which creates alot of tension during the fights. I don't think the game is scary at all however. The atmosphere and setting is great but the scares themselves i didn't find effective at all. I can think of two reasons why the scares don't work, guns and third person. When an enemy jumps out you have a way of defending yourself by shooting them so that vulnerability factor is lessened because of that. This is why games like amnesia and outlast work so well at being scary because you have no way of defending yourself. Even a game like Fear works so well, even though its a first person shooter the scares are supernatural and unkillable which is what makes it so effective. Because the game is in third person the monsters don't jump out in your face like they would in first person. The scares are at a distance from you because you are positioned behind the character you are playing. I don't think the game needs to be scary to work though it's still a great game because of its amazing atmosphere and sound effects and the game is just fun to play.  8/10 (Great)",

Ammo being scarcer would have helped build the tension as even on the hard setting you're basically Scrooge McAmmo-Man.   To combat the spacebeasts you're provided with a myriad of weapons, of which you can carry up to 4 at any given time. You can switch them out at HUBs though I only found 3 of them satisfying to use. Along with the weapons you get a couple of cool abilities which work well in harmony. Despite the pointless CQC, I found targeting limbs and blowing stuff up very fun. You also get some cool looping level design which works well in this environment and an interesting story.   From a technical side it isn't the most proficient game out there. Cadavers tend to randomly bug out and just writhe around uncontrollably which will likely scare you more than the scripted scares.

My one complaint of the entire deadspace series (well, 3 has a few, but this isnt the place for that :P) is that a few of the controls are hardbound and cannot be remapped. That forced me to use a controller for the duration of the series, except during very brief sections of the game when you take control of a very large gun and it was simply too dificult for me to complete with the controller.

Unfortunately for Isaac and his crew, shortly after they arrive on board the crippled vessel, all hell breaks loose. Their craft is destroyed, leaving them stranded on the Ishimura. The crew is attacked by nightmarish creatures known as Necromorphs, who kill most of Isaac's team and separate him from the surviving members. Even worse, the ship and its systems have started to be corrupted or are failing thanks to the Necromorphic infestation. It's up to Isaac to wander the halls, search for any friends or survivors that are still alive, and fix as many problems as he can until he can find a way to escape the ship, which can take you 12 or more hours to complete.   - Jeff Haynes  (ign.com)  -",

If you are looking for a violent, gory, horror type of gameplay, Dead Space knocks it out of the park. If you are looking for something that will keep you up at night jumping at your own shadow, then you better should look elsewhere for games such as Outlast or Alient Isolation.   Dead Space takes you through several different types of environments which keeps most of the experiences fresh. Unfortunately, you will end up revisiting several areas and looking at the interior of a ship does become bland after several hours. That being said, the graphics are fantastic considering how old this game is.   Much of the weaponry is very fun to use. Not all of the weapons is simply a point and click (although most are). Using secondary fire options and the nature of the guns takes a bit of getting used to but can have very satisfying, gory results. You will likely find your favorite 2, maybe 3, weapons and you will use and upgrade those throughout the game. As a result, weapon variety leaves a bit to be desired.   The difficulty was decent, but I haven't tried the insane mode just yet. You will likely die a couple times through a particular playthrough if you are an experienced gamer with third person shooters.   Overall, this game was fantastic. There are some areas for improvement (hopefully they were fixed in Dead Space 2) but will definitely entertain you for many hours and has a lot of room for replayability. Definitely a game worth picking up, especially if it is on sale.",

            "review_text": "Excellent action-horror game.  In the search for my 'horror' cravings I came upon Dead Space, a third person horror game created by EA. Boy was I satisfied...  The story starts off with you (Issac Clark) an engineer that is part of a crew sent to respond to a distress beacon sent by a ship that was long thought to have been missing. One of the missing survivors from the ship is your girlfriend. Things aren't as they seem on the ship, as you get attacked by alien life forms called 'necromorphs' and have to work with the survivors to escape the ship. The story is good and has a few twists.  The sound is great. You can hear the clanging of metal, sounds of engines and necromorph movement which adds to the tense atmosphere. The voice acting is good as well from the suporting characters who are great at setting the scene.  Gameplay involves third-person combat. You get a variety of weapons which you can buy or find as you play. Weapons include the plasma cutter, shotgun, pulse rifle etc. You can upgrade weapons by finding upgrade nodes. The upgrade nodes are rare so you need to use them cautiously, preferably only fully upgrading one or two weapons. You can also upgrade your armor to increase health, carry more weapons as well as improve oxygen levels for space exploration. The game is seperated into chapters, with each chapter taking part in a different area of the ship. You move slowly (similar to Resident evil 4), but you can also sprint for a duration. Also there is no hud in the game, instead you have a healthbar which is shown at the back of your suit. Finally, opening your inventory doesn't pause the game, so you can still be attacked. Aside from combat you may have to do some puzzles where you have to move items around.  Your enemies are necromorphs. These horryfying monsters need to be de-limbed in order to take them down quickly. They move exceptionally fast and some have range attacks as well. One of my favourite moments was being surrounded by necromorphs and pumping dozens of pulse rifle rounds into them, it literally felt like I was one of the marines in 'Aliens'.   The graphics hold exceptionally well for today's standards. The lighting is dark and gritty, which helps to make the player feel tensed up as they traverse the ship.  One of the problems I have with this game are the mouse controls. I suffer major mouse lag when turning my character around and aiming my guns, even after maxing out mouse sensitivity. This makes it difficult to aim for limbs on the enmey hence, making combat unecessarily complicated and difficult.   I highly recommend this game to fans of action-horror games.",

The gunplay is great, the weapon variety is plenty, and the types of enemies are varied. The dismembering aspect of the game is unique and well executed. Headshots do damage sure, but cut off their ♥♥♥♥ing limbs. Probably the highest point of the game is the music and overall atmosphere. Traditional music cues often mislead one into feeling safe, only to realize that they aren't in the slightest. Add tight corridors, dim lighting, and hearing monsters in the vents and you've got yourself a night of spooks. Highly recommended.  * First is a certain Mini-game you're forced to beat. It just wasn't put togethor very well and is a chore to complete. Only about 15 minutes of gameplay though. Second is that for the majority of the game you're basically an errand boy.

First, let me say, I bought it on sale, and I'm not sure how I'd feel about paying the full $20.00 for a game with no multiplayer and only a single story campaign (Even though the story is quite long and good for multiple playthroughs) But considering I only forked up a handful of dollars for this gem, I am very satisfied with my purchase.  That being said, if you like immersive storylines, chills, and thrills, Dead Space is for you. DO make sure to go on the forums and follow the instructions to optimize the game for your machine - unless you enjoy watching a slideshow and playing with a mouse that acts like it had a 100lb dumbell attached to it. Dead Space is a great game nonetheless, jsut give it a chance after you fix the bugs. 4/5",

Dead Space is not only a fearful and startling title, it also features some rich gameplay mechanics and an extremely interesting story which gets better as you explore the backstory.

Terrible mouse problems (slightly remedied by turning off in-game vsync and turning ON control panel vsync (playing without vsync is for people who are lower class than rapists.) Stupid, unweildy, frustrating and meaningless inventory and economy management that brings nothing to the table, and does not enrich the game whatsoever. The story is intriguing and mysterious, and the action (while slightly marred by the control/port issues) is tooth-grinding and ferocious. A great musical score, some wonderful and stunning set-pieces and generally excellent voice acting makes this one of my begrudgingly best gaming experiences I've had. The glaring flaws remind me of the flaws that were present in Mass Effect 1. As THAT series progressed, the developers got the picture, learned, and shed the fat to be left with the pure, perfect narrative masterpiece that is the Mass Effect trilogy. I don't expect exactly the same amount of rind to be cut off of the next two Dead Space games, but I hope the inventory, ammo, and controls are cleaner and more streamlined, leaving less between the game and my enjoyment of it.",

But it sure was a good of gore and jumpscares, especially one time I was talking with my friend and suddenly a loud noice from those small three legged aliens popped out and instanly died! I tell, never did I have such a jumpscare!  Anyways, Dead Space is actually worth a shot, and lasts roughly 12 hours, but do note that you should only play on medium, because at one point you want to go to sleep or something else, but the next time you return and click on continue... it will automatically set the difficulty to medium, and it's confirmed from easy to medium and from hard to medium. And you cannot fix it, unless you do some coding with a third party program.  Dead Space is more like a jumpscare game, rather than all creepiness and suspence, but it holds its point in being a little bit scary.   I therefore recommend this game!

You only came to this ship so you could find your girlfriend, and you've already been attacked and hunted by god knows what.  The game does story great, System Shock esque. You find audio and video logs scattered around the Ishimura (ship), which show you the events that happened prior to when the player character(PC) arrives. They vary from combat experience against the creatures from other, now dead survivors. To main events that directly affected the state of the ship, and those which show what led to the PCs role in the game.  Now on the lower difficulties, you'll have enough bullets to beat the campaign than paint the inside of the ship with the leftovers. But on hard difficulty and up, ammo is scarce, healing items and ultilities even more so. This with the atmosphere, and constant alien threat to keep you on your toes, make for an amazing horror game.  10/10",

It's no Cry of Fear, but this game is scary. Having a Necromorph (or worse, more than one) sprint at you as you fumble with your weapons is a very intense experience.

            "review_text": "Let me just say that, before anything else, Dead Space is acceptable. This is stated beforehand just to show that while it didn't give me incredible joy to play, it wasn't stupidly boring despite whatever may occur in the next few paragraphs.  Dead Space takes you through the role of Isaac Clarke, an engineer with little combat experience who goes out to a spaceship where ♥♥♥♥'s gone down and blood's everywhere on the walls and such. The main reason you're there is to find your wife who may or may not be dead but probably is because ♥♥♥♥'s sake look at the first few levels, you think there are actually survivors here? Come on, mate.  The game bills itself as a horror game, but horror it is not. Horror makes me scared to go down a long hallway because the slow build of dark shadows, occasional flecks of blood on the walls and the disturbing music makes me want to hit the escape key and bail out the nearest window. This game, however, is American Horror, also known as 'Here's your hockey mask and Chainsaw, go nuts.'  Be honest the second I made that comparison I realize just how fitting it is; you're in a situation from where there is seemingly no escape, surrounded by nightmarish horrors that want to eat you or worse and your only defense is to dismember them until they stop moving, and to the game's credit that gives it rather fun combat. Being able to viscerally brutalize your enemies by slicing off their limbs one by one is a fantastic way of completely ruining their fun while infinitely increasing yours.  Although I'll be honest the game was more like Call of Duty: Scary Edition, and I was ready to quit a few times, but it always did something that made me go 'Well I suppose that's interesting, lets give it a few more shots.' So it's effective at least.  But the reason I really recommend this game is the same reason I recommended Brutal Legend: Both of them just have fun ways to kill things. In Brutal Legend's case, you had a guitar that could literally bust out a facemelter that melted faces. In Dead Space, you get a gun that's essentially a Saw Whip, which shoots out a sawblade on a gravity tether that you can control and use to slice up enemies like a wedding cake enthusiast in a Fencing class.  It's enjoyable enough, but it's an Action FPS, not a horror game. Just need to get that drilled into you like one of those infestors.",

Once you get used to the basic jumpscares and alien unexpected arrival though... it's no longer frightening. It becomes expected when you go into a certain sized room you are just waiting for the set-up for a fight. That kind of killed it for me, but it still was a good game with it's story and gameplay.   At first I was annoyed by the directly over the shoulder close up camera... but once I got used to it, I was fine. Another con is the inability to reload WHILE running. You have to stop and hit reload, THEN run again and you can keep reloading. Overall good challenge though, worth it when it was on sale for sure for the gameplay, possible replayability and good graphics for a game from 5 years ago.

The set pieces within the game itself are very cohesive and make sense within the design of the USG Ishimura (even if it is basically the same levels as System Shock 2's Rickenbacker). The user interface is very well made, and even adds to the inescapable darkness of the game by providing weak, almost timid glows around the holograms. The weapons themselves are shaky, because if you really want to scare someone you shouldn't make sure they have a ridiculous cushion of firepower to hide behind the second things get out of hand, but Dead Space finds an odd middle ground. See, by adopting the same firing style as Resident Evil 4, the game forces actually using your weapon to be a challenging balance of coordination and time management, because missing a shot with even the most overpowered weapon can mean a game over. Combat in the game is an illusory safety if you're not playing on the easiest setting. Also, the ease in spotting where enemies will likely spawn makes the player paranoid, because you're never sure which vent or hall window will burst if you get too close.  The only real problem with the game is that the soundtrack tries too hard to play catch-up with the game, sounding like the orchestra is being tazed whenever an enemy jumps out. A good horror soundtrack acts as a supplement to the media, only stepping in when the silence actually needs to be filled or when unease is necessary that the game can't create on its own. As it is, the best way to play the game is with the soundtrack muted so that the silence really does hammer home the claustrophobia of the game, which is a shame because Jason Graves has some great music in here.   Overall, it's a solid 6 out of 10. Not the best if you're looking for a really stellar horror game, but it shows that at least it's trying.",

So then you get really excited to see it and you see it and turns out Anchorman wasn't really  that  funny?  Dead Space is kinda like that.  It's not scary.  At all.  It literally breaks every single rule of horror. You get very clear shots of the monsters and know exactly what they look like. There's never a moment where you feel helpless and don't have the means to defend yourself from monsters. You see every scare coming a mile away (oh look, a big open room with lots of vents i wonder whas about to happen??;D??). And it's all jumpscares, too. Maybe the first couple are pretty effective and startling, but they quickly just become a mild inconvenience. Like the game is some kid that keeps flicking rubber bands at you, at first they hurt but after a while you're more concerned with not spilling your drink.  The story is pretty terrible too. Oooooh my gooooosh you've been separated from your team sure hope nothin' bad's gonna happen to them...... Plus, the whole subplot with finding your character's girlfriend is hilariously bad. The main character never speaks and we never see is face and his most emotive gestures are when he occasionally shields his eyes from bright lights - we're supposed to relate to him and feel bad when he finds out his girlfriend was dead all along?  And honestly if you didn't see that coming after the intro cutscene, you probably don't know how to read either so I'm not worried about offending anyone.  It's funny because this game fails at everything it's explicitly trying to accomplish, but it absolutely nails gameplay and setting! Combat is really tight, each gun feels unique and balanced, the freezing and limb-cutting mechanics let you cripple certain enemies and add a lot of versatility to every combat encounter, and there are a lot of monster types that each present a different threat and require different tactics to kill. The art design is gorgeous, too. The Ishimura is full of different and interesting areas so exploring is fun, our character's armor is visually interesting so you never get tired of looking at him, the futuristic aesthetic is maybe not so unique but still interesting, and the HUD-less aspect is immersive and just really well done.  But then there's that stupid Fable 2 SHOW ME WHERE TO GO button that takes a massive dump on any kind of suspense the game would have had and shamelessly encourages meta-gaming. 'Oh I'm supposed to go there? Well I'll just explore here first #yolo' I kept expecting the game to take advantage of that and entice me into a well-laid trap that I wouldn't have sprung if I had just stayed on the 'main path', but don't kid yourself into thinking Dead Space is that smart.

CUT THEIR LIMBS. It shall alternate between moments of exploring quietly with others in which you'll have to walk really slowly to avoid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants. The enemies are mindless and dangerous, the worst kind of foes.  ♢ Story Detailed, compelling, complicated and simple at the same time. If you're a collector like me, you'll have to look everywhere for diaries and audiologs to understand what's going on completely.   ♢ Sound This is the strong point in the game. You're going to hear bladed things creeping in the shadow, in the pipes, in the vents. They'll try to come at you from behind. If you hear a subtle roar, find a closed space and start shooting in front of you.   ♢ Graphics  I've played the entire series on my 360, and good Satan, was i surprised by the difference. The graphics still keep up to these days - okay, maybe a little dated, but not that much -, expecially the particles effects. Light and darkness are really well done.  ♢ Suggestions This game MUST be played with your headphones on. The jumpscares are based also on the music, and you'll say thanks to your digital audio for being able to detect the direction from which the sound came.  Dead Space seems really well optimized: i didn't experience any trouble, expect only one crash to desktop during a cutscene. It runs great on my rig, keeping the FPS at 144.  i7 4790k GTX 980 4G 8 Gb Ram Uh, of course the fov is really limited, to give you a sense of despair in tight corridors. It's not mandatory, but you can download the Widescreen Fix App and set it at the distance you prefer.  I recommend to buy both the games on Steam, and find the third chapter somewhere else. It's an adventure that you won't forget for the rest of your life.",

Despite plenty of people posting mouse settings and whatnot, you can never actually disable the deadzone for the mouse. A deadzone is necessary for controllers, but incredibly obtuse when using a mouse. The sensitivity slider also controls three different aspects: the camera speed when aiming, the camera speed when NOT aiming (ie rotating the camera around your character), and the mouse cursor speed in the menus. Setting the slider for a comfortable speed in one area makes the others too fast or too slow.  If you can play this with a controller, then the game is great, and if you're even remotely interested in this, then you should get it. But if you refuse to use a controller, or don't have one, then it's near unplayable in my opinion.",

Pros: -Good atmosphere made by the music and gory environment. -Plenty of well placed jumpscares along with spooky stuff that isn't necessarily a jumpscare but raises the tension. -A small but unique array of weapons to blast apart the baddies (although I'm a plasma cutter for life). -Interesting narrative with plenty of backstory and notes to add more.  Cons: -Controls are pretty crap. Isaac controls like an old 8-bit tank where you could only turn and move, not both simultaneously. Makes him feel really clunky, especially when you need to be desperately running and gunning to survive. Looking around also has an acceleration to it, so you cannot snap to your target. Instead it feels like you're dragging your reticle through molasses. -Load times are pretty long, whether its a screen or a door that blocks you while spawning the next room. Even on a powerful rig load times are frustratingly long.  Overall: Even with the two gripes, this game is a solid 9/10. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an action-y shooter game while have that layer of horror strapped on top. Definitely recommend it for anyone who hasn't played it before or those looking for a nostalgia trip if you have. Darkness and Headphones are a must while playing!",

Mouse sensitivity is a mess and required turning up to a very high level in game but that translated to the mouse flying around the menus. The game showed my 360 control prompts when I played with mouse/keyboard. The field of view was a sickening 50 or so degrees (estimated) with no way to change it. The hair of one of the characters glitched out leaving a trail of corrupt geometry sprawling across my screen in the first area. The title screens, intro and initial cutscene were long, tedious and unskippable. When I quit and uninstalled the game from steam the 'uninstalling...' steam dialogue box was left spinning permanently leaving me wondering what it left behind as I had to quit and relaunch steam to get rid of it.  I remember enjoying this on 360 many years ago but this is a port to avoid. Maybe if it's deeply discounted and you intend to play with a controller at a good distance from a TV it might be worth gambling on, but there's enough good games on steam you should never need to turn to this mess for entertainment.  Also bear in mind if you did want to play the trilogy you can't get part 3 on steam, it requires EA's Origin platform installed and let loose on your PC.",

            "review_text": "Tedious, relatively boring, pestering, unncessary padding, annoying.  edit: (I beat this game with 11 hours in-game time, it wasn't logged because I played it offline. I played the game on medium/normal difficulty.)  After hearing so much praise for this game, i'm rather surprised it was incredibly lackluster experience for me. I don't think it's because of having good expectations going in and them not living up to them. It was actually just not that good of a game to me.  Dead Space is a game with very cliche story-telling and boring, uninteresting characters who have rather immature fights with each other, and you pretty much just have you shoulder the responsibilites of... everything really. They ask you to do just about everything and spit really menial boring 'story dialouge' at you that I found myself almost passively ignoring because it was just so bland and uninsprired and typical/predictable. Even then, there was hardly a story to really follow, in the sense of, it was really laid out for you. Incredibly simple. There's a church, they have the ishimura on a illegal planet cracking trip to uncover the marker. Then psychotic 'the church' people believe the coming of gods new children are here (the necromorphs) and it's time for humanity to die out and be replaced by the necromorphs which are 'better' than humans. It's just so simple and boring and like, it really only took a couple of logs you pick up in the game mid-to-late game to really just lay out the entire story for you in a nutshell. Everything else is focused on 'survival'. Which is really just an extremely unncessary amount of fetch quests, because apparently, for the most part, not a damn thing in the ship almost the entire game takes place works. Every single new chapter is really just these really baseboards characters whining and crying about how nothing works and nothing is simple and how spooked and scared of the necromorphs they are and how they think (x) is dead.  I ended up just getting infuriated and annoyed by the story design of essentially doing nothing but fetch quests with no new interesting developments or changes to the story. Like yeah they added new characters, but it was just a guy who was like 'The marker is bad, lets' destroy it or give it back.' and then the crazy church guy who was like 'Humans are weak, necromorphs are gods new children, let them take over.'  Woah, totally interesting not cliche boring characters.    Then we get to the gameplay. It was easy, very easy. Too much money floating around, the beginning guns are really good (except the assault rifle) and there's no need to change them. There's no tension or fear I felt fighting the enemies. The atmosphere was boring because you quickly just got used to gore and blood be splattered everywhere and seeing nothing but metal walls, the entire atmosphere just got incredibly tasteless and bland. Rarely did a set do anything to set itself apart from other rooms, and I don't count things like the hospital either, that's just a metal room with medical equipment and tools in it.  Anyways, how was the gameplay easy? The very first gun you get is basically just god-like and really, really good. Not in the sense from the get-go, but giving it mods and developing the thing just turns it into a killing machine. With plentiful of ammo for it always around, I never felt tension or fear cause bullets for the gun that just quickly kills everything was everywhere. And if it wasn't everywhere? ...you buy it! There's so much money in this game and excess of items, I don't think I used one large medpack in this entire game, I just sold them for credits, and ammo for the line gun (one of the first new guns you can acquire) is quite easy to find and I rarely ever used it. So I could sell off the ammo for it for loads of cash, which in turn can be used to buy modules that allow you to mod you guns and make them EVEN MORE POWERFUL! :D  And with that, you can increase your health, increase your air-time in space, increase your guns powers, your power to slow-down enemies.  You can also buy new suits that allow you to carry more stuff, aka more stuff to sell. There's a lot of money lying around in this game, there's lots of items WORTH a lot of money just lying around. Medpacks are in ample supply. I beat this game using nothing but the first two guns you can acquire and the flame thrower to clean up some of the smaller more simple monsters that I don't want to waste ammo on.  And then we get into bad game design. It's incredibly hard not to compare this to resident evil 4 and think about how much wrong there is in this game.  The lack of variety in enemies, how easy it is to dispatch them, how the game constantly spams them at you whenever they can. Now, first off. When I say lack of variety in enemies. They really all just look the same, except some of them have tougher skin. The game showed off new enemy types WAY too far late into the game, and by then, they're very easy to kill, and not very interesting either. Really all the enemies are, are just tentacle babies, and floor crawlers, and then your standard guy standing in their legs and with sycthe arms. To kill enemies in this game, you kill them by cutting off their extremities. I just cut off their legs first and then their arms, to basically immobilize them and then easily cut off their arms.  I don't care to get too much into that, cause it's really just that. Easily lopping off limbs without much of a sweat. Nothing changed to make it more difficult or interesting or dynamic. It was almost... generic. It like just easy enemies lining up for the headshot except their head is their limbs.  The pacing is awful, this game spams enemies at you at every given turn, it's becomes an annoyance. I actually yelled at game game for putting just even more enemies in needless locations. Constantly in tiny rooms, never can go down a big room without some alien attack. It was aggravating and annoying, I couldn't do anything without monsters being there. There's ways to build tension and fear without having boring insessant conflicts all the time. You can't even do the no-gravity space puzzles without being attacked. It's incredibly tiring and annoying.  I don't know, this entire game was a disppointment to me. Most of what I did felt like a chore, combat was easy, I felt no fear or tension, the story was elementary, and the characters were faceless contructs that had relatively nothing to contribute to the 'story' and had I want to say no personality to speak of.  Some people may find enjoyment in this game, because they will perhaps just simply enjoy gunning down zombie-like monsters and exploring the (woefully unexciting) ship and space, and that's fine. Plenty of people enjoyed this game clearly. However I found the experience to be a complete letdown and i'm just voicing why I think that it was not good.  Regardless, thanks for reading my review. I hope it helped you in your decision to get this game or not. Have a good one.  Edit: Also I played this game in its enterity on my xbox 360 controller.",

It's programmed for keyboard keys and that's how it works. That's not all I did, however. So once running I ran the game for about 30 minutes.

It could be safe to say that, while Dead Space did not invent the shock horror genre, it did give it a very strong boost. That said, we are now in a time and year where we've been frequently exposed, if not overexposed, to shock horror and quick scares. Horror in gaming has had to evolve and those that didn't or failed to do so obviously got left behind.  With this little bit of perspective, you should understand that Dead Space (at all times I am talking about the first instalment, I haven't tried the sequels yet) no longer offers any real scares any more. Only those not accustomed to this kind of horror would still feel the dread. And quite frankly, that can't be a whole lot of people any more, let alone 'Gamers'. (if you do happen to find that rare person, videotape it. Those tend to be a real hit on Youtube)  Everything that this game throws at you feels like it 'once' was scary and impressive. Especially as it, if my knowledge doesn't fail me, came in a time when it did a lot of impressive things. It's visual quality was top notch and people hadn't tired fully yet from QTE's.  But that's the thing (and I know I'm harping on it way too much), it just doesn't scare me any more. And you can also see where the concept had it's flaws. Sure, getting grabbed by that huge tentacle and having to timely shoot it's weak spot before it consumes you is a shocker the first time, but when you die... It just starts all over again once you've gotten to that point from your last checkpoint, and the scare factor is completely devoid of it.  In fact, because I was playing on the Hard difficulty, I've had to attempt the second encounter of said tentacle for over TWENTY TIMES. This is partly thanks to the fact I was trying to do a Plasma Cutter only run. Suffice to say I was nothing short of annoyed and bored, eventually. Modern games nowadays tend to include some kind of compensation or balancing so the challenge remains fair but largely doable, unless the game's whole deal is to be unfair.  And that is why I am not recommending it. Not because it would be bad game, not because it would happen to be unfair or brutal. I simply don't recommend it because it's no longer adhering to the standards of modern Horror. Which is largely to blame for the genre itself evolving and drastically changing recently.  If you would get the game, get it for the nostalgia and to understand where the genre 'used to be'. Just don't expect a product that will knock you off your socks.",
