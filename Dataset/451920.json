            "review_text": "ENG: After playing a little bit in this game, I can say: this game is gorgeous!  Pros of the game: 1) Very interesting story about a prisoner, whom we will play. 2) Good fighting game system, not like in other games of this genre 3) Very nice graphics and textures  4) Courage (imho) soundtrack, which you want to hear and listen to (and you want kick ♥♥♥ when listen this music - check 1st achewement hahaha) 5) Very cheap price, and how many hours you spend it! (Even now there is a discount of 40%) and for the trading card you will be able to pay back part of the price. Also there are achievements. 6) Easy saving + SteamCloud  Of the minuses I can say that there are some minor bugs and problems with resolution and I cant make a screenshot - game is starting from beginning. I recommend to buy the game and support the developer. And all their problems or ideas please write directly to his mail or steam discussions, he will answer for all. (Because he's a good person and open to dialogue)  P.S. Dialogs in game contain hard words, so be carefull if you play with children  RU: После того, как я поиграла немного в эту игру, я могу сказать: эта игра великолепна! Плюсы игры: 1) Очень интересный рассказ об узнике, за которого мы будем играть. 2) Хорошая система боя, не такая, как в других играх этого жанра 3) Очень красивая графика и текстуры (для RPG Maker) 4) Заводной (имхо) саундтрек, который вы хотите слышать и слушать (а еще хочется наподдать под зад кому нибудь под эту музыку - смотрите 1-ое достижение хахаха) 5) Очень небольшая цена, зато сколько часов вы проведете в ней! (Даже сейчас есть скидка в размере 40%), а также вы сможете погасить часть цены коллекционными карточками. Кроме того, есть достижения. 6) Простая система сохранений + облачное сохранение Из минусов могу сказать, что есть некоторые незначительные ошибки и проблемы, связанные с разрешением и я не могу сделать скриншот - игра начинается с начала. Я рекомендую покупать игру и поддержать разработчика. Обо всех проблемах или идеях, пожалуйста, пишите прямо на его почту или в обсуждениях стим, он ответит на все. (Потому что он хороший человек и открыт для диалога) P.S. Диалоги в игре содержат жесткие слова (англ), так что будьте осторожны, если вы играете с детьми",

            "review_text": "Thorne - Death Merchants - good game. She is interested in. It's fun to play. I am really enjoying Thorne - Death Merchants. The game is made by the studio Lone Wolf Games and Aldorlea Games. The great thing about Lone Wolf Games and Aldorlea Games is that they put time and effort into making good rpg. Part of people may be turned off when they see its an rpg maker game but trust me if its made by Aldorlea games they have put alot of effort into it.  The music is really well done and its easy to see that the devs have put their heart into making this game same as the other games from Aldorlea games and Lone Wolf Games.",

            "review_text": "This is an action rpg in the classic style that has been beautifully done, featuring a great story, game mechanics with an easy learning curve, interesting characters all around, excellent supporting music, and gorgeous graphics. The story opens with the protagonist (Thorne ---- 'the Crow') in jail where he tells his story of the developments that got him there. It very quickly gets your attention.  Gameplay mechanics are a bit different (real time combat), but with only a minimum amount of time ---- and with the in-game help ---- you will pick up the system being used with ease, and be on your way to explore the world. And careful exploration is a must to reveal the clues of the interesting, cleverly laid out puzzles, and picking up the treasures that are plentifully distributed throughout the game. Search everywhere to find the many clues that drive the plot ---- you never know what you'll find, whether it be health items, accessories, or scraps of paper that you will find to be important.  You should talk to all characters, and talk again to the same characters after events transpire as they will add more to the story.  Graphics/art ---- very detailed, lush, and superbly done ---- show a lot of attention to detail that indicates a considerable amount of care went into this one.  At the price being asked, this one is an absolute must, especially for those that enjoy the classic games. And it's on sale this week. Grab this one for sure.",

I am a dedicated streamer over on Beam.pro and I streamed this game for my viewers and the response was fantastic.  This game is a very well done RPG. The graphics and the art are top notch. And the story line is a very well rounded one.  However I do have some minor complaints, but I will list them momentarily. This game is a very refreshing game because it is different. It reminds me of childhood and it has a very nostalgic feel to it.   And it's only 1.79? You can't go wrong with that!!  Pros: Great art Great story Quests are detailed Characters have personalities Overall great game!  Cons: No way to maximize window I would prefer to use WASD to move instead of click and hold   Other than those to minor complaints, I love this game and I reccomend it to anyone who is an RPG fan! Pick it up now, it's a steal for this price!",

You're basically in this one town and you get a few quests (about ten including side quests) to learn some history of it's residents and the surrounding country...the game just felt like just an introduction - there was no real climax or ending.  EDIT: Was experiencing major lag - but after upgrading to Windows 10 the problem somehow fixed itself, so...",

Add to this a great plot, interesting quests and unique combat system. Looking forward to the continuation! The game is pretty interesting, soundtracks fit the locations, the story is good and the gameplay is pretty nice. Overall the game is enjoyably and for this price it's fair deal.",
