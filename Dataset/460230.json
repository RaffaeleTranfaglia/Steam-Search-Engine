            "review_text": "I should start this by saying I am not a massive fan of horse racing. I came upon an early incarnation of this game a few years ago and have been a fan since.  The game allows for different levels of play varying from betting only mode through to training and ownership. You can jockey your own horses or combine the complex mode of owner/trtainer with a simplified training model (my own preference as somebody who has an amateur knowledge of horse racing).  The statistical level of the game has comparisons with Football Manager and it is no coincidence that both games are my 'go to games'. The game you play when you've tired of the latest new game.   The fact that this is now on Steam is a major plus as this is a game that has been regularly updated and improved. For anybody who knows very little about horse racing but loves statistical management games or anybody who loves horse racing and likes a punt now and then this is defintely worth investing in.",

            "review_text": "I have enjoyed playing Starters Orders since the days when it was called Stable Masters on the Amiga all those years ago it was a basic game back then but over time it has improved with every reincarnation.  If you enjoy Management games this is a must for you even if you have never watched a horse race this will fullfil your hunger for more and more you can't breed your own Football Player but you can breed your own Grand National or Derby winner even the American triple crown winner this game will keep you busy for hours and with the 3D Graphics and Jockey Mode this is the Best the Sport Of Kings game around.  Once you think your unbeatable you can then test your horses against other trainers horse's in the Online League with 13 weeks of Action on the Flat and over the Jumps taking all the best races around the world on the flat from all the classics like the Dubai World Cup the English Classics like the Guineas to the USA Breeders Cup and the Melbourne Cup From Australia and the Jumps Taking all the big races through to the Cheltenham Festival and the Aintree Grand National the league is run by Volumteers and you can watch the races with actual real commentary provided by other trainers on You Tube the league has it own Website so for the price of £20 this is a must buy game.

            "review_text": "If you're into horse racing, then you will love this game. As others have said, it's very similar to Football Manager in that it is a simulation game, although I know you can control the jockey too but I haven't really tried this before.  This is the 3rd SO in the series that I've bought, and got to say I love them - I would love to see Mark get the rights to use real names etc in the future.",

            "review_text": "I know nowt about horses. Sod all about betting. Never even seen a horse race. When one comes on the telly and it's skipped immediately, no interest.   But as a lazy gamer, reaching that age where I enjoy a good management sim without having to worry too much about all the intracies of making cash/building an army/running a hospital/theme park etc this is right up my street.  Kick back, look at lists of horses, hire winning jockeys, read the form book, study trainers...and then just put everything on a horse that has the funniest name.  You can build your own farm but it doesnt need micro managing, just plough your winnings into new facilities and it looks after itself.   There is some skill in this I'm sure, but thats not why I'm here. Just a few hours of occasional mouse clicks, lots of reading and then getting unbelievably excited when your 5 furlong nag starts to pull away in a 2 mile steeple chase.  I've made a shed load of cash, lost a shed load more and learned new things (like how long a furlong is to start with!).  It's just a whole heap of relaxing fun. Casual gamers will love this as much as I'm sure the Horse Racing purists do.   big thumbs up.   ",
