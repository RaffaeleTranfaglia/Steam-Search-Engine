            "review_text": "I've never before seen a developer work so hard into making a poor product shine. That alone makes this title worthy of picking up.  I have been playing pen and paper RPGs for over 30 years and computer RPGs since the late 80s, so I suppose I am more forgiving on graphics quality than some. What I fiend for in games are interesting combat systems and diverse skills. So far, this title doesn't disappoint.   I feel that watching my fledgling characters grow as the adventure progresses will be quite gratifying in this title. I can't wait to get into some serious questing.  One thing I still can't stand in this game is the English language voice acting. They need some serious help in the voiceover depatment. Monotonous doesn't even begin to describe the voice work, though it may be an ESL issue.  Regardless, this is a small quibble about a product that has been considerably improved over the last few weeks. I am excited to see what other new features and improvements are introduced in the weeks and months to come.  -T",

The opening city is truly huge, with shops and tavens. Ive made a name for myself playing the flute! I like the voice discriptions, it feels like a real Pen and Paper experience, reminds me of the Dungeons and Dragons Online in that it is narrated. Ive been looking for a game like that for a long time! At times it reminds me of Eye of the beholder (in the dungeon crawling) and other times like heroes of might and magic (in the combat). I tried the orginal from GOG, and enjoyed it but have found this, with its updated graphics and narrated discriptions better. I would recommend this to anyone who likes deep roleplaying. Give it a few hours and let it grow on you. I'm really glad i took a punt!  Probably ought to note there is no tutorial, and its pretty hard core and plays best on my rig in windowed mode.",

            "review_text": "Before i go into why i disliked this game i want to note that i haven't played original (1993) because of which i bear no nostalgia towards this game.  Combat was horrible, instead of being interesting and trying to put any effort into strategies all my character miss all hits almost every time, this is exactly how combat was to me, miss x4, hit, and again miss, such combat is boring, repetitive and it isn't absorbing as it should have been in Turn based system.  Locations ... most of the locations bear no useful purpose besides stores with pretty much same things you can buy in every other city, most have no quests, interesting events or anything of the sorts, they just feel empty. On the other hand i think that dungeons and caves were amazing it may be just because pretty much rest of the game is so boring that dungeons were a good change and resulted in being quite fun.  Graphics for indie game i guess are good, but i as person who doesn't care about graphics of any game i can't say whether they are good or bad.  Besides dungeons one other thing that i thought was good were some details this game has, for example: to capture map where you have been you need light source ( torch or magic spell), this is just one example of many like if you have ropes you can get through some hole etc.  I did also like DLCs as they had relatively long quests compared to others this game has or at least the ones i found in pointless locations. New interesting locations and items to find, was improvement over base game.  You may like this game if you played original, you may give it a try if you already own it, but i personally can't recommend you to buy it.",

I fell ill after only 30 minutes gameplay and this was too long! I am known for playing shooters or RPG's for sometimes over 8 hours but this one is a torture!

Both cpu and video card are above Steam's minimum specs and it's super choppy and jumpy. I installed it on my Lenovo G50 laptop with an AMD A8 APU @ 2.0Ghz with Radeon R5 graphics. The cpu is below specs but the R5 graphics are enough for it to run. It's occasionally choppy but runs fine otherwise. I have a lot of hours from testing the various graphics settings and occasionally restarting from earlier points. I like it and would recommend it only at Steam's recommended specs or above. I'm going for a better video card for my desktop so I can get better enjoyment from playing. The manual I downloaded hardly explains anything and the in game help sucks. For the Twelve!",

What however really impressed me was how the developers continued to work night and day for the better part of half a year to make good on their mistake. The outcome is now a game that is actually really fun to play and captures the spirit of the old game exactly how I had hoped for for the release. So now it is a 4.5 out 5 !",
