            "review_text": "An amazing second effort by Dead Mage- whose only past works had been the competent, yet middling Garshasp: The Monster Slayer, and its terrible stand-alone expansion Temple of the Dragon. Were it not for the listing on Steam or their logo in the intro, you'd have no idea that the same studio that made Garshasp made this game- the margin in quality is that vast.  Shadowblade: Reload is an action platformer with an emphasis on fast-relexes based around the small, yet versatile toolset the game gives you. Double-jumps, air-dashes, and LOTS of wall-jumping are the name of the day here. So there isn't a whole lot of variety in the actions you can perform- but the game is aware of this and thus enforces the need for a good handle on the nuances of these mechanics for players who want good stage-times or all the collectables. The controls generally do a decent job of allowing you to keep up with the pace of the game- though unfortunately they aren't perfect, occasionally glitching out and causing a cheap death here and there.  There is also combat in the game- though it is much weaker than the platforming. Most enemies can be easily killed by just throwing shurikens at them or performing your sword attacks in time while charging at them. Now this doesn't work on all enemies- the larger enemy types tend to require more specific methods to be dispatched... In theory. That is until you realize that ALL of them- except for a single enemy type- are insta-killed by your aerial drop attack. Even without that knowledge- there really isn't much to the combat at all, making the combat arenas the game occasionally throws at you the most boring parts of the game. The surprising contrary to that are the few boss battles in the game- all of which are actually pretty decent.  At least the animations for the combat are quite good as well- that's its main redeeming factor. In fact, Shadow Blade's graphics are quite solid overall for the most part. It runs well at a solid clip without losing a step and- again- has some pretty good animation for everything going on. The glitchy ragdoll physics and poorly done shadow effects are the main weak points. (I advise you leave shadows off in the options menu, they just don't add much and don't look good at all.)  It should be noted that the game can glitch out in ways that force level restarts though. Bugs I ran into included getting stuck at the end of an enemy introduction cutscene, getting stuck in a ledge grab animation on specific ledge corners, and falling out of the level when standing on a sliding door. Nothing game-breaking, since full level restarts generally fix them, but still annoying when they come up.  Overall a great pick for platformer fans. Especially for those who like them fast-paced and/or speed-run focused. Good value as well- with its campaign levels being playable on three difficulty levels and the game having a level editor with Steam Workshop compatibility.   Pros:  - Simple, yet versatile fast-paced platforming action  - Solid controls  - Well done graphics and animations  - Surprisingly good boss fights (Though there's really only 3 of them)  - Good amount of content: All of the game's main levels have at least slight alterations through three difficulty levels, and there's a level editor with Steam Workshop support   Cons:  - Somewhat buggy in places.  - The controls are generally on point- but occasionally glitch out as well  - Overly simplistic combat and enemy types",

            "review_text": "I stumbled across Shadow Blade: Reload randomly before it was even out. Already looking quite cool, I noticed that Shadow Blade was on iOS, so I bought it. It had me so hooked, I instantly bought the Android version and simul-played it using Bluestacks. Later on, I completed both of them once again on newer hardware, and even the free version of the game called Shadow Blade Zero (Android). Bought this Steam release in early access and then bought it again on iOS and have 100% completed both. But why?  This game is kind of like the love child of Strider 2 and Shinobi 3D. It's fast paced, focuses on platforming and minimal effort put into actual combat (you are required to end enemies ASAP). All of it is done extremely well, from the well made level design to the careful enemy placement. Everything just clicks.  It also controls like a charm. Kuro is easy to handle, he can double jump, dash in air, use several different ways to attack, wall kicks when needed and puts many other ninja video game characters to shame.  The music is catchy, but nothing to write home about. Ever now and then I catch myself humming some of the better tracks, but it could be better.  The game is not perfect, every version of it (even the originals) has collision problems, stuff ending rather abruptly, enemies glitching up or spawning at incorrect places. Sometimes it can get frustrating. I don't care.  I don't care because I REALLY, REALLY loved this game. There's no perfect video game but as long as most of the game clicks together as in Shadow Blade: Reload, I will enjoy it. Can I recommend it? Hell yeah, it's easily one of the best ninja games out there and if you like those, or are into retro games, this will surely satisfy your needs.  It will last a while too. The game has three difficulty modes all with altered level designs and enemy placements, a challenge mode that offered some of the best thrills I've experienced in recent years (gaming-wise) and even a stage creation tool that also has the ability to upload it to the masses easily.  I get it, this isn't really a review and it certainly doesn't help that I'm raving over this game. But look at that trailer. If you think the game looks cool even just a little bit, you should probably buy it. I doubt it'll disappoint.  Still, I feel like this game was made for me. I have no other way to explain why I love it so much. It just clicks with me. Thanks for the awesome work, devs.",

            "review_text": "Shadow Blade: Reload basically plays like a mashup of   Mark of the Ninja  and   Super Meat Boy . Differentiating itself from those titles, it has an emphasis on speed running. The controls are very tight and do not feel floaty or loose, which is important in a game with platforming elements. All in all, this game is very enjoyable. Highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of metroidvania and platforming. If you liked   Guacamelee  then you will most likely like this game too.",
