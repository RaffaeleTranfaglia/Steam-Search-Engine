It also featured a block-based puzzle where you could go head to head with your friend.  However, Almightree fails to deliver. The puzzles are fine, but the game simply does not feel polished enough.  The controls are really clunky, and unresponsive. The head to head is very awkward. It's just weird that you cannot spectate your friend once you're dead to see his progress, and instead needs to wait in the dark until he's done.  I liked the concept of the game, but I definitely did not like the execution.",
