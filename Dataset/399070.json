I finished the game in a single sitting and I imagine most people will do the same. I like to avoid bringing time and money into it and focus on the experience. If you were going into a café for the first time, you might be disappointed with how the coffee tastes. I’d say you’re far more likely to enjoy Dragon’s Wake than you are a coffee from an unknown barista and you’re looking at the same price for the experience.

Then you find egg of an new dragon and you must protect and teatch it. This game is like crossover of Spyro the dragon and Skyrim and its awesome.  Gameplay is very smooth and graphigs are amazing. This game is one of my favourite puzzle games and it has potenttial to be the game of the year.",

I found it had a good element of difficulty and the boss fight was qiute hard but after defeating him i had a great sense of accomplishment. Overall, its a great platformer and i had a great time playing it. I highly reccomend it to anyone reading this.",

The game is also able to convey emotions without walls of text telling you how to feel which is always a plus in my opinion. The only complaint I have is that the final boss feels a little too difficult, but that isn't a huge deal in the grand scheme as the rest of the game was so good. Many would say that the artwork is 'amatureish', but personally? I actually liked it, since it gave the game charm and some personallity, so if you enjoy 2D platformers, dragons and going on a small but enjoyable adventre, I recommend picking this game up. &lt;3",

This game might be short , but it is very well made !!! And i really mean it .  It has trading cards and steam achievements , so that is another plus from me . Another thing, I bet this game will make you cry in the end and not only .",

Pretty much anything can run them. - Autosave between each loading screen - Decent music   Neutral - Many loading screens, but they're short. - The art in the loading screens could have been done better. - No dialogue. - The story got me partly interested. - There are allegedly ways to change some things, but I have no idea how, and there are pretty much no walkthroughs  - Short game.  Cons: - The controlls are displayed in the background as XBOX controlls.  - The path is not always clear. They have candles that light the way, but they're not everywhere. - The controlls are a bit wonky - No manual save. - No loading back. Once the game has saved, it's saved. No going back, unless you start a new save. - The camera slowly pans to whichever side you're facing. Not always noticable when moving, but could have been done better. - 'Health Packs' Distrubution is done mostly poorly. For the most part are there many where very few are needed, but where some are needed, are they very scarce.   - You are not told how to defeat the final boss, and it's a puzzle you must figure out for yourself, after many tries, because he can and will kill you quickly, if you don't know what to do. There are also no Health packs in the boss room.  ",

The story told through music, loading screen and background props. No words.  The control although feeling a bit wonky and imprecise, it does gives a good flight feeling. The combat, you can bite and breathe fire, eating corpse restores your HP and gives additional ability from special enemy, and grow larger, which gives stomp ability when growth enough.  Game length is about 1-2 hours. But have multiple ending. Short, yet charm.  This is a must for dragon lover, even though a platformer gamers are also recommended as well. --- TH --- Dragon's Wake เป็นสั้นเกมแนว Platformer 2D ที่มีเนื้อเรื่องเกี่ยวกับมังกรผู้ซึ่งเกิดมาในช่วงที่อยู่ระหว่างการฆ่าล้างมังกรกำลังจากอศวินดำปริศนา  เกมนี้เนื้อเรื่องจะถูกนำเสนอผ่าน ดนตรีและภาพประกอบในระหว่างฉากโหลดหรือตามพื้นหลังของฉาก ไม่มีคำพูด  กาควบคุมได้อารมณ์การบินร่อนของมังกรดี แต่อาจรู้สึกแปลกๆในตอนต้นและไม่ค่อยแม่นยำ การต่อสู้ สามารถกัดหรือพ่นไฟได้ สามารถกัดกินศัตรูเพื่อฟื้นพลังได้ และการกินศัตรูพิเศษจะเพิ่มความสามารถและเติบโตเราซึ่งจะได้ทักษะการกระทืบเมื่อโตพอสมควร  ความยาวของเกมอยู่ประมาณ 1-2 ชม. แต่มีหลายฉากจบ สั้น แต่มีเสน่ห์จากส่วนประกอบของเกม  สำหรับคนที่รักมังกรแล้วถือว่าแนะนำเลย หรือแม้แต่ผู้ที่ชอบ Platformer ก็แนะนำ เพราะระบบการบินร่อน",

I greatly enjoy the artstyle of the game, music, and the drawn art inbetween loading areas. I enjoy the lack of a narrator or words; the environment and music tell the story, which you discover on your own. There are few choices in the game that effect the ending, and on a first play through you might miss out on them.   The game tugged at my heartstrings. There is as much sad as there is joy to be found; as much hope as there is despair. Without going into spoilers, I sympathized for the dragons, and the lizardfolks, luaghed and was greatly saddened at the losses they incurred.   I would love to see a sequel from this developer.",

            "review_text": "This game has a very interesting story, as in, you don't play as the dragon-slaying knight, who just kills every dragon in sight (for whatever reason), but instead you play as a little dragon who's just hatched from his egg and see it all from the exact opposite, as you have to fight a dragon-slaying knight instead.  I won't really say much about the story here, so I'll only say that, while I really like the storyline of this game, the fights are a bit unbalanced, so that most usual enemies are really easy to kill, though when you'll reach the final boss, he's so strong, that you're probably going to die at least a few times, before even being able to kill him.  Then there's also the fact of the rather simple explanations of how to use your abilities... you don't even get told some of them, but rather have to either find them out on your own (like I did), or try to find another source from which you could learn them.  On another note, this game has quite a few places at which you'd better consider your actions, since some of them  will  have an effect on the end.  Though all in all, I'd probably give this game a 8/10, just beacuse some things aren't perfect, but I still pretty much love it and definitely don't regret buying it.",
