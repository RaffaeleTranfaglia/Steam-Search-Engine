            "review_text": "I try to keep a large view of things when thinking about what to say about games when I talk about them to friends or other people. I will attempt to be as unbiased when writing this review. I will warn those of you that are reading this that there might be some spoilers, but seeing how I finished this game in about 2 hours-ish while trying to figure out how some of the characters sounded like when they were speaking, I don't think you'll mind as much. If you speed read I think you might be able to finish this in maybe 20 Minutes - 50 Minutes, depending on how fast you can actually read. I visited their website and it says that it is their first Original English Language Visual Novel that wil be published on Steam. I assume this just means that it is the first OELVN to make it onto Steam. Now onto the review.  Peronsally, I felt that this game could've been more... There is a lot of potential in this game, especially in games where it should focus mainly on the story, while giving players a choice to choose where the story goes. A visual novel by any other name. But this was more of a... digital book, instead of a VN. It gave you only a single choice for the duration of the entire game, which honestly disappointed me. Not only because I only had one choice through the entirety of the game, but it had such little impact on the story that the second time I went through it to choose the other option the only thing that changed was who you went with to the festival. Everything else remained the same.  The story was somewhat generic, but I love stories. However, this story seemed to go at too fast a pace. Things were happening much too quickly and the story advanced way too fast. Situations changed from confused and nervous, to happy and perverted, to sad and somber, and then to happy and perverted again faster than flipping a coin and watching it fall on the table.   In no time at all you've already, somehow, made it through several days, and then somehow you made it through an entire week! Then suddenly you are shoved through a portal that takes you back into the world where Takahiro was originally from. No explanation as to how that portal appeared, but it did. You got shoved through it. Good job.  I'm not saying that there wasn't a lot of scenarios, because there were a fair amount of scenarios. They just felt rushed in hindsight. They came in much too abruptly, and ended far too quickly, and then another scenario comes in just as abruptly as the last one did. There is no breather, no build-up, it's just one thing after another. There could have been more pauses to lengthen the story, some dry spots where the characters could get to know each other better. But they all seemed to get along pretty well in some very perverted situations.  But then the characters! The characters! One of the key items to any good story is the characters! But they just don't have any... definition. Nothing to define them, nothing to make them stand out, make them more unique. They're just sort of there, with a REALLY quick and sad backstory. But even then most of the characters don't have backgrounds and the game conveniently states that they all don't remember their past. Just... kind of sounds lazy to me... I'm being honest. There's little heart-warming bonding moments between the characters. They just... kind of splash water on each other and show each other their semi-naked bodies. That's all I remember from those 'Bonding' moments.  The artwork is very nice! Pretty much all I have to say on the artwork.  There were also some spelling and grammatical errors and typos.  So to reiterate,   -Generic story, but I like any kind of story that can take my attention. -Scenes go by really fast.  -Characters are there, but they lack definition. -Really short game. I got through it in about 2 and a half hours. -Lack of choices for a VN, therefore a lack of results and consequences. -More of a digital book with pretty pictures.  At the end it said something about a 'prologue'. I hope that they will add in new chapters for free and not make us pay for it seperately. In the end I would say the $7.49 I spent on it was worth the pictures. I know how painful it can be to draw pictures like that. Even if you know what you are doing, drawing things like those in the game is a time consuming activity. I would not say that it is worth $9.99 however.  That is my review thank you for reading this lengthy thing, but I felt that it had to be done. I give Sakura Spirit a 6.5/10 simply for the drawings.",

This review may also spoil the game, so you have been warned.  Pros: -Funny, interesting, and cute characters throughout the game. -Wacky, funny, and flat-out insane scenarios the main character ends up in, as fitting for the Sakura franchise. -Tells a complete story, and said story has a very happy ending. (personally, that's the best part) :steamhappy:  Cons: -Story is waaaayyyyy too short. I prefer lengthier 'games' like this. Perfect examples are GBDNATE and Max's Big Bust. -There is no nudity, in spite of the game's page saying there is. And even with the 'nude' scenes, the girls are covered up in one way or another. -Only one choice in the entire game. And it doesn't even matter because it's just 2 pathways to take to reach the same ending. -Seemingly promises some sexual content, but all we get is just some what appears to be half-♥♥♥♥♥ innuendos and ♥♥♥♥-blockings.  These are the simple pros and cons of the game that I have noticed. I know there's more that people would put into the list, but I'm just making a general overview. Personally, I would have liked to see several choices that lead to several outcomes. Like, what if Takahiro never did go to the shrine? What if he decided NOT to escape with Maeko and Machiko? What if he decided NOT to attend the festival? What if Tsuyuki had never interfered in the first place? Alot of questions like these would have to be answered by the devs themselves. But, i'm getting off topic.  For my opinion of the game, i've got a mixed review. For the Sakura franchise, it's a decent filler if you're waiting for different things. If you don't care about how long it takes to get through, (or just want to see boobs) then I would say get this game. However, in the broad scheme of things, it's not as good as some 'games' like GBDNATE and Max's Big Bust, which have a wide cast of funny, unique characters that go through wacky scenarios and have very decent quality behind them. The dev of those 2 told me himself that he aims for those things: a quality game/visual novel/whatever you wanna call it, with quality, and a cast of funny, unique characters. I'm not saying Sakura Spirit was BAD persay. I'm just saying it was short and could have been better executed. Overall, it's not something I would recommend for fans of this franchise.   Sorry if i ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anyone off, but i'm giving an honest review, trying to keep my views as unbiased as possible.  Until next time.",

As his tournament gets closer, he gets nervous and asks friends for advice, they tell him to pray in a shrine in order to get good luck. Takahiro follows their advice, enters the shrine looking to pray and then meets a spirit telling him he must do something to improve himself as a warrior. He's transported into another dimension and it just goes downhill from here, as this nice plot just dies in the process. I like to think the writers got bored and didn't care for whatever they put in the 'story' because it's embarrassing to see someone find this entertaining, let alone tolerable [Yes, I mean the perverts too.]  Some tags used in the store to describe this game are also wrong: Nudity: No no, those who gave this tag are either upset parents or prepubescent boys who've never seen cleavage on the internet. May I also add that, like every other reasonable review has stressed, nipples [and genitalia] aren't visible, so you're pretty much just looking at a blank chest. I think it's hilarious the amount of people that use this for self-pleasure, since there is absolutely nothing sexually appealing about the scenes used to allure the audience. The many moments with the so-called nudity happen randomly and it's more effective than a jumpscare. Moments include you walking into a room, turning on the lights and see a girl naked covered in chocolate, her begging you to get intimate and you refuse, because obviously you're a gentleman for playing this game.  Dating Sim: LOL. You'll be disappointed to hear that your character has nothing to do with the girls and/or foxes. In fact, there is only one choice near the end of the novel and it doesn't affect any relationship you develop with any of them. Honestly, making this game a dating sim would've been the right way to go because of it's suggestive themes, but i guess we all don't get what we want now do we? Mature: More than half of the people who played this are immature, and it doesn't even take a mature person to know this is horrible.  You can get more entertainment off the community hub which is full of screenshots that speak for the game itself.  Once you buy it, be prepared for the judgmental messages you'll receive from your friends or siblings. The only good thing about it is the cost of the trading cards, if you're lucky enough, you'll get a foil card which is worth more than this crap.",

But a visual novel, as the name should actually say for itself, is nothing more than a novel with graphics. You read it and don't play it. So if you're into japanese style VN then you should check Sakura Spirit out since the story is, for a western made VN kind of good. I got it when it was in sale so it dind't seem like the short story was a waste of money. And for all the people who are not into Visual Novels or don't have any experience with them.

I  think  I got this in a bundle somewhere, or possibly for 2 bucks I had left over on a sale. Not sure anymore.  I'm also not very partial to Visual Novels, but I  have  played a few now and then, and this is very clearly nothing like, say, the excellent and deep 'Katawa Shoujo'. Which is free by the way.  Seeing the full 10 Euro price tag of 'Sakura Spirit', I can't help but feel sad for anyone intentionally buying this. In my mind only fanboys having lost all their judgement can actually like this.  + Art style is pleasant enough, though nothing special.  + / - Story is thin to say the least, although I admit the idea behind it, the 'universe' it takes place in is somewhat interesting if one likes such things. Too bad the story itself is your very basic anime fare without any strong points.  - Way too short for a visual novel. More like a novelette. Look at my playtime - Full playthrough. Yep that's it for 10 bucks. Only took so long because I actually read it.  - No meaningful choices. In fact, if I recall correctly, only one had to be made, putting you on either side of two opposing parties without much impact at all besides what gummy bear boobs you get to see. Read below.  - Not that I need nudity for a VN (so many are basically plain porn, I just don't see the point), but the tag and warning is a joke. There  are  some suggestive lines to be read, and some pictures are a bit on the skimpy side clothes wise, but that's about it. The very few actual nude pictures are basically boobs  without nipples . So... maybe the tag is warranted after all. A young boy who never (consciously) saw boobs in his life before might be deeply disturbed by this once he gets to see real ones. I will call this type of thing 'Gummy Bear Nudity' from now on.  Should really be 'Mild suggestive themes and visuals' instead of 'Explicit'.  Also 'Warning, may confuse your kid because nipples are what's wrong with showing nudity to teens'.  Obviously only for fanboys with too much money who wouldn't recognize a good visual novel if it hit them square in the non-existant nipples.   2/10 - Avoid if you expect actual mature entertainment and an interesting story   Disclaimer:   No fanboys were harmed during the creation of this review, and no actual offense is intended towards possibly existing Sakura fans. This is a subjective review, written from my experience with this title. I do know certain people just buy something like this for REASONS beyond my comprehension, and I do not claim them to be wrong about their chosen addiction. I just don't understand it. ",

Games require as per their definition the ability to play them, and this piece of software does not meet that definition in the most basic sense. The software consists entirely of one choice towards the end of the story, and in fact has more choices when configuring the preferences than when playing it.  As a review of the software, as I'm now calling it, it had a very nice interface. With transparancy, and a nice clean and consistent look with many sakura flowers. The save feature had multiple image slots for save games to show exactly where each save in the storyline was. It also featured many preferences, however some of them were lacking in ability. The auto story mode could only be configured from impossibly slow to painfully slow leaving you reading the text far faster than the next line appeared. The other features seemed to work as expected text speed, skip feature, and volume controls.  The software featured all of the expected tools for the type of game it attempted to be without any of the gameplay. The art of the software was well done, and enjoyable. The story was great as a sort of satire of the common tropes of this genre, and perhaps the utter lack of gameplay was again a satire on the genre, however, I found it went too far.  Overall you should not buy this game, but if you enjoy these types of games this may be worth a purchase for the laughs.",

This plot isn't the best quality about this game, its quite generic and predictable. The highlight of this game would be the the high quality artworks. This game has a lot of nudity and partial nudity, so play at your own eyes expense. I reccomend this game only because it is accurately advertised with the videos you find on the store page, I would not recommend actually playing this game unless what you're looking for is a cheaply put together story with high quality perverted images. I personally enjoyed this game because i didn't think the game makers would actually take the sex jokes and perversion as far as they did, so it has no replayability for me since its no longer a surprise, but was interesting in the first playthrough.",

A visual novel with good art. It was short. My playtime involves going through the whole story once (even with saving and going back a bit because there was a 'choose your own adventure' type choice).  I find the tags of this game to be misleading. Is there scantily clad females? Yes. Does it get close to being full on nipples and other female genetalia? Yes.   Does it? No. So Nudity is kinda misleading.   Dating Sim (To include Simulation)? No. If it were a sim, there'd be a semblance of choice in the game, meaning you'd influence the story in any way. This game doesn't allow that (not to be a mark against it. It is what it is).  Also, 'This game includes nudity and explicit sexual dialog.'? Not really. No nudity, as already pointed, and there's no explicit sexual dialog that I noted. Bunch of hintbombs, but no sort of 'I want your ♥♥♥♥♥* in my ♥♥♥♥♥♥*' (replace starred words with equivilant slang terms).  For what it is, it is a good visual novel. The characters lack depth at times, and the game does seem to go out of its way to show you some scantily clad female art, but I enjoyed it.",

Good scripting - the protagonist is actually relatively genre-savvy. Decent character development considering the length of the game. The fight scenes are pretty well written, although it feels like a couple CGs would have done nicely in the fights. I think the typos mentioned in other reviews have been fixed - I haven't spotted any, myself.  However: as a visual novel and game, compared to others of its kin, it somewhat falls flat. There's only one storyline choice (which affects the last part of the story before the ending, and both are necessary for all CGs) and the whole thing lasts about an hour if you're a quick reader like me. Also, the save function is more of a bookmark - and also a fast track to said story-line split.  Totally worth the read/fap, especially if it's on special offer. Giggity.",

You click through dialog like you would turn pages in a book.  Now then. The game has amazing art. It's really nice to look at, even if it isn't 1920x1080.  However, it is short. Very, very short. Reading at normal speed, you'll probably blaze through it in an hour. Slow readers can expect about two hours. It doesn't help that the story itself isn't very brilliant, nor does it have good flow... it feels more like a series of sketches that they threw together than a singular story. The ending is also very, very abrupt.  Music wise, it's okay. Nothing terrible, nothing great. It's just... there to follow the mood. No, it doesn't succeed in setting the mood, it just follows it.  Sakura Spirit feels like an experiment more than anything else. 'Hey guys, should we make 24 images, some avatars, some backgrounds, some music, throw some sort of stub story in there and see if there's a market for visual novels in Steam?'  For full price, I can't recommend it to anyone. It's simply too short AND lacking in substance (short stories can hold their own if they're good - this is nothing of the sort). If you're a fan of visual novels, -66% or below might be worth it for the pretty pictures. Or you could throw a middle finger to the devs and just find the CG set somewhere, I guess.

            "review_text": "Decency, please.  And with that I mean it's decent... I remember this game getting a bit of attention on release. Some raising questions if Steam was going too far and whatnot. I picked it up half in protest against people make too big of a problem out of things. It's of course based on culture that's going to be foreign to alot of people, maybe even some that are warming up to anime.  It's maybe hard to take anything serious here, but I'm still going to be fair. Visual Novels are games I've become quite fond of. They don't give much gameplay but I find it nice to follow a story where you can sometimes choose your path, which also creates some replayability. There's the first problem. Sakura Spirit has only one choice near the ending and it really makes no difference. The story is really basic, as is the narrative and alot of the design choices. As far as the lewd elements go? I think they're fairly innocent. I know that sounds perhaps weird I'm saying that, but really, it's not too bad. There's of course that demon lady that's dressed rather kinky, but that's something you get used to just being there. Honestly, I think we saw more perverted stuff in Saint's Row: The Third.  So since it's gonna be alot of reading (about 4 hours of it, give or take) it's important it's written well. Here I again have to say it's decent at best. There's alot of text that's basically just rephrasing.  There's though some good dialogue at times that can actually get a good laugh, so it doesn't just rely on typical anime shenanigans to get to your funny-bone, whenever it's not trying to get to... nevermind. So yeah, some surprisingly decent humor. Some charisma in the dialogue. More than expected.  There's really not that much to come after here though. It's kinda bare bones in many aspects.  I found it ok at best, but I think it does require some taste for this sort of thing. Perhaps decent if it's your sort of thing, but if you're in any doubt that this is for you, then it's not for you. With this said, it's hard to recommend this to anyone.  (All puns intended!)",

This is just a visual novel and that's it. You'd probably get more interaction from a pop-up book.  The girls have the stereotypical anime personality you find in any bland as heck story. There just wasn't anything to these characters to make me really care about them or their problems.  Also, an odd thing, these girls keep throwing themselves at the main character all half-naked but then they get embarrased if the main character accidentally walks in on them dressing. Its like, really? Now you act with modesty? You weren't all, 'Ooh! Don't look!', when you shoved those giant beanbags into the main character's face or stripped right in front of him. Yes, one of them just ups and starts stripping in front of the main character.   Truthfully, this is my first visual novel type game with sexual overtones in it so maybe that stuff is suppose to be normal. But to me, it just makes the girls all a bunch of stupid air heads.",

The story is also fairly short, taking only about two hours to finish.  The art, I thought, was pretty good. I liked most of the character models, however their personalities were severely lacking. It  is  possible for characters in 'adult games' to be  both  erotic  and  interesting. The music and sound effects were also nothing special.  This game almost turned me off visual novels completely, but luckily I decided to give it another try with the excellent Eden*, which made me realize that Sakura Spirit is just not a very good visual novel.  If you, like me, decide to try Sakura Spirit as your first visual novel - don't. Instead, I recommend Eden*. It costs a bit more, but it is definitely worth it. If you just want to see some anime girls without clothes/covered in goo, then get Sakura Spirit - but wait for it to go on sale.  Review:  eden* ",

Like, I'm not gonna slam it for the lack of adult content, I get that's how they do things on Steam and besides, ain't nothing wrong with a clean VN. I just wish . . . something had happened. Something, anything worth remembering. It was an utterly bland and formulaic experience, carefully crafted to emulate the style of hundreds of VNs and anime before it without any understanding of its place in the canon. I understand that cliches are popular for a reason, and productions laden down with dozens of them are not necessarily bad, but Sakura Spirit just piles them on because it can. Oh no, the village is being attacked by some sort of slime monster! Let's have it pin down one of the heroines and melt her clothes in the name of fanservice. Honestly, that's the only vaguely memorable scene from the entire game (if only due to how incredibly banal it was), aside from a certain . . . chocolatey experience.  However, credit where credit is due. Art is nice and clean, girls are cute, fanservice does its job admirably and the music is fairly decent. Some of the English is a little wonky but on the whole, a fairly polished effort - which I would expect, given the dearth of actual content involved. 2.2 hours was enough to read through this VN at a fairly relaxed pace, including all possible branches in the storyline (spoiler: there's hardly any). As such, I cannot in good conscience recommend this as a visual novel, unless you have a craving for fox girls that no amount of tumblring can fill.",

IAt $10, it seems like a steal, but I had bought the game at $3...and still feel like it should have been worth half that price.  The story is enjoyable. Light-hearted...and the antics the girls get into is humorous and cute. The characters all have their own individual personality, but towards the latter half of the story, they all start acting too similar when their interest in the main character starts showing. The length...does leave much to be desired. It throws several plot points that seemed like it would be explored, but the story just veered off and never really returned to what could have been a big plus. Seriously, the story ends...and I was seriously asking, 'what happened with [insert every drama point mentioned in story here]?!' Also, I had to question why we were even allowed to save so many different files. It was as if the story had branching paths...or flags...but there was none. I think...no...I'm pretty sure there was none.  ...oh, and spelling errors...very minor, so I won't count that as a game breaker...  Overall, the game has a nice light-hearted story, but it's short length and lack of plot exploration hit it hard (why give a save option?!). If anything, it is the very bare of bare bones. So bare...so so bare...  If your into a short, light-hearted story...go for it...just make sure it's at a very cheap price. If you already have delved into the world of visual novels...you might want to pass on this one.",

While he is living his normal life, he decides to pray at a temple, in which he is teleported magically into a different dimension. In this other dimmension, he meets encounters the 4 main female protagonists, Meiko, Miyo, Machiko and Narumi. All other adventures and events basically happen within this other dimension with any of the 4 girls.  I personally find this game alright but slightly lacking; the storyline is creative but very scripted, you only get to make one choice near the end of the game which doesn't affect the end result at all. You also don't get the choice to choose between which of the 4 girls you'd like to focus on, I personally would have enjoyed the game more had it allowed for a more customized experience in which we could focus on developing a relationship with a certain character.  The characters have pretty generic and similar characteristics, Narumi and Meiko are basically the followers of Miyo and Machiko respectively, Narumi and Meiyo are more childish and look up to Miyo and Machiko as their mentors. Miyo on the other hand, is different from the other characters since she is a Tsundere; however the only 'dere' part shown during the entire game was basically when she was caught unclothed.  I have a few problems with the characters too, the main character probably isn't as healthy as you'd think he was, he's been pinned down in so many situations which he could've made a move.. yet he didn't? I get it if the creators of the game were trying to keep this -18 but it still kinda disturbs me..  Miyo the Tsundere Tyrant too, for some reason she thinks it's embarressing for girls to see her naked while openly allowing and even ASKING the main character to look at her breasts!? I don't.. I can't.. even finish this sentence.  Anyways, if you're willing to fish out a few bucks for some bear/not even ecchi/fanservice go ahead. Most people would probably actually buy the game for the fanservice anyways. I warn you though, there's a lot more text than there are photos, so you'll be skipping majority of the game.",

The second tag...implies a game, in my eyes, which this is certainly not. I went into it expecting an old school dating sim, time management, relationship building, blah blah...  TL;DR - If you like reading...hell even then I'd suggest skipping this and going to a book store. If you are expecting an actual Game, move along, this is not the game you are looking for.",

The former is probably one of the best games I've ever played.

There isn't a yellow one.), and the ending is... well, I'm expecting DLC. Which I won't be paying for.  Seriously, save yourself some time. Get Katawa Shoujo. It's amazing.",

WARNING: This game will use 100% of your GPU and is recommended that you have a very good dedicated graphics card. In fact, my Nvdia GeForce Titan wasn't enough to run this game at its full potential. I had to run to my local best buy and buy 2 more models for this game to run completely smooth. Continuing on about the game, the most fun I had was at the Battle Arena. The Battle Arena was a very nice edition added to this game letting you continue your save game fighting hoards of big titted bats. After an additional 14+ hours spent there, I started a new game+, a feature that was very handy and helped me play the game again in ease. I've spent quite a bit of time on this game and I can say that I would def. recommend this game to a friend.

But you can get wank material for free on the internet so this game didn't need it.  STORY: Very thin of a story to keep you going. No one really asks what's happening (especially the MC) aside Tsu's explanation of how some of them got there. That kinda blows 'cause this game gave me more questions than it did answers. Making the game longer to flesh out the world and a more engaging story could have helped.  CHARACTERS: This is probably my biggest gripe with this game. They came off as very flat/trope-y. With the game only taking me just over an hour to beat it explains why I don't care for these characters. They spend too much time doing fanservice for the faceless MC and not anough time to actually let us get to know them. I can't even really give a personality description for the 4 main girls because they came off as the same aside one or two teeny tiny things. Like I said in the STORY section, making the game longer and making more scenes where the girls aren't flashing butt and clevage could have made me like them.  MUSIC: Don't have much to say here, sometimes it came off as typical chinese/japanese music but some tracks stood out to me. Overall, not too bad.  ART: My 2nd biggest gripe. For the most part it looks really good (especially those backgrounds, I want to touch them), but the character sprites rub me the wrong way sometimes. With all the shiny bits on their bodies I wonder if they spend their mornings bathing in oil. I like the details on the sprites at least. I like it when Visual Novels have more detailed-looking characters. I have no comment on the CG's. I don't much care for wank material.    FINAL WORDS: Had the game been longer and the characters and world fleshed out along with it, I could have easily liked this Visual Novel. Maybe Nitro+Chiral and Cheritz has spoiled me, but they also show me that VN's can be amazing things. I suppose the words I could use are 'Incredibly Disappointing'. The climax was hardly even a thing, ending within seconds and leaving an empty feeling. Maybe Pyrite Heart will be better, but I hope there will be something better in the future.",

Only one choice very near the ending and a completetly unremarkable story and plot are what I  believe to be the biggest drawbacks. That and the favoring of boobs over ♥♥♥. Foxgirls do help  sort of make up for that. Seriously though, I can't recommend you get this.  The writing is difficult to follow, especially between speech and thoughts, and not great in general. The characters aren't very well developed and the story is forgettable and very short. The fact it exists on Steam is cool though.",

Full Review:   Wow I really didn't realize I spent 3 hours in a row reading it.  So... out of recomendation (and a random urge to see how 'visual novels' were like), I grabbed this game on a sale. What do I think about it, you ask?  It was well worth the $3. Possibly even $6 or $7 if you really enjoy visual novels. It would of been nice for it to be longer, but the story leaves off at a pretty good point.   So about the tags the community put on this one...    Is it anime?  Oh kawaii desu Yes.   Is it a Visual Novel?  Considering I did mostly reading aside from like one decision... Yeah it's a book with pictures.   Did it contain Nudity?  Umm... Not really. The text, situations, and even imagery certainly rode the borderline of stimulating. But I wouldn't call it Nudity... It was more like Ecchi. It gave hints of things being there, but would never really show anything.   Is it actually Mature?  I would say so. At the  very  least it'd be a 'T for Teen rated' game cause of sexually suggestive content.   Is it a dating sim?  No. A dating sim would be something you take part in to reach a desired ending. This is a story.",
