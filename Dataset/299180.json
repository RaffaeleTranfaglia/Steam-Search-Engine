            "review_text": "Once again, I wish Steam had a 'Maybe' option.  Very basic HOG. No real story line. No puzzles. Just variations of HO scenes. Standard list of objects to find, find the outline of the object, eliminate objects to find the one you want, find hidden letters to spell out the hidden objects, and the most annoying one of all ... find the object based on riddle clues. The whole premise of the game is it's a game show. You spin a wheel that randomly selects what type of HOG scene you get, but that's where it gets really annoying. It's possible to keep getting the same types of scenes over and over depending on where the wheel lands. You can earn skip tokens, to skip the ones that annoy you, but it really doesn't matter, because the wheel only selects the first game you play, and then that's followed by two more random scenes chosen by the host. I hated the riddle scenes, I opted to skip them, I played a different scene, and then the host decides he wants to give me riddle scenes! As the game progresses, you unlock more types of HO scenes, but there's no real sense of progress, it's just scene after scene after scene. Overall ... this game is old fashioned HO. No bells or whistles, just pure HO ... and if that's what you are looking for, it's fine. The genre has moved on from this to bigger and better things, and if you are used to playing newer 'adventure' HOGs, you will probably want to avoid this one. It's basic, it'll scratch your HO itch for a few minutes, and then it starts to get uncomfortable. If you must, try to pick it up on a sale.",

            "review_text": "a great idea for an HOG which gets boring and repetitive very quickly.  pros. the idea of the game no walking around collecting stuff etc. good graphics. many game modes.   cons. boring story, very repetitive always have to do the same stuff in the same scenes   i do not recommend this game at all. maybe only for those who are curious and/or collectors.  overall i give the game 2/10 for the idea and the decent graphics.",

            "review_text": "All in all I like this title. It is based on a concept that you are playing a gameshow and trying to rescue previous contestants that lost but it isn't a strong story line that keep pulling me back into the game.  What does keep pulling me back into it are the new ideas Gogii added to the Hidden Object game genre. Like I said this isn't a strong story driven game much like Artifex Mundi games BUT it does add many new concepts when looking at the same scene; match 3 (adds an extra 2 items somewhere), find 10 like items (adds another 9 items to the scene); Find Alphabet Letters to spell words of objects you must find; Riddle (you need to decipher a sentence to know what to search for), Puzzle (yes puzzle pieces that make up the scene), Combine (kind of deciper an easy meaning that translates to 2 items in the scene), List &amp; Sillouette to name most of them but not all of the modes. There are 12 modes. Also as you play, you get a chance to play 15 second bonus games that let you earn hints, unlocks (to unlock a new mode) &amp; skips (if you didn't like a particular mode). Going back to comparing Artifex Mundi, there isn't any map to this game. It is mainly a game show theme much like 'Discovery! Seek and Find' where the scenes change and not your position on a map. (Thus you don't need to remember where to use an object because you don't pick up any objects to carry around.)  The scenes keep changing rapidly so you don't feel any staleness in looking at scenes or for objects. I also find this game moderately hard to find objects and I've needed to use hints.  If you like HO games and you want to try something different in the HO genre, I'd suggest trying this game out.",
