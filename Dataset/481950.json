            "review_text": "Short but interesting/moving little visual novel, telling the persoanl story of a family and those they meet, during a time of trouble. The nature/causes/politics of the troubles are not discussed as the narrative is very tightly focussed on a very small number of characters. There are number of branching possibilities which occur based on your narrative choices. Some seem a little arbitrary and there isn't always an obvious causal link but the game is so short, it's easy to get all the endings through trial and error. The art style is appealing, though some assets, primarily the non-central characters, are reused with differing shading/colouration. That isn't surprising though, given that the game was made in 4 days. All in all, it's a nice little VN, telling an important story for a good cause. I'm yet to play the other games in the compilation, but this one is a very nice start. Recommended.",
