            "review_text": "Update: It appears that Starbreeze has purchased all the rights to their game and they are doing away with paid drills. This is a step in the right direction, but in my opinion there are still a lot of wrongs that need to be righted before I can recommend the game.  Original Review:  My friend, Doctor Insano, said it better than I could...  So here's the thing. I have 2,000 hours in this game. I have a Youtube channel of me doing Death Wish heists solo without bots. I did the Tabula Rasa challenge solo without bots, unmodded weapons, before Grinder. You could say I loved this game at one point.  That time is gone. Overkill has repeatedly broken promises. They directly said before release 'We will not ever have microtransactions.' And yesterday, October 15, 2015, they added Microtransactions. This game is not Free to Play with microtransactions. This game is not cheap with microtransactions. This game has a reasonably priced base game with $100 of DLC. In order to purchase this game with all DLC, you must pay $130 outside of a sale. On top of this $130 price tag are microtransactions. Just...think about that. The price of this game alone is more than the price of two AAA games. Overkill then has the audacity to TRIPLE DIP on this by adding microtransactions.  Last year, there were a series of 'what's next' audio files hinting at something. After a *month* of daily audio files being released, it culminated in an advertisement for another game that isn't released until 2016 and an in-game baseball bat.  Last year, we had 'Crimefest,' where the top reward Overkill was to release was a mystery. This mystery ended up being John Wick. A movie tie-in they were going to make and release anyway.  Last year, some of the rewards for Crimefest were 'FBI Files' (in-game stats), and a new enemy. These weren't released until this year. The FBI files ended up being a re-implementation of a community web page, and the new enemy ended up just being a bunch of shields standing in a circle.  This year, Overkill did a 'Hype Train' event. By pre-ordering DLC, we would get 'hype-fuel' points. With enough 'hype-fuel,' rewards for the community would be unlocked. In order to boost sales, Overkill finally delivered on a promise of finishing their new prestige levels (called Infamy). The first five infamy levels provided very small gameplay benefits along with awesome in-game masks. The next 20 levels released in Infamy 2.0 provided new masks and experience point bonuses (so you can infamy....faster?). I call this 'Mask Pack 2.0.' It took Overkill 14 months to release this. In response, people started refunding their DLC pre-orders. In response to THAT, Overkill released the DLC early so no one could get refunds. The latest Hype-train reward has yet to be released. In response to this, I completely stopped buying DLC. I have no DLC at all that has been released since Mask Pack 2.0.  And most recently, Overkill added microtransactions after explicitly saying that they will NEVER do that along with intentionally breaking extremely well made community mods. Overkill does not deserve your money. They do not deserve any money. They have repeatedly broken their promises to the community. They have insulted the community. They have done absolutely nothing but show how far a company can fall.  Overkill, shame on you. I truly do not believe there are words that can describe my level of disappointment with you. Am I angry? You bet your ♥♥♥ I am. But more than that, I'm just so disappointed. You've truly shown that you are nothing but liars and cheats. I truly hope your company goes out of business.",

The gunplay is nice, the skills give tons of different playstyles, the heists are enjoyable, and the music is amazing. I would completely recommend this game to anyone if it was made by a different developer. Sadly, it's made by Overkill.  See, Overkill is known for keeping in touch with their community. And that's not a bad thing; it's great, actually. If they actually ♥♥♥♥ing listened to their community, that is, instead of just pretending to give a ♥♥♥♥ about the people that play it. Overkill loves money, never forget it. They release tons of DLC, did a whole 'completely free event' back in the Spring where you had to buy DLC to unlock more rewards, and now did another 'completely free event' where on the first day microtransactions are added that give stat boosts.  Now, whether or not you consider this Pay 2 Win or not is your opinion, as it is a coop game. But it's still ♥♥♥♥ing slimy to promise your community a completely free event, have them work hard to get all the rewards, then day ♥♥♥♥ing one release a macrotransaction system which gives stat boosts.  This is a great game. It was made by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer. If you want to still spend your money on it, go ahead, but be ready to feel like ♥♥♥♥ when Overkill once again manages to ♥♥♥♥ over their community for that cash.",

            "review_text": "I've been playing this game since its beta, back then, the game used to have a lot of potential, It was a game I was excited for back in 2013. When Payday 2 was finally released, it was a broken, unpolished piece of software, the base content was alarmingly low and some of features announced before its release were nowhere to be found. However, the gunplay was a blast and the addition of skilltrees, mask/weapon customization and the card drop system kept the game interesting despite its lack of levels. At this date, the base game offers an acceptable amount of content for its price but still remain broken and unpolished.  I would actually recommend the game if it wasn't for Overkill's behavior these past years.  Of course there are the sheer amount overpriced DLCs and the microtransactions but that's only the tip of the iceberg.  Back in 2014, Overkill hosted the first community event known as the Crimefest, where the community could be awarded free stuff by joining the community group.  Reaching 3 millions members would unlock a the last reward which was a secret at the time. Unsurprisingly, the community thought that this last secret reward was going to be something awesome, so they started to gather everyone they could in order to reach that 3 Millions member mark. And then Overkill ruined everything when they revealed that the secret reward was the fact that they were going to use those 3 Millions of people to advertise a movie and later on the AlienWare Alpha and their own VR Googles and if you leave the group to avoid that kind of advertisement, you can kiss all the the free content released after the event goodbye. Not to mention some of the rewards unlocked were post-poned and released roughly one year later during the second Crimefest.  A couple of month after that event, Overkill released 2 DLCs on the same day which started the trend of putting 2 DLCs on the storefront instead of regrouping all the extra content they made for Payday 2 into one single DLC in an attempt to squeeze as much money as they can from their playerbase.   Then we got the second community event : The Hypetrain which is a Crimefest where the 'free' rewards are unlocked with a set amount of hypefuel that can only be obtained by buying DLCs on the store. Two DLCs were introduced : The Overkill Pack and the Completely Overkill pack which were not related in any way as their name would suggest (The first being a simple weapon pack and the later being a 25$ 'support' with 4 masks and a weapon skin 'crafted with love and care [...] A true Payday collectible'). I suppose Overkill thought it would be hilarious to confuse everyone.  But this wasn't enough for Overkill, all the money they were already making wasn't even close to enough. Fast foward to the Road to Crimefest ; the third community event, Overkill came up with the neat idea of giving the community actual in-game challenges that would unlock the rewards upon completion. Once again, the community worked hard to overcome all the challenges and managed to unlock the final reward. And then Overkill once again ruined everything when they revealed that the final reward was in fact a microtransactions system à la CS:GO. 'But it is not that bad because CS:GO and TF2 does the same thing and get away with it... Right?' Well, not really, TF2 is a Free-to-play where that kind of business model is expected while CS:GO may be a pay-to-play game but is updated on a regular basis and all the content added to the game beside weapon skins is free of charge.  Meanwhile Payday 2 is not free-to-play, has those kind of microtransactions, is updated on a regular basis but the content added to the game may be paid DLCs. The microtransactions are there just to, again, squeeze as much money from the playerbase rather than support the developement of the game itself.  I cannot think about this game without having a bitter taste in my mouth, Payday 2 could have been something much greater than a money extracting billboard meme-shooter if it wasn't for Overkill greed.  The game is still great but Overkill is ruining it. Since all the money they are already making through microtransactions and DLC sales will never be enough, they will probably come up with something even more disgusting than the introduction of microtransactions in the future.",

I might not have alot of hours put into the games, but it was a nice game to get back on once in a while and Crimefest was the perfect opportunity to get back in now.  After seeing the First Day Update of skins that BOOST stats of the weapons and the gambling mechanic, which costs as much as a key in TF2 or CS:GO, i deinstalled and im never going to look back.

For me it is too much, I never thinked of Payday 2 as a realistic game, but there is a differencce between unrealistic and completely dumb ! If you want to release more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cross-over in the future at least dont ask 7.79 $ for it !!!  I wont pay for that DLC, and I uninstalled Payday 2, and wont re-install it unless OVK change their way!   Payday 2 is a great game but, greedy developement have destroyed it ! Overkill is laughing at it's player base trying to milk all the money they can from it ! IF you dont have time to patch bugs, how can you have time to realease that BS ???  2 of the special enemy in the game are broken ! Tazer can taze you without line of sight ! Cloaker can cloak tought wall ! But, no time to fix special enemy !  The so called Re-balance, Overkill tried to balance weapon during crimefest, now we have handgun hitting harder than shotgun and assault rifle! Its been more than 2 months and nothing has been made about this!   The perk deck are currently un-balanced, some are not even usable on Deathwish! Overkill said they were balancing the game around the base content ! Armorer is one of the base perk deck and it's worthless! Infiltrator and Grinder are great for DW but guess what, they both come with DLC !  After one year working on a new enemy! They released Captain winters ! The captain arrive on the map, stop moving, and lock the wave!( you have to defeat him for the police assault to stop) He is surrounded by other shield! And guess what ? The best way to defeat him is Molotov Cocktail(BBQ pack DLC). But they are balancing the game around base content....  Overkill said that after crimefest they would be more transparent...But ..... They said they would listen to the community too! Oh yeah Almir now create thread in the forum ! Then drop a couple of ;) in the comment, that's listeneing to the community !!   I used to buy every DLC at he moment they were relased, I would have buyed any full priced game from overkill, Would have pre-ordered it! But with the way they are taking now I wont buy anything from them at full price !!  GG overkill !!! You can now rename your game for: PAY-2-WIN-DAY !  Posted: 15 Oct, 2015 @ 7:38pm  Updated: 21 Oct, 2015 @ 1:04pm  Overkill are still liar they lied about MC and a lot of other thiings! They took the first step in the right direction at day 6 of crimefest by making drill dropable by card drop!  This is not enough yet ! Now safe and drill can be dropped in-game, but we have no idea of the drop rate of the drill. Overkill still have a lot to do, and to learn!  I dont think they will continue in the right direction...",

Is it worth it to lose all of our cash when we reluctantly kept buying your DLC ♥♥♥♥♥torms?   Rant ahead.   This game used to be pretty amazing when it first came out. Sure, it didn't had much content, but it was still fun. Updates were frequent and most of them were free, with new heists and stuff like that. Then, the DLC ♥♥♥♥ storm came. A gun pack here. Another gun pack over there, a new paid heist here. That was decent. I mean, the first KF had gun packs. If you don't count re-skins...Just 3 of them. This one? A ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ TON. Most of them include gimmicky weapons that aren't really that useful in game, like fire weapons, and guns that you'll never use, just for the sake of curiosity. Tons of lore unfriendly characters, that felt like somebody keeps adding their Original characters (Do not steal), messing up with the lore and history of the characters by forcefully inserting new acquaintances that were never before seen. And what's worse, this game is pretty much a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥ now. It ♥♥♥♥♥s itself for cash and keeps doing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crossovers that are lackluster at best, atrocious at worst. I mean, I was okay with having ♥♥♥♥ing Keanu Reeves in game, but then after a while, came the whole ♥♥♥♥ING STUPID Goat Sim crossover that makes me want to kill myself. The problem is, lots of these DLCs come out once or twice per month, and they are obviously rushed. In true Overkill fashion, these DLC packs, heists, and weapons often come INFESTED with bugs, sometimes even game breaking.   Well, we still had plenty of DLC shoved up our asses and stuff, it's...Okay...And then...  The major ♥♥♥♥♥torm came.....  Overkill decided to add microtransactions in game. After they said years ago that they wouldn't, 'Shame on us' if we thought otherwise. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon skins (Because now what CSGO did is going to haunt us all, right? Because it makes more dosh?). The worst part is, they actually changed stats on the weapons. They had stat boosts. That's right, the game became pay to win for a bit. Overkill tried to save their asses from the ♥♥♥♥♥torm of biblical proprtions that almost ravaged them, and they can't get rid of the hatred they earned even to this day. First, 'Oh wait guys! We'll actually give each of you a free skin! Heh, that's what you want, right?'  Then, they got rid of the stats (I think)  TL;DR  This game is still the cheap ♥♥♥♥♥ that does crossovers with everybody, the skins are still there, and you'll get ♥♥♥♥ tons of overpriced, buggy, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC on a monthly basis. Do not bother with this game. It used to be pretty cool, but those days are long gone. I enjoyed this game. It's a shame that it had to die in such a long, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way. Do not support these scummy developers, get another game.",

            "review_text": "Let me just quickly list off the things that ruined this game for me personally, and that anyone who might be interested in purchasing this game should know before buying. I do not make this review lightly, and I myself have played the game thoroughly. I however cannot forgive some of this game's faults. They are the following:  -Terrible money-grab DLC's. The gage shotgun pack is perhaps the worst here, and in my opinion the courier pack is perhaps the best (simply due to the fact that you now have some slight control over what gun attachments you are getting). But to pay $5+ to recieve a few specific guns only to have all of the modifications locked behind impossible to get achievements is ridiculous. For example, 'Unusual Suspects' in the Watchdogs job, you have to complete the mission with four different friends all wearing different DLC masks. This is an obvious ploy to convince your friends to waste their money on the DLC as well so you can get the mods the achievement unlocks. While you are not necessarily forced to buy the dlc content, the game does get dull after a while, and the presence of all the DLC makes it all the more obvious that if you want a few more hours of gameplay out of this game the devs are going to milk you for all it's worth and then some.  -Mob spam. What's that? You crave more difficulty? Instead of perhaps, improving the AI, allow us to instead drown you in a sea of tasers and shields to create the illusion of difficulty!  -Specials are ridiculous. Shields are perhaps the most annoying considering they trace your exact movement to the point that they will clip the shield through their body to block you. Don't expect to be able to shoot their hands or feet either. Tasers have a tendency to hit you through cars, and they have almost no cooldown from what I can tell. Cloakers, clearly equiped in light armor, can take up to 3 shotgun shells to the face before finally dying. I'd say the only thing done right are the bulldozers.  -There are no real tactics once you've gone loud. Expect to everyone to just run around the map. You honestly can't completely hold a position or a room due to the AI's instict of simply walking right up to you (or THROUGH you). Your team full of random people will most likely just be wandering the map doing their own thing unless it's strictly stealth. AI can hardly use cover. The game will basically zerg you to death.  -This game uses card draw at the end of every heist to determine if you get a mask, a mod, a pattern (for mask), instant cash, or a colorscheme (for pattern). Cards tend to get very repetitive very fast. This alone would be fine, but the game has a way of punishing you for trying to farm these cards by debuffing your experience points (The largest exp reduction I have recieved was -15%, which is quite significant on Overkill). You will undoubtedly reach a point in the game where you have more money than actual stuff to buy.  -AI teammates are the definition of useless. They cannot grab bags, they will not restart drills, and hell-- they can't even shoot straight. Basically the only thing you'll be doing by having AI teammates is giving yourself a couple of bullet sponges while you do all the actual work. They also have really bad judgement over weather to shoot the enemy or revive you, so expect the AI to do neither effectively.  -No system for migrating hosts. Doesn't matter how long you've spent on a heist, if the player who started the lobby disconnects, all of your time has essentially just been wasted. This is a giant problem.  -Game will randomly go out of sync. AI can be random places compared to other people's game. It gets especially confusing when AI flip a switch when in your view they are on the other side of a wall.  - Finally, pay and experience don't really seem to correlate with mission difficulty. Some missions just aren't worth doing unless you're going for either variety or a skull mask.  All-in-all, the game is definitely bearable, but having steam friends who play the game aswell was pretty much the only reason for the amount of hours I've poured into this game. These things I have listed are simply what finally drove me away from the game.   (Also, anyone who feels so inclined as to try to give me tips on how to play the game, don't bother. I've logged over 200 hours into this game. I've figured everything out, there is really nothing you could possibly inform me of that I don't already know. If you have any objections as to the things I have stated I will revise this review accordingly.)",

            "review_text": "I have 300 hours in this game, I've done every mission. I've completed almost every mission on the hardest difficulty, the only ones remaining being the most recent paid-DLC missions that they added when I stopped playing this game. I've got to V-100 (Max level, max prestige) legitimately. This game is decent but it has far too many problems.   Firstly, playing with friends is a blast. Get together with 3 other people and rob a bank, diamond store, etc. Go in stealthily, silently take out guards in an empty corridor or just swagger in while putting a mask over your face and holding a shotgun. That stuff is great at first. If you're an experienced player and friends are new to the game -- Let them host the game and pick the missions. I see too many people catapulting their friends through the levels by doing max difficulty multi-day heists. A natural progression is much more enjoyable for everyone.  On to the problems:  1) Stealth is broken.   A core gameplay mechanic outright doesn't work. In order to stealth consistently you need to use light armour (or a suit) and low profile weapons. If the alarm gets raised, stealth is gone and you need to complete the mission 'loud'. Good luck taking out juggernauts in bomb disposal suits, and 100 assorted law enforcement personnel with your silenced handgun and a suit. It's not realisitically going to happen unless you're already ready to escape.  Secondly, stealth is actually broken. Without talking about desync issues in MP (yet): guards will walk through walls, spot you through walls, spot a broken window through 4 walls whilst being at the other side of a building, etc. This breaks stealth and you need to complete the mission loud (as described above). There is no reason for it, it just happens. There is no counterplay or skill-based way of avoiding it, the game will decide at random intervals whether you fail the mission right then for no reason whatsoever.  Thirdly, for balance reasons you get a limited number of cable ties to take hostages. This stops them calling the cops, running away (alerting other civilians, etc). You can also use an ECM jammer, a temporary device that stops people calling police and/or jams cameras. It gives you time to destroy cameras, take hostages, etc. It would be great if it worked consistently: Civilians are randomly able to trigger the alarm while it's up (it's not intended). Yet another feature of the game that will instantly fail a mission because of a bug.  Lastly, certain stealthable missions ('Big oil' being the main example) have broken hivemind AI. If one NPC sees you, every NPC in the map immediately becomes alerted and knows your exact position, will raise the alarm, etc. Stealth is a puzzle game with a little bit of RNG. Once you figure out how to stealth a mission, it's solved.  2) MP is broken  Multiplayer is broken in many, many ways. It's P2P (which I'm fine with for this format of game). There are random connection problems, sometimes a certain friend can't join you but you can join them; then another friend is able to join you but not them. Other times it will work just fine.  Privacy settings are broken. If you make a public lobby it's usually public, but not always. If you make a private lobby, it's sometimes public. 'Friend-only' is Friends and friends-of-friends to the infinite degree (but only one at once). A friend can join you and while they are in the game, their friend 'X' can join your games; the original friend is free to leave then. Then any friend of 'X' can also join, and so on.  Bottom line: They are visibility settings, not restrictions . There are big problems with doing it that way.  Hackers are abundant. There are some very basic anti-cheat methods in the game. They don't actually stop people cheating, instead it marks that player as a cheater for everyone in the game. The cheating isn't so much of an issue -- you can host your own lobby if your connection is stable enough or you can just leave an find another lobby (or play with friends!). The bigger issue is 3rd party services (pd2stats) that will check your profile to see if you're cheating. No problem, apart from if you have a private profile on steam you'll be kicked from every public lobby. This is indirectly the fault of the game, the community has been driven to inaccurate methods of detecting people cheating because the game offers basically nothing. Not to mention that those sites will randomly mark you as a hacker for a variety of reasons. If you're max level, prepare to be kicked from every game too: people would rather just kick you than risk playing with a hacker.  Sync is broken. Physicals aren't synced, they're all client-side. This is espeically a problem with ragdolls. So enemy positions aren't synced but detection is done on the host. It leads to many things like getting spotted through a wall (NB: This can happen in SP because of a bug anyway). If you shoot a guard, he'll die where he actually is -- not for you though. So that guard who's in a corridor, but actually in the middle of room: Don't shoot him. He'll die in a room full of people and you'll fail. Of course you'll see the corpse in the corridor with no way for anyone to see them, but 3 other people in the game will shout at you for it. So you decide to wait an extra second or two to counteract it (taking into account you may got spotted too!) and you may think you've worked around the issue (nope!). Ragdolls are client-side: The body can ragdoll anywhere on the host and get the alarm triggered. Sometimes the physics can break and you can't answer the guard's pager (required!) and so you fail. That's a fourth distinct way of just failing a mission that's completely out of your control.  3) Items are RNG, missions are a grind, difficulty increases  So you can buy guns, great! Oh, you need an RNG drop to unlock the silencer. When it comes to stealth or max difficulty missions, you need the right loadout from RNG drops. By max level (without prestige) you'll have almost everything you'll need for a lot of missions (But not the perfect gear).  Unlocking skills costs money. You get money by doing missions (hurrah!) but you'll quickly find at lower levels that you level up faster than accumulating the required money to actually utilize your level. Don't think about unlocking guns at the same time either.  There aren't many different missions. There's quite a few at first, but many of them are pointless after a while. The 'lower level' missions give very little EXP or money regardless of difficulty. They aren't much easier on the hardest difficulties compared to other missions and in some cases can take longer. It forces you into grinding the same missions over and over. The devs have done a decent job recently in balancing the amounts of EXP and cash earned but it's just not enough.  Newer (DLC, free or paid) missions are more difficult than the previous missions. That's cool since it gives a new challenge. Oh? They improved the AI too! Cool. Wow, this is hard and I'm going to enjoy it when I finall-- wait, why is that guy mowing through everything it takes a whole clip to the face for me to kill it. 'lol these new weapons are great' -- Weapons from paid DLC.  4) Free content is 'community DLC'  It's not 'free DLC', it's 'community DLC' which is free. All you need to do is to join the steam group for the game and you unlock it. New weapons, missions. It's cool until you disagree with a dev and they can decide to ban you from the group. GUIZE WE BAN HACKERZ ND DEY CNT GET FREE STUFFZ! (except of course, they can).  Closing: I'm out of characters (there's a limit!). There are so many things broken about this game and I can't list them all. It's fun with friends but it's buggy in many ways. Devs blaming crashes on 'mods' or hardware or software issues on your end doesn't help either.",

Payday 2 almost always descends into Killing Floor style holding out, and Killing Floor does it better. The 'tons of guns' available are mostly useless, which means you'll be using the same load out over and over again, there isn't much variety of enemies, and almost no variation between playthroughs of each mission. Add this to the microscopic maps you're playing on, and the whole thing gets pretty stale fast.  And, let's be honest, the way they're rolling out DLC is just slimey.

Almir, the head of the company, did an AMA on Reddit, and has outright said that the microtransactions will not be removed, that the stat bonuses from skins will not be removed, and that everything is going great on their end. He says that the only people upset are a very vocal minority.  I've already bought this game. I've already bought a lot of the DLC (most of it). But I won't be buying any more games from Overkill. Almir wants to present Overkill as a tiny independent dev company, and this is not the case. Almir wants to pretend that the community was happy to have the safes, the crappy skins, and the stat bonuses, and we are not. Almir wants to pretend like Overkill is struggling, and needs the funds from microtransactions to stay afloat, while their parent company's own financial reports (publicly visible, since they are a publicly traded company) prove otherwise. In fact, they show that Payday 2 has been raking in the money.  The blatant lies and disregard for the community shown by Almir, who is apparently acting as their community spokesperson as well, since nobody else has said a word, are rather disappointing. Even more disappointing, since this is, in fact, a great game.  Original: This is a great game, and right now, you should not buy it.  Prior to release, the devs outright said that there would be no microtransactions. Then, on the first day of an event they said would be full of free rewards for the players, after completing a large series of challenges, they added microtransaction safes that give you (awful looking) skins for weapons, along with stat boosts for said weapons.  The endless cycle of DLC was already getting to be a little much, but with blatantly going back on their word, trying to downplay the blowback, and attempting to silence and wait out the anger in their community, I would recommend against this game.  Perhaps if the microtransactions are removed, the safes no longer possible to receive instead of a payout for finishing a mission, some way to earn keys without actually spending money, the stat boosts removed, perhaps then it might be worth picking up again.

The feeling of the thrill of doing a new heist whether it be parachuting from an airplane or simply tying up a hostage is just overwhelming in the beginning. The gunfights are intense and there is a variety of enemies. This all help contribute to the pros of the game. I would give my left nut sack to be able to experience the thrill of doing a single bank heist now. But like all good stories, there comes what I would like to call POINT BREAK.  After POINT BREAK the game seems to be a drag. It loses the element of shock and awe. Sure, all maps are 'randomized' but seriously, they are just small things like security cameras and what not. It's not the same feeling as before. Plus, when your playing co-op online with random teammates, this is the point where you realize that the goal of the game is NOT securing the bags into the escape van but rather running around and trying to get the most kills as possible. After this point, your just constantly farming for exp and trying to get to a new prestige (it's called infamy in the game).   So overall, yea I would say this game is great to play with friends online for a couple of rounds. But it is not a game where you can spend hundred of hours on it.

Your crimefest's completely free updates included the completely paid microtransaction system. 2014 crimefest rewards over a year late. Initial game release promises of safehouse customisation, still unfulfilled. If you want a fun game, where the developers respect their community with honesty and respect. Avoid Payday 2.  I will continue playing. But I will never purchase anymore of your dlc again. You had a good thing going, but you blew it. For Payday 2 and all your future games Overkill. Well done.  Avoid Overkill like the plague my friends. Nothing but lies and deceit await you at the bottom of the pit of dlc and promises.  Edit. So Crimefest is now over. Total look at the event? Well. Half of the rewards were minor patches that most games have in the multiplayer aspect by default (Jumping animations, seriously, it took them THIS long. For jumping animations. My brain can't even handle the sheer...), bug fixes and a wonky weapon rebalance that left pistols removing half your torso whilst a shotgun will give you a haircut and assault rifles becoming more like water pistols. Some free masks, par for the course, random meme masks, not interested.  They did add some heists, but after the release of microtransactions I can only assume that these map releases were planned around the anger from microtransactions and meant to calm the masses. But I should really talk about the game. The maps are, ok. I can't really say anything else about them. First World Bank (FWB) is relativly straightforward, no particularly interesting mechanics or anything new or exciting. Slaughterhouse, ehhh. I've played worse and it seemed ok to me.  Crimefest, honestly, if the microtransactions hadn't been there, I think Overkill would have gotten nothing but praise. But they are. And there's also anger. So. Yeah. Crimefest was like 4/10.  Update 90. Supposedly the update that would please us and make us happy with overkill again. Wrong. More lies from the money grubbing developers. The skins from the Completely Overkill Pack were advertised (let me say that one more time) ADVERTISED to be free of ANY form of boost that would make you better than any player on your team. They have continued to blatently lie and cheat their playerbase and seem hellbent on driving away the players that enabled this game. They gave 7 select dlcs to people that owned the pack. That sounds great right? Wrong. Most people who bought the pack would have already owned said dlcs (myself included), so what did we get? A hot steaming dump courtesy of Almir. We get nothing.

It lacks core content, technically it lacks pretty much everything. Developers on the other hand? Haven't really been doing much, except ripping off modders work.  Now let's see some example.  The game was infested by cheaters / hackers. That's no surprise, but not all hackers are badies. 1) Some of them actually made scripts to make in-game vechiles drivable. Which the developer originally claimed it was impossible due to game engine limit. (Now we have drivable vechiles)  2) Community modders made a katana skin for a melee weapon in game. Months later? Developer added in a 'new' katana weapon, exact same model, with different texture.  3) Community modders made a 3rd party website that allows user to check another user's game statistics. A whole year later? Developer implemented [FBI Files], that does the same damn thing, but with a flashier layout.  These are only a few examples I'm listing, to sum it up. The developers have actually been doing the minimum while flat out ripping off what the community offered themselves. This even include some nastiest bugs and glitches the developer was unabled / refused to fix. It was thanks to the community, that someone wrote a code to fix the issue, THEN later on the developer implemented the user made code into the official build of the game.  But enough of trashing the developers themselves. Let's talk about the game itself.  Game contents? Well... Let's just say, if you aren't planning to buy the Game of The Year, or any DLCs at all. You'd be bored with the game in a rather hasty manner.   People often describe Payday 2's community is toxic. For that I'll have to say. If that's true, then the 'toxic' community and developers deserves each other.  If you manage to get through this review, then props to you. And if you did, yet still decided to buy this game? Well. Just remember,   Steam refund policy is - Within 14 days, under 2 hours of play time.   Good luck, you're gonna need it.",

            "review_text": "This game has more to it than just the average fps, or strategy game. I got no clue where to start, but let's discuss the games -  Graphics: If your computer can hadnle everything on max, it looks really good, they have chosen the right colour palette for each map, but if you run it on minimum, it can be quite annoying to look at from time to time, for example distance animation (turn it down and you get less animation on the police, and civilians in the distance) They tend to have sorta laggy look, which can be really distracting. But overall, if you're 50%+ (It's a bar where you adjust it) then you're going to be fine.  Gameplay: Well it's quite obvious what the game has to offer, 4 masked men with weapons and money, and it's called Payday (2). But it's an awesome game which let you and your team decide wether you want to go loud or stealth. You get an exp bonus for doing stealth (which is not to let anyone inform the police you're there), there's a great varierity on customization for your weaponry, alot of different silencers, and other powerful muzzles, scopes, stocks, sights, everything your heart desires :)   Further interests: You also have a leveling system and 2 money accounts ingame, One being your Spending cash, cash you spend on mask weapons and customizations and more, where you then got your Offshore account, which mainly is being used to buy Infamous (If you reach level 100 you can choose to pay 200M for an infamous level and unlock unique items. I'm level 99 as I write this)   About the leveling system: You got 4 tech trees, or talent trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Technician, Ghost. Mastermind, is kinda the leader, the one who can buy cheaper assets, drop medic bags, and revive you from distance. Enforcer, Brutal shotgun service, with the help and assist of deploying ammo bags for his team. Technician, C4 master, can blast through any common safe or door, which saves 2-8 mins. He also have a disposeable sentry, which however in my opinion isn't worth it. Ghost, the stealther, the one person with ECM (which is a jammer of phone signals and more) He's the invisible one running around and stealing without being seen once.  The Music: Fabulous, flawless, interesting and really well fitting under the assaults! The music tends to change from whenever there's assault or not (which is the intense wave attack of the enforcement if you have alerted them)  I bet there's something I have forgotten to mention, but this is my honest opinion about it so far :) Hope you enjoyed this review.  10/10",

Unfortunately, the devs decided to become greedy, release tons of paid dlc with minimal content, and then release microtransaction items for Crimefest 2015. Microtransactions give players chances for skins with permanent stat boosts.  In the same patch, the devs completely ruined weapon balance. Clearly every pistol in the game should deal 2-3 times as much damage per shot as a shotgun.  Also in the same patch, devs removed the hooks that all of the mods for this game used and ruined any sort of hope for them returning.  I wish I could recieve a refund for this game. It was great while it lasted, but the DLC rates increased while the content of each patch went down. The devs lied time and time again about content and caring for the community. Many items were undelivered on (content for the completely overkill pack) and promises were broken (that the game would never feature microtransactions and that Crimefest content would be free). It is with great shame that I must remove my positive review and replace it with this. I will think twice before supporting Overkill again.

Whether or not you can get the same enjoyment out of it really depends on how often you can play with friends or some random trolls/hackers/people with a good view of their own colon. Recently Overkill decided to mess with what was decent and tried to infuse a little 'George Lucas' into the mix. It went as expected.  If you have a core group of friends who all want to play Payday 2 and can grab it cheap on sale I say go ahead give it a shot otherwise you are probably best left looking elsewhere for your CO-OP gaming experience.

My mentality was don't buy if you don't want it. However, in less than a month I have noticed some very unfair game play. My DLC guns suddenly were very inaccurate and stability became an issue. It got to be to the point that my favorite weapon that I had used for over 450 hours was now useless. I suspect my gun would be 'improved' if I made a microtransaction for a chance at getting a weapon skin and boost.   The skin and boost are all random and so for what I use I could potentially spend hundreds of dollars on getting the ONE skin needed to make my gun work again.   The new update came out and trying to play this game has become frustrating and almost impossible to play. Guards are now teleporting through doors and windows. They are seeing players from all the way on the other side of the map, which is really frustrating when trying to stealth. The lag on the game is horrific and it is almost a relief when the game crashes.   A great game has turned into a pile of poo in less than ONE month and OVERKILL has no plans to address any of these issues.   So to summarize I paid for the game I paid for ALL the DLC's  Now I need to pay for microtransactions to properly use the weapons I already paid for  and the game is unplayable.

I stopped buying dlc and uninstalled the game from my harddrive.  The fanboys mocked me but my decision would appear to have been the correct one.

They even inserted boosts you *buy* instead of *earn* in contrast to their reasoning for not making the infamy update more substantial that it would give an unfair advantage to people who played longer.

A few bits of overpriced DLC here and there, some really stupid balance choices, they brought back cloakers, then they balanced the cloakers better after a few more updates, and then they broke the weapon balance, then they broke the difficulty balance, then they fixed it, then they ♥♥♥♥ed with it, then they fixed it again, etc.   We still loved the game so much so we were fine with it. I may not have played for thousands of hours like some people, but I do still remember the good times I had with this game before updates turned it into something I didn't recognize.

With the safes, it's just like trying to win the lottery, chances are you're more likely to to win the actual lottery than to get a drill to the safes, and even then chances are, you're going to get a weapon skin to a weapon that you don't own (aka DLC weapons).

Now the game has roughly enough content to get you to 70-80 before the game goes full grind. The DLC packs are mostly atrocious cash grabs, funny enough Overkill addressed their loot drop system issues for attachments, now you can earn the attachments by finding packages in heists. How do you find packages? Buy the DLC. Bravo.  Aside from there being some developer issues, the game is improving, new content every month or so, there's going to be updates to fix the absolutely garbage host system (Funny enough, I bet all the people who cried at my suggestion before will now praise it since Overkill is behind it). The community is STILL ♥♥♥♥ing horrible, but I like to think it's slowly getting better. Is it worth a buy now? I suppose, it's still highly reccomended to find friends before getting the game, it took me almost 90 hours before I found anyone who would both continue playing, and not be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bag. The DLC is pretty garbage and a questionable use of developer time with all the other issues the game has.   If you can get over what are the equivalent of the worst of the League/Dota/DayZ communities put together as fanboys on the forum, then there's fun to be had. Just expect some very iffy updates in the future, and get used to some annoying game issues such as RNG based stealth and repeating the same heists over and over for either cards or exp.  ****Old review  Well the game has one of the worst communities of all time. Ranging from fanboys, trolls, hackers, oh my. The content gets incredibly grindy after level 50 with nothing to do but repeat from there on in. Enjoy the random kicks by hosts. There's essentially no anticheat despite the dozens of free hacks on the market. The DLC is pretty overpriced to boot.  If you have three friends to play with then the game is quite good, but that's somewhat limiting. It's kind of sad really, if Overkill kept a tighter grip on the community things would be far improved. Hopefully the updates down the line at least improve the grindy content.",

Solo is not even an option, and playing with strangers was doable but difficult because of coordination problems).  Also, at the time, Overkill was balancing nicely free content and DLCs, which were respectable because adding a good deal of new content for an acceptable price. Although sometimes these updates came with unnecessary nerf, they overall were positive.  Came back this week-end, seeing as how everything was on sale to check the DLCs (I absolutely refuse to pay any DLC more than 2 euros) which could have enticed me to play again.  Then I discovered the story of micro-transactions.  Sooo. I pay the game a first time (ok, its only 20 euros now, but it was 40 euros when published). Then I pay DLCs (even only at discount, its represents 2 times the game price. Without a discount it would be 6 or 7 times).  Then I PAY INSIDE THE GAME JUST TO HAVE A CHANCE TO ENJOY MYSELF?  Screw you hard Overkill. Cupidity is never a smart move, and it's especially stupid when it's that blunt.   TL;DR PayDay 2 was a great game.

In addition, with each DLC release, OVERKILL would introduce some form of power creep to make existing weapons worse and harder to clear originally managable content.   Basicly, they expect you to pay atleast $50 in addition to the base game to experience anything remotely close to the full content. These include weapons and skills that are locked behind dlc and are helpful in tackling the power creep which is very apparent in this game.   Don't forget there are also locked weapons and characters for game promotions. Oh, you don't own Hotline Miami 2? Well then you won't have access to this character, mask, and weapon.   And for the finishing touch, they introduced microtransaction to Payday 2 as of Oct 15. They nerfed many weapons during this update, and the only way you can get stats anywhere close to the guns pre-nerf is to buy 'Drills &amp; Safes' to open and get rare skins.

Since the results are random, you may need to buy extra DLC just to use your newly-purchased skin.  $130. Plus extra for a random chance at stat boosts. The game developers point to TF2 (a free game) and CS:GO (cheap, with NO DLC) as their inspiration. While it's true that you buy a key to open a chest, the similarities end there. The company says they need to make more money since their staff has tripled, but PD2 is also their most successful game of all time. If their most successful game cannot keep itself afloat, should we really throw good money after bad?  (Edit) On the off-chance the developers end this money-grabbing nonsense, here's what I think of the pre-crimefest game. It's a HELL of a lot of fun, difficult (if you want it), slow-paced deliberate stealthing followed by a frenzy of running and emptying every magazine you have as fast as possible...or just go in guns blazing on most heists on most difficulty steeings, if that's your thing. Customization is fun and VARIED, but there are lots of 'required' skill points you MUST use at all times to be a competent character; with no hints about what those might be without looking up third-party guides. The DLC is extensive, and EXPENSIVE if you want it all; but you really don't 'need' any of it. The base game is plenty fun enough.

But just over a week now and I would implore anyone thinking on it to avoid it like a bad omen, just for the fact that you wont support this traitor developers. The devs at Overkill turned into something that goes on par with EA. They straight up lied to us and spit in our faces afterwards, going from a loving dev that worked with the community to make this amazing game and its (mostly) great content, and they turned into greedy sacks of crap and are now in the process of butchering this game.  Now, dirty, untrustworthy devs aside, they put stat modding skins that look REPULSIVE into the game that you can only buy to unlock (because you just arent going to get the drills in a loot drop, face it) and just screwed the weapons balance from before this Black Market update. Nothing is balanced anymore and now gunplay is just...boring. You either have something thats EXTREMELY overpowered, the pistols, or you have a loud BB gun, everything else. There is no more fun or tactics with weapon choosing and loadouts, it is so blatant what is or is not good to bring.   DLC released now is becoming obviously more and more about being quick cash grabs, but at least theres nothing really game changing, yet, but they are becoming less and less unique, fun, and useful, more just for money money money. Everything is in a downward slope and there doesnt appear to be a slowing down or a stopping point soon with more and more of these useless cash grabs being pushed out rather than quality promising content, like what once was many months ago. It pains me to give a review to this that slanders it, and does not recommend it. This game was amazing and I loved it very, very much. It truly is sad to see it come to this point.",

However, I felt pretty inclined after the last few weeks events between Overkill and the Payday community to write a review for Payday 2 once the drama had died down and I could view everything from a level perspective. Now that I have, I will say that Payday 2 is a good game, if incredibly grindy. It's a good game to play with friends, not unlike L4D2 or Vermintide. The progression is there and it's relatively solid. However, I can't recommend the game in good faith given the recent drama. The introduction of microtransactions was originally promised by the developers as something that would never happen. Indeed, I also believed this and this is why I wholeheartedly supported Overkill by purchasing DLC and by extension, supporting their product. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a lie. Now, microtransactions allow an individual to get skins on their weapons which, unlike CS:GO (which has a sensible model for this), these skins actually give stat boosts. Thus, we now have a game that's pay-to-win in some sense, as well as the introduction of microtransactions and costly DLC. I have nothing against DLC personally, but I am against a developer lying to their playerbase, especially one that has been loyal over the life of Payday 2.  For that reason, I would encourage folks to avoid Payday 2. If you're looking for a good horde-like game with progression, I wholeheartedly recommend Warhammer End Times: Vermintide. Other good games similar to the genre would be Left 4 Dead 2 and Killing Floor. Support developers that don't lie to their playerbase.",

            "review_text": "I used to be an avid payday fan. I played a lot of Payday 1 and was very hyped for Payday 2. It was an instant pre-order for me. As soon as I got into the beta, I was amazed at how it felt. It was great. For the first half year I was having loads of fun. Then slowly I started realising that were only were a meager ammount of heists. And that the mechanics were not all that great at times.  But then the DLCs came. At first the DLCs were decent money. You payed €6,- for 6 heists, 4 masks with patterns and materials and 3 guns.  Then came the weapon pack. Which was €5,- but contained 3 guns, 4 masks + mats and frag grenades. Not bad in itself, even though I thought frag grenades did not really make sense for a bank-robber in the first place.  Then came another weapon pack. And then a courier pack. And a sniper pack.  And then arrived Big Bank. €7,- for 1 gun, 4 masks + mats and 1 heist. Oh and a pre-planning feature.  So lets recap. Where we payed €6 for 6 heists(5 Armored Transport heists and 1 bonus mission), 4 Masks+mats, 3 guns, we are now paying €7,- for 1 heist, 1 gun and 4 masks+mats.  And then we got even more weapon packs. Then afterwards came the shameless cross-promotion with John Wick, which did not make sense in any way. Then a female heister, and then another heister. All of which cost money to even get. The total cost for all DLCs is €114,81.  Does that sound like a normal game? Not to me. Payday 2 has become the cash-milking cow for Overkill studios. Even now with the 'hype-train' where they encourage us to buy DLC so we can get even more (payed-)DLC.   The heists are still repetitive. The dynamic and high-speed feel of the first game is gone. It's still a bag-throwing simulator. As someone who enjoyed the feeling of completing heists, I now no longer feel joy in this when I have to shell out increasingly more money for increasingly less content.  All I can say is that the spirit of Payday to be, is dead.",

The good...  You can play with dlc you do not own as long as the host owns said dlc.  It has a decent selection of guns and levels to keep you coming back.  The soundtrack is pretty good.  Can be fun punching someone with a stack of money all while trying not to blow up the meth lab.  Perks that allow you to shout at things and make them magically work.  Yell at friend and he heals himself,that EMT course paid off.  Also for the hoarders out there tons of mask and mods to collect.Of course a lot those are tied to paid dlc  Throw money in the water instead of the boat and watch your friends freak out.  Die a lot because bots are about as handy as a one legged man in an ♥♥♥ kicking contest,and sometimes random people are just as smart.50/50 shot no matter if you pick bots or random people that you will get the job done.   The bad...  Trying to cash in and thinks it is CS-GO so they decided to add skins and on top of that stats tied to said skins  Smallish Maps and a bit over priced dlc.Weapon balance is off and gives yo wtf moments  Spams the A.I to make it harder,in turn some of the A.I seems to be bullet sponges which remind me of Borderlands on higher levels.  How is i can make millions but i still can not afford a working drill.  Can feel boring and reptitive after awhile.  Russians seem to really love this game so much that they pretty much bought most of the hype fuel for the train.Thanks to Russia we get more over priced dlc instead of promised free content  I hate the Tom Fisher clone who thinks he is bruce lee and i am tired of games being hard only because they spam A.I.  Finally it is really missing a way to make your own hiest and allow a workshop of sorts ...wait i think i know why If they did then few would have any reason to buy monthly dlc that is over priced,and buy into there events and broken promises.  Dear Santa all i want for Christmas is a working drill so i can heist without ♥♥♥♥ breaking down and i also want to have a nice hide out it such a mess please send some elfs to help tidy up.   In the end i have to give this game a thumbs down to many broken promises and over priced dlc and to much of it and the microtransactions was the worse offender.",

The first one was more of a L4D experience that was about holding a place and surviving. The second one added good stealth, and new mechanics (some are super over used, bag packing and throwing are the worst ofenders) But it was a legitimate good time and online was a blast always being 3 seconds away from being caught and seriously underspecced for a front assault. But then the DLCs started coming out. (You must know the first game had just one DLC pack that gave you a character, a weapon, some masks, 2 heists and some skills so real bang for buck there) At first the DLCs were not great but added some fun features and even some free stuff like the Diamond store and the infamous update. But then they decided that that was not enough and Started dropping 1 char, 1 mask and some skin packs sure not great but you don't really needed that character to get anything you could get a new Heist for the same Price. But then they decided that the best weapons were going to be in the new DLC packs, and to add injury they started 'rebalacing' the base and old DLC weapons, that meant that unless you wanted to be severely underpowered you had to get the DLC packs.  And now after saying that they would not add micro-transactions they did, weapon skins, doesn't sound terrible I mean CS-GO did it and that is a good game. Well not here the skins are not cosmetic, that means that after nerfing the weapons to insane levels (pistols being more powerful than shotguns) you can either buy DLC packs of non nerfed ewapons or pay to get skins that will get whatever level you already had.  That means a fun game just became a Pay to Win cash grab. P.D. Don't bother with the base game anymore.",

However, OVERKILL themselves and, most notably, producer Almir Listo have continued to be an issue.   The biggest point made is that of the microtransactions, with which OK and Almir went back on their original word to the community. Personally, I do not much care about the microtransactions, but that is beside the point; OVERKILL's response to community outcry has been nothing short of idiotic. Rather than listen to their community's criticism, they continue to uphold this system which so many vehemently vilify, and OVERKILL's continued trend of negligence and greed is disgusting. I simply cannot suggest supporting a company which has become so interested in money over the happiness of its fanbase. The game itself is still great fun, but OK themselves have plenty to learn. Even my own vast stores of tolerance are running dry; more and more, I grow less fond of OK and the toxicity which their foolishness has invoked. Makes me wish I'd never given this game a single dollar from my wallet or minute of my life.  7.5/10 for the game itself, 2/10 for OVERKILL, 1/10 for Almir in particular.",

This game is completly co-op based but if you get it with some friends you will not regret your purchase.

Although I disagree with the model - I have already paid for the game, its contents, its DLCs that I wanted, why on Earth should I be expected to pay even more for pay-to-win content - I would like to leave this review for people who may be considering purchasing the game, based on my overall experience of it.  Great game, loads of fun. Several issues still exist, but they were generally addressed quickly. This is no longer true however. It's not a top-tier game, but you could tell that the producers used to try very hard to make their game something to be proud of.  To celebrate their fourth anniversary, unpolished daily updates have been released. These content have been worked on for some time in advance, in preparation for the event. Yet, despite all their preparation, the quality of the contents released were sub-par, full of bugs (e.g. teleporting the player's location out of map and turning them invincible), and simply disappointing. All communications with the community ceased, and the bugged and broken content still remains in the game. Some of these bugs are completely game-breaking, making the gaming experience unenjoyable, and completely unplayable, at worst.  I would have recommended it in the past, but now the devs appear to have given up on their game. Expect the quality this game to go downhill even faster than it currently is. We are already witnessing pathetic and desperate cash-grabs - not just from the addition of microtransactions in the game, but also from these frequent discounts of their products in an attempt to trick people to buy their game - and it is highly unlikely that it will get any better.

I have 20 hours and several more on top of that on friends' accounts, and while the game is fairly enjoyable to an extent, the business practices are not.  The reason I'm bringing the developers into my review is that this is a constantly expanding game: the developers are directly involved in ALL of your future enjoyment of the product. I can frankly say that my personal future enjoyment of this product was ruined thanks to the cash cow strategies that Overkill decided to employ after their first couple DLC.  To talk a bit about the game: Payday 2 improves upon the biggest flaw of the first: it feels much less repetitive with its branching missions and offering multiple means to an end during gameplay. The leveling up, while honestly a chore and more time consuming than anything, does add a bit of incentive towards playing the game. The perks offered through the leveling system, however, does make your heist life much easier. At launch, Payday 2 was a major improvement over Payday in every aspect, and it was an extremely enjoyable co-op game.  At some point in time, DLC became a requirement to get the full experience of Payday 2. Slowly, overpowered weapons trickled in. DLC-locked missions are understandable, especially considering how only the host needs to own them, so it would be unfair to complain about those. As overpowered weapons and similar DLC trickled in, I suppose something went off in the managements' eyes, and they decided that their revenue was more important than their game. Despite promising that no microtransactions would make it into the game, they made it into the game in high amounts. The developers' response to the (highly dedicated) community of the product was an arrogant 'the system, economically, is working as intended' or something along those lines. On a platform where consumer and developer communicate directly, they decided to treat customers by ignoring their concerns and when forced to reply, replying in 'PR speak' which wasn't well thought-out.",

They released some content for free, but the better content was always paid, and then they completely screwed up things by introducing a Team Fortress 2/CS:GO economy of dropped items and locked-off items that require a key to be purchased for real money to open, then exasperated things by introducing skins with stat boosts, The game became a 'fee-to-pay' game and just isn't very fun compared to Payday: The Heist. It seems like Payday 2 has much more to do than Payday: The Heist, but a lot of that 'more' is just not very fun. The tension and smarts of Payday: The Heist is gone in Payday 2 and is replaced by 'gotta go fast' gameplay to try and cheese the AI along with 'strategy' that just involves stacking buffs so you can takedown Bulldozers with ease and become a bullet sponge. If you can play this game strictly with friends then you might have a good time, but otherwise if you venture into the toxic community solo then you're likely going to have a bad time unless you're a glutton for punishment and annoyance. Also keep in mind that even with sales you're likely going to be spending over $60 for the 'full' game. Really disappointed with Payday 2, and more so with how greedy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-ish Overkill has become with the millions from Payday 2 that inflated their bank account and their egos.

With the announcement of the newest heister, people have been excited as can be over the knowledge that, surprise, he's free!

Payday 2 is still a fun game, and always will be, but at some point you have to stop poking the bees nest. Scroll down a bit, past my review. You see all those negative ones? The game may overall have a positive rating, but it's the most hardcore players with hundreds of hours of gameplay like me leaving the negative reviews. We are not newcomers, we have been around since the beginning, when Payday 2 was the first game in a long time to not be crowd funded or released with DLC or microtransactions.

Thats okay, a dlc or two to make them get a bit more money. Only, it didnt stop. The DLC content started coming out like factory, swords, guns, guns #2, mods, mods #2. There was no end to this.  I decided to let it pass since i enjoyed the game with friends, making builds to traverse harder difficilties in all the possible ways. But not anymore.  Recently micro-transactions were included. Pay for a drill, pay for the safe (with real money) then open them to get a chance at a weapon skin... THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR STATS. Think about it. How? Why?

The DLC in this game usualy contain weapons that have advantage over some enemies (like snipers and grenades being counter to shields) but the non dlc paying players dont have access to any similar weapons, other players only get grenades if the DLC payer places the grenade suit case to the map during briefing. Also there are DLC weapons that can instakill the most toughest enemies called Bulldozers, while the non dlc payers have to use huge ammouth of time to kill them. - DLC Characters, you dont just get new skin, you also get new perc tree that give you more stat boosts over non dlc paying players, you also get few weapons and few mask. - DLC amount, there are so many DLC in this game that even EA would be jellous. - Microtransactions, not only you have to pay to play the game, pay to get better weapons, you also have RNG crates that you need open with real money costing 'drills' (keys) that give skins... WITH STAT BOOSTS, non paying players have very minimal change to get any key drills from rng drops, but there is also huge change that you get weapon skin to a weapon that is dlc locked.   Overall i cant recomend this game. Player is almost forced to buy more dlc to get new weapons (and weapons to counter special enemies like shields and Bulldozers) and to get more percs. And if you want to maximize your weapond effectivenes you have to have all the attachment dlc and skins for your weapon.

Features promised at release have not yet been implemented, yet low quality DLC keeps pouring out. Balance has become a joke and stability is abysmal. Every new update to the game is hyped and the result is always a huge disappointment, with the developers always taking the easiest path to barely meet some of their promises and making excuses for why the rest weren't delivered (but will be some day!).  The developers have recently added microtransactions to this game, which is a huge slap in the face to players. As a prospective buyer, you have probably noticed that there is a huge amount of paid DLC for this game already, so the addition of microtransactions, despite the developers assurances that PD2 would never have them, is very unnecessary. To make matters worse, the microtransaction 'safes' take the place of your regular loot drop that would ordinarily reward you an item from the base game or one of the DLCs that you paid for! And even if you were to pay cash and open the 'safe' you were awarded, there is no guarantee that you will receive an item that you can even use. Yes, many of the microtransaction ewards REQUIRE DLC packs to be used and there is no system in place to ensure that you only get items you already own the DLC for!  Most recently, a pay to win system has been added to give players experience and cash boosts for purchasing microtransaction items. Yes, the developers added 'pay to win' elements to a non-F2P game!

Overkill is not a good video game company. They have questionable morals, clearly do not listen to their player base, and have in fact broken laws put into motion by the European Union (Overkill is a Swedish company, and for those who are about as good at geography as I am, Sweden is in Europe) about things such as false advertisement.  Oh, and despite claiming that they are 'independent developers', they have NEVER been independent, always working under at least a publishing company.  Honestly, despite it being fun to play, it's at its most playable state only if you have all the DLC, so I would not buy this game unless it's on sale with at least 50% off. 75% if you live on your own.",

I started playing Payday 2 the day it came out, I even preordered it after playing the first Payday game. For the first few months I was having a blast, heisting with friends, laughs all around, and a community that didn't ♥♥♥♥ on the new guy since everyone was new and was learning(which is honestly unavoidable with any mp game). As time went on there were little things in patches I disliked. If I remember correctly, it all went downhill after Update 12. Slowly the difficulty curve started to do a 89 degree slope upwards when progressing from Very Hard to Overkill. Maybe I'm just a bad player, but also stealth heists slowly got more and more difficult. I hate having to write this review because I had so much fun with this game. It was revolutionary in my eyes, it was fun, it was action packed, and it had comedy. To me the concept of 'L4D but robbing banks' was alien and enticing. But, like I said, as time went on I grew more and more sick of the game. I ended up taking month or two long breaks and coming back to see if things changed and it reverted to the form it was on release. Before I knew it, probably at the 40th patch mark I just uninstalled. With this newest update I do not have personal experience with it since I saw the outrage and immediately backed off. Ironically, I saw the outrage right after I finished downloading it to give it another try after many months. It breaks my heart to see a game with so much potential spiral into a cash grab like this. I want to love it, but it's like a stripper. They sweet talk you and show you the goods, you think they're really interested in you, you give them the money and then they yank your testicles out of your ♥♥♥♥♥ocket. If it was 2 years ago I would have recommended this game and shouted in all caps how you should buy it in this review. Unfortunately I can't recommend it in it's current state. When dev's make promises, sincere promises, then go back on them without a seconds notice and without consulting the community before pushing it on them, I have to say for shame. Shame on you Overkill. I loved you, and then you yanked my testicles out of my ♥♥♥♥♥ocket.  EDIT: TL;DR - Microtransactions are BS, especially when they are linked to stat boosters, not cosmetics, especially after a nerf. Also 6 dollars for a character? Jesus I don't have mommy and daddy to buy games for me, I have tuition to pay.",

            "review_text": "I've had great times with this game. Particularly with friends. A short while ago I would have recommended a purchase, but as you will probably have noticed by the other negative reviews out there, things have changed, and the game and the developers are not what they once were.   The Short Story   Payday 2 was uniquely profitable even before release, which lead to multiple updates and paid DLCs to flesh out and expand the content. Over time however things got worse, and now it's profusely obvious that this no longer a game, but rather an experiment in how much money a company can make from one product.   The Long Story   8 months ago Overkill announced the 'Hype Train Event', a community event where content for the game would be released, such as a new character and weapon mods, as long as certain 'goals' were met. Unlike previous 'Crimefest' events, these goals were directly tied to DLC sales. To expedite accumulation of 'hype fuel', Overkill released two fresh DLC packs, the 'Overkill' pack, and the 'Completely Overkill' pack. The Completely Overkill Pack was £15/$20, and 'limited', which meant that only 50,000 could be bought. The actual content of this pack was kept secret, apart from a skin for the escape van, and 4 in-game masks with particle effects.  We were told this secret would be cosmetic only, and lead to believe that it would be released in 'Spring Break', with the rest of the hype train content. Neither of these things were true.  The secret was 1 weapon skin, out of a possible 25. All 25 were ranked in terms of 'quality' and 'condition'. Meaning that there were common skins, and more rare (read: better), and even super rare 'legendary' skins. These had unique modifications unobtainable any other way. Which skin you got was determined by random chance. So yeah, some people will have got a super rare skin that looked great, with stat boosts, and 'team boosts', worth at least the initial cost of the Completely Overkill Pack on the steam market, whereas the majority got something worth approximately £1.  Not only that, it was random chance what 'condition' your skin would be in. This meant that the skin would appear worn and scratched. These textures for the most part made the skin look absolutely terrible.   I'm digressing a little here. What matters more than any of this disappointment, or misleading marketing, is the reaction to the feedback from the community concerning the fiasco. Almir, an executive producer and the general 'face' of Overkill, did an AMA on reddit. In it he basically said that according to their figures (i.e the money they're making from the steam market), the majority of the Payday 2 playerbase liked the update which added weapon skins.  I've seen comments from the Starbreeze shareholders concerning the new direciton Payday 2 is taking, and in summary, they believe that the players don't know what they want, and that ultimately whatever Overkill want to do to squeeze profits out of Payday is good with them.  Basically, the game is quite good, really fun actually. It has a few lingering bugs even after all these years and the engine is hella wonky, but it's enjoyable. There is way too much drama involved with it from here on out though. They will take and take and take, until everybody playing Payday 2 tells them that enough is enough. That won't happen though.

Today the vast majority of the DLC for this game is all client-specific, with weapons, skins, even characters, being buyable unlocks. Making the game a literal Pay-to-Win game, is something I could never agree with, nor endorse.  Their attempt to add microtransactions is the straw that finally broke the camels back for me. And to make it even worse, their response to the huge backlash seems to be to make is so that drills can drop randomly. Disgusting, and completely missing the reason for the hate.

So:  - The Cool Kids could finish any mission on the highest difficulty because they were much better equipped than us  - Their guns could fire a single shot (while our stupid avatars could only release the trigger after wasting 2 for every 1 precisely fired bullets)  - They could crash the mall in literally seconds by lobbing grenades like there's no tomorrow, but we had to go in there and do it the usual way  - They killed enemies with a single melee hit with their fancy melee weapons, when we needed 3  - They could run faster than you, their armor regenerates magically, they can dual wield, evade bullets  I can:  - Accept that my team would never do as well as the cool kids, as they are simply better in every aspect; or  - Pay yet another 300% of what I paid for my pre-sale criminal edition version for the missing parts of the game; and  - Buy dozens of 'drills' to get over the top weapons for myself.   I unfortunately brought along many friends, convinced them to buy and play the then a great game. It looked like a good idea to get the criminal something edition. There was no player milking announced (even though it was probably already planned). I regret that decision.

I'll explain for the uninitiated (briefly).  I bought Payday 2 on steam a year and a half to two years ago just after buying my first gaming PC. I'd come straight from Xbox 360 console land and was keen to try out one of my favourite games on that platform (despite the god awful graphics, glitches and atrocious performance) again except with all the up to date content, better graphics etc etc. Things were great at first, the game was a blast to play and Overkill seemed like good developers who were always 'down' with the gamers who enjoyed their game. Then things started to sour slightly.  The DLC. Ohhh the DLC. DLC if implemented correctly both content wise and pricepoint wise can be great and a welcome addition to the game. Unfortuately for us - the consumer - Payday 2's DLC was rarely ever those two things and in fact continues that shoddy trend to this day. Endless weapon packs, with progressively more ludicrous weaponary and dodgy masks - nearly all of which are locked behind silly achievement walls. That is only the start though. I won't bother going into much detail regarding the various (and many) faux-pas Overkill has made (there are thousands more reviews on steam with the details plus google is your friend but to put it simply - Overkill basically milks its user base for every penny all the while grinning the whole time.  Which has lead us to this point - microtransactions. the thing they said they'd never do. They did it. Unashamedly. No going back, here forever, like it or lump it microtransactions. Now, one of the reasons I used to love this game even back with the muddy visuals of the xbox 360 version was the atmosphere the game and its gunfights had. The ambience. Clearly the game takes (or rather took) a lot of inspiration from 'Heat' (great film by the way - check it out). However the seriousness of the vanilla game has basically been slowly erroded by terrible comedy DLC and now these weapon skin microtransactions. Because they have stat boosts linked to then I would HAVE to use them. I don't glean any enjoyment from pew-pewing with rainbow pink guns but that's what i'd have to do were I to continue with this mess of a game. So basically i'm not - i'm done. Forever.  Anyway i'm rambling so I will end it here. In closing I seriously can't recommend this game to anyone. Steer clear, your wallet will thank you.",

I often sit and think how much headway I could make in life if it wasn't for internet crime game, but the drills alone bring joy and meaning to my life. But then this new thing was introduced to the game. This new thing will completely break and ruin the game! In the past, I did the old thing in the old way, and that was fine. I did it, I was fine, and nothing went wrong. But now there's this new thing... why?!  There are many reasons why this new thing will break the game.   The weapons we farmed will have different value now.  The work we did will be easier or harder for subsequent people to do.  It is different.  It is not the same as it was before.  The way it was before is how I want it to remain.  It is new.  I don't like it.  These are just the things that come to mind after barely glancing through the first paragraph of Crimefest. But, enough of that. Can we please stop this new thing before it's too late? I can tell you all about why the new thing is bad. I did the old thing day in, day out, and I was better at it than all of you. I had level 25 Infamy of the old thing. If you think my being too used to the old thing is why I dislike the new thing, you are sadly mistaken! For I have like level 25 Infamy of the new thing, too. Even though it's new, I'm still better at it than all of you, even the people who are better at it than I am, and I've been better at it since before I was born. But, still, the old thing was better, and this new thing is bad, and wrong, and badly wrong.  Devs, Overkill, Starbreeze, please hear my pleas. This new thing will change the game from how it was before, and this cannot be allowed to happen. Stop, now. I know you'll listen to me, because you always listen to me—and only me—because we've known each other all our lives, even when we didn't know it. We used to do the thing (not the new thing, the old one) by the place, and you once told me, 'Ruugab, your three semesters of Game Development at the community college give you more knowledge and experience than all of us together, and we'll let you veto any changes you don't like.' Well, that didn't happen. You went behind my back, and you did it to my face.  Anyway. I'm not bitter, though I will uninstall Payday 2 at the drop of a hat if this thing isn't changed. I just want to be clear: this new thing is bad, and the old thing is the only way that anything should ever be done.",

            "review_text": "The most upsetting part of Payday 2 is the direction Overkill decided to take during the later years of Payday 2's constantly updating development. The first set of Paid DLC practices weren't so bad- new heists, sick! New weapons, I suppose that's worth money, maybe! New characters? I never asked for this. But then at some point DLC became outrageous- too much money for too little content, and then the same formula just kept multiplying as time passed, with less content being added each time for the same price. When the microtransactions were implemented, it served as the last straw that even the veteran community of Payday 2 had with the game.   At it's core, it's a pretty fun game. Coop shooters are always fun, and Payday 2 had solid gunplay and gameplay mechanics. At launch, though, it was still quite fault and only had so few heists with little scope- level design of Payday 2 was to me it's weakest point. Coming from the Hollywood-style, grand, and massive heists the original Payday: The Heist had to offer, Payday 2 was very lacking in the level design department- with most of the maps being confined to a small area and having EXTREMELY repetitive objectives (Drill, Drill, DRILL! Pick up bag, throw back, pick up bag, throw bag!). For a game about heisting- each level did not feel grand at all, which is something you'd expect from a heist. Future DLC slightly remedied the Level Design issue by offering larger levels with more objectives and situations, thank goodness for that.  However, oversaturation of DLC lead to an imbalance of weapons and meta- with some playstyles being completely locked to DLC and some weapon-types like Sniper Rifles and Light Machine Guns being completely locked behind a playwall- not something you really want in any game. When the extremely unnecessarily addition of microtransactions occured, the game took a hit from the community. Indeed- it was an unwelcome change that only served to disrespect customers. Further business and community practices Overkill had partaken in had completely driven me and many others away from the game. I pick the game up every now and then to play with friends- but I always have a sour taste in my mouth when I play because of Overkill's recent practices. I have yet to play the new Point Break heists which I think look fun and Hollywood-inspired, however the greedy actions taken have just driven me away.",

I held my onto my review because I thought (and hoped) that Overkill would do something to either correct their changes or at the very least, make amends somehow with better quality/content. Througout the last few days of their annual event 'Crimefest' they had given the players hope that epic and great (also free) content would be released but in the end, little has come forth.  Through DLCs, crowdfunded events, and other PR events, the loyal fanbase has given a fair amount of investment into Overkill and the Payday franchise. But where has the money gone to?  Of the 10 days of crimefest, possibly best additions to the game were 3 heists. 1 is brand new, while 2 are ports of old heists from Payday 1. The rest of the content? A rebalancing of the weapons that have made the game oddly broken. Quality of life changes were made for the multiplayer interface. 1 new gun. Masks.  Where has the money gone? While I can understand making (and to a certain extent, porting) maps can take time and effort but what about the rest? Adding filters to the game selection? Adding one weapon? Tweaking numbers on weapons? Masks that would've taken the modding community half a day to make (and for free)? It seems that the company is no longer putting effort or money into making this game better anymore, and for that reason, I don't see why the players should put more money into it either.   Oh yea, and jump animations. Because that is what the community has always wanted. What a big surprise and wonderful climax to their long list of updates.",

            "review_text": "Payday two is a story of a game that, during the span of its popularity, squandered countless opportunities on its way to becoming an excellent game. More often than not, the devs would constantly choose to ignore problems with the game in favor of releasing more DLC and running ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized 'community events' which were generally speaking player-driven ad campaigns. This was ok for a time, but in light of the most recent one of these community events, I've decided it's finally time to put the game down. TL;DR below, but if you plan on buying this game, I encourage you to read this first.  Flash back a few years. The game had good core gameplay and an interesting meta and slowly rose from a personal score of a passable C to an A that I would recommend to friends time and time again as the game evolved. I've even purchased the game at least once for a friend so we could enjoy it together.  Unfortunately, eventually the developer, Overkill, either misunderstood completely why their game was a success, or decided it was time to cash in once people were hooked. Enter nearly $100 dollars worth of DLC over the course of two years or so. Again, this was ok for a while. It was at least a matter of interest to follow how the DLC changed the meta for better or for worse. The playerbase rolled with the punches and kept hoping that eventually the developers would catch on to what an amazing chance they had to make a great experience for their players. This came to a head during the 2015 crimefest, or one of the many thinly veiled attempts to utilize player driven 'hype' to market the game.  Crimefest 2015 was supposed to be a free event for the players, rewarding them for their 'hard work' making the last crimefest a colossal success. What players got instead was a total weapon 'rebalance', devoid of any semblance of actual balance, some minor features labeled 'rewards' that were passable as minor patches, and the cherry on top: The ability to pay real-world money to gamble for weapon skins. Weapon skins which supplied stats. Stats on weapons that were significantly reworked to accommodate these skins.  Unsurprisingly, the vocal members of the community were upset.  The remainder of the week during crimefest, the playerbase remained vocal about this. They asked questions about why they had to pay microtransactions to receive benefit from their 'free' community update when it was claimed on multiple occasions that the game would never have microtransactions, and asked if any of their concerns would be addressed, all without hearing a single comment on the matter. Finally, at the end of crimefest, after each update had rolled out, the community got their answer.  Simply put, it was a resounding 'no'.  For future developers, please look back at this event and use this as an example of a complete and total failure to understand your playerbase and why they play your game. Either that or it was a total success if it was intended to cycle out their old meta-driven playerbase for a new, more lucrative gambling playerbase. It was shortly clear that Overkill was changing nothing.  TL;DR: my goal here is to say that this company and developer is no longer worth supporting. It is increasingly clear that this developer has been constantly exploiting its playerbase in the name of putting out a quality game, which on multiple occasions has proven to be a false claim. Goodbye overkill, it was fun while it lasted.",

            "review_text": "As someone with almost 400 hours in this game, and having played it for two years now, I know a bit about it.  The game started off very well. It was engaging and entertaining, the staff actually seemed to care about the playerbase (As it was smaller at the time) and the game was a fun way to spend an evening with friends. However over time OverKill has taken all the popularity to their heads, and is currently dragging what was once an enjoyable experience and pushing it to a lower level than the Mariana Trench.  The game, whilst being semi-enjoyable now, provides little to no challenge whatsoever. I can easily clear just about every mission without any problems on the harder difficulties. Rather than add new jobs, characters or other ways to enjoy the game, Overkill as started to smother what was once a burning flame in the gaming world, with microtransactions and buyable items that break the experience for everyone who doesn't have them.  When I purchased this game, I was very thrilled to have it. I got the DLC for it immediately, and spent countless hours completing heists either online or on my own. As time passed, DLC was added more and more frequently, and even though the purchases got slightly redundant after a while, I was still happy to give my money to a company who had shown to care for their playerbase. However I had noticed over time that, in fact, Overkill does not care about anyone or anything that may or may not play their title.  How have they done this? First of all is one of the most blatant of things, ignoring those with serious complaints or ideas, and listening only to those with praise and worship towards themselves. Boosting your ego is fine on occasion, but ignoring others with legitimate complaints isn't the way to go about things. The players in the community had done nothing but help and provide insight to the developers about things occuring, and what was enjoyed or not. Game developers who care for their buyers would typically listen to the masses and try to compromise, however Overkill leans towards those who would rather just throw money at them blindly. That's fine and all, abuse your buyers and take the money they give you, it's their fault I suppose.  From DLC once every so often, to boxes of microtransactions and rapid DLC being shoved down the throats of the playerbase, Overkill has let what was once a very enjoyable game slip down to a worthless piece of software with nothing redeemable about it anymore.  As a long time supporter of the game, until very recently, I am both shocked and appalled at the way Overkill has shifted their views and their ideas. It's not about the players anymore, it's not about the experience or the game, it's just the money to them. So, they will continue to flood us with mindless microtransactions and packs of useless cosmetics that break the game for the players who can't afford them. As they move forward with the game, missions will be made incredibly difficult, too compensate for the one shot one kill, full automatic assault rifle people can buy. Meanwhile people without said item will struggle to make any progress at all.  I am very dissapointed, and if I could demand a refund I would. But they'll ignore me, as they will anyone else with a concern about the game they've ruined, or anyone hoping to get even a bit of their wasted time back.  TL:DR Don't buy this game, please for the love of god. These developers don't deserve your money.  - KnyghtFalcon",

Stay away from this game. And buy the other game you wanted to buy.",

Personaly if you want to be part of the payday experience get some friends and buy Payday the heist as a four pack next time its 90% off.  EDIT: If a unnoticed review isnt enough for you scroll down the recent reviews and you might see the same thing i did, out of twenty something reviews three were posotive, all three were troll reviews saying things such as 'love pay to win' and similar views.",

            "review_text": "The most upsetting part of Payday 2 is the direction Overkill decided to take during the later years of Payday 2's constantly updating development. The first set of Paid DLC practices weren't so bad- new heists, sick! New weapons, I suppose that's worth money, maybe! New characters? I never asked for this. But then at some point DLC became outrageous- too much money for too little content, and then the same formula just kept multiplying as time passed, with less content being added each time for the same price. When the microtransactions were implemented, it served as the last straw that even the veteran community of Payday 2 had with the game.   At it's core, it's a pretty fun game. Coop shooters are always fun, and Payday 2 had solid gunplay and gameplay mechanics. At launch, though, it was still quite fault and only had so few heists with little scope- level design of Payday 2 was to me it's weakest point. Coming from the Hollywood-style, grand, and massive heists the original Payday: The Heist had to offer, Payday 2 was very lacking in the level design department- with most of the maps being confined to a small area and having EXTREMELY repetitive objectives (Drill, Drill, DRILL! Pick up bag, throw back, pick up bag, throw bag!). For a game about heisting- each level did not feel grand at all, which is something you'd expect from a heist. Future DLC slightly remedied the Level Design issue by offering larger levels with more objectives and situations, thank goodness for that.  However, oversaturation of DLC lead to an imbalance of weapons and meta- with some playstyles being completely locked to DLC and some weapon-types like Sniper Rifles and Light Machine Guns being completely locked behind a playwall- not something you really want in any game. When the extremely unnecessarily addition of microtransactions occured, the game took a hit from the community. Indeed- it was an unwelcome change that only served to disrespect customers. Further business and community practices Overkill had partaken in had completely driven me and many others away from the game. I pick the game up every now and then to play with friends- but I always have a sour taste in my mouth when I play because of Overkill's recent practices. I have yet to play the new Point Break heists which I think look fun and Hollywood-inspired, however the greedy actions taken have just driven me away.",

How can you justify the 7 free DLC:s for supporters, even if they include the weapons in the pool that the safe can give, when the said supporters have most likely bought all of the DLC's already?  You could've atleast given Mega -masks for the other characters available.. It'd atleast make sense.    And why the hell do you still waste time making hotfixes to  Windows XP  !?!

I've never supported Overkill's business model but continued to purchase the DLCs just to play with my friends. I've had so many great memories in this game and even gotten a couple friends into the game, hell i even went to PaydayCon and met the voice actors, that's how much of a fan i was. It's okay to have 3 or 4 DLCs, but lol guess what? Payday 2 has 37... THIRTY SEVEN! Even made the community work hard for Crimefest 2 and then f*ck them over by adding in something they wouldn't. Also buying a support pack called The Completely Overkill pack (basically a donation) and said that there would be an awesome outcome if you bought the pack, so everyone was expecting an awesome map or something really game changing and delaying the pack's secret content for months and then it just turns out to be gun skins that the people were already complaining about, proving further that they don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their customers. Also them posting an announcement saying 'We're sorry' but then release another collaboration DLC that cost $7 that was most likely funded by Warner Brothers. L.O.L. This game is nothing but a cash grab and i will not purchase any future Overkill games that will most likely be buried with DLCs. Imagine a single player game made by Overkill with a 4 choice dialogue wheel but 3 of them are locked and says 'DLC DIALOGUE ONLY'. I can see it now. This game is a perfect example of why not to support greedy developers. But hey, if you have 80% of the DLC then why stop playing? You got most of the content. Overkill are just nothing but people who don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their fanbase and they've made that pretty clear over the past couple months. I'm surprised Valve hasn't contacted them about this because having 37 DLCs is definietly not okay, and they like to brag about it too! You will usually see a 'Heisters! This is our 12323978th DLC! Look at these cool items! Buy it now!' And as of now they have an advertisement about the new movie coming out named 'Point Break' as said earlier, they like to make collaborations as DLCs and right as you boot up the game, the ad for the new movie is right there playing. Makes you want to be a pirate huh? Since i own most of the content, i'll probably continue playing, but i will no longer buy DLCs from Overkill unless they are gifted to me because it's that hard to lose something that's been a big part of your life, like losing a best friend. This game has been driven down to the ground hard and will continue to get worse, so i'll say this one more time, if you haven't bought this game yet, don't. Most of the things they add in this game should be free except for the map packs. It's painful to write all of this down it really is, but at a time, this game was a 8/10, now it's a 4.7/10 for me. Good job OverEA for ruining such a great game and screwing over your loyal fans.  EDIT: There's now a new DLC coming out that's a collaboration between Payday 2 and.... Goat Simulator.

They've killed it, with a 'balance' patch that makes most weapons near useless, and several pistols overpowered to the point that there is no challenge. And greed. Hope they're happy with what the game has become, many thought it was doing well before, and all it took was a week to change that.",

In my opinion it kinda killed the game.  I dont say its a bad game , its a pay to win. If you can enjoy limited content you could buy it but I wouldnt recommend to do so if it isnt on sale.

It used to have a nice modding community that only changed the client side appearance of the game. The weapon stats didn't make the most sense, but the guns didn't suck.   I get that some game mechanics may need to be altered in a game to help improve the experience of the game. This game is no stranger to that. First it was the stealth mechanics, then they eliminated tier bonuses in the skills section for the current perk deck system. This was followed by several decks being added and then altered so that they may have health regen. I took these changes in stride (OVK I'm still annoyed about ♥♥♥♥ing up my Berserker build with the Muscle deck...).  Unfortunately they have once again tinkered with the game and its really ruined what used to be a fun game. This weapons rebalance does make every weapon equal, and by that I mean they are all ♥♥♥♥ poor excuses for firearms. For one explain to me how a 12 gauge shotgun doesn't hit has hard as a 9mm pistol? Overkill do you understand anything about firearms? I get you want to nerf the more popular weapons to bring other weapons into the lime light, but you simply did it wrong. This to me is the biggest disappointment of the FREE content that was to be released during Crimefest 2015.   Overkill and Starbreeze have lied and decieved their fans with several events based around the community only to short change them when it comes to the reward for their (the community's) effort. There needs to be some serious incite into your business operations if you want people to ever buy one of your products again.   On the MTs: I like skins; they are a cool way to customize one's weapons so that other people can see it. These skins however should not have stat boosts and certainly should not be purchased with real money. PEOPLE HAVE BILLIONS IN OFFSHORE (in game non-spendable) MONEY THAT THEY CAN'T DO A ♥♥♥♥ING THING WITH, WHY CAN'T I BUY SKINS WITH THAT!!!!!  You let your fans down, I hope you made enough money for yourselves that you won't have to work again because I wouldn't hire a single person with Starbreeze or Overkill on their resume after this ♥♥♥♥ storm.",

Their latest addition, however, has shattered my opinion of them. They have added a CS:GO style Crate/Key system, for weapon skins that provide minor stat bonuses.

After that though, Crime Fest October 2015 happened...  New microtransactions that added a weapon skin system EXACTLY the same to CSGO or other similar weapon skin case systems. The worst part, you can get skins for DLC weapons when you don't own the DLC, wtf is that? I know most of you can agree with this new system being BS and I urge people downloading the game during the 10 day free trial, to read these reviews if you think about buying it.  All in all, It's a pretty OK game, but the amount you need to pay for new content is ridiculously high and along with the microtransactions, just know that if you intend on playing this game alot more, you will most likely need to sink money into it at some time, so I urge you to only buy stuff when its on sale, because this game is not worth the $100+ I already sunk into it.  Thanks for reading and hopefully players playing during the 10 day free trial will read this before deciding on whether or not to buy the game.  PS Don't let the GOTY edition fool you, it is worth the $12.50 it is right now, but quite a few things in that list are thing we got for free.

But now that Overkill have reaped the benefits of a faithful community, and their help in turning Payday 2 into a huge succes, they've chosen to leverage all that trust and hard work, into selling people lottery tickets for imaginary products with no obvious value. Random boxes, which by design are intended to make people pay for a product, that isn't worth 10% of the asking price.  The premise of a crate lottery is this: 'Give us your money and you MIGHT get a product of the same value'. Mostly you won't. It's designed to make you pay 2.5 bucks for skins that cost 18 cents. That is the very definition of a scam.   Even if the vast majority of people are too smart to play, you're still golden.  It's an old trick, selling people an 'exciting' product they're not allowed to see before they pay, but sadly it's not a first for videogames - Valve does it too. CS:GO isn't offered for free either, and it obviously caters to a lot of kids, who probably don't realize they're being tricked.   It's really pretty amazing that Valve has succeeded in marketing a gambling product to kids, without any authorities taking note.  It's even more disgusting for the fact that those kids never have the chance to win any actual money. The best you can get is store credit, and you're never even afforded the agency offered to a poker player at an online casino. In this one, the house has already claimed your money the moment you buy in, and I don't know any casino for which that is actually true.  Most people would be quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if the croupier just ran away laughing. I guess gamers are just nice enough to look the other way.  Clearly though, Overkill couldn't give less of a ♥♥♥♥. They know all of this, that's why they're doing it. Just as you know that no one with half a conscience would ever want to earn a single buck this way.   Not even a Vegas casino, where kids aren't allowed, and you're at least afforded some chance to leave with actual money in your pocket.  Payday 2 may be a great game, it's certainly been one of my all time greats, but it's tainted both by this scam, and by the fact that the developers obviously don't care more about their baby, than to abuse it for the sake of such a scummy, low down trick.

That, apparently, is a reward!  At the end of each heist, when you get a card drop, it could be a Weapon Mod, cash, experience, a mask or colour/materiel for masks. Now, with this 'reward', you can now get a 'Safe' card. The only way to open this is to spend Real Money (At present $2.50 or 2.50 Euros!) on a 'Drill' which, when the safe is opened, gives you a random skin for a random weapon! And these skins also boost aspects of weapons above normal levels. After this monumental 'reward', Overkill have ignored the community outrage and anger for 4 days before giving us a patch to fix one aspect of their crap AI as a 'reward' and telling us that they refuse to discuss this until after Crimefest is over. 10 days...  It was tolerable when this game had monthly DLC's coming out, some of which were utter crap, but more than a few were good. But charging for the game, then a load of over-priced DLC's, and then on top of that gouging players another 2.50 every time for a 'key' to open these random drop safes? Nothing short of triple-dip price gouging! And the company doesn't even have the decency to admit it, they keep on banning and deleting posts that show anger and indignation about the shabby treatment that us customers are getting!  TLDR? This WAS a good game, ruined by the contempt of the developers for the community and paying customers and their escalating attempts to squeeze players of every penny they can. Stay the hell away!",

Now, it's a cash grab, and I for one feel as though my wallet has been molested.  Do Not buy this 'game'.",

I have never been one to enjoy FPSes but this is one of my favorite games. (My friends don't understand due to how I hate FPSes) and I would recommend it to most anyone.   There are a few things that make me decide to play something else, though. The game selection screen. I hate it. I HATE IT. I miss certain games because im looking at the other side of the screen, The fact that when I play a certain map too many times it takes away experience. That's ridiculous. And lastly, the P2W system that this game has become. Having to purchase weapons DLC just to be able to keep up with other players isn't very cool..I'm willing to pay for DLC for added content but when it's to be able to do as well as other players I don't really want to anymore.   Game is great. If it's on sale, don't pass it up. Not too many flaws, but enough to make you want to pass it up after awhile.",

People play this game for HOURS to unlock fancy weapons, masks and higher levels and to turn the game around on it's face and ask for money in exchange for these things is disapointing to say the least. I would not recommend this game in it's current state as the developers don't have the customers best interest at heart as we've seen with the COUNTLESS amount of DLC they fish up throughout the year, without addressing their promises and FAULTS of the game from day 1 of it being released! We were promised no pay 2 win aspects, we were promised customizable safe houses, and we were promised fixing bugs would come first not paid DLC.  Game: Don't get me wrong I do like this game. It's great fun with friends and sometimes strangers, a real true coop game where teamwork must be applied to top out, 4p coop. You get bland characters without much of a backstory outside the single page desc card, but not so bland is the way you can play each one of them. with unique skill trees, You can amass a wildly different build of a character then the next fellow, But that's because you aren't tied to playing as one character if say, the other were to be chosen. All skills from each of the Robber types (Mastermind, Ghost, Technician, Enforcer) Can be mixed, maxed or sorted however you like, so you could imagine the thrill of every player running mostly sneak perks and going full cat burglar. I immensly enjoyed this game on Xbox 360 and with the PC version in comparison, I admit is far superior. Funny thing is not enough DLC on xbox was the bad thing... Now too much DLC is starting grow into the 'bad' thing.  The levels/Jobs are somewhat ever changing, but nothing grand, maybe the safe will be in a different room or the Camera will be moved, Maybe they were going for L4D type of replayability, but it's a sad attempt at that. You could easily master all 3 layouts within a handful of playthroughs, But the layout is not where the difficulty strives, it's the communication! and man, oh man... You better pick your teammates right or else you're gonna have a much harder time trying to beat one mission on stealth then an entire 'Job' with some reliable mates.  I going mostly over my playtime on xbox 360 with inclusions of my experience through my brief playthough on PC. All in all, It's a pretty fine game but a good game only stays as great when the creators are taking care of it and the community. They(Overkill) don't seem to be doing that.   You're in for a different experience further along the road then the rest of us who've had this game before.  Buy with caution.",

From very early on I felt this game was unfinished. There seemed to be only so much you could do and I never felt it should have been released with such little content. I would say the base game itself might seem worth the price, after all it's not a normal full AAA priced game, but the fact is the base game still feels unfinished and all the DLC really bumps the price up.  I feel only now that the game itself has gotten enough content, but you are paying roughly 1.5 times the game price for the DLC alone to get it to that stage.  The thing that’s pushed it too far for me was the direction that OVERKILL had taken. Things like the unfinished feel of the game, the 'hype train' where they were asking for people to give them money for unknown rewards, and now after saying they wouldn’t they are adding micro transactions to the game.  Fact is many other reviews have gone over this and I don’t feel the need to go into it so thoroughly.  I would only recommend this game if you pick it up cheap in the steam sales and just want to play with friends. but I can't tell you how the game will change over the next few months/year.  It may in fact get a lot worse before/if it gets better.",

It was a bit rough around the edges, but somehow you never got tired of playing the same levels over and over. Each level was distinct. Each weapon was different, fufilling a different role on the team. The action was tight, the mechanics good. Notably, Payday allowed the players to carry three guns instead of the usual two. There was a little DLC that was a welcome addition at a reasonable cost.  Payday 2 was a fundamental step backwards in design and stability. A random drop system was implemented that removed control from the player in upgrading the guns they liked. Glitches abounded, ruining stealth runs and in some cases by not synchronizing which way guards face, and punishing people with weaker computers by not generating the textures required to finish levels without brute guesswork. The game is stunningly poorly optimized, I am able to run Killing floor 2 at higher settings that this. Pages were taken from the middle COD series: Guns were added, seemingly for the sake of having them in the game, which contributed little but spreading out the time it took you to get attachments for the ones you like, and taking away the distinctness of each. Weapon catagories got blended together, and players are now only able to carry two at a time. There is now several times the cost of the game in DLC, most of it gratituious. The level design team from the first game presumeably is somewhere in the DC river, wearing size 10.5 concrete. Gone are the multiple city blocks of heat street, the variety of sizes and types of objectives found originally and instead the majority of the levels involve running into a building, setting up a drill and waiting. The Stat system is insane, and poorly explained. One of the popular mods simply added explanations, one would expect that if there was that much confusion the devs would add in an explaintion.  If you told me this was a cash grab by an unrelated company that bought the IP, I wouldn't be surprised.",

This is my second most played game, next to Terraria. That right there should say a lot about what I thought. When I was actually playing and enjoying the game (and it is fun if you 'play along') I never really noticed the issues. When a new events started, I got more excited about reaching all the goals than stepping back and looking at some of the logic. Half of the event awards were bugfixes, and eveything that was not achieved would be sold as DLC. Weird, right? It's pretty bad business practice, but everyone also knew that the goals would be reached (in the end, mostly by bots and hackers). The events were mostly good, but looking back now they did a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing with the Hypetrain event where it was literally fueled by money, preordering a DLC that probably wasn't even made yet. I actually didn't really notice how stupid this was until after I stopped playing and got a bit of clairovoyence on the subject. Like most people, I got really jarred by the addition of microtransactions (which are fine on their own but were horribly executed), partly because I payed so much money form getting every DLC they released. It didn't feel like it, but over time I had spent over $200 supporting them by buying their content, and I felt a bit betrayed.  This is where I get back to the 'playing along' bit. The game was okay on release, and was well balanced but with little content. The DLC fixed that, but the game has also been massively transformed. None of the base guns and mods are good by comparison to what you can get, and additions to the game assume that you already bought everything they ♥♥♥♥ out. For example, the weapon skins are largely for DLC guns (because most of the guns in the game are largely DLC), so they are useless to someone with just the base game.  Overall, I don't think Overkill is necessarily evil, they just don't know what they're doing and executing it poorly. Payday 2 is their only big game, but it is also just one of the most successful games. They don't know what to do, and because of these ♥♥♥♥-ups they probably won't have another successful game. Too many people have been burned by Payday to ever trust this company. I also think that Overkill gets ♥♥♥♥ for maing bad DLC, then gets ♥♥♥♥ for making bad free content, so they decided to simply ignore the community. In their view, they are probably just honest game devs doing nothing wrong with an unpleasable community.",

            "review_text": "I write this update in respond to the events Overkill announced following the '15 Crimefest. I never thought my profile picture describes my face now so well. If you need a tl;dr:  Veterans: Refrain from playing, now. There is no point in supporting business practices that will turn this game into what it orginally was against. Update your review, quit the steam group, play the long con, and don't even budge until the devs think straight.  New players: This is a co-op heisting game, which sounds fun, and it is, until you are asked to pay for half a dozen DLCs to keep yourself up to speed. On top of that, the devs just wound up a pay 2 win ♥♥♥♥♥torm. There are surely better alternatives for you to spend money elsewhere for now.  ---  Knew it, I just knew it.  Last DLC pack I own was the Butcher CAR/AK mod pack. Pretty much the last pack I think was worth. Skipped Yakuza, diamond, alesso, golden grin, completely overkill and overkill pack, and the bomb.  Ever since THE Diamond was out I smelled something. Packs were carrying less value for money, and appears to be less earnestly made. More quantity, less quality, higher price. The Yakuza Pack was the first that even comes with just a character and 2 weapons with no heists at all. I was thinking Overkill was at an all time low there, but since they've said they have more than 20 months to support I thought they'll pick it up. Right before Crimefest 15 I was even a little pumped for rejoining the fun after 1 month of resting.  How mistaken I was.  The only thing good about the black market update was it was there first ever attempt to overhaul a majority of weapons in this game, DLC and non-DLC included. But that's about it. Weapons went grossly overpowered, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.  The weapon skins, resembling that of the CSGO system unsettlingly, is hidden inside safes that you get from card drops. And the drill that takes to open the safes you got costs money. Real money. Well pure cosmetics was fine by me. But worst of all, skins modifies weapon stats. So yes, this game is P2W now. And to think that the base game cost money too? This screams cash grab for any new player who doesn't know better.  This is not healthy for the community. What we'll be seeing is overpriced +stats skins selling on Steam trade and scams everywhere in no time. Veteran players who saw the better times of this game *will* leave and that drains the playerbase of quality.  This game was good. Back when Overkill called themselves indie, they deserved it. They were engaging, ambitious, focused, and caring. I put so many hours into this game, everyday for at least 2 hours. Now, half of the contents are behind a paywall and if it isn't enough, P2W elements are right by the corner to even further the disparity. I didn't find a ♥♥♥♥♥torm so large I have to put in 15 minutes to write something here, I am a quiet person online. I will not be playing this game anymore until they attempt to remedy this situation. That is, to eliminate P2W in any way, shape or form, once and for all. Almir would need to be explicit about this and not go around in circles again. This is serious.  I will be withdrawing my subscription from the steam community, and be posting the same review over Metacritic. Just so more of you know what's up. Until then, wish you luck Overkill.",

Veteran player rejoice, and new players could experience a PD2 iteration of PD:TH Missions. These were well done, and players (and customers alike) were willing to live with the change, and forget their feelings on Day 1 of Crimefest 2.  Ever looming, a darkness finally sprang from the shadows.  Update 90.  The players had no idea what hit them! In one fell swoop, Overkill announced that the 'secret rewards' for buying the completely overkill pack during the 'Hype train' event were really what the players had feared the most ; A free drill and safe (2.49$ worth in case you were not aware), as well as 8 Free DLC.  'This sounds mighty generous! Good on overkill for giving back to their consumer base', The naive onlooker will think, basking in his ignorance. Little does he know that most of the people who were willing to pay 20$ for a totally optional DLC pack, would more then likely, already own these DLC.  Not only this, but there were even more bonuses given to these Safes. Team bonus! You now give a buff to your entire squad by having these items you can purchase with real money.  I guess overkill wanted to give the players claiming this game was Pay2Win some merit.  C'est la vie.",

Spending hours with friends to complete a mission in stealth to needing to change my pants when a bulldozer turned the corner. As of a few weeks ago, no one wants to touch this game, including myself.  Will I still have memories of needing a whole team to tackle one bulldozer? Yes. But now if I really wanted to, a couple of quick pistol shots and I can solo a big guy with ease. Will I remember that action movie ending when my friend zip-lined across the bank onto the roof and saved me so we could escape? Yup, I will remember that too. Now I don't get downed because I have muscle, or better put, health regenerating steroids. Will I remember praising Overkill because they put out a wonderful game that continued to get better as we went along? I will totally remember telling people Overkill was the best. I figure you have probably seen the other reviews so we dont have to harp on that one...  Well Overkill... are you rich yet? Are you happy yet? You lost us, but hey... money right?!   PS: I would like to throw in some balance issues that I havent seen yet in other posts (maybe they were from a long time ago but who knows? This has been broken for a while). Dearest balance testers: You do not balance a game when you make the weak enemies do a billion damage and force the stronger enemies to fight with child scissors. I have downed from a single police cop/security guard more than I have died from bulldozers. Not cool. Also... from us solo offline players who grind alone because sometimes the community hosts are bad, thanks for the CPU killers we call turret trucks. At that point, your computer friends arent even worth going for.",

I quit the first time when the Overkill team damaged stealth gameplay by allowing mid-mission guard spawns before an alert had been started.  I came back around the time of the Shadow Raid mission, as stealth had been fixed. In that time, the team added a lot of other systems. It was a bit confusing, but I rolled with it. Even the DLC was not unreasonable - I felt five or so dollars every month or so was not a bad price to pay for more content for a game I enjoyed.  When I heard a new crimefest was starting up, I decided to check the game out again. The Payday 2 of today is not the Payday I knew. The very existance of microtransanctions runs counter to the principles of the first game for the the first few years of Payday 2's life. To bring up the figures I see floating around, the full game + dlc price is $130; with a nickel and diming microtransaction system meant to be P2W. The infamy system, getting levels, even buying DLCs have become useless in the face of trying to get that awesome stat boost for your gun. This is not Payday 2, this is a poor microtransaction tactic.  The crux of this review is that I would have written one years ago recommending the game, but I did not have to due to how many people did. Now that the game has drifted significantly from the game we old heisters supported years ago, I have to write one condeming the changes.",

This 'Indie Dev' trippled the team of their game post-launch, but still can't be bothered to fix bugs without some sort of event. While their shell of a publiser is reporting record profits, they turn the community acting as if all they want in the world is to make a better game, claiming poverty and a need for new revenue streams to keep their dream alive. All that -after- having the Hype Train event which was little more than a fund raiser to supposedly extend the support for the game.  Either this company is outright lying to playerbase in order to cash in on what goodwill they still have, or is run so poorly that they have bleed their customers entirely dry and toss them aside the moment they are used up.  I've spent nearly 400 hours on this game playing with friends, playing solo, experimenting with builds and crazy ways of approaching heists.

I really enjoyed Payday: the Heist, and minus loving how the game played, was mostly disappointed with Payday 2 when it was first released (pre-ordered it). There wasn't that much content. They promised that they'd be updating the game for years to come so I wasn't worried about it, but the amount of PAY updates is insane for how base this game was when it came out. I paid like $40 for it at the beginning (I was a sucker, cause later it went on sale for nothing), but how much do I gotta put into this thing?  A lot apparently.  I have almost all (if not all?) the DLCs (granted, most of them were gifted to me -- but I feel bad that someone out there paid for them). Most of the DLCs are complete ♥♥♥♥. If you're going to come out with such a puny game, Overkill, why make it so expensive to play? From the getgo I feel like I was cheated out of the game I originally paid for.  Then they announced that there was going to be a female hesiter, and I lost my ♥♥♥♥. As a chick, yeah, I enjoy playing ladies in games. This is after they came out with the Hoxton character pack (for free). When the Hoxton Breakout heist and character came back, my faith in Overkill was (somewhat) restored. Great heist, free content, good EXP -- thank you so much Overkill this is what I was expected! And pretty soon I was going to get to play a lass, and that was exciting for me. But then it was announced that my ability to play as a girl was going to be a $5 DLC. WHAT. ♥♥♥♥. And I paid for it too, just for the novelty of getting to be a girl in the game. This is when I lost aaaaall faith that they'd redeem themselves for me. The issue of making a character pay2play is -- only 1 of each character is allowed in a game. The amount of times I've joined a game and Clover was already taken, meaning the whole reason I bought the DLC was unusable to me, was so frustrating. I'm a very particular gamer -- I don't like change, be it a flaw in my makeup or whatnot...but if I pay money because I want to be a specific character, and if I can't, that's really bothersome for me.  Fast forward to me picking this game up sporadically because I have friends who really love it. My love can't be that great because at this point, I don't feel comfortable supporting Overkill and their money-grubby DLC decisions. I will stress -- this game CAN be really fun and challenging. I've played in heists that I felt were really rewarding when I finished them, and I've enjoyed improving over how many hundreds of hours of gameplay I've accumulated. But is it worth it? Not really.  The fun doesn't last, in my opinion. This game gets so repetitive so fast, I feel like I've played each heist 10x more than I'd ever want to. The locations get old. I have friends with thousands of hours of play in this game and I don't know how that's possible -- for me, even after going on hiatus after hiatus, coming back to the game I still feel the 'ugh, not this one again' fatigue of the game.   But fast forward again to this microtransactions fiasco... and hooooo  I called it.  I've been ♥♥♥♥♥ing about Overkill being a greedy company for so long, and it just proves it. Even my friends who have defended them when I've complained about the number of $5 DLCs have agreed -- that this is just crap. It makes me happy to see the community turn on them, because unless they get the message then I only see it escalating. I thought Crimefest was supposed to be about rewarding their players, and they give us microtransactions like 'there you go, I hope you're proud of what you've unlocked'?  Nah. Overkill... you need to stop. Seriously. Your game isn't great enough to crap on your entire community like this.  Even before the microtransactions, I'd find it really hard to recommend this game, despite the fun I've had playing it (just because the base game is so weak, and I can't in good conscience recommend someone buy a game and then 5+ DLCs to make it playable). But the microtransactions is the nail in the coffin.  Don't buy this game. Overkill doesn't respect you, and will do anything to bleed as much money out of you. Give your money to someone else.",

While I'm not a fan of skins with stats or skins in general and that I'll never personally open a safe, this was the worst way to apply such a thing. Adding Microtransations after saying they wouldn't during a FREE community event is having your cake and eating it all in front of the child who's birthday it was for. Plus they 'Rebalance' the weapon system. It wasn't a perfect balance to begin with, but now it's like someone put concrete blocks on the scale.   Pre-Update some weapons were under performing here and there, and a lot of DLC gear over performing it. But they were all usable. Now even with every DLC and MOD available some weapons are completely unusable. But why would I use them at all? Now I can make everything pointlessly easy by using a maxed and skinless Crosskill and AK. I'd say 86% of my inventory will now rot, but what about new players? I can't even guess how they would be enticed by this game without MODs to start them off, DLC or otherwise to make the default weapons usable.  As someone who bought every piece of DLC for this game and used all the weapons in their prime, this is far more unbalanced then it was before. Oh and as for Skin stat boosts? It's part of the greed. When people like me aren't enough who buy all of Overpriced Softwares DLC, they bring out these bias Microtransactions. To me, I don't care if you buy their game, their DLC or their drills. It's just enticing them do be more Greedy and treat us worse because of it. If this was the only way for them to keep supporting this game for another couple years then I'd have been in the L4D camp. Let it not be updated but played regardless.  I would not recommend this game honestly, at all. Buy it for £3 on sale, see how much money they want to ring out of your wallet and then go do something else. If you want to drop a bunch of money on a still poorly net synchronised game under a greedy company, be my guest. I'll keep playing it, but only because of the investment made thus far.",

It feels different, believe me. 3) New heist, more stealth heists, they are awesome, and you never get boring (almost never), 4) Let's see, new desigh: chooshing everything you can, even upgrading masks and weapons (actually, PayDay: The Heist had something like upgrading weapons but it was stupid, only for leveling up), lots of masks, bla bla bla. 5) New difficulty: Death Wish, it is ♥♥♥♥ing hardcore, though when you grow up to 100th level, you won't think that way xD. 6) I like new skill system, you can choose what you want and all that, the first part did not have such a thing. Now I don't even know what to say any more, but about performance: You do not need to have such a powerful PC, just no need for that. But sometimes you can have drop FPS on maps like Firestarter and Rats (Those are the farming maps for XP and money btw) I can now rate it: 10/10, I can't lower it, it is awesome, much better than PayDay: The Heist.",

I'm a personal fan of co-op games, like Evolve and Left 4 Dead 2. But what I think has ruined this game, is the microtransactions. I've been off this game since March of 2015, and started playing it again December 2015. I came back to be greeted by dozens of hackers in lobbies, essentially ruining the gameplay experience for me, so I have to leave and find a new game without a hacker. A game that is $20 That has $120 of DLC (As of December 17/12/1015) Has NO justification of adding in microtransactions, that BOOST your stats. Like what the ♥♥♥♥ Overkill? Other games have the justification to do it, like Team Fortress 2 has cosmetics/Weapon skins you can buy OPTIONALLY, and they provide nothing more then looking cooler, that's IT, but when you restrict a player from unlocking weapons in a game? For shame. The game isn't complete without the DLC, which makes it all up to $140 for a SINGLE game. I still really think this game is awesome, but I just can't believe that they would to this. Why in the hell would you keep trying to milk money out of us? YOU HAVE $120 WORTH OF ♥♥♥♥ING DLC! 10x THE ORIGINAL PRICE OF THE GAME! WHY WOULD YOU ADD IN SKINS THAT BOOST YOUR STATS?! It's ♥♥♥♥ing beyond me. One of the characters in the game isn't even accesible in some regions. I live in Australia, and can't get Jacket, because Hotline Miami 2 isn't available in Australia. Oh, and on the topic of other characters in this game, Jacket and John Wick are basically walking advertisements. What has Jacket got anything to do with robbing banks? John Wick's a heister now? This game just makes me angry with the decisions they've made. And it's not going to stop. The DLC will keep rolling in. Who knows what ♥♥♥♥ing cash grab they'll pull of next? 'Oh, looks like you want to join your friends game. That DLC will cost you $10. Proceed to checkout?' And what makes me sad, is that people will keep buying the DLC, and Overkill will keep making more, and it will just keep going. The only way to make them stop is to stop encouraging them.

In Payday we take the role of 8 heisters who pull of huge heists in Washington. So how is Payday 2 ? I have to say this game is horrible and people will hate this review and thats fine by me because this my opinion. Payday is no where near as fun as the first game and this one feels kinda lame to be honest. The heist range from robbing banks to cooking meth and stuff like that but they dont feel no where near as fun as the heist in Payday the heist. The game is buggy. Theres too many bugs to list here. The game is also plauged with cheaters and Overkill arent dealing with this situation. The Net code to the game is atrocious. Many of my friends couldnt connect to me or vice versa. But its not all negative. The game is fun with friends and some of the heists are really fun. The soundtrack is beyond amazing and to this day its one of my favourite gaming soundtracks. But there is one thing i wanted to talk about and thats the dlcs. The best content for the game is locked away as DLC. The most fun heists and the best weapons are dlcs. I would understand if that they have to make a living but milking all of the money from dlc is not the way to do it. Overall Payday is a fun game but over the years i lost the trust in Overkill so i cant recommend Payday 2 at all. I give Payday 2 a 5/10",

It was a wonderful co-op FPS game with RPG elements that has been utterly ruined by greed, bad communication and worse management.

Sure, they released a lot of DLC, especially for a buy-to-play game, but I bought it, because I wanted to support the company and I felt they had earned my money. I certainly got a lot of enjoyment out of it.   But requiring the playerbase to complete challenges to unlock supposedly 'free' content, only to turn around and have the leading features of the Crimefest event be microtransactions to gamble for skins that add stats, the same day they add a 'weapon rebalance' that gutted half the weapons in the game and made them nigh-unusable was a horrible move.   The fact that people have been clamoring for a weapon rebalance for literal years now with complete radio silence only made that worse.   The playerbase should NOT have to pay real money to gamble for a chance at a skin that might restore some of the stats they lost from their weapons with the weapon 'rebalance'. Period. End of story.   Especially not in a buy to pay game that, over the past year, has gotten less and less free content (something they pride themselves on) and more and more monthly DLC packs. DLC Packs with weapons and mods that were all hit incredibly hard by the weapon rebalance.   The addition of the Vault/Drill microtransactions as part of the 'free content' in Crimefest 2015 is the last straw for me. They will no longer be getting my business, I will no longer be recommending the game to my friends, and I sincerely hope that anyone that reads this review will not contribute player numbers to a game that Overkill seems determined to drive into the ground.

Alos, how do we not knmow that the RNG is rigged against us? For all we know, the system is rigged to drop us 1 drill for every 10 safes or something stupid like that. You should also know that the microtransactions are still there, and you can still buy the drills.  The verdict: stay away, give your money to games and developers that deserve it. Overkill have bitten the hands that fed them, so let's not feed them anymore.  [UPDATE 2] So uhm, they made the microtransactions even more terrible by adding a cash and XP boost.

In addition to being broken at the time of writing (a bug introduced two weeks ago which caused crashing has not been fixed, only a workaround with disables some non-essential functionality has been brought in), the game also has a horrific amount of dull DLC which brings nothing new to the formula. Frequent poor communication with the fanbase over major issues, and TF2-like safes and drills to unlock weapon skins, and no workshop support make Payday 2's experience depressing not because it's a truly bad game, but because it's the simple things that stop it from being a well supported experience.  My advice: buy it in a sale, buy the DLC in a sale, and don't take it too seriously because the returns don't match the effort.

Whether I could only play for an hour or I had all day, I almost always found myself playing it. However, over the past few months that has changed. Yes, PAYDAY 2 has had a ton of DLC over the years. Most of which have all been very well made and well worth the prices they ask for, especially when they are almost always on sale during the big Steam sales for 50% off. I was more than happy to support the developers that I felt had the community's best interests in mind. That all changed almost overnight.   From a business standpoint, it makes sense to add micro-transactions. They're completely optional, and if done right they do not change gameplay in any way besides cosmetically. They can also bring you a ton of income if you have a big community. Counter-Strike Global Offensive, for example, handles micro-transactions perfectly. When they're handled right, they're good in both a business and consumer standpoint.   This, unfortunately, is not the case with PAYDAY 2. They decided it'd be a good idea to add a similar system of micro-transactions that CS:GO has, but the weapons obtained from the crates would have stat boosts for either the weapon or your team. While Overkill has admittedly switched up and made the system better, they still felt it would be nice to add them despite them saying in the past they would never add such things to their game. Adding them to the game is one thing, making them so obviously pay-to-win is another.   To add insult to injury, they released a 'Goat Simulator' DLC which is not only a major cash grab which lacks much of any content, but further progresses PAYDAY's deep descent to being nothing more than a 'meme game'.   Is PAYDAY 2 a good game overall? Absolutely. I'd also recommend it to you if you can get it when it's on sale along with a few DLC. However I have lost all faith in the developers to pump out quality content in the future after their recent actions. Based on that, I cannot leave a good review.  ",

And it's worse since the last updates).  3- Has so much DLCs that they cost 6x the game's price.  4- Has now micro-transactions.  5- Not balanced at all. Selling new guns in trillions of DLCs does not allow you to make them totally useless or overpowered compared to other weapons.  That game is slowly but very surely becoming a big joke. Don't buy it, don't support such an attitude toward gamers.  Even though I've had very good times playing this game, I'm still very sad to see what the developers have made of it.

The community is in outrage, and it probably isn't a good time to get involved with the game until things have been resolved. 3.) Game is heading towards Pay to Win (so please don't support this decision by paying into the game right now). 4.) OVERKILL ( - a Starbreeze Studio) stated it would never go Micro-Transaction, and now has gone back on their word. Trust for this company is at an all time low as of recently.  Long Version:  This game WAS great. I mean, you had to work as a team, co-ordinate and rely on team mates. Had the ability to upgrade your guns, and the best part, it still had player skill factored into how well a person played. Just cause you owned a powerful weapon, did not mean you were the most powerful player on your team.  However, recently, the game updated to allow microtransactions. Now, I am not against microtransactions in general, but for this game, the developers said they'd never go that route. So now, the company behind it OVERKILL - a Starbreeze Studio, has officially lied to those of us who bought the game before this update. The second issue, I AM against microtransactions that change anything beyond the cosmetic functionality of a game. And in this case, the gun skins in the safes you have to pay real money for to open in the game, they add stats to the weapons.   Lastly, the game has suffered a horrid re-balance of its weapons. Many of the weapons which needed to be buffed, were nerfed (shotguns), and some weapons which didn't need a major re-balance, were (Pistols). So now the gameplay of weaponry is way off.",

I have some 750 hours in here. I had fun with this. But I cannot rightfully recommend anybody support this sort of behavior. There's plenty to support that, too. I bought a good majority of the absolute boatload of DLC that's been hammered out for this. Looking back at all the weapon packs, this has to be the most egregious case of power creep I've ever seen in a PVE game. They exist almost purely as a pay to win mechanic that can simply invalidate the threat of some special enemies. But the microtransactions are just insulting, a bid to try and cash in on TF2 and CS:GO type models when there's already some $100 of DLC past purchase price.

He started to grow.  I'd take him to the park, I made so many new friends that also had dogs. We'd meet up and let the dogs play with each other while we conversed.  The dog continued to grow. He started to need more food. I had no problem with that, he was my dog after all. Damn, food is expensive for such a hungry dog.  I'd buy him a toy every now and then. He'd play with them for a bit, then go back to his other toys. He had some toys he preferred more than others.  I'd go on vacation once in a while. When I'd get back, I was so happy to see my dog he was so happy to see me.  The dog got older. He got slower and more lethargic. He didn't have as much energy as my friends' dogs.  The medical bills began to grow. I paid for them because I loved my dog.  It reached the point where it was nothing but bill after bill after bill. I still paid for them, but it was getting hard to see my dog like this.  It was painful, but I finally made the decision to put the dog down.   Thank you Overkill, for the fun. But all good things come to an end, regardless of how painful the circumstances.",

Which, I suppose, makes writing this all the more difficult.   Watching the game go down this path is painful, to say the least. Imagine a grandparent, slowly succumbing to dementia. You know it's not going to stop, that it'll ultimately get worse and worse until its inevitable death. That is the feeling i get from this game.  Payday 2, as a game, is a very solid co-op fps. Guns feel nice, and it doesn't look like last week's mexican take-out come back to haunt me. The maps vary in quality (There are more than a few maps that are essentially clones), but they are relatively enjoyable.  But here is where the true ♥♥♥♥ness lies. Two words. Or one word? Or a compound word? Whatever it is, it's Microtransactions. Now, to say the microtransactions are the only glaring issue wouldn't be right. But it's the biggest issue. A while back, i forget when exactly, the devs said that there'd be no microtransactions. Even going so far as to say 'shame on you' to those who thought otherwise.   And what do you know? Here they be. And ♥♥♥♥ they be. They took a page from the book of CS:GO. Lo and behold, weapon skins, which themselves I don't care about. But they did something vile: stat boosts. The weapon skins have stat boosts. To be fair, they can now be obtained for free,  but good ♥♥♥♥in luck with that.    And you know what's just great? Even if you pay for the key, you may still need to pay more! That's right, not only would you need to spend $2.50, but if you get a weapon skin for a DLC weapon, you get to pay for the relevant DLC pack if you ever intend on using it!   And whjat would a Payday 2 review be without mentioning that DLC! Sure, you can play any of the DLC heists provided somebody invites you, but if you want to access the sniper rifle, rocket launcher, or grenade launcher weapons, you'll be shelling out a bit of cash. And they pump those suckers out every other month it seems, so you'll have quite the choice in what you'll be spending your hard-earned cash on. Of course, this was an issue long before the weapon skins, but the weapons add the moldy cherry on top of this rotten fish and coffee ground sundae.  I'm honestly more disappointed in this than I have been for any other game. I loved this game. I had so much fun, but now? I can't say I could ever recommend it. Let's say they remove the skins, the stat boosts, I couldn't ever trust the developers again. The lying, the moneygrubbing, it's left a bad taste I feel can never be washed out.",

Payday 2 is an interesting game, this review won't be ALL negative, but MOSTLY negative. The voice acting is superb, the characters all have their own individal personalities, for example Hoxton is a more angered and foul mouthed person, compared to someone like Chains, who is more determined and focused in personality. The gameplay offered, initially, is fun, but tedious. It seems like the same cycle for every heist you do, run in, control civs, use drill which takes ages and cannot be upgraded in any way I might add, very unusual for bank robbers who can literally get 11 million in one heist operation, but, moving on, the cops come in, you shoot them, they shoot you, bang bang, evac comes in, and then the mission MAY end, as there might be an extra cop shooting ambush level, but anyway, thats it.  My Main issue with this game is the devs incapability to fix the bugs in the game or fix gameplay irregularities as it were, some of these bugs have been there SINCE RELEASE. Here are some examples; - The police or Civs notice you and get alerted through walls - Police or civs can walk through walls - Some guards (this was in the Shadow Raid Mission for me) are seen flying into the air and then ending up somewhere by randomly teleporting somewhere else  A main gripe I have with this game are the AI heist members incapability to carry bags in the heists, this was a feature in the first game, I hardly see it impossible to implement it into this game, also, the weapons are HEAVILY unbalanced, you can literally buy a DLC and that's it! You've won the game! This is always the case for this game, but I'll get into that in a bit...  Now, I recently viewed the updates for this game, I quit playing this out of frustration for the way the Devs were handling things. Their constant additions of high priced DLCs with content that DOES NOT match the prices, you can literally complete a £5.99 heist in less than an hour, really Overkill? Pull yourselves together. This game has so much potential to be a unique, awesome, fun, engaging game, but your constant need to charge us for overpriced DLCs are letting you guys down.  Recently Overkill you are in a lot of trouble now, as Almir had specifically stated, that there would be no Microtransactions, and it would be absurd to suggest such a thing, but was he speaking truth? Haha nope. You went and added a cheap knockoff carbon copy of the weapon crates and skins system from CS:GO and TF2. That's how you value us? You're forgetting that without us, the players, your product would've failed halfway through the year of release. Shame on you guys.  Almir this is a message directly to you. You are dragging this game into the dirt, I've heard rumours it will go F2P, and if that is the truth, which I can only assume is the case, then I can only say you only will have yourself to blame for this, cause there'll come a time when your game, which used to be so popular, will fade away, and gradually become irrelevant in the Gaming community.  EDIT: I've now seen reports that comments on their community posts are getting removed, again, that's how you see all of us isn't it? Instead of lying to us and constantly acting like everything is ok, when it clearly is not, how about you evaluate the situation here? Since Crimefest 2014 and the Xmas heist, you've been releasing tons of DLC, for large prices, and for little content. You then state EXPLICITLY, that there will be no Microtransactions, a day after, lo and behold! MICROTRANSACTIONS. I wonder why so many people are posting the Middle finger and wishing your company died? Oh yeah! Cause you view your consumers-AHEM, sorry... 'Fanbase' as your primary concern...

Oh, and said skins have a RNG chance of adding stats to weapons with absolutely no drawbacks. Not to mention the so-called 'rebalance' update which made pistols more powerful than shotguns.

Couldn't do the former, didn't really do the latter.   It would appear that Overkill (who apparently lost the rights to the IP at some point) recently re-aquired them and removed the much despised micro-transactions. So it's good that they seem to at least listen to the community in that regard.   Yeah, the base game mechanics are solid, but there are better fps's out there than this. The story and characters are boring, stealth is hilariously broken, leveling up is grindy as hell, and don't even get me started on the business model. Again, microtransactions are gone, but the DLC is hilariously overpriced compared to what you get out of it.   Feel free to get yourself another opinion from someone who has spent more time with the game than I have.  Maybe they know something about the game that I don't.  All I can say is that I wish I had played the game for less time, that way I may have gotten a refund. All-in-all, I was not impressed by what this game had to offer.

Not that I recomend the game in the least as of recently. Dropping a bombshell of a feature day one, dissapearing without a word. Leaving unpaid moderators to have to deal with a community up in arms over something that shouldnt have happened. These arent people working on this game any more, its greed. Be the motives of shareholders as some have mentioned or be it their own actions, either way I cannot forgive them for killing this game. They have hurt the game, they have hurt their reputation and worst of all they have hurt the community that took so much of their abuse over the years.

However, I am pretty happy that it doesn't because in October I believe, Overkill added pay to win microtransactions to the game, after specifically saying that they would NEVER add them. These weapon skins are a crappy ripoff of the CS:GO ones, as rather than just giving your gun a neat skin, it makes it overpowered. Apparently they did this to counter their weapon balance patch, which made all guns pretty crap. That is NOT OKAY. Of course, Overkill did address this slightly by making the skins have a chance to drop, but that's not helping.  Recently, they released a DLC pack that is Goat SImulator themed. My question: why? That is perhaps the stupidest heist they have ever released as a DLC pack.  I am ashamed that I recommended this to friends back in the day. If the game was still in it's former glory, then I would love to get it fixed and return, but no. If you want to play a Payday game, then play the original, titled Payday: The Heist.

Dodge isnt broken anymore, using armor works well. Many weapons. ♥♥♥♥♥in soundtrack. Microtransactions... WAIT WHAT yes, microtransactions. As of the most recent update at the time review, at the start of crimefest 2015, OVK software released the black market patch which adds a CSGO style skin system to the game. You get 'safes' from card drops, and buy 'drills' to open them. You then get a skin, here is the kicker  the skins give you stat increases  Problem 1: OVK stated in many press releases that microtransactions would NEVER be in Payday 2 Problem 2: They released microtransactions when they are already pumping out 5 dollar DLC monthly for a game you already have to pay to play. Problem 3: DLC can have a crippling effect on gameplay, for example most DLC contain weapons. Some weapons are inherently better than 'vanilla' counterparts. Certain DLC's give you access to weapon mods that without said mods, certain vanilla weapons are practically useless. DLC also gives access to perk decks like Grinder, regarded as one of the strongest in the game, but if you dont have the DLC you are boned. Problem 4: They actually copied CSGO skin system, like 100% absolutely no originality in the design. Problem 5: THE SKINS HAVE ♥♥♥♥ING STATS. Payday 2 was bordering on P2W, now its over that line, over.

Wanna use a machine gun? DLC   Wanna use any other decent weapon that actually feels different from the others? you guessed it right: DLC  And if it wasn't enough, they made it even worse with the crimefest update . Now after some missions there's a random chance you'll get a random safe contaning random weapons that you probably already have (specially if you paid for the damned dlcs) with just different skins and with some buffs. Now guess what? YOU DON'T DESERVE IT FILTHY PEASANT, UNLESS YOU SPEND MORE MONEY!! ---&gt; In order to open said safes, you must purchase drills trough micro transactions, as if the dlcs aren't enough.  TL;DR   [+] Fun coop   [+] Stable and well optimized with a reliable netcode   [-] Pay2win with excessive and abusive dlcs + microtransactions since crimefest (which is a double backstab considering Overkill broke their word about never implementing microtransactions into the game).

However with the increasingly hostile buisness practices from the developer I find that I can no longer endorese it. Over time they have steadily released more overpriced DLC and used increasingly shady marketing campaigns to tempt players into buying said DLC. Although there has long been issues with weapon balance, the recent introduction of microtransactions, something they promised they wouldn't do, with blatant pay to win consequences has made me finally lose the rest of my dwindling faith in the company. This used to be a great game, but I cannot reccomend giving more money to a company that lies and breaks its promises and shamelessly continues trying to squeeze more money out of their loyal fans.   Update:  I should say something: This is game is fun (or at least it used to be, I haven't played it in about a year, when I originally made this review). I enjoyed playing it. My problem is mainly with the developer and how they are monitizing the game. I have been told the microtransactions have been told back, but as I haven't played the game recently, I can't say how the current ingame situation compares to when I used to play.  What I can say though, is that the developers has still not made a propper apology. They have realeased several statements claiming to be apologies, but none of these have actually made any admision of wrongdoing on their side or implied that they ever had anything but the game's best interests at heart. If you feel the need to preface you apology with justifications, it is not a true apology. Nor have they ever aknowledged that the microtransactions were not an insolated incident, but the culmination of a series of increasingly exploitative buisness practices. Until the company actually adress these issues, I refuse to hand over any more money to them, and urge other people to not do either.",

Sadly, both the developers and the community are in such a toxic state right now that this is unplayable.  I got this game during the free week, played it amongst a myriad of other new players and I loved it. After that, I decided to buy it. I had to buy the GOTY edition since the sheer amount of DLC meant that I was missing on 70% of the content otherwise (which should never happen ever. Developers, this is a good way to tell if your business model is appropriate). I made a few friends during the free week and couldn't wait to play with them.  Upon firing the game, after going through the basic tutorial (and after being shoved in your face how awesome the new DLC pack is, through a cutscene) you'll be greeted with the possibility of customizing your gear. 70% of the weapons will be behind paid DLC walls and some other guns will become available once you join the Payday 2 community... This is the equivalent of a clickbait title on a Youtube video, to put it some way. You can still play the game without DLC, but you won't be able to even do some heists. Plus, any new weapon customization you want must be acquired through random drops after every heist.  Let's skip all of that and say that you join a game. Even as a Lv. 1 player, assuming that you don't get kicked instantly, you are expected to know to perfection the most efficient way of doing the heist and the most efficient gear to bring. If you don't, you'll be subject to being cursed, insulted and kicked. Possible death treats are also a thing.  'Well, surely that's something that happens everywhere when you play with randoms' well, no... This community has gone so down that even playing with some of the guys that joined during said free week, those 'friends' of mine, has gotten me a barrage of insults after I brought one piece of kit that wasn't adequate for the heist in question.  On top of that, now you can pay microtransactions to get some new stuff.  I really wanted to love this game, I wanted to have some fun time heisting, killing cops, taking civilians, succeding and failing at it. Sadly, it looks like failing isn't an option, or underperforming at all.

            "review_text": "Alright, I deleted my previous review, to type out a new one in place of it for the ♥♥♥♥♥torm that is the Hoxton's Housewarming Party event. So everyone knows they added new difficulties, Mayhem (which comes after Overkill and before Death Wish), and One Down (the most difficult of all the difficulties). Now, I like that they are still adding more to the game after all this time. Overkill listens to their fanbase for the game. What makes me not recommend this is how it seems like NOTHING is ever playtested. The new difficulties are difficult as hell, but not because of smart A.I. or advanced tactics, but because of enemies gaining a HUGE increase in health and damage. This mainly affects Mayhem, Death Wish, and One Down (especially One Down). Mayhem is like a mini Death Wish, not as difficult as Death Wish, but harder than Overkill. HOWEVER, it is extremely difficult to kill even the basic assault wave enemies without going for the overpowered skills, which right now are the converting skills such as Joker Aced and Partner in Crime Aced, which make converted cops extremely difficult to kill, allowing them to act as bullet shields for you. Converted cops can take around 500 shots from enemy cops for some damn reason. Another overpowered skill is Body Expertise, which allows for a percentage of headshot damage to be applied to bodyshots. This is another part that pisses me off. Body Expertise's formula is utterly broken, allowing you to do 4x damage on bodyshots compared to 2x headshot damage on One Down. I know I was just talking about Mayhem, but for a good comparison, I had to go to One Down. One Down, the toughest difficulty in the game right now, is... unbalanced as all hell. Cops take quite a few shots to kill even with Body Expertise. Zeal Team, the new units used against you, have INSANE damage. A single Zeal Team enemy, a basic rifleman, is able to down you in around 3-5 shots from their assault rifle. Combine this with approximately 20 Zeal Team enemies at once, and you won't even get to blink before you are downed. The Zeal Dozers are especially well known for doing this, as 2 shots from them can down you no problem. I found this out AFTER I played Boiling Point on One Down, which was for the most part unchanged in difficulty from the original Death Wish difficulty for some reason. Russian mercenaries did very little damage compared to Zeal Team, even the Russian Dozers were pushovers compared to Zeal Team riflemen, and I completed Boiling Point with no issue, which caused me to be surprised by the other heists. And now, I shall state what I think is a sin. As of now, we have yet to get the new Safehouse, which was supposed to be released as an update today. It has NOT come out yet, and there is already a stream goin on waiting for the Day 3 update. It makes me somewhat livid, but as long as the Day 2 update does not come out on Day 3, then I am willing to forgive this.  Long story short, game is a mess right now, give Overkill some time to iron out the wrinkles and balance the scales. The new difficulties will be rebalanced as Overkill said at some point later, hopefully either during the Housewarming Party event, or shortly after it.",

Everyone feels that they have a part to completing the heist and can feel the success of completing it.  BUT, I do not like the way this game plays out. The heists are boring and the game really becomes reptitive. With this new system of obtaining mods and masks it really makes the game a grind to play. The Heists arent all that well planned out either. In the original Payday: The Heist (which i enjoyed a lot mind you.) The escapes in the heists are really unique. For example, First World Bank. Who would have known that you could actually blow a hole in the wall and run through the building next to it? Heists in the original Payday brings in much more unique-ness and really makes the heists feel that were really really planned out. Payday 2's heists are like, Grab and dash to the van/helicopter. Even with the new 'DLC', the Armored Transport heists arent really that fun to play in the first place. Rob a bunch of vans and getting out in the van at the corner alive. Thats about it. I was really excited for the game's release but it has let me down with poorly planned heists and boring reptitive means of progression. Its a good game, but the quality of content isnt really that special.",

You used to be amazing, just the thought of a 4 man crew against an entire SWAT unit, wave after wave, it was really addicting and really fun. I loved the Heist, had so much fun with each level, First World Bank, and the level system, and each character felt like they had personallity. Maybe it's just me but to me this game used to feel like it was going somewhere like a slight story or something. You have these heisters raiding places, nothing can stop them, and then Payday 2 happened. I loved Payday 2, to me it had most of what Payday The Heist had to make it great, but even more stuff, more masks, new heisters, decks, new level system. I loved to play as John Wick, and I used to love the dlc for this game, I'd get it for my friends and my friends would get some for me and we'd heist it out on Hoxton's Breakout.  But yeah that's all over with now. The developers of this game have proven time and time again that they just don't listen to simple feedback of their fans, it's no wonder that the community is torn apart as it is right now.     The overall design of this game is honestly quite bad, almost everything even remotely fun to do involves dlc, most of the awesome missions are dlc, oh hey want some cool weapon mods, want a bow, a sword, or a FAMAS? DLC Sniper Rifle? DLC. GRENADES? DLC (CARDS ARE NOT GRENADES, QUIT FOOLING YOURSELVES)  I can understand having dlc, but you can't just make everything dlc, you can't just charge and charge without fixing and making the game work, the ai is horrible, in the first game I'd argue it was better than L4D2 AI. in this game the ai is likely to get you killed not picking you up because an enemy is next to you or something. The game is just terribly optimized, every dlc one after the other just outdoes and makes the other less useful statwise, unrealistic gun mechanics, nerfing nearly all shotguns, buffing pistols and then NERFING THEM TOO. just really stupid. A lot of assault rifles have been nerfed as well.  Microtransactions as a reward for us participating in their community events, that give stat boosting skins to guns, that you have to pay real money for good ones.   Complete lack of integrity from devs, and I'm sorry to say it, I wish this game would be amazing again.   IN short Payday has become a game that has no identity anymore, it's all about making money for Overkill and advertisements for other games and movies, Payday isn't Payday, it's not anything now.  OH AND I LEFT OUT THE MOST DAMNING PROOF OF THIS:  -Overkill promised no microtransactions  -Overkill promised to give users something special with care and love put into it for those who bought the 20 dollar completely overkill pack  -What we got for purchasing this, the nice masks, but we also got random loot drops for microtransactions, I have statistically about a 1/50 chance of getting anything good, and 50/1 chance of getting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skin stat wise for a gun I don't even use, and I got a BROKEN IN FLAMETHROWER SKIN, guys, Is that love? Broken in is terrible stat wise, and not only that, You promised us something nice, what if I wanted something else? WHAT IF I WANTED A FAMAS SKIN?   -Overkill's solution to this problem is to keep doing the same ♥♥♥♥ and offer some glowing masks to us. Cool, cool, but that's not fixing my gun skin guys. :D Nice try trying to rip us off again, just another cosmetic, goodbye Overkill.",

Gun balance: Okay the guns are unbalanced to the point where more than half the guns are useless, instead of adding more content i would suggest buffing the guns that need it and nerfing the guns that need it 2. Skins: These things need to be cosmetic because its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that these things give stats that makes top tier guns more DW viable and RNG safes (which can be averted with the black market but thats no excuse) Where you might get a random skin for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun i guess. also make the safes cost alot less to open 3. bugfixes: this game has alot of bugs and ill just name one of them Hoxton breakout captain winters will sometimes not despawn the captain wave even after you defeated him 4. A loyalty system: we need a system that can actually hook players to the game without sucking their wallet earn2win i should say this system would be if you complete heists on OK or DW difficulty you get loyalty points which can be used to buy exclusive masks patterns and colors as well as Drills for safes.  And last but not least 5. Buff the low tier perkdecks: These perkdecks armorer, crew chief, crook, etc have been really really bad and not viable at all on DW difficulty or any other difficulty for that matter because there were so many better perkdecks out there and maniac has literally thrown crew chief and gambler in the trash when it comes to team support  So in a sense I would like overkill to read this review and i may post this on the payday 2 community forums so almir can listen to these problems I may not have 1000+ hours into this game and XXV infamy but i have a general idea for how overkill may be able to fix its game.",

It's not like, *pay this* and *get that*. No. It's *pay this* and you *MIGHT get that*. It's basically gambling and they take your money no matter what you end up with.  Thanks to their blatant lying and corporate-greed level business practices, I'll never buy any property these developers ever touch.  -3/10. Want my 28.5 hours back.",

And the last few months I went from playing all the time to none at all. And now... I booted it up today and it feels really...cheap. Like a mobile game cheap.   The anticipation is gone.

You used to be amazing, just the thought of a 4 man crew against an entire SWAT unit, wave after wave, it was really addicting and really fun. I loved the Heist, had so much fun with each level, First World Bank, and the level system, and each character felt like they had personallity. Maybe it's just me but to me this game used to feel like it was going somewhere like a slight story or something. You have these heisters raiding places, nothing can stop them, and then Payday 2 happened. I loved Payday 2, to me it had most of what Payday The Heist had to make it great, but even more stuff, more masks, new heisters, decks, new level system. I loved to play as John Wick, and I used to love the dlc for this game, I'd get it for my friends and my friends would get some for me and we'd heist it out on Hoxton's Breakout.  But yeah that's all over with now. The developers of this game have proven time and time again that they just don't listen to simple feedback of their fans, it's no wonder that the community is torn apart as it is right now.     The overall design of this game is honestly quite bad, almost everything even remotely fun to do involves dlc, most of the awesome missions are dlc, oh hey want some cool weapon mods, want a bow, a sword, or a FAMAS? DLC Sniper Rifle? DLC. GRENADES? DLC (CARDS ARE NOT GRENADES, QUIT FOOLING YOURSELVES)  I can understand having dlc, but you can't just make everything dlc, you can't just charge and charge without fixing and making the game work, the ai is horrible, in the first game I'd argue it was better than L4D2 AI. in this game the ai is likely to get you killed not picking you up because an enemy is next to you or something. The game is just terribly optimized, every dlc one after the other just outdoes and makes the other less useful statwise, unrealistic gun mechanics, nerfing nearly all shotguns, buffing pistols and then NERFING THEM TOO. just really stupid. A lot of assault rifles have been nerfed as well.  Microtransactions as a reward for us participating in their community events, that give stat boosting skins to guns, that you have to pay real money for good ones.   Complete lack of integrity from devs, and I'm sorry to say it, I wish this game would be amazing again.   IN short Payday has become a game that has no identity anymore, it's all about making money for Overkill and advertisements for other games and movies, Payday isn't Payday, it's not anything now.  OH AND I LEFT OUT THE MOST DAMNING PROOF OF THIS:  -Overkill promised no microtransactions  -Overkill promised to give users something special with care and love put into it for those who bought the 20 dollar completely overkill pack  -What we got for purchasing this, the nice masks, but we also got random loot drops for microtransactions, I have statistically about a 1/50 chance of getting anything good, and 50/1 chance of getting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skin stat wise for a gun I don't even use, and I got a BROKEN IN FLAMETHROWER SKIN, guys, Is that love? Broken in is terrible stat wise, and not only that, You promised us something nice, what if I wanted something else? WHAT IF I WANTED A FAMAS SKIN?   -Overkill's solution to this problem is to keep doing the same ♥♥♥♥ and offer some glowing masks to us. Cool, cool, but that's not fixing my gun skin guys. :D Nice try trying to rip us off again, just another cosmetic, goodbye Overkill.",

Like everyone said they lied to their community telling us we will never see microtransactions in Payday ever , well guess what they just added microtransactions. I won't go into much details about the microtransactions since most of the bad reviews around now explain the whole problem.  Also there is way too much DLCs , i know they are optional but most of the time DLCs mean better weapons than what you have or simply a new set of weapon that you don't have at all in the game i.e : Snipers , you don't have access to a single one in the base game you have to buy a DLC to unlock a couple of them ( there's more in other DLCs of course they aren't all in the same one ). Right now there's 36 , yes 36 DLCs including a soundtrack. That is absurd.  I still think the game is very fun to play , the problem here is the numbers of DLCs and the new addition of microtransactions ( Which increase your stats it's not a simple skin ). But if you have a lot of money to throw at a company that doesn't deserve it anymore and you are looking for a very fun wave/shooter game this is the game for you. But for me it's not anymore.",

            "review_text": "The Sims of shooters.  The game builds on a simple set of well-designed fundamentals. And even though this is what makes the game so fun, it's also what limits it from being something better. The content that comes out has little diversity, and you can be pretty sure that in any DLC that comes out, the content in it is limited to two sets of things: guns and masks, or a heist, guns and masks. This means that even if Overkill makes new content for months to come, you'll eventually run tired of the repetitve gameplay.  It would seem that Overkill's solution to the above problem is to redefine the PAYDAY 2 formula every now and then. Monthly core gameplay overhauls aren't unusual, and while they do contribute in keeping things fresh, they eventually become extremely tiring. Having to learn the game you've already spent hundreds of hours on all over isn't fun.  The only redeeming quality of the game in its current state is its incredible sound design. PAYDAY 2 set a new standard for sound design when it released, and I'd say it still rocks the throne. The gun sounds are amazing and really help with the immersion, and the voice acting is great. The absolutely best part, however, is the soundtrack. It is easily one of the best I've heard in a very, very long time. Sadly, Simon Viklund, who was responsible for the soundtrack, left Overkill a while back.  The DLC is what makes this game truly disappointing, though. Thumbs up to Overkill for providing tons of free content, but that simply doesn't change the fact that a massive part (probably even up to half) of the game is behind a paywall. I won't comment on the recently included microtransactions beyond how I believe it to be another step in the wrong direction. Overkill's business practices are becoming increasingly dirtier, and the incredible contact with the community they had while they were still working on the original PAYDAY game is long gone. PAYDAY 2 has turned into The Sims of shooters.  While Overkill did a good job making a fun, enjoyable game, they've run the game into the ground. Several times. The core gameplay is constantly being altered, making it tiring to play. The countless updates have provided this game with an incredible amount of content, and although some is free, a massive part of the game's content is behind the paywall. PAYDAY 2 could be something incredible, but it turned into a sad story.",

Years later, you have a game with a relentless onslaught of lower and lower DLC quality, constant balance creep, and still no fixes for gameplay problems that have existed since day one.  And finally now, after asking the community to complete challenges for free content, after advertising the 'completely free' nature of this for literally months, after promising several times never to add microtransactions in any way (even going so far as to MOCK the person who asked the question), the first 'free' content released for the big, heavily-advertised event was a CS:GO/TF2 style case/crate system that costs $2.49 per crate to open. And inside the crates: weapon skins that improve the statistics of the guns they go on. And they 'rebalanced' the guns at the same time. And they added Steam Workshop support so they don't even have to do their own art for the skins.  There was literally not a single free thing about it.  Microtransactions are fine. Especially for a coop game, small stat-altering bonuses shouldn't have been a big deal. But the constant, blatant, unrelenting dishonesty makes clear that the developers have long since stopped caring about the game or the community, and care only about how much money they can extract from you.  There is admittedly a pretty fun game buried in this pile of increasingly poor DLC, increasingly bad grind, unfixed bugs, and increasingly poor balance, but it isn't worth supporting a company like this.  Give this one a pass at any price, with any sale. The game in its current state isn't worth letting companies like this think they will be rewarded for acting so unscrupulously.  Not recommended.",

The game plays unlike anything else I've ever played. It's your average FPS with skill trees changing how you tackle waves of police and SWAT as almost all of the 'heists' are 'loud' and the stealth ones that do exist can go sour very easily with a single slip up, which you WILL be experiencing if you play pubs.  Unlocking anything and eveything is a confusing nightmare. The game is 50% grinding the same missions and 50% RNG for getting the drops you want, like mods or masks. The heists get old very quickly and the empty 'Infamy' Mechanic pads out the boring gameplay for many more hours to come.  Despite all this, I would reccomend Payday 2, it's a game everyone should experience at least once because despite being a very cookie cutter FPS it does so many things differently and has many many layers of depth in terms of customisation. The DLC, while aggressive, is fun and usually non-neccesary. I've played up to about level 100 and I've enjoyed pretty much most of my time. Do you like games like League of Legends where rounds can last up to 40 minutes? This is the FPS equivalent. Teamwork is key, and honestly most people you will find are competent at this game enough for everyone to have a good time and make some good money doing what heisters do best: Stealing.  Don't buy all the DLC, you don't need it. Overkill are a shady company with dodgy practices and it's clear how green their horns are, they have a long way to go. Much like Gearbox, they're milking their winning series for everything they can get. But hey, at least they're trying. Few games on PC have support as good as this, come and join the fun.  The community may be a little on the young side and sometimes can be toxic, but you will make some good memories in this game.",

            "review_text": "Overkill got a little too into it and became robbers themselves, charging for stat - boosting weapon skins and essentially turning Payday 2 into a pay2win microtransaction-fest.    Edit: A Eulogy for PAYDAY 2    Overkill have gone on record stating that the stat - boosted weapon skins are here to stay. And with that, I am never playing this game again.   It's been a long time coming, what with the weekly DLC releases. 80% of the game's content is already behind a paywall. Microtransaction weapon skins are just the final nail in the coffin.   I loved OVK and PD:TH so much that I supported PAYDAY 2 before its release, pre - ordering and playing the beta. I spent countless hours with my friends throwing coke into the ocean, getting plowed by bulldozer-senpai, setting the dance floor ablaze, getting Vlad his sparkly tiara, adding HCl at the wrong time and blowing up the meth lab, and getting into all sorts of other laughable, fun situations.   At first, the updates were good and meaningful. Weapons were rebalanced, heists were fixed and added, and adjustments were made.  After a while, however, I began to feel apprehensive about the updates. OVK seemed to be putting out more and more DLC, while certain promised features went unfulfilled (safehouse customization, anyone?).  I continued to play the game, though. It was just so damn fun. I even bought some of the DLC packs, here and there. I wanted to help support a game I enjoyed so much.  Eventually, though, it got to a point where I couldn't enjoy the game anymore. OVK's already questionable business practices had devolved into some 'hype train' circlejerk which, as the name implies, involved building massive amounts of hype within the community for more hollow features while selling  special limited edition  shít overpriced DLC.  If you're going to play PAYDAY 2 in 2015, you should expect: -Microtransactions -DLC -Pay2Win game format -Lies from OVK -A community that eats all of the above out of OVK's hands -Disappointment  To be fair, OVK does provide a fair amount of free content to its players. This comes with the massive downside of joining the official PD2 group on steam, however. You'll get some admittedly nice free content in your game, but in exchange you'll have your steam activity feed spammed literally every day with NEW DLC COMING SOON or CRIMEFEST DAY 763 or BUY THIS ALIENWARE MACHINE AND GET A GLOWY MASK!!!11  I used to enjoy Payday 2 so much. I want to still like it, but I can't.   It feels hollow. Empty. Dead.  R.I.P. PAYDAY 2 goodnight sweet prince  Here's where I'd say something about OVK losing a customer, but they don't care.     They already got my money.  ",

            "review_text": "Well then, this'll be my first review so take it with a grain of salt if it lacks quality. Before you buy this game, you must make sure that you are a PATIENT person, this game CAN ♥♥♥♥ you off with the amount of weird deaths, cheaters, DLC.   DLC: This game has a lot of DLC , like, two Steam pages. This game is fun with it's DLC and the DLC are mostly worth it. If you lack money, you might want to wait for a Steam sale like the one going on right now. Anything that gets you a new weapon or a map is worth it in this game. But it will be expensive without the steam sale, that's for sure. It's a never-ending cycle of you heisting in banks and other missions and Overkill heisting in your pocket.   Combat: This is where the game gets fun, the combat is fun as you mow through the cops with your arsenal of weapons. BUT... The A.I. is not that bright, the cops will outnumber you to overwhelm you instead of outwitting you. Same goes for your friendly A.I. , they are not smart at all. Want an explosive shotgun to stun the cops and get out of a tight situation while also sniping with a shotgun or mowing everything down with a minigun (or LMG) ? That can happen with the very low price of ... Nevermind, not going for a DLCDAY joke here. Plus, according to this game, America's population is 98% SWAT units,1% civillians and 1% heisters.  Stealth: It is very rewarding but it will destroy you from the inside. Seriously, the frustration in stealth is outstanding! Detection Risk of 3 which is the lowest (best) in the game? Well, too ******* bad, everyone has eyes behind them, except you. Hell, even on top of their heads. You will be spotted for very silly reasons such as: Broken glass? CALL THE ENTIRE ARMY Heard some random drill? Oh god, they are robbing the bank even though it can be any random drill! Heard a SAW? RUUUN , SCREAM AND SHOUT, LET IT ALL OUT. (lel) Put a beard on? Shoot him/her. Call the damn Swat force. All of it. Now. Put a mask on? Shoot him/her. Call the damn Swat force. All of it. Again. Put glasses on? You got the idea. Same with hats and anything else. Saw a random gym bag? Help, they killed someone/they are robbing us! Et  cetera.  Economy/Grinding: Well, I've never had issues with money in the game and I am Infamy IV which is a high level (not that high after Infamy 2.0 came out) . Leveling is a grind indeed. But the real grinding is finding weapon parts, masks, colours, materials. So much grinding for those. If you don't play with mods, that is.  Customisation: Weapons: Lots of customisation options for every weapon. (Well, nearly every weapon, looking at you, Mosconi.) You'll need to find every damn part though, hard to get, again, grindy game is grindy. Masks: TF2 is the hat simulator. Payday 2 is the mask simulator. Masks are like Pokemon, you ''Gotta Wear Em' All!''. Some members of the community even get ideas about your skill level by looking at your mask. Silly. You can further customise your masks with patterns,materials, colours. Which requires RNG drops, which requires grinding. Yaay, grinding. No, just no.  Modding: Even though people seem to dislike modders/modding in this game, modding is what makes it better. Hud mods will help you a lot while playing on public matches where people don't communicate much most of the time. For example, Hoxhud, one of the most popular mods in the game, lets you track the amount of bags,pagers,guards,civillians, collectables that are on the current map. Plus, you get ''PushToInteract'' . Goonmod aka Goonhud , it is customisable so you can disable things in it if you want. I don't want to advertise but people mistake these mods for ''cheats''. Goonhud lets you do things like making the game harder (for fun), increase corpse count, rainbow lasers for your weapon,a trading system and it can also completely wipe-out depending on RNG. Yes, you canget mods that you want without depending on RNG. It adds a special currency in the game and stuff. Yeah, enough talking about modding.  Security... ? : Peer to peer connection, the only thing the game does against cheaters is putting a CHEATER tag on them and making them unable to play with players that don't want cheaters in their lobbies. You can play with whoever you want, cheating is okay in Payday 2 unless you use it to ruin people's experience, kill them, or brag about masks/weapons/achievements that you did not earn. Don't play with cheaters if you don't want to, play if you want, keep it fair, don't be an ******* .   Community:  Great if you find people to play with. Other than that, full of people who whine about everything in the game. Failed mission because of you? OMG YOU SUCK SO MUCH. Deathwish mask? HACKER. Overkill mask? Hacker? Came to the end of a heist? Cya, our friend is coming. *kicked before getting the rewards* You'll end up seeing lots of foreign language speakers as well.   Legend: +=good -=bad /=medium Final Verdict: COMBAT + STEALTH + ECONOMY/ COMMUNITY / SECURITY + DLC + MODDING + CUSTOMISATON + A.I. - FUN +  8/10 because of the A.I.  I highly recommend this game, you'll have lots of fun AND frustration at the same time. Message me + add me as friend if you need help with the game.   PS: Sorry for the extra long review of DLCDAY.. *cough* Payday 2. But it's a fun game worth your money and you'll get the bang for your buck. It gets repetitive if you don't get the DLC though, get it right now if you want to save on a lot of money :P",

Unbelievable but as long as people are willingly to pay for customization, CUSTOMIZATION which was once a feature that many games had for free but that now you have you pay or be at the mercy of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ item drop..as long as gamblers and rich momma boys exist, the Payday 2 community will radically change.",

            "review_text": "Is the game fun for the most part? Yeah, sure. I myself have had hour upon hours of fun playing this game with friends and I do not regret it. Good gameplay, alright community, fun heists. However, Overkill, the company that has made Payday 2 are the worst. Where do I begin? Okay lets go: Overkill does not fix their heist breaking bugs. Stealth in this game feels so rewarding not because you managed to stealth a very hard level, but because you managed to do so and not get ♥♥♥♥ed over by the constant bugs. The bugs include but are most certainly not limited to: People seeing bags through walls, people seeing hostages through walls, cops attacking me even though I'm not Chains, people hearing gunshots even if you have the perk to muffle your stuff, (mostly) guards seeing you through walls, silenced guns alerting people.   These bugs have been in the game since the release and Overkill has not fixed it. Instead they choose to make overpriced DLC rather than making their game's stealth mechanic work. Very few of the DLCs are worth buying. They want $4-$7 for heists and maybe a few masks and designs. This is crazy. The DLC weapons are almost always worse than the ones in the base game. I'd also like to add they released a new DLC almost immediatley after they released the Overkill Edition of the game, which contained all the DLC. Meaning those with the Overkill Edition of the game would have to buy more DLC if they wanted the entire experience. Collectivley, all the DLC adds up to $114 if I counted correctly.(rounded up 99 cents to $1, 6.99=7).   Here's an amusing quip. So at the end of their yearly Crimefest, Overkill's way of celebrating Payday 2's release, they decided that a good way to reward their commuinty who has taken their DLC, which adds up to more than twice the amount of the base game on release day. Their community, who defends the company when people critize it for being what it is. Their community, who only wishes they fix the bugs in the game. They decided to reward this community who has been taking it in the ♥♥♥ for years would be adding MICROTRANSACTIONS, which they promised to never add into the game during an interview a while back.  This company treats its community like trash and consider rewards something to pay for. This community, including me and my friends, will honestly be surprised when they do, on occasion, release something new that doesn't cost money. This company thinks that a 'fun' challenge to do would be following the devs boring Twitters in order to advance to the next level in Crimefest. When they realized the community wanted to play Payday 2 during Crimefest, the community manager, Almir, decided to make a passive agressive post about it.  This game has so much potential but as long as it has it's creators are holding it back that potential will remained locked, just like the crates in this game, because I'm not ♥♥♥♥ing buying them.  This community gets more robbed and abused by Overkill than Washington D.C by the Payday crew.  I am going to uninstall this game because I was a loyal fan of this game and I deserved better than 'Our gift to you is you give us money.'",

One of the only games i own that i enjoy to play both alone and with friends (lets be honest, stealth is hard when you have other people to be concerned about besides yourself). The addition of overkill approved mod HoxHud has made the game alot simpler in terms of knowing when civilians are under control, how many pagers you have left and so forth. There are the inevitable moments when guards see you behind walls or bodies are in a completely different position to how the rest of your team see them, however this is mostly removed by being the host of your lobby, or having a friend with wonderful internet.

The money became real and spendable (even though you lose most of it to an offshore account), the masks became art pieces, the guns became modular, and everything felt new and exciting. You went through your first run of every heist loving the uniqueness of the missions and hopefully enjoying it with your friends. Then you started to notice a few things were pretty similar to one another...most missions are throw bag in van then hop in van, where as opposed to the original where you had to attach a chinese guy to a plane flying by, then scuba dive away or gather blood samples from some dude in a hospital who slowly transforms into a zombie then escape in one of a few different ways while military jets shot at said hospital. But you let it fly because some are really interesting. Then you start seeing little packages pop up everywhere and think 'Wow! These are cool I wonder what they do!' So you get a dlc pack thats relatively cheap and start getting Gage upgrades. Fast forward through your first playthrough and you get infamy and just think 'Wow.....these are getting old and I'm amazing at every heist.' You've done every heist on its hardest difficulty, Bulldozers dont even make you flinch anymore when it used to make you cower in fear when someone called it out in the original. Fast forward about 2 years after the release, the game becomes a bloated dlc monster with over 40 dlcs and becomes a money maker rather than a good game. You look back at all the greatness that was the original with its fun heists, tough enemies, and unique experience that made you (hopefully) cry in laughter and fear as a great heist goes completely out the window because a bulldozer runs in and knocks down your friend and you think on your feet to get him back as bullets fly around you. Every heist made you feel like a professional robber, wearing a suit a tie and taking out cops with deadeye precision right until a shield ran in first and made you panic and run. Even though there were no more than 10 heists, every heist came at you differently and made you feel amazing. Then you come back and see whats its become...",

In conclusion if you want a game that can keep you and your friends entertained like the old days of CS Source at a LAN party then this game will deliver similar results albeit only 4 players / team or game.",

A fix that isn't really a fix and doesn't affect much but spotting? I can deal with that. I don't know if the community can though.  The stock game is a decent experience, and when the sales do come, lots of the DLCs you can purchase for a measly 99 cents, or a tad more.  There a heist you want to play, but you don't have the DLC? Ask the community in the forums.   If you want to have a good time, play with friends. Or perhaps try playing with randoms and maybe fail, but have your moments. Play it casual, or hardcore with merciless kicks to all who make one single mistake.   PAYDAY 2 in my opinion is a fun, enjoyable game. It may not be the same to you, but I like it.",

Gone are the challenges that unlock skills and weapons, skills are now bought with cash along with weapons. Weapon customisation has been added and there are a tonne of attachments to add to weapons. Weapon roster has been massively improved, currently the game holds about 40-50 different guns to choose for hiests. A huge amount of masks have been put in the game, almost 100, each with custimisation options.   If you don't own this game, then get it bought! It is a better than the first game in every single way! Recommended!!!!",

            "review_text": "Watched Sam Fisher try and jump kick a guy in an Optimus Prime mask, who countered by hitting his attacker with a barbed wire baseball bat and causing him to spaz out and get thrown out the map. I was immediately downed by an angry American guy in a bomb disposal suit, who claimed to be a wall just as another guy put a buzzsaw through his face plate and helmet. Got helped up, accidentally threw the bag of Meth I had on top of a shelf that nobody could reach and got tasered. Nobody came to help, so I got sent to prison for 3 minutes as punishment for my mass genocide of police officers.  It's OK, though, they let me out when one of my bro-bros held one of the exceedingly disposable police officers hostage and then traded me for him, because I'm worth as much as just one of the SWAT officers that died in their hundreds around our Meth lab.  So, anyway, the next day, we went to go sell drugs to some black guys in their ghetto, and the police showed up to ruin all the fun. Our immediate instinct was to find some pieces of paper before the ghetto-dwellers ate them to hide the evidence from us. The drill jammed eight times in a minute's worth of drilling, but we finally got the safe open and discovered...  Whoops!  This secure metal box is where they store their half-eaten toasted cheese sandwiches, silly us.  We found another safe, and drilled that one open, which revealed a brown folder that contained information about how some Mexican guys would be travelling on a bus to go to the airport with their fourteen suitcases containing $3,000,000 in cash, and live C4 explosives. We were ordered to go stop them, and that meant that all the cars on the bridge parked at stupid angles and blocked the bus' path. We ran up the side of the motorway bridge, and I ran onto the bus with two Deagles and shot the people. Of course, this didn't break my wrist, because I was playing as a sweary English man. The mysterious voice told me that he was sending a helicopter. The FBI didn't care that the loot helicopter showed up, though, because they were more invested in sending Sam Fisher to kick me in the face and cause me to throw $75,000 off a bridge into a river. We left the scene, and a creepy Colombia Drug Man said something about 'cartels' and 'burritos' or something, then gave us all $75,000 to make up for the money that Sam Fisher made me get rid of.  Then, we were all given $3,000,000 from the suitcases we stole from on the bus and realized that the money the guy paid us to do this was probably not worth us all being shot and tasered for, so I decided to make a mask with a Scottish theme. It looked awful, just like Edinburgh, and I was glad that I spent over $400,000 on what was basically a piece of plastic with some stripes on it.  I also helped an angry Russian man to steal a tiara so he could be the prettiest, and he started shouting '♥♥♥♥' and 'Vodka' before launching into a musical number and shouting down the phone like a ♥♥♥♥. Also, the guy from Breaking Bad was a dentist, and told me to break an English guy from prison. Naturally, I decided to wear sunglasses instead of a full-face mask to avoid people recognizing me when I walked into the FBI building and shot the place up. It worked, by the way.  Anyway, my verdict is that this is like Skyrim, but not full of breast related mods.  10/10",

Now sadly the game aparently has not been completed yet, but I feel like Overkill is trying their hardest to make this game better.

For example, if you buy the Gage sniper pack you can have better cover (sometimes) then having your teamate down with you being shot up trying to cover you.

But that company has a f*cking problem.  Overkill has repeatedly broken promises. They directly said before release 'We will not ever have microtransactions.' And last month, October 15, 2015, they added Microtransactions. This game is not Free to Play with microtransactions. This game is not cheap at all actually. This game has a reasonably priced base game with 100€ of DLC. In order to purchase this game with all DLC, you must pay 130€ outside of a sale. On top of this 130€ price tag are microtransactions. Just think about that.  Some years ago, there were a series of 'what's next' audio files hinting at something. After a *month* of daily audio files being released, it culminated in an advertisement for another game that isn't released until 2016 and an in-game baseball bat.  Next year, we had 'Crimefest,' where the top reward Overkill was to release was a mystery. This mystery ended up being John Wick. A movie tie-in they were going to make and release anyway.  Next year, some of the rewards for Crimefest were 'FBI Files' (in-game stats), and a new enemy. These weren't released until this year. The FBI files ended up being a re-implementation of a community web page, and the new enemy ended up just being a bunch of shields standing in a circle.  This year, Overkill did a 'Hype Train' event. By pre-ordering DLC, we would get 'hype-fuel' points. With enough 'hype-fuel,' rewards for the community would be unlocked. In order to boost sales, Overkill finally delivered on a promise of finishing their new prestige levels (called Infamy). The first five infamy levels provided very small gameplay benefits along with awesome in-game masks. The next 20 levels released in Infamy 2.0 provided new masks and experience point bonuses (so you can infamy....faster?). Well I'm rude, there are achievements...  I call this 'Mask Pack 2.0.' It took Overkill *14 months* to release this. In response, people started refunding their DLC pre-orders. In response to THAT, Overkill released the DLC early so no one could get refunds. The latest Hype-train reward has yet to be released. In response to this, I completely stopped buying DLC and I told all my friendlist to stop gifting me new DLC, I don't wanna support this anymore.  And most recently, Overkill added microtransactions after explicitly saying that they will NEVER do that along with intentionally breaking extremely well made community mods. Overkill does not deserve your money. They have repeatedly broken their promises and insulted the community.  Overkill, shame on you. You've truly shown that you are nothing but liars and cheats.",

            "review_text": " Note: I did not play this game at all before the big 100th update so I was not exposed to whatever problems the game had before then.    Overall, Payday 2 is a really fun experience, especially with friends. There is a lot to do and the game is full of content even though people like to argue that. The base game will give you way more than 20 hours of enjoyment if you like team-oriented FPS games. So, in my opinion, this game is worth the asking price but it goes on sale a lot which is even better.   In case you're still on the wall over buying this I'll give you a breakdown of my experience so far.   Pros:    Amazing gameplay. Very fun especially with friends you can chat with. Everything feels pretty solid and there are MANY approaches to each of the heists. It's a little complicated at first but it's easy to get used to. If you're looking for many hours of fun for your dollar, this is an excellent place to put it.    Lots of levels. There is a lot of variety in the base game and pro versions of most heists which keep me interested so far. You can always play the DLC heists with your friends if they have it which is a plus.    Pretty good customization. When I do get colors and masks I have a lot of fun customizing them and it's awesome. It's even possible to get weapon skins and such but they are a bit more rare.    Randomized parts of certain heists. Even though most heists are replayed a bunch, lots of stuff changes so you can still strive to beat a heist perfectly with a hint of randomly placed objects and people.    Balanced equipment. Most of the weapons and items in the game seem like they can hold you in most situations so you never really feel underpowered unless you bring the complete wrong equipment. The game gets easier as you learn what you are doing in each heist but I never really feel overwhelmed anymore. Later stage weapons and perks make you much better and makes the game more enjoyable.    Cons:   Expensive in game items. Not like micro transactions but many in game items cost too much in my opinion. Later on its pretty easy to acquire cash so I guess it's not such a big deal but you have to pay for pretty much everything. Coloring your mask, applying patterns, adding attachments, stuff like that. And it doesn't stay usually. As in, if I buy an attachment for my gun, I have to pay to attach it every time if I ever take it off. Kinda silly in my opinion. Same with mask colors and masks but if you take a mask out of your equip, you basically have to sell it unless it's a special mask.   Dumb A.I. sometimes. Your partners are crappy at doing their job if you're playing with less than 4 people and you can't really command them to do anything useful. Not a big deal since this seems to be a team game anyways.    Poor solo experience. I am mostly a solo player but this game isn't too fun solo for me. I now play with my friends only because solo is very hard. Not all the time but most of the time. Solo is usually only fun if you know exactly what you're doing and have it all planned out. It's also better to be stealthy when doing solo.    DLC. There's too much DLC obviously. I mean, some of them are cool and you can always just join someone else who has the heists but there's just a lot to look at when it comes to the extra paid stuff. I hate seeing that I can't unlock something because it's DLC so I'll probably eventually get it all but very slowly and only when it's on sale. There's only about 3 or 4 DLC you probably really want anyways and they go on sale for about $1 pretty often. Just pick up that stuff on sale. I mostly just do it for the customization unlocks anyways. For the most part though, I don't see myself spending much on extra stuff anyways because the main game is so fun.     All in all, this is really a great game. It had a downfall at one point but it seems to be making up for it in a great way. I really love this game so far and can't wait to play even more with my friends.   9/10",

Cause somebody will f**k up wich can lead to some funny rage moments unless you have hours and hours of gametime in this game and you practically know every single mission detail.There are two ways to do a mission - full destruction or in stealth mode. If you finish mission in stealth mode you get an XP boost(not entirely sure about money boost).   If you play with AI you're gonna only be frustrated. Speaking of AI...AI in this game is not the best you'll see. You get weird/funny/that doesn't seem humanly possible type of behaviour from the enemies and the only difference you'll see difficulty wise is just the increased number of enemies and 'special' type of enemies will spawn more often. Not to mention your teammate's AI...they're either the biggest idiots or the bravest MOFO's you'll ever see.  As far as customization goes, this game's goot plenty of it. You can modify your guns in almost every single way imagined (the only thing you can't customize is adding camo on the guns...wich kinda sucks if you ask me) There are also loads of mask to choose from. It also have an RPG system where you get points for leveling up. Higher levels allows you to carry OP weapons/items at higher levels. The only weird thing about it that you need to pay with ingame money for skills that you want to get. There's also a perk system which gives small boosts to your skills.  At the end I would like to point out that this game is not for those who wish to perfect games. Why? Since they're releasing DLC in span of 1-3 month from latest DLC/update you get new achievements every DLC you buy. And you guessed it...this game's got a tons of DLC's and most of them cost money.

            "review_text": "When people say 'crime in a videogame', the first game that pops up in someone's head is likely 'Grand Theft Auto'. But just behind GTA is PAYDAY 2, a cooperative first person shooter with packed with both flaws and hours of fun.  Story: There actually isn't much story to PAYDAY 2, but I'll cover some of the plot at least. The game takes place in Washington D.C., and players take on the role of one of multiple heisters, from the former Chicago mobster Dallas, to the crooked Interpol agent Dragan and even to cinematic hitman John Wick, who cameos in the game as a playable character. (Although, he isn't voiced by Keanu Reeves.)  Gameplay: Gameplay is somewhat similar to most first person shooters with notable differences. The game is less about killing everything in sight and more about working together to complete objectives, weither it's sticking up a jewellry store or looting the deposit boxes from various banks across the city. In these heists, you use various moddable weapons ranging from assault rifles to shotguns and droppables from ammo bags to sentry guns. The game also discourages killing civillians, as when you kill one of them, weither on purpose or by accident, a small amount is taken out of the final cut as a penalty. After completing a heist, each member is issued experience points, money and a PAYDAY, where you choose from 1 of 3 cards to obtain either more money or unlockable safes containing skins for your weapons. The game also adds in a healthy dose of RPG elements, Inbetween heists, you use skill points to upgrade your skill tress and give new abilities like increased weapon accuracy with certain weapons and increased charges on your droppables. You also don't need to go in guns blazing all the time. Some heists actually require you to do things quietly with silenced weapons and hiding the bodies.  Downsides: As mentioned before, PAYDAY 2 has both flaws and fun. For one thing, the AI on both your friends and enemies is extremely stupid, with enemies relying more on superior numbers as opposed to tactics. Another problem is the players. If the host disconnects, the heist automatically fails, no matter how far you got. Also, most of the good weapons and characters are locked behind somewhat overpriced DLC, so I reccommend buying the GOTY edition on sale to make decent progress.  Verdict: I'd reccommend PAYDAY 2 if you buy the GOTY edition when on sale and you play with friends, otherwise you'll need to team up with random players and hope they know what they're doing.",

Big Bank is an example since guards tend to notice one of the hacked computers or other jobs that involve a very large, very obvious vault. hopefully, these get fixed in time.   still.... when with human team mates, best game around for quick, dirty shooty FPS with loads of cash to steal.   verdict? 8/10",

It is also a careful analysis of the direction the development team have taken the game in the last year and change and what that means for the future of the game. This is not going to be short. If you don't feel like spending several minutes reading a whole lot of detail about the history of a video game, keep scrolling. Otherwise, buckle in. I'll try to be as succinct as possible and assume no prior knowledge of the history of the game.  I have played Payday 2 for nearly 700 hours. If I had reviewed this game a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to recommend it enough. It has been a ton of fun, especially with friends. The difficulty levels provide adequate degrees of challenge depending on the competency of the crew from ridiculously easy to ridiculously hard. The achievements provided an added layer of meta-challenge for those times when I got bored with normal play. Progression was satisfying - a veteran player was a huge asset to the team, while new players required extra help from the team to make it through. The game rewarded players for learning the nuances and finding the 'best' way to complete objectives. New content was added at fairly regular intervals. Some was free, some was paid. All of it was quality content that enhanced the game, and I happily bought all of it.  Something changed.  I'm not sure when the change began. Maybe it was right around the first anniversary of the game's launch (Crimefest 2014). A whole bunch of free content was added to commemorate 2 million players joining the official Steam group. This new content was fairly well received, but I think the way the community came together to support the game set a bad precedent with the developers.  Future content became less and less about enhancing the game and more about adding content for its own sake (or for the sake of revenue. Power creep with new DLC weapons and items made the game easier for people who bought the DLCs, making the progression faster and less meaningful. The prestige system was overhauled to provide more grinding for the sake of grinding. Meanwhile fewer and fewer new heists were added, with the developers focusing more and more on weapon packs and character packs instead of heists.  The there was the 'Hype Train' event. This was similar to Crimefest 2014, except that instead of just joining a group, players had to buy exclusive DLC packages to 'fund' the event and unlock rewards for the whole community.  Hype Train left a bad taste in my mouth for several reasons.  1: Some of the free content that was promised during Crimefest had not been released yet. It was kind of weird that the developers were having another community event so soon without following through on the things that were promised during the last event.  2: The event advertised that the new content that was unlocked would be 'free' for the whole community, but the purchase of paid DLC was required in order to unlock the content. The exclusive content was extremely overpriced, with the justification being that it was exclusive (it wouldn't be sold again after the event), and it was overpriced on purpose because buyers would be supporting the event. Kind of weird to make the most loyal fans of the game support free content for less loyal fans... Luckily I saw through the bullcrap and didn't buy it.  3: Some of the images used to tease the 'free' content were actually images for upcoming paid content, with the free content being different stuff released much, much later. It was essentially a bait and switch to get people hyped and buy DLC.  So hopefully you can see why the Hype Train event really set the community on edge. Fans felt like their support and goodwill was a commodity that could be cashed in by the developers.  Future DLCs were much less interesting. Things were added that were completely game-breaking (such as the RPG, which has ludicrous griefing potential and is also completely OP) or just straight upgrades from existing DLC packs or core content.   I began to play the game a lot less. I still enjoyed it but it was really discouraging to see how easy it had become with the overpowered new content. The game was much less satisfying.  We are now in the midst of Crimefest 2015. I haven't played the game since May, but I learned from the Crimefest website that a new feature has been added that is similar to the skins and inventory systems in CS:GO and TF2, respectively. This is a huge disappointment, even to someone who hasn't played the game in months. This game does not need microtransactions. TF2 is free to play, so it makes sense that it has microtransactions. CS:GO's microtransactions do not affect gameplay at all, and CS:GO has zero paid DLC - all the gameplay content is unlocked by buying the core game.  Payday 2 now has: The upfront cost of the game - $5-$20 depending on the sales The cost of any desired DLCs - Anywhere between $0 and $111 Microtransactions - who the fuq knows?  As if this weren't bad enough, the pre-existing content has been nerfed to make room for the new microtransaction-based content. That's right. The weapon skins you get from the slot-machine DLC affect the gameplay. They're not just cosmetic. As if that weren't bad enough, many of the weapon skins are for DLC weapons.  In essense, the developers are triple-dipping on this game. They charge for the core game, they charge extra for what is now the vast majority of the content (there's more DLC content than free content now), and the paid content is MUCH better than what comes with the core game. On top of that, they charge for random weapon skins that DO affect gameplay that might be for a DLC that you don't have. SO basically unless you're willing to buy all $131 of existing content AND all future content regardless of the price, there's no point in even participating in the slot-machine microtransactions because you might get something you have no use for.  At the time of writing this review, the game is already so bloated that I have zero desire to play it anymore. When I log in I get to look at what seems like dozens of items that are locked behind DLC paywalls. Not only that, but players who have purchased this content can join my games and make it so easy for us to win that I don't even feel like it was an accomplishment anymore. This game used to be fun. The developers took advantage of the positive reviews to ♥♥♥♥ the game so they could keep the revenue flowing. The game is not fun anymore. The developers cannot be trusted to follow through with the things they promise to do. Save yourself the headache and buy something less bloated.",

Not as bad as it was when it originally released, but stealth mode is not something you can really do until you've unlocked extremely necessary mods.  +Bots are mediocre at best.

            "review_text": "I really loved this game, but as it stands, I can't reccomend it due to a number of poor decisions made by the developers recently. If you're reading this, these decisions have yet to be corrected.  About 6 months ago, Overkill released a 'timed' DLC pack for $20, 'The Completely Overkill Pack', during the Spring Event. The pack had 4 masks in it, and it was inferred that this was due to the pack essensially being a donation for the developers, presumably to continue working on the game. And that they did, in the form on numerous $5-$7 DLC packs. 11 to be precise. For the most part, people were ok with this, myself included. Most of the time, the purchase was justified. 2-3 guns, some melee weapons and a few masks. Unfortunately, due to the sheer volume of DLC released, we've gotten to a point where a ridiculously large amount of weapons, heists and masks in the game are only availeble with the purchase of additional content, inclusing but not limited to:  The best melee weapons in the game (in terms of DPS) -#1 Katana (Yakuza character pack) -#2 Motherforker (Butcher's BBQ pack) -#3 Switchblade (Golden Grin Casino heist) -#4 Trench Knife (Gage Historical pack)  All the tertiary weapons aside from the useless playing cards -Grenades (Gage Weapon pack 1) -Molotovs (Overkill pack) -Dynamite (Western pack)  Modifications for the best guns in the game -The Butchers AK/CAR mod pack -Gage mod courier  All the sniper rifles  The majority of the shotguns  LMG's  I could go on, but it depresses me.   So now, following the Crimefest 2015 event where the community worked together to complete goals set by Overkill to unlock   FREE   content, we've apparently earned the right to pay them for skins. On guns. Via microtransactions. That boost weapon stats.  After stating in the past that they would never do that.  [gamespot.com] .  Twice  .  So for the moment, I'm done with this game and this company. I don't recommend this game.  ",

            "review_text": "***EDIT: Wow... looking back on this, I originally posted just one year ago this week about how I thought this was the best game ever. It was one of the first games I finally started reviewing. It's terrifying to see how much changed in that one year.***  Wow... I don't even know what to say about this game anymore. If someone told me three or so years ago that I would leave a negative review for Payday 2, I'd think they were crazy. There was one time when this game was all I could look forward to every day after high school. My friends and I would talk about it at least 3 times a week, plan new strategies and new ways to play, go home and try it all weekend, and start over again on Monday with new ideas. This game has to be one of the greatest games on Steam, but it's ruined. It's kind of like seeing an old friend willingly walk out of your life for good. Buckle up, this'll be a long one... for an old friend.    TL;DR: Listen to P!nk's 'Who Knew'   I've played Payday since a few months after the first one came out, and I really looked forward to the 2nd one. When it came out, I loved everything about it. Everything felt better. Just better. The dlc that was introduced in Payday the Heist (Wolfpack, included the technician branch) was already in this game. When the first few dlc packs came out, I was happy to buy them. They all felt like they added so much more to the game. Grenades, machine guns, transport heists (although some people hated them, I really enjoyed them), they were all amazing.   After a while, it was obvious that they were running out of ideas for dlc, but they still made new packs which I bought right away as well. Adding new characters was a stretch for me, and so were single day + single mission map packs, but what the heck. People started to call the game 'Pay2Win' and whatnot, like they normally do as soon as a game has more than 3 dlc packs. I ignored them. They were, afterall wrong... at that point.  Later Overkill started pumping out weirder and less immersive packs that I just couldn't convince myself to enjoy. The Alesso Hesit, Golden Grin, Wild West, Medieval, &amp; Ninja packs, to name a few, just felt wrong to me. I slowed down my pace and eventually stopped playing the game for weeks at a time. Yesterday, Overkill announced Microtransactions to the game. I'm not going to go into too much detail, since the community is already beyond angry, but that was just a slap to the face. After playing the game seemingly endlessly and standing by the developers for  years , they keep trying to suck our money. Recently the website  pd2stats.com  announced their death. Go to that website by the way, and read the reason. Overkill lost touch with its community due to their own greed, and they pushed their community to pieces.  I'll say this again, since it deserves to be said,  Payday 2 is the best game on Steam . I honestly do believe so. Overkill though... you guys ruined it. I wish we could all go back to when there were just 3-4 dlc packs and only 4 heisters. The game was so fun and innocent back in those days. Even if you try to go back, it's impossible to play with the original 4. You can try to play the old missions by yourself, using old guns, and relive those days. You can try. But the mandatory addition of the newer enemies &amp; heisters will only remind you that those days will never happen again. Sometimes change is good, but when Overkill twists and bends this game the way they did, you just want that change to go away... but it can't.  Payday 2, you were a great friend. Looking back, I can't believe this all happened. I miss my old friend, but this friend willingly left me for greed. I'll never forget all of the fun I've had with this game, and I'll never forget why I could no longer bring myself to play it again. I'm sure I'll play it again. I'll wrack up maybe a hundred more hours on this game. I know I will... but it'll never be the same. It'll still be fun when I play it with my friends, but it'll never again be as fun as it once was.  Farewell old friend.",

            "review_text": "I don't normally write reviews for games, however I feel compelled to review this game for anyone who is considering buying it and is looking for info before they do. If you want in-depth analysis of the gameplay/graphics/sound/etc, this is not the review for you. This is a BUYER BEWARE warning about the state this game has come to be in since most of the positive reviews were written. It is also a careful analysis of the direction the development team have taken the game in the last year and change and what that means for the future of the game. This is not going to be short. If you don't feel like spending several minutes reading a whole lot of detail about the history of a video game, keep scrolling. Otherwise, buckle in. I'll try to be as succinct as possible and assume no prior knowledge of the history of the game.  I have played Payday 2 for nearly 700 hours. If I had reviewed this game a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to recommend it enough. It has been a ton of fun, especially with friends. The difficulty levels provide adequate degrees of challenge depending on the competency of the crew from ridiculously easy to ridiculously hard. The achievements provided an added layer of meta-challenge for those times when I got bored with normal play. Progression was satisfying - a veteran player was a huge asset to the team, while new players required extra help from the team to make it through. The game rewarded players for learning the nuances and finding the 'best' way to complete objectives. New content was added at fairly regular intervals. Some was free, some was paid. All of it was quality content that enhanced the game, and I happily bought all of it.  Something changed.  I'm not sure when the change began. Maybe it was right around the first anniversary of the game's launch (Crimefest 2014). A whole bunch of free content was added to commemorate 2 million players joining the official Steam group. This new content was fairly well received, but I think the way the community came together to support the game set a bad precedent with the developers.  Future content became less and less about enhancing the game and more about adding content for its own sake (or for the sake of revenue. Power creep with new DLC weapons and items made the game easier for people who bought the DLCs, making the progression faster and less meaningful. The prestige system was overhauled to provide more grinding for the sake of grinding. Meanwhile fewer and fewer new heists were added, with the developers focusing more and more on weapon packs and character packs instead of heists.  The there was the 'Hype Train' event. This was similar to Crimefest 2014, except that instead of just joining a group, players had to buy exclusive DLC packages to 'fund' the event and unlock rewards for the whole community.  Hype Train left a bad taste in my mouth for several reasons.  1: Some of the free content that was promised during Crimefest had not been released yet. It was kind of weird that the developers were having another community event so soon without following through on the things that were promised during the last event.  2: The event advertised that the new content that was unlocked would be 'free' for the whole community, but the purchase of paid DLC was required in order to unlock the content. The exclusive content was extremely overpriced, with the justification being that it was exclusive (it wouldn't be sold again after the event), and it was overpriced on purpose because buyers would be supporting the event. Kind of weird to make the most loyal fans of the game support free content for less loyal fans... Luckily I saw through the bullcrap and didn't buy it.  3: Some of the images used to tease the 'free' content were actually images for upcoming paid content, with the free content being different stuff released much, much later. It was essentially a bait and switch to get people hyped and buy DLC.  So hopefully you can see why the Hype Train event really set the community on edge. Fans felt like their support and goodwill was a commodity that could be cashed in by the developers.  Future DLCs were much less interesting. Things were added that were completely game-breaking (such as the RPG, which has ludicrous griefing potential and is also completely OP) or just straight upgrades from existing DLC packs or core content.   I began to play the game a lot less. I still enjoyed it but it was really discouraging to see how easy it had become with the overpowered new content. The game was much less satisfying.  We are now in the midst of Crimefest 2015. I haven't played the game since May, but I learned from the Crimefest website that a new feature has been added that is similar to the skins and inventory systems in CS:GO and TF2, respectively. This is a huge disappointment, even to someone who hasn't played the game in months. This game does not need microtransactions. TF2 is free to play, so it makes sense that it has microtransactions. CS:GO's microtransactions do not affect gameplay at all, and CS:GO has zero paid DLC - all the gameplay content is unlocked by buying the core game.  Payday 2 now has: The upfront cost of the game - $5-$20 depending on the sales The cost of any desired DLCs - Anywhere between $0 and $111 Microtransactions - who the fuq knows?  As if this weren't bad enough, the pre-existing content has been nerfed to make room for the new microtransaction-based content. That's right. The weapon skins you get from the slot-machine DLC affect the gameplay. They're not just cosmetic. As if that weren't bad enough, many of the weapon skins are for DLC weapons.  In essense, the developers are triple-dipping on this game. They charge for the core game, they charge extra for what is now the vast majority of the content (there's more DLC content than free content now), and the paid content is MUCH better than what comes with the core game. On top of that, they charge for random weapon skins that DO affect gameplay that might be for a DLC that you don't have. SO basically unless you're willing to buy all $131 of existing content AND all future content regardless of the price, there's no point in even participating in the slot-machine microtransactions because you might get something you have no use for.  At the time of writing this review, the game is already so bloated that I have zero desire to play it anymore. When I log in I get to look at what seems like dozens of items that are locked behind DLC paywalls. Not only that, but players who have purchased this content can join my games and make it so easy for us to win that I don't even feel like it was an accomplishment anymore. This game used to be fun. The developers took advantage of the positive reviews to ♥♥♥♥ the game so they could keep the revenue flowing. The game is not fun anymore. The developers cannot be trusted to follow through with the things they promise to do. Save yourself the headache and buy something less bloated.",

            "review_text": "Payday 2 is a great game - ruined by the amount of DLCs, constant updates that add twice as many buyable features as free features and pointless additions. I mean seriously, did the addition of cloakers make ANYONE pleased? The different difficulties really show, both in loot and in gameplay, but doing the same heist over and over and over again starts to feel very repetitive and grindy. Just recently I was happy to hear that they added a character from Croatia, until I heard that you have to pay for a DLC containing him, just like with over half of the weapons in this game. Not to trash-talk all over the developers' work, it is a feat to continue making updates for a game for this long, despite most of them being just DLCs.  However, I must say that the first couple of times I played the game, my friends and I enjoyed it and loved it to no end. If you're gonna buy the game, I recomend doing so while it's at a discount and not buying the DLCs - you have more than enough free content for the time which you'll be playing this before it becomes repetitive.  EDIT: After playing this game again, I got reminded why I enjoyed it so much. The game does get repetitive at a point, but the amount of content released in each update, both free and buyable is more than enough to keep you getting back. I ended up buying the Dragan DLC and LOL-ing and ROTFL-ing at his quotes, and I don't regret it one bit. This game is great, but I do recommend playing it over Skype or TeamSpeak with at least one friend.",

It's got a variety of missions, nearly limitless mask and weapon customization, a great soundtrack and overall fun gameplay.  First thing that makes this game so great, the vast multitude of missions. This game has so many missions, you can practically do anything that is illegal, whether it be robbing a small jewellery store or providing nukes for a Russian maniac, this game has it all. To my surprise, the missions that have the same objective as others are not repetitive. I thought to myself: 'I'm stealing an artifact? Again?' but my thoughts quickly changed when I started the mission. The maps are very creative and keep the missions fresh and interesting.   Second of all, the mask and weapon customization. You can put nearly any modification on any gun, so you can make a very effective weapon or a really stupid, but fun to play, weapon. I once put a sniper scope on a Deagle and it was loads of fun to play with, even though it's really dumb to do. The mask customization doesn't fall short either. Having an epic mask is the definition of being a heister. You won't be notorious if you have that default mask that everybody doesn't like. You ca make really silly to downright intimidating masks.  Thirdly, the sweet, sweet soundtrack. You CANNOT get enough of it. I can safely say that this soundtrack is better than Hotline Miami's. In my opinion, every song is worth listening at least three times. Not only are they great to listen to, they provide mood in-game. While fighting off those damned Cloakers, the adrenaline-pumping music makes it even more intense. I strongly recommend buying the DLCs that have songs included in them.  Finally, the actual co-op gameplay. It's absolutely wonderful. Every heister has to work together to complete their task. When I'm heisting with four of my mates, we sound very strategic even though we're only robbing a diamond store. I feel like we could be the next Ocean's Eleven while we meticulously plan our heists.  Something that I should mention is the absurd amount of DLCs. Personally, I don't mind the DLCs because I know that by buying them, I'm supporting the developers. Only one person in your group of heisters needs to own that certain bit of DLC so all of you can play the mission. The DLCs are small things, such as a new skillset, weapons and masks. Not having the DLC weapons may make the game difficult, but they're not necessities. The devs have also said that after Update 100, they'll stop making new content as DLC.  Overall, Payday 2 is an absolutely wonderful game. I would give it a 10/10 if it weren't for the paywall, so it's currently at a 9/10. Get this game if you and your mates want to have a fun time doing illegal things. ",

I was okay with purchasing DLC, but I am not okay with doing this microtransaction BS so I can get some sort of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love child of Megatron and Hello Kitty Sextoy AK-47. So now not only do the weapons look like complete rubbish when 'skinned' Overkill had the audacity to place statistics on the damned things thereby making it important to have them. I fail to see how having weapons that make you look like an absolute pillock increases their performance. Overkill speak about community, but talk is cheap. Rather than stick by their guns and keep their promises about not having mictrotransactions they go ahead and do this hogwash. Did I slay a dragon to earn this stupid looking weapon? No... so how the hell is it rare then in a modern world where I could have anyone paint it to look stupid? I expect my guns to be workmanly; Dark, Metal, and Threatening.   What makes this even worse is that the devs 'rebalanced everything'; ARs are bullet hoses, Shotguns basically are now BB guns for the lack of power they have and for some reason the 4 high damage pistols are doing just as much damage if not more than 3 of the sniper rifles. Granted I was wanting some sort of rebalance to make Plan B viable since they had massive negative damage modifiers for Silencers, which is absolute rubbish since they dont slow muzzle velocity noticably anyhow... but making Assault Rifles and shotguns struggle to be accurate and/or do damage isn't the way.  To conclude I would not recommend this game to anyone until Overkill addresses their terrible business practices and the weapon statistics.",

This isn't to say that it's anything close to open-world - but the feeling of agency in how you and your friends play lets you ignore the fact that the missions themselves can be be fairly linear.  The real joy comes from how you invest in your particular character, in the form of the skill tree. As you progress, you're able to mix and match your skills from four different classes, investing entirely in one path or becoming something of a jack of all trades and master of none. Even the weapons have a depth to them, with a great deal of customization available to them, allowing you to tweak them to suit your particular approach.  That being said, I would love to see some more novelty in the missions or yet more options. Some missions are clearly easier when you approach them one particular way, and with no real difference in reward in many of them despite your approach, it's easy to fall into habits. I understand that complete freedom isn't a formula for fun - but the illusion of it can be.   What would bring the game to another level would be an option to plan the hiest - with a map of the area (if it makes sense to have a map, or if you can buy that intel if you're a Mastermind) and have each player be able to draw on it, or make notes, going over the plan before the actual hiest begins. I think that there's potential for magic if this game is expanded upon to make a true hiest game, but for now, the tension of stealth and the chaos of police assaults is satisfying as hell.",

Teamwork is key when playing on the highest difficulties and some of the heist completly relies on it. one person screw up and and everyone ends up in custody. Completing heist give you cash that you can spend on weapons and tree skill to specialise your playstyle. maxing out the four tree being imposible, choosing wisely is important. while respecing is an option, it cost more money to reset rather than trying to put your skill pts in the right skills as soon as you can. Weapons mod and most of the mask and their customization are randomly dropped after every succeded mission, which makes it kind of hard to unlock some of the better mods and mask as they are rare and require hundreds of missions to drop.   Heist can sometimes be done quietly which will result in a exp % increase depending of the difficulty. And there is of course the loud way of doing it which will result in the cops arriving and making you life a living hell. The loud part mostly feel like a horde mode in which you do objectives that mostly involve a lot of waiting and shooting, With the usual special enemies from times to times.   While this game being a lot of fun, it sure suffer from some issues from time to time. The Single Player option is mostly a play solo option, cause the ai is brain dead and will not help with any of the objective, turning them into meat shield that will sometimes revive you if needed. Even if the game is mostly around Co-op, an option to give orders to bot would sure come handy in situation where you are short on human players. Connecting to the games online can be a nightmare and will sometimes keep disconnecting multiples times even required me to reboot steam in order to get into a lobby. And even if in game you will sometime get randomly disconnected from server for no reasons, and since the game lacks a decent matchmaking lobby, it sometimes makes rejoining imposible unless if you are playing with your friends which is the most recommended thing if you can. Also the dlc whoring is getting a bit out of control with multiple weapons and heist packs coming at 5$ each. with very rarely free expansions with few content from time to time. At least none of them are required to play the game and you can even play with people owning any of the dlc. You can also join dlc heist if they are available, you just cant host them.   But overall this game is a lot of fun if you can get past the few problems mentioned above and for 30$ its worth it in my book.",

Absolutely great coop fun. Quite a bit of DLC to get if you want all the content but I was ok with that, happy to pay for extra content and I could pass on DLC I didn't feel was worth it to me. I loved this game so much I bought many copies for friends and family and also bought hundreds of dollars of DLC for myself and those friends and family. I had a great time playing this game with friends and family for years.   So why the thumbs down? Very simple. Microtransactions were added to the game. Now, I'm not saying microtransactions of and by themselves warrant a thumbs down. This is a terrible thing because of how, when and why. It's the quality of the company and the reprehensible actions they have taken to exploit their player base time and again with only increasing volatility that has incited me to reverse my position on the game.  To begin with, lets talk DLC. As mentioned there is a quite a bit of DLC for Payday 2. Initially I didn't mind this but as time went on the quality of the DLC steadily decreased. It became apparent sometime in the last few months that DLC was being churned out without any decent regard for quality. Characters that don't fit at all and have veritably no story, content packs that are basically an advertisement for a DJ...that you pay for! DLC has increasingly been more and more worthless over time.   But that's just the beginning of the slide. DLC going down the tubes is one thing. DLC wasn't enough, now we have microtransactions! Several studio officiates are on record having stated a number of times that microtransactions would absoutely never be added to the game. I do not appreciate the system of how I pay for content changing drastically after I have invested into a franchise for years. More over, I DESPISE BEING LIED TO!  Being lied to is bad. Being lied to about microtransactions AFTER shelling out probably around a grand and investing hundreds of hours in a franchise....well, that's being robbed by an old friend (that you helped put through college). This degree of dishonesty is a complete slap and spit in the face. Wether you paid for just the original game and never bought DLC, or if you're like me and bought enought copies and content to equal a used car, it's completely unacceptable for a game studio to lie to and attempt to exploit the player base in this way.   I encourage anyone looking at getting this game to stay away. Payday was a great game but you missed the boat, all that remains now is rampant profit mongering from morally bankrupt suits.",

This game has 2 perspectives, 1) Those who keep playing as they like levelling up, and challenging themselves with new difficulties etc. and 2) Those who get sick of grinding, as the start of this game is really, really, slow... Most players (As far as I'm aware) come back to the game after every new heist update, and these happen multiple times per year, so if you're the kind of person who likes a game that is updated frequently for new stuff, then you'll be happy with the outcome.  If you can bypass all the DLC... But this game and all of it's DLC is on sale just about every month anyway, so you can pick up some extra stuff dirt cheap.  - Personally recommend you buy the Gage Mod Courier DLC, very useful :)",

The customisation options are expansive and remind me of Modern Warfare 2; skill trees for specific group roles based on stealth, support and brute force are a bit like a 'perk' system and you can paint your masks and guns to your heart's content. The multiplayer aspects I like are that your actions only effect your own cash and XP score (i.e. if you kill a civilian or get gunned down) and that you must finish the entire length of the mission in order to receive your rewards - this means that if random idiots ditch the game at crucial points they get squat. Bear in mind that a lot of these customisation options are DLC locked, and so far I haven't seen the benefit of having bought lots of the DLC packs. If it comes out on sale in a whole package + all DLC again buy it then but otherwise the game itself will provide you with many hours of adrenaline-pumping criminal capers.

At one point in time we were 'shamed' to think this game would ever incorporate microtransactions, now we are seeing them in what can only be described as 'CS:GO' style, by giving you safes like drops in CS:GO, where you have to pay almost 3 dollars of real money for a 'drill' which is essentially a key, to open the safe. This alone wouldn't be terrible as it just gives you a cosmetic skin, except that isn't really the case.  These above mentioned skins give you stat boosts along with being skins, which essentially turns a great game that was already borderline ridiculous with DLC that was accepted, into a game with lots of DLC now being greedy with microtransactions. It's sad to see a great game soiled with greedy producers, especially with a game that went far and beyond expectations with copies sold as well as DLC sold, so it is simple greed that has tarnished a great reputation with one swing.   If you don't mind pay 2 win in a game with tons of DLC already attached to it, then go for it. Yes this is a fun game, but in my opinion there is no place in a full priced game with lots of DLC to also include pay2win microtransactions.

Tried to load into Safehouse raid of my friend..BOOM Crash and more stuff i'm crashing to.. 3. The ''We need more money dream''..what i'm talkin' about? The amount of DLC's this game has! ofc, i'm not talkin' about DLC like Weapon packs or else, i'm talking about DLC (for example) Biker pack...Yeah, why should we add just one DLC with Character, Map, and weapons? WE WILL SPLIT IT INTO 2 DLC'S TO EARN MORE MONEY. or the Spec Ops pack...Literaly, why would someone buy it for literaly nothing? i'll better wait for some dlc giveaway to get it than waste money for DLC's like this...  That might be all for the bad part...  The ''GOOD'' part of this game.  1. It actualy gives you some challange!.. What i'm talkin' about? about finishing Heist or higher and higher difficulties. ofc, with no expirienced team is ONE DOWN little bit...To much when ur trying to play it on Public lobby. 2. Who doesn't like stealing money, or the white sugar and other things? or killing like 1k cops in one single heist? with the mutators it's even bigger fun. 3. the thing u don't need drill for safes now and that fact, the SAFE can drop from cards at the end of the Heist, good motivation to play it, atlest for someone :P 4. Customazing masks..actualy, it would be boring wtihout customize your mask :P somemask are just hell-funny when u customize them xD 5. Some updates actualy makes the game better? Yes, they do. i would better apriciate better optimalization...But i believe OVERKILL will fix it someday...

The game by itself is a good game, but these shady antics have officially made a good game turn bad by a shady company going back on previous comments.  At one point in time we were 'shamed' to think this game would ever incorporate microtransactions, now we are seeing them in what can only be described as 'CS:GO' style, by giving you safes like drops in CS:GO, where you have to pay almost 3 dollars of real money for a 'drill' which is essentially a key, to open the safe. This alone wouldn't be terrible as it just gives you a cosmetic skin, except that isn't really the case.  These above mentioned skins give you stat boosts along with being skins, which essentially turns a great game that was already borderline ridiculous with DLC that was accepted, into a game with lots of DLC now being greedy with microtransactions. It's sad to see a great game soiled with greedy producers, especially with a game that went far and beyond expectations with copies sold as well as DLC sold, so it is simple greed that has tarnished a great reputation with one swing.   If you don't mind pay 2 win in a game with tons of DLC already attached to it, then go for it. Yes this is a fun game, but in my opinion there is no place in a full priced game with lots of DLC to also include pay2win microtransactions.   Look elsewhere and save yourself the frustration now.",

But you can change your skills whenever you want, sure it cost some money, but this is another point why i love this game. As many others say there is always a adrenalin push. You can shoot every guard down and be expected to kill mayne police/FBI men, or you can do it 'stealth'/silent so that noone is calling the police. Whatevery you do, there are ALWAYS things, which can go wrong, so every single game is different and gives the player itself new experiences. i hope this review was helpful for you.

A fantastic class system leveling tree allows for a large degree of customisation in how you want to play, especially when heisting with friends.

            "review_text": "Definitely more mature than games like Call of Duty... Military vs military is one thing, but bringing cops and robbers alive like this really twists with the mind and your sense of ethics, hoping for the bad guys (you) to win.  Being a mature, violent game doesn't make it bad though! In fact, those are what make it so good. On top of an RPG system to level your character and spec into four tactics trees (leader/medic, tank, damage, and stealth), the game offers the options to play stealthily, by suppression and control, or guns blazing and everyone around you dying. There are levels of difficulty in the police that responds, with it increasing over time (or difficulty of the heist), if you show you're a big enough threat for the police to call in snipers and the SWAT teams, riot shields, the FBI and helicopters, and your new best friend Sam Fisher (not to mention some nasty bruisers in bomb suits with portable machine guns or shotguns that make you wish you stayed home with mommy).  As far as story goes, there isn't much of a rigid storyline, although there are a few major clients that contract you to their heists, with some lasting a couple days, and their motives become pretty clear - the characters are less of common bank robbers and more of mercenary vigilantes, working for others to steal money owed, and pocketing some cash for themselves along the way. Getting that extra cash usually isn't easy either, at least not nearly as easy as it is to get the main money or other precious items intended for the contractor.  Still, good communication and teamwork make the heists very possible. That's something the game is good at, too. Clearly built around multiplayer, even giving you two (very crappy) AI companions so you can play alone, the game works wonderfully with four players. Meeting most of the classes' roles between the four, there are a lot more options for how to perform the heist, and give players a specific job to focus on. Someone may be watching out for guards or dispatching them and moving bodies, while another is working on shutting down security, while another is drilling into a vault, while the last is controlling the crowds and tying up civilians to use as hostages. Mastermind class is good with people-skills, like being more intimidating and convincing people to assist (including under-trained guards, etc), as well as healing allies. Enforcer has tougher armor and can resist enemy fire more, as well as being more efficient in combat in general, and can drop an ammo stash. Technician can use sentries and trip mines, and is great with using drills and modifying weapons. Ghost gains bonuses to silenced weapons and armor piercing, an electrical device to disable cameras and other electronic security, faster and more efficient lockpicking, and the ability to bag (and move) bodies. When they all play together, the game runs with so much more fluidity, and can adjust to whatever they come across.  And what they come across does matter, as the levels all have random details in them. Doorways in walls, counters, placement of jewels, safes, guards, the civilians walking along the street (or a hotdog vendor that attracts cops), random money or gems laying around, camera placement (if at all - sometimes there aren't any), or where your getaway vehicle shows up. Locks may require a drill to get through, or a keycard, or can be picked open, or even blown up with C4; spending 5 minutes managing a drill as you try to get in a safe and think you're done and can run out of there can be stopped by a door inside the safe that needs another drill, explosives, or can be picked. Wasting time with another drill may get you killed, just as using up your explosives on another secure door may leave you with little option to get through this next door, but with multiple players, you still have choices and can handle the random that shows up.  If you can't tell by this rant, I do really like the game. It brings together my favorite elements of Hitman, Left 4 Dead, and Borderlands, in a way that makes me want to keep playing, ESPECIALLY with other people. Some thanks to others who have it and sharing what's great about it with me, without which I wouldn't be playing it now at all... and that's a sad world.",

When I first played it it felt like such an upgrade from the first one which I had a lot of fun with this one even more fun. The downside is the replay value and DLC. Now don't get me wrong this game is epic and has a ♥♥♥♥-ton of customization for masks and guns and is really the only bank-robbing game out there. However it does have downsides. Fist off the community. Very rarely do you end up with an enjotable party. Usually it's someone who: is level 5 and goes on a deathwish mission. A hacker which NO HACKER HAS BEEN BANNED THERE ARE TONS. or it's a tryhard who kicks you for the slightest mistake. Sometimes you get a nice party and have fun but that's what makes this game so fun playing the heists with a good party for the first time. Secodn time around on a hesit you have more planning and what not and understand it better. But after that it's just repetitive. I know the devs pump out a lot of free missions which is awesome but it gets old but not too old I mean I got about 70 hours on this game but there are other games for 30 dollars which can give you much better replay value. But that doesn't matter it's the experience right? Anyway going back to the DLC....WHY..ARE...THERE....SO...MANY...♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ED DLC? Although the devs give out free stuff (if you join there steam group) there is a ♥♥♥♥♥-ton of DLC that should be packaged together for a lower price or just included in the game. Like these character packs. I was fine with clover I guess they wanted to target a female demographic or just have a female hesister. But then it got boring. Dragan didn't need to be a character. A croatian cop? Who thought of this? Second many of the DLCS are overpriced. For exampel the big bank hesit is about 7 bucks. And that's for a hesit a couple of weapons a few masks and some mask customization features. Why wasn't Clover packaged with this? Another money-grubbbing DLC released was the Completely Overkill Pack. Now don't get me wrong I love overkill I played since the original payday but they need to fix 2 major issues 1. the amount of DLC and 2. the ♥♥♥♥ing hackers that are everywhere. But I digress. This game is really fun but don't expect it lastign you 1,00 hours heck most games can't even do that. I highly reccomend it despite a few community and DLC related issues. 8/10",

One glitch however is the glitch that you get stuck in a vault door and cannot escape, which need fixing. Overall the developers (Overkill and Starbreeze) made a exellent game and even though it is a bit rough around the edges it is mostly ok (bug wise).   The thing I dislike about the game is that you need a good graphic card. For some people it might not be a propleme but for those that have a weak pc or a laptop you might have to turn down all your video and resolution settings for smooth gameplay. Not saying that if you don't you'll get laggy gameplay, I'm just implying that if you lower your setting you will get smoother gameplay. However, this isn't a probleme with the game just with my pc.  There are in game purchasses that riddle the game. Now you are not obliged to get them but they are something that you might want. The DLC (downloadable content) are things like more weapons, more Heists, masks, attachments and things like that. There is no paywall and you can play as much as you want without making a second purchase.  The gamplay itself consists of you, and 3 other members of the PAYDAY gang commiting crimes that range from robbing a bank, to robbing a museum, to transferring coke (not the beverage), and other things like that.The heist all (almost all) are different in style and have different diffuculty. Note that the list above does not contain all the heist because they'er alot and they are to many to mention.   I hope you found this reveiw helpful and understandable.

The game suffers from glitches and bugs that I saw back when I first started playing Payday 2. They've never been fixed. Optimization is still garbage after massive overhaul of my rig.  The game has been receiving DLC's. A lot of them. Too many of them. Most are just pricey character packs. Characters that we really didn't need. New heists are rare and most of the time, they are mediocre or just bad.  And with second Crimefest arrived the pay to unlock crates with weapon skins. These weapon skins aren't purely cosmetic. They are NOT PURELY cosmetic. They have stat improvements. Think CS:GO crates but the skins have benefits that affect the gameplay.  I'm not sure why the mindless community supports this money-grabbing but I wash my hands from this mess. I loved this game. I even wanted my own Wolf mask. Today I say goodbye to this franchise.

The game evolved so much and at the same time it feels so familiar that you gonna love it right from the first minute of play, especially if you played Payday: The Heist previously. If you ever thought of playing FPS Co-op - this should be your first option to be considered.  Taking away those bugs and issues, a bit less than expected heists quantity (the game is still at least twice as big as first installment) and other issues, the game is marvelous. The game got several times bigger the original, it now has stealthy way of completing nearly every mission along with run'n'gun style. It has tons of customization options (I wonder why people were talking about high prices for mods / paint jobs etc - after several overkills walkthroughs you always have more than enough money for everyting). The game might feel repetitive at times but it still has good replay value and you can easily spend another full weekend with friends in it (as well as your previous one). I am not the one so concerned about graphics and I am patient enough to not shout out about first bug I encounter - developers will seize them eventually.  Payday 2 is ultimate co-op experience and I do mean it. It's great cinematic scenes when you are trying to escape running through the street full of cops with bags behind your back. The good thing is that you are the one acting. It feels like you are actually robbing the place - not just shoot everyone in Payday 1 style. And with updates coming (and coming and coming) the game gets tweaked constantly. Developers of Payday 2 are among the best devs right now in a sense that they really doing their job of making the product insanely good and I was glad to hear that Payday 2 has received Best Co-Op Game of the Year award - it doesdeserve it. All in all, I do recommend to buy this game - whether it's on sale or not - they game will return you every cent spent at least twice. And be sure to co-op with 3 of your friends for a much better experience. And another great news - devs started to deliver us DLCs (promised us 5) and if you will enjoy base game you will have additional content to enjoy in a while.  Overall, 9/10.

I paid $50 for this game after loving the first Payday, and playing the beta I thought this had so much potential, that Payday 2 could really be something great, but it isn't. Payday 2 is pure frustration and trolling in digital form.  I don't say this because the game is hard, I am fine with hard games, but because Payday 2 is designed to troll you. This game features stealth heavily in many of its missions, yet also features randomly pathing AI, and restricts the number of bodies you can move to 2 ontop of allowing you to only kill 4 guards before automatically raising the alarm. The most recent heist added also enforces stealth, and if the alarm raises it gives you 50 seconds to make your escape, and if you do not have an arbitrary amount of loot acquired you will recieve no rewards, even if you did manage to obtain some loot before escaping.  With so many random elements to this game, even when you DO manage to complete a heist perfectly, the victory feels shallow. There is no feeling of 'I did this, I rock!' only the feeling of 'Well, I got lucky'. Because you know that you only won because the game didn't have a randomly pathing guard go down the alley way where you were forced to leave a body. Or because you know you only won because the vault spawned in a location where no civilians would hear the drill. You won because you managed to get lucky this time, not because you were good at the game.  If you like a game that will do everything in its power to screw you over, by randomly pathing AI finding the body you aren't allowed to move, or four cops with shields in a corner, or a cloaker hiding right next to the escape van that instantly kills you one nano second before victory, then this is a game for you.

The game has its pros and cons as it expands, players in the game are pretty solid and nice but thats not to say everyone is in this game at times. If you played the original (Payday: The Heist) then I'd recommend this game for old school fans and if you're new to this game then check it out as well as the OG other wise there would be somethings you'd miss out on such as love for the iconic and non generic character list this franchise has.

The worst thing Korean MMO's ever invented is now in my Robbing a bank game... worse unlike CSGO where at least the skins are 100% comesmetic the Payday 2 skins are stat boosting. Want a sweet skin on your gun? Well first get a safe drop or buy one from the marketplace then buy a drill for 2.50$ EACH and each safe of course contains one skin.  It's horrible, terrible, very bad idea and the biggest kick in the balls?

CONS: - Semi-broken. Very buggy with lots of lazy errors. - Stealth is very poor. Enemies seemingly have the hearing and eyesight of an omniscient being, regardless, it is made pointless by poor design choices. - Becomes EXTREMELY tedious, boring, dry and repetitive after you complete all the heists once, or even before then. (5-10 hrs). - ABSURD amounts of DLC. While it started as simple aesthetics and silly skins, it eventually grew to the point of excluding people who are not willing to drop nearly 200$ on all the expansion packs. - No real creative difficulty. Rather than limiting you in certain ways, the only way they seem to make the game any harder is by throwing more and bigger enemies your way. When it boils down to it, the toughest enemy and the easiest are only separated by their health.   While this game was very, very fun for a brief period of time, that's about all I can say about it. It's okay looking, but doesn't run particularly well, with resolution issues (Can anyone say 'letterbox'?) at anything higher than 480p. While that can easily be fixed by editing some .ini files, that's not something a player should be left to do. The missions are fun and inventive for a litte bit, but always boil down to a fetch quest gone wrong, in which you have to hold out in whichever location for X amount of time until you have a brief window to transport contraband, rinse and repeat for the umpteenth time. Any 'stealth' one might attempt is futile, because once you endure the painful process of dodging every enemy and civilian within a 10 mile radius, it all goes to ♥♥♥♥ once you star attempting to open a door. As much as it breaks my heart, I simply cannot recommend anyone to buy this game at a price higher than next to free.",

Don't have the DLC for the gun that popped out your micro-transaction safe? Doesn't matter; you can't use the gun until you buy the DLC. This type of practice goes directly against what was promised to us by the game's main producer back in 2013.

[...] It doesn't matter if you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth, or a crack rock in your mouth.' Juggalos have compared themselves to a family.  Common characteristics of identifying a member of the Juggalo subculture are as follows:   Drinking and spraying the inexpensive soft drink Faygo.  Listening to horrorcore and other types of underground rap music.  Wearing face paint, generally those either like a clown or perhaps similar to corpse paint.  Wearing HatchetGear.  Having the Hatchet man logo applied on personal effects and die cast worn such as in a necklace or on a t-shirt.  Doing hair in the spider legs style, i.e. like the Twiztid members  Displaying the gesture of wicked clown, the westside sign with the left hand and the C sign in ASL with the right, with arms crossed over.  Making and responding to 'whoop, whoop' calls.  Expressing a (generally) tongue-in-cheek obsession with murder, committed with a blade weapon.  Juggalos view the lyrics of Psychopathic Records artists, which are often violent in nature, as a catharsis for aggression.  Many characteristics of the Juggalo culture originated from in the 1980s, when Joseph Bruce (Violent J) and his family were living in poverty. He and his brother Robert received all their clothes from rummage sales, and their food from canned food drives held at their own school. Due to their poverty, the Bruce Brothers were the brunt of many jokes in school. However, the brothers were not ashamed of their living standards, and instead embraced it. Joe even made a name for themselves, Floobs. According to Joe, a Floob was essentially a scrub, but not just an ordinary scrub. A Floob 'wore the same old shoes and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clothes from rummage sales [...] but [...] didn't even have to be cool. [Floobs] turned [their] scrubbiness into something [they] could be proud of.' Though Joe only specifically names himself and his brother as Floobs, he alludes to other Floobs whom he had not met or known of, but were living in the same conditions as he and his brother; the respect that Floobs had for each other and their family-like embrace of likewise people influenced the philosophy held among Juggalos.",

The gunplay feels much better this time around, with guns that respond appropriately whether or not you fired them inside or outside a building, this coupled with the better animations and shell casings that bounce off walls create a more in-depth experience when you customize your weapons with the various weapon mods available. Mowing down cops has never felt so satisfying. Not that you always have to mow down cops though, as many missions offer different approaches, usually meaning you could pull off the heist quietly without sounding an alarm or loudly and just walk into the bank guns blazing. Regardless, it's a fun experience with up to a total of four people playing cooperatively. Where Payday 2 falls though is in its lack of variety in the heists-though there have been several heists added since launch. One small problem I have with the game that probably doesn't correspond to everyone is the difficulty of hte game-lack of difficulty that is. In the first game heists were incredibly difficult, which would be seen in the displayed success rates of heists, sometimes even hitting a one digit number in some heists on higher difficulties. The game feels more like a mainstream shooter now, but nonetheless it's a fun experience with a few friends.",

The guns have a great feel, and so does the intensity of the, 'Get it done! Let's get out of here!' action. The game is a blast. On the downside: guards are far too sensitive to tasks performed on the other side of a concrete block wall, the number of cops is a fantasy, the power of dozer cops is even more fantasy -- sometimes PD2 doesn't even try for play-balance, the power of the fire arms is way off in both directions -- and are the product of play balancers rather than reality, and the idea that you have to draw cards in the end mini-game forever just to get a gun sight you can spend $120k on (?!?!?!) is poor design. The game is also mercenary on selling you small things like extra slots for weapons or equipment ($800k?!?!?!?) If they just allowed characters to trade rewards, the game would balance so much better. Still, few games feel so rewarding (maybe Killing Floor) when you have a well-honed team, although the game is over-biased toward ghosts. I will keep playing it.

            "review_text": "I’ll be honest, I don’t know where it went wrong.  When I first bought PAYDAY2 just over 2 years ago, it was fantastic. It was just released and it had a lot going for it, I still remember my first heist down to each bullet fired – it made a really good memory I still think back to. There was a great selection of frequent and upcoming features and the developers really had their heads screwed on right, I finally found a substitute for killing floor 1. Everything was great.  Then my graphics card broke which forced me to take a year’s break. I got a new graphics card a year later, reinstalled PAYDAY2 and…well. I didn’t recognize it at all. It went from an award winning game to a development company saying “maybe later” and constantly lying to its community, even insulting them in community posts as “noise on the other side of the rails”, starting in-fights in the community itself.  Any criticism it took was either ignored or suppressed, which just made people angrier at them and their “yeah whatever” ethos. They even said 'driving will never be in the game'. Then they went and added a driving mechanic a few months later.  Better yet, a year ago they announced a completely different game they would be doing. And then pinned it on the Steam PAYDAY2 forums. It’s clear they are using PAYDAY2 as a launching pad for their next game because they sunk PD2 so badly a while ago.  The game itself had devolved greatly as well. The engine had seemed to have gotten worse at holding solid frame rates and the maps given to us only had a tiny bit of random chance such as 1 wall being in a different place or two optional places an item can spawn.  The issues of desync also still plagued the game, making it impossible to play on stealth missions because guards could see you through walls. Something that could be cured with dedicated servers, but the developers just met the community with a wall of silence or changed the subject each time.  The AI is basically slightly less smart than a sack of bricks. They will enter the area, stand around idle for several seconds and then run to cover (which doesn’t cover them at all).  At which point two things happen. A) They will stare at a wall and go idle, doing nothing B) They will track you through a wall and maybe move to run at you blindly  I have caught the AI several times (as I turned a corner) starting at the ceiling doing nothing, only to engage me a whole 8 seconds later by snap-locking to me and shooting me point blank. This happens very frequently  Balance doesn’t exist in PD2 either, there are a handful of weapons that are actually useful and the rest you surpass far too quickly and just serve to bulk out the inventory screens. Out of my hundreds of hours, I have only used a total of 6 weapons - because the rest had no incentive to be used and were never given any adjustment.  All the skills are driven towards a handful of weapon types (mainly shotguns and pistols), so SMGs and “special” weapons such as grenade launchers get no love at all. I have had many times where a fully modded and upgraded shotgun can just 1v1 literally anything on the hardest difficulty. Which makes gameplay very linear.  Additional content is the main thing that killed this game. The price of the content isn’t an issue, but the quality and perks they give you are completely out of line. Much content was either horribly broken on release or didn’t work at all. Many issues such as characters having no voice lines could be noticed and fixed within seconds of testing. But it’s clear they just don’t test anything they make anymore.   Like they don’t even care.  Much of the paid content gives you a massive advantage and game changing ability to survive the harder difficulty scenarios. And all the free content gives is boring cosmetics and items that make little or no impact in the game whatsoever. It’s clear they make the free content just to hope people shut up about it.  All the content and features from the past year are unimaginative and very much the same Weapon packs Character packs Skills  Nothing really new or inventive at all. Which is why I recently lost interest, I played for hours to find a reason to keep playing.  But after the petty insults, poor PR and terrible updates, I have just had enough.  Now Payday2 boasts microtransactions, which is another thing the developers said would never be in the game and lied about.  If you are ever doing a research project on how poor PR and development can destroy a product, this is a goldmine.",

I was thinking about joining them. I checked what DLCs are out now because my friends bought the GOTY. And im shocked DLCs worth of 100€+ (not bundled). Even if i would buy the GOTY now and get the DLCs, i would have spend over 100€+ for this game (I bought some DLCs after release). Which is just stupid for a game with a maximum 100 hours worth of playing.  TL;DR If you dont dont own the game yet, get the GOTY you get the content theat should have been there for the release and maybe 100+ hours of fun. But I for my part feel a bit scammed by the amount of DLCs and the lack of content in the initial Release.",

I still dont have too much experience but so far its a great game with too many DLCs (microtansactions) that barley add anything worth to the game other than a few new weapons. If you think about buying DLCs only do so if they are on sale and you want new guns to play with.  So far I can recomment the followings DLCs.  -Sydney Characker pack: Adds an amazing, fun to play with assault rifle with a 100rnd magazine. Worth buying!  -Gage Shotgun pack: Adds 3 shotguns of wich I personally only like the pump action. Also adds a few new ammo types for the shotguns. HE or Slug rounds can be usefull to take down shields with a few hits but overall i still mostly use Buckshot. Worth it if you like the idea of more shotguns and ammo to chose from.",

You follow 4 people in PAYDAY 2 called Dallas (The thinker), Chains (The muscle), Wolf (The technician) and Hoxton (The ghost). As the player we get to select which character we wish to play as but it doesnt stop there. You can pick the skills you want your character to learn, The mask he wears, The guns he uses and the way he enters. Payday 2 Is brilliant with its coustomization of masks and guns making your character 1 of a kind and the guns can effect the results of the robery, Hold off or escape. The game missions will always change by either changung the postions of the vaults to adding more guards to adding more cameras and other possiblities. It would be near impossible to explain all of the changes this game can do with just a click of the restart mission button. To be honest at first i thought this may be like Payday:The heist so i was kind of put off but i watched some videos and read about it and now playing it it feels like the creators have listend to the fans and have improved the game. From missions to your safe house everything feels like it never gets old. Lastly, one feature that caught my eye is the card choice. If any of you reading this have played with me you will know that i love this bit. It allows you to get items which cant be obtained through normal assestes e.g kill 100 SWAT, Rob 50 banks ect. You get given 3 cards and you have to choose one and the results vary. From new gun attachments to new masks this method never gets old. And the best bit is it usually happens when you complete a heist so you get money and other things yay. Oh and money is more usefull, You can now buy alot of equipment now so insted of just getting it for looking purposes you can spend it on paint for your masks or weapon mods. From characters to gameplay the game never lacks to impress me. Only problem i had was a bit of lag but if you do have that there is an option to turn the graphics down so it runs nicer and smoother. If your thinking of getting PAYDAY 2 go ahead it is brilliant and you wont regret it! Thanks for reading! ",

Communication can be key, especially in stealth missions. There are quite a few guns, four skill trees, and 100 levels. The level of customization you can have in your character is great, and this is the same when it comes to guns. Your four skills trees are as follows; a tank type tree, a rogue type tree, a healer type tree(also acts like some sort of controller), and a generalist(?) type tree. Graphically it's nothing to write home about, but it's not bad either. The sound is cool, and if you've ever watched Heat (1995), the gun sounds may remind you of that. The music is cool if you play with it, but can get annoying after a while (I've since turned it off). In the later levels it gets to a standard RPG style grindfest, and god it can move slow. Perhaps they will add some huge heist that that really level you up high in the later levels, but at this point some of the ranks can take 3+ of the most XP giving heist. I would recommend playing it with a dedicated group of friends, don't count on random, teammates to always have the best coordination/communiation skills.",

Robbing a bank/throwing bags/cooking meth/throwing bags/dealing with it/throwing bags/sneak into museums to steal arts/throwing bags/break into politicians house to deposit cocaine/throwing bags/steal gold/throwing bags - with friends - much fun! Fair to say the game was quiety fun playing it with 3 friends. The gameplay itself was pretty cool in the first place. But as said, it got nerfed. In the end you can either choose to be the coward rambo or the nimble mouse. When you don't kill swarms over swarms of cops that stupidly straight just follow their way while yelling the few sentences they can yell you will be the one doing an elementary task or keeping watch. (Most random onlineplayers can't do the last part. Multiplayer was a maximum rustle when taken too serious on harder difficulties). Continueing by throwing bags from A to B.  - You can just start a heist and straight go the fail way: dont cook meth (aquire ingredients, put in the wrong ingredient at the wrong time, get out of there because the place is about to blow up. Otherwise you can't escape the scenery), straight get back to the van to escape. Thus leading to the deal with the cartel will blow. Shoot' em all up and just get the one elementary bag. Rush through the next stages. Don't get easy extra money because it's not worth it. In total you get more experience points for doing that than solving it properly or even try to do an okay-job. Also saves you a lot of time time. With experience points you can satisfy your lust on the skill tree. First you should spend your points on handling bags. That's for sure.  - Doing your best in a heist. Try to get as much loot (bags) as you can (eventually sneak and let pass dangerous situations/actions). In comparence to the above it takes much much more time and effort to do. In the end it was worth the money most the time. Most of the time you deposit ALL bags at one place and when you have to move you take them, you throw them, one by one, then you go to your new pile of bags, take them and then you throw them. Under heavy fire or not. This is the basic gameplay.  BUT HERE'S THE POINT When the heist is finished succesfully each player gets to choose to reveal one of three cards. You can get get masks, patterns for masks, colors for masks, also you can rare patters and rare colors for masks (My all time favorite was the pink 'Gag Ball'-mask with PAYDAY 2 written on the forehead). Besides you can get weapons and weapon accessories.  Attaching/detaching accessories on your gun is disproportionately expensive.  ONLY when you have the certain card of something you can actually buy it.   Congratulations, you broke the law big time just to end up like Heisenberg - containers full with black money you cant even spend. 'Say my name.' '...' 'Say... my... name!' 'Heistenberg.'  To cut it short: I had a good time playing the game and gained lots of money. Could not spend it on something usefull because I had some missing cards. So I practically repeatedly finished heists as fast as possible in a succesful way to get the said cards so I can eventually can get rid of some millions of my quadrillions. Not throwing so much bags. :( Got most of it unlocked and bought and it doesn't change the fact that there are no more than 9 heists aviable.  Newest published DLC-ulcers (useless kiddy stuff nobody asked for or even needs - for only 5 €!) lead me to the conclusion that the game should be renamed to: PAY 2  Uninstalled the game quiete a time ago.

When the hypetrain event started I thought it was the bottom of the pit, but nope. Microtransactions followed. Attention was shifted away from actual content to pleasing kids who wanted better looking waterguns to sprinkle their balls with AND had the money to waste on them. Finally Overkill acquired the rights to the game, they made the biker heist, which was actually good I felt hope for the game for the first time in a long while. Then skills got revamped. Then difficulties got revamped because the skills were too op. Then weapon stats got revamped because the difficulty was too op... The game started out as a thoughtful heist sim, even the GO bank heist was reasonable for a christmas themed mission (later event maps became terribly silly) then the DLCs and the updates became more and more of a farce until the whole game became a parody of itself and it's fans who put a lot love and more importantly, MONEY into it. If I could, I would get that money back, because this is NOT the game I've bought in 2014. I have to say, if I'd look at it now, I definitely wouldn't buy it. And I don't recommend it to anyone.",

            "review_text": "Update!  Overkill have decided that any brainless gibbon should be able to win on every difficulty without trying, so the game has slid futher down the easy path and thus become even less fun and boring. So really the only people who should buy this now is anyone who likes games which never present any kind of challenge, or those under the age of 7. Also, in updated news Overkill remain one of the laziest, underhanded developers on steam, and basically all the people with any talent have left the company.  ...  Really the game is on a solid downward spiral. Over and over again the developer has shown they care very little for the core game experience or silly things such as balance. If you are looking for some kind of decent challenge, it's kind of unlikely you'll be finding it here. Really if you like challenging games stay away. The developer seems intent on turning this into an 'everyone can win' kind of game instead of it being challenging or fun.  The developer loves to buff stuff, and has been buffing things for a long time now. DLC packs will come out with better and better weaponry (most recent example is the mini deagle, which has basically no downsides at all), perk decks (grinder) and other things designed so that everyone can play on the hardest difficulty with minimum effort. The weapons were also buffed to rediculous levels (some doing over 3x the damage they used to do) with almost no downsides. They tried to do the laziest possible rerebalance, but that made very little difference and showed how little the developer cares about the core game. An obvious example is the poor Broomstick pistol.   The developer gave this poor pistol the lowest damage for a pistol in the game, along with the slowest reload and slow fire rate meaning it was rendered entirely pointless. If they'd given it any effort at all this would have perhaps raised some kind of question. But yet they've done the same thing twice. It's hard to belive they do any gameplay testing or even play their own game at this point. But they clearly don't ever or care much beyond making money.  You can see this evident form the numerous bugs and dull gameplay that all the new heists seem to share. It's all grind 9001 bags for big Xp and fast levels to pour into the entirely pointless new Infamy system where you level up to erm, level up more faster. Which is yet another example of how much the developer cares for the base game, the last 8 Infamies don't even give you a reward of any kind. At almost every stage they have been getting lazier and lazier.  All the new content seems to just be Drills and Skins for $2.49 a drill. These aren't even pretty items you'd remotely want unless you had very poor taste. I'd estimate they take around 3 minutes to do by a blind one armed gibbon who had the mouse in it's mouth while being attacked by bees. The developers doesn't seem to care about it's playerbase and loves to inflict this crap designed to prey upon weaker willed members of society (it's basically gambling without the rewards) which is yet another amoral step they've taken.  The playerbase has taken a huge nosedive in response to the developers lies and scams, and it's very hard to find a decent team to play with. Really there's little reason to buy this game anymore.   The game used to be fun, enjoyable with friends and have a decent amount of depth to it, i've had many fun experiences playing this game and met a bunch of great people through it. Yet time and time again the developers lie and cheat the community adding in money making schemes for absolutely no reason (the most recent being stat boosting microtransactions). So really at this point I cannot recommend this to anyone and feed Overkill another player they have less than zero respect for.  The spiral continues. All that comes out now are paid for ads and rehashes of old heists. Oh and more overpowered weapons, because in a game with vertually no challenge left, that's exactly what was needed.",

            "review_text": "Worthy sequel for one of my favorite games. It's bit different, but has more content than first one. I have enjoyed both games, and still do enjoy this. Going back to first game seems to be hard, as it feels different.  This game is co-op game, so have some friends to play it with, or try to find someone to play it with you; there are loads of trolls in-game, and they keep kicking randoms out, so host your own games, or play with friends.  Maps/Levels whatever you want to call them, are smaller than in first game, but there are loads of them unlike in Payday: The heist, which i still played over 200 hours. This is balanced with so called 'multi-day' jobs/missions. You proceed days on mission, and get your money on last day. There are contracts that are one days, two days or three days.   Also, if you don't stealth, (which is possible in many maps),there are escape missions between days, where your objective is to survive for like 3-5 minutes so that new escape vehicle can arrive to pick you up. These tend to annoy me sometimes, as there are about 7 of them, but i always get either Overpass, or garage escape.  Also, sequel introduces you bags. Loot bags. You have to actually carry stuff you steal, and it's big part of the game. Maybe little bit too much, but there are missions which aren't just about carrying bags from the bank to your van.  As in first game, soundtrack is superior. Awesome work by Simon Viklund, again. It fits game perfectly, and they have added many songs prior to release. They have also had 25 updates so far, fixing and adding stuff. If there a update people don't like, overkill has done something about it. If you want the game, get it on PC, as console patching is slow...  One of best co-op which you can have, if you allow 'some' grinding and it being bag throwing simulator.  Btw; you can move hostages these days ;)  ",

When playing solo with bots they dont do anything but shoot or get in the way, the online multiplayer is seriously flawed whereby a host can kick you from their game after you have done everything in the mission to ensure success. They need to change that it so that when the objective is breached hosts can not grief the other players by kicking them intentionally right at the end so that the person who did all the work dosnt get anything from the heist.  removing modifications off weapons does not give you any money back and does not keep the mod in stock, its almost like when you detach the mod the guy throws it in the bin which is not what you'd ever expect and is not realistic at all. expecially when modifications cost an arm and a leg to craft. cant really thing of anything positive to add other than it was fun for the first bunch of hours before I realised that the host can grief you by kicking you which completely turned me off this game.  an utter time waste with a gaming community that 90% of players have bad attitudes.

Yes, I can't recommend that enough. Friends that you know are reliable, and are willing to listen, will make great teammates in this.  Now, all you really need to do to enjoy the game is buy the base game itself. The DLC heists can be played if the host owns it. However, if you want to get more weapons, masks and patterns, as well as achievements, you will need to purchase the DLC. Are the DLCs worth it for the heists? Yes. Weapons, masks and patterns? Not really in my eyes. Most of the DLCs only have one weapon worth taking. Probably the best DLC would be the Sniper Pack, but then again that's my own opinion.  The game is still being actively worked on, and we're getting a lot of free stuff through CrimeFest.  The game offers a lot of gameplay and I still am enjoying this game.

On the console version we barely get any guns not alot of masks and not to many heists. Us console versions need more guns,mask,and heists so basiclly what i am tring to say is that they dont really care about console the updates are very rare. Its unfair. On PC well you guys get all the goodies more mask guns heists everything. The game is good but start caring more about the xbox 360 and ps3 version just a little more. ;(",

            "review_text": "Pros:   Damn fun game with solid stealth and gunplay with unique settings and scenarios. Highly replayable missions and an interesting lottery drop system Amazingly fun to play with friends - especially while drinking heavily  Cons:   Very buggy NPCs - even this long after release dont be suprised to see lots of pathing issues including oddities such as random strolls through solid objects and ruined Stealth missions when a body part clips through a wall/floor  The NPCs make higher difficulties a major burden. The Special Police forces are barely a challenge; The real danger is the horde of regular SWAT units who shoot fully automatic weapons with pinpoint accuracy - sometimes from locations that make them impossible to see or hit in return (See the clipping issues above). This turns many 'Action' levels into a frusterating game of ressurection spam since cover is only marginally helpful  While the game is fun with friends, random parties often lack the co-ordination to complete some of the more complex missions efficiently. While this is true of many online games it really shows in Payday where teamwork and situational awareness are mandatory. Sticking to easier missions online is also a non option as well since the game heavily penalizes you for completing the same mission too often  Payday is very much Pay to win. While the vanilla game has an 'ok' selection, many of the best missions, weapons, upgrades, and coveted achievements are hidden in the 5-7 dollar content packs (Grenades being one of the most noticeable). Payday has turned the expanded content game into a full time gig with new pay walls being raised every 2-3 months with an initial investment that by this point costs more than the base game itself  tl:dr  Payday 2 is an amazing game to play if you have a fairly regular group of friends to heist with as good online groups are uncommon and offline play is inefficient at best and nearly impossible otherwise. I would also only ever recommend buying the game during one of the steam sales when you can catch up on the content packs without paying AAA prices for the combined package",

            "review_text": "Decided I'll give this game a long and somewhat detailed review, mostly for friends who are on the fence on purchasing.  I have enjoyed this game for over a month now and continue to enjoy it. TL;DR? I recommend buying this if you liked playing difficult coop campaigns with friends on Left 4 Dead.  At first it's a game about discovering how to simply complete various heists and trying to earn skill points and money to be better at completing the maps. You'll have a sense of accomplishment from just finishing levels and may have your hand held by more experienced friends or players. Skill trees and money will seem daunting, but you'll look forward to the skills at the end and see figuring out missions as a way to get closer to those goals.  After you get used to the game you'll find it's rather easy to earn needed money, skills will become less important as your own player skills will become more important. You'll feel less challenged on some maps (bank heist :V), but others on more appropriate difficulties for your in game level will make for a lot of tense combat moments for you and 3 other friends. Especially when trying to pass maps on the highest difficulty, Deathwish. Essentially Deathwish will see even maxed out players having to make quick and very critical decisions with your 3 teammates in order to pass. Or... you'll find cheesy ways to win, but those are boring and will exist in any game like this.  The game includes a 'prestige' system where you can start over leveling for some bonuses, but it's by no means necessary to do.   The developers are constantly supporting this game and releasing new content. Some DLC, some free! DLC can get pricey as a total, but feel free to be picky about what weapon packs you buy (don't buy the shotgun pack if you aren't using shotguns :V), and keep in mind that if a friend hosts a session and has a DLC mission, they can include you even without you owning it. You just can't host and pick the mission yourself or play it yourself.  Some downsides: The game has glitches. Some are quite annoying too. I've experienced being stuck on loading screens, not being able to connect to friends who I was just playing with for seemingly no reason, and guards attacking (even worse in stealth, detecting me!) in really glitchy ways. Maps have also loaded with weird errors around which had effected the ability for friends and I to complete maps. Funniest example? Drilled open a safe, there was a safe inside. I was not happy. Also when you stealth missions, the actual execution of the heist can be fast, but on some missions there's a lot of standing around waiting for drills to finish drilling locks/safes open for extended periods of time. These are points where you've essentially already won the map, so there's nothing left to do and you just run in circles letting time pass. That can be kind of boring. Have a book nearby or Alt+Tab out, you'll be fine... sadly that's not good game play.  Conclusion: Excellent 4 Player Coop Experience that continues to reward and challenge you as you learn how to play, but may seem very daunting at first. Tons of content and continued dev support ensures the game will continue to be something you're coming back to. Just be prepared for some glitchiness and to have some game play time that is essentially waiting around. Also be prepared to spend more than the base price on DLC.",

However, the A.I. is actually great for backing you up in a shootout. My recommendation, start off with low level missions to build your level up and make some money. You'll need better guns and skills to do the harder missions, especially with another party. Multiplayer is where it's at, and for somebody who mostly likes playing open world games by himself, that is saying something.   In the opening three hours, I trashed a mall, robbed an armored car, robbed a jewelry store, and got got trying to sneak some paintings out of an art museum and had to improvise.

We tried a second time, but some other guy walked infront of a camera, setting of the alarm, which was more understandable.

I feel comfortable because we have taken out half of the bank, and tied down most of everyone. I decide to walk into the other half of the bank thinking we already covered that area only to find a bunch of people screaming and police yelling and the alarm going off.

Also payday will stop playing sound and it won't come back on untill you restart payday 2 by coming back on and playing it again. There are a few more bugs that I will tell you and these bugs I have faced; sounds not stopping and just keep playing forever. The game says it's running but it's not. This last one is about a glitch a lobby and I found when we were doing the four stores mission, the safes opened in an instant with the drill so we went on a bank heist, well... yeah, it glitched out there too and opened the vault in an instant too!  But over all the bank heists and the missions story line and guns, you can't forget the guns! Oh, the wonderful guns!  You can buy a gun and then you can put things on it to make it better! You also have an armour and XP level, you also can buy skill perks and make your own masks and trust me, you can make some pretty cool masks!  You can go online if you're feeling lonely or if you just want to get away from the AI and play with real people! I love how the high levels (like me) help low levels! (some of them)  The amount of DLC's and Missions are CRAZY! I might try some DLC's out in the future but right now I'm writing a review for the game PAYDAY 2!  It's tottaly worth paying for!  Sooooo many people play it!   So you say you don't like going loud/you're bad at it? Well... You can go stealth in some Missions! You don't need to go just loud! You can go quiet and not go loud! And there is a gift for you if you go stealth and complete the mission! I will leave that a secret and let you find out!  If you think going through that same mission is fun, well you better try other ones. You may say 'Why can't I just keep doing this one?' Well because you start to lose XP gain from Missions and soon start to lose your current XP level!  If you keep going through the same mission and failing and you can't get a lobby online without getting kicked out by the high levels... Well have you tried to buy the Assets? They can make the mission 75% more easy or they can make it 100% more easy and you can finally finish your Mission!  PAYDAY 2 is a game that you want if you can't get GTA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ect! Because you're doing crimes but not as bad!  I give this game a 10/10 rating! It is great!",

Take in the Low-Res textures, kiiling thousands of fake SWAT, stealing fake digital money to spend on over-expensive fake weaponary and fake masks, while OVERKILL heists your real wallets with endless DLC, including cut content, given back to you in forced updates for all, hidden behind real paywalls. FUN FOR EVERYONE  This game has gradually been destroyed, as the developer looks to further the means by which it sucks in cash through pointless DLC. If looking to purchase this game, save yourself some trouble. DON'T. If only wanting to pay for the base game. You will be severly underwhelmed by the options that come as standard, and will be severly disadvantaged in higher difficulties, as you do not own the weapons or various explosives needed.  Robbing banks with friends is fun, but DO NOT purchase if looking to play with randoms or solo. You WILL be disappointed with the lack of smart partner A.I. and difficulty spike, and the constant kicking by nagging 12 year olds. However it can be a very good game with 3 friends, and the money to pay for every single DLC as it comes out, as they are crucial to achieve success.  It is a shame that this developer (OVERKILL Studios) abandoned its roots with PAYDAY: The Heist, which only came with 1 DLC, and turned to simply churning out pointless DLC, to simply turn a profit. This removed any possible potential for this franchise of being a community driven game, with a supportive and caring developer behind it.  My Advice: If you can afford it all, then great, buy everything for 3 other friends and play the hell out of it. If not...  BUY GTA V and play the Online heists (Better in every way). IT IS CHEAPER TOO  4/10",

The mechanics of the game is amazing. everything is like a masterpiece. I saw alot of reviews complaining about the repetitive gameplay or the mechanics in the game like throwing bags. what you are looking at here is a ((GAME)) not a movie or a documentary. There should be something unrealistic. And talking about the repetitive gameplay all i can say is that you didn't play the game enough to say that or you are just doing the same thing over and over again. Try to be creative, I mean isn't that what gaming is all about. If you did it in stealth then do it as an assualt or even challenge yourself (possiblities are endless). all i can say is that the game is truly worth it. i mean really considering a the price, most people spend more than that on stuff they dont even need. in short list this is what i can say:    Wonderful graphics   Amazing mechanic   The concept of creativity exist   Mind blowing music   A lot of unlockables and challenges   challenging gameplay   fun to play either solo, with friends or just with random people   A lot of DLCs that add content to the game   hot-fixed and patched regularly   Talent system with perks    i could go on and on about this game and i still wont give it justice. word of a regular gamer 'try it!!!' and you wont regret it.

            "review_text": "Probably the best team PvE FPS game ever made.  It has little quirks and lack of features other games have (like picking guns up off the ground when out of ammo), but this enhances the game experience and makes it even more unique. There are many mods too, like the official mod HOXHUD, which fill the gaps in extra player needs for making the game more user friendly. The bot pathing can be bad, especially with civilian hostages, but this too kinda of makes for more realism as I doubt hostages are ever easy to control all the time. The maps Hotline Miami map in basement and Big Oil engine clues require high graphics settings to read, which is annoying, but someone usually has specs or knows the answers by heart from so many replays of levels, so not a big deal most of the time.  The worst part of the game is actually the community, which is some what surprising as the best people of the community are absolutely fantastic, the bad ones being the extreme other end of the spectrum. I smashed out at least 160 hours in 2 weeks once to get to V-100 (the current xp cap, which will be raised to XIV-100 in time), this rapid gain of levels which in the end took me over 315 hours to achieve earnt many kicking from games as people accused me of hacking my much fought for leveling (you can go 2 hours without gaining any xp due to noobs, trolls, and incompetent players). There is sadly a large hacking element which pull the game down some, and make for inexperienced players who may have a high level but are clueless as to what needs to be done to finish a level; which also has an extreme other end of the scale of people who play solo or just with one mate, and have played less difficult maps more often and leveled slower, but can win games constantly at their low level with a good team. There are difficulty skull masks for Hard, Very Hard, Overkill, and Deathwish, the Overkill and Deathwish masks used to be seen rarely, but now they are quite common due to both hackers cheating for them and there being an ever growing number of good players.  Being a lover of Tenchu, who would love to see them all relaunched on Steam (hint hint Steam, do eet!), the stealth game is something I really enjoy, this is way up there in that category and the leveling system gives many good skills to enhance stealth and how to approach stealth in Payday 2. They have patched the balance many times and stealth was getting pushed out, but the Clover DLC adds the Burglar Perk Deck which gives back much of what was lost, but some say not enough, the challenge and risk makes for more adrenaline so I am happy with it for now. There are so many gun mods I have at least 2 of every gun, typically 3 or 4 of the guns I like in different configurations for different missions and skill sets. As such the Cage Courier Pack is the first DLC anyone should get as it greatly expands options and works well with the all the weapons including the Community items, join the Payday 2 Steam Community as soon as you get this game then relaunch it to update it!. This is my first review so I am bit all over the place, but this game is so worth it, especially if you can get the GOTY edition for $40 or less. On a bad day of playing (or a bad couple of days) due to the bad people in the community, with the level you'll rage at the bullcrap, this game is almost a thumbs down. When the game first came out all the players seemed to hav a pro attitude which I miss, since then I have now built up a a good group of people I play this with so can always find some good action for scoring paydays, if you have a group of gamer mates you can get in to this with, you should all get in to it now!",

You might find a few guys who hate everyone and everything here and there, but those kind of guys will be found in every game. Weapon and mask customization is a factor in gameplay, and the DLCs had a few more hours of gameplay to the game. Great replay value, 9.7/10.   EDIT: Since I made this review, the game has been flooded with tons of DLC content, most of which is unnecesary, but some of which is pretty much required to get a full expereince out of the game. I dislike that Overkill Software is jumping on the bandwagon of using DLCs that you need as a moneymaking gimmick, but it still is a great fun game. Updated Rating: 7/10",

It's understandable, and I was livid back then too. But a lot changed in the last months and I believe It's time to change my opinion.  NOW, months passed after an update I can't remember the name (sorry) but Overkill did a video of apologies and explanation that I think every PD2 player should see.  In a resume, Overkill didn't had the rights of PD2 and the microtransactions was the fastest and 'best' way to get money so they could buy the rights again. Explained by Almir himself.  The infamous Black Market wasn't removed, BUT buying the drills (keys) was removed in the steam market, now you must get them by playing and have a lot of luck in the payday card drop. Now this is much more pleasing in my personal opinion, makes you play even more if you are a 'skin hunter', I'm not but makes the winning 10x more enjoyable.  Now we are having the anual celebration, this time called 'Hoxton's Housewarming Party'. I admit I miss the community objectives like in the other events but different stuff is most of times fun. FREE STUFF! WHO doesn't like It? A new safe house. ABOUT TIME! And It touches my heart as a veteran to finally see a better place for the crew, and actually see them around the place and interact with them. This must be the best update ever and 'party week' in the PD2 history.  Overkill, you did great in buying the rights back. Maybe you should have told us before release the black market update, but the rights were from Starbreeze, so if you were censored It's understandable. Because Almir only told us about this AFTER Overkill take It back.",

Ok, so with 35 hours I probably cant really be trusted to leave a good review. But here goes.  When I first started playing payday 2 I enjoyed it so much. There were so many missions to do. There were so many guns to buy and work your way up to. I thought I would never get bored of it. After I hit my 30th hour or so, I realised something. I wasn't having any fun at all. All I was doing was the same missions that I had done a million times before in the exact ways I had done them a million times before. It was literally the same thing over and over and over and for what. I get it that the goal of the game is to get to infamy level 25 or whatever but if anyone (and im probably offending a ton of people here) can even be arsed to grind mission after mission to get to even just infamy 2 they are pretty stupid. There are a ton of other games you could be playing that aren't the same thing over and over and over. I would compare this game to walking to asda killing a bunch of people, nicking a kit kat or two and running out and then doing it again, and again, and again. If that gets boring we can just go and rob the sainsburys.  Ok so maybe I exaggerated a little bit. Wait a minute. No I didn't, this is literally all you do throughout the whole game.  Ive dragged on perhaps too long but what the ♥♥♥♥ are the dlcs for this game. They are overpriced as all hell. ♥♥♥♥ing £4 for ONE extra mission and like a few masks, ♥♥♥♥ing well good deals.",

            "review_text": "One of the best co-op experiences. Ever. Its mechanics while brutal are for the most part refined and it's a blast to play with friends. Couple problems:  1) Graphically, this game's pretty mediocre. Lot of low res textures and what not.  2) If you don't have friends to play with, the game isn't really fun.  3) There's latency issues. Nothing major, but weird and a bit annoying.  4) The company's name perfectly encapsulates their approach to DLC. There are over 30 pieces and counting. The game isn't free to play and they're working on a sequel. Sort of BS right? And the DLC is sort of required to really enjoy this game. It's good on its own but the DLC is what makes it a lot better. Your arsenal is a lot more varied, you get more perk decks, new characters with fun voicing, etc. And the heists. You probably are going to really want these. Golden Grin, Goat Sim, Point Break, and Wolf Pack heists are all pretty good. My recommendation, have one member of your group buy all the heists and have him as the designated contract host. Still shouldn't be this way. Should've clumped DLC together and only released a couple packs a year.  This game is really fun and is held back by some poor decisions and poor support on Overkill's part. They have supported it, but it's costly support and it'll rack up quite the tab. Wait until a sale to get any DLC and if you're not sure if you want Payday 2, there's events where the game goes free to play temporarily. The game is tons of fun with friends and has a beautiful combination of action and strategy. One of the best games I own.",

I suppose the developers have done it this way to keep people in the game, but the grind takes the enjoyment out of the game, you either grind a mission for cash, or another one for XP, or another for cards (unlocks come with cards). Your not actually playing and enjoying the game.  With the smaller selection of maps to play on, all with roughly the same style/gameplay you get bored quick, and once you can solo the hardest mission on the hardest difficulty you cave in, the game is boring, empty and a useless grind.",

This especial enemies can easily take down the players if they do not coop to outsmart them. But dont get me wrong this isn´t a mindless shooting game, cause in some missions where stealth is an option you may choose that sneaky way, wich is usually hard but most rewarding.  The game also features an inventory and skill based system, thanks to the first one you will be able to buy weapons with the money earned on previous heists, and also attach mods to them like increased magazines, silencers, flashlights, and many others. The skill system offers 4 different skill trees (Master mind, enforcer, tech, and ghost), and the player can invest the points he earns with each level on one of these 4, creating a unique character depending on the player playstyle.  Some free heists and weapons have already been added to the game, making the paid dlcs (mainly weapons) entirely optional.",

Even though I bought it for cheap if I knew that I'd like the game this much I'd gladly pay full price for it if I didn't already have it. Loud heists are really fun and stealth, for me, is the much more fun (albeit painful and much more difficult) way to do things. It's a great game with a lot of good replayability. One of the things I can say that's a problem about it, which reall isn't a problem with the game itself, is that coming into the game late. All of the DLC can be a litle overwhelming, I recommend buying the DLC on sale. However this isn't THAT bad because you don't need the DLC to play it. Only the host of your lobby needs it to play it. So if a friend has the heist you want to play, you can join.   TL;DR Very good and replayable game. You can take heists loud of stealth. DLC can be a tad overwhelming if you don't have any.",

What I want to talk about is Overkill's attitude towards the community, and their complete inability to keep promises.  Let's talk about a site called  pd2stats.com . pd2stats was a website made by a fan of the game, with no official support, that provided a wealth of information about the players. It was such a useful tool that HoxHud, one of the most widely-used (and I would argue essential) mods, provided direct links to pd2stats from within the game.  As of today, pd2stats is dead. Why? Because Overkill fell through on their promises. All that's left on pd2stats right now is a letter to the community. You can read the whole letter for yourself, but some key points:   'A few weeks ago, Overkill has promised Last Bullet [A payday modding site] to work together on making a new, much better, mod format for Payday 2. We discussed this once, then arranged another meeting. A day before this meeting, Overkill has cancelled it, indefinitely. Nothing happened on this matter since. A year ago we were promised that one of Last Bullet would be a moderator if at any point they would ever do a workshop. We were not informed of the recent workshop addition, nor were we offered a position in this recent workshop addition of any kind.'  'Another week passed, no replies, seemingly no one cares. And it turned out that Overkill does respond to other people about various matters. So this implies that they are on purpose ignoring this.'  Overkill repeats the same pattern over and over. Promise, ignore, go back on promise. Hell, we're still waiting on safehouse customization, and they promised that before the game even launched.  Anyway, the TL;DR is this: Payday 2 was tons of fun, and had a great community. Sadly, the developers' attitude towards the community and their inability to follow through or keep their promises means that there's no longer any trust, and I can't honestly promote a game that could be turned into a cash grab at any moment.  It only took two days to turn an amazingly fun game into a cash grab more blatant than Candy Crush.",

There's something I have in mind to make the game more fun, I think that not only let the BOTs heisters wear their own mask but also hold their signature weapon (or even melee weapon) would make it more interesting to play in single player mode (sorry I have no friends). Although I'm no programmer, it still doesn't seem like a hard thing to implement. If this feature could be added to the game, I would really appreciate it. :)  P.S. It's good to make a game more challenging, yet I think making the dozers able to sprint feels very weird. In the past, whenever I see a dozer, it's a great threat, I'd avoid the area as much as possible to stay away from danger, only fight when they slowly walks towards me. But now... It's like a cloaker with more health, the fear of their appearance is totally gone because they don't have that heavy feeling anymore... I don't know how others think, it's just my opinion.  Still, PAYDAY 2 is a great game and I'll keep on playing it.",

The missions, while somewhat repetitive, keep themselves at least a little bit fresh by switching up where the objectives for certain parts of the mission so no two heists ever go down exactly the same.  However, there are a couple glaringly obvious problems with the game, such as the safehouse not actually being upgradable yet, despite Bain's reassurement that you'll be able to fix it up 'soon.' When is this? Half-Life 3 soon? Blizzard soon? Who knows. Also, the AI teammates are pretty much useless for anything except a bullet sponge or (a big)maybe occasionally a revival. They can't set a drill, fix said drill, carry a bag, or be told to do anything except 'HEALZ PLS!' or 'FOLLOW ME!' And finally, the enemy AI only wins with extremely overwhelming force, and glitches into/onto walls and apparently can shoot through said walls half the time. Lastly, some of the things that are DLC-exclusive really don't seem like they are worth paying even $1 for.  This all being said, this is a decent game if you have 2 or 3 friends to play it with that can actually co-operate and not just YOLO into every mission, and it's on sale when you buy it. I wish there was a sideways 'kinda' thumb for recommendations, because this game is deserving of it.",

If you like guns, co-op shooters, robbing banks with friends and killing the entire police population of Washington DC tenfold, this is the game for you. I've been playing this game since a little bit after release and I still keep coming back to it near daily.  A very good time (and money) sink with lots of base content, though many of the 'Meta' gear is locked behind DLC though OVERKILL has been working with the community to address these issue by adding free community content, grabbing everything on sale (50-75% off) is the best way to go about it though you don't need ALL the DLC, any missions can be played as long as your host owns it.  Most of the gripe comes from people not willing to pay money for DLC, though I own every piece of it, it's still possible to play on the highest difficulties with a vanilla game build. Micro transactions were also added which alienated a large portion of the community but I feel that OVERKILL has addressed this as well by changing up the system to remove the micro transactions part (other than the steam marketplace trading).  The amount of crossovers (John Wick, Point Break) and celebrity cameos seems to be drawing flak but I do like the addition of characters they are bringing to the game to mix things up, the Point Break DLC still is one of my favorites.  Overall I have to say Payday 2 is a great game and definitely worth the price tag, but if you would like to extend the amount of content and time you will be putting into this game, make sure to grab some DLC while it's on sale!",

The sound is especially good, guns sound very loud if fired indoors and less so when firing outdoors as well as having a punchier more realistic sound than the peashooters in the first game. The skill progression system makes the game more interesting instead of it being a routine grind to the maximum level possible. Find yourself a good team of friends and get this game if you liked Payday: The Heist but wanted much more depth to your heisting.",

You don't just blaze your way around to rob a store or bank, drilling the vault and escape. You need more strategy and planning in PAYDAY 2, which also make stealth approach as an option, and sometimes a primary option for most. Doing stealth is not easy, but you get a bonus for doing stealth. Teamwork are more encouraged in PAYDAY 2, especially on stealth approach.  Weapons in PAYDAY 2 are also more customizable, barrel, scope or sight, stock, magazine, laser sight and more. You can customize your weapons to suit your skill tree and perks, or just customize them to be something you prefer. Mask can also now be customized with patterns or colors to make yourself unique among other criminals.  Graphics of PAYDAY 2 is far better than the previous, more detailed and more beautiful. With masks and weapons customization system and detailed models, they look so beautiful, making the gameplay so epic and making your customization even more unique. PAYDAY 2 performances are also good, despite sometimes I tend to crash.    But there was one thing that was lacking: DLC DAY 2",

Payday 2. The Bank Robbing Game That Robs You.  Before I can even properly review this game, I have to talk about it's DLCs, that which you probably heard that it has an astonishly (too) high amount of them. I'd like to say that this game (That you have to buy to play) is not pay to win, but that would be too easy.   If you want to have fun and experience a more convenient gameplay, you WILL HAVE to buy some DLCs, and I have to remind you that each usually cost about a 5th to a 4th of the game (4.99$ to 7.99$) Weapons such as most sniper rifles and ballistic weapons like grenade/rocket launcher (yes, this is still a ''Bank robbing'' game) or basically making the shotgun-weapons type usefull by unlocking a selection of various ammunition types (Looking at you, HE Rounds and Flechettes). Same with some Perk Decks that have totally unbalanced the way of this game, like Burglar for Stealth, Grinder for Run-n-Gunners, or even get a freaking game that not everyone may like just for one character pack (I'm sorry Jacket, you're just no that that appealing to me.)  -Luckily- Overkill let most of the DLCs with a decent price during sales of any kinds, making them sometimes less than 2$, so if you are going to buy this game and the DLC's, do the smart move, and buy them during a sale. Our wallets have already bled enough, we do not need to drown in the financial blood of the new arrivals of heisters.  For the game now.  Payday 2: Drill Fixing Simulator - Steam Edition This game takes an interesting spin at RPG-FPS games by allowing you to modify how you play with skills of different varieties, such as carrying an ammo bag or medic bag like in the first game, but also specializing yourself in different types of weapons. For more ''Technical'' skills, you can get the ability to carry C4 charges to open doors and safes faster than a drill would (Otherwise, use a faster drill) . If you like the stealthy approach; you can lockpick faster and use more ''quiet'' ways to open doors faster, like an ECM jammer for electronic security doors or master lockpicking if you want to open a safe (otherwise, use a drill.) or doors faster.  Tailor your own gameplay. Play in a team of four (Preferrably with friends.)  Now grab your guns, and realise that your guns are utterly awful. That's right, when you start, you have the lowest of the low in term of firearms. You look at your friend who introduced you to the game, killing cops without even taking a second to aim, while you need three headshots to take down one guy. Well, do not worry. As you level up, you unlock the right to buy and use new firearms, and as you play, you can unlock modifications for these to make them even more efficient.  Payday 2: Crook Simulator  That's right. Everyone in this game is a crook. Either in a good way as they will do everything they can for the job to go according to plan, or as they will be the most devilish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and pull a Joker on you, and by that I mean... kicked at the end of the job.   Overall? an okay game. I like it, ignoring all th elatest controversies.",

            "review_text": "Payday 2 is a Co-op shooter where you try and stealthily rob a bank, but end up running round fighting off waves of Police with itsy bitsy silenced pistols in a kevlar waistcoat.  Except what makes this game great is that once you succeed a mission, you can use the money you robbed to buy new weapons, modifications, masks and skills. It uses the perfectly fitting mechanics of slightly open ended heist missions and RPG elements like skill trees and levels to create an experience like no other.   The graphical fidelity is quite good; the animations and texture quality are above average, but nothing mind blowing. The sound quality isn't bad and the police AI, whilst on their own fairly easy and slightly stupid are formiddable enemies and can easily overwhelm a robber in numbers if he is not cautious.   A criticism I can make is that you will be playing missions multiple times, because making loads of them is hard however I never found myself getting bored by them. The game uses a clever system where certain things are randomized i.e vault locations, safe locations, keycard location, guard numbers and patrol routes, etc. So you can play a mission twice and be surprised by something there that is subtlely different.   On the actual gameplay, a hell of alot of what you're doing is guarding drills as they open safes. The safes have timers and occaisionally have to be unjammed so that you don't go running off to a small room to hide in. Once you open the safes or whatever, you will be moving bags of miscellanious loot to an escape location, this gets very tense as it is usually done under heavy enemy fire. Alot of people die during this and it becomes a choice of escaping or going back for that last bag of loot. This decision can make or break a heist.   And then there's running out of ammo, taking hostages, the stealth aspect and much more. Such as mask customization.   I have made lots of friend playing this game, and I highly reccomend you use a mic for communication between fellow players because teamwork is key to winning this game.   - Pyro",

            "review_text": "A very fun co-op shooter with leveling and a massive amount of customisation available. When I first started, closer to when it was released, I enjoyed the game - but there were many, many issues that took fun out of it. It took a long time to level up without repeating a few specific heists over and over again (Rats, anybody?), there was a lack of variety in the heists, and buying new gear was unforgiving with the way cash was split back then.  Now, most of my issues with the game are solved: it is much less grindy, with many more jobs available, and the amount of content overall has been increased hugely, to the point where I am nearing the maximum level currently available and I'm still nowhere near bored of it. The variety in difficulties available (both in the heists themselves and the difficulty settings) means there is always a new way to challenge yourself (for the vast majority of people).  There are still some problems  - I think it is now   too   easy to level, as many people level 100+ have no idea what they are doing  - there are quite a few hackers that can really ruin the fun of beating the harder jobs  - some weapons are just not as viable as others, and this only gets worse with deathwish difficulty where most people only use a few different guns  - pirchasing all the dlc is expensive unless it's on sale - the game still suffers from some instability issues.  Overall though, I think the pros outweigh the cons by a mile.  If you have any friends that like coop games, get this, and have them get it too, as playing with friends is what makes it really great (as opposed to just pretty good). Also, remember to start small with your heists - I know you may think your crack team of 4 buddies can do an overkill bank heist loud, but until you have actual experience (and decent gear/skills) you will find it not worth the effort, as low level (&lt;20) players get much less exp from harder jobs, and you may fail multiple times.

I played the game first few weeks of release and it was pretty well done and complete, very little minor bugs and those were being fixed weekly, this was amazing and my experience was great.  Man I must have been high on something when I turned on the game, because it did not feel like the Payday 2 I remember playing from levels 1 to 100.. The missions just seem like your character has just been injected with so much steroids as if you're a really twisted body builder who has quite clearly taken it too far. Then those AI seem like those pesky cow-like cops that you mowed down originally are on some heavy ♥♥♥♥ plus a ton of steroids that are f'ed up and want to just seriously kill you instead of actually taken you down! It feels like some science fiction world that is more like fantasy rather than role playing being a bank robber/criminal.  Anyway, I think this game is good, but they've obviously lost the plot and decided to keep milking it with DLC's, fair enough if that's keeping it fresh.

So in my eyes they care more about making some extra money than following through on their promise.  Gameplay-wise: Lots of things in this game that make no sense, such as:  Guards in a museum see a door to the security room is open, better call the SWAT team. Random civilian is spooked by sound of footstep, better call the SWAT team. Guard walks around for hours, never has to answer pager. THE SECOND you handcuff him, have to answer the pager, otherwise, you guessed it, SWAT team.  The game is very playable, but it gets super frustrating when an alarm sounds because of something completely irrelevant to what you are doing.  Overall would not recommend you buy this. The Devs care a whole hell of a lot more about money than they do you. Its fun until you master the whopping 10 missions to choose from.

But on August 13th 2013.(My birthday) PAYDAY 2 was released. After me buying the career criminal edition and beta I was hyped. When I first loaded in I found a world with characters,story,and most of all Fun. Connecting with new players and friends grinding and just trying to make a little cash. And the game also caused funny jokes and references to the game series, Like how Elderscrolls has jokes about n'wahs and many refreneces. Anyways getting off topic, What im saying is Overkill is apart of my life,weird im aware, But thats how I feel about the game. Overkill has not turned into a cash grab company. Sure they release DLC and sometimes have lucrative tactics of marketing but at the end of the day they are just trying to make a little bit of cash. If you complain about DLC I understand but thats why you wait for sales or wait for money. But they still give to the community. But calling Overkill a EA rip-off is offensive to what they gave for you. You might not understand what I feel about this game and how I connect to it, All im saying is give Overkill a chance, They try to make a game actually fun.

I woke up the next day exited to play again, only to join a game and the game is completely mute. Ok cool I said I'll just restart my game, restarted, created a game, no sound. hmm ok i said i'll just uninstall ALL of my mods. uninstalled all mods, verified game cache, created a game, no sound. oh ok, I said, this is a real problem now. I restarted my game and put all my mods back, created a game, oh finally i have sound, exactly 3 minutes 47 seconds into the heist no sound again, so i just decided to go and play something else. The next day i try to play it again, create a game, play for a bit, as soon as I get shot once, no sound. so again i try to fix it, removed all mods, verified game cache, create a game, no sound. Now that it has been 3 days in a row with no in game sounds I am slamming my hands on my desk wondering what I did wrong, nothing that I do fixes the problem. Today I completely reinstalled the game, created a game, no sound again. Welcome to my game dust pile payday, you had a good run... goodbye old friend.",

It's clear that Overkill no longer cares about it's customer base. They are constantly pushing out DLC packs that have massively decreased in quality over the years. And now they have added a tf2/CSGO crate system that gives players direct upgrades to the normal guns found in the base game.   I used to love this game. But after this update, i'll be uninstalling this game for good. It's clear that Overkill does not care about it's consumer base. Their lust for money appears to drive every decision they make. Their micro-transaction policies make EA look a a batch of saints. These people don't deserve your business.",

They made each level with many different ways to approach the situation; from the balls blazing angle to the sneaky beaky style, but as i said you will soon master each level and they try to hook you in with the grind of getting new weapon mods, masks, and colors/patterns for masks. Which goes back the risks of the game its to damn repeatitive to keep you going to try to get all to most of these items that they try to keep you going far.

Moving all the potential stealth skills to basically one tree makes it simple to not waste points when you want to go all out shooty.  Having the tutorial missions are also nice, even if they are a little late. I played them just to see what they were about. They at least give new players a little guidence.

It's fun. And it's still fun after 1100 hours. It doesn't bother me that they keep coming out with DLC and that the community needs to blow itself. The DLC's are not mandatory and anyone can host their own game with Host Kick abilities to keep out the riff raff.  I'm writing this during the 2016 summer sale. It's currently free, so try it. This game also has a free weekend almost every month, so if you missed it during the summer sale, wait for one of those and try it then. You don't like it, no harm done.

It is constantly being updated so you don't need to worry about getting bored, you can also ran up 2500 times with the infamy update in 2014. now you can make weapon skins, and masks skins. The mask customize system has many, and i mean MANY diffrent choices, most likely over two hundered in each section, which they are three; Material, Pattern, and Color.

Third Day : Gabe called 50 skulldozers to stop you from escaping, survive until armored military escape-copter comes. Payday : 60£ each copy of HL3, dependent on how much of time will you stay uploading at day 2, EARNING EXP: 50.000.000﻿  SPECIAL WEAPON - 'The Crowbar' will be added for free if we get enough HL fuel ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   There will be a snackbar which you can get into if you lockpick it's door for 333 secconds!  Overkill,plz add this so my life can be completed.  Game rating 666/420.  ♥♥♥ dem high priced dlcs tho  A little bit of more detail from Man Made Lemonade  Unique mission features: - All police units, including special, perform twice as good in every aspect possible (i.e. Damage, speed, etc.) because of a large stock of donuts in the Valve snackbar.  - Playing as a part of a 3-man team on this mission will cause the entire game to crash.  - Random cops come equipped with gravity guns. New abilities involve faster bag stealing, knocking off drills (Gabe's office is bound to be secure), and knocking back thrown grenades.  - All cops now use crowbars instead of knives, which increases their melee damage.   - Gabe can delay your release-from-custody time for however long he likes.  - Gabe can further delay the arrival time of the escape chopper.   - Father Grigori can appear as a sniper unit, with the health of a bulldozer .

            "review_text": "One of the best co-op experiences. Ever. Its mechanics while brutal are for the most part refined and it's a blast to play with friends. Couple problems:  1) Graphically, this game's pretty mediocre. Lot of low res textures and what not.  2) If you don't have friends to play with, the game isn't really fun.  3) There's latency issues. Nothing major, but weird and a bit annoying.  4) The company's name perfectly encapsulates their approach to DLC. There are over 30 pieces and counting. The game isn't free to play and they're working on a sequel. Sort of BS right? And the DLC is sort of required to really enjoy this game. It's good on its own but the DLC is what makes it a lot better. Your arsenal is a lot more varied, you get more perk decks, new characters with fun voicing, etc. And the heists. You probably are going to really want these. Golden Grin, Goat Sim, Point Break, and Wolf Pack heists are all pretty good. My recommendation, have one member of your group buy all the heists and have him as the designated contract host. Still shouldn't be this way. Should've clumped DLC together and only released a couple packs a year.  This game is really fun and is held back by some poor decisions and poor support on Overkill's part. They have supported it, but it's costly support and it'll rack up quite the tab. Wait until a sale to get any DLC and if you're not sure if you want Payday 2, there's events where the game goes free to play temporarily. The game is tons of fun with friends and has a beautiful combination of action and strategy. One of the best games I own.",

            "review_text": "One of the best co-op games I have ever played. Not only that it requires team-play to succeed missions but you even get more reworded that way. A must-have for co-op enthusiats and for people who are looking for some games to play with friends. It's true that this game has some cheater here and there and that sometimes the game can be pay2win (For example you need to buy DLCs for granades or rocket launchers) but overall it's an amazing game.   EDIT: When I wrote this review I tought that OVERKILL will finally decide that adding more damn DLC just to keep their pockets full is a dumb idea. Oh boy was I wrong, they are going to probably keep adding more and more DLC until our pockets are going to be empty. Luckly I've bought the game and some DLC when it was at a discount of 75% so I did not lose that much money, but I feel that the developers are going downhill with this game slowly but surely. You probably look at my game hours and think 'this guy has no idea what he's talking about' but trust me I do. I've played Payday: The Heist and Payday 2 before I got it on this account. The game concept used to be so cool. Finally you are a bad guy with a team robbing banks.   As I said before this game is almost unplayble now, microtransactions everywhere, ♥♥♥♥inf DLC's that you'll probablt buy for a single item (WHICH COST'S 5$ FFS). I have aproximately 60% of the DLC and to be fair I got bored really quick even if I had more content then the game originally offers. The missions get repetative and some of them are going to be a waste of time later on when you have a higher level, not only that it won't give you enough cash but the experience is just laughable at. I am currently level 96 in the game and I only had one task when I started playing again: becoming infamous. I use to spend 4 hours every-single-♥♥♥♥ing-day trying to level up. And you probably guessed it, I had only some missions that would've helped me level up and those started to make my head hurt since I've done the same missions over and over again.  At this point I don't even feel like starting to play again. If I said that there are some cheaters here and there then you bet I was right. I've encountered ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of hackers/cheaters coming in to some other dude's lobby and they wouldn't even kick them. I think that the security is really stupid in the game, most of the lobbies don't have the option of kicking cheaters from the game neither a kicking vote to kick afk players or toxic ones. And yes there are toxic players in this game as well, a game which meant to be a cooperitive game damn it. And their reasons are just the dumbest one's ever. For example you get downed accidently 'OMFG NOOB CAN'T YOU HANDLE YOURSELF?' or when you fall by mistake 'ARE YOU REALLY THAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?'. But some of the most annoying persons for me are those who kick you if you made a mistake or jdging by yor level:   LVL under the lobbies creator? KICK. ( Yeah cause my lvl determines how well I play)  Messed up in an stealth mission? KICK. ( I didn't make that intentionally)  Not taking what perks somebody wants? KICK. ( Am I supposed to play how you want me?)  Not somebody that the rest knows? KICK. ( Make your lobby friends-only ffs)  And last but not least is the god damn difficulty of some missions. Some damn missions are hard AF and if you don't buy DLC to help you win (Pay2Win FTW BOYZ) or you did not unlock weapon mods that make your gun to be on damn steroids then it has no use because unless you aren't a pro you won't be able to pass it.  This game really isn't the same as it used to be since OVERKILL really messed up, they even said before 'We won't have any sort of micro-transactions', yeah right you don't.  My opinion is that if you really want to buy this game, convince other friends to buy it too so you can play with them and wait for a discount cause this game takes the example from EA Games which is sad.",

UPDATE: And far from reacting in any positive way to the overwhelmingly negative feedback of their recent actions, Overkill have elected to instead double-down on screwing over their long-term fans and supporters (as well as anyone else still stupid enough to keep giving them money) by adding money/XP boosts to the already maligned skins and ALSO giving players who spent $20 on a special DLC with the promise of a 'unique' and 'cosmetic' reward *ONE* out of a possible *TWENTY-FIVE* of the terrible things.  This game used to be great.

Dont ever get close to it if u dont have friends willin to play with you, or you dont want to experience long adventure (that includes weeks of dealing with cheaters, server problems, being kicked 24/7) of finding a good team. If, by any chance, u have friends (yeah, sure) or u find a good team, then u gonna have a blast. And when u start complaining, you'll know it becasue u care. EDIT: After many hours spend in the game all I can say is that its in my eyes its the pinnacle of incompetence in the history of gaming. So much so that I decided to edit my review and after complaining about the game for so many years I no longer can find good words to express the disgust i have with it. Everything, from the way developer treats the players, the fact that the game still won't close when you click exit game, the pathetic excuse of an engine they use which looks awful, dont support AA and perfoms worse then Ubisoft ports, the worst skin implementation in the history of gaming (you can make better stuff in paint in 5 seconds), the lack of any PR support ,the fact that every Dev update looks like they're playing cat and mouse game with you, the mistreat of console users, the massive let-downs they deliver on every freaking turn (Infamy 2.0 , Crimefest, HypeTrain, most of the latest dlcs). This game had a potential to become one of the best coop experiences ever, in the end it became watching circles while clicking at enemies while the developers plan their Mobile port, Korea version and promise more goat simulator dlc for another 2 years.",

I don't know what the developers have done, but somehow they've done an excellent job at turning Payday 2 into the slowing updating app you will ever find.  Not only does the update take hours on a good net connection just to download 300mb, but it completely and utterly destroys your hard disk and your PC's usability at the same time.  It has a habit of using 100% of your hard drive to download any size file. Obviously, this causes lag like you have never seen. Not sure if I have Windows 10 or Windows 98 when Payday 2 starts updating. It just utterly destroys your entire PC for the entire time it updates. Your PC will barely even be useable for browsing social media.  Other than that, it's a pretty fun game but I have found it pretty confusing and difficult to get started because you just get thrown in the deep end and the higher level players just shout abuse at you for being bad.  Would be cool if more players performed heists on the sly - most of the time your team just goes in fully kitted up with armour and just starts shooting everyone.  But seriously, if this damn game spends any longer pre-allocating and destroying my hard disk I'm gonna get real mad. I have like 800GB free hard disk space and I could still do 3 return trips to the shops in the time it takes to download and install a 50mb update.  I don't recommend this game mainly because you'll spend more time updating and raging than you ever will actually playing the game.",

Backing it up a bit, Payday 2 plays on a few gaming elements: randomization, risk vs reward and crisis management. This is pretty much a co-op heist game with a twist. There are so many elements to cover, I won't even scratch the surface here. However, if you are a solo kinda player, you can also enjoy Payday 2 with stealth. In fact, stealth is encouraged on some maps where its possible. There is a bit of a learning curve to start with other than knowing where the enemies are at any given time but, once you have that under your belt, fortune favors the brave and you will need to bring your balls of steel to pull of big heists successfully. And then, you need to survive. There are 5 levels of difficulty to start with: Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Overkill and Deathwish. They are aptly and correctly labelled for your levelling pleasure, as you gain XP and money for weapons, mods, etc. The hardest part on ANY game mode is not being too greedy and knowing when to bail. Then, once you get to level 100, you can gain an infamy level. Think Prestiege for you Call of Duty types and you have an idea. However, Infamy brings better rewards and much better paydays. Does a $24M payday sound awesome? Well, you have to work for it.  If you play the Demo and you keep hungering for more once you have mastered that, then get the game and DLC ASAP!  Payday 2 has me hooked and is very addictive. Can be frustrating if you rush it. Patience is a virtue here. Also, trying to remember where things are: cameras, civilians, enemies to aviod, locked doors, etc.  The community is VERY active, alive and passionate about this game and rightly so. Overkill has done a great job here and keeps listening to the community. One of the VERY FEW devs that still pay attention to their fanbase.  I have absolutely NO hesitation in recommending this game to anyone and if you have friends on steam, up to 4 players can play at a time. Or you can PUG it, whichever.  I haven't even begun to scratch the surface here (70+ hours in &lt; 2 weeks as of this review) and it still draws me in. Get some Payday 2 action today!",

            "review_text": "Relase review:   'This game is unfinished, glitchy, more bugged than a bethesda game, lack of content and promised features, yet, its one of the most addictive games i have seen in a long time. Best part is that hackers wont bother you because this aint no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PvP'    Nowadays the game is ♥♥♥♥ed. Sure, they have been relasing content, for wich i am glad, but the fact that OVER HALF THE WEAPONS are DLC, 5/6 out of 11/12 characters are DLC, and that all DLC costs over 5 times the price of the game, plus the seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fanbase and rude community made me uninstall the game, since most of the weapons that makes Deathwish (max difficulty) do-able are behind paywalls. However, after the recent relase of stat-changing lootdrop weapons, i am the most dissapointed.  CSGO was MADE around the concept of having crates and weapon skins. And i was NOT happy when TF2 did it, since the hat economy was fine and i really liked the way weapons worked. Their lastest update only made it seem like they REALLY wanted to capitalize on the money from CSGO skins that there already is, wich i really disagree on.  But this? Not only this seems like a cashgrab, but if you honestly put a lot of money into buying crates and 'drills' (keys) You can actually find stats upgrades for your guns. Not related to skills, upgrades, or anything. Just cards that you get for paying. This, while not EXACTLY a 'Pay 2 Win' service, is scratching the surface of it, even after the devs claimed at game relase that they would never even dare to make the game P2W.  Even i acknowledge that this idea would hurt more on games like TF2 or CSGO since they are PvP, but the idea that the game just makes the game easier depending on how much money you throw at the devs (and this was true just with the DLC) is a statement to how Overkill has gone to ♥♥♥♥ with DLC.   If we want to look at WHERE this problem began, it began with the first Gage weapons pack, one of the first DLC for the game, where they would give you weapons that were in the game in the first payday, and an entirely new class of weapons, behind a DLC. Adding light machineguns meant making sure that players cannot use drum magazines for their rifles again, so that they are forced to buy their DLC. This has been going on with the game for 2 years, from weapon packs like the medieval and western ones providing with cool but unnecesary guns that you didn't had to get, but you could if you wanted interesting challenges and to look great, to providing DLC that would make the game far easier (like the sniper pack, wich would bring a sniper weapon that could kill skulldozers in less than 3 shots) and it would make the job harder for those who dont have the DLC. The relase of Grenades, Molotovs, Dynamite, and so on as DLC is only more concrete evidence that Overkill is just unaware of what makes a good DLC. They try to relase as much new content as possible without ever thinking about how there has been little to no free content DLC other than a few heists and less than 5 guns. This has lead to seeing how DLC melee weapons are over 3/4 of the weapons of that category, and having 1/2 of the primary weapons (usually the best) behind, also, DLC.   I didn't think Overkill was trying to do this just for the sake of being money grabbers, but i think they just dont know how to make DLC, and instead of trying to figure out what makes a good DLC, they just keep making more. These Stat-changing cards for weapons are the cherry on top of the cake. Actually selling items that upgrade your weapon.   Its a shame to see how bad the game has gotten ever since it got relased, back when your biggest complaints was your unavailability to move hostages and the fact that customizable safe houses was a relase-date promised feature (AND HOLY ♥♥♥♥! THEY STILL HAVEN'T ADDED THAT!)  It doesn't help that the game is STILL buggy, crashes a lot, and there are a lot of screencaps of people claiming to get banned from the HUB discussion for no reason other than complaining about the game's recent actions.",

Keeping the four player heist action from the first game, it improves on some of the features from the first game, like talent trees to customize your play style and stealth missions, while bringing in some new aspects, like weapon and mask customization. However, the game has been lacking on 'grand' heists like the ones from the first game until the recent release of the Big Bank DLC. But anyone can play the DLC missions without buying them as long as someone in the game lobby has bought it, which is one of the fairest DLC policies I've seen. On top of that, there are also a few heists, like Shadow Raid and Election Day, which are completely free! This game is definitely worth picking up if you have a few friends to play with, especially when it goes on sale.",

There are plenty of heists to play and they even change from time to time so they are never the same, good point. The only backdraw is the AI. I know that this was intended to be a coop shooter, but the AI companions... Brainless demigodish characters who don't shot the enemy and only can be killed by the whole National Guard shooting at them. Overall, I tottaly recommend it, just wait for a sale because 29,99 euros are to expensive for my Central-European wallet. ;)",

For newcommers, this game explores the ideas and complications of  robbing banks, jewelry stores, handling drugs and even more extreme situations. Play online with up to 3 additional freinds in co-op mode to plan all your  activities with the ability to purchase assets such as camera feeds, advanced get-away drivers and mission specific perks. Customize your guns according to plan, with Assault Rifles ranging from reliable common military and police rifles to heavy hitting sniper rifles. Bring your barrel attachements, extended clips and scopes to knock the police force down with thunder-shaking gun fights. Or sneak in through the back with silencers and attachements to help your concealment. Build your own character to suit your needs by mastering your choice of skill trees, each extended with distinctive class specific features to help you more play your way. Level up with your freinds, reaching a cap of 100. For those familiar with the original payday, Heists range from a one day jewelry heist to a 3 day job to frame a senator. Heists are varied but all provide a payday for you and your freinds if successfully completed, allowing you a chance at a random item after every mission. I really enjoyed the first payday when it came out, seeing this sequal I waited all summer for it to come out and have not been dissapointed. With no more 9 seperate layouts with the core game I can understand alot of opinions of this becoming repetative, I myself ended up purchasing the add-ons currently availible for the game because I enjoyed it enough to want to see more content, I liked the new weapons and the new missions we have are fun; I look forward to more add-on content for the game. I do still experience a few bugs and glitches which is expected as patches and updates are still continuing to roll out. But otherwise My personal opinion is that Payday 2 provides a unique experience only offered by OVERKILL until GTA5 get's there heisting online.   3/11/14 This game is awful. dont waste your money.",

I def liked the customization in this game, there are millions of mask colors, materials , etc. and weapon configurations that you can make. However, to make this game interesting, the developers have made these customizations to be dropped after every game. I also liked that they are different tree sets for different classes, this will allow for diversity in the team. It is certainly a fantastic game to play with friends. However, it gets boring after some time of playing if you do not have any friends around playing with you. I do reccomend this game if you have friends playing it.",

At it's core it's an amazing game with fun heists, lots of cool weapons, great teamplay mechanics. and it runs quite smoothly (I have a 750 ti as of making this). What are my two downsides? The game crashes way to often than it should and there are way too many DLCs. Of course some of the DLCs are pretty good but almost next to none are really worth the full price (especially the hiest DLCs as you can play them without buying them and the only reason I see to get them is for the items they give you). And the crashing can be extremely annoying when it happens during or when I'm just about to join a game. I really can't understand how a game that's been out this long can be this buggy. Though, I really only find it a little inconvience. And when the DLCs are on sale (which I often see going for 75% off when it is) then throwing in a buck for some cool new content can be worth it. All in all I highly recommend this game as even with the DLC and bugs aside it's still a really fun game especially with your friends. My one tip I highly recommend is wait for a sale when getting anything from this game. Mabye not for the full game (that's your choice) but definately for the DLC. After all that I give this game a thumbs up.",

The game is very well rounded in how you can play, you can solo some maps and others it is very hard to do so but not impossible. I will say however that this game is meant for groups of people to work as a team to take down banks and blow up meth labs. In terms of replayability this game has it, I have played several maps more than 20 times and they still don't get old, everytime you load a map it can change a little, that is not to say you cant load the same map and have it look exacly the same as the last time you played it but this is unlikely since most maps have multiple locations that things can spawn. The DLC content is also very rich, the feature that I AM SO SO VERY greatful for is that OVERKILL does NOT and I repeat DOES NOT require all player to have the DLC for a group of friends where one has it and the others do not the person that owns the DLC just has to host the game and the others are able to play that DLC map. Very Very cool feature and I am very happy with this DEV and game. Keep it up. Thank you for Reading. Happy Heisting.",

I play it quite often, and have worked hard to make sure friends have it as well, even if they hate it. It's everything I've ever wanted in a co-op FPS, from the killer soundtrack, to the tight gunplay. Every weapon type feels so different, and each weapon in the archetypes is unique as well, which is a hard feat, considering how often weapons are added. The classes all have uses, varying from sneaky silent stabbing to decimating the police force in DC with very, very large guns. Maps are reused sometimes, notably the four different heists that set their stage at the same bank, but I've personally never had an issue with it, considering how often I vary between stealth and loud play. A lot of the vanilla game heists are a bit small in size, but a few are rather crazy, and DLCs top them very easily. Now, I know DLC is often frowned upon, but Overkill has gone out of their way to accomodate for people without money. Anyone can heist, no matter the heist, since clients can join DLC maps free of charge, and only miss out on cosmetics and one or two new weapons. The characters are sometimes bland, but I've loved them since release, from the classic sound of Wolf's psychotic screaming, or Dallas calling everyone 'buddy', to the new friends we've made, Houston and his love of food, and John Wick's enjoyment of the number 1. In short, it's not a game for everyone. But if you have a group of friends you enjoy, or don't mind meeting some, Payday 2 is a brilliant game, with many hundreds of hours worth of playtime waiting for your crew to tackle.   Take care, and keep those helmets flying! -Chi",

            "review_text": "Payday 2 is a blast, but if you haven't played it with your friends, then you haven't played it!  The AI teammates, while not horrible, are kind of limited. Sure, they'll shoot at enemies and pick you up, but they won't subdue civilians or crack that safe for you, so real people are key. Nothing like you and three of your homies throwing on your masks at the same time and doing what needs to be done. Learning the missions can be time consuming and fun, but there's nothing like a 5 minute mission with max loot and no cops. Having friends to manage guards, civilians, alarms, cameras, safes, doors, or anything else you need is what makes this game great. I've been lucky enough to have an enthusiastic (and artistic) crowd controller, a heavy armor/guns that never stealths (he likes to chill across the street in full gear until needed), a ghost that can walk through the buildings and find what we need while marking what to avoid, and myself the safe/door cracker. Combine those roles with some great dialogue and humor and you've got an entire weekend that never gets dull.  Payday has also done an excellent job of providing a full game while enticing you to buy more. You can purchase weapon packs that do not give you the weapons, but allows you to earn them. Same goes even more so with masks. There are a variety of masks to wear and each can be customized with patterns, colors, and materials, and all of that (masks and customizers) has to be earned from post-heist rewards. The post-heist rewards are also how to earn weapon customizations, such as stocks, barrels, grips, scopes, and more, they've got achievement based unlocks that just add that much more, and they sell mission packs that allow you to host new and different heists, but if you don't have the pack and a friend does, you can still play with them on that heist as long as they host! Brilliant!  So if you like socializing, strategizing, smashing, and grabbing then there's a good chance this game is for you. If you don't like to earn your upgrades or you don't play well with others, then you might want to pass on this one.  TL;DR - This game is fun if you're not alone and you like grinding for gear and upgrades.",

One bug is where you throw grenades, molotovs, or use grenade launcher, only to hit the invisible walls near you, and then you get damaged, burned, killed, and not able to damage the enemies around you. Played Santa's Workshop for two hours, with 135 bags solo, only for team bots to glitch, and not able to walk upstairs to revive me, after a cloaker glitched as well, kicking me down as it was floating up against the wall. Another annoying glitch is where you play the Golden Grin Casino heist on stealth, were sometimes the cops can glitch and spot you through the wall many feet away, after you spend a lot of time into the game of course. Then I decided to try Santa's workshop again, restarting about 30 times, so the elves wouldn't be upstairs to avoid the glitch, then another glitch popped up were my armor was taking about 20 seconds to regenerate, when it should have been regenerating every 5 seconds when not getting damaged. Of course, failed again because of another glitch, and then lost my 25% exp bonus for quitting, just to make sure that I had my armorer deck, and all regenerating armor skills, to find out that I did. Be nice if they had more helpful skills for the one down difficulty, besides the messiah skill, when all you are doing is constantly going down, and relying on luck to get automatically revived to beat the heist, without running out of charges. The infamy tree is mostly lame, and could be better offering more different rewards, like improving more skills to help you stand a chance against the one down difficulty, than mostly exp boosts and a few masks. There is no point ranking up after the V infamous rank, with all your 10% less requirement skill trees, if all it offers are more exp boosts, just to help you rank a little bit faster. A XXV infamous rank should be better than a V infamous rank. The weapons should be balanced, not always the same powerful bows, crossbows, snipers, and grenade launchers, just to beat the higher difficulties. Sniping would have been more fun, if you can snipe faster, and if the ammo drops were the same, as for the lesser weapons with the ammo specialist skills. Same thing for the bows. They should make shooting bows quicker, since there are many enemies out on the map on higher difficulties. I'm tired of using the same grenade launcher to kill multiple enemies at once. A laser dot sight on the bows would have been nice also, since aiming is a bit difficult. If you want this game, then you need lots of patience, and hopefully the irritating glitches will be fixed. The updates are nice, but they take up a lot of space, and may slow your computer down.",

What other game lets you take a mini gun and rocket launcher to a stealth mission and gives you an achievement for it? I always find myself saying, 'One more job' and I always find my friends saying, “You said that 3 jobs ago”.   PayDay 2 has been on discount very often recently so I REALLY recommend picking it up and a few of the core DLC ie. Courier Pack and a few weapons packs, character packs if you like who they are and what they do and you only need one person to own the job packs so get that deep pocketed, collect it all, friend of yours to pick this up and you’re all set.

Payday is already for quiet a while a Pay 2 Win Game but it wasnt that bad cause you bought the DLCs anyway and you got some cool new Stuff and Missions and if you waited long enough you could buy them for not even 2€. The problem is Overkill is trying to make Payday like CS GO with Gun Skins and microtransactions, the only difference is that these Skins effect the weapons stats and can change the Game. So instead of fixing some of the Millions of Bugs the Game got (cause its a mod based on the Half Life Engine), they add new ways to get money and now they even started to delete our Negativ feedback on the Community side of the Game. So now iam here changing my Review from i love this Game to i hate you Overkill, stop that ♥♥♥♥ and make Payday become Payday again.  The Game itself is still great (still buggy but fun with friends) but this money farming by Overkill is getting anoying so iam sorry i cant recommend buying it at the moment.

It is vastly superior if you play with friends and organise your play, as you can work together to achieve better money-making schemes. There is a wide range of weapon and character customisation (through weapon addons, masks that your character wears and a fairly large skill point system that you can reset at any time!) which ensures that you will be able to do neat things. Some of the crime jobs (called heists) are more fun than others, but this is open to an individual's interpretation. There are also a number of difficulty levels which escalate the enemy response dramatically, but also increase the rewards. Completion of a heist gives a reward in addition to money and XP - sometimes a weapon part, a new mask or one of the safes (collections of unique weapon skins that can be sold in steam marketplace)  Overall if you want a co-op based crime game where you can steal things, do crimes and shoot wacky guns then get this.",

            "review_text": "PAYDAY 2 is my most played game on steam, and definitely one of my favourite games of all time, that being said I would give this game an 8/10. Although the previous sentence may seem like a contradiction, 'How could it be one of your favourite games of all time and only give it an 8/10', well the answer is simple, the price.  Dlc/Microtransactions:  Now, I have no problem paying for dlcs, but there's a certain point where it gets a bit ridiculous, again, I'm fine paying $5 every 1 or 2 months for some dlc, I mean, it's cheaper than Netflix, but when they start adding things like 'ak/car mod pack', I feel like they are grasping at straws for unique dlcs, I mean come on, it adds like 8 mods, how is that worth real money?  My personal feelings aside, for new players, it isn't a montly fee, it's a down payment, and a hefty one at that, $100+ dollars. If any new players want to get all the dlc I would recommend waiting for a sale, or buy them on ♥♥♥ at about half the price (I have always bought them while on sale). However, that is still $50 and this is the main problem I have with this game, how much money is required to play the full game.  This was only worsened by the release of the black market skin update, a system that not only added microtransactions but also gave the skins you bought with microtransaction a chance to have a stat boost. This was later rectified, but it still happened, and it really seemed like a huge cash grab. They still have skins, but they are acquired for free in game, and don't require keys to open the boxes anymore.  Game:  In my opinion, the game is amazing, there is a lot of replayability (with dlc) and it is even better with friends, the game has grown so much since launch, they have added 12 characters, and many maps, such as: robbing a moving train, stealing warheads, stealing money from a rave, jumping out of a plane to catch cash, stealing goats with coke inside, looting during an earthquake, cooking endless (yes literally) amounts of meth, breaking someone out of prison then killing the person who put him there and even a mission where you have thugs dressed in elf costumes pack cocaine for you, so you can throw it down a chimney to secure it (also goes as long as you can last).  Over time they have also added many free weapons, some even better than dlc weapons, such as the white streak and baby deagle, as well as many free characters including: John Wick, the hitman from the movie John Wick, Bonnie, a Scottish version of big boo from Orange is the New Black, Hoxton, one of the original fan favourites of the first game, Bodhi, the leader of the ex-presidents and professional surfer bro from the movie Point Break, and Jimmy the coke hungry savage from Hardcore Henry. All the free content almost makes up for the dlc... almost.  However, the absolute best feature of this game, is the sound. The music is phenomenal, and really creates an intense atmosphere for any situation and you can even create your own playlist of songs in the sound menu. The guns are also great, the noise they make and overall the sheer amount of them is amazing. Shotguns can even be loaded with different types of ammo which imapact the mechanics of the gun (Shotgun DLC only).  Conclusion:  I really wish I could give it a 10/10 but due to the DLC and microtransactions, I can't, for each of these I have docked 1 point leaving the total at 8/10, the game is fantastic and definitely worth it, especially if you have a friend that has all of the DLCs or just friends that have the game as well.   tl;dr:  Game is great, dlc is expensive, microtransactions were a mistake, later corrected.  Happy Heisting :)   A message to new players:  - Please remember these tips if you are a new player, in stealth, when you kill a guard you   have to hold f on his dead body, or else the pager operator will know he's dead, you can only   do this 4 times.   - You can shoot open wood and metal doors that have glass on them, not the solid steel ones.   - You can be detected with your mask off if you bump into a guard.  - Shooting cameras, will cause a guard to go check what's wrong with it.  - Compensators and Flash hiders don't silence your guns, only suppressors do.  - Please ask if it's stealth before you join, and if it is, ask if it's ok to join before you do   because you might spawn in a bad spot and cause the mission to fail.  - Inspire is an ability that allows you to instantly revive teammates from a distance, it isn't  hacking  - Feign death and messiah are both abilities that allow the user to revive themselves, this also   isn't hacking  - Swan song is an ability that allows the user to walk around for 9 seconds with infinite ammo  before they go down, their health will appear empty, but this is also not hacking  - Don't kick someone because they are hacking, unless you've asked them if they are hacking,  then if they make something up, or say they are, then kick them.   - Progressing is the fun of this game, don't let hackers boost your level to XXV-100 (max level).  - Roman numerals represents an infamy level (prestige if you play COD), don't assume  someones worse because their level is XXV-10, that isn't level ten that's level 2510.  - Don't be an abusive host, don't kick people if they're a higher level and not listening to you,   just listen to them and they might teach you something, if someone is being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥   however, feel free to kick him right before the escape :D",

What would be interesting to play would be a game made by developers that not only care about their community but will also keep micro-transactions out of their game and hopefully pull their head out of their ♥♥♥ since it's been stuck in there for some time now. While there is some free DLC and the choice to buy any DLC you choose, it almost feels forced if you want to play any more brand new heists. The amount of DLC that Overkill has made for this game could have been easily made into a Payday 3 so in turn releasing over 20 DLC's for this game wouldn't be considered a ♥♥♥♥ move by some people.   This is a good game not including the DLC but to not listen to your community is like putting rat poison into your drink every morning and then questioning yourself or asking others why you feel bad after doing so. Please stop being ♥♥♥♥♥.  I would only get this game if it was on sale. You should also wait a bit and think before doing so even if it's on sale.",

            "review_text": "Genre: FPS/Crime 8/10  Story/Gameplay: Not much of a story in the Payday universe. You're part of a crew of robbers who are hired by contractors to pull of heists for money. The heists differ in difficulty and how long they can go on for. Some heists can be done in a matter of a few minutes to getting close to 40 minutes. All depending if things go well of course, which they most likely won't. If you're a beginner to Payday, play with some experienced friends. Not only will they teach you the best combinations of weapons and what to do during heists, but also leveling up and gaining money will be a lot easier.  Visuals: Payday 2 is a huge step above from Payday: The Heist. The visuals are much more moderned and detailed. Masks look great, weapons look great and each have their own reload animations, maps look great. Hell even the gloves on your hands look great. GEM mod enhancement for Payday 2 gives some more detail to the game all while removing some annoying features that may give you a slight headache from the base game. Using the mod is allowed by Overkill and you won't be banned from the Payday 2 community group.  Sounds / Voice Acting: Not much to say besides the game sounds absolutely amazing. Each weapon has their own sounds and the quality is fantastic. Sounds of gunfire differ incredibly from being indoors or outside or even far from where a gunfight is going on. Voice acting is also great, nothing sounds awkward and each character has different lines to give them their own unique personality.  For 30 dollars, this is definitely a great game to buy. When it's on sale down to 10 dollars or so, it's a MUST BUY. There are some DLC that add weapons and new heists to the game along with new masks. It's all on you if you want to buy them or not. Don't worry though, you can still play these heists! Overkill is pretty great that they allowed it so even if you do not have these dlc heists, you can still play with friends who are hosting the new heists. You may not unlock masks and weapons from certain dlc achievements but it's still a great way to test out the new maps before buying.   Crimefest is currently going on, meaning if you join the Payday 2 group, you help everyone else apart of the group to score free dlc! We currently have enough people to unlock a brand new major DLC and new character (Old Hoxton from Payday:The Heist) for free for everyone who is apart of the Payday 2 group. So even if you don't have the game, join the group if you want to help your friends gain free dlc! ",

            "review_text": "'Great game, no words for describing. Just great.' that was my opinion before the Crimefest II. I actually wouldn't give a f*ck if the skins would just upgrade the look of the gun. I WOULD. The skins add bonuses and you, of course need to pay your money from the PAYDAY (got the joke?) to get a stability bonus. I also wouldn't care because of these openings, if the Overkill didin't say that there will be no micro-transactions. But whatever, let's talk about the game: it's a little bit P2W, but not that much that you can't stealth. Of course, you have silencers, of course you have guns with high concealment (F2P concealment 30, DLC concealment 30) and of course you have skills for stealth. But when you buy some DLCs, let the skulldozers to hide before penetrating their skull with Thanatos .50, and burn the shields with the flamethrower. There are achievments, which should make you busy for a while. Going loud is as good as killing zombies in Left 4 Dead 2. You need to fight with nightmares you never dreamt of: Cloakers, bulldozers, HEADLESS bulldozers, shields, snipers, tasers, cpt. Winters, FBIs, SWATs, SWAT Van Turrets, hostage rescue teams and anything that fights against crime. Going stealth is the best, that's why you can f*ck it up almost everytime. Stealth Bonus for next contract, securing loot without disturbance, you can take a break almost everytime BUT it hasn't got the Lord Viklund's BADASS MUSIC. Actually, without looking at the skins, the game deserves 8/10. Good to play.",

However, a lot of things have changed since the game's release.  I found myself writing a negative review because of game developers. All this DLC craze is starting to get ridiculous - new content is introduced every month and 9 times out of 10 you need to pay for it. The biggest problem is that many DLCs are overpriced and useless. Overkill simply adds 1 or 2 weapons plus some masks and charges $5 for it. Needless to say, you will have a big advantage over other players if you purchase weapon DLCs and I find that unfair.  The biggest dissapoint was introdused this week which is micro transactions. Overkill gave their word they will not implement anything like that, but I guess the money is far more important than game fans. Purchasing weapon skins in market gives you a tremendous advantage, because applying skins also increases your weapon stats.  Simply put, Overkill is just milking this game like a cow in order to make the most profit possible. I must say I completely stopped playing it because of Pay-to-Win policy. All I wanted was to rob banks, but instead I'm being robbed by developers.  The game - 9/10 Soundtrack - 10/10 EA.. oh.. I mean Overkill Studio - 0/10",

            "review_text": "Quickly take note that I haven't played any PAYDAY 2 within the past two weeks due to being busy and lazy most of my time, but I do keep up to date on the news that OVERKILL puts out.  I've enjoyed PAYDAY 2 since its release, yet I am very inconsistent with playing it, same with other games I own due to doing other things with my spare time. But here's my review and thoughts of recent and past events.  PAYDAY 2's release was hyped and for very good reason. It had all the features the original game didn't have, had amazing graphics and different mechanics within each of the heists and lots of customization which every gamer loves doing and was a big step up from the first game.  (I wont talk about this next paragraph a whole lot as it does get boring and we all knew that this was the golden age for PAYDAY 2)  PAYDAY 2 was soaring through the Hot Sellers tab on the store and was doing positively well with mini updates, almost endless new DLC updates, hotfixes and bug fixes for the next two years and almost everyone who had the game knew this, and OVERKILL was walking down the correct path for a successful game (which it was and still is) and kept on looking for things to release and show the community with the passion they had.  Whilst walking down the path of success OVERKILL tripped over a set of rocks spelling out the word... 'micro-transactions'.  The Black Market/micro-transaction update from last years crimefest was very very disappointing, releasing skins and mods to try make a bit more money on top of all the DLC that OVERKILL was creating at that time which was between £2 - £5/$3 - $6 which people only really bought on sale as it went down by 75% for such a better deal. Pitchforks went to OVERKILL's necks and asked why they did this update on such a great game that didn't even need micro-transactions, reddit threads and gaming news reporters went crazy over it publishing the update wherever and whenever they had the chance.  What made this so disappointing and was one of the main things that annoyed people about the update was that all the grinded hours people put into this game, was all wasted for a couple of coins and notes from their own, or parents bank accounts or maybe some sold their CSGO skins for PAYDAY skins or just had some money leftover in their steam wallet. All in all it was devastating that grinded hours went to waste.  It was a down low for OVERKILL, for the next 7-8 months they saw many of its players uninstall the game, un-favorited it from their steam library or just left it with blue text saying 'update queued' and they was not doing anything about it. For me however I still enjoyed it and so did everyone who ignored the update, but the game did feel like a big part of it was taken out. Less players to play the game with, more people showing off their skins (which some are nice don't get me wrong) and from my personal experience, a lot more hackers which eventually killed all the fun I had for the game and eventually sadly uninstalled it.  With losing many players and fans and getting negative reviews almost everywhere on the internet about the update, OVERKILL had done what the fans never dreamed or wanted. However...  With update 100's release near the start of June, the nightmare of micro-transactions turned into a dream full of free stuff and bonuses and OVERKILL have re-gained the trust of the community, became independent by buying the IP from 505 Games and once again, became a badass game with a lot more new players.  Opening safes will be free, items inside and the safes themselves are all still available to purchase, sell and trade but it does save you the extra 2ish dollars. Would of been cool to have all the items non sell-able but then the people who have actually bought skins/safes/drills with their own money would of gone to waste and I totally understand this action.  Additionally OVERKILL said that they are working hard to make PAYDAY 2 what it was again and i'm looking forward to seeing what they are going to create for us in the future.  OVERKILL salutes us, and the community salutes you!   Oh and should you buy the game? In my opinion yes, and the community's opinion... Yes.",

And with the large amount of friendly co-operative players (usually) it makes for an enjoyable experience even if you're friends are offline or don't want to play. It may not run well on the older pc's but its understandable, running from an older pc with integrated graphics card myself I've got the lowest settings I possibly can and I'm still finding it enjoyable doesn't look that bad either to be truthfall. The AI director in this game is insane, it allows for a fresh experience with different objectives located at random locations each time. A prime example being the safes are never usually in one place on Four Stores they're spread out amongst the stores.  The AI teamates won't help you with objectives they're only for the extra guns which can be helpful. But a pain the buttocks when you're constantly running around trying to get bags on solo and you'd wish for them to pick them up to help. But thats why this game is better with other players as it's a more profitable and enjoyable experience. I wouldn't consider this game pay-to-win either as I own both the armoured dlc and gages weapon pack but yet the guns stats are fair so you won't have an over powered gun as in most cases it'll limit your ammo. If you want value for money I'd say this is a must, it offers great gameplay, amazing visuals, fair progressing of character, randomised mission objectives and placement of vehicles etc. If you haven't already bought it i'd recommend getting it soon.

Playing this game with three other friends is definitely a lot of fun and the amount of customization is fairly extensive for this sort of game. However, the grinding aspect kills a lot of the longevity of the game if you want to invest a lot of time into it. Unlocking customization items like masks and gun parts is largely dependent on post-mission RNG, so being able to really kit out a favorite gun could be an egregiously long process given the odds of a specific gun part dropping for you. Additionally, since the differences between rushing heists and 100%ing them or stealthing them are negligible in terms of benefits (despite recent patches that alter this slightly), a lot of the uniqueness and novelty of completing some of the missions fades away very quickly when you reach the ~60ish player rank due to having to grind so much.  The combination of having to repeat certain reward-heavy missions to progress within the endgame of player level and the diminishing returns (and, ergo, satisfaction) of the actual fun parts of the game makes the game somewhat of a chore if you really want to sink a lot of time into this game.  If you're looking for a game to play with friends once in a while, Payday 2 is great. There's a solid amount of free and paid DLC that comes out fairly regularly. Definitely worth it if it's on sale. But if you're really looking for something to sink your teeth into over a long period of time, be aware of the downright offensive amounts of grinding and RNG necessary to really get all up ins on this game can be more than a little off-putting.",

The gunplay is spot on, melee isn't clunky to use, co-op gameplay is the best, each map has fantastic level design, with randomly selected locations for most objectives keeping the game fresh every playthrough. There are a ton of guns, customization, masks to customize, the works.  My only gripe, is the friendly AI is stupid, flat out. Buuuuuut if you have a crew that isn't even an issue.

There are many DLCs, it's true, but without them this game is still giving me so much fun, and you can buy every DLC for about 1 euro when they are on promotion, so this is very good deal. I bought like 6 DLC just from selling items from other games (like CS:GO) that I got for free. Developers are really listening to community (confirms this fact that they instantly went to fix bug that showed up in the newest patch that is crashing the game, just because community spammed on the discussion steam forum and when they will fix they will give us free bonus exp for limited amount of time), but community is still breaking their heart. It is sad. But still, I recommend this game to everyone, but better find a friend that could explain you the basics of the game or watch awesome Youtubers like M0rtifer, b33croft or GeneralMcBadass.  UPDATE 1: Game is patched and finally is not crashing, everything is working properly. Developers gave us another free drill and safe, new free masks and bonus exp for couple of weeks.  UPDATE 2: Many things has changed about Payday 2 Development, the most important is that devs finally got all publishers rights from other company and now they have deleted all the microtransactions.

The skill trees each bring something useful and welcome to the game, and there have been improvements to each tree to make them more viable, and useful for the number of skill points that they require.  I purchased this game at release and I feel that I have already gotten my money's worth. Hopefully the game will be opened up to the Steam Workshop (the developers have said this is a possibility) for heist creation.

With several updates coming out all the time it keeps getting new content, but that doesn't fix the other problems. The gunplay, masks, and coop aspects are the best parts. The only good way to play this is with a group of friends. The community is terrible. You can be immediately kicked for having a low level (which adds to the grind) and the host can leave the game if things go badly which ruins the round. The menu is terrible, forcing you to wait for the right heist to show up in the right difficulty. The AI has zero self preservation and will bug out a lot. The singleplayer literally has the other people do NOTHING until everything goes badly and they'll shoot stuff but never really contribute to anything. Again, the gameplay makes up for this but only so far.  Overall this feels incomplete and just a grind that centers around winning instead of fun.

If you keep the four now infamous members of the crew (Dallas, Chains, Hoxton and Wolf), your goal (get the money, ha ha!), and your enemies (except the Blooper) the rest of the game is pretty much different. In both ways.  On the good part, the leveling system is now based on experience instead of money. When leveling up, you unlock guns and skill points, which you can spend in the four skill trees. Weapons are very customizable, as now are masks. You can become pretty much any heister you want. Weapon customization has an impact on your gun as well as your discretion. The detection feature is well done, the alarm can be triggered for more reason that just someone putting his mask somewhere on the map: criminal spotted, gun shot eared, dead body found... Heists can now last several days, each days involving a different place and a different mission. In some cases, an escape event can also be triggered, in which you have to fight the police until your next escape car comes in, which adds some variety and challenge.  On the bad side, several improvements come with a non negligible downside. The most important would be that weapon attachments and mask parts are rewarded at random, during the Payday scene finishing a heist. This means you often need to play many, many heists before putting your hands on the component you are looking for. Concerning heists, they are pretty simple overall: get in, get the money/jowels/diamonds/frames, get out. And survive until the escape comes in. That's quite a difference from the first game. Leveling is also partly interesting, since all guns are unlocked before the level 40. There are 100 levels... Furthermore, high level skills unlocks can make a heist a lot faster, allowing you to leave before serious enemies come in on most jobs, removing quite the challenge. Some equipment also allows you to stay almost undetected, though at the cost of defense and power.  On a personal note, i might add that those unlocks and equipment can be game breaking, in the sense the heists don't get appealing anymore. It has become common, for instance, on stealth heists, to wear the most concealable equipment, and commit suicide if things don't go as planned, which is stupid in my opinion. But that's my opinion.  And that's why i think there are better games to play, including the first Payday.",

Even though I still play this game, I still have a very strong hatred against it. I'd just suggest going back to PAYDAY: The Heist. Or, you know, you can just go to /r/paydayupdate78 and get Update 78 before the safes and drills.  Why do I keep coming back to this game? No idea. I'd compare it to Papyrus' spaghetti, it's bad but you keep coming back for more.  Original review:  PAYDAY 2 is a first person shooter that seems to be different from the latest shooters like Call of Duty or Team Fortress 2 where you run into a building and shoot everybody up and take the intelligence or hold a capture point. In PAYDAY 2, you are put into the shoes of one of the four members in a gang known as the PAYDAY gang. The goal of this game is to go into places such as the Benevolent Bank, a jewelry store, or just a regular bank, and get whatever they have, like cocaine or smuggled money.  This game takes place after PAYDAY: The Heist, which is also a great game. Let's start comparing a few aspects in PAYDAY 2 that weren't in PAYDAY: The Heist or were revised for PAYDAY 2.  First, this game has a better EXP system. Instead of getting cash or money items to level up, you actually have to complete missions to get experience. Oh, and the money? In PAYDAY: The Heist, the game automatically unlocks you the weapons you need once you get to a high enough point in the skill trees. In PAYDAY 2, you have to buy the weapons you want for missions, such as a rocket launcher, or a bow and arrow. The money can also be spent on skill trees, such as the 'Ghost' skilltree, which relies on stealth and dodging bullets, or the 'Enforcer' skilltree, which relies mainly on shotguns and run-and-gun combat. The money can ALSO be spent on mods for your weapons, such as a silencer for stealth missions, or amplifiers that modify your gun's damage and threat. Once you get to level 100 and get enough money into your 'offshore bank account' you can become infamous, which gives you benefits such as putting a spades symbol when you speak in chat.  Next, PAYDAY: The Heist's missions are all unique from each other and you can pick them with ease, without trying to hassle the player into buying them in any way, shape, or form. In PAYDAY 2, you need to wait for all of the missions to appear on the map screen and select the one you think will suit your needs. If you don't want to wait, you can use a contract broker to buy contracts. All of the missions in PAYDAY 2 are all unique from each other and they are constantly updating the game to fix bugs and also add new missions, such as the 'Alesso Heist' where you go into an arena run by a security company named GENSEC and you have to break into their investment safes, whilst using Alesso's concert as cover.  Finally, PAYDAY: The Heist has two missions where you can stealth, one named the Diamond Heist where you go into a skyscraper and steal precious diamonds, and Undercover, where you go into a criminal's house and steal fake money plates. In PAYDAY 2, they have a mix of loud missions and stealth missions, which is what I'd love to see in games like this, where you can pick what you do in the mission.  Moving on, let's get on with the bad things with this game.  First, this game can be riddled with bugs, such as the narrator/radio guy (also known as Bain) can constantly say the same things over and over and over again, the AI can get tased and get stuck being tased, the enemy known as a 'Cloaker' can 1-hit KO you through walls, if you get handcuffed with a magnum, the handcuffs will still be on your hands even after being freed, jumping on the helicopter while it goes into the air will send you going into the air, and a lot of more anomalies.  Sometimes, farming missions isn't going to cut it with experience. Although it's better than putting in forced microtransactions, sometimes doing the most experience-wealthy mission(s) like 'Hoxton Breakout' or 'Cook Off', sometimes it can give you as low as 2 or 3 levels. This only really matters when you have levels up to 80+ or 90.  There is too much DLC. Although OVERKILL is trying to get money for their newer games, atleast tone it down with the DLC.  Overall, this game is great and I'd recommend it to you if you have money to waste.   TL;DR: A game about robbing banks with a 4-man crew. Overall a great game, but has a few flaws that can be fixed.",

It is extremely difficult for new players even on Normal difficulty. It took quite a lot of time to understand how each of the mechanics worked in that game. Once you get the hang of it, it would be a fantastic game.  To start of, PAYDAY: The Heist is already as polished as it gets back in 2011. Now, in 2013, we get PAYDAY 2.  Back when PAYDAY 2 first started, it felt right. A well-done successor to what The Heist did and has introduced a lot of interesting stuff to the game. When I first heard that the Overkill difficulty had enemies where they only take damage to the head and the back frightened me. 'How is it possible!?'.  Now, after 2 and a half years of support from Overkill Software, constantly updating and introducing more stuff into PAYDAY 2, the game became long lasting. Every now and then, I would just come back to play, experiment with new things, finding new ways to play especially with the Update 100 Skill Tree system. I found myself doing the 'New Day, New Build' for about 2 weeks straight. Kept finding new unique ways to play.  I can finally make a build that revolves mainly around the Minigun :D BBBBBBBUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  Anyways, I will continue to support PAYDAY 2 as much as I can.

PAYDAY 2 has you take part in various heists performed by the titular PAYDAY gang. Those can involve anything from something as simple as shooting up an armored truck convoy to steal the goodies to breaking into an art gallery to sell paintings to a corrupt senator, in which you install cameras to monitor his apartament to which you'll be breaking into.  Majority of missions allow you to either approach them stealthily (Taking down security measures, controling the crowd in whatever place you are currently in and making as little noise as possible) or go in guns blazing, fending off waves of increasingly badass cops as you try to complete the heist. The soundtrack is simple, loud, pumping and aggresive techno beats (Worthy of a soundtrack digital download)during combat and subdued simple beats during quiet moments. The graphics are farm from great, but bright color palette and excellent art direction make for a very good experience.  Guns handle very well and the sound effects are immensely satisfying.  There's also a quasi RPG system with four classes, various weapons and upgrades, customisable masks (which are the staple of the gang), and overall feel invoking movies like The Heat...

(if q is switch weapon, and you want it to be melee for example, usually you dont have to reconfigure switch weapon before setting q to melee, but here you do, fortunately you only have to set this up once)  i dont mind buying an expansion pack, new levels and new content, (good examples would be the new tracks and cars in assetto corsa) The weapon packs certainly are just bad marketing that i would expect on a mobile game or some other pay to win. i get that with the hotline miami pack it is licensing to that developer, but it is the kind of thing that steam workshop has tought us to expect for free (as a fan contribution).

They're not the greedy mofos that EA is. Thirdly, constant updates. The game is constantly updated with new content whether it be a new Weapon pack DLC or a free content update for everyone. You wont be waiting for half a year for an update. Fourth and finally, its a very very solid game. The mechanics are great, the levels are fairly large and non linear, the difficulty curve is satsfiying as you go up each difficulty, lots of things to unlock (Espeically if you buy the Courier DLC), and overall the game is totally worth your $30.  If you have $30 to spend, give it to these wonderful people at Starbreeze and Overkill cause they totally deserve every piece of that $30. I've been playing non stop for a month now and havent regretted it. You wont either. :)",

PAYDAY 2 was at one point a great game, but it peaked a long time ago. I'm not sure there's any coming back.  For those of you who haven't followed any of the PAYDAY 2 drama, here's why a lot of the community gave up on the game:     Over-reliance on DLC content to support development of the game, many of which are shameless cross-promotional tie-ins that don't even make sense within the established universe of the game world they're building (John Wick and Point Break are believable tie-ins. Goat Simulator and Hardcore Henry are absolutely NOT).    The insertion of micro-transactions. This angered many players, especially when you consider that the developers themselves specifically said they wouldn't include this kind of system in their game because of the effect it's had on other games. When said system was implemented in 2015, it was presented as a 'reward' to the community for their efforts to help build the player base. The fanbase was instantly divided amongst the hardcore followers of the development team and the players who loved the game the way it was, In 2016, the rights to the PAYDAY franchise returned to Overkill Software, and the decision to include micro-transactions was reversed, or at least altered so that players could get the items in these packages for free, following an apology from Almir himself. However, the reputation of the game and its dev team was already tarnished, and the community never had the same, close-knit relationship between the people playing the game and the people making the game.    The game is lacking in many ways, including basic features. The game's own developers encourage players to download mods to enhance their heads-up displays in ways that the base game should have provided from the beginning. Even some simple animations were missing up until recently, like the animation for jumping.   While I've enjoyed the game for a very long time (over 500 hours at the time of this writing), I just can't muster the will to care any more about the game or the new things coming from it. Play it with friends if it's heavily discounted, but don't hope for greatness.  Also, it's worth noting that console players that were promised updates for their versions of the game got shafted, with the devs flat-out ignoring that audience and in some cases, actually telling them to 'buy the PC version'.",

DLC Quest was moking DLC, limiting you to walk to one direction without buying a movment pack DLC, well looks like DLC Quest's predictions are somewhat true. To unlock grenades you need to bow to the overlords at Overkill and build a shrine dedicted to them and pray to them each night, and grenades are mandatory for some missions where the AI's pacing is utter crap. In GO bank, most civilians spawn behind a shrub where you can't walk to, they can spot you and call the cops, you could throw a greande at them, but if you are a pleb then to bad for you.  The gameplay is alright, stealth is good enough, the thousands of SWAT you will slaughter feel meet-y, But there isn't enough content for this game, there are around 26 DLC's at the time of writing, and I don't imagine they are going to stop at that.

Despite that I stuck with it for about 100 hours before giving up. I have since come back to the game and really got into it again, a lot of bugs have been ironed out, new heists added, the game feels less grind-y because of an exp boost. What I'm trying to say is, this game has come a long way from the start and feels a lot more like a finished product. I wish it was like it is now on release.  I really love this game, it has been the last release I have got hyped about for a while (ignoring the Survivor 2299 disappointment).

The levels are mostly horde mode defense maps with stealth options at higher levels.   Pros: Payday shines brightest when you have a well coordinated team of high level characters with complimentary builds, the stealth is tense, as you sneak between guards and cameras trying not to set off alarms. When things go loud, the shoot outs are exhilerating, the music pumps hard as waves of tougher and tougher special enemies appear from every direction, kicking in doors and jumping through windows to get to your crew.  Cons: It can be really hard to get started as a new player. The stealth requires higher level skills and randomly dropped mods to be feasible, and even then there is never a peaceful option, and no stealth rewards, The skills are very interesting, but half of them are useless, and others are very over powered. The biggest downside is the limited number of complex maps, particularly at endgame, which makes it kind of grindy if you want to max out everything and get all the best stuff.   Summary: If you like co-op shooters with stealth and rpg elements, then this is a really fun game. it has a few rough edges in places, but it looks and plays like an AAA game, which is an amazing achievement for such a small indie company. It certainly kept me captivated for a long time, and I'll definately be checking out any expansions down the line. My one suggestion is to bring friends and play together.",

            "review_text": "PAYDAY 2 was one of the games that I've been wanting to get the most in 2013.  Similar to its prequel, PAYDAY 2 is a first-person shooter heist game where you rob banks, jewelry stores and other places with bots, your friends or complete strangers.   Firstly, there are many ways to do heists. You can either go stealthy, avoid alarms and avoid fighting cops. Or you can go loud and clear with everything you got if you trust your and your fellow teammates' skills. There are overall four different special skill trees that you can pick and upgrade as you play: the Mastermind, the Enforcer, the Ghost and the Technician. Upgrading different skill trees will grant you different abilities and items that can be useful for the heists. Teamwork is essential in this game as it determines how the heist progresses. I suggest to play this game more with friends than strangers for a better teamwork and experience. After getting your money that you got from a heist, you can spend it on weapons, mods and even masks.  However, I wouldn't say this game is always fun. One of the most notable issue of this game is that there aren't many heists so the game is kind of repetitive and feels it's lacking more heists. Although, the creators of PAYDAY 2 sometimes add new heists to the game, however, it pops up yet another issue. One of the annoying issues people have is almost constant updates. This game is already over 29GB and often updates, which annoys some players that aren't used to big updates.  Overall, I still suggest people to buy and play this game if they like teamwork and first-person shooter games.  + Cooperative + Challenging + Customizable  - Repetitive  8.6/10",

Totally stupid and worthless.  Oh, and you need an ARSELOAD of hdd/sdd space to install the game as it's buggy as hell whenever it installs/updates.  If I could find a way to go back several patches and still play the game, it would be fun. Oh wait, I think pirated versions allow that (because dumb patches/DLC content is not forced upon pirated versions).

The diversity of jobs in Payday 2 is laughable, all jobs end with you going here and bagging said objective and leaving, where payday had you accomplishing feats of big time heists of movies and such, not knocking off the minimart for 4k.  The most tiring thing in the game is its grind and lack of weapon attachments the easily could have been implemented in a shop type system like is guns -w- , and bringing back paydays in game achievements of kill x amount cops with x that netted you a cash/ exp bonus for completion would easily made the grind go a bit faster.

Of course, none of those stupid bots could carry a bag or restart the drill. It was so hard to code. I'm really disappointed by this game. It should have been issued as a multi-player game only. On top of that, it's full of bugs, has an horrible FOV at 45 degrees peripheral and a server that runs as fast as a Pentium 90, making you wait a good 5 minutes before playing a heist.

            "review_text": "(Please note before we start, that this is purely my opinion)   Payday 2 is a great Fast Paced Shooter which evolves around robbing/heisting banks, various stores, thug/mercenary hideouts and more. The game offers great maps, multiplayer, weapons, weapon-attachments, replay value and Masks. Don't forget the Masks!   Maps: The Maps in Payday 2 have great replay value and over-all look great. With each new time you play, certain mission-related objects change around, for example doors, loot and of course enemy A.I. so you don't get the same old crap every time.  Characters: The characters in Payday 2 mainly go by nationality, which is pretty cool in that the game has loads of diversity and add's even more replay value. Accents may be a problem with some people, but that usually ends off ok, hence there are loads of other characters to choose from which can be purchased or sometimes added for free in free content packs. Weapons: There are LOADS of weapons to choose from in Payday 2. Shotguns, Snipers, Pistols, Smg's, Assault rifles.. even a Minigun for mass cop murder! and if that's not enough, you can customize them with different weapon-attachments to change the way you play with that weapon. Again, adding more ways to play.  Masks: Masks are a huge part of Payday 2, mainly cosmetic feature, but they go further than that, it's what keeps you from getting enclosed behind metal bars! You can customize your mask to what suits you most, or well, do whatever the hell you want with it apart from drawing a ♥♥♥♥ on it (They have their boundries of course, haha). To do this, you can choose from ton's of different materials, colours and patterns to change the way your Mask looks, which is really cool. You can also buy Mask slots to increase the capacity of Masks you are aloud to have at once in your inventory, so, the more Masks the better, right?   Downsides: There's only two problems I find about this game, the friendly A.I. and the graphics.  Friendly A.I. The A.I. you get in single player jobs or multiplayer jobs where there are less than four people are dog-♥♥♥♥. To make up for this, they're given a lot more health than usual players, however they are unable to equip any other armour or weaponary. Most of the time they are meh, an get the job done when say you get downed or become your bullet-sponge, but that's it. And quite often, they barely revive you, They might start halfway and just give-up to fight like one enemy or something, Or in the worst-case scenario, they glitch and not come for you at all, ending in a mission failure on single-player.  Graphics: The graphics in this game are debatable, but in my opinion they're outdated a bit. This is more nit-picky though as I don't care about graphics too much, more about gameplay, but they could be better. However the company who made this game is fairly small, so you have to take that into account. Although the graphics have improved dramatically from the last game, it still isn't the best, but very bareable.  Overall rating: Personally, I give this game a 8.5/10, losing some marks for only two reasons which are listed above. I hope this review was atleast somewhat helpful to people who are thinking about wheither buying the game or not. Thanks for reading.",

We people in the third world can not put so many hard disk to computer so we have to delete so much,really so much for u , OVK ,to give the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ update. i mean , come on!WHY DO U occupy more than 20g space!? But there are just less than 100 MByte to download, why are u doing this !?!?!? And every time it have to waste more than ten minutes to take the 20g space then give me back. After the annoying update, i just found that there are some few more masks. Nobody really cares these masks ok? Second, it's about Jiro.We bought yakuza for katana and Japanese character.But Jiro doesn't look like in the video.He even doesn't have hair!And 54 years old?And that stupid voice shouting over and over again!? If he's really a Japanese criminal gang, he would have kid at the age of 18 and 20 years later be out of the prison he's already 38.His kid is already 20.Jiro looks so cool now,Isn't that good? But what i see is an old man.A crazy old people. And Clover looks bad too! Her voice sounds good ,but looks like a normal officer in ur studio.Did u just do it to save money? That's all.thanks",

Stealth is fun and intense (and provides bonuses and additional challenge).  The only thing I could say is wrong is sometimes it's buggy (SWAT walking into the building backwards single-file is pretty hilarious) but not outright gamebreaking. Also do not try to play this offline/singleplayer because the team AI is terrible and there is no way of giving them commands. Also there's a lot of unlockables but behind DLC (I bought almost all of them anyways).  For me the fun of the game definitely outweighs the cons.  ♥♥♥♥ my drill broke, got to go.",

Historical pack (Trench Knife, Mosin Nagant, American Flag) Overkill Pack (Minigun and a Rocket Launcher, what else do you need?)

You have to turn the music and sound effects down to about 10% in order to hear people speaking to you.

Also DLCs, at the first time when it came out, there were lots of weapons and mods in one dlc. like shotgun mod, gage courier, sniper, WWII mods, kinds of stuff. Some people says 'contents doesn't come free', I agree, and I am willing to pay if it is reasonably priced and I bought all of the DLCs until the overkill pack. However now days its just some new masks, new weapon texture in old frame with slightly changed status, 1 or max 2 new weapons include melee and it cost 5 bucks.  Also Overkill updated new infamy system, which made the highest infamy lvl from 5 to 25. I think the company try to motivate old users to go higher levles, which is good. But (as always), from infamy 0 to 5 and 6 to 25 are totally different. From 0 to 5 (infamy 1.0) had hugh motivation, and well planned system,  that makes user to able to build advanced system compare to non-infamied players. which gives some actual advantages on game + new mask. On the other hand infamy 2.0 (6 to 25) gives you advantage of extra experience 10% or extrea exp 7.5% with mask. This sounds like users need to lvl to go higher lvl...? it sounds more like that overkill just gave up on putting effor to plan and manage the balacne between old users and new users. btw skill doesn't always convert bad player to good player.  I really like the game and would prob play couple more months, however I would not recommend new players to purchase this game since its getting worse not better, in contents wise and especially management wise.",

Whether you bought the DLC or not, you and your friends got the choice to play however you wanted to. This really set the title apart from most other fps shooters, it made the game unique and gave was what made me buy the game. The best part about the Payday series was that it was a refresher from all the generic shooter games that are pushed out every year, and didn't try to copy what everyone else was doing.   With the introduction of skins and crates, I've lost all hope for the Payday series. The problem isn't just the skins, and I'm sure had they been released at a different time, I would have loved the update. The problem is how absolute ♥♥♥♥ Overkill has been on implementing new ideas. Overkill ♥♥♥♥ all over the Steam market, so the only way to see the true price for an item, is by having to price check everyone single one. They ♥♥♥♥ all over the customers who bought the masks, shirts, and bobbleheads from the Overkill store. They ♥♥♥♥ on all the fans of the Payday series by releasing half-♥♥♥♥♥ updates every week and pricing them for $27 a piece. And they ♥♥♥♥ on their own game by releasing a crappy update with skins, instead of fixing the problems they already have.    Maybe, if I hadn't had already hated Overkill, I would't mind the skins update. But to me, this update is essentialy a virtual '♥♥♥♥ You' courtesy of the folks over at Overkill. It shows how Overkill thinks shoving crap at our faces will make us forget everything they have done in the past. They believe they can just copy ideas from other games, and sell it to us as something we should be excited about. So, unless you are willing to support this type of shoddy behaviour, and are okay with letting go of all your money just to have Overkill eventually turn this series into a generic shooter, then by all means go ahead and buy the game. As for me, I just wish that I had never supported this crap.",

Makes a reader want to rocket his or her lunch right out of his or her stomach! It could literally make someone who's projectile-vomitting SOUP turn into a lethal hazard!)  Alright. What can I say about this game that is really rad and that I really ♥♥♥♥ing enjoy? Well, quite a lot, actually. I adore the over-the-top gameplay that this game manages to provide while maintaining a believable atmosphere. You've got endless hordes of police officers out to put your ♥♥♥ in custody and a limited supply of ammo, health, and zip-ties (the zip-ties are used primarily to keep your hostages in check.) There are special force units, too, which are constantly making an appearance as you try to find a suitable position for protection during a firefight. You've got your impenetrable riot shield guys, your taser guys who keep you shocked in place, your 'I'm-so-♥♥♥♥in'-huge-you-can't-stop-the-pain-train' guys, and even your classic Tom Clancy 'I'm-Sam-Fischer-and-I-wear-nightvision-24/7-now-let-me-drop-through-a-vent-and-karate-your-♥♥♥-to-prison' guys. Basically, tons of enemies that force you to stay near your comerades and co-operate if you don't want to fail a mission.  There's tons of stuff to unlock and collect, but it basically comes down to a ♥♥♥♥-load of customization for your weapons and masks. At the end of each mission, aside from the giant payout of cash and experience points, you're rewarded with the opportunity to draw 1 of 3 face-down cards. When the card you pick flips over, you might receive a new mask, a weapon mod, some mask-customizing materials, or even another load of cash/exp. It keeps players invested in missions that might otherwise begin to feel tedious, since although there are many maps to choose from, some maps are played more than others.  My first ten hours with this game were a blast. I played a lot of it with a friend, and taking some missions seriously while completely screwing up others kept things interesting. I've invested a little bit over 30 hours now and I'm still enjoying my time with it, but the game does have its flaws. Often you may be spotted at a location you might presume to be safe. Situations (like my personal bane, the 'I'm going to hide on under this staircas- oh nevermind, the guards have x-ray glasses,') arise frequently on certain maps, which lead me to believe that some maps are less fine-tuned than others... Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ the picture frame map - it's a messy waste of time.   It's also easy to become frustrated when your crew of 4 are overwhelmed by the endless waves of enemies who spawn right around every corner around outside buildings. Though it is the gameplay's raison d'etre, it's nice to have a slight moment of peace that allows the players to collect the ammo packs that've dropped from numerously slain enemies. High-leveled players with many unlocked perks usually don't have as great an issue with surviving, but it's common to have moments of awkward frustation when a teammate or oneself is downed and can't be saved due to everybody lacking ammo. And before I forget, y'know those things called melee weapons? Yeah, pretty much useless... Unless you buy DLC for good ones... Which I have done because this game kicks ♥♥♥... but still.    TL;DR: Game is good. Few irksome flaws. Overall I'd say buy it if you have the money, it's a jolly good time with friends... Somewhat-so with randoms.   7.5/10 (HA, a number rating. ♥♥♥♥in' gross and gayyy.)",

The big banks pay you a lot more, earn you more XP, and are generally WAY more fun.

You have to grind endlessly to modify your gear, because mods are random loot, after a successful heist. And half of the weapons are dlc-items anyway, so you would have to pay even more to equip them.   Speaking of a successful heist; it is not fun to play a game on higher difficulties with a pug. A Party consisting of four players/bots has to achieve the mission goals, to fend off myriads of brainless bullet-sponges, but above all has to work together as a team.   Problem is: Bots are just useless as team members, but many random players even try their best to nullify your efforts: They hold on to important mission objects instead of using them, don't proceed to the target zone, are yelling insults or are just plainly afk etc. There is no safeguard in place to keep them at bay, like matchmaking and penalties for destructive behavior, or at least an option to downvote these mischievous kids as a warning for the next unsuspecting player.   If you are happy to play with three friends the only enemies are technical issues, like random disconnects, lags, clipping bugs, or invisible weapons (of course with invisible iron sights). The game pers se is not demanding enough to grind on. I got millions of cash from missions but can't use them, because the mods are rare drops. And if you prefer the stealth approach, you'll will have to pay real money to get the right items or repeat lifeless missions for a very long time, just to get a silencer for your weapons.   If you enjoyed the recent CoD titles, feel free to sink your real money in this game, to earn tons of virtual money. Imho it feels more like a f2p-game with the constant grinding, technical issues and bad support.  ",

I won't talk about the skins, i don't need to share my opinion about it, forum is made for that. The soundtrack, one of the best i've listened, and probably the best of all the co-op i've played. Very Immersive. Voice acting is also nice. There tons and tons of references to movies, series and video games.

This is absurd, it's like they charge you on every breath they take. The game itself isn't updated anymore, it goes through updates to advertise to you to buy the DLCs, and the DLCs are the ones that get bugfixes.

            "review_text": "Alright. What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? (HA, what a cliche intro! Makes a reader want to rocket his or her lunch right out of his or her stomach! It could literally make someone who's projectile-vomitting SOUP turn into a lethal hazard!)  Alright. What can I say about this game that is really rad and that I really ♥♥♥♥ing enjoy? Well, quite a lot, actually. I adore the over-the-top gameplay that this game manages to provide while maintaining a believable atmosphere. You've got endless hordes of police officers out to put your ♥♥♥ in custody and a limited supply of ammo, health, and zip-ties (the zip-ties are used primarily to keep your hostages in check.) There are special force units, too, which are constantly making an appearance as you try to find a suitable position for protection during a firefight. You've got your impenetrable riot shield guys, your taser guys who keep you shocked in place, your 'I'm-so-♥♥♥♥in'-huge-you-can't-stop-the-pain-train' guys, and even your classic Tom Clancy 'I'm-Sam-Fischer-and-I-wear-nightvision-24/7-now-let-me-drop-through-a-vent-and-karate-your-♥♥♥-to-prison' guys. Basically, tons of enemies that force you to stay near your comerades and co-operate if you don't want to fail a mission.  There's tons of stuff to unlock and collect, but it basically comes down to a ♥♥♥♥-load of customization for your weapons and masks. At the end of each mission, aside from the giant payout of cash and experience points, you're rewarded with the opportunity to draw 1 of 3 face-down cards. When the card you pick flips over, you might receive a new mask, a weapon mod, some mask-customizing materials, or even another load of cash/exp. It keeps players invested in missions that might otherwise begin to feel tedious, since although there are many maps to choose from, some maps are played more than others.  My first ten hours with this game were a blast. I played a lot of it with a friend, and taking some missions seriously while completely screwing up others kept things interesting. I've invested a little bit over 30 hours now and I'm still enjoying my time with it, but the game does have its flaws. Often you may be spotted at a location you might presume to be safe. Situations (like my personal bane, the 'I'm going to hide on under this staircas- oh nevermind, the guards have x-ray glasses,') arise frequently on certain maps, which lead me to believe that some maps are less fine-tuned than others... Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ the picture frame map - it's a messy waste of time.   It's also easy to become frustrated when your crew of 4 are overwhelmed by the endless waves of enemies who spawn right around every corner around outside buildings. Though it is the gameplay's raison d'etre, it's nice to have a slight moment of peace that allows the players to collect the ammo packs that've dropped from numerously slain enemies. High-leveled players with many unlocked perks usually don't have as great an issue with surviving, but it's common to have moments of awkward frustation when a teammate or oneself is downed and can't be saved due to everybody lacking ammo. And before I forget, y'know those things called melee weapons? Yeah, pretty much useless... Unless you buy DLC for good ones... Which I have done because this game kicks ♥♥♥... but still.    TL;DR: Game is good. Few irksome flaws. Overall I'd say buy it if you have the money, it's a jolly good time with friends... Somewhat-so with randoms.   7.5/10 (HA, a number rating. ♥♥♥♥in' gross and gayyy.)",

Furthermore, Overkill has the cheek to even release this new big change to their business practice right on their anniversary. This shows how insensitive they are to us, the consumers and gamers of Payday. As to date, 'Pay2Day' DLCs and current heists are still suppar compared to the original game.   For those out there who still have not brought this game or DLC out there, this Crimefest will be the last for me and for the many 'old' 'Pay2Day' gamers out there if they still do not understand what the general community wants.

Its terrible in both aspects. This game probably has the most unused potential of all games in Steam. There are many realy good ideas, but all of them are destroyed by big design flaws. Every gameplay problem you can imagine, payday 2 has it.  Ofcourse the idea behind this system is great: You are a gangster and can decide how you want to act, like the bad guys from Die Hard or like the good guys from Oceans eleven. But it just doesn't work.  A list of problems: Invisible walls everywhere.  Enemys spawn out of nowhere.  Balancing of skills is terrible, is is hard to learn but easy to master cops behave like those enemys from serious sam with bombs instead of heads. Stealth isn't realy usefull, not too hard, but too....wrong. npcs bug thrugh walls, hear and see you sometimes when you are behind them, but don't see you when you are in front of them. If you are good in stealth gaming, and can kill every cop without then noticing the game spawns additional units...why then even bother giving me the opportunity to kill them stealth in the firct place? The cops pay no attention to civilians or hostages or there own life. The civilian themself don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their own life. It just feels bad, everything. The shooting and the sneaking.  If you are interested in stealth games, stick to Thief, Splinter cell, or the commandos series. If you are interested in shooters buy wolfenstein. This game isn't good in one or the other, and the mix is even worse.  The small amount of content in the game (missions, weapons and mods) is stretched buy high prices and small quest rewards.If you buy a scope you can use it once. You can not take it away from your gun an attach it to a other gun, you have to buy it again. Thats not bad? well, you can't just buy it again, you have to unlock it first...again. if you take it away from an old gun you have to unlock it again.  You need to unlock and buy every mod for every gun individual, and you can't choose what to unlock, after each succesfull mission you unlock one random thing, a weapon, a mod, a color, a skin, a material. If you are only interested in the first two...well too bad.",

Some things have been addressed. Most STILL HAVE NOT.  if you're okay:  with an absurdly complex game of grind to get the optimum addons and weapons to be pulling your weight AND having fun.   The fact that you have to host your own games, and play only with friends to avoid the extremely toxic playerbase...  Compete against suicidal, neverending waves of autoaim cops, if you're exited by the loud mode. Compete against suicidal hostages, bodybag limit, weird AI ruling the security HQ taking the calls outside the map..  and sometimes repetitive nature of some objectives in both modes...   While being rewarded: -RNG'd parts mixed within a sea of utterly useless cosmetic junk -remains of the walletsafe (a genius way to rob players thought by overkill, now defunct) -cash that makes NO use aside adding more grind and unlocking the cosmetic junk  then you might enjoy this.  in 160 hours i unlocked about 50% of the weapon mods and 25-30% of the cosmetics. Most DLC's add mods that are locked unless you play specific loadouts as a team, making the players who have not bought those weights for their teams.",

The Gunplay is a little bit better than 'Payday The Heist' although the guns can easily be fired from the hip. Some weapons have some decent recoil while others feel like you are firing a airsoft rifle.  I rate Gunplay a 6/10     Next I will review A.I. (Teammates, cops, etc)  Your teammates are really stupid, they will hit their targets (sometimes) and they won't help carry bags, fix the drill, or tie hostages. Alothough if you have a team of 3 the only A.I. is a great healer.  Next up, Cops. The cops are all pretty dumb but they have some quite entertaining ragdoll physics.  And last and least, Hostages. They are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I give the A.I a total of 4/10 Teammates 5/10, Cops 5/10, and Hostages 2/10    Third I will talk about Co-op vs solo.   As I said before the A.I. is pretty stupid but this game can be played solo no problem. However, The Co-op is one of the best parts in the game (if you are with friends). No a lot of games can give you the: Panic, excitment, strategy, teamwork, and timing that this game can. the Co-op is the best part about this game hands down.  Co-op 10/10, Solo 7/10 (solo is manly for just needing extra cash fast or not connected to the internet).      And last but not least, Enjoyment.  The enjoyment is all up to the people you play with. I play with randoms a lot and I still have a blast although sometimes you can come across the people who kick you for 'screwing up' or 'bringing the wrong gun'. If you are with friends, this game (and left for dead 2) is a great game to play with them.  I rate enjoyment: with friends 10/10, without friends 3/10 to a 9/10.    All together I give the game a 8/10.  I highly recommend this game if you are getting bored of something like Left for dead 2 or something like that and at this price (at the time of the review the game was $7.49) what do you have to loose. at 30 bucks I would wait for it to go on sale to about 20 or below.

            "review_text": "This game is a one of the best co-op games ever made. I played the first payday and this one is definitely an improvement in all forms. This game will satisfy your fantasy of robbing banks and whatnot, and it is highly influenced by famous heist movies like 'Heat' and 'The Town'. You want to go gunblazin' with no plan -Check, you want to plan your heist and use stealth -Check.   This game is a 4-player co-op game, so you are going to need a good group of friends with voice chat for the best experience, although the matchmaking in this game is not so bad. The heists are variable and range from banks to gang hideouts to armored trucks and a lot others.   There is a skill tree system, having 4 trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Technician, Ghost, and a new one Fugitive. These are important as it gives each player a set of skills that can be used in every heist depending on the situation. You can mix skills from different trees or you can ace one tree completely, but you can only do either as your skill points are limited. A crew with each member acing one different skill tree makes the perfect team.  On the downside, the heists can get repeititve but only after a longtime, the graphics are average at best if it matters to you. and the enemy AI is not 'particularly' smart.  All in all, if you are looking for a good co-op game with continuous updates and an awesome developer 'Overkill', this is the game for you.",

        {
            "review_text": "Payday 2. Game of many titles: DLC Simulator, Winner of Worst AI Competition, maybe even Sell-out. Either way, let's review it.  ------------------PROS------------------  -Heists. Yes, the missions. Diverse and many, this game gives you a little bit of everything you want. From the most simplest of heists, the basic robbery of small stores, to the most overly complicated heists of all time, massive bank with huge vault that takes 15 minutes to open, even a 'heist' where you cook meth with instructions from google. Everything rolled into this game. Even some stealth missions to tingle those Oceans 11 nuts you've got stored away in those forget-me pants.  -Guns. So many gosh darn guns. Assault rifles, LMG's, SMG's, Shotguns, pistols, and every miscellaneous gun you could find in between, all wrapped up complete with loads of custom modifications for them.  -Stealth. Yes, it's flawed. Yes, it's difficult. Yes, you might have to answer a pager just to say you ordered a pizza. But it works, and it's (usually) fun. If you really have trouble, play Shadow Raid by yourself until you get the hang of it. That's what I did.  -Environment. Control hostages, board up windows, drill through safes, blow open walls, you name it, this game has a heist where you can interact with it. On that note...  -Objectives. These are usually well placed. Money looks very appetizing, and stuffing it into bags is great fun. When you have to leave behind even one dufflebag, it hurts. Drilling into vaults is also great, but... well check the realism con later on.  -Visuals. The game looks sharp with good looking masks, escape vehicles are made to look like godsends near the end of a long and treacherous heist, and all interactables usually look natural.  -Content. Ignoring price tags, this game has LOADS of content. DLC's provide extra weapons, masks, characters, heists, and such. Any DLC mission is also available to those without the DLC, but join someone who does, making it easy to play all the heists. Even base game, it has alot of content.  -Multiplayer. Well executed to say the very least. Easy to use drop-in system allows you to find the heist you want easily, even if it's already mid-level. Servers are good, and the community isn't too cancerous.  ------------------GRAY------------------  -DLC's. If you get them all on sale, they can give you alot of fun. However, there's just too many DLC's too purchase every new one as it comes out. It would be easy to fix too: just group small DLC's into larger expansions. Group all the Gage packs, then character packs, then heist packs. That way, DLC's would need to be individually purchased. Or better yet, make less paid DLC all together, and people won't be scared to buy the game.  Characters. Yes, yes, story isn't what Payday is about. But, if you incorporate characters, you have to make them have either good storys, or no backstory at all. I'd be fine just rolling into a bank heist knowing nothing about the character, just make your character packs all visuals. Just please, for the love of Gaben, don't try to make Hoxton have a backstory, or have Bain blabber on and on about pointless garbage mid-heist. First off, Bain annoys the living crap out of me, second his ineptitude for giving commands or giving advice is a real thorn in my scrote. Third, he acts like a whimp if you get caught. 'Aw! I must've miscalculated something guys! Please forgive me!'. It's okay, jack-♥♥♥. It's not your fault, it's the heisters' faults. On the good side, their characters all look the way they should. Heisters look hardened, you bosses look like they are well put together. I personally love the Dentist and the Elephant, they look like professionals. Voice acting is...well you can put together your own opinions from watching gameplay or something.  ------------------CONS------------------  -AI. The AI is so freakin' bad. The default team-AI's won't fix the drill, pickup bags, or bring heavier armor. They tend to get stuck pretty often aswell. The enemy AI is pretty abysmal as well, walking in to moltov'ed areas, meat-grinder tactics, and even waiting at power boxes long after they pulled the switch. You can usually deal with all of this, though.  -Developers. For a while they were absolutley fantastic. They put out solid community stuff, dealt with any bugs people had, even made a cheater's tag for those who decided they didn't want to wait for the good stuff. Didn't ban for cheating either, which in my opinion was a solid move. But lately, they've been falling short. It seems like they let their success get to their heads. Come'on guys, micro-transactions? With this many DLC's? Just read the articles.  -Fixing ♥♥♥♥. 'Drill's broken.''Drill's broken.''Drill's broken.''Drill's broken.''Drill's broken.' Over and over, fix the drill, turn on the power, answer the pagers. All of it is just too often. The drill should jam once, maybe twice. The power switch situation? Put a bigger cool-down on the cops ability to turn off the power. It gets really damn annoying.  -Realism. Call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure swat teams don't just shoot the living ♥♥♥♥ out of a bank full of hostages. The police will constantly send wave upon wave of SWAT teams to kill you, even when you're clearly killing all of them. I played the big bank heist and single-handedly killed 411 police officers and 10 civilians with a ♥♥♥♥ing flamethrower. 411. The approximate size of DC's police force is 3,900 cops. That means I, one man with a ♥♥♥♥ing flamethrower, killed nearly a tenth of all the cops in America's capitol. AND THEY KEPT THROWING MORE AT ME. Which moron thought it was a good idea to just send them in, one after another, into a giant flame-filled corridor? Why not just surround it and ask for our demands? We have hostages, we could say we would kill some if they came into the bank. But do we? No, because roasting them all with a mother ♥♥♥♥ing flamethrower is much more effective. Look, I know Payday 2 is an over-the-top action filled shooter about being a four man army that robs banks past the point of even needing the money, but come on. Why can't we just keep them at bay with threats of harm towards civies? Maybe we could execute one if they try to sneak in or try to snipe us? Eh, whatever. What's done is done.  Price. Dude, just lower your DLCs' prices already.  ------------------TLDR------------------ Overall, the game has alot of flaws. But so does everything. It's a solid game with good shooty-bangs and nice action-packed heists just like in the movies. I give it a breezy 8 out of 10.",

It is possible to play this game without friends, comunication and cooperation, but it is unlikely that you will be successful on the harder difficulties. It is also possible to play and complete allmost all of the missions solo as long as you 'Stealth' the level.  But either way, this game is easy to pick up and play, but hard to master, you can play it casually for fun, or really put in the time and the effort to take the big rewards.  Try not to rely on the 'Friendly' 'AI' too much, they are more meat shields than usefull allies, they do little dammage and on times don't seem to even realise that they are currently in a mini war.  Rating - I personally Love this game and have since I first played it.  - It could do with a bit of a re-balance, mainly the shotguns.  - It would be nice to see longer missions.  - Love the level design, every mission and every difficulty has its own challenges.  - Can't just camp and win every map.  - You have to try and think ahead as much as you can.   ::||:: Would happily buy it again. Easily in the Top 10 games on Steam (Personal oppinion) ::||::",

So you get No xp or money. Those people are pretty rare now days but it still happens. The controls are pretty simple and clean. The game play is fun and addictive. Most missions have 2 options... stealth or kill everything that moves. Both are pretty fun. The longer you play the more tricks other in the community will teach you. You will find many people willing to help you level up. The community is a great group of gamers. I would recommend giving this game a shot. My only complaint is that a duffle bag of 100 $ bills should be worth more than a few thousand. Also a Duffle bag full of gold should be worth more than a few thousand.",

The DLC in the game for the most part is fantastic it gives you many ways to play the game for example.The Gage Ninja Pack is amazing for stealth and going loud. The pistol crossbow is great for going loud because of the upgrades you can get with it and the smg is devistating (with the right upgrades). 3. The game has many heists even if you don't have any DLC and has a ton of replay ability. 4. The side jobs are fun and a easy way to get some cash but they are easily forgetable meaning you will some times do them but they are still good for the most part. 5.The custimization is fantastic you can unlock a mask and really make it your own with the many many patterns and matterials. -The Cons  1. The game is EXTREMELY buggy with body's flying in the air and a weird mouse glich it has made me restart the game countless times. 2. The DLC aswell,i know i said this was a possitive some are very bad like the Gage Chivalry Pack and The Big Bank Heist    Thats all i really have to say about this game it's fun but can be annoying so i will give it a 8/10",

They took OUT the microtransaction system after buying the rights to the game from 505. I tip my mask to them for showing that they HAVE been trying to work in the interests of the community. (OVERKILL, we salute you)  CONS: - Iffy community (sometimes it's plain toxic and other times it's great UPDATE: It's getting better now that the black market's dead) - Not 100% bug free (but it's fine most of the time) - Not for impatient people (lots of moving bags or waiting on drills) - Lower level players DO tend to get kicked out of higher difficulty heists, but you can always host your own if you have trouble getting into lobbies  NOTES (I don't consider these pros or cons but they're worth considering): - Buyable Skins (They CAN have MINOR stat boosts but imho they don't really affect gameplay, they're just there to look cool and spice things up) - UPDATE ON SKINS: You don't have to pay to open safes now, but can still get the old skins this way. New skin safes are free to open) - Paid DLC and lots of it (You don't NEED these to enjoy the game, but a majority of the content is DLC. They aren't super expensive and you can pick and choose the content that you want) - I have bought ALL of the DLC just to support the developers and because, while some of the stuff is ridiculous and almost useless (Chivalry Pack), all of the DLC's add new, fun ways to play the game and keep it interesting. (If you're considering buying all the DLC, start with getting the GOTY version during a sale or something. Similar price to the base game but includes roughly $40-50 worth of DLC.  TL;DR - Good game.

With a good team, you will destroy everything and take your prize!  Speaking of prizes. That's the goal of the game. Heist and claim it all. Get used to playing some of the harder heists because those will net you the huge payouts and large XP bonuses. Some of my favorite things to do in this game are going in with my largest weapons and taking out everything in front of me. With weapons like the LMGs and DLC sniper rifles, it's endless fun.  With Multiplayer, There will deffinately be people who will troll you and all that but I myself haven't had that problem in a public game. Probably because I am very patient when someone messes up a heist and I get lucky when I meet players. Personally, I like it when a team messes up because then we can discuss new strategies and just have a good time. It's also a damn good feeling to get a team and stealth into anything without flaw. Either way, you're gonna have a good time with this.  I'd recommend this game for anyone wanting a game that makes them feel oh so good.

We have the classic bank heists, jewlery shop heists and all that, and then we have the really different ones: there's one where you try to steal a samurai armour from a giant warehouse, one where you try to steal a nuclear bomb from a train or from a shipping boat, a few that have to do with drugs and cartels, and a few other ones that aren't just your classic bank heist. Each mission can be completed the hard way, fighting agaisnt waves of cops, or the easy (not really all that easy sometimes) way where you do it in a stealthy manner. There's lots of different weapons and many attachements for each giving you lots of customization in how you want a certain weapon to be focused on or on how it will be played, a skill tree where you can focus on being a tank, a medic, a stealthy based guy, a low armour but high dodge chance character or a tactitian. Each way you choose your skills will highly change the way you have to play to get the most out of those skills. There's difficulties for every type of player. Normal, for the casual player, Hard, for the one that wants a little bit, but not much, of a challenge. Very Hard, for the player that wants a slighty harder mission with stronger and different types of enemies, Overkill, for the player who wants a real challenge. Finally, Death Wish for the people who want to try the mission over and over again... You can eitheir play with pre-made lobbies or just play in a public match. If you don't have a certain DLC but want to play a mission from that DLC then you can just ask a friend to host that mission (they'll need the DLC of course) or join a public match of someone hosting that mission, which means you technically don't need to buy any DLC to play every mission in the game. Cheaters aren't much of a problem since for the most part the game is cheater free, although if you do have a cheater in your lobby you and the other players can just kick him. Cheaters usually just fool around but don't kill you or troll you. Now for the scoring part: Gameplay 9.5/10 , a 10/10 in this category is very hard since gameplay can be very subjective, for the most part the game is fine, there's the occasional glitch every now and then but for the most part it's fine. Missions are enjoyable and have their touch of enjoyment. Graphics 7/10 , the graphics are fine for a 15£ game it's but aren't anything revolutionary. They're fine as long as you're not a person that only enjoys photorealistic games. Lore/Stroryline 6.5/10 , it is a shooter but it does have its touch of lore. The characters have stories behind them, missions are usually tied to some kind of cartel or source, every mission is obtained by one of  Crime.net's  members and it's quite nice to know how a certain member from the gang has come about to join it.  The game is very fun to play with friends and will keep you bunch entertained for hours and hours.",

            "review_text": "Okay I will split this review up into 4 parts: 1. Gunplay, 2. A.I, 3. Co-op vs solo, and 4. Enjoyment.   To start things off lets talk about Gunplay.  The Gunplay is a little bit better than 'Payday The Heist' although the guns can easily be fired from the hip. Some weapons have some decent recoil while others feel like you are firing a airsoft rifle.  I rate Gunplay a 6/10     Next I will review A.I. (Teammates, cops, etc)  Your teammates are really stupid, they will hit their targets (sometimes) and they won't help carry bags, fix the drill, or tie hostages. Alothough if you have a team of 3 the only A.I. is a great healer.  Next up, Cops. The cops are all pretty dumb but they have some quite entertaining ragdoll physics.  And last and least, Hostages. They are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I give the A.I a total of 4/10 Teammates 5/10, Cops 5/10, and Hostages 2/10    Third I will talk about Co-op vs solo.   As I said before the A.I. is pretty stupid but this game can be played solo no problem. However, The Co-op is one of the best parts in the game (if you are with friends). No a lot of games can give you the: Panic, excitment, strategy, teamwork, and timing that this game can. the Co-op is the best part about this game hands down.  Co-op 10/10, Solo 7/10 (solo is manly for just needing extra cash fast or not connected to the internet).      And last but not least, Enjoyment.  The enjoyment is all up to the people you play with. I play with randoms a lot and I still have a blast although sometimes you can come across the people who kick you for 'screwing up' or 'bringing the wrong gun'. If you are with friends, this game (and left for dead 2) is a great game to play with them.  I rate enjoyment: with friends 10/10, without friends 3/10 to a 9/10.    All together I give the game a 8/10.  I highly recommend this game if you are getting bored of something like Left for dead 2 or something like that and at this price (at the time of the review the game was $7.49) what do you have to loose. at 30 bucks I would wait for it to go on sale to about 20 or below.

I liked the way you guys had created the entire layout...yeah there were still some issues that needed fixed and some you fixed while others still are around.   BUT, then you went with this DEATH WISH UPDATE. YOU TURNED THE STEALTH SYSTEM INTO A CONDOM - ♥♥♥♥ING WITH IT BEFORE THROWING IT OUT. THEN YOU PUT THIS NEW ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T STEALTH SYSTEM IN THE GAME. YOU MADE IT TO WHERE PEOPLE ARE MORE INCLINED TO JUST ASSAULT THE SITE RATHER THAN EVEN TRY TO STEALTH IT. SO FAR, I'VE SEEN NOTHING THAT HAS BENEFITTED STEALTHING MISSIONS BESIDES THIS XP BOOST AT THE END (ASSUMING IT'S EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE TO STEALTH IT WITHOUT WASTING COUNTLESS HOURS TRYING TO WORK WITH THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T SYSTEM).   It was dumb of me to give this game a second chance after the Death Wish update. I'm done...I'm uninstalling the game and am leaving the group as I write this. HELL, if I could...I'd demand a refund from this piece of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that WAS PayDay2. You could have just left the system the way it was...and it would have been fine. More new heists and maps might have made the update better, but instead...you went and changed the game into something that seems to be just shoot everything and steal.

Last DLCs and update were literally ♥♥♥♥ (e.g. Chivalry Pack, clearly another collaboration made quickly and grossly, with unbalanced weapon and so), last Crimefest was disappointing (MASKS, MASKS, MASKS), OVERKILL simply started to give way too much importance to the money they earned and less importance to community feedbacks, destroying the incredible relationship that they created during the first years of the game (yes, Almir, I'm talking about you and your pool of devs, you made this mess).  Weapon balance was sure needed (AKs and CAR became the only real viable weapon on DW, LMGs became way too much weak, pistols weren't viable for anything at all and became decent only having the right skills and so on), but nerfing everything and introducing skins that improved weapon's stats at the same time it's just unfair and makes no sense, unless you follow the greedy logic they took some time ago and that's gonna destroy everything they created so far. And I'm sad and upset for that.  Also: did you learn something from TF2's history? Do you know when that game started to die? Yes, when they introduced Mannconomy, and I know you aren't fool enough not to think about it. Then: are you planning to spoil definitely this game to show PD3 off soon? You choose the wrong way and I personally won't buy anything more from you.  So long and thank you for ruining everything and cheating an entire community.

Also the new skills are also very fun to play.Now l'll recommend it l'm looking forward for Payday 2 future   A perfect game it has everything.You can stealth your way or get in with guns blazing (your  choice),get masks and/or mods, buy weapons,go infamy(reset your level while keeping any mods,masks, and weapons). All characters are the best (Cops,Heisters everyone),l salute the voice actors and want to shake their hand for making THE best voice acting in all games especially Clover, everytime l play Payday 2 l always play as Clover because her voice is perfect l love her accent , she is also beautiful and cute,when play as her l play better is like music in my hears and speaking about the music, the music is badass, one of the best.  The enemies are balanced espcially the special enemies, you need to stick together after all this is a co-op game. Tazers,Shields,Bulldozers,Skulldozers ( only on Deathwish), Cloakers ( and please stop whining that Cloakers are OP if you don't want to get kicked by them you got 2 options:  1 Stay close to your crewmates and remember their hiding spots and aim for the head or 2 Have the counter strike skill aced and hold your melee button, that will let you counter the Cloaker attacks, a taste of their own medicine) Snipers can be annoying sometimes they can take almost all your Life Bar and please fix their aim, they see me in 0.5 secs when their backs are turned ( 360 and everything) and BAM l'm dead. But sometimes your worst enemy can be your own crewmates like hosts who kick because for no reason ''Hey why you are using a suit in a loud heist'' Gets kicked after that, you know it,it happened to everyone if you want to understand more go see videos '' Payday 2 in a nutshell'' you will understand.That's why is better to play it with friends  Weapons, skills, perk decks are all great You can stealth heists ( not all heists, stealthing heists is better because you get a bonus exp and won't be any police but you got to be patient, know the map and the patrol routes like the back of your hand espcially on DW and/or when you solo stealth, you got only 4 pagers answers that means you can kill only 4 guards you must be as mentioned above, everything, an expect ninja/ghost  Heists/jobs have a very high replayability ( you can say it is over 9000) and are very well made, l'm looking forward for more fun heists.  l even played Payday 2 on PS3 maybe it didn't have any stuff that the PC has but even then the game had very high replaybility l never got bored of it, the randomness of every heist always gets me want to play it.  l love this game! One of my favorites,All characters are super funny,their lines are the best like: ''You're up against a wall, and l'm the ********* wall'' Bulldozers/Skulldozers ''Now go to the forums and cry like the little ****** you are'' Cloaker '' l got your DLC right here'' Cloaker ''Who sold us this drill, the cops?'' Houston And the most famous of all ''Get the **** up'' All heisters And so on Another problem Payday 2 has is the hackers.Beating all heists on DW in a matter seconds ( god mode and so on) they don't even deserve the mask and they got no honor, l hope Overkill do something about them  l salute you Overkill and thanking you for making one of THE BEST games ever 11/10 would get the **** up and play as Clover all day every day  Sorry for any mistakes l'm not good at writing reviews ( a bad writer) Also this was one of my first reviews so don't expect anything",

The thing that baffled me was that they put how to fix this problem ON THE TITLE SCREEN. I mean, seriously? Tell people how to get the game, in the game. Good job guys, regroup next week. Once those problems were fixed, the game was mostly enjoyable.   Some skills were and still are almost a complete waste of time. Take Insider Man for example. The worst heist it applies to is the Bank. It gives you the same blueprints of the bank everytime. So 50% of the time. you were tricked. Although it's easy to see right away in the mission that the asset was wrong and change the plan, you've still wasted the money and skill poits on it. What so you think of when you hear Stockholm Syndrome? Was it someone being held captive? No, that would be insane. The Stockholm Syndrome skill will let nearby civilians revive you if you interact with them. The problem is, when you go down, you've been detected most likely and all the civilianns have ran. Now you might think a hostage could set do this if you are near one, nope. There are still other perks that act like these, but i mained Mastermind so these are the ones i am most familiar with.  Aside from the broken skills, the updates and dlc are what really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off about OVERKILL. After the rough launch day, they managed to fix some other bugs in the passing weeks. The only update that i actually enjoyed was the new stealth thing, where you now had a meter of detection for your overall loadout. The newer updates have really annoyed me. The introduction of Deathwish and the anti-farming feature, are what have made me give up hope for this game. Deathwish gives a miniscule exp and cash bonus and dumb achievements. With the anti-farming feature, it stopped people from farming Rats, however that put a damper on other jobs. If you do a pro job and fail then try again, you get reduced exp. If they never once thought that people would take advantage of the fact that Rats can take less than a 15 minutes to do, with a ton of exp to reap, then they should have just removed the option to blow up the meth lab in Day 1. Other holiday updates added achievements and masks that are impossible to get now, so if you were planning on acing the game, then good luck.  DLC. OVERKILL you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They have done nothing but cheat us of it. If you pre-ordered the game, you got the first DLC free. Even thought it was free, I still felt like my money was still stolen from my wallet. We were promised 5 DLC packs to come out by summer 2014, 3 have already been released and have been terrible. As mentioned, the first DLC, Armored Transport was a complete fail, adding stupid missions that were very hard and added nothing new. From the name, i assumed it would be something along the lines of shooting out the back of an armored car after a heist, or stealing back your loot from an armored truck after failing an escape. My second assumptions was half-fuffiled, but in an atrocious way. The other 2 DLC have been weapon packs, adding more unimportant weapons and repetitive achievement(a lot of 'wear this mask and kill X amount of people). I expect that the other 2 DLC that have yet to have been released will end up being more weapon packs.   After awhile, with so few heists and variety, the game gets boring. Some heists are completely useless to do after a certain point, like Jewelry Store and Four Stores.  Finally, (I can't remember if we were promised this or i made this announcement up) ADD SAFE HOUSE CUSTOMIZATION. I want to use my offshore money for something other than buying contracts and an over-priced slot machine. I want to know that I've moved from a mediocre laundromat, to a slightly fancier laundromat or anything else. Just let me buy a new base, so i know that all my hard work robbing and almost dying have been worth it.",

            "review_text": "PayDay 2 is an excellent game in regards to its focus on cooperation and gameplay. Now bring in Overkill's method of handling new content to the table and your wallet's in for a treat. After a while of play it does feel as if the game's content is severely lacking thanks to the overwhelming amount of paid downloadable content available. Unfortunately the paid downloadable content is the majority of the game's content. Without the game's downloadable content, you'll find yourself relying on others to play jobs and heists that you don't have access to. You'll also discover that you're missing out on alot, especially the game's vast amount of weaponry. Overkill really should have worked more content into the base game over time rather than having it be downloadable content.   Overall it's a recommendation from me as it can be extremely fun with friends and randoms alike. If you enjoy the base game, a good sum of the available downloadable content packs add even more to the experience. Just be wary this game can vary well lead to an empty wallet. I bought it on sale during Steam's last Winter Sale and since then I've spent plenty on it to keep me entertained. Think of it this way, it's like buying a house but when you go to your newly owned property to move in you realize there's only the foundation in place. Each DLC builds onto the foundation which eventually makes it a full fledged game. Either way, if you decide to build upon the foundation or not it's still worth checking out!  Update:  Thoughts on microtransactions? All I have to say is, props to Overkill for ruining their reputation even further by adding microtransactions.   Note: Is it a coincidence that positive reviews for this title were suddenly deemed unhelpful just after the addition of microtransactions? I think not. I find that funny, as I for one don't approve of Overkill's poor choices when it comes to how they handle the game's new content either.",

Do I want to pay $5 (a quarter of the game's price) to get access to ONE new character that I can play as? (purely cosmetic)  No. Not really.  Would I recommend this game?  Sure. Just don't think you should buy the DLC. You can still play the heists (just you can't load them up yourself, you need to join someone who has it up)  I don't enjoy saying this. I've had &gt; 350 hours of fun playing this game, so that's a testament to its playability. However, don't spend all of your money. I bought a lot of DLC for this game, and I don't regret it, but I'm at the point where I don't WANT to buy any more. PAYDAY 2 has ripped out my wallet and taken more than $50... when the DLCs themselves only provide 20-40 minutes of stuff.  Sure, heists aren't  too  repetitive, but they get a little repetitive.

This awesome game has good and frequent support and patching, although it was already nearly perfect at launch. I mean they gave a new map and 4 masks with an update, do i have to say more?!

So, here's my review :  Gameplay is very good, you play with 3 other people cooperatively in a heist mission to steal some money or make something. The way you relay on someone to NOT get caught is really good. However, the hostage system is kinda whiny, you just tie them, move them, and done. Sure, you get longer cooling down for police assaults, but they are 'hostage'. Why can't i move them by shoving and pointing gun at them when you escape? This is the only downside of the gameplay for me.  Graphics are really good, but please make a 64-bit version of the game. When i played first, the game lagged to 26 FPS even after i set it to the lowest quality. Only after 2-3 times playing, the FPS increased.  DLCs really need to be increased in quality. Sure, some DLCs are good, bringing up some good weapons to buy, but some are just kinda repetitive and just got thinked out by the Devs for 2 minutes. I haven't bought any heist DLCs, so i'm not gonna review it here.  For those of you who are worrying about the community, don't worry. Overall, the people here are very nice (well, some are serious jerks). Just don't do mistakes on purpose, we hate guys doing that.  Here are the scores for me :  - Gameplay : 9/10 - Graphics : 9/10 - Overall : 9/10  Final words, i am recommending this game, it is very good. If you decide to buy it, add me as a friend so we can play together :D",

A normal guy, in that position, can easily stand up and escape... but apparently there aren't smart cops. - I can rob the same bank multiple times for different reasons and they never increase their security.",

Even the monitor and the headset was terrible to use, the headset didn't block any sound of the surroundings from the event making us unable to hear each other even when we even we maxed out the sound of our voices. We even got terrible FPS drops making the game feel very laggy due to streaming the game (through steam) from the computers.

Whisk the eggs: Crack both eggs into a mixing bowl. Whisk the eggs until completely combined, and season with salt and pepper. If you\\'re adding cheese or other fillings, make sure they are prepped and nearby. 2. Warm the skillet and melt the butter: Place an 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat and melt the butter. Tilt the skillet as the butter melts to evenly coat the bottom. When the butter stops sizzling, the pan is heated and ready. 3. Pour the eggs into the skillet: Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet. Immediately tilt the pan so the eggs coat the entire bottom. The eggs should sizzle on contact; if not, continue cooking, but remember to heat the pan a little longer next time. 4. Drag and push the eggs to form waves: Use a spatula to gently drag and push the cooked eggs from the edges toward the center of the pan, making space for the uncooked eggs and forming waves in the omelette. Tilt the skillet so that the uncooked eggs flow into the open spaces. 5. Cook the omelette for 1 to 2 minutes: The omelette will finish cooking in 1 to 2 minutes. When done, the bottom will be set and the edges will look crisp. The top of the omelette should still look fairly wet and uncooked, but there will no longer be any loose, easily flowing liquid egg — the omelette will continue cooking off the heat, so finish when you think the top still seems a bit underdone. 6. Top with cheese and fillings: If using, sprinkle the cheese and fillings down the center of the omelette. 7. Fold the omelette: Fold the bottom third of the omelette over the center, and then fold the top third down. Alternatively, fold the omelette in half. 8. Slide the omelette onto a plate: Gently slide the omelette onto a plate and garnish with parsley. Eat right away while still hot.",

If you were to have sunglasses as a mask, then having them off wouldn't make anyone suspicious, but when you put them on, to cops and civilians, you immediately look like you're going to cause chaos and destruction.

I loved the idea of being in a criminal's shoes, executing heists and battling against different types of law enforcers. I loved the huge customization abilities in the game. You could choose from a hundred masks, change the look of it, put on patterns of different colours and get a very unique mask tailored to your tastes. I loved the feeling of planning out heists with your friends and trying if it works. I loved the skills and perks you can choose to make dozens of possible builds. I loved the adrenaline you get when doing stealth, always on the edge of your seat trying not to mess up and get caught.  It was my most favourite game in the world. For a while.  I stopped playing for a few months due to exams and when i got back, I cleared my progress, raring to try out the updates. But then I realised something. In short terms, it was a mess. dozens of DLCs were pumped out while I was gone. everything was not user-friendly. After playing some more, it honestly felt like an early-access game. Unless you follow the development of the game closely from the beginning, you will have problems understanding. You would have questions like 'Eh? How come there's this old japanese dude with me suddenly? what's the story there?' 'Whose locke? so Murkywater is our friend?' and then you play one of the older heists and 'what!? so we became rivals all of a sudden? or were we rivals from the start?' 'Why is this Jimmy dude asking us to go scan bodies in a russian lab all of a sudden?! Where did Jimmy come from?! What's Akan!?'   I hope you can see what I mean. They made a mess. I felt like that moment where you come home and see your house torn up by your pet. They didnt bother ordering the missions they pumped in, expecting each player knows what is what. you have to watch an entire movie worth of trailers to barely understand. I spent hours on google and youtube just to figure out what is happening in the 'storyline'. They shouldn't just put up a screen where random missions appear and you just choose from there. They should make a mission tree or something, unlocking more heists as you progress. I've seen so many new players go on missions i would imagine they would find immensely hard and confusing/  What makes me more dissapointed is that they locked most of these updates behind a paywall. almost half the weapons, characters, heists and other stuff is DLC. You gotta invest like a hundred dollars just for the full game.  TL;DR  This game is a good game. but it used to be better. much much better. back then i would have given it a solid 10/10. now I'd give it a 6/10. unless you're willing to buy 100 dollars worth of DLC and hours watching DLC trailers to figure out the story, don't buy it. The DLCs are basically game updates.",

However, it makes up for this with outstanding graphics, intense gameplay and addicting features that will keep you coming back for more. They have a leveling system that keeps you interested, which is in ordinance with the skill points. There is also four different 'classes' you can go into with different perks.

So why players deal with the cops while driving with cops? Nope Timer to escape is just nightmare on normal i can dealth with,but ON DW?! Nope i can only dealth with it with player driving with car and i sitting. 7/10 Best Game but it needs be fixed.",

Neverending PvE: 4 humans against droves of weak fools and a few oddities in multiple scenarios trying to achieve some objective other than survival. The differences are why people started playing this game back when it came out and also why so many have 'left'. The DLC went from free, to paid, to pay2win, to cosmetic. Pay2win in a PvE. Bleh. The gunplay in this game is more than addictive, it's somewhat empowering. When playing with no latency on a great processor, the NPCs will give a great challenge at higher difficulties.  The meta is deeper than expected for an FPS, treating it much like an RPG. Skill trees and perk systems collide to allow dozens of playstyles, most able to integrate with other players' skillsets. Some skills improve your gun use, and others will allow for specialized weapons to be used. Multiple skills will give benefit to the whole team, but can not stack. Healers, tanks, rouges, and summoners all have their place in this modern crime game. The 'best' build ends up being an insta-reviver DPS, though.  With the choice of quiet or loud comes so many decisions, such as preparation for the possibility of failure. In many heists, stealth is damn near impossible to keep up. Some might choose to pack armor, others might choose to wear it from the beginning and bring an ECM jammer, and some who liken themselves to ninjas choose to bring nothing but two silenced pistols. Some people call this the best stealth game ever. I haven't played many others, but it seems about right to call it that. The guards have more sense than average and the visibility system can be brutal. Break a light? Guard figures s--- out and calls the cops. You'll never be able to truly see through walls with heat scanning, but your skills and leverage with employees will give you access to CCTV and motion sensors.

However, recently because I grew so utterly cold to it and have nearly no intention of coming back, I feel like I can finally write a very honest review about it. Payday 2 is an excellent game. At its core, it's extremely fun, hectic shooting, the feeling of bagging ever-expanding bags of loot, the feeling of tweaking weapons to fine points for just the right balance of power, the feeling of raw energy pumping through your veins as you wade through oceans of enemies and hope that you and your friends can hold the fort. Payday 2, in a vaccum, is one of the best games that I've ever played on a sheer 'game' level. Notice the 'in a vaccum' qualifier. Payday 2 as a study in game managment is a documentary about the willingless to make faustian bargains of your fans' adoration for yet more money. Remember those simple days when what we complained about were DLC's? Good times. Payday 2 has (off the top of my head) around 28 dlc's. Probably more, and soon. And they are for the most part worth the fairly reasonable price of 5-7.5$, with a few exceptions. At the start, they were mostly very content-intensive, with a lot of bang for your buck. That line started to sink, though, as it was releasing straight-up triple weapon packs, with some being themed super hard at the expense of being actually useful. Some were straight up ads you payed for, like the Allesso and Point Break heists. That being said, both heists aren't bad because they're bad heists, they're bad on principle. These people collaborated with Goat Simulator. They have no shame when it comes with who they collaborate with and then asking you to pay to see the extended advertisment. And then the microtransactions. If you have any gripes with microtransactions in this game now, you weren't there when they hit. It was ♥♥♥♥ing D-Day. They added stat bonuses to certain skins so you could actually shell out money for an in game boost. No, I'm not talking about a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile game, I'm talking about the game that I just praised extensively. There was so much ♥♥♥♥ flying at Overkill and anyone who dared be affiliated that it's astonishing that Overkill fixed it so slowly. Now, they're basically just skins from CS:GO or one of the seventy games that are realizing where the real money is now. They are, in retrospect, much improved from the old way. The boosts are now seperate and you can't go six heists without tripping over one. At this point, I'd played so much of the game that I was already experiencing some shock fatigue on the whole 'Ovk are milking us' argument. And now, after the smoke cleared, my hypothesis is that they aren't just milking the oldies, but trying to usher in any new players they can into their elaborate mousetrap. This is a vicious cycle. But through all that, the misuse of the community, the constant dlc's, and the paid advertisements, I find that I can still reccomend this game. It's been a bumpy ride, and Overkill are still shifting things around with dangerous potential to ♥♥♥♥ everything up, but if you strip away all that political crap, buy yourself an eco list of dlc, and play the game, you'll have a ♥♥♥♥ing blast. This game is great, and though I grew tired of it, you may not have to live in the world of DLC milking and microtransactions that I did.   TL;DR: Stay smart with your money, and you'll have fun. Don't, and you're just another pawn.",

With the DLC that adds alot and its cheap :D, And the fun the game gives you several options to do the missions. I give this game, A 9.8 out of 10.

Many complain about there being too many DLCs, but the DLCs are great and fun. DLCs are as optional as it gets and doesn't spoil the game in anyway. Without the DLCs , the game is still a blast and with or without friends you can still have tons of fun. The game is challenging in a good way even though you are up against AI Bots. The mechanics of the games is just one of the best out there, along with these devs that are not money sucking ******s like the games of last year(2014) and this year (2015). There are DLCs that add to the game and provides TONS of fun that is way above the price you paid for. Again the game is still great without them but would make you j**z your pants if you got them.

            "review_text": "Payday 2 (I can't understand point of using capital letters as name) is First-Person Shooter with with emphasis on 4-player cooperation (which doesnt mean you cannot play it with smaller amount of players or even solo).  Goal of the game is to climb criminal ladder by increasing wealth, reputation and later infamy levels, gained by completing various heists. To do it, player has to get his mask, gun, unlock some skills with gained points and pick his character. All of it will be covered. Starting with heisters: at this moment (June 2016) player has 16 heisters to choose from - at least in theory. Some of them require you to buy character pack dlc, others require joining PD2 Steam group, there is even one that requires you to complete specific heist (game lore; this heister was member of original Payday gang back in PD: the heist, but got incarcerated between games. Now has to be broken out of prison). Characters themselves are purely cosmetic - they differ only with appearance (if you play as one - all you see are their arms) and voices. Pool of heisters include vast amound of different criminals: from professional bank robbers, through hitmen, burglar, adrenaline junkie to former yakuza member. There is even a coke-addicted psycho, so as you can see, you have a lot to choose from.  Masks. Place to show your artistic nature. Starting with characters original masks, playing more heists gives you more card drops (after heist, you have to pick one from 3 cards, containing random mask, material, pattern, colour, weapon mod, cash, exp or skin safes), which gives you masks and materials to customiste them. To do it, you pick mask then material, pattern and colour, then pay customising fee. There are so called infamous drops: special, extremly rare items, being so special for their looks, for example golden material. Just go, play and get more stuff and create cool masks.  Weapons - only fool would try to rob a bank without a weapon. There are lots of weapons aviable, with mods to further customise them: grips, sights, stocks, sometimes ammo - whatever you want. Player can take primary and secondary into battle, choice ranging from assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, SMGs and even granade launchers and Flamethrower.  There are also melee weapons. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of them. Prison shanks, knifes, axes, or even greatswords. There's lots of stuff to pick to suit your playstyle. Only problem: lots melees and guns are locked behind DLCs.  Skills. Players get one skill point per level. They are plenty skills in 5 skill trees (each contains 3 subtrees). There is no way to unlock every skill, so you have to choose what you need more. Skills give you advanage on the cops. You can get large damage bonus on suppresed weapons, be able to revive teammates by shouting at them, increase damage on selected weapon group, get stronges armor ect. Pick whatever you need.   Perk decks are ncie sidekick to skills, giving you additional edge. They direstly influence your playstyle: some perkdecks focus on helping your teammates, giving you enought dodge stat to play without armor, heling from kills, melee hits and so on. You unlock them with leveling up: recieving exp will also give you perk points on differing conversion rates. Then you unlock the perks, equip them and kill the cops. By the way, these are sets, you pick whole set, not just couple of skills.   Heists. There are lots of them, but they aren't really common heisters jobs. I feel Payday crew should be called terrorists: there are of course regular jewelry store hits, banks of various sizes. There even is a nice, big casino. So why terrorists? At some point gang hits paramilitary base (4 times), stealing nukes, cooking meth, derailing the train with bomb, and so on. Huge amount of heists, nice payouts - just keep heisting.   While most of heists are to be completed loudly. There are also ones that are to be done quietly. This is challenging, but gives a nice exp stealth bonus. Also, there are no waves of cops to kill you.   Gameplay itself is simple. We have waves of cops trying to bring you down, when you have to complete objectives (mostly this broke ♥♥♥♥ piece of ♥♥♥♥ drill). Cops have special units, like heavily armored buldozers, tasers, shields and my favourite sneaky cloakers - guys who can down player with one hit. Players hate them.  Players being downed have 30 seconds to be revived, otherwise they go into custody. Then they can be traded for taken hostages. Thats it in short.   DLCs. In no other game review I would mention them, but here they are quite a fuss among players. As for me, this is the way of keeping the game alive even through the time that passed since launch. And as nobody wants to work for free - that's why they are paid.   Overally, I like that game - watching how my ingame accounts increase all the time, kill cops, hitting stores ect. If you enjoy coop games (even though some people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and like being the bad guy - just buy it.",

Well, I recommend playing this with a 4 people all in a group call, you won't get enough fun if you're on your own, with people you don't even know, even worse, a silent game, where nobody communicates. But sometimes, you play this game on your own, its either you jump into a game where people think they know what they're doing and then just messing up the whole heist, or you meet a player that has good leadership qualities and actually brings success to the whole squad.",

Some others say Payday: the heist is better because its 'harder' well this is just as hard in my opinion( i bought the paydya:the heist because of payday 2) but paydyay: the heist has much less police forces for you to deal with. I am near certain you will enjoy this game as much I do and with that, I ORDER YOU TO BY THIS GAME INSANTLY!!!",

A current player considering whether or not to buy some/all of the DLC.  A current HATER on OVERKILL for making all the paid DLC. (You know who you are)  Just because this game has a ton of DLC, that DOESN'T mean you have to buy it to have fun. The game is fun with or without it.   There are 19 paid DLC in all, including 10 Weapon/Mask Packs, 5 Heist/Weapon/Mask packs, 2 Character/Weapon/Mask Packs, and 2 Soundtrack/Mask packs. If you were to purchase all of them at once (excluding PAYDAY 2 itself) when they're NOT on sale, it would cause a total of $108.82. That's more than 3.5 times the price of the base game!  But here's something people need to know about the DLC before they buy it (or hate on it): IT'S NOT REQUIRED TO PLAY OR HAVE FUN! All the DLC is extra content that can appeal to certain players. If it was required, they would have included it in the base game!   To be honest, when I buy PAYDAY 2's DLC, I don't think of it as buying DLC. It's more like making a 'Donation of Appreciation' to OVERKILL to let them know that I still love the game and will continue to play it. Why? For two reasons: First, because all the DLC is cheap, and second, because it’s NOT REQUIRED!   So here’s my message to you:  Possible Players: If you are serious about getting PAYDAY 2, just get the base game and no DLC to start off with. If you are unsure, try the demo first.  New Players: If you like the game and want to give back, start with one DLC of your choosing and see how it goes from there.  Current Players: If you love the game and want to give back, buy the any DLC(s) that you want.  Current HATERS: If you don’t like the fact that they made all the paid DLC, just don’t buy it. If you hate OVERKILL because of the paid DLC, just DON’T BUY IT! If you just hate PAYDAY 2 in general, and hate on it because you think current players have to buy it to continue playing, that’s NOT TRUE! Finally, if you think PAYDAY 2 is the worst game known to man and just want something to complain about, SIT DOWN, SHUT UP, and play something else!  9/10 Would retaliate against HATERS again! ",

            "review_text": "While the learning curve is a little higher than most FPS out there, it is a tremendously enjoyable game. It has a lot of depth and re-playability thanks to the skill trees/perk decks, countless weapons/mods and so many varied heists. The story is a little disconnected because you can play the heists in any order but you can eventually piece it together. The Web Series and DLC trailers are also very good sources for the story. The characters are quite likable as well. The sounds, graphics and gun play are very satisfying. The ability to play many mission loud (guns blazing) or stealth is rather entertaining as well. While going loud is fairly straightforward, stealth is the tricky part to master. 9/10, because the game has a couple glitches and crashes that can get a little annoying.  Edit 10-18-2015 : Despite having mentioned in the past that microtransactions would never be implemented, they eventually added it during a 'free' event. I have nothing against microtransactions for games that are cheap, free or have no DLCs. However Payday 2 is not free and it has a lot of PAID DLCs. I would be ok with such a system in that game under two conditions : - do not force players to spend money in order to open their safes. It could be done through drops or special events. People that still wish to open their safes faster would be free to use the market. - do not provide stats with cosmetic paid items, that is technically PAY 2 WIN even though it is only a PvE game.  Edit 10-28-2015 : Drills are now a drop but they are so rare I have seen only one drop (a friend got it) in about +100 games. Overkill management and PR is really poor (looks at Bo and Almir), they mentioned having increased the team from 25 to 75 and yet can't find resources to fix core engine issues like desynch, crashed lobby, client side stealth issues, server migration...). And that's not even mentioning the poor Console support.  Edit : November 2015 : The COP final reward dropped. it was 1 / 25 skins as promised but ... of varied conditions, different rarities and some have boost. Where are the skins they promised would be cosmetic only made with love and care when you get a completely scracthed up skin? Not to mention that 3 skins are Legendaries and have not dropped as of December 16th, 2015. I am starting to question the Legendary drop rate now. Overkill acknowledge they ♥♥♥♥ed up and stated they will go back to the drawing board. The Point Break heists are both pretty good and really action packed. Most of all is no drill waiting and a couple interesting mechanics.  Edit December 2015 : Overkill announced stat &amp; team boost will be added as free drop in the form of mods. There will be 10 of them collectable through the card drop or a monthly side job. You would think it would be the perfect time to replace stat boost skins with a cosmetic replacement like stat track or visual effects... but no. Overkill wants to favor rich players by leaving them the options to instantly buy power/stat without having to wait or earn a drop like the regular players. Overkill also came up with a suggestion for the botched COP reward. They are now polling forum users for a list of 10 masks to be 'mega-fied'. I suggested to do all remaining and future heisters in order to keep style consistency with the 4 original megas. But you would be amazed at the amount of trolling or maybe just purely bad taste going as suggestions, Kawaii being among the most named.  February 2015 : A lot has happened since the last update. The boost mods are very common and drop fairly regularly, making stat boost skins pretty much pointless. I am thinking they should think about converting those to something else, like Stat Track or cosmetic effects.  As for heists, I have been pretty impressed. Point Break is great and nice change of pace and gameplay. Santa's workshop is predictable but still much more enjoyable than Cook Off / Labs Rats or White Xmas. The Goat heist is hard and lenghty but overall pleasant (I have yet to do it on DW).  COP, 3 masks have been revealed, they look ok but I was hoping for more heisters masks. Hopefully the next one improve upon the 3 earlier ones.  Just today, the Wolf Pack has been announced. It contains ports of Undercover and Counterfeit and is free from Owners of PD:TH Wolfpack. Which is a pretty nice move. Overkill has also improved their PR, but it is not yet up to the level I would like. The changes and good content released the past 3 months reflected positively on the company and the game. I will recommend that game once more.  2016-11-23 : lots of stuff happened, community safes, new levels, new difficulties and long awaited safehouse was released. Also a huge mess up with Community skins and COP safes being awarded to people who should have them is being cleared up by valve. Otherwise I am mostly working on the badge xD",

There is a lot to do and many achievements to go for. There are many weapon choices and attachments to customize your gun with! The stealth mechanic really really out does itself. There are many missions, that involve stealth, going loud, or both! There are many hours to put into this game with 100 level's for each imfamy and 25 imfamy's, each one giving you special loot that other wise cant be obtained.  Pro's  -There are a total of 23 Primary gun's without paying for any dlc's. (50 with all of the dlc's) -There are a total of 19 Secondary gun's without any dlc's. (34 with all of the dlc's) -Total of 84 gun's which makes a variety of guns to use. -There are 9 melee weapon's without dlc's including: Money Stack, Boxing gloves, Brass Knuckles, and more! (50 Including dlc's) -There are 100 level's in 1 imfamy -There are 25 Imfamy's (At the time of this review) -The skill perk system is very usefull depending on if you want to go stealth or go loud. -A wide variety of mission's to complete. -Stealth is amazing, really well done mechanic. -There are many dlc's for your taste. -About 90% of people are nice in this game.  -Infinate amount of mask variation's with the: Paint's, Material's, and Design's.  Con's -Going imfamy only takes about 1 and a half days if you grind the game. -It gets repetitive after about imfamy 5-10. (Depends how you play) -The dlc weapon's feel superior then base weapon's. -The difficulty difference between overkill and deathwish is way to much. -There is a lack of team communication. -Some of the perk deck's are far superior then other's.

Compared to everyone else, i wouldn't say i have a mass amount of hours, however i have played this long enough to know that this is an outstanding game, i first started playing in December 2013, and the game has come a long way, generally i would take a game, and try to find things to critise things about it so i can address what needs improving, and honestly, there is only one trait to this amazing game.  The content released is generally brilliant, i take on board amount people dissing the micro-transactions, and the practical hault of free-DLC, but honestly, i almost own every DLC in this game, and i am proud to own every one of them, each one has there own unique boosts, not forgetting to mention the large variety of DLC Guns, the free guns that you get with the base game are amazing too, but in my opinion, the DLC in this game is worth the investment in order to increase the overall enjoyment and experiences you will face in this game.  As you can see, i have quite a significant amount of hours on this game, and i felt it would be appropriate that i wait quite a while so i can compare where Payday was, and is now, and honestly i can say right now, that the only direction this game has been heading in is a good one, content is amazing, of course no game is perfect, but this is one of the games out there that is closest too it.  As i said earlier, there was one thing i could critise about this game, and only one, and that is the mass amount of de-sync you can find in the co-op stealth, if your the host, you will not experience this, but if you have your buddy as a host, and yourself as a player, then the desync plays as a major negative factor in this game, because you can quickly run past a guard, and when your in cover only then does your detection begin to go up, and sometimes i've actually been detected 3-4 seconds or even more after getting past the guard, this kind of encourages me to play in this way because i think that i am able to do things that i clearly find out later, due to desync slapping you in the face, that you cannot actually do, you might be crouching infront of a guard from significant distance, and then go into cover, but then he started seeing you because of the siginificant amount of desync, i'm not going to go to far into this, but the players that enjoy stealth, and have played for a time, generally get the idea, that desync, if your not the host, is a REAL pain, as i have mucked up the heist many times because of the de-sync issue.  Apart from that one little negative factor, the game is overall amazing and i definitely recommend it to people that enjoy working as a team, or even solo if you really wish, to push to complete the objective in a team of fighting waves of enemies, or just the guy, that enjoys the solo, stealthy approach, this game is one of the best out there, and although this game has been critised a lot in the past, i support the developers for how far they have came, and even till this day does this game still has a mass amount of potential, this my friends, is one of the best.",

That's the only time it will be fun to play  Let's start with one of the biggest problems- The community. The community is absolutely atrocious. You will mostly find people playing the Hoxton breakout, Cook Off, or Election day. And the moment they see you as a low level, you will get instantly kicked. The moment they see you don't have the right item, you're kicked. And everyone practically insults each other one every. Single. Thing. It's atrocious.  Back in PAYDAY: The Heist, people were more focused on working together to get a job done. Now, the game has turned into a grind and cash grab. You will visit the heists I mentioned above to get more experience so you can level up, buy more skills, more guns. And when you hit level 100, you will eventually become infamous, because stealthy heisters want to be more known [ Logic ]. And you will repeat this process... 25 times. Just for new masks. Becuase masks in this game are the equivalent of hats in TF2.   Next, the single player. If you enjoy playing single player, do not. I repeat, DO NOT get this game. The AI is pathetic, it will not do any basic objectives whatsoever. The only thing good about the AI is that they are good bullet shields and they will help you up when you're downed. Unless it's a tazer and the other AI is downed too, then it just glitches the hell out. They won't carry bags, fix drills, pick lock doors, etc. And for some reason, OVERKILL thought it was a good idea to only give you two AI instead of three when you play single player.   The biggest problem about this game is simply that almost everything is a DLC at this point. And the game feels so unfinished that it may as well be in early access. With over 100$ worth of DLC, you'll be required to spend more than 40$ just to get a good game experience with the weapons, heists, mods, etc. Pick them up when they are on sale, but it will still take a large chunk out of your wallet if you want to get the good DLC's, or all. I would honestly suggest just gettign Courier mod, and all the heists, so you can atleast change things up a bit.  Now, for the pros. The game is absolutely marvelous when you can play with your friends, and even better if you can talk to each other and play. Coordinating with your friends and actually managing to pull off a heist, whether stealth or loud, is extremely satisfying and keeps you coming back to play the game, over, and over, and over again. Only with friends, however. But that teamwork between your small four man crew is great. And you'll go on to play more heists... If one of you buys them.   I would only suggest getting this game if you have friends who are willing to get it too, or already have it, or you plan to get a four pack to give to your mates. Because the only way this game will ever be fun is when you're playing with your friends. No other time. Yes, they may keep dishing o9ut DLC's, but that also just means updating it regularly. For a price. Still, amazing game.   TL;DR version  Single player- Horrible.  Community- OH GOD NO. BACK HISSSSSS.  DLC's-SO... SO... MANY...  Updates- Very Frequent. Playing with friends- Amazing.  Only get if you have friends to play with.  6.5/10",

I've played many of these hours with just one freind, and it's great fun, but this game becomes its full self when you have a full team with three more freinds, and the hilarous times just never cease.  Probably one of the best games of the generation, though the only downside (for some) is the frequency of the DLC releases. I don't care about that, as the DLC is cheap enough and of reasonable quality, though it could be offputting to some. Overkill are very nice about it though, as to play some of the DLC heists, only the party leader needs the DLC, so it doesn't cause any rifts in the players.  Some won't find it good enough for a full price game + all DLC, but make sure you pick up at least the base game next sale. 8/10",

I love it, I just had one problem, OVERKILL said that they won't be realising DLC anymore. They also say that, 'we are RETIRING the updates for XBOX 360 and PS3.' This is a bad thing on my view, I have a medium PC, it's not so good, I can't play many games on my PC with high graphics. So PAYDAY 2 is meh. So I play on my XBOX 360. But nobody cares that OVERKILL has a line, the 360 and the PS3, may not have enough memory, I can understand that, I think the reason why OVERKILL stopped dev. on 360 and PS3 is that, it takes a long time to proccess through Microsoft's consoles, and Sony's. I think why they said 'it doesn't have the amount of memory' is so people don't get annoyed that they have to buy a hard drive. It's a bad idea though, people will be annoyed by this, but less will be if OVERKILL continues to make updates. Anyway they made a great console game, but failed to please all... or did they? I just realised this, they said they're nmot making anymore DLC for 360, or PS3... they never said anything about the XBOX ONE or PS4. Anyway, I don't think over kill wants to stop making updates, I think they have to. By the time we get to the 100th update, it'll take about 1 Terrabyte. So yeah, if OVERKILL wants to make more, they can make more, if they don't let them be. Anyway just buy a PC. There is a PC for 350$ that gets up to 60FPS for PAYDAY 2. So just go buy that, okay bye!

The game is a fun shooter once in a while but after 10+ hours it becomes a grind.

Sure, messing around for a bit with friends is fun, but when you have to play the same maps over and over to grind exp it gets boring. If this was ftp I wouldn't complain, it would be perfect, but the fact that there is so much pay to win dlc is really off putting. Don't buy the game if you play by yourself, and certainly don't buy the game if you hate paye dlc in a payed game.",

I would like to see a payday 3 with new and improved graphics and maybe allow me to build a house on a server or my own computer and stack all my guns on the wall or something cool. I think shifting the player to his house where people can chat and come over would be cool while waiting for the next game.

Cheaters are hacking lvl progress, lvl-up,weapons.Bugs with an alarm and running hostages. 505 Games just don't care about theirs servers and produces uninteresting DLCs, I want to missions with 7 days.

The heists can be a lot of fun and there used to be tons and tons of positive things to say about the game.   However the developers released a constant stream of what could reasonably be called over-priced DLC to fund the game. A lot of it included superior gear and such, which smacked a bit of P2W but end of the day at least they were continuing to actively support the game and that's a good thing. Buying all the DLC for this game is way, way, way more expensive than buying any other AAA title and all its expansions out there but at least it felt like a good sized chunk of content.   Then.... the 'drills and skins' fiasco. So they release power-ups on a micro-transaction scale. You buy drills for real money and they unlock new 'skins' for your gear that gives you significant in-game buffs. It is the fundamental deffinition of P2W. Anyone remember Gold Ammo on WoT before they recognized what a BS idea that was? It's exactly like that. The whole game is co-op, sure, but people compete. You compete to be good at the game, that's why it's multi-player. We all know that and without question Overkill knows that so they add a facet where you have to regularly spend extra money to compete. Then, to top it off, they nerfed everything that wasn't P2W. I'm not kidding - they nerfed all the non-P2W gear, then let you spend extra to get a skin that essentially un-nerfs it.   I'm all for people getting paid. I am. People getting paid for their work is reasonable. However either Overkill is the most fiscally incompetent company in the gaming industry or they're greedy as hell because their game, Payday 2, already costs more to buy all the content for than anything else you can pick up the complete catalog of on Steam. Then you get to spend money on micro-transactions like you're feeding quarters into the EA ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t dispensery in pure P2W BS.   ♥♥♥♥ Overkill so much. If you give them money, you're a chump. It's as simple as that.",

Free content, as in pay nothing, here's-some-free-stuff content. This is not free and Overkill is seriously pushing their community to the point of no return by adding microtransactions.

The game is constantly being improved though and content is added regularly. Maybe they should fix these and the clipping bugs first though before adding more cashgrabbing addons. Collecting the wanted mods for weapons can take a lot of time with grinding quick heists. Replay value is high on most maps, although some can get boring after mastering one even with the multitudes of ways on how to do a heist.

Do you like to break the law by robbing banks, making drugs, and beating people in the face with the butt of your weapon, but are too much of a wimp to ACTUALLY do it in real life? Well don't fear, thats the exact reason why OVERKILL made this game! (Probably not but, you know what I mean). Grab 3 friends, 2, 1, or just play with the bots (who can be brainless), in one of the best co-op games ever made! You want to cook meth? Do the Rats heist and be just like Heisenberg! Want to rob some huge rich bank full of loot? Go ahead and find The Big Bank heist and silently get all the loot, or brutally murder everyone in your way for the riches awaiting in the vault! This game will certainly be the most fun you will ever have! Oh did I mention you can also punch babies? (Just kidding you can't punch babies, but you can still punch bank tellers from raising the alarm). This is probably my favorite game in my library, and for me it never gets old! (OVERKILL did not pay me to say that, I actually mean it). GET THIS GAME OR YOUR NOT A MAN! (You can still be a man without playing the game, but you'll be a manlier man) And if you just buy the game from reading this review, feel free to add me on your friends list and I'll be glad to help you on your first days of heisting!",

I'm thoroughly impressed with PayDay 2 and will continue to play it for a long while.  EDIT: 02/09/16 - Recommend status back to Yes.  OVERKILL, since the Crimefest 2 update, have made several changes to Payday 2 which completely compensated for the Black Market travesty. New DLCs, free and paid all excellent additions to the game, with all the poor Steam users whining about how the DLC is priced. Do I have to bring up Train Simulator with it's couple thousand dollar DLC price tag? The newest update with the readdition of the Wolf Pack DLC, FREE for those who owned the Wolf Pack in the first Payday: The Heist gave me hope that they're on the right track again.",

Rubbish! First off, what annoys me the most is the fact that if you want to use a gun you get notified that it’s DLC. Now, that nonsense … it’s using the games as “milk cows”. In other words you buy an uncompleted game. My opinion … give me all the contents that needs to be there and name your price. Secondly the AI are idiots. They run after you wherever you go instead of giving proper support. If you need to recover equipment or bags of money they do squat. You have to move from A to B and do everything. You needs to setup, drill, and give covering fire, die, etc., while the idiots run around blindly and don’t give covering fire. Next, what astounds me about Payday 2 (as in Payday) is the amount of policemen in this place. You keep on shooting, they keep on going down and still they keep coming. It’s like a river of cops! And then the next day you do a job, all those cops that where taken down are back, whether they were wounded or killed, they are back on duty. It must be the same cops or they spawn from outer space. I don’t know. What a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ police department to work for … you get shot, just see to it you’re back tomorrow. Well what’s there to say about the graphics? Not much. The game just doesn’t look good. I also find the interface unpractical. The idea of this voice of the unseen person that gives you your next mission I also find irritating. And last but not least the acting in the endless cut scene at the dentist is to say the least ridiculous and amateurish. I really to not find this game realistic and enjoyable. For me there is absolutely nothing positive to be said about Payday 2. It’s equally as ridiculous as Payday. I bought this on recommendation and on sale, but boy do I wish I could turn back time. I should never have bought this game.",

The other portion of the gameplay involves looking at a timer count down until you can move to the next objective, where you will watch another timer countdown, and then another....until you finish the level.  Despite attempts to implement a strategy element into this game, there still isn't any. There are different branching classes that you can pick but there are clearly optimal ways to skill your character which generally involves getting as much tank as possible.  It's hard to recommend a game that shipped unfinished. The majority of the levels upon release were really just the same level with one alteration, and it remains that way today. The small number of actual missions to complete make this game something you can clear in a few hours with friends and the replayability value is really only in maxing out all your levels so you can become 'infamous' -- essentially, reset your levels like prestiging in call of duty.  This game actually had a lot of promise however it is squandered on poor level design where you're really only there to camp for X minutes while fighting enemies that have extremely poor AI and have predictable spawn points that you can camp.",

In the begging its much try and error, but when u know how to do the diffrent heists u can earn a lot of cash. The modding of the weapons is pretty good where u can do a loud gun with a lot of intemination or a quiet one to use in stealh. Diffrent classes where u can be a explosive expert and lay down trapps with c4 or put down a turretgun, a stealh class with a lot of concealment and lockpicking skillz.   Worth the money if u can play with a friend or more. Not quiet the single player game tho u can play with randoms if u want to, but the comms with a friend makes it a lot easier. A completly ok game and a lot of fun on late nights!",

Everything is amazing and so is the different various DLC you can buy for the game even though i would have preferred if the DLC where free.  Now the negativity stems from the community. The majority of players that play the game are immature and joining almost every game will get you kicked or you'll find yourself amidst inexperienced players who don't know what they are doing. Occasionally you'll come across some nice decent players, you'll work as a team and then you lose connection to the game. I've played 12 games in one sitting and i've either been kicked or lost connection to the game. Most of the time i feel like i am wasting time because in order to buy weapons or mods for weapons you need to pass a mission and get a huge amount of money and to even get experience points to level up you have to pass a mission. How can i pass a mission if i am losing connection to a game. Playing offline isn't fun too  I would recommend the game if you have nothing to do over the weekend but if you are a busy person like me and can't deal with losing connection to a game or being kicked from just joining a lobby or a game then by all means buy this game.",

            "review_text": "So,   The first thing you feel when jumping into the game is how badass the setting in. Woof, finally a good cops and robbers game! The music is fun and add a lot to the action sequences within the missions and it sets an awesome ambiance. The mechanics seem to be split up into stealth and combat, both of which are playable and fun. The shooter mechanics are at the standard of most FPS titles nowadays. The stealth mechanics are straightforward and are fun. Their features include guards on patrol with field of vision, cameras with dead zones and small objectives. While neither of these aspects are revolutionary, some innovation on the developer’s part is to meld them together nicely into missions where a mishap can turn a stealth mission into a hot fury of bullets and dead cops.  The challenge level and fun factor I find are linked to access to competent teammates, which are in turn affected by the amount of big guns or perk decks unlocked in DLC. While this is somewhat of an annoyance, and you sometimes find crappy team mates, it hardly cripples the game on the spectrum of P2W. I see it as a coop game, and if your buddy has better guns you should be happy. It’s collective winning. If there were a PVP element I would disagree, but KD isn’t affected. You can still access DLC maps/heists if someone else hosts and get achievements for it, just not host the DLC maps you don’t have yourself.   As mentioned, DLC has a big impact on some of the character/weapon/class customisation options. If you don't have any DLC of which to speak of, you may find yourself underpowered in a few cases. They also have a whole micro transaction business model that apparently breaks the game. These come in form of safes, which are dropped randomly in loot at the end of heists along with the more rare drills. The drills can be purchased online and when combined with safes give a random weapon skin. Rarer weapon skins give damage boosts. Can you still have fun without them? Yes. P2W in a PVE setting isn't that bad all things considered and the advantages the skins give aren’t that gamebreaking.   Final verdict:  Fun, I like it. I bought it during the steam summer sale for cheap (less than 20$CAN) and it came with a bunch (4-6?) of DLC. I don't recommend getting it full price and paying for all the DLC at their current average price of 5$ CAN. If you do, it may end up costing something like 60$, the average price of a brand new game. If only Gabe Newell were a Marxist. But Obama just haad to ruin that.",

The game was released in 2013 and costs €28 as of today. This would be reasonable if you got all the DLC's (or atleast some), but no, to get that you need to pay €74 (!) for a GOTY version. That's just insane. The game is regularly on sale and advertised; I'm guessing a lot of people picked it up only to later find out about this DLC wall just like me.

I'd rate this game a 9/10 because after a while it can get boring  This game should be called Heist Simulator 2013. When the game had first came out it was the sequel to Payday: The Heist which i didn't like nearly as much as Payday 2. I didn't purchase Payday 2 myself a friend had purchased a 4-pack of the game before it had launched and asked me to play. This is one of the first games that i had on Steam on the day of release being one of the first 1000 players to log in i had instantly enjoyed it. The introduction was amazing, the characters seemed to have a huge backstory and was pretty good on it's own.  In Payday 2 the entire goal of the game is to break into vaults and complete missions setup through contacts such as Vlad, The Elephant and others, Ever mission has several difficulties that are increasingly more rewarding based on what difficulty you play.  Payday 2 is still very commonly updated and has a decent sized community although like other partially online games the community has been invaded by cheaters and people who ruin the game for others.   I should also mention that their are tons of weapons and upgrades, not to mention 4 unique skill trees that provide you with many benefits if you choose to pick one of these skill trees.   The heists are all very unique and have you doing a wide array of objectives from being a small town crook breaking into a jewelry store to stealing rare and expensive paintings to robbing national banks. This game even has you make meth and sell it.  A new addition to the game is the live-action intro for the game which couldn't be better put together and is just truly amazing and a great work of art, there should be a Payday 2 movie.  Although this game yields a lot of playtime, if you decide to play with random people you might encounter a hacker that will ruin your experience. After playing the game for a long time the game can lose it's value, but that doesn't matter because the next patch usually includes new heists or something to explore and see.  I rate this game 9/10.",

That's not to say it hasn't held some people's attention for much longer. Sadly, for me Payday is a fair use of the metaphor a mile wide and an inch deep. There is a lot here, but it's not exactly hard to get all of it. While missions can tense, exciting, or downright exhilirating at times, they're all just sbout the same thing. First, subdue the necessary guards. Secondly, find the vault. Third, protect the drill while it opens the vault. And finally remove money from vault, and move it to the van.

People who say they always get kicked normally have a reason. +The teamwork element of this game is fantastic. +Alot of variety in weapons +Game is not too demanding in specs. I'm running it on medium-high on my 1.5GHz AMD A4-5000 &amp; AMD Radeon 8330 +Loads of content +Lots of achievments +You have a sense of accomplishment (almost) every heist +As somewhat sais above, it encourages teamwork, but it's also just as fun if you want to play by yourself +Multiple ways to do (mostly) every heist. +99.9% of the glitches are hilariuos and not even game breaking. +In-depth skill system so you can choose what role you want to play on your team  The Bad - The third=person animations (but funny as hell) - There are alot of glitches and exploits to earn alot of money, ruining the fun factor and turns into Farming Simulator 2016. - The DLC in this game is fairly cheap, but is about $150 CDN for every single paid one. - This game is P2P (Peer to Peer) and the stability of the lobby depends all on the host. But usually it's on the Dev's side. - Lots of glitches (But like I said above, not game breaking)  The Ugly (Basically the complaints. There's gonna be long comments) - MICROTANSACTIONS: WHO CARES! The developers need money to make the game better so wether you choose to or not, it's up to you. It's not like other development companies have broken a promise. It's called Buisness. It happens.  - Hackers are about the game. But usually they host their own lobbies. If you're stupid enough to turn off auto-kick cheaters and you don't want cheaters, it's on you. Plus they're nice people. They just want to have more fun. - The content of some DLC is quite underwhelming, The Gage Historical pack is one. Even though the weapons are fun to play with, they're not too great.  That basically sums up my review. I would highly reccomend this game as long as you're not a butthurt about new things (and have friends). Wether you buy it or not is totally up to you. But If you do, buy the GOTY edition on sale. It usually goes for around $13 CDN. Now I leave you with a poem I made (maybe this will convince you more than my review did idk):  I was only 13 years old.  I loved PAYDAY 2 so much.  I had all of the DLC's. Even the Christmas Soundtrack. Every night I would Pray to Almir.  'Hoxton is love' I say, 'Hoxton is Life'.  My dad bursts into the room and calls me a cloaker. I knew he was just jealous of my Devotion to Hox.  I called him a level grinder. He slaps me with a money bundle and downs me. I'm in jail now. And my face is full of paper cuts.  Then I feel something touch me.  It was Hoxton!  I was ready.  I weakened my vault for Hoxton. He screams 'It's PAYDAY fellas!' and grabs me with his powerful, British hands. He starts to use his thermal drill to penetrate my vault.  The thermal paste hurt and melted my skin. There were 300 seconds left, but I was doing it for Hox.  He calls Bain and fills my offshore account with loadsamone and grinds me to the next infamy. Then my dad bursts into the cell.  Hoxton looks him in the eye and says:  'Did ya miss me ya ♥♥♥♥♥♥!?'.    He then get blown out of jail by the PAYDAY Gang.   Hox is love. Hox is life.",

I wouldn't want to play this with random strangers, but a lot of people do. The key is, teamwork is essential in this game, and communication is extremely important for teamwork.

            "review_text": "I have played this game for several months now, and it is incredibly fun!! You will play as a man who tries to do things that YOU actually want to do in real life but you can't. You can go rob a bank, steal some weapons, picklock doors, break some security cameras, shout at people and make them surrender to you, and throw three granades at your friends and leave alone. The DLCs are awesome. The good thing is that players won't hate each other when they see other players have bought DLCs; instead, the ones who do not buy DLCs happy to see those who buy DLCs because DLCs can help a lot in game, but it does not mean that if you just buy the game without DLC, you would not be able to play and clear each mission. The DLCs just make the game somehow more fun. It is not a must to beat the game though. That's just 0.5% of all the features it has. I can describe 100 times more than this and it'll be just 50% of the game's features. So, you should buy this game (when it's discounted to feel more happy to play with it) and play with your friends. Wait. What if you don't have any friends to play with? No problem. You can make friends in this game too since you can play it in online co-op mode that nobody would hate each other because all the players will help each other to pass a mission. However, the game currently has some flaws like glitches, hacks, and some graphic rendering that affects frame rate. If your computer or labtop does not meet the minimum specification requirement, you'd have a 'laggy' mouse problem that makes you almost unable to enjoy the game. Moreover, there're some connection problems that sometimes players will be disconnected from the host with no reasons even the connection update was just released. These issues will be fixed soon hopefully.  Since i bought this game as a Four Pack and in the Steam Summer Sale period, which is very very cheap, i will give it 9/10, but if i bought it with no discounts at all, i would give it 7/10.  I'm not a good English communicator nor a good game reviewer; so, I apologize for any mistakes that have made here.",

            "review_text": "I don't believe it. After 2.8 years, I'm actually about to recommend this game. This still comes with some heavy caveats, but it has at last reached a state that I can say is worth picking up. Two major changes have inspired this. One: The effective removal of microtransactions. This is hardly praise for the game, since it should never have been implemented, ever. However, of all the developers that have tried it, OVERKILL is the first I've seen that has actually canceled it after it was implemented. There is no way to completely remove them, since safes still exist in the game that require paid drills, which you can still buy for existing safes, but these safes will no longer drop in the game. All new safes will be free to open. I'm somewhat appalled at how quick the community was to 'forgive' OVERKILL with a flood of glowing reviews due to this change, even after their long-term treatment of the community. I don't think it's possible to forgive them. Again, it never should have happened in the first place, but the gesture is appreciated. Two: A rebalancing of skills in the game. Every single skill is now viable and worth picking up, and every skill in each branch is closely related to each other, so you never feel like you're 'wasting' points on one skill to reach another. Old 'necessary' skills are now unlocked for everyone without investment. You can try any combination of skills and still be useful to your team.  If you pick up the base game, everything has now been balanced well enough that the base weapons have decent variety and can be competitive with DLC weapons, but brace yourself for a massive wall of locked content. If you intend to pick up any weapon or character packs for the perk decks, spend plenty of time researching and reading reviews to see what's worthwhile for you. There are many heists you can't play, but you should be able to find someone who can host them for you. With the latest update, there is enough content and play variety to explore to keep you uniquely entertained for plenty of time to make it worthwhile...but it comes at the price of lots and lots of locked content, and a big, big install size. Think carefully before deciding how much to invest, because even though OVERKILL has been doing their best to make the right decisions after the Goat Simulator DLC (yes, really), we've been burned by them before.",

He grabs me with his powerful dodge build and puts me on my hands and knees I'm ready I ready my vault for Hoxton He drills into my safe It hurts so much but I do it for Hoxton I can feel the vault opening as my eyes water I push against his drill I want to please Hoxton He roars a might roar as he opens my vault with his thermal drill A cloaker walks in Hoxton looks him straight into the goggles and says 'It's payday fellas!'

However, had I not learnt anything, this game would have been different.  The game is addictive, at least for me. I can't stop getting to infamy 25, and to be honest it's one of the best co-op games I've played yet. The community is another thing. Sometimes, you will get kicked for no reason when joining a lobby, either it's just trolls or people thinking you're too ♥♥♥♥ and they can't be bothered teaching you because they will lose.  I could add more, but the only other thing is DLC simulator. Lots of cool stuff (I imagine at least) are locked behind piles of DLC costing $5 or more most of the time, and sometimes the DLCs that cost $1 when not in a sale are soundtracks, which provide no real gameplay attributes. You don't NEED to buy DLCs, however it becomes more and more enticing to do so as you fall behind in modifications and weapons. As of writing, I only have the Butcher's BBQ pack, and the Gage Mod Courier Pack, both of which hold up in value for money.  This is fast going down the current CS:GO route.  8/10",

            "review_text": "Payday 2 is a huge improvement over the first game. Although I enjoyed playing the first, I found several aspects of it quite basic and uninteresting, such as the level up system. In Payday 2, this level system has been thrown out and replaced with diverse skill trees and specializations for 4 different class types. The level system isn't the only improvement though. The weapons are much more realistic and fun to use and the sound effects are incredible (including the amazing soundtrack). The heists are more varied and much more complicated, with many different random elements that change every time you play.   It’s very satisfying to pull off a difficult heist and get paid lots of money. Compared to the first game, this money can actually be used to buy things! After you finish a heist, you will get a random drop of either weapon parts, masks (or mask parts), or extra money. These can be purchased and used to customize your gear. The customization of the masks is really interesting as there are supposedly hundreds of different options.  The gameplay is solid with intense firefights and good stealth opportunities. This allows heists to be completed in different ways. The special enemies from the first game make a return (although I haven’t seen any Cloakers yet). Something else that returns from the first game is the supremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ civilian AI. Quite often they will get up and run in front of players as they are shooting at police. Sometimes they even run away from the police which is understandable because the police pretty much use them as cover. This AI is the only core issue I have with Payday 2 so far. There are infrequent crashes, but I think these problems will be fixed in upcoming patches from Overkill.   I love Payday 2 and it’s one of my favourite co-op games ever. It’s fun, exciting, and good to play with friends. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy shooters and certainly to those who even remotely enjoyed the first game. You will get a lot of hours out of this one, I know I will :) ",

The only other huge issue I can really say are in this game are the cloakers. They instakill you and one cloaker can take out an entire 4 man team. This kind of sucks, especially if you join a game with noobs who can't quite find the 'f' key yet and revive you. In short, this game makes me very salty like a feminazi (capital letters are for important things, feminazis don't fit into this catagory for all the salty grammer Nazi's and other ♥♥♥♥♥), but it's still an alright game.

Whether it's robbing a simple bank and deciding to go either stealth or loud, or even cooking meth, this game is super addicting and amazingly fun to play. One of it's best features is how the randomization of gameplay can either save or screw your hiest. It takes the great features from Payday The Hiest, expands on them, adds new features, and removes the trashy aspects of the original game. There are many differnet varities of missions, and plenty of DLC to add hundreds of extra hours to your gameplay. PAYDAY 2 is an excellent game.  -2016 edit-   Achievement hunting this game is extremely addicting, 10/10 would waste countless hours again",

It's the thrill of getting caught and having to adapt to the situation, deal with the cops, the snipers, the shields, the dozers, the cloakers, everything.  This game has awesome DLC missions and characters, powerful and incredibly engineered music, an amazing community... to be honest I can hardly think of anything missing on this game, aside from Black &amp; Decker quality drills.

The bad thing is that they have a lot of DLC's and if you play enough, at some point you will buy 1 or 2 DLC's and i highly recommend you to buy a dlc on a SALE, like 1$ for a dlc but not at full price at least if you are new in the game.  The worst of all is that after so meny DLC's they wanted more money so what did they do?  They put in the game the well called SAFES that you have to buy DRILLS for 2,20$ (more or less) so you can get SKINS for the weapons and if you are lucky enough you will get a skin for a weapon with a BOOST that will give more Accuracy or things like that.  IF you have company and you can play with your friends it is worth to buy this game, if you are alone think carefully if you are ready to spend money in this game.

I thought it was a worthy purchase and I was somewhat right, but yet for some reason i felt like it wasn't. this game by far is pretty decent but when i saw how much DLC was avalible i was stunned by it. the fact that this game has been going for the past 2 years (or longer depending on how long it continues to go for) is the DLC. Now im not gonna lie, this game its not by ANY means a 'Pay to Win' i can see why people are always thinking that due to the amount of DLC and microtransaction items, but i can honestly say, I've done almost all the heists with no DLC items, perk decks, throwables (grenades, molotovs, etc.), or melee weapons. Now it's true some things feel almost impossible to do without the DLC, but really thats just for achievements. so yes i like this game for the sole purpose that you can do almost anything in it if your skilled enough. But here comes the bad part of my review. I don't like how the game has been thriving. its not really the best thing in the world to thrive on DLC. it works for this game, but in all honesty it just doesn't seem right to thrive on DLC. you got people buying DLC with irl currency, so they can be powerful, more so than other players, take the Yakuza Charactor pack for example. you get all these buffs with low health making you a threat to the A.I in the game. but, not everyone has that DLC and it kinda makes the game unbalenced for other people which i don't like seeing because then its somewhat unfair.  *TL;DR AREA* So in conclusion yes i recommend the game but only if you think its worth your money, but i don't recommend it due to how unbalenced it is for those who don't own DLC.  6.5/10  even if you don't want to buy the game try the demo first to make your final decision please, i don't want my mixed review to make you feel like the game is ♥♥♥♥ because it isn't. its just unbalenced.",

            "review_text": "It's no big secret that Overkill, PAYDAY 2's developers, have made some questionable choices in the past few updates. Between weapons skins and a number of uninspired DLCs a lot has gone down, often for the worse.   But  Beneath the shady marketing gimmicks, beneath every 'Medieval Pack' type DLC, PAYDAY 2 is still a co-op experience nearly unmatched in depth. Every heist of reasonable difficulty requires some level of coordination, be it as simple as providing covering fire for a busy teammate or as complex as assigning specific task to specific players. The combination of skill trees and perk decks leads to a highly customizable experience, while the large number of similar yet ever so slightly different weapons means one still has flexibility within a specific build.   The variety of heists, even in the base game, is impressive, ranging from the sneakest of sneaks, to the shootiest of shootouts, and everything in between. Often the outcome of one day of a heist can and will affect how the second or third day plays out. Much variability to be had.  On the note of DLCs. Personally, I think there are DLCs out there that are very much worth your time, and the uninspired ones that Overkill has garnered a reputation for are surprisingly few and far in between. As I glance at a list of DLC, I find maybe four from over twenty that I would consider truly awful. The rest serve to bring a lot of needed variety into the base game, be it new weapons, characters, or heists. There is the cost, of course, but frankly with Steam sales it essentially becomes a nonissue. I simply waited until a sale, then dropped a ten spot and scooped up all the best DLC for the game and believe me it has made it that much more enjoyable.   So say what you will about PAYDAY 2 being a 'DLC simulator'. Spew as much garbage as you want at Overkill for weapon skins and what not. But at PAYDAY 2's core still lies one of the finest mulitplayer video games on the market. And frankly the DLCs aren't as bad as they're made out to be. Especially when, on sale, a lot of the best ones will run you about a dollar. If you're on the fence about PAYDAY 2, trust me. It's worth your while.   Also there's skydiving. And chicken masks. And is home to the deadliest forklifts in the universe.",

            "review_text": "It's a good game, plenty of fun. The negative reviews are mostly about the company (whatever) and are mainly concerned with the excessive DLC. Good news, there's a solution: Get money. Wait for a sale. Spend $20. Alternatively, you could spend $0 on the DLC and enjoy the core game and its numerous free updates.  Payday 2 is essentially Violent Capture the Flag. Every level involves carrying around loot or objectives and bringing them to a safe spot. Both the stealth and 'loud' flavors of these missions behave as expected, and the game mixes up the objectives enough between rounds to keep the formula from growing stale.  There's a plethora of weapons, masks, and modifications in the vanilla game, but the bulk of them are now behind pay walls. It's not truly an issue, since any level can be approached in a wide variety of ways, and none of them are impossible (or for that matter, any harder) without the DLC. All of the skill trees are available without DLC, though more 'perk' and weapon options are available to purchase.  My biggest gripe is the latency: no matter how great your connection is, there will be lag between what you see and what your teammates are doing. I've shared a network with other players at a LAN party, and there was still 4-5 seconds of lag. It becomes even more pronounced online, where I've experienced up to 15 seconds of latency issues. This is, frankly, unacceptable in a game that depends to heavily on tight cooperation. Stealth missions can easily be ruined because a player wasn't alerted that a guard sensed them until several moments after the fact. Loud missions can turn sour when players aren't told that their teammates have fallen. It's happened more than once.  I'd be remiss if I did not mention the semifrequent crashing. The crashes happen mainly online, when the heist was won or terminated and the game tries to boot up the lobby/menu screen. I have had games crash completely in the middle of playing, but this is rare.  Despite these flaws, I would recommend Payday 2.",

The 'ultraviolence' theme is far too common because stealthers are penalized by being forced to buy DLC for useful concealment ratings and perk-decks. After 100 hours I gave up on the run-and-gun missions because they're repetitive and assaulting police became entirely predictable. Stealths are a-lot more fun because the dynamics are randomized and tactile but meet reasonable expectations. The best part of Payday 2 is the dynamic weapon modding system which gives jobs and weapons new life. I have 5 'Compact-5' submachine guns - each with a unique setup. I have three 'AMR-16' rifles - with modes of fire, optics, and stability / accuracy tweaking. If you DO like going loud, you won't get bored for quite a while.   What I expected in the full version were jobs like the H&amp;T bank, Jewelry store, and that one where you protect the truck full of coke. What I ended up getting were a ton of much larger and occasionally unrealistic jobs which didn't actually contain many of the metrics revealed in demo missions. This upsets me a bit. I got a bunch of missions that i somewhat like, but I didn't really get the jobs or experience I wanted. Examples of what I expected are Shadow Raid, Ukranian Job. What I didn't expect and didn't want was Cook Off, Birth of Sky. Any job which requires adulterance beyond reasonable standards would be handicapping, and Im not the kind of player to lower myself to that level. In that sense, loud missions on very high difficulties are unrealistic, unappealing, and a minigun should NEVER be considered a reasonable default weapon choice.  I'll wait till Overkill decides to make more realistic stealth missions to play once more. Repetition on the missions I love is awful so I've taken to waiting longer to play, because there ARE dozens of better places I could be making kills.",

            "review_text": "After wasting about 450 hours of my life and a certain amount of money into this game, I figured that it probably deserves a near positive comment from a pretentious and nitpicky knob like myself.  It all started about 4 years ago. As i was surfing through the vastness of the Internet, i stumbled upon a review of a game named Payday: The Heist which was about bank robberies, kidnaping and a lot of other stuff those 4 blokes sitting on a huge pile of cash in suits and clown masks with their weapons on display would normally do, and decided to try it out myself. As it turned out a few of my friends were already very much into it which i found funny, considering that i did not find the game amusing to any extent. The gameplay felt akward and repetative, the interface was uncomfortable, the progression was about as straight forward as an intestinal tract and it all generally felt like some wannabe Left 4 Dead with police officers instead of zombies (the music was cool, though). So I was left disapointed with this wasted opportunity.  2 years later however my thoughts on the franchise changed with the release of this time consuming and wallet sucking tw@ Payday 2. It had become superior in many different ways: the heists are more varid, the progression is more clear, actual cash you get off the jobs and plenty of fully customisable guns to spend it on. It was somewhat buggy at release, though. E.g. a few dozen hours into the game all my progress suddenly dropped. I was p*ssed and deleted the game for about a month (thankfully this was patched by the time i gave the game another shot). Another thing is paid DLCs (i understand there's no way around that nowadays but still). Some are decent, some are average, some are complete waste, most of them cost the same and they all feel like a subscriber fee in MMORPGs. And yes, the broke d*ck piece of sh*t drill.  In conclusion i'd like to say that despite all the downsides this game has, it kicks ♥♥♥ a lot, aspecially with a group of friends, skype and a beer. If you don't have this game yet and feeling like spending   a tonn of   some time and money, go out, get it and get some friends to buy it as well, you won't regret it   unless you're a hardcore uber realistic military shooter type in which case i feel sorry for you  .",

Please do not leave a game if someone messes up or if you do mess up. Just dust off your shoulders and try again. You will get it! I find that too many times someone messes up and then just leaves. Please don't be that someone.  Going Loud: I don't have much to say about going loud. I don't find any problems with it.  The weapons: I like that they have a buch of weapons.

I can't think of any other issues of the top of my head right now because i'm rushing to finish this so I can go play some dang PAYDAY. I didn't think I would wright this much.  Conclusion: I would recommend this game to anyone who want's to be a badass heister. Ever heard your parents say to you do what you love? well maybe not but if they do GO be a badass my friend. Don't forget to feed your cat though oh and to study because I have allready failed in life. You know what? PAYDAY is my life so i've succeeded Bain-Senpia.  RATING : 8.5/10",

(no point break but meh.) My friend sent me a message the day I bought it 'Don't play without me, and definitely don't go into a lobby without me.' Sure, that makes sense. I'll just practice in the safehouse a bit.  So I practiced my shot and explored a bit, then I decided to run the easiest job in the game alone, a jewellery store. (Yes Jewellery. Spell it right.) Bain tempted me too much. Easy job! I'll just go in and take it nice and slow.  Casing mode first, I walked around the store. I was going to walk in, but I realized that there'd be a metal detector so I stopped before I walked in.   I wanted to find a back entrance or something similar, to give me a better route to grab the jewellery and run out. Only problem, was there was a security guard! No problem, hid behind a car, masked up, drew the pistol, put one in his head.   Oh wait. ♥♥♥♥.  It doesn't work like that when you don't own a silencer, you idiot.   'Cops are on the way' Well no ♥♥♥♥. I ran into the store, shot a civilian who looked too cop'y that day, then grabbed a bag of jewels and took it to the van.   Only problem is the getaway noped out. So I threw it on the ground to protect it, then ran back in and grabbed two more bags.   Now I've got three bags of jewels, no getaway van, and a bleeding chest. The van showed back up, I tossed the jewels in, and was screaming 'DRIVE YOU DAFT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!' at the screen as Bain informed me the snipers are in position.   You know, you watch videos of this game, and it's all simple and methodical.  Nothing is simple when cops with guns are involved.        10/10 would panic and shoot myself in the foot again.",

I've spent quite a lot of time on this game, it's the only FPS game I don't suck at, it's more fun than CS:GO and it has gone back to rewarding people for the effort they put into the game.

            "review_text": "Payday 2 feels like a very unique shooter, with a large variety of heists and skills etc. I'll cover a few categories:  Gameplay: The gameplay is unique, with a nice feel to the game. Although sometimes the game can feel clunky or lacking in some areas, these problems can be fixed with a few mods. The graphics of the game are nothing spectacular, but they aren't bad by any stretch of the imagination.   Skills/Classes: 'Classes' aren't really a thing in Payday 2, but skills most definitely are. With 5 different skill trees, all with a reasonably large number (don't know the specific number) of skills, the game feels varied with each different skill you pick. You will (mostly) notice a difference in gameplay depending on the skills selected, which leaves room for different types of skill sets and play styles. There are some skills which are clearly 'inferior', per say, but that in no way makes the game unbalanced (unless you pick all of said skills). Occasionally, the developers will come out with some kind of skill or perk that is unbalanced in some way, but they usually fix it quickly enough. Speaking of the developers, let's go on to a more recent and sensitive topic.  Micro transactions: At the beginning of time, when the developers first announced this game, they said it would never have micro transactions. They didn't lie...until recently. They added weapon skins, which are almost only obtainable if purchased (I know, I know - Card drops. But the drop chance for drills is so low, it might as well not exist). To get the weapon skins, you must get safes and drills. The safes are relatively easy to obtain. The drills are the problem, with an insanely low drop rate. If you don't mind the weapon skins existence and you choose to ignore them, then that's NO problem for you. You don't even need to read the rest of this paragraph! But, if you fall to temptation, or get a thrill from opening things that you think 'I'll get lucky this time' and then end up giving you the same skin as the last fifty times you told yourself that, then it can be a bit of a problem. I suffer from the second, and have spent a reasonable sum of money on skins for guns. I haven't ventured down the road of buying legendary skins for hundreds of pounds/dollars, but I have spent large sums. It isn't game changing, but for some it is an annoyance.  DLC: Dear god. Next to micro transactions, this is one of the most annoying things for many in payday. It is LATHERED in DLC. The DLC's aren't 'needed' per say, but they are very very game changing. I have bought most of the DLC's, in an attempt to get better equipment and more varied skill and weapon sets, but I personally dislike the high number of DLC's they have. It's a difficult subject, and for some it ruins the entire outlook on the game, so look into it before you buy.  Story: The game has some sort of jumbled up, hard to follow storyline. But honestly, it isn't even worth paying attention to. That's a personal view, but I feel that the story is so indirect it might as well not be there. That's literally all I have to say about that. Now, for the final paragraph, and my favourite...  Characters: The ****ing payday characters are some of the best characters in games I've played. The dialogue is mostly comedic, and all the characters feel like different people. Whether you want to be Hoxton (OLD, NOT HOUSTON...Damned impostor), an angry British guy who uses swearing like its his second language, or Jacket who speaks through audio recordings or Bonnie, the Scottish female equivalent of Hoxton who has a comedic accent and interesting lines. All of the characters are interesting and fun to play. They make no difference to gameplay, just dialogue, so you can pick your favourite based purely on characteristics.   So, to conclude, Payday is an all round good game about robbing things and killing people and all those fun, illegal things you can't do in real life. Its one of my personal favourites, and I'd recommend it to almost anyone to try.",

Crime.net  is an overly elaborate server list that wastes a lot of time for seemingly no reason. Buying contracts solves a problem that really shouldn't exist to begin with. 2. Game is 100% grind. Grind for skill points, grind for perk points, grind for money, grind for unlocks. What's wrong with just playing the game? Why does everything in modern games have to be about totting up some arbitrary numbers and then pitting those arbitrary numbers against real-time random number generators? Is that our only sense of accomplishment now? These number games have their place in RPGs but have no business in a twitch action shooter/stealth game simulating the things that the player's input should be responsible for. I think I'll just play Left 4 Dead, thanks. 3. Daily jobs with player-selected rewards is a good system that, once again, solves a problem that really shouldn't exist to begin with. The grind exists to artificially extend the length of the game beyond its meagre amounts of actual content. This also serves as an excellent way to incentivize players to pay up for DLC content. You know what we call this model? 'Free to play'. 4. Stealth is boring and often involves sitting around and waiting once all guards and civilians are dealt with. The stealth-only missions are worthless and I only want to avoid them like the plague. 5. Even if you seek out loud missions the game discourages you from playing them too much by inducing a penalty for repeat plays. 6. Mission selection is trash without all DLC packs. Also, all DLC amounts to around $80. How about I just go buy another game with that money, Overkill?  But hey, sometimes it's just fun to play with friends.

For real, everything that could be considered a Microtransaction is completely pointless to the main game. If someone wants to pay for the chance at a skin, then who the hell cares? Let them, that's their money. Microtransactions should only ever been an issue if it impedes or slows progress in the game.  Here's an actual review of the GAME.  From what I can see, the game has gone through several changes since its release, not all of which I like. Older versions of the game did not have the Pager System as prevelent as it is now in stealth missions. The legitimacy of a Pager system on guards that are killed completely silently is in question for me, I don't see it as a good addition, but so be it. Only being able to carry one key card at a time, stupid. Being unable to carry more than a maximum of 6 Cable Ties? Seriously, those things are small. I could carry 100 of them if I tried. Especially with all the guns I pack.  Anyways, I understand the need for game-balancing, but there's better ways to do it.  Overall, I enjoy the Stealth portions of the game MUCH more than any Loud portion. Partially because I play solo or with one friend. Loud missions in high difficulties tend to go wrong pretty quickly when your AI teammates are all but useless. So there's a downside. Stealth provides a proper challenge, but due to the aforementioned issues of carrying capacity, it also unfairly challenges me. I press on anyhow and am satisfied that I can do most of the Stealth-capable Missions solo on DeathWish. Oh, and to hell with DeathWish Loud missions. Like, no. (Note: I have not gotten the supposed meta-Perk deck at this moment).  The game is undoubtably more fun with more people, and I'm hoping to get together more of a group, because going solo does get tedious and loses its fun after awhile. I do think there is an ungodly amount of DLC, but here's the thing, none of it is required. Pick and choose what you want to get or don't get any at all. It's a game, you pay to play. If there's a mission you want to play, yes you have to pay for the mission. Just like you pay for the game. Wait for it to go on sale, Payday 2 goes on sale fairly often compared to most games. The DLCs become real cheap.  Overall, I think if you've read this far into my review: Research the game. Watch it get played on Youtube and make a judgement call. Better with friends.",

The sound in the game is phenominal, as are the visuals, but i have always been a man about gameplay myself and it has tons of that. Mechanics wise it works well as well, although there are a few options in stealth which sometimes make your head scratch, but that is what i am a perfectionist who will repeatedly try the same mission over and over till i reach that blissful perfect score. And in this game until you fully understand the core mechanics you will probably be doing alot of loud heists. That said going in loud is still great fun, watching a head pop is always great, but what truly sets it apart is how you plan, makingor breaking certain missions with the equipment you bring. Surviving a loud DW mission in a suit after stealth breaks with no doctor bags, always gets the adrenaline pumping, and maybe even your budies hating each other when it does fail.Of course the difference can be between firing and not firing, sometimes the latter being the best sloution so you can hold out a little longer and not be instanly gunne down, especially on DW. And speaking of DW, the game definately takes a drastic difficulty spike, compared to overkill and below, but not a bad thing, because it gets the nerves going even more knowing one wrong move can doom your team. So obviously, this is a coop driven game, where singleplayer was never originaly planned, so its not meant as much for singleplayer as bots cannot do objectives, or carry bags, but they do make mighty fine meatshields! Even though its not geared toward singleplayer it is still good even by yourself, and really thats when the learning really takes place, where you can learn your xxx's and ooo's on stealthing, unless you have a good coop buddy to teach you. And OVERKILL has continued supporting this game for quite some time and will be adding even more, so it will continue to expand. From the guns, to masks, this is an all around great game, to the little gems, and videos. To bad they dont have a video archive, where we could go back and watch our favorite intro videos, which are actual continuation of our fabled journey through D.C.

Stealth is usually not an option, so thats also a downside. It does have it's ups, though. Combat feels quite exciting. There's several ways to perform and execute the heist.

You like a select few missions since most of them are garbage? Here, let me put an XP penalty on those ones that you actually do like.  These devlopers are fu(king pathetic. When I first heard of this game and was reading reviews on how this company responded to the community I thought this was gonna be a good game, and have a good team behind it. Now?....now you ask? It's like BF3 and BF4. They start off good (somewhat) then fu(king ruin sh!t as the game pans out.  Game is a waste of fu(king time, if you are a stubborn at attempting to stealth a mission, and keep reseting...reseting...reseting....Game is a waste of money for JOKE DLCs stuff that should be included in game that barely has any real content to begin with!....It's sad when this was actually fun on Xbox 360 too where I was like...a 70-90 rank?   What's worst off, is either new players (which they never got to taste it's original glory) or veterans players in the reviews that MINDLESSLY recommend this game.  I'm seeing sh!t reviews like 'got to fix drills for 17 minutes 10/10'  'best co-op bag throwing simulator 10/10'  I understand these are joke reviews....but don't recommend this garbage game.  Oh well, save your money. Buy a different game that most importantly isn't a waste of your time.   3/8/2015  This game got even worse, now I complete some progress on a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as$ achievement (wanted the scope) on zipline sniping people. Not only is it pathetic you can't ADS. I lost my progress on the achievement.   Also lovely to see enemies walking through walls on Death Wish on Transport Harbor missions, Shows you how bad this Dev team is at making walls that act as walls and don't allow every FBI agent under the sun to walk through it.  Game is still bad, don't buy.   2/25/2016  Why do I have this game still wasting space on my hard drive? I haven't played it since before the microtransactions came to this already garbage game.",

Just want to say this... in points:  + Great atmosphere + Great idea + Great visuals + Great sound design + Great controls + Great potential  - God awful level design that breaks the whole god damn game.  And the non-sensical rules? Sh*t! The game is trying to be real there where it is not supposed to be. Like when choosing a job you actually have to wait for it to pop up on the grid. This wouldn't be a problem if you didn't have to repeat the levels so god damn much! Did the devs ever play it? Every time you start a level the layout changes and sometimes that new layout makes it impossible for you to complete the mission. Like a door goes completely missing to a security room and you can't take hostage the guard who is monitoring the premises. Very often you get a witness that SEES you committing a crime FROM BEHIND A FRICKIN' WALL! Plus don't let the game fool you as to giving you all the freedom in the world. There is no planning in this game because every time you restart the LAYOUT CHANGES so you can't plan. Plus there are practically no blueprints, plans, nothing in nearly ever level. It would be great if you could simply go in and check the place out without your gear so you're not detected before committing the robbery. That would be a game in itself but unfortunatly the game does not give you that option. Whatever stupid wise-guy thought of this thinks too highly of himself. We spent 12 hours on this game, 3 friends and I, NON-STOP trying to give it a chance, not giving up and making it work but I'm sorry to say that it disappointed us. Thanks but no thanks.",

The missions are emmersive and allow for all game styles to make it through. All you need is the core game to play, there are weapon packs, charachter packs, mission packs available to buy. But dont sweat it, I paid for them all and it allows you as a joiner to my server to enjoy the mission you dont have. Weapons a different story but charachters could be randomized. There are little perks here and there like a safe that offers a weapons skin that may or may not boost the stats giving your team a better chance at survival, but you buy the drill for the stat.

            "review_text": " Review  After my friends have bugged me to get this game, I finally did. It is an action-packed multiplayer shooter where you have to complete various heists of different difficulty. It is fun with friends, but that's about it. Joining games with random people is a nightmare because they often ragequit, and the singleplayer is just a fail. On singleplayer, the AI don't do anything to help you, so it's basically just you doing all of the work. Most of the missions are fun, but others are just plain stupid. The mission selection screen seems like the developers thought it would be a good idea to make players wait for missions to randomly popup, but it is not. After you complete each mission, most of the money goes to an 'off-shore account' where you basically can't ever use it except for buying certain things. In my opinion, they should have just not told you most of the money is going to an off-shore account, because it makes players rage when they see how much they actually get. As for buying upgrades, everything in the shop is ridiculously expensive. The game is pretty fun for trying to work together as a team though, and the developers did that pretty well. For most heists, you have to choose whether to stealth it, or go in guns blazing, which is another feature that I really like. Team work and strategy in my opinion are the two things that the developers did really well.  Bugs  I didn't notice very many bugs, but the AI is horrible. Cops just stand there shooting you and rarely go into cover. Same for the AI of your team-mates when you don't have 4 players.  Overall  7.5/10  If you don't have any friends to play this with, I don't reccomend getting it. If you have friends to play with, it is a great game to have fun with friends. The price is way too high for the quality you get. The game does manage to be fun most of the times with friends, which is why I reccomend this and gave it a 7.5 instead of a lower score",

Now we come to what I see today. I see a game that doesn't require teamwork, or skill, or even god forbid the will to finish a heist after a mistake. I see a game where DLC is needed for most average players to even have a chance at beating some of what used to be heists to train on. I see content being rendered obsolete by the constant power creep that you see in many online games. But where most try to balance out everything only the most recent additions seem to matter here.  I cannot recomend this game to anyone at this time. It is not worth the money.  If you must play Payday wait for Payday:The Heist to go on sale.",

But it is a risk I am willing to take. So here we go..  Payday2 is a great First Person Shooter. I prefer to call it a casual game, however it can be taken quiet serious and competitively. I find it most enjoyable with friends however you can still have a really good time just playing by yourself or with other people gloabally on  Crime.net  (Steam)  Now this is were you might be thinking 'Hey that's pretty good.'  Well I have not got onto DLC just yet.  DLC in this game is.. kinda forced/needed to actually play the game. I am not saying you do not need to get DLC however some of the packs are actually good and offer rather a lot of different play styles and weapons. Some of these DLC packs however are really really terrible. As such e.g (John Wick Weapon Pack) It is $4 for me and you basically get nothing. Now like I said this is not forced. But the problem with these packs are is they charge to much to add basically nothing into the game, when they could be adding free content (Which they do add sometimes, however it is mostly always bad.) Which could actually get a lot more people to play. (Not saying there isnt.) But wait.. Who cares about my opinion, it's not like anyone will see this anyway.  Besides that if you can look past DLC, the game is very well made. It has a great community. (before it dies) and I have always enjoyed it personally. Skins. Well.. Are alright they are a nice touch. Safes. Just why. And most maps are fun. Apart from Shadow raid on One down when your friend throws a grenade hoping it will help...  I would recommend this game if you are looking for a casual shooter. But if you were really looking into buying DLC or other types of more content for it. Just wait until a sale.. Trust me it is a lot cheaper.  So I guess that was my review on this game. Nobody will see it. I will get bullied. And now I am going to go and hang myself.

Now this would not have been a problem if not for the promises made by the developers of this game, because if you promise 2x or even 3x the content presented in the finished game you are just ripping off people.  If I had know that the game would turn out like this, I would have never pre-ordered and now they are bringing out DLC, even though it is free for people like me we pre-ordered it feels disgusting that they have basically broken alot of promises that they've made over the course of the beta.  6/10, It isn't a bad game but the developers are just liars who break alot of promises and to me just toke out content to sell as DLC later. Really disappointing to a good game. Don't buy this for future content(you never know if they will keep their promises of updates).",

PROS: +Doesn't deserver the hate is gets, the DLC is just to add to the game. The $5-$7 CAD isn't that bad to pay. If you can't afford that, get a job.  +Great Gameplay  +Stealth and Loud modes, which is a large difference compared to the first one (Which is different compared to the first one, where you actually used to stealth but never could finish a heist in stealth.)  +Different combat ways. my personal favourite (and yes, it's too common besides A: Dodge, and B:Muscle) I use Grinder, which is one of my favourite ways to play, I get good armor and Health Regen by dealing damage, and I love shooting ♥♥♥♥ so it gets better, even with the increased speed compared to the Combined Tactical or others, it's a efficent way to go.  +Alot. Of. ♥♥♥♥ing. Guns. I haven't even purchased ALL the DLC, and I still can't decide which gun to use for a heist. (Although more snipers would be nice. Maybe something like the PSG-1 from BO, in which case is more of a accurate semi-auto, 5 round sniper rifle.)  +Usually about 7K-10K players online. So I guess it could be accounted as a strong going community.  +So much infamy levels, 25, danm, I'm only on 3 xD  +Mod Compatable.   CONS:  - Alot of DLC, but hey, I can get used to it.  - Every now and again, (Which isn't really often) You encounter a Hacker.    -Nearly positive my best friend has been trying to avoid me because of me bugging him about this so much about this game.     OVERALL: 9/10 This game is still one of my favourites, I have even been making a script for a Payday 3 trailer.",

The weapon customization is really big that it offers players a variety of weapons and mods to choose from.

A lot of the DLC heists are really fun to play, such as Hotline Miami, Big Bank, and the Alesso Heist.

            "review_text": "Since I last time I had revised my review, Overkill have changed many things in the past months.  One of the big problems that people felt was 'Pay to Win' was the fact that if you bought into the micro transactions you could get a Stat Boost weapon skin, as the name says it would boost a specific stat for the gun with the skin equipped on it, since then Stat Boosts and Team Boost are both available COMPLETELY FREE from the card drop system and monthly side jobs (I have gotten a ton already) and on the bonus side these stat boosts can be equipped on any weapon, not just the ones that they chose to have a skin.  Now that they have made the stat boosts available for free to all players via card drops and monthly side jobs I hardly feel that the 'Pay to Win' aspect of these skins are there, or should I say a big problem anymore.  As for the absurd amount of DLC the game contains I hardly see any of it is necessary towards an enjoyable time on PAYDAY (Unless you plan to host your own game), since the Rebalance and the addition of a community LMG and Sniper the DLC seem hardly 'Pay to Win' At least for a majority of them, there are some which make the game rather easy (To the point that I don't touch them as I feel they are rather cheap) would be the Sokol Character pack's Grinder Perk deck (Gives you regenerating health for shooting cops).  As for this, I do feel the need to address this tiny detail, the developers in the past have made several promises and never came through on them or released a lack luster version of their promise as well as lied.  Though, the game as a product is really well made, it's extremely fun, has a great soundtrack and gives you reasons to keep playing as it's still being updated and receiving fresh content even after 2 years. I may not like somethings regarding business practices or some of the content that has been released but I would be lying if I told you, I had no fun with this game, as I still play it today.",

Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.  In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.  Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.  Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!  Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.  Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.  Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.  Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).  Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!",

I play it with my friends, I play it by myself, and it has countless replayability. I haven't even finished all the heists yet!!! Now I know there are a lot of people who absolutely hate Overkill because of microtransactions and all of the DLC. All I have to say is I don't think they've really played Payday to it's full potential. As of right now, microtransactions are gone, but when they WERE here, they weren't necessary, even when they gave you a bonus. You can still do the heists stealthy or guns blazing just fine. Now the DLC, that's a whole different story. Yes there are weapon packs. Yes there are heist packs. And yes, there are character packs. But even with these, the game is still very playable and very fun. I didn't own any DLC for 5 months and I still played. Now their are DLC that I recommend getting like some of the weapon packs and a few of the heists, but get them on sale. It's 50 bucks for all the heists alone. I bought almost all the DLC (none of he character packs) for $20 during a small sale. Now that I've gotten all that out of the way, why don't you buy this game, maybe buy it for your friends, and play this game. It is an amazing game it is sure to bring you hours of fun, disappointment, and lots of laughter. But seriously. Can the drills be any worse. I mean come on.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Anyone who says otherwise is either hopping on the hate train, is incompetent at the game, or is at such a low level that the points make a difference (for the 1 hour it takes to level up anyways).  The amount of DLC is pretty ridiculous, but most people seem to forget that you can play any of the missions for FREE. Buying mission DLCs just lets you HOST games. Which seriously does not matter at all (and saves you moniez). The only real reason to buy the DLCs is for masks, guns, and achievements. So wait till a sale, drop 5$ on the weapon DLCs of your choice, and nothing else matters.  I have been playing this game since it was in Beta, and I must say that despite the community's complaints, it is probably one of my all time favourite games. Sure Overkill has their issues, but they don't detract from the overall enjoyment of the game. Just got tired of seeing all these 'OH BOI THEY ♥♥♥♥ED UP WITH MICROTRANSACTIONZ' reviews, or ones about the amount of DLCs.

You can get drills in game, weapons are properly balanced again, and the new skill beta is pretty great. I'm sure many vets would disagree with this (playing since PS3 beta of Payday: The Heist, almost 900 hours in this one on the pc alone), but I think that the problems I had are resolved.

This game is definitely one of the more replayable games on Steam. Plus, this game is on sale like every other week, along with all its DLCs. If you don't have the money, or just don't wanna spend it, you can still play all the heists online, all you're missing out on is some cosmetics and the ability to solo the heist. There's enough Infamy levels to keep you entertained for what seems like forever. At the time I'm writing this, I have 40 hours and I haven't even hit Infamy I. The microtransactions are ENTIRELY optional. If you want, you could just play with standard weapons. I personally don't see any setbacks, except for the fact that you might get a safe when you wanted a mask for a card drop. Plus, it's good to have options, right? Even if you don't want a weapon skin, you still have the ability to buy one. Now, I'm not saying the devs at Overkill couldn't have put in the skins as unlockables, but it's not like they're game breaking or anything. Payday 2 is a great game and I'd definitely reccomend it.  TL;DR: Payday 2 is a good game, and there's a lot more going on in it than money scams.",

Wait for a free weekend where you can try it out if you want.  I played this game quite a bit before the drama that happened sometime last year. It was a fun game with it's issues back then, but I liked it a lot for what it was. I took a break for a while, didn't really follow the scandal very closely at all, still not exactly sure what happened, nor do I care enough to read the details. But I heard they recently fixed a lot of things, added safehouse customisation, and really improved the game.  So I decide to try it again, and of course realise I'm a year behind on DLC. Ok, whatever, not suprising, this game is infamous for the DLC. I start up the game, and get a message about the safehouse. Game immediately crashed. I start it up again. I get into the safehouse this time. Horrible stuttering and the graphics look way worse than I remember. The NPCs mouths don't move when they talk to me in the safehouse. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do, and the game crashes again before I can figure it out.   At this point I find myself wondering why I should even bother relearning all the changes, the new skill trees, new features etc for a game that keeps crashing, that I don't want to buy even more DLC for, and that looks like crap (that last bit is subjective of course but IMO).",

I believe that the microtransactions and the safes are being overreacted to. You can always choose to get the skins, or, you can choose not to. The skins itself aren't great and the nice people down at LastBullet have way better mods for weapons (not sponsored). The stat increases are really dumb in theory and in practice, but only stability and concealment are affected. Overall, this is a game that was good when it came out, better with the addition of useful DLC's like Gage Weapons Pack 1 2 and 3, and has begun to fall given the surge of fun but a bit impractical DLCs like Wild West, BBQ and Chivalry. And oh god the Character Packs! It is not worth it to get them all, I got Dragan because I love the Lion's Roar, is complete beast, and Sokol for Grinder. As I type this the damn 5GB update is still downloading. Prepare your anuses for many more huge updates to come.

            "review_text": "I played the first game (PAYDAY: The Heist), and I LOVED it. I was so excited to finally see PAYDAY 2 announced.  I preordered it along with my cousin and some friends, and we got beta keys and played the beta. It was amazing. New graphics, heists, weapons, all that.  Then it finally came out, all this new stuff was amazing. I didn't really get to play it much until now, which, I can say completely, is very, very, very disappointing.  The game is fun. It always has been. It's challenging and sometimes rage-inducing, but it's a ton of fun. Playing with friends is obviously the best. While there is a good amount of content you get with just buying PAYDAY 2 (not GOTY), I am very deeply disappointed in OVERKILL for doing what they did with this game.  Over half of the content is locked behind a paywall. That means you buy a game for $20 and you get less than half of what you should be getting. They want you to buy DLC for almost everything in the game. From weapons, mods, and heists to masks, colors, materials, and patterns. It's absolutely ridiculous and it's a horrible business model.  Let me put this into perspective.  -You launch up Four Stores as a newbie on Very Hard. Kinda challenging, if you've never played before/don't have much experience. -You complete the heist, grabbing all possible loot, losing 2 of your friends, and having a rage fit because you got downed right before you escaped, leaving your last friend to complete the mission. -You receive your money, earning x amount of dollars. It feels nice to finally get your hard-earned, ill-gotten gains. -You get to the PAYDAY screen, and you pick the left card. The other two cards flip, revealing a mask and a weapon mod. -Your card flips, and it reveals a mask. -You go to your inventory only to find that the mask you just spent 45 minutes getting is only available for you to use IF, and ONLY IF you spend $4.99 more to buy the resperctive DLC pack.  Yeah, that's pretty much how it can go. It's not often, but the number of default unlockable masks compared to DLC masks is staggering. The DLC masks make up at least over half of the unlockable masks. This is the same for weapons and weapon mods. In fact, there are more DLC weapons and weapon mods than there are default. It is so infuriating that I can't find words to express it.  All in all, the game is fun. It's very fun. I would recommend it, yes. But it just barely makes it to that point. The only reason I recommend it is because it still feels like a finished game without DLC. It is extremely annoying to have it thrown in your face all the time, however.  If you hate having massive paywalls and DLC thrown at you every time you boot up the game, skip this and grab 4 copies of PAYDAY: The Heist to play with friends.",

However, the only thing these dlcs really give is more variety. There isn't really a true weapon better than all others, and the dlc's simply add more variety to this. If you are really butthurt over these dlcs, the game has constant sales, and goty edition has the dlc's for ya. All in all, its a fast paced fps, with some strategy, fluent gun play, an extensive modding system, all for a somewhat low price. On sale, you can get goty edition for cheaper than any call of duty or battlefield game, and this is by far a better, more intelligent game. There is recoil, the stats actually matter, and it takes true coop with a group of friends to pull of difficult heists. Then theres stealth. Stalth is pretty cool as well, allowing you to ditch the bloody shoot em up action and take a mch more tactical route, sneaking past cameras, avoiding security gaurds, stealing the loot without anyone batting an eye. I think that its the sheer amount of variety, different methods of doing the same heist, and crazy numbers of mods that keep pulling me back to this excellent game. Those who say that its pay to win don't truly play the game, and I can say that this is a fact.",

Overkill has been sucking money out of the hundreds of thousands of people who play the game, and that is not cool at all. The only way I can actually recommend you buy this, is when it and it's DLC's are on sale, that way you can give them the least amount of money possible. Because they don't deserve it.   However, this isn't a review on Overkill, this is a review on the game Payday 2, so here we go.  Pro's- -4 player Co-op, with friends or with random people -Several perk trees to use, which allow you to play the game in different ways based on preference. -Several perk decks to use which further expand your playstyle, BUT.... you have to pay for a lot of them -Gunplay is fairly decent and there's a wide range of guns to use, BUT... you have to pay for a lot of them -Wide variety of heists to do BUT... you have to pay for a lot of them -An incredible amount of masks you can customize with an obscene amount of patterns, styles, and colors, BUT... you have to pay to get most of these things.  Are you sensing a pattern here? All the pros have cons tacked onto the ♥♥♥-end of them, all because Overkill decides everything has to cost money.  Cons- -You have to pay for alot of the game.  -Dear lord the MICROTRANSACTIONS. I've decided to not talk about them until now, because this is a pretty 'sensitive topic'. Basically, Overkill said they would never put microtransactions in their game. But they did. It wouldn't be an insanely big deal if these were JUST weapon skins, but they ACTUALLY EFFECT YOUR GAMEPLAY. Now, this isn't a game like CS:GO, so you're not going to be using these skins against other players, but come on. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. -Co-op with randoms is difficult. Most people don't know what they're doing, and won't listen to simple commands etc. You're better off finding a group of your friends, or getting lucky and finding a group of randoms you will stick with.  This game doesn't have that many cons, as you can see. The only problem, is the first con is tacked onto almost every pro, and if Overkill just let you buy the game and enjoy it in it's entirety, this would be one of the best games i've ever played. But almost everything costs money, and until you pay, you're not going to be experiencing the full game.  Once again, I RECOMMEND THIS GAME. It's fantastic, and fun with a group of people. But I only advise you buy it when it's on sale as cheap as you can get it.",

More than likely, I will be continuing to play this game for the 18 months they continue to support it.   Though the game is a little glitchy, and does tend to crash a fair amount, which is frustrating, not to mention the net code needs a ton of work. There's way too much desync, and disconnections from other players unless you have a wired connection.   But, all that said, this is one of the best games to play with friends, and a good way to live crime without consequence. This game gets a well deserved 8.5/10.",

On the other hand, stealth missions are not nearly impossible. They are how they are supposed to be. It's easy to learn and hard to master. One thing that you should consider is to having friends who are playing this game. I started playing this game without friends tho. In time it got boring no matter how the community is helpful and nearly no toxic players, no offensive players. I'm playing it with a few friends now and we're like palying for 8-9 hours nonstop.  To finalize, this game's intense gameplay and almost unlimited kind of wepon and wepon mods (as long as you have DLCs) makes it enjoyable all the time. oh and i forgot to tell you guys about all those cool mask and mosk customization option.

            "review_text": "EDIT: It's a so so game. In my opinion, the game has gotten too easy, but I see steps going into making the game at least a little bit more challening.   Here's a few warnings I would like to give yo about this game though:  1. It gets extremely repetitive really fast. Back when the game used to be harder, didn't feel like that too often as it was nice and challening. Now that it's gotten formidably easier, it gets reptitive much faster. I would tell you to play Death Wish, but unless you've got friends to party up with all the time playing Death Wish, and having a good time, will be a rarity. Too many new players in pub lobbies ruin the Death Wish experience.  2. DLC. Don't get caught up in it. Seriously. You'll buy DLC and probably get bored of the game and only play this game once every so often. That birngs to my next point.  3. Buy this game on sale. It's worth 5 bucks. It's not worth any more than that. Not anymore at least. They milk the game with DLC anyway, so it's all good.  4. If you really want DLC, while this is a bit fishy, but I'd recommend a DLC unlocker. Buying DLC is simply not worth it anymore, and DLC does give you a very noticeable advantage once again. Namely the Anarchist perk deck. It marks you as a cheater when using a DLC unlocker, but you won't get banned. There are no consequences besides a few loyal Overkill fans trash talking you in-game, but most people seem to not care anyway.  5. STEALTH IS BROKEN. If you want to stealth either go solo, or go with friends you know that have a good connection. I don't recommend doing it online. This adds to the reptition. Loud heists are pretty much all you'll do, and what you do doesn't vary too much in loud heists, so it gets reptitive even faster.",

Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.  In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.  Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.  Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!  Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.  Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.  Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.  Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).  Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!",

WTF Some civilians/cops wont notice you when they pass you even you wore the mask. - Oh look, a great weapon mod (scope's, barrel's, etc.) darn it.. we need the ***** DLC - Oh man.. 60% inside of the game need the F***** DLC's - Oh look, cool mask.... darn it.. we need DLC - You want RPG? Go get the DLC - You want a bow? Go get the DLC - You want a cool melee? Go get the DLC - EVERY SINGLE WEAPON/MASK/CHARACTER/OTHER SH*T NEED A F**KING DIFFERENT DLC's - Every single DLC's does not realy improve very much. Its boring actualy.  you get the DLC like mask, then what? For showing around with a cool mask? we dont realy need it. you get the DLC like melee, then what? You even not use it on every damn mission. you get the DLC like new weaps, then what? we dont realy use it frequently.  All you need is the weapon mods. And its on the same DLC's you dont realy need it. F*ck it.  Pros: - THIS SH*T HAVE A LOUD OR STEALTH OPTION. - COOL character voice. - An very unfriendly F**KING DRILL. - Baddass music. - Good graphic. - The game system is realy nice. - You can aim without annoying crosshair. - Seriously all you need to hear in the game is the music. - You can choose how you want to escape *on certain mission. - You can multiplay with your friends and blame each other when the alarm goes on.

Houston: *goes down*  Chains: GET THE ♥♥♥♥... ah screw it.  10/10 would inspire fellow heisters in real life   In all seriousness though; Payday 2 is a great game with a great (yet not legal) concept. You and your fellow heisters take whatever the hell you are told to take; whether it be a treasured diamond, to grams upon grams of cocaine. There is almost infinite replayability; with thousands of different builds, weapons, and plans to use/do.   I recommend this game to everyone. But DLC is pretty big in this game, and partially crucial. You are going to be a bit dissappointed, seeing everyone else with their DLC guns and masks. However, if you are okay with the base game gear, you can still play DLC heists as long as the host has the DLC. Find a friend with all of the DLC and you are set. Although a few achievements (if I remember correctly) require DLC which is sad.  Anyways, Payday 2 is an overall great game with plenty to do in it. Also, don't listen to everyone complaining about 'overpriced DLC'. I think it's cool that Overkill is adding new content that WORKS. I'm a 15 year old boy and I'm able to purchase the DLC with my own money. Go help out around your neighborhood or something and mow a lawn, get some change, go to GameStop, get a Steam card and BAM! EASY DLC! ",

As i have seen quite a few reviews say it is only fun when you have people to play with, the game was sugested to my by most of my friends (yes i have friends) so i got the most out of it. Now, DLC. unfortunatly half of the game needs to be payed for again in the form of DLC but at least half of them add decent stuff.

Regardless of bashing the paid DLC, I'm happy that the game keep adding maps and weapons into it I understand that they need money for further development Buying the DLC on discount also the best buck spent for this game   So that's it, I suggest you buy the GOTY edition over the 4-Pack though (unless you have 4 friends), because it comes with DLC Gage weapon pack (which is highly needed) and some DLC heaist",

Read about the introductions of Microtransactions in Payday2 if you want to know more.   This is another good example on a great gameconcept turned sour. You get to play the crook who steals n kills his way to a virtualfortune in coop or solomode.This can be done loud, masks on and guns blazing, or stealthy with sneaky ninja-approach. Its spiced up with skilltrees in a rpg-manner most gamers are used to.  It could be a really good game but theres so many issues its mindboggeling. I really tried to see the good over the bad but its just not possible imho  Pros- Coop. you can play with friends or in publicgames, or with bots if theres noone around  LOOT! who doesnt like the loot from a job well done?  Great gameconcept. Youre the crook who robs n steal n kill cops while listening to progressive electronic music  Difficultylevel is increasing slowly with highest setting being hard enough to make public games a pain   Cons-  P2p connections. Can be really hard to even join a game if host have slow internet. If host leaves, game is shut down and all progress is lost.  Host have supreme power regarding kicking and lot of games ends up with all players but the host being kicked near escape-zone  Cheats. So many players use cheats/hax and it seems theres noone who try to control it. VACbans is nonexisting  DLC-fest. You have to pay 5-7 euro for a cpl of guns, a new character or a heist you can finish in very short time ie 1 heist have a 14sec completionachievement  You have to wait for ages to get a certain hesit available, or pay ingame cash to get it. You cant choose what you want from a list, they spawn randomly. And you need the cash to develop you character. Buying heists will delay the process a lot. Endgame tho doesnt have that issue  Graphics is just below the quality u see in Battlefield2  Community is in rage over the repeated failure of the devs to even act as humans  No Steam-workshop.   No Custommaps.   Superstupid/bugged AI, poor AI pathing.  Mobs have no arms/legs hitboxdetection. You can only shoot them in the torso and head! in a 2013 game..  Only a handful of good official heists.  Did i mention DLC-fest ?? 100 euro so far, or apx twice the basecost of vanillagame. No seasonpass available  Ingame mic doesnt work in most cases or is very low. Imagine that in coop!  Devs not correctin bugs very often. Dont provide whats promised regardin free dlc or Saferoom customization  Paid DLC doesnt offer anything a modder couldnt do.  As of January 2016 devs are still optimizing game for Windows XP and Vista, have downgraded textures  Micro-transaction in a RNG-based lootboxsystem, where the devs repeatedly have promised there would NEVER be any MTs- you now have the option to pay realcash for loot, once one of the pro´s  Devs are in numerous occasions downright lying, have a really bad attitude towrds the community(see link in comments for a sample of it)  250.000$ in pricemoney unlocked by fans during PAYDAYCON has vanished  All in all.. this sux.

I could honestly say I would milk this game Like a cow.... BACK TO MY COMMENTS BEFORE I STARTED crying about crybaby gamers. Ok so... this game is not physics heavy at all which is fine because WHO CARES... this game is fairly good looking and it seems to have a nice menu and skill tree... It is also more in depth than any other FPS crime game I have ever played... ALL IN ALL IT IS FUN. I HAD FUN which is the point of playing games... btw I would like to add that EVERY BAD REVIEW I read had them talking about how many hours they played.... and when I looked at the current time to the time played when they posted thier obvious angry review...

What i love about the game is the fact that it frustrates the absolute hell out of me, but never to the point where i would stop playing (outside of crashes). It just pushes me far enough to make it personal. This is the game, me and my friends always play. The one thing we can always agree on. It has gotten to the point, where most of our in-jokes are a result of this game.  If you are using to playing any other FPS, outside of PAYDAY: The Heist, and you try to act the same here, YOU WILL DIE. There are no two-ways about that fact. The horde of enemies simply do too much damage for you to withstand, even when you build yourself for taking damage. That said, you are getting shot at by dozens of enemies at a time, so no big surprise there.  I am no fan of electronic music, but the music is AWESOME. It fits the mood of the game, and prepares you for when the Police Assault hits (this is the part, where spawns ramp up and EVERYONE comes to wreck your fun.)  If you wanna steal stuff, feel like a badass or you just want to wreak ♥♥♥♥, i recommend.  The combination of the horde and the Special Police Units (similar to a game like Left 4 Dead) constantly tries to shake you lose and are a VERY good source of challenge. Just for a quick summary of the current ones:  Shield: These enemies use (big surprise) Riot shields, that you will need a Sniper, explosives or Incendiaries to bypass. These guys are all about dislodging you from your good position and we have had plenty of times, where they have actively stolen me (either dragging me while downed or picked me up), which has gotten us killed on several occasions.  Snipers: Self explanatory. Little health, higher accuracy and massive damage. Pro tip: if you see the red lazer, just run. It is granted to miss its first shot while you are on the move.  Cloaker: Oh, how many a heist has been foiled by this twit. With only a decent amount of health and poor damage, he doesn't seem to be much of a threat. Then melee happens. He spawns in inconvenient spots, likes to hide and will down you in one hit. It doesn't count towards instant costudy, but they are faster than you and hard to dodge.  Taser: So, let us take a basic cop, give him a gun that compares to higher end police forces, better armoring and then stick him with a taser. He isn't much of a threat OUTSIDE the fact, that he will tase you. It will lock you movement, randomly fire and prevent all actions, outside of looking and shooting. It does have limited range, and if it downs you (only the tasing, not the army of police that will BUTT♥♥♥♥ you during it) won't count towards instant costudy. He will stop a daring stand or escape.  Bulldozer: Comes in many variants, but same applies to most. He is a pain to take down do to high damage and a MASSIVE health pool. The damage is toned done significantly over range, but he will still hit you. Punch through his face plates and take advantage of his massive headshot multiplier. The Deathwish variant (Nicknamed 'Skulldozer') is a little different. He believes in one thing. F*CK your happiness. He doesn't have any more health than the Black Dozer, but doesn't suffer range penalties AND has even more damage. To balance this, he does have a long reload. Not that you will notice.  S.W.A.T. Sentry gun: Okay, i hate this thing. It has WAAAAY too much health, WAAAAY too much armoring to protect its weak spot, it will repair it self (though only 3 times and not replacing its armor plating.) and has WAAAAY too much damage. You can't pierce its armor either, so good luck trying to kill it. It does have a ridiculous headshot multiplier, it will rarely jam and doesnt move after its deployment (and has fixed spawn point like the sniper.), but he is still a ♥♥♥♥.  Captain Winters: He will have a shield Testudo, all of which have increased armor and improved shields. He makes the police tougher and deadlier, he and his men gets stronger as time passes, oh and he will not actively hunt the heisters down. To end the Police Assault he starts, you have to beat him, after that, he just runs off and it is back to business as usual.  If you pick this game up, i hope this information helps.  See you in the field. ",

It's best to purchase this if you have a squad of friends who are down to stealth some banks or even blow stuff up with.

'Maxwell' was sent to custody followed by 'Alex', 20 seconds later, I was sent to Custody and we failed the mission. (On purpose that is) We went to restart the mission and then............ My Payday 2 for PC crashed without warning. I was not happy with this outcome, therefore, I do not reccomend this title.",

Feels like the same engine, and heaven forbid you don't have the energy or the internet to group up the single player A.I. for the teammates is laughable. Along with the enemy A.I. which simply rush you like wave after wave of zombie horde from L4D2, which much of the textures and levels from this game seem to have come from. As well as the gameplay goals. To be completely honest I HATE CO-OP games, playing with other ppl always leaves me feeling rushed and unhappy with content.  -No real tutorial that explains how to accomplish what is required to complete levels, watching a drill for five minutes so you can restart it three times in a 'safe-house' doesn't really cover the bases for this kind of game imo. -The only objective of the game seems to be 'fill this vault with cash by doing random scenarios with seemingly no connection to any other event in the game.' -the DLC content i purchased can't be used until i earn enough $ by doing these scenarios that bore me to tears or again a scenario that relies on either idiot computer A.I. or idiot internet troll  Only game in my Steam library I uninstalled and would LOVE a refund for.  EDIT: 11-15-14. Was looking at some of the screen shots on the steam store and had to guffaw at how one of the levels is LITERALLY the Bank level from CS:GO. Regurgitation is gross, even in video games. Now even less impressed.",

There is extra content that if you Want it you can BUY it but it is NOT required to enjoy a majority of the game.  This game is fantastic especially if you will have some friends to play it with. At first glance you would assume its just another first person shooter when in reality it actually has an amazing amount of depth to the gameplay, tons of customization and the game is extreamly immersive, and tons of way to customize not only your charactor but your weapons as well.    Now onto the detail of what you will experience. So the game is a VERY fun party game. Every single mission can be completed in multiple ways. If you like stealth, and being very tactical, then just build your guy for it and boom you can be a ninja If you like to go in guns blazin, then you can give yourself heavy armor and heavy weapons and make some swiss cheese. All in all its one of the funnest games I have played in a very long time and I see myself continuing to play it as they release new content which is VERY often, at least once a month from what im seeing.   So whether you like to play solo, or play with friends, I highly recommend this game 9/10",

However once again, if you can weather the storm. Find some good people like I did, get them on your friends list. You can have tons of fun. Whether you win or lose the hesit.   I find myself checking the recent players list too often to see if it is indeed a cheater/hack that has entered my game.  That being said its still fun to me, I still love it, and I won't let cheaters beat me down to where i don't enjoy. Fact is there are more fun people to find and play with then there are cheaters.

Bought all the DLC. Found people in my own nation, taught them how to play.  It's a endless money pit. The developers release a DLC, you want to buy it because your crew buying it, your friends buying it, your 12 year-old neighbor buying it, so you bought it but then, what is this ? A new DLC! Oh boy, oh boy! MAMA! GIMME YOUR CREDIT CARD!  I have no comment on P2W thing, it's a Co-op game, players against NPCs. A creep paid around 1500$ to this game, who cares.

Go ahead, hate me all you want you and see where it gets you in life. Just because I like what Overkill is doing doesn't mean anything. You have to remember that Overkill is a small company, they can't do everything immediatlely. They've put countless hours into this game, and you should all be thankful that this game is still around, otherwise, you'd all be stuck with the annoyance of CS:GO's case openings. Other than that, Overkill, don't listen to the haters. Do what needs to be done and do it the way you think it should be done.

Bad things of Payday 2: -AI is a little funky at times. (Even the friendly bots on offline mode) -Don't expect on playing random pubs and having smooth experiences with other players. -Loads a DLC.

PAYDAY 2 is a 4 player multiplayer co-op First Person Shooter which puts you in the shoes of a career criminal doing everything from robbing convieniance stores and banks to breaking your old crew member out of jail and killing his traitor and more!  This game is not the prettiest looking game out there, but it is rich with content and is very light on your system, especially with the 'Lower Shadow Map' mod made by fans of the game, with this I can run at 30 FPS on a low end laptop from wal mart with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Intel HD Graphics Chip. So most PCs should be able to play this. And once you do, you are in for a wild ride.  The base game sports TONS of hiests with a handful of Heists available as DLC. Each heist is unique in it's own way and they run the gambit from being short, quick runs to long treks through tons of bullets, cops and explosions.  This game is co-op but can be played single-player. Honestly, if you want the best experience, get 3 friends together and go heisting! But online is really the only way to get a solid experience in this game.  This game is not without it's flaws however, there are glitches and bugs that appear after every update, but in my experience it's never really broken (But this is something you have to see and deal with on a patch-by-patch basis)  Is PAYDAY 2 worht your money? Yes, yes it is. with the abundance of unique heists and great co-op experience mixed with varied gameplay makes this game more than worth playing especially if you have friends to play it with. I have nearly 500 hours in this game to show just how addictive this game can be.",

Personally, I like the change, even if I'll never pay to open a crate. What I find funny is everyone's crying 'Pay to win! Pay to win!' Well they seem to forget Grenades aren't a part of the base game. AS FOR A REVIEW!!  I've dumped countless hundreds of hours into this game, it's got bugs that annoy the hell out of me, a fair few of which I'm assuming relate back to the netcode but, for the most part, it's a great game plagued by a toxic community, which sadly Overkill feels it needs to bend to the whims of. It has so many aspects that it doesn't need (the likes of LMGs for example, which until recently have been ignored.) There's alot of DLC that is often sold for cheap, which actually adds to the gameplay. The game fills a nieche that doesn't have much going for it. A heist simulator that borders on the archaic, seeing as banks are no longer the priority.",

But anyway  I wanna start this off saying: I like PAYDAY 2 probably one of my favorite games, good guns, heisters are fun, easy to hop into, easily moddable, I would recommend this to a friend instantly.  Now with the current situation with the skins n stuff Personally I like the skins they look cool. So it boggles me how people are complaining on something they don't HAVE to get. BUT TONY THEY ADD STATS! Yes that was kind of a stupid idea on Overkill's part but I still stand by my point you do not need to get the skins, yeah the stats are probably nice but not needed. Is that 2 stability really gonna help?  Everyone is complaining the crimefest reward wasnt't free, I think they're forgetting about the weapon rebalance BUT TONY THEY BROKE SHOTGUNS From my knowledge the damage is counted by pellet now.  All in all everyone giving a horrible review on a game they clocked hours and hours on is just silly They have heard our outcry no need to ruin Payday 2 it's just mean at that point  But thats my overall thoughts on the game and current situation at hand pls dont burn me people who are boycotting 9/10        ",

It has some amazing stuff and most of the dlc is fair and fine. Overkill (the developers) are very community based and release free stuff to. They do lots of community activities and really like the fans. They really listen to the community. The reason people are unhappy right now are because they added microtransactions for weapon skins only really badly. I was unhappy about this to.

A co-operative FPS, the heists you and the online players can run range from simple ones that last for only a little over a minute at best to giant, cinematic half-hour to hour-long epics. The gameplay isn't the most innovative or (especially) balanced, but it performs capably in doing what it's supposed to. What makes it good is the variety of difficulty levels and stages-so if you want a massive challenge or a simple, easy action, you can easily get both. That's the good part.  The bad part is that the game is indeed 'overbuilt' for lack of a better word. The developers have loaded tons of DLC packs, additional weapons, and (most recently-not to mention controversially) microtransactions into the game. None of this is directly needed to play the game, but it still exists with hordes of extra (often unbalanced) content stuffed on top of the simple gameplay base. Always research and see if you really want it before you buy any additional DLC.  However, being overbuilt does not change the basic quality of the game itself. Not the most advanced or balanced game, but still quite good.",

Personally, I enjoy the game, its gameplay is really addictive, super fun, and once you learn the ropes, easy to get the hang of. If you're looking for a casual 4-player co-op shooter to play with friends, pick this one up on sale, as there's a LOT of DLC that really enhances the gameplay, giving much more variety than what you'd have with vanilla. Definitely pick up the GOTY edition if you're buying though. Payday 2 is also getting supported until 2017, so it's lifespan still has another year and a half or so on it.

For most players, they would do this only when they're performing their heists stealthy. But do keep in check that your crew members understands the plan or everything's gonna screw up. Payday 2 also has variety of weapons ranging from rocket lauchers to miniguns to flamethrowers to take down your foes such as swat soldiers, swat trucks(a metal truck with a full-auto sentry gun mounted on top),Bulldozers(heavy swat gunner), tasers, cloakers(swat ninjas that ambush you from an unexpected corner), snipers and shields. Payday 2's main attraction is the ability to customize your arsenal, you can make your own masks, put random attachments to your gun which does effects its status, and apply different skins to your gun. The game also features amazing soundtracks, seriously, they did a good job at the soundtracks. The graphics are sharp and vivid, playing this game with the VR will totally make you crap your pants. So yeah, I really recommend this game to you guys who are seeking for new games to play, so go check this game out. ",

I've only obtained the game recently at 75% discount (it was on my radar for some time already but wouldn't spend 20 bucks for the bare game) so I can't compare with pre-Crimefest days.  Anyway, I've spent about 15 hours now and am still happy with the purchase. Single Player is nice for tutorial purposes and learning the levels, but not to experience the real game. The fact that you can't give orders to the computer A.I. in your team and that they won't carry bags, make some levels (Slaughterhouse) rather unplayable in single player.  Online mode however fixes those issues. Maybe it's a way the devs want people to play online instead of offline. Sometimes you get kicked for no reason within 2 seconds after joining, but most of the times it has been a pleasant experience. First time playing and finishing the Slaughterhouse was very rewarding. Quite another level than the Jewelry store.   So would I advise to but this game? Sure, but I would wait for a discount (such as the current Steam Autumn Sale) as you can get the game + DLC's for €11,49 instead of €19,99 for the bare game. ",

Also the Charackters are great they have such good voices they just are PERFECT. My favourite Charachters are Housten and Clover :3. So now i come to the bad things about Payday, first of all the DLC they are just TO MUCH. I own every DLC but, you have to buy it on sales because, you pay for one DLC 5,00 € and its to expensive because, there are over 30 DLCs i guess so OVERKILL TAKE MY MONEY. So now i come to the worst part of the game. THE ♥♥♥♥ING CS:GO System with the ♥♥♥♥ing Cases and LUCK. So i already dont liked the system in CS:GO so why Overkill did you guessed it would be such a great Idea to fake these System and just make DRILLS AND SAFES. You pay 2,00 euros for one Drill but, you also can find it in the game but they are pretty rare. At least i found 1 so yeah. Also not to forget the skins boost your weapons but its okay you also can modify a normal weapon with the same mods the only thing here you have to find the modifications but thats also no problem. So would i recommend these game, yeah of course but dont assist the Skins system with buying these drills. You can buy the DLC but, if i were you just wait until a Sale.",

But this game has been out for a while and since it has been on steam for so long that means when it goes on sale it is really cheap, so how is the company going to make money, well it seems like microtransactions are the only way.

However, it may come as a shock to you that not only have we been tricked, but we've been tricked by one of the few masters of the trade! Our Jimmbos and John Does have been disrupted by one of the few remaining tricksters from the greatest age of rustlers known to humankind! We appear to be more that just tricked, disoriented, bamboozled, or even hornswaggled. Yes my friends, it's becoming clear to me now. We have been RUSED! That's right. We, lowly heisters, have been rused by a trickster unlike any other. You see, his trickery goes back deeper than we can imagine. Long before the age of technology, long before the discovery of the practical applications of electricity, there existed a group of men. A group so ancient and powerful, that any jimmerinos that were unlucky enough to come in contact with it were guaranteed to face mighty oppositions. Just as many before have fallen, we too have become a pawn in a large game of tricky chess! How gullible, how innocent, how unsuspecting we must have been, to be swamped with such oh so tricky and devious plans? If you have not yet guessed who he is, allow me to explain a bit more to you about how undeniably scammed we are! You see, he is part of a higher power. He is a member of the Overkill, and he has been a member of the Overkill for several years. This would explain our painful and embarassing situation! You see, we have fallen right into his trap. Years of planning, decades of constant training, have allowed him to trick us to this astounding degree. Even the gods have fallen to his trickery. And we, my friends, hold no immunity. We have been given the sour apple out of the bunch. The short end of the deal belongs to us. Maybe we shall ver, maybe we will not. All that I know is a fact is that we, yes WE... have been RUSED by one of the few... one of the powerful... one of the trickiest tricksters of all...  AND HE, ALMIR LISTO, HOLDS NO REMORSE OR REGRET FOR HE IS AND ALWAYS SHALL BE A MASTER RUSEMAN!",

In it, you play from an assortment of characters who on their own have no special capabilities, but by running heists, you earn experience and levels to assign points to various skill trees to flesh out your abilities. The recent updates have rebalanced the weapon sets so that many of them are much more viable than before, and the game continues to receive new heists and equipment as time goes by.  The game has recently come under fire from a vocal group who have mistaken pre-release rumor squashing from two plus years ago as ironclad resolutions (one from a man who no longer works for the company) to prevent a business model from being implemented in a game they enjoy.   What has happened is the game has received something similar to the Mannconomy Update from TF2, where safes can drop after the completion of a heist, and require the use of a key that costs $2.50 to open. The safes, like the crates in TF2, are entirely optional, and offer weapon skins that give minor statistical benefits at worst, and emulate common mod-loadouts while excluding the use of the same mods at best.   Do not let these reviews dissuade you from trying an actually enjoyable game! Just be aware that these are people who, should you join their lobby with one of these weapon skins equipped (as the game shows your character with their chosen mask and any weapon skins when you join), they will kick you to prevent you from playing with them.",

So lets come to a Point ! DO I RECOMMEND THE GAME ? There is ONLY 1 Answer for me ; YES I DO. It is a really nice game and if you have any friends to play with it gets even better. The Variaty of Guns you have with the DLCs is Amazing and every Heist is different in itself I really like it. I will continue plaing the game until I have a number of Hours Steam cant display anymore.   Just as a small hint every DLC exepct the latest one is going on Sale every Steam Sale and drops to about 1 € and that is really a acceptable price for a new heist and or Weapons.",

The perks system allows even further customization, and Overkill's development team regularly updates the game with bug fixes, new weapons, heists, and here's the only bad point; often trries to please an inherently unpleasable community. The game also has an admittedly, somewhatt dark sense of humor at times, which far to many game developers could learn from, just for how much it helps to set the atmosphere, of what really comes down to you and your buddies planning a heist together.  That said, there is currently a vocal handful of idiots kicking people from the game, simply if they've received drops from heists in game that might potentially end up sold on the steam community market. They are currently engaged in a campaign specifically to *do everything theey can* to sink this game's ratings in the toilet, *specifically* so you don't see how good of a game it really is.   No matter wwhat a handful of the community says, it won't change the fact that until this group of idiots got together, that Metacritic itself gave this game a 96 out of 100 that lasted almost 4 years, and the score has only dropped due to the actions of people who are specifically *trying* to tank it in retaliation for anything Overkill does, period.

The heists are rather varied, ranging from simple bank jobs to more elaborate 'break into museums and steal artifacts' and 'bust some heads while looting a casino'. One issue some may find with this, however, is quite a few of the bigger heists are locked behind DLC. It's rather cheap DLC, however, and when they go on sale, they're dirt cheap. It's worth a wait for most of them.  It's a game worth taking a swing at, really. It's a lot of fun, even when you're playing by yourself.",

Seriously, one of the best I've played. So much so I decided since it was christmas day, and the sales are on I might aswell buy it for £5. Worst decision I've made thus far- now please don't let this review give the content of the game any dishonour. The content of the game is fantastic, I'd even say so If I was actually able to play.  I checked the system requirements to see if I could run the game, and my specs were better than the recommended requirements so I thought it'd be fine. I'll admit, I expected that I would need to turn the graphics quality down a considerable amount (maybe to medium or so).   So I finally got the game, and what do you know? Lag, alot of it too. I go to the options to turn down the qaulity and to my supprise, there is limited options to actually do anything. I'm serious, it's very limited. But never the less, I turn my game down to 1280x720, everything on low and all the shaders and effects to off. Restart the game and it's still unplayable. Immediate uninstall. I'm sad to see that I've spent £5 on a game I won't actually be able to play. I was very excitied to play this fantastic game on christmas but I'm deeply saddaned.  I'll reccomend this game purely for its content, if you're looking at spec wise and running a lowish computer- stay away.",

And the infamy system for late gamers taking ideas from Call of Duty, was a great idea as well. They took that from CoD, and made it so much better.  There are some problems with this game however. The first being the ♥♥♥♥ tons of DLC. Smells like EA up in here. Secondly, the glitches and connectivity problems.

I experimented that so i played 30 minutes for nothing... -multiplayer selection of games is ridiculous: you can't choose the job you want unless you pay a fortune (in death wish) -lots of connexion issues: can't join games &gt; 50% of time for no reason -lists of lobbies is wrong: a finished job is labelled like it's gonna start so you join and do something else at the end! -noobs can join any game because the minimum level selection settings doesnt allow infamous discrimination (you should not be able to join a dw game if you have not completed the same job in very hard for example...) -on some jobs, opening vault is ridiculously long even in stealth without any way to loose (all civilians tied/killed). A 2x fast forward option would be nice...  The ugly: -lots of game crashes (it seems that installing hoxhud to have missing esential features seems to worsen that issue) -to be able to host games on all maps you must buy lots of DLC... -it's kind of a zombi-killer game because cops are so stupid... -AI is ridiculously stupid (cops, bots and converted cops) -no dedicated servers so you rely on host. You can be disconnected at 99% of a job for no reason and gain nothing out of 1/2 hour of play (multiple days job) -with dedicated servers the server could verify actions and kick cheating players. When cheaters host games they can do a day job in less than 10s without even moving from start point... -many cheaters that are V-100 but are just noobs when trying to play 'for real'. -ends up highly repetitive because many jobs are just a variant of other jobs",

The fun doesn't stop there, work for Russians, steal drugs and more! The possibilities are certainly not countless, but feel free to repeat every mission a couple of times.  The first part of this review might sound negative, and sarcastic, but the game is actually a ton of fun. The gameplay stays fresh even though you play the game a lot. Level up until 100, and then do it 5 times over as you rank through the 'Infamous' titles. The gameplay offers both stealth mechanics and 'Guns Blazing' options, increase the difficulty if you don't feel challenged.  Overall, a great game. 7/10",

Still worth it if you just wanna shoot it out with THE MAN.  Outside of gameplay... I have a love/hate thing for the Mystery Card after a succesful heist. I like that you get a random... thing, but I hate how it is the only way to get weapon/mask mods. Also, I don't like that the mods are weapon specific. If you unlock a new sight, you unlock it for a certain weapon you already have access to. It may or may not be a weapon you have bought.  Overall, I love it. Good mix of True Heist, and Botched Heist(Shootout) Most jobs can be done with no cops, but there are plenty that require heavy armor and hard-hitting weapons. The gameplay is very balanced between the difficulty levels. The job never changes, just the complexity of it. Number of guards, cameras, civillians, wandering civillians, etc.  If you're on the fence about it, fall on the 'YES' side!",

They will walk right by a SWAT team member as if he's on your side robbing the bank as well and proceeds to walk into the corner presumably to cry about his life's mistakes. Anyways the only time the friendly AI is bearable is on the short 1 day heists and not on any heist thay takes more than 2 days to complete. With all this being said, I recommend this for fans of the RPG genre and who like the FPS genre with a little twist.  9/10",

While the basic premise is very simple (steal things, shoot cops, repeat), the mechanics of the leveling system as well as the levels themselves keep the game interesting and rewarding. The large number of heists ensures you'll never have to do the same one twice, and the shear variety and imagination of the settings keeps you on your toes.  This game combines an relatively simple leveling system with a complex and varied set of upgrades that allows for vast amounts of character personalization and customization. 4 different skill trees and 6(recently 7) perk decks give ample tools to create the perfect cat burglar, a run and gun John Dillinger of a heister, or a heavily armored enforcer.  Complimenting the leveling is the well designed gun customization system. While relatively simple to use and understand, the amount of different guns and modifications allows for even the pickiest player to create their own perfect firearm for heisting. All the customization is used as well, with different heists requiring careful management of loadout to execute efficently.  Possibly the best part about Payday 2 is the support it recieves from it's developers, Overkill software. This is a game you can expect to continue updating, advancing, and providing new content for the next 2 years, according Overkill's own statement. Bugs are constantly being fixed, features are being added, and new DLC is almost a monthly expectation. All in all, after 500 hours into the game, I can easily say I'm still learning new things within this game. If you enjoy a little mayhem, I can't think of a better game for you. Heist on.",

Also, the AI cannot carry or support a heist. They only handle combat. So, any harder missions are not possible with AI partners. It boils down to only having 3 missions you can play. Also, it gets very repetitive. Fighting unlimited cops isn't as fun as you would think.   It's like Left for dead's hordes, except they all have the ability to shoot you....

But making all the Snipers, All the shotguns, All grenades, All specials DLC is just lame. Not to pricey though. Thats not why Im thumbs downing this game. I could deal with DLC and would even buy. But my main concern with the game is the skill tree. Its completely lack luster too me. Most the skills for all characters just arent appetizing. And really arent effective. Especially for the time and money you spend on them. Example: the Enforcer has skill that improves carrying speed for bags. One of the few skills I actually Wanted. Got it fully upgraded.

All of which are leading up to a hinted 'grand' heist to go in the books as the greatest heist ever performed.  That's the game I wanted, instead, I got an incomplete game. 13 patches later, and I'm still not pleased with the Payday 2 I got. With a promised 30 heists, which we don't have yet. The mask system is great, and the weapon system kinda went down the drain with numbers. So, untill this game is fully complete, my review is on hold.

It's a blast to play as long as your not some wussy gamer that can't play on a harder games mode than normal. The game is about the challenge and that no two heists are EVER the same. Plus some heist take more than one day to play. I came into this game as someone who loves the stealth action games and restarts every time I make a small mistake... You cannot do that in this game. Even if you were playing solo to start with you lake any skills that would make soloing a heist very successful. It's meant to be played with a team of friends and be challenged to complete something you started, seeing it though to the very bitter end...",

It's fun and addicting. An FPS with RPG elements? (Or vise versa) YES PLEASE! No need to be witty or clever when half the steam users apply that to their own reviews. It's a load of fun. Sure, it's a pain in between my testicles to constantly pick up bags or repair drills, but the effort you put in shines at the end of every pay day. That gratifying sensation you get every time that EXP stacks higher and higher gets even better when you level up sporadically throughout the game. Almost every heist is intriguing in some way, and there's plenty of replay value. You can choose to go loud or stealth some missions, or the the complete opposite next time. The soundtrack also brings joy to my dainty ear drums. Stealth music brings perfect ambience to the table and the Assault themes are filled with a brim of that electronic goodness. What takes a toll in my ears however, are the damn callouts.  'GET DOWN ON THE GROUND' 'GET THE ♥♥♥♥ UP' 'STAY DOWN' 'HOXTON, FOLLOW ME' 'DALLAS, OVER HERE' 'OH ♥♥♥♥, CLOAKER!' '♥♥♥♥!' 'KEEP DRILLING YOU PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥!'   At least, every character has their own unique personality traits, and some of the dialogue makes me outright burst out in laughter. Overall, the game's good. Trust me. 8.5/10? Maybe even a 9. Go buy it. Ask ur mum, get a job, beg your friends, cook some meth, rob a bank, disrupt transports, destroy democracy. It's worth.",

Not a game one should expect to jump right into, missions offer require scouting out the location, locating guards, cameras, and most importantly valuable merchandise. This is also a game I would not recommend playing solo soley because its so much better playing with your friends. Also the AI is ruthless and unforgiving and will hand you your ♥♥♥ in a handbasket...except theres no little goodies and it smells of cheese. My only problems with the game dont derive from the gameplay thank goodness, Money is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get in this game since the large sum of your money goes into an offshore account (respectively makes sense since I assume all this money is being wired, and if it was being wired to your person's personal account, the fuzz would pick up on all the HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of dollars in your account.) Second problem is the system for unlocking attachments for your guns, which are first unlocked randomly through a 'pick a random card' system at the end of every heist. This can get extreamly annoying (I have yet to experience this on PC though) when you just completed a 3 day job, and you pick a card, you see the gun attechment card pop up as the card you picked, you sit up in excitment waiting for your new attachment. Maybe it will be a new optic for your sniper rifle, or a better stock that increases the concealability of your assault rifle...or maybe it could be a tactical light...and you could already have 4 more of them because you never ever need them and they serve no purpose.  Im not entirely sure if this is a problem on PC, since it was very bad on 360, but you can still unlock attachments for guns you dont own. But other than those 2 things, which arent really that big of a deal when you have an established loadout and are at a pretty decent level, Payday2 is a must have for any group of friends who love playing Coop games.  -I give this game a 9/10",

Community is great at working together, when you find a team of players willing to use their skillsets to maximum you can easily tell how much easier a heist is then running and gunning and hoping for the best. I was originally off put because while I liked payday 1 it did not feel immersive enough. This game takes this feeling and busts a 180 from mask customization, to custom guns, and skillsets. It feels almost like a fps-rpg hybrid as you feel missions become easier as you progress and unlock more perks. All in all great game, even if not serious player to just pick and run a few heists before heading off to work. 9/10",

In multiplayer with friend is certainly the most intence game i played, the stress and the immersion are pretty damn good.

You can go from the classic bank heist to cooking meth to robbing a bus filled with c4 explosives. You even have different approaches to the levels like stealthing through them, or go in guns blazing. You can customize your heister with different mask (colors, patterns, etc.), weapons, and even abilities such as the ability to revive your teamates by shouting at them (no joke)  Pros: -Good FPS mechanics -Customize the way you want to play -Variation between the heists  Cons: -Outdated graphics -Majority of the community hates noobs (they will kick you if you're under lvl 50 and yell at you cause you do not know how to do the heist the 'right' way)  Final Thoughts:  If you plan on getting the game, I recomend you get the four pack and give a copy to 3 of your friends. That way you can enjoy the heists as you learn how to play them.",

For me, I loved Payday the Heist; it brought those Hollywood Heist movie elements from some of my favorite heist movies (Heat, Point Break, etc), however i thought that while the missions seemed very dynamic and posed their own challenges; the amount and replayability was rather limited. They were good and epic missions, but there wernt that many and missions hardly varied in circumstance. With Payday 2, i think they alleviated some of that monotonous rinse and repeat feel of the original game's missions with their wide variety of missions. and while some of these seem a bit shallow, they definately keep that fresh feel. However, the friendly AI seems to have been SEVERLY weakened since the first game; AI teammates hardly acknowledge Special units, seem almost near obsolete on difficulties higher than Hard with their mediocre choice of weapons and constantly reloading after firing only a few rounds. The problem with the AI seems mainly with their ability to fight specials, they will only fire maybe an average of 6 rounds before reloading and ignoring specials. They will literally run right past cloakers kicking a downed teammate to help them, only to get knocked down themselves by the SAME cloaker, rinse and repeat for any other assisting AI. Overall i think its a pretty good game, despite the problems,",

        {
            "review_text": "Rating: 7/10  Payday 2 is a multi-player FPS developed by Overkill studios. The basic premise is to plan and pull off heists on banks, jewlery stores and other high value targets. There is no story, per-se, though some heists are 'multi-day' and so therefore have a story within them. There are little bits of background lore from the first game that are expanded on a little as well, but you can know nothing about Payday 1 and still have a clear idea of what is going on.  The game has a heavy focus on customisation, both on the players look and the guns they carry. The player has a mask, which can be customised through patterns, colours and markings, which acts as the main way in which you'll recognise them in the field and menus. The customisation is frankly ill-thought out, the achievement masks have defined ways of unlocking them, but the only other way to unlock masks is by luck through a random system at the end of each heist, which can give you a range of things, many of which are not related to customising the mask. This results in you feeling as though you COULD have a great representation of yourself in the game, but are restricted by the luck system within it. Gun parts are also unlocked in this fashion, but each has it's balancing elements, so it's better thought out and feels deeper than the mask system. Finding just the right combination of parts for your guns is rewarding and satisfying.  Once you're actually into a heist, you'll want to be with friends. The bots in single-player are either a) useless or b) bullet sponges and while the second can be really useful on bank heists, it means you have no way to do higher difficulties without going multi-player. This may not appeal to everyone, but good planning is required on Overkill and Death Wish difficulties. The game rewards good management, but can also punish small mistakes very harshly even on Normal difficulty. It has a steep learning curve, in short, which again may not appeal to everyone. Sometimes police turn psychic as well, which is infuriating. Stealth missions are either really fun (if you're a Ghost) or boring (if you're everyone else). Higher level cops also seem to take a ridiculous amount of firepower to kill, and while this fits with the difficulty of the game, it makes it very frustrating on occasion.  After completing a job using various tools of the trade (drills, emp's etc) you'll be able to assign experience to skills. This is where the game probably shines the brightest. The skill trees all compliment eachother very well, with powerful abilities in the top tier making the difference on higher difficulties, but combining lower tier abilities from each class also works for many heists. A stealthy Ghost can really benefit from the tough Enforcers ability to carry loot faster, for example, and these lower tier traits come into their own during early games, just as the higher tier ones will for later games. This is the mark of a good, well thought out skill system, and it's the games best feature.  The characters voices get really annoying after a while. Bain in particular will make you want to strangle him after a few missions of explaining that a 'big bank is a still a bank' in a crackled voice. Similarly later skills will have you shouting at eachother or civilians and will repeat the same line of dialogue, breaking the atmosphere of the game and hurting the experience. The guns sound a little 'meh' as well, with even the biggest loudest guns not really feeling particularly beefy or loud when you use them.  There is a massive amount of DLC for the game as well, mostly consisting of weapons and missions, and all of it adds something a little different. They're not too heavily priced, so it's worth getting a few and maybe adding more during sales, particularly the Courier Pack and the Armoured Transport pack.  Eventually though, even with this DLC, there's not much to keep you coming back apart from wanting to get the next gun or skill. There's no narrative or character depth, so it's entirely up to you to set the objective for the next few games. If you, like I have, find that there isn't really anything more you want from the skill tree or any more guns, then you'll stop playing, because you will, by that point, likely have played the same heists about 20 times over. There isn't a massive amount of variety, the DLC's help with this to some degree but not massively, and it is fun for a while, but only with friends and only before it starts feeling like it's frustrating to play again.  Overall, it's solid and well made and while it has it's faults I would certainly recommend it. It's not a Grade A shooter, but it's certainly a B and as long as your happy with repetition of the same mission you can get by.",

Would you rather have Payday 12 by now, instead of constant support and fresh content?  Would you like to pay a full game price for every bit of change to the game?  If this game were published by EA, we would have Payday 4 -atleast- by now. Instead: - they dont't divide the playerbase -they keep refining core elements -they come up with fresh content , which is mostly free for all , just the new guns and ♥♥♥♥ cost money.  You can and will always be able to jump into those new heists, which only cost for the person who decides to pay for it and therefore gets other goodies as compensation for it.  The game is perfectly balanced, you dont need to buy anything apart from the vanilla game. You won't get excluded from heists only because you didn't buy any DLC.  NOW TELL ME. What's the difference to siht like BF, COD, and other tripple ♥♥♥ stuff?  Right, these guys are the best and they dont abandon a title after the community has been milked. Ofcourse they have to make some living of it, so therefore we have the optional gimmicks. BUT no one gets excluded for not buying DLC! SO yeah, I love this game, and I love OVerkill!

Also, it has a deep customisation system with four skill trees, hordes of weapons with customisations and of course, customisable (and very cool, imho) masks for your robber. Additionally, missions (heists) have multiple elements that are randomised each time you play, so it's 'never the same heist twice.'I will be playing this game for quite some time, as Overkill has already promised 12 months of content. The only downside is that the A.I. is kinda dumb sometimes and the graphics are not industry standard, but being as this game is the price of an indy game, it exceeds all expectations.  The TL;DR version is this game is great value if you want a solid co-op game and don't mind the idea of slaughter hoards of police when you set off the alarm.",

Having to work for the mods on your guns, desperately desiring that laser attachment on your pistol to impress your friends. The cards at the end of the game add a massive benefit as well, it's like a casino and gambling, always bringing you back for more, until you've wasted all of your money, (or perhaps, time in this case). It's amazing playing with friends, telling each other to take specific paths or routes to make sure no guards notice you. Then there's the incompetent randomers that you always seem to find, the only annoying thing about it. They can't seem to draw their pistols without alerting half of America's police force. But that's all the fun of it, right? Definitely buy it, I have been playing non stop for around a week and a half and haven't looked back.  8/8 - Would tell someone to 'GET THE ♥♥♥♥ UP' again.",

People actually own up to mistakes, and then rather than getting yelled at, constructive advice or just a simple 'It's okay we've all been there' is offered.  The game itself is reasonably well designed, and a little less well developed. But neither of those things should stop you from the getting the game, because my reasons behind those statements are generally minor nitpicks. I would elaborate on why I think so, but it would make me sound like I don't actually like the game. In fact, it is the opposite. Payday 2 is easily top 5 in my list of favorite co op games, and absolutely #1 in terms of positive interactions with internet strangers.  In fact, the amount of positive reinforcement in the game is incredibly refreshing, be it from other players, or Bain encouraging you during heists. It seems like such a little thing, but the positive attitude is infectous, and makes failure much less painful, to the point where you don't even care that you and your team failed for the 10th time.  The game's mechanics are fun, and the randomness of each map setup means that playing scenarios over and over stays fun for a long time.   For those with 120+ hz monitors, the game supports them perfectly.   For at least one heist, I found that low graphics settings actually hindered my ability to beat a heist. I was supposed to read a computer screen and note what it said, but at low settings, the screen is just a blur. But other than that one instance, for that particular way of beating that heist, the game's graphics settings are flexible enough for my liking. ",

So why is the review a No? Because of greed. It was fine when they were putting out full missions, characters, masks and guns every now and then (normally coinciding with another game, I.E. Jacket), but now they put out a new DLC every week or so (or were for a minute there), and they're all just crap content for ridiculous prices. I don't understand why things have gone this route since they put out the 'Overkill' packs which were basically donations. My friends and I were HAPPY to purchase those packs because we loved the game, we loved HOW it was made and how things worked, but I will never buy another thing for this game.

The REAL fun lies in playing with friends over mics rather than random parties (however thats just my opinion).  The only problems I see with this game are that...  you may end up getting kicked from random parties by the host and have them take everything for themselves right before the game ends. I havnt even played for that long and its happened to me twice.   If you mess up at a crucial point and you are with 'serious players' prepare to have everything you are as well as your family, ancestors, and your future children slandered by the other players BEFORE they kick you.   Other than that you will very much enjoy this game. Ive met alot of nice people and have had a great time playing it so far. There are a few bad eggs but what online game doesnt have them?  If you like planning and executing rather than a run and gun you will love this game.",

But!!!!! here i have to point out two down side of it, which ruined the game 95%  Firstly there's way too much DLCs to pay for. I dont even know why they are doing it like this. You have to pay for each of the new heists if you wanna play it, and eventually you'll have to. For a gmae that tried to make money so hard, Ill say it's not so good. So be careful before you are into the game. it took me about 10 DLC to give up the game. Second, the cheats destroyed the game. There are all kinds of cheats when i was playing it, you can pretty much do whatever you want to, honestly it's kinda fun for about 10 mins and after that, done.   so I will say think it through before you buy the game.   i will highly recommend it if you have another 3 friends you can always play it with.",

It's fun and addicting. An FPS with RPG elements? (Or vise versa) YES PLEASE! No need to be witty or clever when half the steam users apply that to their own reviews. It's a load of fun. Sure, it's a pain in between my testicles to constantly pick up bags or repair drills, but the effort you put in shines at the end of every pay day. That gratifying sensation you get every time that EXP stacks higher and higher gets even better when you level up sporadically throughout the game. Almost every heist is intriguing in some way, and there's plenty of replay value. You can choose to go loud or stealth some missions, or the the complete opposite next time. The soundtrack also brings joy to my dainty ear drums. Stealth music brings perfect ambience to the table and the Assault themes are filled with a brim of that electronic goodness. What takes a toll in my ears however, are the damn callouts.  'GET DOWN ON THE GROUND' 'GET THE ♥♥♥♥ UP' 'STAY DOWN' 'HOXTON, FOLLOW ME' 'DALLAS, OVER HERE' 'OH ♥♥♥♥, CLOAKER!' '♥♥♥♥!' 'KEEP DRILLING YOU PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥!'   At least, every character has their own unique personality traits, and some of the dialogue makes me outright burst out in laughter. Overall, the game's good. Trust me. 8.5/10? Maybe even a 9. Go buy it. Ask ur mum, get a job, beg your friends, cook some meth, rob a bank, disrupt transports, destroy democracy. It's worth.",

HOWEVER, that 'content' has been largely useless DLC.

If that is the case then please look into proper management rather than raiding customers.",

            "review_text": "Okay, so you've managed to find Payday 2 on a sale page, and you're wondering... 'What is Payday 2?' Well, listen up, 'cause I'm about to tell you.  This game is mainly about robbing ♥♥♥♥, killing cops, thugs, mercenaries, Cloakers (these ♥♥♥♥ers are like Sam Fisher on speed, they will knock you down if you don't pay attention), and Bulldozers (this game's version of Juggernauts). Depending on your skills in FPS games, difficulty level, and build, these enemies will either be really easy to kill or will make your work harder.  There are several heists to play. Depending on your preferred style of play, you may either like the stealth missions more, or the assault missions more.  The Shadow Raid heist, for example, caters to stealth players, as detection results in a potential mission fail should you not secure enough loot. This heist has you sneaking into a warehouse to steal items such as cocaine, gold, artifacts, servers, money, art, and weapons.  The Hoxton Breakout mission, however, is for the heister who's not afraid to get their hands dirty or their boots wet. This mission is pure assault. It involves you blowing a wall into a tunnel to rescue a fellow heister. As a pickup truck escorts him, you escort the truck through the streets of DC, which is covered with cops, FBI, and SWAT. You then attack the FBI headquarters to erase all info of him from their database.  Builds will help you take on the cops as you amass your fortune. You can be a Mastermind, picking up revive skills and medic bags. You can be a Ghost, and pick up ECM and silent skills. You can be a Technician, picking up drill and C4 skills. You can be an Enforcer, picking up survival and damage skills. You can be a Fugitive, and pick up dodging skills. To get the best skills of each respective tree, you must stay mainly in that tree. Although this may seem bad, some skills in one tree work well with skills in other trees.  Did I mention customization yet? I should mention customization. While builds can be considered customization, you can customize each mask (if you can get one from the RNG card drop) and weapon (you're only   kind of   at the mercy of RNG, should you have the Gage Mod Courier DLC) you have.  While we're on the topic of DLC, there is a   lot   of DLC. Luckily, the people of OVERKILL were nice enough to give us a GOTY edition. This edition gives you every. single. DLC. There are soundtracks, weapons, new characters, and new heists. Although a GOTY edition normally means there will be no new DLC, there is more DLC in the works for us.  FInally, the fanbase and community is really amazing. It's not like Call of Duty, where it's mainly little children attempting to persuade you they had sex with your mother. It's a semi-mature community, who mainly want to have fun. Most of the people are really kind, and are willing to help if you are having trouble. You will however, run into a few trolls. From my experience (166.7 hrs at the time of writing this), I have only run into one troll. Others, however, only seem to find pubs full of trolls. To combat this, it's best to find some friends, or cool people from lobbies, to do private lobbies.  All in all, Payday 2 is a really good game, although it would be best to get it during a Steam Sale, as the game is 65% off for the regular edition, and 50% off for the GOTY edition.

You can have someone drop in a doctor bag, so you can bring an ammo bag. If your looking for a game where you can rob.... like every type of store imaginable. You can even steal Alesso's money from his tour! The one thing I have against this game is the A.I. It isn't horrible, but it's not great. They won't tie up civilians or the fix the drill, but if you're going loud, then they are good for killing cops and gaurds. Overall, I give this a solid 8/10, great game, but sometimes the A.I can make it a bit frustrating. Also, for being an RPG, there can be some moments where it feels like a grind.

But then they had to go and update it.  Recent updates HAVE made the game UNPLAYABLE for anyone who hasn't already unlocked every weapon, and upgraded their skill-sets fully. The developer has left anyone who is late to the party out to dry, as well as those who didn't spend every free moment levelling up.  It's terrible to see a game with so much potential get ruined by ridiculous updates. Each time I see a new update, I hope they have nerfed some of the enemies, or given more power to the weapons. But, no, they seem to constantly think the game needs to be harder, even though users have been complaining.  This is (was) a great game. But it was ruined with updates. I cannot recommend it.",

Things like network problems, not being able to move hostages or insufficient information about the game environment generated a little bit too much frustration at times. Moreover, the game felt too repetitive because there weren't enough missions.  After more and more additional heists were released, we gave the game a second chance. And luckily, everything works a whole lot better now. Additionally, the amount of content and objectives you can approach in the game has increased heavily. Also, the lack of environmental information can easily be fixed by installing the officially supported HoxHud mod.  Payday 2 in my oppinion has grown to be a very good co-op shooter. One which requires coordinated teamwork to really shine, one which provides both fast paced mass shootings, tactical combat and stealth gameplay.  If you are thinking about playing this alone or in public games, just forget about it. But if you manage to find a team that plays well together, you will have a lot of fun in Payday 2.",

The playble character has no chemistry them self to each other. The only thing they say is 'I need health!' and stuff like that. The difficulty in the matches are good. The ai is not to op neither bad.he amount of ash uyou win is dependedon the level of the heist. You can choose to spend the cash on weapons or masks or abilities. You won't be able to get all the abilities in a day. It can take forever to get unlock them all.  A quick sum up.  POSSITIVE - good graphics - variety of maps, heists, weapons and mask art. - It is challeging to new players and the better players. - Funny to play with friends. - variety of enemies. - You can choose either to go right into the action or stealth it. (Stealthing is ok. Not the smartest AI's when you are sneaking.)  NEGATIVES - Can get a little old with the same maps (even if they're many, the most common maps are the most expensive ones) - Could be better voice acting  Overall a good game. 8/10",

But others have extended a hand and given people a chance.  Co-Op with friends is by far some of the most fun I have had yet.  Minor Annoyances include, Nudging a Guard sets off the OMG hes a crook sensor. You can open doors, but cant close them. There is no way to attract or alert guards to your location for ambushes. Can't mark High Value Targets, like you can a Guard. PickPocketing should be a skill set in Ghost, or some form of like Security Card duplicator or hacking to open the security door with out a drill.  Dont get me wrong, for all the small things I am saying, there is a TON of good things.

            "review_text": "Update! I've included my original review below to show contrast, and how much the game has changed many people's opinions including my own.  Updated review:  Long story short, this game is ruined. Overkill and Starbreeze finally caved in and added what basically amounts to microtransactions. There is now a total of 36 DLCs(at the time of this review) that players have to pay for to unlock them. On top of that they've added this 'drill and safe' system, which has players pay real money for drills to unlock in game safes; heavily resembling the 'key and crate' system in Team Fortress 2., only now instead of hats and paint, you get masks and skins.  This game was fun for a while, I've spent many hours on it and put a lot of money into it as well, but as much as it pains me to see it go in this direction, I had to uninstall it. I would still recommend it for the vanilla experience, but with all these stat boosts and special weapons, it makes online play unfair. So unless you have a group of friends that are on the same page, don't bother.  It was fun while it lasted...  Original review:  PAYDAY 2 takes the formula from the first game and improves upon it immensely. While the first game is still fun on it's own, PAYDAY 2 has so much more to offer. You are able to customize guns, masks, and skills to your liking, with tons of varying options. Chose from a wide selection of heists, with more still on the way. They are constantly updating the game with new content, leaving more open options for different styles of play. The only thing I would recommend is to find a tight crew early, because sometimes you just find random strangers that either don't know what they're doing, or they simply like to grief other players. It's tons of fun and extremely satisfying. Buy it, play it, love it.",

            "review_text": "Barbie for Boys  this game comes with a great idea: bankrobbery. Become a team of four, make a plan, distribute the tasks, stealth into the lions den and start drowning in money and gold. What if anything goes wrong? If you get caught by a guard or seen by a pesant? Grab your guns and the game makes sure you have plenty of them. Defend inside the building. Pass the bags with loot on and make your way blazing to the escape van.  The difficulty of the game is very easy. Even though the maps are always a bit randomized, it soon gets boring picking out guards and binding hostages after some initial learning (hint: get a suppressor and stealth). The hardest thing are newbie co-players. But its still fun to play because you always win, in the long term. Just restart the heist over and over again and then somehow you get your loot. Lots of loot, tons of money. And the game offers lots of customisations: a hundred guns that all can be modified and upgraded, 5 skill trees, different speakers and customizable masks and appereance. Like a Barbie doll. So you can spend a lot of time turning the game into a reflection of your flavor and preferences. If you are looking for recreational fun, this game can be entertaining. If you seek out challenges, maybe the achievments are still tempting. I hope there will be a PAYDAY 3 with higher difficulty since the idea of a bank heist offers so much possibilites and the gameplay is already good.  Some portion of the game are only available through DLC. Just beware, if you buy all of them the game is expensive. Many DLC affect the overall game experiance only by a small amount.",

Weapon packs you should buy are definitely the Sokol character and BBQ weapon pack.  You can buy the other stuff but that's what is the most useful in the game itself. Everyone is complaining about the DLC packs and stuff, but its funny how they all say that but then have also have played 1000+ hours on this game. Anything that keeps you that busy for that long is worth the investment.  Bought this on sale and a couple weapon packs on sale later and love it. Tons of fun.",

PS: The core of the game has some fun elements that I like to keep playing but be very wary with your wallet. I previously wrote this review about those elements but since then this game has been tarnished to the point it deserves NO RECOMMENDATION.

PayDay 2 is honestly best with a full group of friends. It's one of my favorite co-op games of all time. If you want to play Deathwish, it takes a strategy to get all of your skill trees to compliment each other for the best set up that can get you through any fire fight. If you just want to screw around and shoot up some banks or a mall, you can set it to Normal and just have a ball.  If you want a different kind of strategy you can stealth most of the missions. You can get in and out without anyone realizing. It is one of the most satisfying things ever when you finally complete a stealth mission that you've been planning (Or learning from trial and error) for hours.  Payday also has awesome mask and gun customization. By just using a few simple materials and patterns, you can make any mask your own. And even though you can't 'technically' customize your weapons, there are so many attachments and options to choose from that you can sculpt a gun that suits all of your wants and needs.  People always complain and crack jokes about it being a 'Bag throwing simulator' but there's much more to it. You have to fight through waves of cops or wait for the perfect moment to get all of your acquired loot to the van. Yes it can take a while if you get a lot of loot, but there's almost something satisfying about it when you realize that it's taking so long because you got all the loot that you could, and it's definantly going to end up as an epic payday.  Another subject I want to touch on is people complaining about the amount of DLC. Honestly, they could have released this game for $60 and I know that most people would still buy it. It's an awesome game even without the DLC. In my opinion, DLC is just there for people who want extra content and are willing to pay for it. It's not like you're at an extreme disadvantage if you don't buy it. I mean honestly the people who are buying it are one your side so there's not much room to complain. It's not like they are able to use said guns against you. So in short, if you want to pay for some extra content, go for it. If not, that's fine too.  I think i've made my point so i'm just going to end with this: I personally think that this is an amazing game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys shooting things and getting money for it.",

I loved this game until 'Crimefest 2015' The point of crimefest is that the community does challenges, and the devs reward free content if the community completes said challenges. This year, at the first day of crimefest, they add safes and drills. Safes drop after matches, and you buy drills for 2.50, which give skins. With this, I was slightly dissapointed, because I was hoping for free content, but it wasn't a big deal. And then I realized that the skins had STAT BOOSTS. Yes, stat boosts, thus making the game pay to win. Combine all of this with the fact that they said 2 years before that they would never be adding microtransactions, and it annoys me thoroughly. But still, I left my review positive, because the skins wouldn't make the game horrible instantly. And then it snapped after the last day of crimefest, on the ask me anything on reddit. If you thought overkill gave everyone a middle finger before, it gets pretty absurd here. When asked why they added, they said, and I quote,'2 years ago we had no intention of adding microtransactions...we tripled our crew....we added this update so we can make this game as good as possible.' Where as on the starbreeze financial reports, payday only makes more money per year. This is too far, overkill. Lie to me once, whatever. Lie to me twice?  Its over.",

This game is extremly balenced due to the fact that it is a co-op game and that the better the players the more it helps you and your team so many wepons do not require nerfing   now I would like to talk about my one major complaint which is infamy grinding if you don't know what infamy is it is like the prestige system in COD but it also reqiures you to grind money aswell as levels this can be a pain as the amount of money required is so high that some missions become unprofitable (infamy is not required but most players do use it soooo)   OVERALL payday is a great game for anyone who loves shooter,team based games and other things",

            "review_text": "PIcked this up because of the demo...and a sale. ;)  I enjoy this game. It's not a giantic hoopla of aggression like a UT title, nor is it an extravaganza of whackniess that can be found on Pandora in BL. But it does occupy some space in the good-gaming column. The missions are aplenty, so are the firearms, and so are the masks. Everything'll cost you a bundle but that's so you don't buy everything after one mission. That's odd but it keeps you playing; makes it worth the efforts.  There are a few more odd aspects that get me or prevent me from really sailing through the game. Having been spoiled by other FPS games that allow one to reload while sprinting I'm constantly struggling to find a good location for just that. I often begin reloading before I run to the next best spot. It's how I've played for ages; reload on the go. But as soon as you sprint reloading stops. This leaves me with only fisticuffs. If the cops are where I had intended on going, that's when I get boomshakacaca-ed. Reloads also take awhile too...or seem too.  Forever maps/missions also seem oddly...perpetual. A constant flow of cops &amp; they never seem to run out of them (they must hire from neighboring counties) nor do they call in any 'RV's to spoil your efforts cooking endless batches of meth, etc. Probably just me though thinking about the realistic angle just as I did with the spontaneous genesis of hordes in LFD2. I guess I wanna see a chopper come in to end your campaign of illicity. It'd be like a mini-boss. Also be good to see the getaway car in the basement or really close by so you don't have to walk through hordes of dumb cops who can't figure out how to take your car out, or deprive you of it. Imagine the getaway, blowing out a garage door or screeching through dozers on the way to freedom.  Oh &amp; you can't close any doors in the entire game. No one door. Not. A. Single. Door...can be shut in this game. I'm pretty sure another key ingredient would need to be coded to get this to work, (for those of us who enjoy shutting doors it would be appreciated), but think of the extra shtuff your classes could do: open doors faster, seal doors faster, carry blowtorch, carry extra blowtorch fuel, (There is no such thing as too much 'Aliens.') use hands to cleverly apply enough force to said door in the opposite direction in which it opened in order to facilitate it's shutting, all kinds of nifty stuff.  Hell, make it a new class: Door-shutter. I WOULD BE THAT GUY. I'd be the gd butler of the team, keeping the doors shut, the drafts out. He could carry kleenex, upgradable to hankerchiefs. By the end of his tech trees he's using Jedi powers to open and close 'em from a distance. He could induse fear in citizens makin' 'em think the place is haunted (See where this is going? All because doors don't shut.)  Ok...you can shut a car door. I never saw any friends driving around in a car with the door wide open, but had I seen that, I wouldn't have been surprised. But seriously, the notion of closing a door to prevent a member of secret caste of ninja security from sneaking up on your ♥♥♥, lord knows they don't make noise when they walk, (Samurai had it down. Make your buildings with rusty nails so they squeek. sheesh.), would be commonly sensical. Right?   It's simple - break in through door, cracking an alarm, whatever, enter, turn around, shut door. I don't care if the A.I. is too dumb to care, it makes sense. As much sense as the I-like-turtles kid. You hear him, he likes turltes, you know it. It makes sense. He likes turtles, simple. Doors open and shut, simple. You can agree with both. You like turtles right? Of course you do. You like doors right? You like it when they close after they open right? Sure as hell do.",

They have recently been adding alot more free content and offering alternatives to some DLCs, although quite scarce. I also believe it would be wrong to not reccomend a game that I have hundreds of hours on (even if it is frustrating). A new problem i have is that the first time i load up, it always crashes on 93%, so I have to reopen the game, but I overlook it for now in the hope it is fixed.   Getting into a good decent game is like playing Russion Roulette. If you aren't getting kicked for no reason, loading takes ages, it crashes ect ect. The updating is the worst thing I've ever seen. Basically it downloads a chunk of the update say for example 80mb, then it stops downloading the rest and just works on the disk presumably unzippng or installing the section. It then downloads another load, then when you think it's done.. Nope. Still another 20 mins of disk usage. Too many DLCs. When you buy the game, you're basically buying a burger without the sauce. Yes, you can still eat it and it's pretty cool, but not quite complete. I'm just waiting for that all important Escape Van DLC where you have to walk to the safehouse at the end of the mission, unless you own the van.

And yes, i know that they need to make some money from DLCs too but i think there are too many of them for just simple things. For example: You buy The Diamond DLC and you get 4 masks, 1 really hard heist and thats it. Some DLCs are good like BBQ, Gage mod courier but some are just waste of money. And about changing. Everytime i play the game something changes, like skill tree is now smaller and with less perks, stats, and some mechanics. The game is overall good even if there are some bad things about it.

Both stealth and 'loud' missions are the most fun I've had with a 'horde-mode' style game since Gears of War 2 or Leaft for Dead 2, and innovates upon the genre.  PD2 often runs into game breaking bugs despite feeling polished. It feels worse runing into PD2's bugs than any game I've played.  1.) Host or party members occasionally have their game crash. (usually ending the missions) 2.) Many Event-Trigger issues: - Can't type a 3 digit security code in a casino level (among other objects you can't interact with). - Helicopter not arriving because of too many snipers/cops though it's already been taken care of.  Not being able to put points into your build, or modding weapons when the host starts a contract is a big inconvenience.  Questionable distribution method:  Freely playing new maps from DLC so long as the host owns it may seem generous of the dev's but it's not.  Most multiplayer games would die off with a devided community. The dev's found a way to sell free maps and nobody will complain because they often go on sale for dirt cheap and get bundled with things worth checking out (to enhance your experience); masks, new perks/builds, weapons &amp; weapon mods.",

But the variety of weapons and the amount of ways you can do each individual heist is really awesome. But there are some things that don't make sense.  - You can carry tons of money - You can carry tons of gold - You can carry tons of jewelry - You can't pick up more than 1 keycard - You alone can take on the whole entire army of cops - Wearing a pair of sunglasses in front of a guard or civilian will alert them and they will call the cops - You have a vault underground, and you have a load of money in that vault. But you still don't have a drill that works properly - You can kill cops with super heavy armour (Bulldozers) that shoot you with a ♥♥♥♥ ton of bullets - You still get knocked out by a cloaker - You still can't carry more than 1 keycard  So basically that is what i personally feel about the game. It has some weird things but im guessing that's just to make the game more balanced. One thing that is certain is that the developers are really hardworking and they usually come up with DLCs that are worth the money and on special occasions we actually get free DLCs  Overall, i would give this game a 8.5/10",

Basically it follows the model of CS:GO and TF2. A crate/key system (in PD2's case a safe/drill system) where a player spends REAL money to unlock a RNG weapon skin that is cosmetic. However, some skins are 'rare' (who knows how rare the drops are) and may also contain stat boosts(!)  This is borderline acceptable in F2P games, but PD2 is not F2P, it is a Pay to Play game.   Do NOT buy this game until the developers fix this (if they ever do).

PC version well supported, still going strong and forsee many many hours lost to this in the future!  *UPDATED* I have held off trying to slam this game as I have loved it so, but as one of the Completely Overkill Pack DLC purchasers, I am extremely disappointed and displeased. I actually loved the mask pack they released when I orginally bought it, had that been all they released, I probably still would have shelled out the $20 to support what at the time was a great team working on a great game. However, more was promised us, something grand and spectacular, something we'd have to just wait and see. A weapon skin is just a slap in the face. It is clear now, that Overkill has had a shakeup and the new management is simply trying to cash out and collect as much as they can to fund their newest venture. The COP clearly wasn't for Payday 2, it was probably to help along their new walking dead game. I feel almost owed a free title to that game. But that's neither here nor there. The game is still great, but I cannot reccommend a now shady developer. It's unfortunate.  *NEW UPDATED REVIEW* I gotta hand it to you guys at Overkill, as one of the many complainers and whiners from the COP, you have righted the ship here. This game is back to where it needs to be and your continued additions and support is just fantastic. I love the new One-Down Difficulty! I am going to leave my old negative review as part of this just to keep it honest how my feelings have changed. Excellent game again, live your dreams of robbing banks and sneaking behind those bumbling idiot guards! Can't wait for Payday 3!",

I am an easy target. A good buddy of mine put it best: his voice could make me play a sausage in a game. Boy, is he right.     I have not put in as many hours as many of the other players here, but I still considered Payday 2 to be one of my favorite games. I would routinely look forward to playing it with my friends after work or on the weekends. The gameplay was exciting, the teamwork was awesome, and it never got boring.   Like everyone else, I was excited about this year's crimefest. I was looking forward to seeing what new content we would get. I wasn't expecting anything mindblowing; I recognize that the game has been out for a while now, and that the developers cannot be expected to keep putting out content for which they are not generating cash. However, what we have received thus far can only be considered a scam. We were promised free content. We all put in many hours grinding during the road to crimefest to ensure that we would earn our content. We as a community promoted Payday and the developers, helping them to continue to gain popularity in a game that is more than two years old! And what did we receive in return? Certainly not what I was expecting. Certainly not what any of us were expecting. Microtransactions?! I cannot believe that they are taking a PvE game and making it a P2W.   The community who has supported this game for a long time now has been completely betrayed, and Overkill has yet to say anything to us, the fans, about why they are doing this. Damion Poiter, aka Chains, has been the only one that I have seen thus far to say anything, and he is not even a dev!   My disappointment runs deep, and I cannot bring myself to play again until we get an apology from Overkill. I want to throw my money at you! I had been waiting for the DLCs that I do not have to go on sale! And now, I cannot make myself purchase them. I refuse to support an organization who does not support us.

This game really is worth the money, especially on sale, the game definitely improved after update 100 with new skill trees. Personally, I dont really understand why DLC is so important, im sure you have read plenty of other reviews and opinions stating 'DLC DOESNT MATTER' but really, its pretty important. You can survive with the vanilla guns perfectly fine in every difficulty, but having DLC weapons really makes a more fun experience and more opportunities for different skill sets and weapon builds to change the experience. Most of the DLC heists are also fun. This game is not one of those games where you get bored quickly, but its possible if you dont change up your play style from time to time. Personally, I enjoy Stealth the most, but I dont mind shooting a bunch of cops with my body armor on either. You can play stealth alone perfectly fine, but playing with friends is always more fun. Stealth can be pretty 'cancer' as some might want to call it because of desync, which is a massive problem in this game. If the host's internet sucks, you will lag a lot. Sometimes you wont notice it on loud heists, but stealth heists makes it truely cancer. Countless amount of times I have been spotted because of desync. Anyways, Mods are another thing that overkill doesn't have a problem with, and I really appreciate that decision. HUD mods are for sure the most popular, and they really are not that hard to install, if you have installed mods on any other game you should be fine. In my opinion, this game is a must have on PC, and there is literally no reason to not have this game on your PC, its not that hard to run either. If you really really hate it, I guess you can just refund or it or not buy it all. I have bought this game for multiple friends and they have all enjoyed it just as much as I have.",

Hoxton and Huston HATE each other so play one and spam the crap out of that F key to annoy the other players 2. You dont need to buy all the DLC. . . With that said, go buy some! I recommend the Courier pack. 3. If your screen is NOT gray don't use the doctor bag plz n tnks 4. Always ALWAYS think the cloker is comming for you -you are never safe- 5. Sydney and Clover have sexy voices, Bonny. . . not so much  6. DonAcDum 7. HoxHud Isn't cheating, just dont let anyone know you are useing it. Its for 'Pub Nubs' 8. Basic 'Duck And Cover' and 'Parkour' In any of your builds -Trust me- 9. If you are Hosting a lobby dont kick everyone at the end. -Its rude- 10.

I take back everything I have said about PD2 to friends and family. OVK over the past months, this game was a downward spiral. The start of the Train Hype to the Casio to this this year's crime fest (2015). OVK, back when everything was alright, I spent till 4 in the morning making meth to get that sweet xp, bought about $50 worth of DLCs, dressed up as them for halloweens and dress up days but now, no more. Part of me wants to cuss them out and just be mad about the whole situation but the other wants to understand why all of this happened. Starting from the Train Hype to the 2015 CrimeFest. Even if OVK does not want to do anything about the whole issue, at least shead some light as to why all this is happening. We as a community want to know why the OVK studio head is going in this direction. I just hope that PD2 will come out alright after this massive CrimeFest 2015 failuer. It breaks mine and many other's like me to see and hear what OVK is doing. For now, new comer's just avoid it until this passes. Hope you guys know what you are doing.....good luck and please even a Q and A on twitch would be alright....just anything    Payday 2 is a great 4 player co-op offering many countless hours of fun and enjoyment to you and your peers. It's so called 'hiests' are basically set missions that can be acomplished two different ways: Loud or Sneaky Beaky. It also randomizes the levels by having different camera positions or doors or patrols. However, personally, I really think it falls short on the single player. It does not have a campaign, you have to do the same co-op maps. It's a small blemish on an otherwise great 4 player co-op or 3 or 2 or 1(maybe) game. I would recommend buying this game and maybe even some of the DLCs.",

They do not want to pay these programers to do it for their game, but modders are modders...and make it better. Everytime an upgrade comes around- they have to re-do their mods to work again with the game.   It always has had flaws, but now OVK and Almir have changed their ways. Back in 2013 Almir said he would not put any microtransactions into Payday 2, but now he has changed that. With the update this Crimfest time - Day 1- he added that.  In Payday 2 to upgrade your weapons from normal - you have card drops (they also had a terrible gambling thing for this- which is now gone). So to get silencers, optics, magazines, barrels, and stocks you had card drop at the end of a successful game...along with masks, colors, etc., Now they have added Safe drops to these card drops - but to open the safe - you need a drill, which costs money on the Marketplace $2.49 per drill- to open one.  There are different types of vualts, and you will get one of the many guns they have listed...you do not know which one and may already have one if you opened one already. It is not something you can choose- but you do have to pay for it....which sucks and not know what you are getting. Free weapon customization had been talked about for years on there, but not like this - and the customizations in my opinion do not look that great anyways.  Now the kicker - these customizations will boost your gun stats....so those who PAY will have better weapons, but that does not mean they are better than anyone else. I have played with many 100's of these players ...many need all the help they can get though....sorry, but true. So it's the principle of the thing they said over 2 years ago- no microtransactions in the game- not anymore...liars.  10/20/2016 update  I had given them a thumbs down, but now they have reversed their ways...again...so 180 and 180 make 360...full circle.  The safes ..when they do drop - are free to open now. yeah! of couse that was the biggest thing about the changes.

            "review_text": "It's been a year since the last year debacle about black market update, where I've given the negarive review. I decided to give them time to see if they are going to listen to the community and change things.  As of this moment, Payday 2 has changed considerably since it's release, from more balanced game between stealth and loud heists, now it is heavily biased towards loud heist.   Good things: - variety of maps, choices, weapons, weapon attachments, skills, perk decks, mutators, and masks - since it's variety it's able to attract many types of gamers - certain heists are very well done and very atmospheric, accompanied by great soundtrack  Bad things: - poorly executed multiplayer, which when it works it's great, but it needs some long overdue changes - inability to fully enjoy the game without DLC's , and trust me, you need quite a few of them - bugs, that are being worked on, but still cripple the game to this day  So what is the conclusion? Even though most of the bad points haven't changed since my previous negative review, the game keeps changing, and in the previous year, improving. Improvements started since the completion of the contract with Starbreeze, the things started to improve, no new DLC releases, and significant changes to Black market, and a lot of free content.  Because of all this, I'm happy to give this game a cautious positive review.  This decision is mostly due to behavior of Overkill and them having the courage to admit that Black market update was a mistake, and apologize, and also listen to the community and change the things for the better of the players.",

The game got a lot of backlash from a TF2 crate system and the community reacted accoridngly, thus the developers negated that system. There was also controversy over John Wick, still hate his addition but he is still here. The whole vote to kick, over ruling the host who PAID for the contracts you buy when to pick missions was controversal, they fixed it. They were pretty much bankrupt because they keep paying for the cool, but definitely expensive for an indie studio, live action film; but they stopped.   I could discuss the game's history for a moment. All I will say is, a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t has happened, but Overkill always did their best to make up for it. There's a lot they didn't do though that's slowly being addressed. I'm confident they'll do fine.   The game? It's pretty good, but it will go on sale if you wait for it. Bring some mates with you.   Pros: Good quick gameplay Lots of content Game goes on 75% sale frequently  Cons: The studio constantly puts bad ideas to life LOTS OF DLC. HOLY ♥♥♥♥.

            "review_text": "With regret,  I've played this title for over 1400 hrs. Most of them having a blast with solid, hard hitting, objective oriented, FPS action. But I stopped playing in March 2015 because I had a real problem with the Hype Train event and what it represented as to the mindset of the developer.   Essentially it was an event where you obtained 'fuel' to reach milestones and unlock free content. You obtained fuel by purchasing DLC. Yes, you bought DLC to earn 'free' content. The largest insult was the Completely Overkill DLC Pack released alongside this event. It was a pack of four masks and a 'unknown prize' that was $20 and available for only a limited time. That pack was worth the most fuel. So people were buying the mystery box, at the cost of almost an entire other game for the vague promise of a prize. As of this moment it is seven months later and that 'unknown prize' has still not been released. I could not support this connivance and so I thanked the developer for all my many fun hours and walked away from the game.  I never uninstalled the game though, I just didn't play anymore. I kept an eye on the forums, read the news and shook my head at the increasely bizarre and theme-jarring DLCs. Modern bank-robbers with medieval weapon DLC packs, ninja weapon DLC packs, WW2 weapon DLC packs, Old West weapon DLC packs. Love them or hate them, theme-jarring they remain.  Here and there though, there were nice gestures the developer made to the player base that I found refreshing. Then the Road to Crimefest event came along in October 2015 and I saw that all the challenges were in-game challenges. I thought, 'Hey that's nice of them and I've been dying to play a solid shooter lately. Why not return to Payday 2?' All these challenges unlocked free content in the upcoming Crimefest anniversary event.  So, I came out of 'retirement' and put in another 85 hours helping the community reach its goals and having some good fun. I had so much fun I was even considering buying all the DLC the next time a sale came around. One free item is released on each day of Crimefest so on Day 1, I see the first piece of what I worked for. What I ended 6 months of not playing for. I am once again disgusted at the mindset of the developer and I look at the 75% off sale and know I will not spend a dime.  A developer that had previously gone on record, not once, not twice but three times that they would never add micro-transactions to the game went and did just that. And they did a lot all at once. The rebalanced the weapons that day, damaging the viability of our most trusted tools and increasing the viability of the garbage no one uses anyway. Get it? They made the good stuff worse in order to make the bad stuff look better. Yup, balance.   At the same time they release new weapon skins. Weapon skins that strangely enough actually add stats to the weapons. So now you can get back the functionality of your pre-'balance' firearms with a skin. But how to obtain a skin? Why, when you play now some of your drops at the end of each heist can be a random safe (which makes it even harder to get weapon mods now). How do you open that safe? Oh, easy, buy a 'drill' off the steam market for 2.49. That simple!  I may still not uninstall and play again someday because I just really enjoy killing cops. But I repeat: I will never give this company another dime.  I can't even propose a way to make this right. The fact that the developer thought that this was a good idea at all, after all their other backlash inducing poor ideas tells me that this developer is beyond salvaging. I want no part in suggesting anything because it has becoming increasingly obvious this developer only listens to bad suggestions.  And I am further disgusted that this is around the fourth time that a contraversial decision was made by the developer that just happens to coincide with a large sale/free weekend. That tells me that the developer is more than aware of the contraversial nature of their decisions and so every misstep that disgusts the veteran player base is accompanied by an influx of new players who don't know any better.  I am appalled.  In a way I almost recommend the game still because the game itself is... well it's good.   I cannot support this developer any more though. Over the course of the game's life they have broken promises. They have made sweeping post-release changes numerous times that changed entire portions of the game's functionality - if the game said 'beta' on it that is something else entirely. They have divided their player base, have no PR, put little 'jokes' in the game like safe's that tell you to suck it and an enemy that tells you to go cry on the forums. The developer is unprofessional and have now shown themselves to be greedy on top of that.  Ramble ramble rabble rabble yadda yadda yadda ya",

I'd grab the GOTY edition with some extra dlc it might not have. if you ask me STAY AWAY FROM: the butcher mod/ak pack (hard to get the mods and they hardly change anything), dragon character pack (lions roar is good, but generally isn't too much fun), alesso hiest (matever is awesome but the hiest itself is kinda boring, masks sucks too), and the overkill pack (minigun is the worst weapon in the game and the RPG while doing 10,000 damage is so hidiously inaccurate that the standard cops can shoot them out of the sky).",

Leveling up on the first one was a bit confusing to me, but the heists were still fun to play through and to get a feel for the game. I love playing this game, that is if you don't mind killing cops and security guards to get rich. Rob banks, cook Meth, destroy Malls, run errands for the mob, etc. and listen to Bain. He will keep ya out of trouble. God forbid don't kill any innocents! There are tons of weapons that can be modded out and lots of customization for the character that you choose to play. You can get lots of different masks to wear, and can re-craft them how you want if you got the right materials.   Playing offline is ok, but the A.I. of your teammates suck. If you play online it is better and you will get rich fast if you play with people that know what they are doing. I have so many hours into this game than what it says because I played offline a lot. If you play on a harder level, prepare for a good challenge. Having a good team with different skillsets help. There is downloadable content that you can get for this game like extra weapons and extra heists. Did I mention this is a first-person shooter? If you are used to playing Counter-Strike with keyboard and mouse setup, you will be at home with the controls.  There has been a lot of dlc content for this game that has come out. You don't have to have the dlc to a heist to play with a person that is hosting that heist on multiplayer. You don't really need all the dlc content to have fun. But I do suggest getting some of the starter Gage mod packs, and mod courier pack if anything. After a while, the dlc content just adds extra fun heists to do, more guns and weapons that really don't give you an advantage most of the time, and different masks and patterns to collect. There are a few character packs to add flavor and many many achievements to do ( i love these). Right now it's neverending with more dlc to come! This is a very popular game, if you played it, you would see why.   Now go out and make some cash and get rich beyond your wildest dreams!",

At certain times it feels as if no one is cooperating on your team and this game heavily depends on teamwork. A minor complaint is how I personally feel as if the mouse sensitivity is too high on a 800 dpi mouse. Even on the lowest sensitvity It feels like a do a 360 every time I mouse the mouse an inch or so. All in all iwould recommend payday 2 as it gives you a great feeling that no other game can when you finish a heist and watch as you earn 2 million dollars instantly.",

            "review_text": "UPDATE: Overkill was bought by Starbreeze, who co-developed the original PayDay 2. 505 Games was the publisher. Starbreeze bought Overkill, making Overkill a subsidiary of Starbreeze. At update 100, PD2 had microtransaction drills added, used to open safes, similar to CS:GO's cases. Ulf Andersson, co-founder of Overkill and Wolf's likeness and voice, left Overkill a while after to start his own company. Starbreeze bought back the PD2 IP from 505 Games, owning complete control and splitting sales figures.  MOST RECENT UPDATE COMMENT: IMO, Overkill has fixed the microtransaction debacle quite well. Safes no longer need drills, you can still sell your stuff on the market, and there are stat boosts that drop as normal weapon mods.  Recent changes to skill tries make a lot more sense and allow for some really powerful builds. It also means that you can more easily specialize into things like Masterforcer, because you can just spec into the tree that gives your the ICTV and the tree that gives you inspire.  I think the recent buyback of the Payday 2 IP from 505 Games has been great for Overkill/Starbreeze.    ORIGINAL REVIEW: First off, I'm going to admit I'm biased. I loved the first game in the series, Payday: The Heist. It wasn't the most amazing game, but it was fun, challenging, and engaging enough to hold your attention for a while. Payday 2 ups the ante in every respect.  A 4-player co-op game, Payday 2 pits your crew in a large array of different missions. Missions are much more varied than in Payday 1, allowing you to do entire missions in stealth or go in guns blazing. Once you begin completing missions, such as robbing a stripmall, stealing paintings from a gallery to help blackmail a politician, stealing a fusion generator prototype for oil barons, and other various activities (including lots of drug smuggling and meth cooking), you will begin to gain XP to level up your character and gain items to begin customizing how you want to play and look.  Character customization includes a dizzying array of weapon mods for tons of guns, the all-important mask customization, 5 different skilltrees, and 5 Perk Decks that can be equipped to augment your build. Many of the skills augment specialties from other skilltrees and you will be able to reach top-tier skills in two trees, with several skill points left over, by the time you reach Level 100. After that, you can Infamy (similar to Prestige in CoD) to gain some perks and some masks, and then start looting all over again.  The various ways you can approach levels ensures that playthroughs will be about as varied as the masks of the heisters you play them with. Even the best-laid plans can go wrong with a guard coming at the wrong time or a camera that you forgot to take out. While there are set places for things, things are never in the same place every time. Camera positions, vault locations, loot locations, etc. are all randomized, and even some level designs are randomized. Missions rarely ever play out exactly the same.  Thinking back on how different this game is today than it was at launch is interesting. The game has expanded greatly and added a bunch of new features. Just as much free stuff has been added as has DLC, and the DLC missions only restrict you from creating a lobby for that mission, not joining one. So, even if you don't own the Armored Transport DLC, you can still join those missions when someone else hosts them. It's a great idea that doesn't split the community.  Also of note: On top of all of the looting and shooting is an excellent soundtrack from Simon Viklund, infamous for his work on Bionic Commando: Rearmed. Payday 2's soundtrack is great, especially if you're a fan of Viklund's work, and there's a wide variety of tunes to appreciate.  That aside, there are downsides. The game isn't exactly a graphical powerhouse, although it certainly doesn't look bad either. Just don't expect to be blow away. There are glitches and bugs. And the biggest letdown has to be the CrimeNET interface that you select your missions and lobbies from. CrimeNET is an interesting idea that simply does not quite work like it should. It winds up being more of a hassle than it should and due to some networking issues, you sometimes have dead lobbies stick around long after they've closed. Overkill has said they're looking into solutions, but there is no current word of what or when. It's basically been the only real hangup for what is an otherwise stellar title.",

But leveling up doesn't directly affect health or difficulty of your enemies, so a Level 100 player can play with a Level 1 player with no real penalty.  You play with up to a 4-person crew. To get the most out of the game, I highly recommend playing it co-op with friends. The experience is vastly different in co-op vs solo. While all of the missions are possible in solo, any mission where you have to transport a large number of loot bags is rendered tedious because the AI players will not carry loot for you.  Heists include bank robbery, art theft, jewelery store raids, weapon and drug hauls, and more. Almost all of the heists can be completed in stealth without police presence, or you can go in with guns blazing.  This game is head and shoulders above the original Payday: The Heist. It improves everything that was good, and fixes everything that was bad. Development is ongoing, with free updates adding new content and gameplay, and DLC offering new weapons and missions.  For the achievement junkies, this game has a ton of them. Very few are 'gimmies' (ie, 'you did what you were supposed to do, here's an achievement'), such as reaching Level 5/10/25/50/75/100. A lot of them are insanely difficult, such as killing the most heavily armored unit in the game with a knife, or completing each mission on the hardest difficulty level. In between you'll find some for completing certain missions a specific way, or racking up kills with a specific combination of mask and gun. There's something for everyone.

Now, I wasn't one of those people who abused the infinite body bags before these updates, like completely stealthing a bank heist on overkill by killing everyone in the map, but I did use it to my advantage in maps like Nightclub where all I needed to do was kill everyone in the back and go about my business.  After we were given limited body bags and overkill non-stealthing was made even more difficult thanks to Spooks, I ended up leaving the game for some time.  I had given the game a lot of thought after though, as it has been one of my favorite shooters to date. So, I finally picked it back up.  Now, I still fear getting to the higher levels in this game because the EXP scale is ridiculous later on, but I'm finding the little add-ons they put in, like stealth bonuses, certain jobs giving bonus exp and the option to find courier packs for small EXP bonuses, to be quite rewarding early on. What I don't like is the penalties put on maps that you've done before, I know they don't want this game to be all about grinding, but what if I want to play certain maps over and over because I'm really good at them? Should I be penalized for that? Personally I don't think so and I find it lessens the amount of time I put into the game. Sure my list of maps I can do is pretty long, but it still sucks to go through them all in one play through and then have to wait a few hours before I can get the full amount of EXP from them. I'd rather grind in a game, any game, than have to limit my time playing the game.  Other than that, the game is still fun for me even after the updates that previously killed it for me. The maps have little changes I noticed that I'm interested in seeing what they do, the NPCs are less bull**** when in certain situations, the gameplay is still entertaining that keeps me coming back. Payday 2 has certainly not lost its touch with the new updates, sure there's the EXP thing I mentioned, but other than that nothing really comes across as wrong to me about this game.   I still recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good strategic shooter or just loves FPS games all-around. If you like the combination of RPG elements with your shooters, this game is right up your alley. Oh, you like customization too? Customize your masks and your guns. Tons of customization with just two items to do it on, they can be a little pricey, but hey, it's fun.",

Lots of gun and mask customization. The only minus for me was that they could have gone much deeper with a self-selling genre like this. For example, when you are holding up a place full of civilian hostages, the cops shouldn't just storm the place guns blazing. Adding some advanced negotiations and tactical decisions would make the game more realistic and add replay value. Personally on the fence about buying it (mostly bc of all the unlocks on my char).

            "review_text": "Payday 2 has its problems.   - Terrible AI making solo play an irritating way to go about playing unless you're playing all stealth.  - The repetitive feeling when playing some heists because of objectives being so similar to one another.   - Weapon\\Mask\\Attachments being extremely expensive compared to what you earn in-game,   - and finally lack of much weapon balance (Some weapons are great and everyone uses them while some aren't too much good in their own ways making them less popular).   That's pretty much the big problems with the game. Here's the thing, while you may think that playing only Co-Op and that there will not be much replay value in the game along with the other 3 problems always in effect, that that would cause you to not play this game, you would be wrong.  This game is awesome, graphics are majorly better than the predecessor and the gun play feels perfect for a shooter, better than any other AAA FPS out there especially when you hipfire at a law enforcers head, it may be better than Farcry 3's gun play system even without any lean or peeking system.  The sound for this game is amazing especially on home theatre systems and expensive headphones, but it is just as good with speakers/laptop speakers.   Customization is a lot better than even Battlefield 3 or 4 with the amount of options available, and some attachments, even with negative effects on your gun make it look absolutely awesome and worth the downsides.   A lot of heists come with the main game, while not as much as many people including me thought we would get from what the developers were saying (Misunderstandings by both parties and mistakes by the devs with what they were planning), it has smart, and very enjoyable freedom abouts in the heists included. Also, like the predecessor, the game does not split the players away from one another when it comes to DLC. If the host comes with the DLC maps then people who join who do not have them can play them, the same applies to the Grenades that were released with a weapon pack DLC.   Enemies are smart and ruthless, they come in different types and all have their own type of abilities, for example, the Bulldozer is pretty much like a man covered in super bomb proof armour making him very strong and the Tazer which I bet you can make from the title.   Smart skill customization makes everyone unique in their own ways, whether it be a fast but powerful soldier to a stealthy c4 wielding heavy damage dealer. Annual events are held for Christmas, Halloween and the like, that add content and achievements. And lastly, this game has major improvements planned all the time, whether it be DLC or patches.  If none of that convinces you, keep this in mind. In either 2 weeks - 1 month after the game launched, there were 10 bugfixing, content providing patches released (while it made it feel like a beta, it did a lot more than any beta I've played with constant updates in terms of content and fixes) and with more free content coming in the future.  Buy this game, even if it for some random reason goes up to $60 USD. This game is worth a hell load more than lots of AAA game that's at that kind of price, so buying it for half of that and getting a hell load more fun out of it is definitely worth it!",

Diffirent types of play styles but the game mostly rewards you on duing stealth.  Game will feel like a grind at one point but the game is all about replaying the missions several times. This is also why it is better to do with a few friends, so it becomes you playing with friends and you level at the same time and not that you play just to level. That will take away the fun some times.  Game is not 100% complete though. A few bugs here and there but I would say bear with it. They are constantly bringing out updates that fixes a few things but at times the bugs can become too much. ",

Make it work and you feel the rush of collecting the rewards and getting your payday. Fail and watch as your crew turns on one another and when things get hot, may even leave each other to save themselves.   But before you think the missions are formulaic, the devs took a L4D approach by randomizing elements of gamplay, such as locations (or existence) of mission items, number and frequency of guards, cameras and civilians.  Unlike many other games where stealth is OP, the stealth in this game is so difficult that when you actually pull it off it feels amazing. Most often, however, You end up slealthing 'until you blow it' at which point hopefully you've completed enough objectives that your team can hold off the SWAT forces long enough to finish the job and GTFO.  Jobs are not repetitive, either. Everything from robbing stores, organizing bank jobs, rigging elections, shooting up shopping malls, pulling train heists, hitting art galleries, looting warehouses and even cooking in meth labs and tons more. This is NOT a typical co op shooter experience.",

Never played the prequel, not really heard of this one... Until I have gotten it around Easter 2014 and it just blew me away! This game is fresh, new and all about teamplay. It belongs to the very top list titles and would be similar to Left 4 Dead, but also different. You plan heists, rob banks, rob transports, take hostages - everything you (normally) wouldn't dare to do in real life. This is an awesome game and a 'must' for everyone who likes team shooters and first person games!",

If a game does not work, then you cannot play, and a game that works is always better than one which does not work. Would you rather a pacman arcade or Crysis running at 5 FPS? And this game essentially requires multiplayer, with all its connection issues. The AI assisting you are dumb, the AI for the enemies are dumb, about the only seemingly not dumb AI are the ones who are supposed to press the panic buttons. But back to technicals. I have a generation one i7 with a GTX 580 and I can't run this on full HD. Maybe I have old drivers or I heated them too much you say, okay perhaps that explains the low FPS, but it certainly isn't causing the mouse lag. Look it up. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ problem I've never seen happen in any other game. If I lower resolution to 1600 900 its workable but anything higher and the mouse is not crisp. Thankfully the AI are dumb so it's like playing a zombie game when you're shooting but this carries over to the menus. Like, really? There's a host of other technical problems too, including the game crashing when you attempt to accept a friend invite to a game. Which you basically have to because the lobby system in this game is garbage.  And it has to be, because otherwise it'd be all too clear that this game has 0 content. Starting a mission requires you to look at what appears to be a map of a city, and then there are random dots that show up here and there. You aren't allowed to just pick a certain mission or a certain difficulty, you have to wait for it to pop up. It's not even in predictable locations; you'll find the exact same mission spawn on two entirely different points on the map. The maps have slightly different spawns totally to maybe five variations tops on each mission, but overall its the same stuff. This randomness is also in equipment: you can buy your base guns, but every single mod and every single mask component has to be obtained through random draw at the end of missions through this pick a card thing. Oh, and you still have to pay for them.  And every single mission briefing or ending there are people talking about the 'story' in the background.  And that's the game. What did I pay 30 bucks for again? This is an 'Action RPG'? Where's the action and where's the RPG? Maybe RPG stands for Random Player Game, because even the player's own equipment can only be obtained through lottery.  If you always have 3 friends playing with you then perhaps going full stealth every time inserts a little strategy and coordination into it, but just playing by yourself or with pubbies will always just turn it into Zombies: Stealing Cash With Clown Masks Edition.",

Co-Op: WIth 3 other friends (total of 4 for a full crew) you will have an endless amount of fun. You will go from petty padfoot to criminal mastermind with a tight crew of buddies and it will feel very rewarding. If you have a tight crew you can stealth/shoot your way through any mission. I highly recommend the physical presence of your friend playing this (that old fashioned LAN feeling) but if not then use the voice chat as much as possible.  Solo: It's a bit harder to sell this game to someone who doesn't have a friend or 3 who already own it. However, if you can pick it up on sale it's so worth it because the community is very forgiving and accepting. You'll eventually start meeting some people that you will begin to heist regularly with and from there on my thoughts above will apply to you from then on. Essentially it's a harder start solo because you'll be a bit overwhelmed and PUGs (pick up groups) are either hit or miss but once you find some good members you'll have a tight crew in no time. Just, if you play solo and you're new; listen to the vets if they give you isntructions, they're not trying to be bossy they just want your heist to go well and get you money and xp.",

The stealth techniques have been completely revamped and the game has turned into a top selling game. The skills, inventory and masks options are a great feature new to the game which really makes customization a huge possibility. The skills and inventory can be toned down to personal preference and to helping with a certain heist. For example if you are going to stealth (which is possible in nearly every contract) then you might want to buy a silencer attatchment for your pistol or primary with low armour to lower your player visibility. Or if you're more of a 'go loud' type of player, you can armour up and start throwing grenades and trip mines around the place. The skill system has 5 seperate trees. One for mastermind, enforcer, engineer, ghost and fugitive. All of these different skill trees have a huge roll within the Payday 2 contracts. You can max out one skill tree or mix and match to choose the perfect combination for your player.  This is by far one of my favourtie game, and with the great community and a great company. The game gets updated so often!

            "review_text": "Should be called Stealing Things Simulator 2018, really really-stic, wonderful graphics, great grameplay.  THERE IS A TL;DR PART IF YA SCROLL DOWN, K? K.  The menu/start-a-game thing is really stupid, you have to sit and wait for the contract you want to play. If you don't want to sit and wait for the right contract, you can buy that contract using your off-shore shekels. That part pisses me off since you sometimes have to sit and wait for like 5 mins.  Another bad thing is the invisible walls, you feel like you could go anywhere you want to but then poof, you get stopped by an invisible wall.   There's one more thing that I might be alone in thinking, and that is the Perk system. So there are these perks right? And these perks play a HUGE role in this game, and the way you get these perks are by leveling up, nothing new there right? But if you're at a low level, you can't get all the things. For example there's a Saw perk, which lets you unlock the saw tool. This saw is needed if you don't want missions like the Bank Heist: Deposit to get reaaaally boring. For you who haven't played the game, in this mission you have to enter the bank vault and unlock these deposit boxes, not so hard right? WELL, without the saw you have to pick the locks by hand which takes like 20-30 seconds each, and there's five boxes per letter in the alphabet minus Y and Z, which makes a total of 120 boxes (i might be wrong on this, but search for the bank heist 'bank heist deposit' so that you get a clue on what i'm talking about). I did the whole mission stealthy-stealthy, and it took us 10 minutes to get all the boxes open. Imagine 10 minutes of just sitting there and looking into the wall. Really fun. (I do realize that the boxes are surposed to be a bit of a gamble but still, if you want to ace it, it takes far too long)  Otherwise it's a great game, missions are pretty much always different in some way, the cameras, the coke, the guards, the everything, switch places everytime you play the mission so you can't just speed run the whole thing and know the exact location of stuffings, you have to search the place for the dank bank monys. The game is really strategical, which makes it so different from other games in my opinion. You can actually stealth a bank, meaning that you can enter a bank silently and get out without having to deal with the coppers. This keeps you playing as you want to complete a heist as smoothly as possible.   I missed a lot of positives, but there are a lot of positives, and they outweigh the negatives by far.  TL;DR awesome game, has a few flaws but the positives outweigh the negatives. If you ever thought to yourself 'I wonder how it would feel like robbing a bank', then buy this game.  8/10",

I purchased one DLC pack on sale and was suprised to find out that I did not actually buy the weapons and masks featured on the page, but merely unlocked the /possibility/ to unlock them from regular play. I felt a little cheated and wish I had known that information before purchasing the DLC, as it wasn't prominantly stated that there's no guarentee that you'll get what you pay for.   7/10, would be higher if the DLC was a bit more honest.",

If you're going at it alone, expect to get really bored, really fast. If you're lucky enough to have gaming buddies who are up at odd hours, then it's definitely a title you'll wanna grab. Second, the upgrades are tough to come by. It's not even about the top tier guns - it's about the upgrades that you may or may not by chance be able to install on them. Due to a random draw system, you can't just install upgrades to your guns. You have to win them by chance with every mission you finish. This forced me to do card runs with people - if you don't know about card runs, it's the only fast way to get upgrades/perks/masks in the game. It can get repetitive and ridiculous. My fastest mission complete was 17 seconds. Anyways, I digress. Overall, a very fun, challenging game to play with friends.",

Pros:  - Fun with friends, accidently shooting civilians can now be shared with your buds.  - Quite a lot of arsenal and customisation so you can shoot cops in style.  - The devs are decent for an indie company.  - The game and DLCs are quite commonly on sale (so wait till the nearest sale if you want to get it)  Cons:  - NO ANTI-CHEAT, the only form of anti-cheat is 'auto-kick cheaters' which can be disabled by host.  - Lots of hackers, as an insult to the no anti cheat, people will go about with all skills, god mode, infinite ammo Etc. some are so blatantly obvious it hurts (my friend and I kicked a guy who had 5 hrs on the game and hacked himself up all infamy levels, kinda like prestige levels for those who aren't familiar with infamy.)  - Most of the good stuff for this game is located in DLCs so buying the base game on its own is quite a s*** deal.  - The bugs are unreal, the cops are so determined to kill you they'll charge through solid walls to get you.  To quickly conclude, the reason I have a lot of hours on this game is because I have friends to play this with and does make the hackers and anti-cheat an irrelevant issue to us, since we don't hack and if we do open our game to the public we will kick any obvious hackers, so if you do have friends to play with I would suggest picking it up cheap during a sale and get a few of the weapon packs if you have the spare money. If you don't have friends to play this with then I would suggest staying away as playing solely with the publics is just bad, so for the average person reading this review I will assume you may have heard of this game and wanted to check it out.

Ive noticed more and more cheaters and hackers in the game lately but if u enjoy that then knock yourself out. 3.Overall this game is a really fun in my opinion get dlcs to make it better. This game for me is 8/10 just remember to play with 3 other friends and it'll be a blast or u can play with randoms and see how that turns out, but in my opinion its a waste of your time, but who knows you might make friends through that.

They engineered the game in a way that you WILL get hit by bullets one way or another unless you avoid fighting altogether. That's sort of the reason I enjoy this game - it really does put an emphasis on teamwork and avoiding combat.  Every contract you complete earns you money which you can use to purchase new weapons, masks, mods etc. You also recieve skill points as you level up. The game gets easier as you reach higher levels but it's just as addictive (if not more) as the first time around.  There are many AI glitches in this game from enemies just standing there waiting to get shot to enemies that can detect you from a mile away. Stealth is NOT the game's strongest suit. Regardless, it's a good game to grab when it's on sale as you will find your financial investment in the game will provide a return that is two-fold.",

If you're playing with random peeople it can still be fun. You can level up, unlock new gun mods and masks, but it takes a long time to get the ones you want. That's why you have to grind. OVERKILL keep updating the game and releasing new DLC to make the game even better and more fun. It can get repetitive sometimes, but you'll still have fun. I would rate this game 9/10.

However, in the gameplay department, it really pushes Co-Op gameplay to what we all want it to be.   Now don't get me wrong, I'm actually more of a lone wolf when it comes to gaming. I don't communicate well, and I'm often off doing my own thing while everyone else is getting stomped. That being said, I didn't think that this was going to be such a fun game without the Co-Op. But when you really start playing it, you quickly find that you can solo missions with the right planning (and alot of patience) and you'll often approach each scenario differently than Co-Op. But when it gets down to it, I really believe that this game is strongest in the smash and grab approach of the heists. Battling waves of cops is surprisingly fun, and the feeling you get when you complete a heist on overkill or deathwish with some friends is really something else. Therefore, I highly recommend this game to all gaming personalities, and encourage you to get the associated DLC. The Big Bank is a beast that any real gamer needs to slay.",

I'm a huge fan of good or fitting music in games and this game delivers on that front, so it gets big points for being hype in the music department. Not only is the music good though, all the sound design is really awesome, all the guns really sound like they could be guns. I was pleasantly surprised that the old players and new got along quite nicely and cooperation comes quickly when trying to succeed.  Overall this game is totally worth 30$, but needless to say you should try and buy it cheaper unless you really want to give these devs the money.",

Its not hard to look it but still noticibe that some things are poorly done. Aside from that, its still well made.  Gameplay 8/10 There's more than 1 way to complete a heist. You can go guns blazing, fighting off cops, drilling into safes, blowing up vaults, sawing through doors, etc. Or you can go quietly, capturing hostages, shooting out cameras, finding keycards etc. And every mission isn't exactly the same. The level is always changing from Security rooms or vaults being put in different locations, to the way the guards patrol, to camera locations.  Customization 8/10 There are so many things you can do with your guns. You can turn an assult rifle into a long range sniper with different attatchments. You can change guns to be more concealed and add silencers to help with stealth missions.  Overall 8/10 Playing this game has made me want to watch all the good heist movies like Oceans 11-13, Now You See Me, The Italian Job, etc. Its so well done that you keep coming back for more. It tickles your greed just enough for you to go back in and collect that last bag of cash. Very well done.",

I think it's a great game which puts you into the shoes of experienced bankrobbers and allows you to completely ♥♥♥♥ up their reputation by getting wrecked by security guards on normal difficulty. However, there are a couple of glitches and difficulty spikes which can be extremely frustrating to deal with if you're not experienced at the game, or if you don't have a group of friends to work together with. Numerous times I've had security guards spawn inside me while stealthing a bank heist, ruining it. Many times units seem to go through the walls, but that may just be because of slight lag. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy the game but it's rather glitchy and quite unbalanced in some aspects which may put off the more casual breed of players. To sum it up: Pros: -Great fun with friends -Many weapons to choose from -Very interesting and cool mechanics -There is nothing more satisfying that pulling off a stealth heist for the first time -Difficult for the right reasons -You can yell 'Get the ♥♥♥♥ up' and your teammates will magically ignore all injuries and continue to fight -Hillarious voice lines -Many heists which all require different skills to complete -DLC that doesn't cost much, and adds just that little bit more to the game, but you do not need to buy any for the full experience in the first place -Constant updates from Overkill  Cons: -Difficult for the wrong reasons (Yes I know I mentioned the opposite, but you will know what I mean) -RNG drop system for masks and attachments, seriously. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing pisstake. -Massive skill curve for the higher difficulties, difficult to ease into -Rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments -Enemies have the tendencies to spawn inside you (Or maybe that's just me and I'm just a very popular choice for guard spawns) -And I was going to mention cheaters, but thank ♥♥♥♥ they have been removed from ruining legit people's games.",

It's predictable and the intelligence of the AI doesn't surpass that of a toaster. In fact, the AI on Payday 2 hardly comes close to that of the first unreal tournement. On my first game I spent over an hour and a half in an open vault, fending off law enforcement not through a tight passage, but literally in the middle of the bank. About 1/10th of in-game time is spent looking down your iron sights, compared to the 27/10ths of your time fixing the drill.   It's a laugh to play with mates, but as far as dedicated gaming goes - it's poorly developed but well shined. Fit for a comedian who can get enough material for an 8 hour 'What's up with Payday 2' show.   That said, it is a nice game to have tried and owned - but I wouldn't reccomend paying anything over 5$ for it.",

They do not function as the other weapons in the game.  Specifically, you cannot aim with them. Both hip fire and right-click zoom give absolutely no aim. No white-crosshairs, no iron sights, no option to add sights. You just hold the gun off to your right, like its welded to your shoulder, and shoot.  It disregards all other mechanics established in Payday2 and is just oddly irrational. If they were trying to balance them by making them un-aimable, all they did was break apart how Payday2 gun mechanics work and give you a few crappy pieces.  The LMGs also have about 10 possible mods total. Very minor ones too, so don't plan on customizing them in look or function. This is just another example of how the LMGs don't follow the Payday mechanics at all. Its very odd and awful. Pretty much all there is to say for the LMGs is you can hold the trigger for a while. But, you can't really aim or customize.   TLDR; CAGE WEAPON PACK #2 disregards how the mehcanics of Payday2 works and delivers disfunctional equipment.  ",

Backed by an extensive achievements list, there are plenty of maps and experiences worth having in this game, but casual gamers might find some of it repetative after a while. The general expectation is to level to 100, then turn in all your chips and do it again in order to earn a special mask and some bonus stats to make the next ride a bit quicker, but really once a player gets there the first time, the necessity in going 'Infamous' is pretty lackluster if you don't care about the astehtic masks. The game allows a player to have four different skill-sets that being Infamous discounts in the hope of getting all the abilities in one skill-set build (which is really non-plus if you plan ahead).   If you plan on going Infamous, one key note: buy extra weapons with your surplus cash. Don't burn it! Sell back the weapons at a loss in order to get an easy couple of million to repurchase skills again afterwards (you'll level faster, and find yourself needing the money).  Two best skill sets: Technicians and Ghosts. Don't discount the value of a quiet drill or the ability to open a safe by hand!  Cons: 1.) Expansions/DLC are incredibly expensive for their return. For the most part, the DLC's are all just fluff. Very few of the weapons offer anything that you can't achieve with standard options. 2.) Novelty of the game can wear thin after the first trip to 100. 3.) Many of the non-infamous masks are ugly or generally just too far a step away from something I found 'fun' to wear. 4.) Offline mode is pretty much impossible without earning a decent amount of skills to offset the lack of intelligent players in the AI's. To often I watched the AI let someone die just to keep shooting a cop, or just stand around while things go to hell. They also wont pick up a bag to save their lives. 5.) There is an anti-taser skill that does not work. 6.) Cloakers.  Pros: 1.) A lot of maps, and consequently a lot of tactics patterns to learn. Stealth and Loud both have multiple approaches in all the maps. 2.) Most achievements can make the game a bit more fun. 3.) Even though mods award randomly, it's still pretty easy to modify weapons regularly. 3.) Headshots actually matter, being good at them matters even more. 4.) Dozers are fun to kill with silenced SMG's as a ghost with armor piercing while point-blank aimed at the face. You think the uniforms that show up with no body armor go down fast? Ha! 5.) Easy game to on-board, even easier to sleep-walk through for a good dream.  8/10, Would fill a van with 500 pieces of a rare, one of a kind Samurai armor again.",

Magnum as fast as a Glock or cops that are invincible but its pretty much balanced. The game overall is nice it has great maps great weapons and many other great things. However there is a problem some heists, guns,weapon, mods and masks are locked by DLC as of 8/14/2015 all the DLC combined is worth about $101USD but if you have the cash you get a lot of stuff.

All good so far. About ten minuites into the heist, the vault is opened and they start removing the loot. Since all of the civilians are dead the police were never called, the heist is easy, people are bored and simply jumping around, throwing grenades at things.  It was at this point i realized that their health was low from this, and seeing one of them on a glass roof,  decided to have some fun:  Throwing three grenades into my teammates i killed all three in one go, and with a message of: i'm taking the cash, goodbye suckers,  I departed with the bags towards the van. No sooner had i reached the van did the game suddenly close, and i recieved a message saying:  'You were kicked from the game.'  Bear in mind that regardless of wether they were alive at the end of the game they would still be paid, they decided to kick me anyway even though they would have gotten a share of the cash, and because they were dead would have to restart.  Moral of the story?  there are some petty, petty, people out there who cant take a joke, and indeed would rather waste fifteen minuites than take a joke in good humour.

People actually own up to mistakes, and then rather than getting yelled at, constructive advice or just a simple 'It's okay we've all been there' is offered.  The game itself is reasonably well designed, and a little less well developed. But neither of those things should stop you from the getting the game, because my reasons behind those statements are generally minor nitpicks. I would elaborate on why I think so, but it would make me sound like I don't actually like the game. In fact, it is the opposite. Payday 2 is easily top 5 in my list of favorite co op games, and absolutely #1 in terms of positive interactions with internet strangers.  In fact, the amount of positive reinforcement in the game is incredibly refreshing, be it from other players, or Bain encouraging you during heists. It seems like such a little thing, but the positive attitude is infectous, and makes failure much less painful, to the point where you don't even care that you and your team failed for the 10th time.  The game's mechanics are fun, and the randomness of each map setup means that playing scenarios over and over stays fun for a long time.   For those with 120+ hz monitors, the game supports them perfectly.   For at least one heist, I found that low graphics settings actually hindered my ability to beat a heist. I was supposed to read a computer screen and note what it said, but at low settings, the screen is just a blur. But other than that one instance, for that particular way of beating that heist, the game's graphics settings are flexible enough for my liking. ",

A Microtransaction economy to let our players have rainbow paint jobs on their guns for more dosh, thats also pretty much copy pasted from CSGO.

And hey for the free content part of a update, lets do a weapon rebalance about as balanced as an anvil is to a feather. And since they're going to let us get away with all of that, lets also make the weapon skins add statistic bonuses just to remove all doubt that we were trying squeeze our target market's wallets with P2W dlc.

And yes, the loot has unique stats that your less affluent friends won't be able to get unless they pay.   **  I love Payday 2, but until Overkill rethinks its overly aggressive monetization strategies for this game, i'm gonna have to leave it with a big ol thumbs down.",

I definitely recommend playing the demo to get a feel for how the mechanics work outside of the usual fps pew pew pew. The most fun I've had is when a plan is made on the spot after casing a job, and following through to get the loot out as quietly as possible. A few jobs will take a while to learn and get the most out of by yourself. After that, you'll start to get the feeling that you could do bigger jobs with just one more person (and that will keep happening until you finally are playing with a group of four). It's definitely a great co-op game where each person can pick perks that allow for specific roles in a job. The randomization of each area keeps the game fresh so replaying a job won't always go the same way each time.  EDIT:  I consider this review to be too out of date with what has been added to the game since then. The recent CS:GO-like skin system would have been ok with me if they didn't have stat boosts attached to them. Now buying skins is practically necessary to get the most out of your guns. You can't even rely on opening safes unless you own all the DLC containing weapons since you can get skins for guns you don't have. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this money sink. There are plenty of other games out there that are worth your time.",

            "review_text": "Giving this game a thumbs down review until they remove the b.s. micro-transactions which they promised they wouldn't put in the game. Blatant lies like that should never be tolerated as acceptable behavior.                   Old review: Awesome game when playing with friends, endless fun. Generally not a bad game when playing with complete strangers either. But it's definitely not a great game when trying to play solo which is what this quick review will be based on.  Trying to complete a heist in stealth while playing solo is a complete nightmare for most of the heists since the AI doesn't do anything at all to help out. They just pick a spot to perch and stay there the entire time and you cannot issue orders to them or anything like that. And a lot of the heists require you to be in multiple areas at the same time in order to successfully get things done. For example, in Shadow Raid heist, it is literally impossible to get the armor set out of the vault without an additional friend playing with you since it requires 2 keycards (and you can only have 1 at a time) and they need to be inserted at either end of the vault door simultaneously. Although getting it done with complete strangers is also pretty much impossible too since there's no screening process for complete noobs and cheating noobs from joining your game and failing the heist each and every single time and still not learning a damn thing from their mistakes. And then of course, there's the fact that you're limited to 4 zip ties for w/e dumb reason and there's always a lot of ppl to tie up in order to incapacitate them... so you end up having to resort to killing the rest which deducts profit from you. And if that wasn't bad enough... by default, you're only allowed 1 body bag, and with skills 2 body bags with the addition of having a place-able body bag kit which contains I think 3 more?... instead of having ECMs.  Doing the mission loudly, well... that's also an issue since the AI helpers are just basic meat shields as they don't come with any decent gear and barely do any damage at all to the authorities. They do pick you back up 'sometimes' when you fall down... if you're very lucky, but that's literally the extent of their purpose. And if you play on Overkill or Deathwish or any heist that has a mounted turret van shooting at us... the AI meatshields are so stupid, they just sit there in the open and absorb all the bullets till they fall down and expect you to try to revive them so they can continue to stand there and absorb the bullets again.  Playing the game online allows me to play on Deathwish and Overkill difficulties, and even then they're sometimes a bit too easy (depending who I play with and which heists and which modes). Playing offline however... Normal and maybe Hard difficulty are my only option, and even then, it's a pain in the butt that requires constant restarts.  The only reason I'm giving this game a positive review is because I can enjoy the game a lot while playing with other ppl. But I seriously hope that the devs someday work on getting much better AI into the game. And it's not just the AI helpers that are for the most part, useless... there's an obvious reason as to why they try to drown you with fully armored military cops shooting at you... it's because the AI is that terrible. The AI have no strategy what-so-ever, they just charge at you and accept all the bullets you give them. They don't even understand the concept of intimidation at all. They also spawn in way too quickly after the alarms are set off, etc... stupid things like that.  Basically, the stealth is great in this game as it's acceptably very difficult, and if you like being buried under heavy fire all the time for loud missions, then you'll love this game for sure.",

This is a fun as ♥♥♥♥ game, despite the very large amount of DLC available. The issue with microtransactions was the only thing stopping me from recommending it.   I've had a lot of fun with this game in the past, but I'll probably never play it again. {Edit - I did end up playing it again. It's still fun, but I already owned a bunch a bunch of critical DLC so I can just about get by.}  After stating in no uncertain terms that they wouldn't add microtransactions to a game already saturated with DLC, that's precisely what the developers have done.  It's not just cosmetics. Old items and abilities have been nerfed, so to work your way back even just to where you were before you'll need to pay real cash to open boxes for a  chance  to unlock what you need.  This is pay to win at its worst in a game that isn't free, and already has a tonne of DLC.  ♥♥♥♥ Starbreeze. ♥♥♥♥ Overkill.  Also ♥♥♥♥ Konami. ",

It has plenty of content to keep you interested, plus DLC if you want a little extra to add to gameplay experience. Rather than writing a wall of text, I shall do some pros and cons.  PROS:    Great stealth gameplay, with different tactics you can deploy    Loud gameplay is interesting, taking hostages, getting police to arrest themselves, guarding targets and much more!     Loads of guns and customization of weapons, masks and much more!    A nice progression system, not too fast or slow to level up plus rewards for levelling.    In-Depth skill and perk trees that affect your playstyle.    Interesting and different maps.    To play a DLC map only the host requires the DLC.  CONS:    Lots of DLC can make you want to buy a lot. Game also shows off the DLC every time you enter the inventory.    AI is quite stupid.    Due to the AI's stupidity, the game is only fun with friends.    Menus are not the easiest to navigate.    Constant Updates that take forever to install, generally adding new paid DLC and Microtransactions...    Microtransactions. I will explain this below.     Microtransactions   The system PAYDAY 2 uses is similar to that of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but as far as I know the premium weapons have additional stats, making the game somewhat pay to win. If that isn't bad enough, earlier in development the devs promised to never add microtransactions, but they did...     Score",

            "review_text": "payday 2. The story of how money can corrupt even the best of games. Me and my friends loved playing this game together, doing all the heists, getting the deathwish mask, unlocking new fun and exciting weapons, the joy of getting that sweet sweet cash to customize your masks and purchase weapon mods to improve your weapons for harder heists, it was great. Then, the game began to stray from its roots after the road to crimefest last year. Initially, the crew at overkill software had promised free updates regularly, which would add new weapons, masks, and heists for everyone for free, but now it seems instead of caring about the community they had grown to fame with, they decided to go down the corrupt business route, taking advantage of our wallets, killing the old community with microtransactions (something overkill software promised they would NEVER do), adding a new 5-10 dollar DLC pack what seemed like every week. They even had the balls to make shotguns and assault rifles ♥♥♥♥♥ weapons basically, and buff pistols up so they could be the most OP weapons in the game. It lost its payday charm. It lost the fun, of being able to enjoy a good heist with your friends, even if you hadnt bought any of the dlcs, payday was a great game once. It was my favorite game to play after getting off school or just any time i had free time. But, my friends and I had fallen out of the payday stage after the BBQ pack (the last cool one in my opinion). And had only recently returned to find our favorite game anally ♥♥♥♥♥ by the corporate corruption that eventually takes over every game. I hope most good games that actually care about their community NEVER go down the path payday went down. Instead I hope they go down the path payday couldve gone down, not ending in Microtransactions and DLCS for 6 bucks every week. I wish I could give this game a positive review, but i cant, its gone too far down the dark road of gaming, and im sad to say i think its lost there, and unless a miracle happens, i have to say goodbye to this old friend, and shoot the wankah that did this to this game. i would say dont act dumb overkill, but they have already made too many changes to make this game CSGO, now with heists. Goodbye payday crew. we'll always love what you used to be.",

So, yeah, I'm gonna have to revoke this recommendation. The game was great, but the addition of micropayments makes the prospect of playing it just gross now.  There's nothing quite like that feeling of satisfaction from completing a particularly lucrative heist and watching the loot roll in. Playing with folks online is pretty much essential, though; the friendly AI is... lackluster, at best, though they do make decent meat shields.  There's also the fact that Overkill is a fantastic game dev; they put their effort towards a legitimately GOOD GAME, and continue to put that effort towards great content, such as the great Big Bank Heist. Plus there's an insane number of weapons, mods and masks you can get, and a skill tree that upgrades you from a dude with a gun to a criminal MASTERMIND.  Pros: Fun co-op gameplay, great customization, amazing soundtrack, Overkill is an excellent dev that doesn't screw its customers Cons: Friendly AI is kinda crap, lots and LOTS of time fixing drills, civilian AI tends to run into line of fire and invoke Cleaner charges  Bottom line: Get it, get it, get it, and be sure to support the Overkill devs; encourage their business model of 'treat playerbase with respect'.",

Great game, Until they ♥♥♥ raped my wallet with dlc after dlc I was always buying the hiests and just flat out hosting them for my friends. That part I love I enjoy only one person needing to have bought a hiest for a group of four to enjoy it.  However.... now they have introduced a microtransaction system that allows you to get stats if you pay real money. Sad to say great game ruined by bad development choices. Adding skins is cool but having these paid skins only obtainable by real cash flat out turns it into a pay to win, And with all the paid dlc I have already bought from these guys I am just tired of spending so much on so little. So it gets my downvote.  Pros.   Great gameplay Engaging Hiests Fun with friends Good selection of weapons DLC's only need a friend for all to play  Cons  Lots of DLCs Has some networking issues that still have yet to be adressed New pay to unlock stats feature ruin it.  Buggy AI can ruin a Hiest Feels like I do not always get my moneys worth   Extra - More worth it if you can get the DLC's on a steam sale then it would be an upvote if you could snag it all for a cheaper price.   Still hate the microtransactions when they effect overall gameplay, If it just effected the look this would be an upvote.  (Edit 6/23/2016)   After they have removed all microtransactions I have to say I recommend this title.  They have made skill points free to refund which is a game changer... Some of the new hiests they have added are welcome additions... Not to mention the addition of First world bank. A map from PD1. Now only if they would add Mercy Hospitial. ;)",

I will continue to play from time to time, as long as I do not spend any more money. I have supported OVERKILL as a studio for a long time, but they have changed into something I currently resent.   There is a lot to like about this game. Repeatable enough so that you can get significantly better, but different enough with plenty of random geometry to keep you on your toes every single time.

You are spending 15564 dollars on a modification for your gun, but it feels like 30 bucks. You ear 47284833 dollars from a payday after a successful heist, but ir feels like a couple hundered or thousand, like if this was a day job.  The gun modification is just, beautiful, I might even say it rivals Fallout 4's. Wait, its exactly like it.  The gameplay is great. Many diffrent builds that can fit your playstyle. You can go all out and rampage on the swarms of cops you destroy, or silence your weapons and go stealth, and rob the place with no-one knowing.  So do I reccomend Payday 2? Yes. Its a very nice game.  But just, catch it on sale, It has alot of those, and everything gets cheap as hell.",

This is something which I can admire. I'm still disappointed due to the seemingly bad business model of DLC, and for the fact they allowed such an event take control in the first place. However, due to the removal of microtransactions, I can safely say Payday 2 is a good purchase once more. Happy heisting.   [Original Review] I stopped supporting this game around when they began releasing DLC on a weekly basis. With DLCs at price that totals around $100 with a base game price of $30, and now the 'cherry-on-top' micro-transactions, that they sworn would never make an appearance in-game, I can safely say that you should avoid this game like the plague. I encourage you to read the other highly rated negative reviews in order to get an in-depth analysis on the situation, but with a 100% certainty, avoid this game and any other game created by Overkill. They treat their fans with little respect as can be observed on their almost non-existant response to the negative outlash with the recent Crimefest and its horrid updates it has brought as well as the absolute horde of DLC that have been released. This is not the company they projected themselves to be years ago and, have yet to make any sort of amends for their actions. Avoid this game- in fact any Overkill product or merchandise at all costs.",

Yes the amount of paid for DLC and slight bias of pay to win can be frustrating; but if you get them in the deals it's a great value pack.   Yes earning XP and money can also take serious grinding and effort, but the customization and rewards ar satisfying.  But nothing beats pulling down a score in Deathwish with 3 others, running low on ammo and with little health remaining...  If you 'do' co-op, buy this game!",

Those who prefer strategy and stealth can attempt stealth missions, those who prefer loud shoot-'em-up's can do loud missions, and there's plenty in between.

EDIT: Overkill and Starbreeze as a company has garnered my respect. After buying back their company they have removed microtransactions all togeher ( a business practice used by the dodgy company 505) and made the black market free for all! In a day and age where several games including games developed by valve themselves push forward the $2 key crate opening gambling agenda, a company that will take a stand and say no, they refuse to do that to the gamers that support them, is a company that deserves your respect and your support. By making our voices heard on forums and using our wallets we made it clear we wouldnt support it, and because of it Starbreeze and Overkill listened and made a change for the better of not only their game but the gaming community as a whole and should be praised for it because no one else has the balls to do it.

Original Review: What a fantastic game. At the time of this review I have put 200 hours into it and I have enjoyed every minute of it.  The closest thing to PAYDAY 2 that I can think of is Left 4 Dead. The three major differences is that PAYDAY 2 typically doesn't involve Point A to Point B levels, almost every level can be stealthed, and your enemies are cops instead of zombies. When you are detected or thrown into a loud scenario the game will begin throwing waves of cops at you.  There is some variety among the cops. You have your normal beat cops that deal high damage but are easily killed with 1 or 2 shots. You have your armored SWAT cops that deal moderate damage but take more punishment. Then you have your 4 special cops. The Tazer is a cop... with a tazer. If you get tazed, you will be stunned and you will automatically pull the trigger on your gun. The Shield is a cop with a riot shield. Most weapons cannot penetrate the shield so teamwork or agility is required to take down a Shield. The Cloaker is a ninja cop. You do not want to let any Cloaker get close to you. Cloakers can jump on you and beat you down instantly in melee. The Bulldozer is a cop dressed in bomb disposal type body armor. Bulldozers deal insane amounts of damage and can only be effecively taken out by shooting their visor. Explosives help as well.",

'Guys the thermal drill go get it'. - Civillians run right into the middle of a gunfight and stand there like meat shields. - ALL Tasers played Buck Rodgers as kids. - you can be shot and knifed in a suit and not die but just ONE kick from sam fisher and you are completely ♥♥♥♥ed! - people refer to the payday gang as 'Clown ♥♥♥♥s'. - Cloakers ironically are the loudest unit in the game. - Your tax dollars go towards hiding dangerous criminals from other dangerous criminals. - you can yell get the ♥♥♥♥ up at someone who was just shot by a Light Machine Gun and they get up with no damage. - Civilians will call the police if i wear sunglasses. - Civilians will call the ploice if they hear a drill. - All guards be like 'CRACKED WINDOW??? better call the FBI'. - Civillians dont give a ♥♥♥♥ if you wear ballistic armor in public. - The FBI sucks at DNA scanning. - The rat who has information on the most notorious criminal gang in america is only guarded by SWAT.   *Overkill have removed microtransactions, so the review is back to positive for now*",

Are the DLCs worth the money? Maybe not. I used to buy all of them, but they've lost some of my trust so I don't know if I'll ever pay more for this game again.    (1 like) As of October 15 2015, this game's weapon balancing is terrible. This game is not worth it until they fix it, and everything else. I can't even begin to explain everything that's wrong with PD2 right now. I'm going to cry in a corner now because I never thought I'd say this, but don't buy this game. Not until they fix it.. if they fix it.  June 21 2015: (1 dislike) One of my favourite games hands down! Lots of replayability value since I'm a perfectionist and there are many ways to do a single mission: stealth or loud, and any kind of playstyle is possible. The frequent updates and new stuff is great and the playerbase is large enough that you won't have any problems finding a game in multiplayer co-op.   I found the learning curve a bit higher since I like to play solo, and you get nothing if you fail a heist which means stuck at noob level. :X But once you get past that, the game really is a lot of fun.  Beware! Once you go PD2 you never go back to PD. So if you're planning on getting both, play PD first 'cause that game's also hella fun.  10/10 would buy again.  ",

I mean who will be so stupid to buy stuff whats already in your game but not activated?  Changing my Review since it hasn't gotten any better.",

And then the October 2015 Crimefest event happened. You know what a $20 game, with approximately $100 of DLC, needs? A Microtransaction economy to let our players have rainbow paint jobs on their guns for more dosh, thats also pretty much copy pasted from CSGO. And you know what , We should also release it during the community event that promised free content affter we had the community spend a few hundred hours grinding arbritary objectives to unlock said content. And hey for the free content part of a update, lets do a weapon rebalance about as balanced as an anvil is to a feather. And since they're going to let us get away with all of that, lets also make the weapon skins add statistic bonuses just to remove all doubt that we were trying squeeze our target market's wallets with P2W dlc. Crimefest indeed.   P.S: CSGO did it better. It's aleady a complete game at $15, with the cosmetics 100% optional and have absolutely no effect on gameplay.",

With the newest update adding in microtransactions, which Overkill said time and time again would never be implemented, this game just feels like a Pay-2-Pay game (play on of Pay-2-Win, you see?). The company has been focusing more on creating DLC to rob its fans rather than fixing bugs or adding in features promised long ago. I honestly have to drop my rating of this game from a prestigious 9.5/10 to a 4/10. It's very unfortunate, because the game truly is a great game. It's just riddled with diseases and needs a cure asap.  ~~THE REVIEW BELOW IS NO LONGER VALID~~ ~~SEE ABOVE RESPONSE~~  Do you ever get the craving to go into a bank, throw on an anime mask of a young Japanese girl with purple and blue hair, pull out an arsenal of firearms, and shoot up the place with your friends? No? Then you and I won't be getting along well. Payday 2 is an amazing successor to its prequel (Payday: The Heist). Notable differences include: 1. More missions. 2. More RPG elements. 3. More guns. And, well, more everything.  Payday 2 is an online co-op multiplayer first person shooter that involves multiple tasks ranging from performing a B&amp;E to cooking methamphetamine. Almost everything is customizable, from the masks to the guns. Each mission has many different ways to be taken care of, whether you choose to be stealthy or go in loud and proud-- it's totally your decision.  So, yeah, Payday 2. One of the greatest games on Steam currently. Grab it while you can. 9.5/10",

We check out the floor plans and pay off the security guy for access to the camera feed. Hoxton brings a couple of body bags in case things get messy. Chains grabs a few ECM jammers...they should come in handy. I'm on Ammo and Wolf brings a ton of extra ammo. We park across from the museum and I hit the roof and tap into the camera feed. Chains and Hoxton drop into the museum exhibit and ghost the guard. They toss the body bag up and Wolf hides it out back. Chains and Hox avoid the cameras and grab the marked paintings and we stash em in the van. Then, they give the signal and we ice the rest of the guards before the alarm trips. We're out and on our way before the cops even show up.  Day 2, We hit the rail yard looking for our contact. He calls us on a dropped burner phone. We exchange the paintings for duffel bags of loot. It's a good day. On our way to the van, we're ambushed by the cops. We fight our way through the warehouse to the Van. Chains goes back for a bag we left behind. He gets downed so we break out. No bonus today boys...just glad to have escaped.  Day 3, Chains made it out somehow...Good to have him back. Bain tells us there's a Senator that needs framing. We need to break in, snag some information and plant evidence for the frameup. There's big money in this job. It's heavily guarded and cops are on standby if anything happens. We meet on the roof of the building next door. I slide over and catch a guard by surprise.. The pansy nearly wet himself as I was cuffing him with his own cuffs. We move down stairs and swipe his phone, hard drive, laptop and a few others. Chains runs them back to the roof for re-programming. Wolf slips into the Senator's study and starts hacking his computer. Idiot almost got seen by the snooping neighbor next door. Finally the hack is finished and we just need to find the vault. Sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hid it behind a book case. We move in, slip the laser security and fill up with the Senators gold. We fire brigade the gold to the roof and Bain drops in bags of coke. Says to put it in the vault and our job is done. We slip in and out of the remaining guards like ninjas. Drop the coke in the safe and we disappear. Job well done boys.",

Payday 2 brings back the original band of professional burglars in search for heists bigger and better than ever. While the storyline appears to be relatively unsatisfying, the action and the emphasis on cooperation continues to shine. Players are put to ultimate test of skill and survival as they pull off the robbery, while trying to avoid the law.  Payout system is drastically different from the first game. Players can now spend their earnings on skills, weapons, accessories, and even mask customization. Items are unlocked at random by picking one of the cards in the end of each successful heists, and they require a hefty sum of cash to apply them to the player's loadout.  While the game seems to be occasionally glitchy, it still give players a very fun and intense experience for many hours to come. Be sure to play with real players, since the computer-controlled bots are very incompetent.  (As of October 16, 2015) - It was understandable to have multiple small DLCs as 'options' for those who want to opt in for more content, but as of today, Payday 2 has finally reached it's all-new low.  Overkill decided to ♥♥♥♥ the entire playerbase by introducing microtransaction Pay-to-win aspects with Crimefest. Sure, this ♥♥♥♥ would have been fine if the game was free in the first place. Weapons were rebalanced to dirt unless you have legendary RNG loot from cracking open rare safes, by buying a unique drill with REAL money.  Well, let's see what happens are Crimefest.

Overkill not only decided to insult their fans by introducing an f2p model on the first day of Crimefest - an event that the community grinded its way through on the promise of free content - indicating that we, the community, WORKED SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT GOAL (since it has the icon of the very last task the community had to finish). they also decided to completely butcher the model.  so, two things: - the safes/crates/chests/cases drop on a timer, negating other possible card drops after finishing a heist, so it actively ♥♥♥♥s you over. - there's no trading. - the keys - or 'drills' - can only be bought on the Market. - the cosmetic skins ALTER THE STATS OF YOUR WEAPONS.  and that last thing is the absolute worst thing.  see, I'm not a fan of the f2p model in games you already pay for. it can work - CS:GO's is ultimately inconsequential in any way - but it has to be done smartly. this is not it. this is pure pay2win. and this is pay2win after Overkill members, including current producer and 'community manager' Almir Listo and former lead designer David Golfarb promised that they'll never introduce something like that.  this is lying. this is abusing your community.  so no, I don't recommend Payday 2. not anymore. not right now.",

            "review_text": "----UPDATE: Honestly I loved this game enough to buy most of the truely rediculas amount of dlc, but now they add in microtransactions? I feel like that might be a step too much.  This game is all about pulling off epic hiests, including robbing banks, rigging elections, causing general mayhem and much more.  When you first start this game, most hiests often turn into a giant shoot-out. Once you figure the game out a bit more or get people/friends who know whats up, it gets more complex and interesting. The game offers plenty of challange levels to suit any players comfortable difficulty, though the rewards for the higher difficulties are much greater and require greater skill or knowledge of mechanics. It also has a class/perk system and a ton of different weapon options/mods to suit many different playstyles.   However, I feel like the game does get repetative after awhile if you don't mix the hiests a lot. Also it feels like often there is really only two ways to play, heavy or stealth. The higher difficulty missions almost feel like you have to stealth or have the perfect group set up. These difficulties are appropriatly named Overkill and Deathwish for a reason, but I often feel like they are almost too challanging somtimes without gimmicks or stealth.  Last of all there is a lot of DLC. Personally I've always been mixed on the whole games having dlc thing, so I know that can be a bit of a turn off. Luckily mission wise you can do any dlc mission with a host who owns the dlc, but you will still miss out on additional weapons/masks.  In my opinion it's one of the most innovative and interesting coop games I've played. I would say it's worth getting if you enjoy shooting, coop games, and mechanics not seen in other games.",

            "review_text": "Until recently, I have been a supporter of this game, and of Overkill. However, over the last, I want to say 3-4 months Overkill have made some incredibly bad business decisions.  I may well be in the severe minority here when I say that I'm not against the microtransactions as a whole, I'm just against them affecting the stats of guns. Honestly, if there wasn't any incentive to pay more money to get better stats on a gun, then there wouldn't be as much community uproar. My simple message to OVK regarding this: Remove the stat boosts on them, and I'll be happy.  DLC is where we get to my main issue with this game. 10 characters, half of which, you have to pay extra money to either Overkill, or the developers of another game, to access. And not only that, but they are ludicrously overpriced for what you're getting with the packs. Yes, I understand that the voice acting for new characters isn't cheap, but if you're going to charge that much for the character packs, at least give us something better than the character, 1 gun and a melee weapon. it's not enough that you're already bleeding the community dry with your other Weapon Packs that you have to do the same with new characters. While I'm still on the subject of characters, why the hell are there 10 available characters, but we can still only have 4-player co-op? If you're going to keep adding characters, please for the love of god, let us have more people in a lobby, otherwise it just seems pointless. Yes, we get more chance of playing as the character we want to, but honestly, I'd rather play with more of my friends at the same time. Additionally, the B-Sides soundtrack hasn't been updated since it was released (although it has been confirmed there is an update in the works) but the Official Soundtrack DLC hasn't been updated since the Hoxton Revenge heist, which was months ago, I understand that updating things may be a little time consuming when you're busy creating weapon skins, but there has to be a point where you realise that you need to start taking care of your players by updating the content they already have. A final word on Payday 2's DLCs. Stop with the constant charges for DLC, 75% of your game, and 100% of the things that make the game worth playing, are locked behind your absurd paywall at this point. And your community have had enough of it. Something needs to change Overkill.  Finally, we get onto actual gameplay. This hasn't changed since I first started playing the game 2 years ago. The mechanics still feel identical, and the only thing that's really changed dramatically is the addition of driveable vehicles. Some of the more recent heists are riddled with bugs and issues, the AI is still as horrible to both fight against and alongside as the day I first played, and the 'Weapon Balance' patch as part of Crimefest 2015 completely destroyed all weapon balance, completely removing any point to using a shotgun, and punishing anyone that didn't have either a Deagle or a Bronco as their secondary. If there's one thing people hate in a game like Payday 2 where there is such a wide array of weaponry to choose from, it's being forced to select certain weapon types. Additionally, there are some incredibly annoying issues with Desync in this game, 90% of the entire game is based on HOST CLIENT DETECTION. Meaning that if you aren't host, then bodies and NPCs aren't where you see them. Thus rendering half of the entire game (anything stealth related) ineffective, as you spend half your time sitting around doing nothing while the host solo stealths the mission, or restarting heists because someone shot a guard that wasn't where they thought he was. The desync in this game is on par with GTA V's online lobbies in some cases.  If I'm completely honest, GTA V is a better game right now, simply because the 5 heists that GTA:O has are more interesting than all of Payday 2's combined, and the DLC for GTA is completely free.  Long story short, I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone until Overkill impliment some serious changes and actually start listening to their community. I've given this company enough of my money, but not so much that I'm adverse to cutting my losses and uninstalling.  Overkill, if you happen to read this, myself, and other members of this community you have are willing to give you another chance, but you have to start fixing your mistakes, instead of offering half-hearted apologies for the sake of apologising.",

From the eargasmic weapon sounds to the awesome soundtrack. -Amazing customization, from fitting weapons with various attachments to making your own masks and expressing your inner criminal. -Various skilltrees to adapt your character according to your playstyle as you go. -Content is still put on this on a regular basis so you won't ever sense any kind of repetition during your sessions.  What you may want to now: -This is the game with THE MOST DLC I have ever seen. If you are one of those that has to have the full thing, then watch out because this is gonna hit your wallet pretty hard. The bright side is that the dlc weapons don't seem to be ludicrously overpowered as you would expect. -In order to have attachments on your weapon and materials/colours for your mask, you have to unlock them at the end of any successfull heist on a totally RNG drop, and then, if you want to equip an attachment, you still have to buy it.  Why you may not want to buy it: -At this point, starting from scratch involves being kicked time and time again by the 'pros' at least until you are level 40. -It is practically impossible to pull off a full stealth heist offline with bots. They can only help with shooting and healing, so don't waste money if you are not playing online. -There are way to many cheaters, It may not sound bad as this is a coop only game, but going from 1000 to 1000000000 because some guy kept spamming loot bags into the escape van or having all the NPC on the level die to make stealth a walk in the park, takes all the fun from the game. -The serverlist is confusing. Instead of a proper list with all the information you need, you are shown a top-down image of the city with pop-ups appearing randomly on it.

You really have to think and pick your battles carefuly, moreso on the higher difficulties. However, playing on your own can be a very frustrating experience and for one reason alone.  Your AI crew (and some of the AI in general) is bad. So, so, so bad. I mean really bad. Okay, sometimes it'll all work out, but...they're no good! They can shoot, but that's it. Their pathfinding sucks, resulting in many downs (first or otherewise) meaning failure because they're too busy staring at you and trying to shoot at a cop through the wall to pick you up. Or they turn their backs on enemy targets and get downed without helping you. It can be massively frustrating. I understand that you want people to play together, that's fine. But making the AI bad or randomly fail themselves (as me and my friends call it 'going potato') after a decent running battle will make more people give up on the game.  The orginal game, the AI could not complete tasks. That was fine, though. If anything, they should have upped the ante on this game. Still not allow them to complete tasks on their own, but allow us to give them bags, or a chance for them to fix a drill, or somthing! The hostage pathfinding is terrible too, with many failed stealth missions because of it.  Also, this game seems to have more than it's fare share of bugs, with apparent x-ray guards/cops and stability issues. No game is perfect, but come on!  Despite my complaints, can I reccomend the game? Yes. If you get a group of friends together and learn the maps, set up your weapons and work together, you can have so much fun. Even alone, you can get a few missions where the AI can help. The flaws are annoying. But the game itself is intresting enough to hold my attention at least.  P.S: FREE OLD HOXTON!

The gameplay was solid, and there wasn't a feel of grinding even if you did the same heists over and over. The first few DLCs people turned a blind eye to, knowing that a little extra was bound to happen, and accepted it. Everything was perfect, and Overkill really delivered.  After a few months after release, I stopped playing due to issues in real life happening. When i came back, the amount of DLCs this game had could rival The Sims 3. I read up on the update notes and played some matches, realising that microtransactions were a thing now and the whole safe drops with skins that buffed guns completely went against what Overkill was striving for before release.  I really loved this game, to the point of playing it everyday when i had the chance. Now Overkill is really just a money vacuum, waiting for new players to fall into the DLC traps. I didn't explain about the whole changes in-depth, but I'm sure there are plenty of other reviewers willing to share their experience with you. i can't tell you what to do, but I can advise : Don't support Overkill, and don't buy this game, until Overkill gets their ♥♥♥♥ together.

It's in the UI and menus that you notice a great difference. They are slicker and more userfriendly. But, at least in my opinion, 'Payday 2' feels a lot like a refinement rather than a sequel. That's not to say it doesn't inovate.   The upgrade in graphical quality is very nice, but even if you play the game on the highest setting possible you will still notice some graphical bugs and sometimes the framrate drops. But it is a fun and thrilling action co-op game that relies heavily on team work. One uses the drill to crack the safe while the others protect him or her from enemy fire and takes out cameras. You can either go in stealthy or guns blazing. In any case, a heist usually ends in a gunfight. That isn't bad, rather the contrary but it might get boring after a while. As it stands, 'Payday 2' is fun and thriling in short bursts, but as your game session closes in on the 2 hour mark, you, or at least I, feel kind of bored and spends more time customizing my character than actually playing heist.

Game has stealth option for many missions, but going in guns blazing, granades flying, cops dying is always an option.  It has a decent character progression through four different skill trees. The player is not limited to one tree, and can open various perks from all 4 trees. There is a weapon modification system that allows you to customize your weapons to suit your playstyle.  Only major complaints about the game are the present scify features in form of a cloaker police unit that will suddenly appear and take you down with a single hit of a batton, regardless of your health, armor, perks, or anything else; and the everpresent hackers who ruin your enjoyment of the game by cheating the number of guards you can kill before alarm is triggered, or the fact that the police has a no-show once alarm is activated.  Other than this, the game is fun.  EDIT: Considering the recent DLC work of Overkill, I rescind my review and give it a thumbs down.

During the Hype Train event they offered a $20 COMPLETELY OVERKILL pack, the the details of which would be released later. Today they announced what was unlocked and it was one skin. A ♥♥♥♥ING SKIN FOR $20 THAT IS PURELY COSMETIC, NO STAT OR TEAM BOOSTER. That's a load of horse ♥♥♥♥, Overkill. I was fine with the skins being in the game, and I liked how you offered the safes and the drills as drops so you don't have to buy with money but this is the last straw. You also gave the people who bought the COMPLETELY OVERKILL pack 7 free DLC. Cool, that dope but anyone who bought the COMPLETELY OVERKILL pack probably owns ALL THE DLC ALREADY MAKING THIS USELESS.

It has a talent system, and lots of weapon customisation. It is worth noting, that there is alot of dlc packs, and you might miss out if you dont get one or too dlc packs. That said it is still very much playable without the dlc packs, and you arn't restricted, to play any new maps.  The community is great, and you will most likely find new friends through the game. But the real fun wont really start before you can play with people you know, and make strategies with them. So if you are going in the game alone, it might not be worth buying if you arn't 100% that you will enjoy this game.

But more than that, there was a feeling of trust between me, as a player, and the developers, who seemed to do a lot for the game and make it as good as they can.  But now things have changed. Overkill probably figured out what a cashcow they have in their hands, and gave up on all of the things that made this game so good for the sake of earning more. Tons of DLCs came out at ridiculous prices, Microtranscations of paid skins that boost stats(!!) were implemented, balance was ignored completely to focus on more paid content - basically everything I loved about this game turned into a one massive cash-grab. Sure, the game is still playable and can sometimes be fun, but it's so much harder to love it after seeing what the developers turned it into.  I loved PAYDAY 2. It was one of my favourites. And it's so sad for me to see it turning into what it is today. But what was done cannot be undone. I do not recommend this game anymore. I'm sorry.",

I purchased all of the DLC's and bought the completely overkill pack to support the developers and they have decided to reduce all accuracy and specs of the guns so the players will accumulate drop cards of safes which they can’t open unless they spend around $2.50 US for a drill!

I kept playing however as it is still a fun game. However after today's update which not only does not adress the massive issues introduced, but even adds more microtransactions with benefits I cannot reccomend buying this game, and I intend to not play it until things are properly managed again, which considering the company's behavoir I doubt will ever happen. EDIT 6/3/2016 ...They actually fixed it. Overkill accquired the full rights to Payday, and then removed the paid microtransactions. I am extremely pleasantly suprised by this. Not only did they remove the microtranactions but they released a skill tree ovrehaul that breathes frehs life into the game. Welcome back Payday 2, I am so happy to see you again.",

            "review_text": "Payday 2 Where do you begin?  The game itself is a work of art, compared to the first game (payday: The Heist), this game is a masterpiece but in a stand alone game it laked a few things. with what seems like a new payday coming whenever overkill decides I figured it was time to review it, so after 350-ish hours it's time to tell people about the payday experince.  Gameplay: honestly if you got friends this game is the bomb, the way you can work with your friends to pull off jobs as simple as breaking stores in a mall or jobs that are honestly bada** like breaking into military strongholds or robbing moving trains. this gameplay keeps players interested for hours and hours of fun, and if your friends aren't around there is always a new challenge out there, try stealhing something that will keep you entertained for sure.  Community: There is no sugar-coating it, Payday 2 has one of the worst communities on steam, the high levels are a**holes 'Pros' and the low levels struggle to even pay attention to objectives like 'walk inside' it seems like there isnt a happy medium between the two. When joining a public the best recommendation is: Just don't. it's actually horrible, many people don't talk to each other and the jobs go bad really fast or you get stuck with the script kiddies, who will hack the game and ruin the fun for everyone.  DLC: Buy the game for sure, it's tons of fun and you'll love it! but having bought most DLC I would recommend you dont do the same. The DLC can be played on any pub (which also isnt recommended) and also makes you pay 7$ (CAD) for 1-2 heists every pack, some packs just make you buy the pack just for a character and some skins or guns, not worth it one bit.  AI: The AI is one of the worst parts of the game to be frank. the way the bots will start a task such as picking up the player then abonden it for no reason and leave the host or any player for that fact to just bleed out and go into custody is just so stupid. bots get shot from all angles at all times and never seem to even get hurt by the bullets that is of course until one of them needs to help you out then they will take one hit and fall down without even yelling for help. I hope you dont plan to do any stealth missions with friends because Desync will screw you so hard, whoever isnt host will see a guard and hide but that guard will see the player from 13 miles away and call it in pretty fast.   Rating: 7/10 (Needs some work for sure)  (Dont get upset about the number, im not an actual reviewer just a professional Dumba**)",

            "review_text": "In lieu of my former most recent immature pissy review, this is my attempt on a more fair review for a game that deserves it. I will discuss the pros of the game that I praise, the cons of some things that should be improved, the grade I would rate Payday 2, and my final overall opinion.  My first pro is the varying style of gameplay with several different missions. A handful of missions can only be stealthed, several can only be played loud, and a few of them can be done either tactic. This definitely is something that I didn't expect in a shooter, I expected guns blazing 100% of the time but there is definitely a learning curve to the alternate tactics of approaching different jobs.  Secondly on the thought of variety; enemies. There are a plethora of enemies that are fought depending on difficulty level, each with their own gimmicks and health values that may force you to change your approach on them, i.e. keeping your distance from cloakers, laying waste on bulldozer visors, flanking shields, etc.. Additionally, the ability to call out and mark special enemies makes it much easier for teams to strategize during the game.  Lastly with pros; skill trees. They killed it here with the most recent update. It feels like I'm playing an RPG shooter and I can spec my character however I want. In the five trees you can mix and match whatever points you want to make your heister as badass as you want. In addition to the skill trees are the perk decks. These I'm a little more mixed on, some are amazing, some are semi-viable/situational, and some are pure garbage in all circumstances. I will give credit though they all CAN have their uses depending on your playstyle and the difficulty.  Now with the cons.. recent updates have potentially caused me some ire but I have been able to play the game without too much keyboard destruction lately.  Firstly, and I know a lot of people have complaints and will say 'eh just keep your distance'...; Cloakers. For sure I understand why overkill added Cloakers to gameplay, it's literally a curveball to your normal playing style (I enjoy high risk/high reward so it may be my own problem) and for a melee oriented/shotgun built character cloakers can be a bit of a hassle for someone who plays like me. Regardless, my big issue is their kick hitbox. It is broken, I have been hit from across the map from a cloaker who was 'chasing me' for about 10-15 seconds then I randomly end up being downed. In spur of the moment it makes me furious but I've gotten to the point where I accept cloakers are broken and I can live with it but I like complaining about it :P  Secondly, stealth mechanics. I originally loved these jobs. They were quite the change of pace from loud jobs. My friends and I would play Framing Frame all day to learn stealth and get the added benefit of a experience stealth bonus. I miss being able to play FF multiplayer like I did several months ago. The addition of the most recent update seriously messed up connection. Desync, while originally prevelant only occasionally, happens quite possibly 80% of the time playing stealth missions, which has recently discouraged me from playing the stealth jobs I used to love playing with my friends.  Thirdly and my biggest issue with the game is the DLC content. I know people will complain about microtransactions, and I'm guilty of it myself while I use some skins in-game, but DLC's are really where the game bothers me. A game like Skyrim has three DLC's that add entirely new content, storylines, characters, quests and even more. Each for a reasonable price for what they offer. For Payday however, some of the perk decks available really give a player the edge or a deficit depending on which one you use, and a ton of them are only available as DLC's. Granted, I will give credit to steam for having sales often throughout the year lowering the price by as much as 75%, but the sheer number of DLC's available start to become a little pricy for someone with modest means of income.  I will give this game a B grade.  While very fun and addicting, Payday 2 has its problems like any game. But with a good group of friends to play with, a generally considerate and friendly community, and a multitude of missions to play either alone or with a group, overall this is a game I would recommend playing.",

Payday 3 was announced anyways, so let's just wait and see.  ---------------------------------- Original:  I've never changed recommendation on a game so much. I actually didn't like vanilla Payday 2 when it launched. For me it was buggy and nowhere near as good as Payday 1. In Payday 1 you robbed the enormous First World Bank! Here? You had a little one at the corner of a streeet... meh. There was no heist with a big enough fight. Only improvement compared to Payday 1 was the stealth part of the game. I stopped playing after a couple of hours  Then Overkill started pushing out free updates and DLC. I didn't particularly like the overpriced DLC, but at least we finally had big-a$$ fights! We had the big bank heist. We had Hoxton Breakout. We finally had proper sniper rifles and shotguns. We had a new difficulty. This was when I really started playing the game and it was probably during this period I instantly put 100 hours of my limited time into this game. I played it as much as I could.  And payday was getting even better! Miniguns, RPGs, vehicles, the nuke heist, a cool background story regarding Hoxton, Xmas Heist, John Wick. Payday was at it's best!  Then sadly Overkill got bought by a larger company. I believe that was in spring 2015. To no ones surprise some of peolpe instantly left the company. Even Simon Viklund (music, voice of Bane) and one of the leads.  Crimefest is probably the effect of that decision. Microtransaction, skins with stats, pay2win. Time to give this game the red hand again.",

No actual bank robbing games out there like PD2. The skills are nice the community is nice and it's a game where hacking can't really ruin it because there is no penalty for leaving a lobby.  The reason I no longer recommend this game is because Overkill is just milking the PD2 franchise by coming up with ridicoulus ways for making more connent for people to buy and play, they've just released a goat sim. DLC and the on before it was chivalry/medevil stuff and those two DLCs have now sparked this review.  Instead of milking all the money they can from PD2 they should be focusing they're resources onto making Payday 3 with some story, interesting new character, new city, no more bain, new banks and maps. Keep the skills people or make new skill tree people would like even more, something I would like is if you had to play a certain character to have a certain skill tree.  Just a newer engine would even be nice newer games are starting to stomp all of the PD2 AI and the dysnc on PD2 is crazy compared to some new games. So all, in all make a Payday 3 instead of squezing all of the money that you can from PD2.  I rate this game (BEFORE THE DLC MONEY GRAB) a 11/10 now with all of these idiotic DLCS the game is now a -11/10. PD3 we want you now.",

Game is been updated several times with FREE dlc and have released paid dlc. Even if you don’t own the dlc as long as the host does you can play the new maps which is amazing. The developers of payday 2 do several AMA's and are very friendly. Highly recommend this game if you don't already own it.  EDIT: Still a good game after 500 hours only complain in the # of dlc. EDIT2: Lied to community officially went microtransactions even thought stated it would NEVER happen #uninstall #boycott #PAY2DAY #YOUJUSTDUN♥♥♥♥EDUP EDIT3: Currently overkill/505 is digging a hole deeper than Activision, EA and Ubisoft combined. In the recent update they added in the COKP items to the game and they are all skins that HIGHLY EFFECT GAMEPLAY. Items were to be deemed as cosmetic only. EDIT4: !@#$ YOU 505, YOU GUYS ARE GONE AND HOPEFULLY THE DOORS HITS YOU ON THE WAY OUT! Bye bye microtransactions and hello my old love :3",

I will have to give Payday 2 another chance to see, I have heard good things about it now.  EDIT 2: Payday is back lads! IGNORE THE BELOW!  Don't get me wrong, I got into Payday 2 this year and loved it. It was fun, if a little rough at the edges. But I cannot condone a company going back on its promises and adding microtransactions in addition to the boatload of DLC. I could handle the DLC, even if there was a lot of it, but I feel that to buy the game now would be to support a company that screws over their fanbase so much. To go from 'shame on you for thinking we would ever have microtransactions' to 'yep microtransactions' without even a word on why is unforgivable.  The game is still fun, though I am not mad on the gunplay changes as of a couple of days ago, and I still love it, but Overkill really screwed the pooch in the name of money - ripping a few models from Chivalry and rigging them to flog for £4 I could accept, but not going back on promises and chucking in microtransactions that affect weapon stats. (and due to the card draw nature of safes, means you have LESS chance of getting a weapon mod, something that already wound me up)",

Unfortunately, in the last few days, Overkill have released an update which introduces microtransactions into the game, despite saying repeatedly since before lauch, I quote, 'We've made it clear that Payday 2 will have no microtransactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)'. We've seen OK make mistakes before, (the John Wick movie tie-in being an especially annoying addition) but this is the straw which breaks the camel's back. Payday used to be a wonderful game, with incredible long term support, (until 2017!) transparent devs, and an incredible community.  ----------  I'm not sure what it is, but this game keeps me coming back for more. A fantastic co-op shooter, most fun I've had in months. 10/10",

This game has a lot of experimentation, and the actual gunplay itself is pretty interesting while doing all that, and seeing how all this stuff affects the playstyles. As stated before, there are a lot of heists, and each one is really fun and replayable, which is pretty much the big point of this game, to replay all the heists and get better with them, and it does well at that.  Now, the big problem with this game (and why a lot of old fans of the series don't recommend it) is that Overkill has promised support for this game up until like 2016, and what they've done since after the first couple of updates is just put weapon packs or character packs and be done with it. I really don't like these either, but they're not *that* intrusive (not ignoring this, it's dumb to do) until you start noticing that they're not adding other content because of it, and the original content gets old after the first couple of times playing them (which is not even remotely comparable to Payday 1's replayability in the heists, where you couple probably play each over 10 times and still not get bored). After a while, people pretty much finish all of the really interesting content and start to notice that the game's boringly repetitive, and stop liking the game and be done with it. That's really fine, but this game almost always has you play up until a point where you just stop entirely with the game.  Overall, this game's a blast to play over a break or during the school year or whenever, but after you start getting into about a hundred hours, the game's fun starts to deteriorate and the game seems worse. All of Overkill's content additions have been almost exclusively weapon packs, which really takes away from the good heists, which they don't seem to add. This game has a really finite amount of fun content, and it's nice to hit it and be done with the game, but you shouldn't play after that.  EDIT: After Crimefest 2015, I honestly can't recommend this game anymore. They promised not to ♥♥♥♥♥ DLC like all other AAA companies, but they did it anyway. All of the rewards were worthless, and they almost literally copied CS:GO's announcement of skins. Don't get this game, if for no other reason, to not give these greedy devs any money.  EDIT EDIT: the issues have been fixed, the things they added are no longer direct pay to win garbage, and they've been working to make actual good content like before.",

Third point, missions. Nowadays there're more than 20 i think, including dlc and the original ones. So its impossible to get bored when u always have to do something different.

Let me tell you why:  You can choose to go either loud or stealth in a mission, which is a refreshing choice for shooter standards and the preplanning is amazing Missions are very diverse and offer lots of fun and epic moments For those who like to customize assets of a character, the mask customization will satisfy your needs You really feel part of the action in missions Stealth is simply marvelous, but INCREDIBLY unrealistic (run into people using harry potter dust and don't get spotted) Soundtrack is the crème de la crème of shooters Skill trees and perk decks are amazing Special enemies are always fun especially on Deathwish (Cloakers galore)  However the sun doesn't always shine:  This game has it's past of releasing dlc after dlc which can drive one crazy, yet if you just wait and buy them cheap in sales there's no problem. However, the game feels unfinished after you buy them. It adds way more to the game then just the plain version. This is getting better as Overkill has released a few more basic items.  Missions got boring for me and there aren't a lot of maps. Then again I have played 400+ hours now so that comes as no surpise. But our good friend Overkill releases plenty of maps in dlc packs. Also there are, as master Hoxton would say, plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥s online. Clowns who kick you right before the end or if you don't please them or they don't like you for whatever reason you better start packing your stuff.  The mask customization is good, if you have the right color/pattern/material. To get this you have go in a vegetative state of grinding and no-lifing mission (I suggest the good 'Ol Jewelry store, emc rush b edition).  I missed some things, but I think I did a decent job discribing the game. Now don't get me wrong by thinking I go way more into detail on the cons of this game. I love this game and now that Overkill has the full rights to the game I see a bright future ahead (black market update still haunts my dreams). If you like shooters this is a must have for sure!",

Well you're right you don't but you miss out on some of the biggest things such as; new guns, new masks, new maps, and new everything pretty much. In addition with the DLC's combine they basically cost double than the actual game price which may seem stupid  2. SKINS, Paid Skins now this is probably one of the most annoying inventions to the game. And no i dont mean the skins but how you have pay for it. So i can color my mask and design in anyway i want but i cant color and design my gun without paying real money and its not even how i wanted to design it???  3. GAME DEVELOPING, now it seems like Paday 2 developers are not focusing on the bugs, textures, and style anymore but rather focusing on new content, new weapeons, and new masks THAT ARE ALL FKEN PAID DLC'S. Bugs so as cloakers going through walls, Tazers tazing you through walls, Shields now auto lock on you so you cant get them from behind, and snipers that shoot you as soon as they spawn and give no hints to where they are unless you've memorized the map. Also DESYNC is another major problem, 1 second a officer is running fine Next Second hes running 100mph.  {Pros} 1. 4 player co op which makes stealthing and loud operations exciting and fun  2. There's a lot of things to do in it such as , cooking meth, stealing cars and driving away, shooting cops down, robbing small to large banks, stealing guns, too a whole variety.  3. Custimization in mask and modifications to guns make the game feel what you enjoy  4. Variety of guns to use (However you need so many DLC'S)  5. Incredible action packed with Pistols to LMGS to Snipers to RPGs to Molotovs to Miniguns( which are all in mind DLCS)  6. You can get that really cool teamwork set up with friends such as one friends can be the 'Heavy' one can be the 'Medic' and one could be the 'Technician' which all adds that fun realistic set to ones mind.

Solo stealth play works sometimes better than with friends, mainly because of desync (guards can see clients through walls from their point of view and such), but playing solo means you'll have less leeway on how you use your body bags and ecms, since each player can bring them to the heist.  Same thing with playing loud, instead of max 8 ammo bags/medkits, you'll only get 2 (not to mention trip mines and ecms).  The desynced clients issue doesn't really affect loud play.

Impressive to consider that the former director and former EA employee was the one preventing this degeneration until he left.  I feel I should further elaborate. Over the years, strange decisions slowly came to light. Crimefest, public event which hosts a string of free updates, was culminated by the addition of John Wick; a nonsensical assassin from an unrelated film added as a poorly made character. He is not voiced by Keanu Reeves of course, but some strange imitation. Also provided alongside him had been the dual wielding feature, which was unfortunately poorly programmed, like a shoddily made weapon from a GMOD modder. As a final aspect to that particular note in the game, if the community had not achieved the community goal during said crimefest, John Wick would have been a paid DLC, despite being funded as an advertisement by the company that produced the film to begin with.  Following this, other traits of development began to become more prevalent. DLC was always a sticking point for many, but in some cases it was justified in the level of content it provided. That level of content slowly lowered over time however, whilst in some cases the cost of the DLC rose. With the release of the Diamond Heist, its associated character 'Clover' was sold separately, splitting the DLC in twain into two packs.  Programming does not seem to be Overkill's forte. The game was produced on the Diesel engine, used for former games such as Flatout and Bionic commando. Despite being their own engine however, the company cannot produce driving physics to even the vaguest degree of pleasantness, let alone gameplay. Any driving in the game is frequently avoided in the few heists that allow it. There are no leg and arm hit boxes, although one modder created them within the space of one afternoon. Multiple sights, underbarrel attachments... they seem to stalwartly ignore potential improvements. Flashbangs merely spawn into existence and are not thrown by any particular enemy, for example.   I will not go into detail regarding the weapon skins, as many others have. I merely wanted to explain that my negative review is a culmination of poor decisions and effort in Overkill in their development over the past two years. They realised how much money certain features could make, and ruined any possible theme the game may have once had. It has made its money however, and will continue to do so. I am merely curious to know whether the skins will be a part of that, or will prove detrimental overall.   Somehow, I doubt that.  Edit:  Lately it seems the company is making effort to improve the game in a surprising number of ways. It's a sign of effort at least, and far more than I anticipated from them. My original complaints have lost some traction in recent months with these changes, so I suppose I can change this to a hesitant yes for now, if they stay on this path.",

There is a high level of concern with the way starbreez are handling the situation after implementing what was stated that would not do: In game purchases.  I didn't like this idea for TF2, I certainly don't like it here. I might have been okay with it had Almir specifically said that they would not implement it. For that reason alone I cannot recommend giving your money to liars. It shows they do not respect the community and that means you. I was one of the ones who bought the completely overkill pack I was happy to support it. But when this happened I felt my trust was cheated for corporate greed.  My older review is below  Co-op is the main key to this one, if you don't have a good team you can be pretty much screwed. So have a mic at the ready or be ready to type real fast. Missions are nicely varied and the continual stream of new content is brill Overkill have put a lot of time and devotion into this game. I would also add that while other complain about DLC the only reason I can see it being a pain is that you have more deathwish levels to do to get that golden mask. The fact I can join a game in a level for a DLC I do not own is brill.  Grab your friends and lets rob the same bank again.... seriously they should be expecting us by now?",

In addition, the control of the game's updates are back in the hands of the players and Overkill. I will be changing my review from negative back to positive, and wish to congradulate Overkill on a job well done. Below are brief statements about the game I made awhile back about the whole micro-transaction fiasco, if you still care to read about it.      10/26/15 Overkill have addressed the issues stated below, but, in my opinion, gave lackluster answers to the community's questions. My review still stands as negative, and will stay so until they give us a long-term solution and/or compromise. I am overall disappointed with Overkill.  10/16/15 Below is my original review of Payday 2. Back then I loved it. I don't anymore. With the recent additions of MICROTRANSACTIONS, which were promised to never be present in the game, they have officially gone back on their word and deceived the community once again. I am unfortunately changing my review to a negative one, and it will stay like that until they have formally addressed the issues the community has with their actions.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Payday 2 is the definitive co-op shooter. The game relies heavily on cooperation which I like. You choose from multiple ways to attempt a heist. Go in guns blazing? Maybe try the backdoor? Kill the guards and disable the cameras? The option is yours, the player, to choose.   Payday 2 also has a unique weapon system. You can make any weapon you want, wether that be a long range sniping rifle, or a close quarters shotgun. There are hundreds of combination options to make your gun unique. In addition to weapon personalization, there is mask customization as well. You can't just feel and sound like the true heister. You have to look the part!  The game also features a skill tree. You can spend points under the Mastermind, Enforcer, Technician, and Ghost trees. If you have a team balanced in all four trees, you will be unstoppable. Each tree has specific skills that compliment the others well.  On top of all this, Overkill is supplying the players with a constant stream of content, both free and pay-for. They listen to the community well, and often deliver items and features the community desires.  Payday 2 has got to be my favorite shooter, by far. I reccomend this game to anyone new to the genre, AND to the veterans of the shooter. Please support this company and purchase this videogame. You won't regret it. See you on the streets of D.C.",

Despite only have two people on my friends list who enjoyed playing it as much as I did this game was still amazing and really fun.   Then Crimefest 2015 happened and a lot of promises were broken.  Microtransactions were placed in a game where they didn't belong.   Update 14/11/2015: I said I'd modify my review and here it is.  There has been no real changes made to the 'microtransaction' system implemented other than being able to obtain drill drops in-game to open the safes. I'm yet to recieve such a thing and from what I've seen the chances are stupidly low.  Another note, is that I purchased an item called 'The Completely Overkill Pack' a while ago which had 4 masks and a 'secret item' which was going to be 1 of 25 unique items revealled at a later date.  I have since opened the 'safe' that we recieved only to get a really bad looking shotgun weapon skin, and I got lucky. The special skins we got had various rarity and quality so anyone who spent $20/25 on this item might have been stuck with something worse than another person who paid the same amount of money.   It's a joke. I do not recommend this game because it's being developed by a company who consistantly breaks promises and then says they wish to be 'transparent' with its fans and 'listen to feedback' which I've yet to see any real indication of.   Go buy KF(2) or something else because this was the biggest dissapointment and waste of money for myself since pre-ordering Lost Planet 3.  Update 22/06/2016: So now the changes are happening. They have been slowly progressing over the past view months. Microtransactions aren't being removed but they are no longer being applied in future updates meaning all future safes can be opened for free. This is good, it would be nice to be able to open my old safes for free but I kinda get why they haven't changed that.  The game is still fun, but I only recommend getting this game if you can get it and all the DLC on sale. It's entirely possible for Overkill to screw up again and I don't think they'll revive from it unlike this occasion. Regarding the Completely Overkill Pack, they did make amends by releasing a lot of new 'Mega Masks' which for the most part do look cool. So that was nice to have. I mean, it's not giving us the highest type of weapon skin but I'll take it.  Over the past few months they have been fixing a lot of the mistakes they have made and now that they actually own Payday2 there's no excuse to ♥♥♥♥ up in the future.   So I recommend this game, because it's fun, because they've fixed their mistakes for the most part, but just be cautious with your money.",

Firstly I think it's important to say that yes I do recommend this game. PROS -The devs update the game very frequently even though this game came out already more than a year ago -The devs listen to their gaming community -A game where you can rob banks (isn't that what we've all dreamed of?) -Many many different guns to choose from: snipers, shotguns, machine guns, pistols etc... (Note many of these are DLC) -Many attachments for these weapons -Mask customization -A quite large amount of different heists to chose from -The game is active and still has many people on it to this day -You can shoot the Swat, normal peasanty policemen, big a-s-s heavy policemen... (Good plus for future terrorists) CONS -A few bugs which don't make the game unplayable, just annoying at some times -I don't know if this is just a coincidence but me and 4 of my IRL friends have the game and we ALL have mouse lag: to fix this you will have to manually fix the game with a mod or code the game file -LOADS OF DLC but then again, you don't have to buy them, they're mostly just for getting new weapons. -Once you get to a certain level, you'll know that farming the stealthy missions is the best way to level up and to get lots and lots of money -After more than 50 hours of game time, I found the game to be very repetitive and it doesn't give me any thrill anymore  There are probably more positive/negative things to note but these are what I think are the most important.

Go look it up on reddit, /r/paydaytheheist  17 days of grinding, heists on Death Wish (hardest level) being completed, people spending their offshore(spending cash is for weapons, items, etc, offshore is for hosting heists and other things) to earn loot drops.  All Culminated Into This.  Microtransactions. Randomly earn a safe (Crate) and buy a Drill(key) to unlock a random weapn skin. That has a slight, slight statistical buff. 5% to accuracy 1% to stability Etc. you get the idea.  I didn't care about the DLCs that were put out. But this. This is a big joke. OH, and the best part? Almir himself said they wouldn't do Microtransactions on Payday 2. At all.  Oh, one last thing- Weapon rebalance. Pistols are king. Heavy assault rifles and marksman type rifles are princes. SMGs are nobles. Shotguns and your general assault rifle are the stuff you scrape off your shoe when you walk into the house.  It's pretty bad right now. If something changes though, I'll change the review.  10/20/2016  Never seen devs turn around this fast on something. So far, difficulty rebalances, free guns and heists, and a new weapon pack coming out today that's going to be a favorite among all-UMP-45 is finally added, people love it.",

Alright, so now we have no more microtransactions, now we just have the pure, Payday 2 experience. Now that's great. But let's just think about the other half of the equation.  We are STILL having our accounts stung a fee every few weeks it seems, usually in exchange for more useless crap that we don't really care about. What I'd like to see, and what I'd be more than happy to pay for, is more maps. I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about this new heister, or that one, I just want to see more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps. Lots more.  I want to be able to look through the map catalogue, and be able to go hm, I haven't played these maps in a very long time, maybe I should try them out.  As it is, I can't ♥♥♥♥ing say that, can I? It's just, okay, what to play next, hm, farming map of the month, lets try that, or something like that. And oh my god why are there so many dupes? For ♥♥♥♥s sake, guys, at this point you've got like several different jobs tied to the same map. It's stupid.  I get building a heist takes time. I get that. But I'm sick of having 'guy-named-from-stereotypical-thing-related-to-voice-actor' come join our ranks. It's looking less and less like a group of thieves, and more like a private army.  inb4 8 man jobs  Anyway, whatever, I still recommend Payday 2, because it's still good, just I personally can't stand a game that, when it has a change that actually might bring me back to it, it's just a DLC that I need to pay for. I already own the game. I hate that. It's like 'hey guys this cool new thing just dropped' and then I'm like 'oh sweet can I play' and overkill is like 'gis $10 AUD first'  Living in Australia bumps up the price of every DLC by at least two dollars, and more sometimes.",

EDIT: So after a 8 month hitaus from the game, word came around that Overkill actually made the drills and safe dropable, making them free and not pay-2-win. Not only that, Payday doesn't seem to crash anymore on my laptop anymore and began to sell DLCs for a cheaper price now (Though the price-range wasn't really an issue, just that before the DLCs seemed half-♥♥♥♥♥, not as fun and breath-taking. Now they stepped up their game)... Althought this action shouldn't of happened in the first place, I forgive them. Everyone makes mistakes, and now I'm happy to say that I'm playing Payday now, and that I recommend this game to anyone now. Thank you Overkill for listening to us.",

I'd say the game is in an amazing state right now, and I could very easily recommend it to anybody who likes the premise or simply decent coop first person shooters.    OLD REVIEW: 6 Months ago, I would have recommended this game. 2 Months ago I probably would have recommended this game. But Overkill has really dug their own grave this time. Everyone else has said it better than I could, so I won't bother, other than to say that as it is I would never consider buying this game. Maybe, if overkill does a full 180 and fixes all of their screw ups, then maybe that would change. But at this point, myself and many others have reached the conclusion that it's too late. Considering what Overkill seems to have become, it's not likely they'll do, or that they would even want to do, what's necessary to save this game from drowing in the sea of their own mistakes.",

It's good to go loud and heist, good to sneak heist.  Somehow after like some hours stealth gaming with friends, I more and more reallize the very big issue of this game - the replication (data sync) mechanism of multiplayer gaming.  Payday 2 replicates attacking, player actions very good, it give you very good attack feedback when you are a client in a MP game.  But there is always a terrible delay of the player movement. I could see my friend run to me throwing me a bag from very far in my sight ,and the bag fell under my feet. This is because his position I see is actually the postion several seconds before. He's actually close to my postion right now. This is not a once or twice issue, this is a issue throughout the whole multiplayer gameplay, which means you have no idea where everyone is actually at. The player position you see are delay displayed.  In go louds, you have no idea where your teammates are going to do. Like in a escape. You see a guy in the back, you run back to him to help him. But he's actually catched up already, what you see is like 3 or 4 seconds ago. Then he see you in the back , he would go back to assit you. Then you both get killed. Or 3 people run to a drill postion, all start to drill because everyone see himself is the first one to get there.  Also, I think it might be a connected issue in multiplayer steath, client gamers are always so easy to be detected by guards. You think you already hide behind objects but the host doesn't know that, it still higher your detected level then you are busted. When I picked the stealth with my friend we didn't realize this ♥♥♥♥. We thought we were not skillful enough though before we switched turns to host and the other guy kept getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by unreasonable detections. If you are the host or in a offline single gamer mode, you can always sneak like a bird that's ♥♥♥♥ing easy. You can slip through the guards and camera nothing happens.  But if you are a CLIENT GAMER, THERE IS NO FXXKING WAY YOU CAN SNEAK SMOOTHLY. Me and my friend use the same ISP , and we tried in the same LAN. Same issues.  Later I googled it and found another video at youtube, showing him and his friend even had different alert reasons. I don't know if this happened to us but there were several times both of us saw the other one of us caused the alert and we strongly argued over these. Also in his video, the character movement delay is very obvious. There are a lot complaints for years about this but the developers never fix this issue.  I don't know why so many people even level up to 100 for so many times. I get fully mad before I get to the first 100. I probrably would play single player only.",

Infamy use to be something to strive for but some mask you unlock are not cool to get and to get to those masks you need to get unecessary exp boost infamy levels which are a waste of time to get. DLC are optional, as most heists you can get into as long as someone else has it, but weapons are pointless as the gimmiks they come with are either weaker than past DLC weapons or OP as hell compared to others. Im actually sad I actually believed these guys cared for the community that they would give free DLC over the 2 years of payday 2 they promised, but as it stands it seems that greed has gotten the best of another company that could have been great. I urge most people to watch videos or read into this game before buying it, if you feel that its something you'd enjoy buy it, but for me its too late.  Edit: This game is crap.

Now I am not sure but I am going off my understanding that when you buy skins or drills off the market 10% of the cash you pay goes to the developers I.E. OVERKILL TAKES 10% OF WHAT YOU PAY. My evidence to this understanding is that CS:GO and TF2 has transaction fees that do the samething, so I believe OK is doing the same thing. So this game is now complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in my eyes and and the developers DON'T care about the community they just want money.  2 Edit: The Developers don't care for the community. This game has become a joke. The developers gave us clues to what will be in the crimefest and all we were given was disappointment and masks. I now urge no one to buy this game unless your heart is dead set on buying and supporting a development team that was once so loved and respected to a hated team of developers who lie to the community they once equally respected. Almir if you some how come accross this review please just don't make a payday 3. Ive given up on the heist genre of games as this is nothing more than a cash grab from either overkill or starbreeze. You can't fix what is already completely broken.  3 Edit: Game is better now...  TL;DR: This game was once great and is now a disappointment and now is kinda great again. i am still very rollar coaster feel about the developers but they always bring good things then bad things but ♥♥♥♥ it. Some dlc is garbage while others are ♥♥♥♥ing jems and priced very well. I dont reccomend buying full price wait for them to do their 75% off deals they do every weekend and buy then.",

However, since Starbreeze reaquired the rights to the game and did away with what made everyone unhappy I decided to come back and give it a try. The game is pretty much as it has always been and given the frequent sales on the base game and its DLC, I'd say it's worth your money to purchase it if you haven't already. It has a good co-op experience and lots of replayability. I probably won't play it as much as I used to, but it will always be a game I can pick up and have fun with at anytime.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Really liked this game for the most part, but do not like or play P2W or Microtransactions. It would be one thing if this game always had Microtransactions. I would have just stayed away, but to add them in at this point feels like betrayal. There are other games to play and I'm moving on. Will never buy another Overkill game.",

The only complaint I would level, is that the DLC sometimes feels rather pricey for the content. The new Biker DLC is a pretty clear example of that. Splitting the content into two packs was a poor choice... And Almost nobody is running the Biker Heist because of it. Fix that, and you guys have done a real solid justice to your once loyal community.  Jump in, Masks on, Lets do this thing.",

I would recommend looking into mods as well. The modding community for this game is surprisingly good, and just having a few small tweaks to the game really helps.  Only issue is desynchronisation. This can be a real issue on stealth missions. This happened a couple times to me and resulted in our team losing the mission after I shot a guard that was in a completely different location on my teammate's monitor.

It's been a long time, and it feels like reconnecting with a lost friend.   Thank you, Starbreeze, and thank you, Overkill. I'm glad to have the game back.  As for 505, if any company reps read this...  You should'a better known better.     This game was cool, in 2013. It was okay in 2014. I convinced two of my friends to pick it up, after we got bored of pd the heist. Since we've been in 2015, though, it's seen a deluge of useless, padding DLC's. I stopped playing after the bbq update came out, and I haven't looked back once.   Now, I come to find out that Almir (and in my opinion, Overkill themselves by extension) have lied in the face of each and every one of their users. Now Almir won't even come out and explain himself to his community of dedicated heisters. Mods are treating alienated users with disrespect, unhesistant bans and cop-outs. I'll be attempting to get my money back, because this practice of adding in microtransactions, something that they promised people that were ON THE FENCE about buying the game, has been added. This destroys the credibility of ALL of the Overkill staff.   For shame, Almir. For shame, Simon.",

I purchased all of the DLC's and bought the completely overkill pack to support the developers and they have decided to reduce all accuracy and specs of the guns so the players will accumulate drop cards of safes which they can’t open unless they spend around $2.50 US for a drill!  Do not buy this game unless you want to keep on spending money to succeed.",

            "review_text": "EDIT 6/24/16: PAYDAY 2 has recently broken free of Starbreeze and have made great strides to return the game to a positive state, and in order to do this, on all future safes (crates), the opening cost will be nothing. You can open all future safes for free. This, in combination with the slew of free content they've added recently shows that they are trying to improve as a company and that they were possibly under pressure by Starbreeze to add microtransactions. Now that they're making an effort to improve, I'll happily change my review back to positive.  EDIT 10/15/15: This review was written a long, long, long time ago, and as of Crimefest 2015, Overkill has gone against their own word and begun to include microtransactions in a game where they promised there would be none. Until this is rectified, this review is negative, and I strongly urge you not to buy this game. I am sorry for those of you who missed out on all of the fun that was in the game prior to this update.   Payday 2 is the sequel to Payday: The Heist, which I admittedly do not own nor do I intend on owning it. I got this as a gift a while back and was kinda unsure about it. I didn't intend on buying this myself because it seemed relatively basic, but I was delighted to get in the game and find that I was wrong (in some aspects.) Payday 2 has it's ups and it's downs. We'll start on the upside first. On the ups, the game can keep itself fresh for a remarkable amount of time, even though there are only a small number of heists, the difficulty hikes are truly massive steps to take. Just making the step from Normal to Hard can be pretty tough, and don't even get me started on Very Hard. Just a little note. This game is EXTREMELY multiplayer oriented. If you try to solo it, it's incredibly difficult. Your only hope really is to turn on bots, of which you can only have 2 at a time, so it requires a buddy to join to make it a full crew. This is both good and bad for the game. For Multiplayer gamers, it adds a sense of necessity to cooperation, for single players, it just makes it feel kind of odd. At the end of every match, you have a chance of getting a mask customization item, gun mod, or a mask itself. I don't particularly like this system all that much. It may allow customization for your guns, but if there's a gun you want to be customizing to fit your build, but can't find any mods for it on the drops, looks like you're just stuck with a default gun until the x amount of time it takes to find a mod for it passes.  I'm really not all that sure of what keeps me interested in this game, it could be the definite role that each of your team members play, thanks to the game's flexible skill tree system (You could stack all on one tree or put a little into all of them,) the feeling of progress when you level up and look at how awesome your guy is now, or is it the fact that no matter how awesome your guy is, a Watchdogs heist on Very Hard is still going to wreck you.  I recommend this game, »ZCC« Zombie Chicken",

After +70 hours of gameplay, I find myself thirsting for more gameplay, heists, and battles. With dozens of heists and missions, each game seems fresh and new. On sale, this product is about $5. For a $5 game, it sure does pack a punch with an arsenal of weapons and content. Since this game is old, the developers periodically release dlc content for a reduced price. Payday 2 does a great job adding new weapons that add a new twist without making it pay to win. I could argue that this is my favorite game right now, but it is so different from other genres. This game is grandiose, including a variety of enemy types, weapons and gamemodes. If I could make one final verdict, I would state that this title is perfect, except its cheat detection. I frequently run into players spawning infinite money, weapons, and levels. This ruins the game, and I believe the developers should do a better job detecting it.   Final Verdict: 9/10",

The new CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands?   Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.  CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.  PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.  Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.  Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister.  More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations.  Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?  Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly.  New Game Content All the Time – More than 70 updates since release and still going strong with new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. Every month offers new free content and paid DLC as PAYDAY 2 continues to be developed by the OVERKILL crew until at least 2017.",

Payday 2 is a  Co-op  game, it revolves around teamwork and such, playing this game in solo is not recommended, as it may feel boring and tiresome after a few hours. Playing it with friends or pubs can be fun, even i still have fun with friends, messing around and throwing bags at each other and working together in the new difficulty, One Down.  You have skills, variety of weapons, melees, throwables, armors, deployables and perk deck, oh did i also mention, you can get a lot of masks and customize them to your fitting!  The game has a lot to offer to last around a few weeks of gameplay, quite a lot of heists and a lot of them are fun. It may get boring after some time but don't worry, either mess around, challenge yourself or play with friends to make it enjoyable again, or wait for the devs to update the game and add new heists.  Regarding the DLCs, there may be a lot but only quite a few are needed, or even yet none of them are needed at all. Its just there to add content.  And for the performance, i can't say its the best, but its not the worst either, some map lags, some doesn't. Can't be helped.  With that said, i think I'll give this game a 8/10, Oh did i also mention the OST? Now that's the best part about this game, the soundtracks, believe me you will love it. So whatcha waiting for?

More so now than ever due to pugs who can't win at One Down so they cheat. tsk tsk. - A lot of old 'obsolete' dlcs that can't really hang with the One Down difficulty, due to low weapon damage, and overall not amazing content wise. But this is slowly getting better.   But don't get me wrong this game is great.

I purchased many DLC packs and bundles as well as The Completely Overkill DLC, my support was real but the DLC kept coming and the quality kept dropping and they kept adding one trash character after another. I looked the other way when the 'BIG ANNOUNCEMENT' was an indorsed absolutely horrible Keanu Reeves/John Wick character that they couldn't even afford to get Keanu to play.  The introduction of 'Safes' and the nerfs that followed which required you to pay REAL MONEY (Microtransactions) to open safes and give you a random chance to get the skins and stuff to return nerfed weapons back to their former glory (Original stats pre-nerf) was really the final nail in the coffin for me.

The live action stories that go along with the game aren’t half bad and gives you an inside look on how the characters act and some back ground on them. Also with mission briefings you get some insights on how the crew interacts with the people who hire you and their roles on crime net and in the payday universe. This game is not the most story driven game but dose add a nice touch to the games lore if you are looking to learn more about this world and characters in it.  Gameplay The game play has changed much over the years from skills, levels, characters additions, perk decks, micro transactions added then removed but the core game is still there. This game is a great coop fps-skill leveling projection system this adds a lot of replay if being max level is your thing. The heist some are fantastic others are a little underwhelming but over all very satisfying when you complete a heist on higher difficulties. I do recommending playing with others online rather than solo your ai team just shoot enemies and will not help with objectives (think L4D). But overall the controls are good and feels like most other games of this type (killing Floor,L4D) sometimes hit boxes feel off but once you get use to them they are horrible. The skill system and perk decks are great to make any build for anyone’s play style and really make it so your character feels like your own. I do feel some skills need nerfs and buffs some are op in dw and others are under whelming and rarely get used any more.   Visuals and Sound The visuals are good but sometimes the optimization is horrible connections lost in the mid of the heists. Random lag spikes for no reasons and random game freezes this issues use to be a lot worse but have gotten better over the while. The soundtrack is great some of the music is some the best I have heard in a game for years but others are fall short. Most of the voice actors that did characters really put in time and effort to make the part there own there are a few that are generic and feels like they put very little in the part.   The Good -Solid Fps Heist game -Huge selection of maps -Very intense moments -Great Sound Track -Unique Skill/Perk system - Good Visuals  -Great leveling system -No buying drills safes for safes in game now   The Bad -Gets Old if no new heists get released over time  -Bugs and Some Crashes -Adding micro transactions -Overpriced DLC at times -Price for game needs to drop 14.99    Conclusion STORY 8/10 GAMEPLAY 9/10 CONCEPT 9/10 GRAPHICS 8/10 AUDIO 9/10 MULTIPLAYER 10/10 FINAL RATING 9/10  Other Games like this: Left 4 Dead 1-2, Killing Floor 1-2, borderlands1-2, Hotline Miami.",

So much so that my g/f and I own all of the DLC between us, and even donated an extra $19.99 each with the 'Completely Overkill' pack because we wanted to support the team that was so good to us as a community. We also bought the regualar 'Overkill Pack' for the goodies. We have each spent $100.00+ dollars to contribute and support further development of the game we loved. Gaming since a child, and now 33 years old, this is the most expensive game I have ever owned.   Now they nerfed all my ♥♥♥♥ that I've been using for two years and want me to buy weapon enhancements to get my crew to be effective again. Rebuild weapons with ♥♥♥♥ I have to buy for weapons I've been using over 400 hours. No thanks. That's not acceptable. I did my part and now it's time to move on.

Good : 👍 Great, fast-paced and fun gameplay  👍 Replayability: There are a lot of missions and multiple difficulties to choose from, some are stealth-able and others are straight up loud. 👍 Variety of characters: As of now, there are sixteen characters to choose from and most of them are pretty unique and have amusing voicelines like Jiro, Jacket, Jimmy. 👍 Various playstyles: There are a lot of skills to choose from, depending on your preferred playstyle. From being a dodgy character who relies on luck and uses dual-wielding pistols to a tanky character with heavy armour, slow movement speed and hard-hitting with a shotgun. There are also missions for people who prefer going loud and also those who prefer playing stealth. 👍 Modding capabilities: The modding community is pretty active and there are a lot of mods that change the game in their own way, whether purely looks or cosmetics like masks, sounds, weapon skins, HUD, or custom maps or mods that can change the entire gameplay like that one stealth mod.   Bad : 👎 Huge update sizes: Payday 2's updates can be huge even for small changes or additions to the game, this can be an issue for people with slow Internet or people on a data cap. 👎 Desync issues: At times there would be desyncronisation occuring, this is very noticable when you see a teammate's animations moving really fast. 👎 Amount of DLCs: The amount of DLCs the game has can be quite overbearing to most, especially new players. Though for players who have put in a lot of hours into the game and enjoy it often don't mind paying for the DLCs, I'm guilty of this.. sometimes. 👎 The drill: After spending a lot of time earning cash, continental coins, safehouse upgrades, weapons, loot, you still can't purchase a drill that doesn't break itself multiple times. Thanks Bain. 👎 Bullet sponginess: As of Hoxton's Housewarming Party, difficulty levels now change the HP multipliers of the cops, the higher the difficulty, the more HP a unit would have. This makes a lot of weapons useless, it could take up a lot of ammo to kill a normal unit.  Also, how does a bow do more damage than a .50 cal sniper rifle?  They have somewhat addressed Mayhem by giving the enemy units' Overkill HP and Death Wish damage and tweaking a bit of the numbers (?).   Notes : 👌 Achievements: There are a lot of achievements for the game, if one is an achievement hunter then they might see this as a good thing, for others, perhaps not. Some achievements also unlock in-game items such as masks, weapons or weapon mods. Achievements are being added as more content is being put into the game.   Suggestions : 💡 Better difficulties: Rather than introducing HP multipliers for the cops, I'd rather they kept it the way it was before but make the cops on higher difficulties deal more damage and introduce more difficulty-unique units.  I try to edit my review as I play the game more and as the game gets more updates.  EDIT 1:  So this is how it feels to be on the receiving end of a robbery. Just as I was about to get back into PAYDAY 2 because of friends and Crimefest, we get transactions and  rebalanced  weapons. Great. Just great.   EDIT 2: Game is less pay-to-win now, thanks update 100.",

Then came the safe updates....and I stepped away, because I, like most, didn't agree with the idea of getting cosmetic/power based skins for weapons in a game that had no PVP in it, found it completely unnecessary.  Came back after the update in which safe drops at that point would be free and have had a blast yet again with the safehouse update and much more. Thanks Overkill.

The good: This game indeed can offer many hours of fun either customized or for their difficulties also possesses a wide repertoire of dlc that instead of limiting the game as some dlc makes it much bigger, the miss this game has both dlc does not make a pay to win as it can get perfectly infamy level xxv 100 without any dlc weapons as the only dlc that came to be very op was the chivalry cage pack who brought the crossbow kills dozers in one down but was nerf as deserved (which happens to you overkill, as a crossbow arrow ♥♥♥♥ can do 4000 dmg does not make sense) and also the game makes you working on anything team that many games can not do coff coff call of coff coff.  The bad: its optimization sad optimization many will say not this game it's going very well blah blah blah but I miss this game to run worse in low graphics that current games like evolve with completely different graphics is painful and the safehouse as hate safe house is my favorite place to play at 20 fps also and seen that many people complain that this game is very heavy in terms of virtual weight since half of the weight of the files was dlc but in my opinion I do not complain this since my pc can perfectly keep this amount of files also I enjoy this content because I have dlc.  Conclusion: Is the game worth 10 dollar? if this game perfectly can give you 100 to 400 or 500 hours of play according to the free time you have and unsociable you are also the dlc greatly extend the game and the only thing bad about it is the optimization and weight but aside that the game is now on value discount for hours can give totally worth it",

I personally have never stopped playing this game because it's always been fun for me. I personally like seeing all the new updates and DLC that come out for it. One thing people complain a lot about is the sheer amount of DLC that gets released; however, the game does get some good free updates along with the paid ones. One thing I tend to do is to wait until a lot of it goes on sale (which it does frequently) and snag it up then. Being on a budget, this is the best way to enjoy all the different content released. It also adds more fun to the game and new things to try out (new heists, heisters, guns, builds, etc).  Overall, I have no real compaints about this game. I feel I've gotten my money's worth and have never had any issues with online play, but I must say it's best played with friends and people you know.

These packs are what draws a lot of negative criticism for the game and I completly understand it, as much as I understand that I don't have to necessarily buy them to enjoy them game; I choose to buy the DLC packs because I want to show support to the studio.  But seriously, there's a lot of content here: with over 150 guns to use, over 1000 levels to gain, 545 achievments, cosmetic gun skins available through CS:GO style roulettesdozens of heists to try on six different difficulties, and multiple specializations and skill trees to boost your talents you could be playing this game for a very long time and gaining absurd amounts of money while doing so.

You run around as a professional criminal, committing crimes, fighting security guards and the police, and trying to get away with your nefarious endeavours.  The game is quite good. Team up with three friends and you can have some enjoyable gameplay.  However, people need to be aware that PayDay 2 is often updated with updates of several gigabytes - if you have a slow connection or a download limit, then that could be a real pain.  On a related note, the developers have gone in for downloadable content in a big way. The overwhelming majority of the DLCs have to be bought. To give you an idea of the state of things: At present (16 Dec. 2016) the game costs $19.99, whilst the DLCs cost $158.65 (the Steam store page lists 46 DLCs, nine of which are free).  It's still a good game, but the developers are trying really hard to make players pay over and over again by farming DLCs, which is not an impressive modus operandi. DLC farming is probably good for the developers as a commercial tactic, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. If they keep doing things like that, they could really cheese off people in the gaming community - just as the money-grabbing techniques employed by the marketers of the Battlefield series meant that I stopped buying them from Origin (they were good games, but paying for commercial rip-offs leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and I stopped giving them my money).",

Geometry, visual effects and textures are poor. the optimization is bad. AI behavior is depending on the hosts CPU speed. Bugs regularly get fixed and replaced with different ones. Difficulty scale has big gaps. From an aesthetic standpoint the animations are poor. physics feel like from the last century and through added DLCs an updates, the game has gradually shifted towards a different target audience. from a 90'es signature styled heist game based in Washington DC, PD2 turned more and more into an arbitrary CS:GO-pink M4 Carbine-something-with-goats for the lulz. Yes, I am still laughing. not.  Why do I still recommend Payday 2? Its a great shooter which rewards you for paying attention to your team members. The higher the difficulty, the more the game will weld you and your 3 friends together into a perfect clockwork. Hero/Macho/Chicken players get penalized for ignoring the needs of the team and the objectives. As I have gained more experience in the game, it felt very rewarding to beat a heist on a high difficulty level - especially in stealth.  The game soundtrack supports those adrenaline pushes, but it becomes annoying over time.",

If the devs dont implement a trading system then make weapons and attachments unlocks. What makes this worse is that it costs money to attach weapn mods and quite a bit sometime with no way of testing an attachment to see if thats the one that you want  2. The grind is ridiculous, not only will you need a exhorbitant amount of money for practically everything but above level 60 leveling up takes forever. Did i meantion that perks cost money and skill ponts and cost an insane amount?  3. networking issues are inconsistent. I only successfully joined a third of the games i wanted with some people saying everything went always right.  4. The base game's weapon arsenal is underwhelming at best. The number of weapons isnt the problem though' it's that the base game lacks grenades, lmgs, snipers and shotguns while having way too many assault rifles and smgs.   5. in tandem with point 4, the game has turned into a platform to sell dlc. Not only is overkill shoving a load of on dlc on the players its getting more and ridiculous and plain outright stupid.",

With that said, whenever the game goes on sale all the dlc does to and its usually only 1.50 or so for almost any of the dlc.  If you liked the first game, have people to play with, and are an achievement hunter, by all means buy this. You get a (dlc) bow that can one shot all enemies outside of a buldozer.

Graphics are very good, dialogue is funny and witty, and it's a challenge to play right. So there was quite a controversy over the past year however in this game because of Overkill's 'Crimefest Day One' update. The developers of this game had nerfed every weapon and introduced cosmetic skins, a la CSGO, but some weapon skins also had their own stat buffs, essentially including P2W microtransactions. The only way to really augment your build to the best it could be was to buy a drill to unlock a safe, which would drop a skin of a random quality, which works the exact same was as the aforementioned CSGO's skin crates work. For a time this made me put the game down as I was quite frustrated with the way the devs done things.  Thankfully, after the outcry of many players, the developers listened to the community and removed the microtransactions. Now all the skins can be unlocked for free and the safes and drills can both drop ingame at the end of a heist, where you choose one of three random rewards.   But the game is still great and has a lot of content, yes, but there is a LOT of DLC which is annoying. You don't really need any of it but it will lock you out quite a bit of the game. And the DLC is pretty frequent too. I would recommend the game but the sales are your best bet if you wish to get it and the DLC as it costs far too much for everything otherwise.",

Alright... still, I'd stay away until Overkill actually can confront the community and flat out tell us whether they still want us here or to ♥♥♥♥ off.

This could have been prevented had I been the host, yes, but this will not stop the people going around being ♥♥♥♥♥ to the community, those that have their comments disabled on their profile is frustrating also, as there is no way to warn the people in their next lobby.  2: The DLC for a couple attachments and weapons are overpriced, I'd only reccomend picking DLC up on sale or via a third party site.  For that price I could have bought several other AAA games with all of their DLC.  On top of that the forum moderators were absolutely no help at all, the community is just plain toxic annd I would not reccomend even touching this game with a ten foot pole.",
