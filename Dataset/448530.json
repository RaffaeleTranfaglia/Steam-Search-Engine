Love the look and feel of the game, reminds me of some classic nintendo games, of old. Simply hooked on the simple mechanics, trying to get prefect on some of the later levels is keeping me in the game. Squash those evil plants!",

            "review_text": "This game really should've been either a mobile game or a flash online game. It feels very out of place in the steam store. It has some bugs and the puzzles honestly aren't that engaging. It doesn't really suck me in. I don't know that I'd even think it was worth it on sale, it's really difficult for me to come back to the game and want to play it again.  It almost feels like there are TOO MANY levels. The progression is so slow without any new features being introduced, it gets really dull.  Pros: -It's not horrible to look at -It'd make a great flash game -It's cheap  Cons: -It's not great to look at -Puzzles are tedious -Does not add new features for long lengths -Feels more frustrating than challenging -Music is repetitive -Sideways controls not intuitive -No achievements -Long levels that require multiple playthroughs  I can't really recommend.",
