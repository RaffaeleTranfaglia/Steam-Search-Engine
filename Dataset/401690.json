But it would be nice to have a way to keep tab on the embryo gnerator how many kids you need to crack out to keep the population stable first bunker death by old age. Live and learn Also I have 2 GPUs and sometimes it locks up just for like 3 seconds but no crashes yet.",

I don't understand all the negative reviews. For 15.99 I would say this game is a fun bargain. If I get 15 hours of enjoyment out of this game it is definately worth it. I have noticed the communication with the devs is pretty good and responsive so I expect lots of updates and improvements.",

Unfortunately there was not as much love put into this one I am afraid.   After about 4 hours I discovered everything. So far I don't see a reason to play it again. At first Life In Bunker is quite tough but it gets easy incredibly fast. There should be at least kind of a campaign. But right now the only play mode is not really offering a lot.  I am really not particular on spending money for games, but this one is not yet worth the price tag. I hope there will be features added or there will be mods.",

I did not see the people using beds and eating at the table. I could never get the cook to cook. I don't know if those things are even required, due to that. The game is slow moving and I did not realize how unenjoyable it was until it was too late to request a refund.",
