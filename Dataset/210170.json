            "review_text": "Spirits is a short name for little ghosts that pollinate plants in a magic forest. This amazing puzzle game is in lower levels very easy to play and turned out in the last levels as quite challenging. It reminds me mostly of Lemmings. You have either these special abilities like digging through walls (bashing), blowing other spirits over gaps or blocking wind streams as a bloated spirit which you can assign to each of them. Of course then its life is lost. The aim is to bring as much as possible of them to the great magic swirl. Additional the spirits are reacting on windstreams but mostly they must be bewared of walking or floating into dangerous spikes everwhere. Dumb as lemmings ... In a level each plant must be pollinated and a certain number of spirits must survive to solve the map perfectly. Your world rank is even breakdown to each level and will be permanently updated after playing. Not many people have seen the last levels it seems. And also the least achievements to make the last levels all perfect are quite rare. But lots of fun to do them.",

Each spirit can be sacrificed to perform a specific task such as blowing in a particular direction to assist the remaining (providing you strategically positioned it right). It’s a strategy game with a balanced flow of progressive difficulty and replaying levels gives the encouraging feeling of “I know I could do better.”  The hand-drawn art is simply gorgeous and the soundtrack delightful.

It offers little to no story, background music is too repetative and becomes annoying really quickly and the controls, whilst being very simple are flawed. You can never predict where will the guy actually go other than setting its general direction which presents a big problem on the more advanced levels I presume.  I haven't played the game for a lot but every minute I did was somewhat painful and I only lasted that long because I wanted to give a better and more detailed review.",
