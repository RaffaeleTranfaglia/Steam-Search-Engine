            "review_text": "This game was quite disappointing. Despite being a detective game, there is very little actual investigations - the game turns into a simple point and click adventure game pretty quickly. While that is done quite well, and the puzzles themselves are quite good, albeit quite standard for the most part, the narrative structure of a Sherlock Holmes novel just fits terribly. As a game, you expect to be able to influence events as you come across them, not have Sherlock Holmes solve them behind the scenes and present the results afterwards - when you PLAY as him. As a player, I would have liked to be the one to logically think up the clever plots and put them in motion, not switch to Watson and be forced to ignore evidence available to let the plot move along. As a mystery game, this fails spectacularly... which is surprising considering that this game is quite well made - with the exception of some of the worst animations I've seen in a long time.",

            "review_text": "TL:DR A point and click crime game that I found surprisingly enjoyable even if its a bit rough around the edges  Full Version: The Testament of Sherock Holmes is a point and click crime adventure. The story begins with Holmes and his sidekick Dr.Watson investigating a murder which soon turns out to be part of a wider plot. I went into this game not really knowing what to expect and ended up pleasantly surprised. Its a pretty good game even though it lacks a bit of polish. The story is pretty good, Sherlock Holmes and Watson are both likeable and the game has pretty good puzzles and investigation.   Theres a lot of 'use this item with this thing' but rather than having ridiculous item combinations , like a lot of other point and click games, this one is quite good for having logical solutions. Even when I picked up an item and first thought 'what the hell will I do with this?', with more investigation the solution nearly always became clear with a bit of logical thought. It keeps the game flowing nicely without any frustrating sections.  There are minor problems like an annoying camera, occasional difficulty moving Holmes around and for some reason interacting with an object would sometimes cause Holmes to walk a few metres away before reacting. Luckily theres no issue bad enough to ruin the game.  Good points: - The game has a great story and it kept me involved enough to want to find out what happens next - Good puzzles and solutions that rarely are frustrating or ridiculous  Bad points: - The game has a few minor bugs and glitches like annoying camera angles and the occasional glitch when interacting with something but nothing major -Some of the voice acting for the minor characters is terrible",

It's always hard to find a good 'mystery' game that isn't just a seek-and-find snoozefest, and I enjoyed this game immensely! Controls can be a little frustrating sometimes, but the game is really more about the plot and the investigation than anything else, so it wasn't a huge issue by any means.  Get it on sale, because as fun as it is, it just isn't worth $20 - it didn't last very long and there isn't a lot of replay value. Don't let the '~20 hrs on record' fool you - most of that is from when I accidently left the game running overnight. You're looking at around 10-13 hours of gameplay, depending on how thorough you are in each map.",

I had my doubts before I bought it, because I was afraid that it wouldn't be so good or mentaly challenging enough, but I was proven wrong. You constantly have to use your mind to solve puzzles with logic and deduction. I also love the fact that you can easily change perspective from first person to third person depending on what's most suitable at the moment. If you aren't so good at first person shooter-games and want to use your logic and deduction skills then this will probably suit you perfectly, but I think pretty much anyone who enjoys puzzlegames will find this entertaining.  PROS - Challenging riddles and puzzles - Beautiful and detailed setting - Ability to change perspectives - Good Sherlock Holmes-feeling - AMAZING twists, especially at the end  CONS - Slightly repetitious from time to time - Many details to remember, sometimes a bit too much",

            "review_text": "Conveys the Sherlock Holmes I know and love from the books and short stories, in a way most other visual media won't do. The puzzles are brilliant. Very difficult to guess correctly; you certainly have to think about it. Watson is funny but very like the Watson I'm familiar with from the books. He's slightly slower to cop on here but that's fine.  The game design is nearly flawless. Just a couple of glaring UV seams not worth mentioning (would you look at that, I've mentioned them) but no-thing else to complain about there. Some slightly overused NPC models but it's an indie game so you expect that sort of thing. Really good attention paid to Victorian English culture, accents, clothing, architecture, &amp;c. Though a couple of articles of clothing, if I'm to be overly fastidious, are American and not British. You won't notice. Only me.  The story is perfect. The acting is mostly perfect. A couple of less believable actors but most of it's great.  I will complain about the controls. It doesn't matter much because you don't really need fast response time in this game, but in third person some stuff is annoying because it takes far longer than you'd expect, and this is fixed by going into first person view.  Overall, great game, great story, great puzzles, great Holmes, great Victorian London. Very impressed by the puzzles.",

            "review_text": "To be frank, one of the best games I've played in a long while. This may be due to my growing fascination with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's masterpiece of Sherlock Holmes, but I found this game to be riveting until the very end. It's not often that I find something that I am actually saddened by its ending. The story was magnificent, and the gameplay was not bad either.  As a game this is a point and click adventure that you can also play in first person (as the third person option I found to be frankly useless). It's a damn good one at that. This contains some of the more frustrating puzzles I've seen in a game, yet it managed to actually keep me engaged in figuring them out instead of just angering me until I quit. I admit that I have not beaten this without a walkthrough, although I felt bad for using it when I needed it. This game makes you use your brain.  The game itself was also made quite nicely, the animation not perfect, but voice acting and immersion were fairly great, at least to me. In short, magnificent puzzle game with wonderful story, Sherlock being one of my favorites.  I simply cannot wait for Sherlock Holmes: Crime and Punishments to be released.",

            "review_text": "Frogwares has been doing Sherlock Holmes games for more than ten years. You'd think they'd gotten pretty good at it, but judging by The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, they've just gotten sloppy. The engine is getting visibly long in the tooth, and the mystery you're solving this time does some very un-Holmesian leaps of logic and plausibilty towards the end.  The production values are just plain mediocre all around. While some of the puzzles are fun, there is an alaming number of inventory puzzles requiring you to combine various ropes and ladders into longer ropes and ladders. At its worst, the gameplay just devolves into a hotspot hunt, a variation of the dreaded pixel hunt. Not recommended unless you're either a hardcore Holmes fan, or a hardcore adventure game fan.",

I just love investigation games where you have to find clues and then deduce to figure out what really happened, and you definitely expect that from a Sherlock Holmes game. In that department it doesn't fail to deliver, except that I wish there was more of it. The story of the game is fairly interesting too, quite dark and a bit out there. Actually I feel it is a bit too far out there at times.  You can choose to play from a 3rd person perspective or 1st person. Because of the somewhat clunky controls and movement I ended up playing it in 1st person to not become too frustrated. You alternate between controlling Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson through the story and even Toby the dog. Especially Toby here felt out of place and especially clunky and odd. Not only did that part feel unrealistic to the point of ridiculousness, but for he most part it did not even make any sense. I do not want to spoil too many details, but let's just say don't get caught up in where the tracks lead you. Half the time they didn't even show up. At least not until you'd been going back and forth several times. It is good to see that a developer is trying something new and original, but this was not a success in my eyes.  What really stands out in this game, in my opinion, is the voice acting. They were just really really good. I don't know if it is because the British language just seems more dramatic and sincere or what it is, but everyone felt very believable.  There's a good mix of search and find, puzzles, mini-games and exploration. I found the deduction boards to be creative and fun and the puzzle boxes to be less so. Either way I enjoyed the game as a whole and would easily recommend it to anyone enjoying these types of games.  I rate the game 7/10  Happy Gaming!",

            "review_text": "I should start saying that this one belongs to the adventure category, and it's of the same spirit as the old-school, 2D poin-n-click games. It seems necessary to point that out, because, apparently, some reviewers let the 3D graphics fool them, and forgot about this fact. As a matter of fact, no other adventure could really beat this one in graphics or atmosphere, but it's still an adventure game; not an action game, not a RPG. And it's great at that. Anyone who feels the need of a change in pace, and want to slow down a little bit, and imerse themselves in a fantastic world of decadence, misteries and violent, apparently unsolvable crimes, can always count with the cold-blooded, logically-minded Mr. Holmes, and the loyal and righteous Dr. Watson as their guides. The characters are inarguably great on this one. Sherlock Holmes is clearly at his best, but Dr. Watson really awes the player for his distinction: a completely independent and complex character on his own. Their voices match perfectly and are totally convincing. Actually, the whole soundtrack is perfectly adequate to the game as a whole. Really good adventure, indeed. But, to be honest, there are some drawbacks also. The player will be every now and then distracted by the likes of bad lip sincronization, the somewhat awkward character movimentation, clunky gameplay, lots of invisible walls, and lack of animations when using objects. Also, the puzzles are not too much of a challenge for experienced puzzle solvers, no more than two or three of them would hold an adept back for more then ten minutes. On the other hand, they are so well crafted and fun to solve, that one can not help but feel well rewarded when the problem is solved. Anyway, if there are drawbacks, none of them could prevent the player from getting addicted to the appealing atmosphere and charming characters. 'It's simplicity itself': just get it right now.",

I like that that it isn't another shooter. It isn't open world, but I kinda like that it isn't it works for this title, and keeps you focused and on path. Worth gettting on sale very entertaining get it.",

The puzzles were barely rebranded versions of a dozen other puzzle games and there was little, other than the fact I'd bought it already, to keep me interested in playing.  The 'hint system' is awkward and in most cases useless, there's a lot of going round in circles as you have to inspect the same item more than once with little more than a word to direct you to it. Being that the game lacks a progress tracker, or 'quest log' it's very easy to lose track of where you're supposed to go, doubly so if you get bored of the overly dramatic dialog and skip it.  I took the time to finish this game and it frustrated me in all the wrong ways. I definitely wouldn't replay this (although I did miss out on a couple of achievements...) and probably won't play any prequals or sequals.",

I happened to get this on sale and can't believe the bargain in entertainment I received, but would still highly recommend it at full price.

Now that I've gotten that back, let me tell you what I think of the Testement of Sherlock Holmes.  First, the good things. 1. As usual, the atmosphere is spot on. And I could swear that the dialogue is written by Conan Doyle himself. It genuinely feels like a Sherlock Holmes adventure. 2. The investigation is really well done. Whenever you need to search a body for marks or a room for clues, it feels like L. A. Noire. 3. The tension in the first half of the game is really thrilling. The sense that Sherlock Holmes may be insane, or not who he says he is is gripping and kept me playing to try and decipher why exactly Sherlock Holmes was being so edgy and confrontation. There is no greater conflict in a Sherlock Holmes adventure than questioning the legitimacy of your hero.  Now, let's talk about what' bad. 1. Puzzles. Puzzles, Puzzles, Puzzles, Puzzles, Puzzles! Way too many puzzles, and most of them are stupid, complicated, and have no explanation of mechanics, objective, or context. I am grateful that the game includes a 'skip puzzle' button, but it's a bad sign when it needs to be included. 2. Adventure-game inventory management. In the early game, the investigation of murders was so strong in gameplay, that it was a shock when I started to have to search for random objects with no idea why I needed them or how they were supposed to be used. Most of the rest of the game is classic combine this with that and use it on that. This wouldn't be a problem, if it was simply transitions between one mystery to another. But instead it makes up the majority of gameplay, and doesn't do it particularly well. 3. The ending is completely non-sequitor and the prologue with awkwardly animated and voice-acted children is really poorly handled, it almost felt like a completely different story spliced into one about Sherlock Holmes struggling with an insidious threat to his integrity. 4. I hesitate to mention this, because I am a strong believer that poor graphics, animation, voice acting, etc. can be compensated for by compelling gamplay. And Bullfrog has come a long way since Sherlock Holmes: the Awakened in terms of animation and cinematics, but it still looks pretty amateur, and it would go a long way for their franchise if they worked on animation and cinematic timing.  So ultimately, I recommend this game for its strong beginning and great tension. But regret that it missed its mark in a lot of technical respects.",

The way Sherlock portrayed on fidelity, and it fits well in this context. He is the type who does not care about what others think, because he knows he is always right. His counterpart , Dr. Watson, is also well poytrayted, and the dialogue between them entertains.  To resolve matters using 'Deduction board' I thought that was an interesting way to do it. Here I got really used the brain, and it gave a great sense of achievement when I understood the context. Unfortunately there were not enough of these, in my opinion. I would like to see that they made a few more varieties of these, and fewer of mini games that were too difficult gradually.

There are many moments, particularly in the first 2 acts of the game, where the opportunities to explore a (for a 2012 Indie title) incredibly beautifully-rendered Victorian London are a real treat. And trapsing around 221B Baker Street and looking at all the fun nods to the original stories is a pleasure... for a few minutes. Then the clunky mechanics and occasionally asenine puzzle-solving makes it feel less like a game about Sherlock Holmes, and more like having Sherlock Holmes' name slapped onto a rather dull point-and-click adventure. The voice acting is pretty good, though Watson (whom you hear more of in this game than anyone) was a bit too whiny and nasaly to want to listen to for 10 hours.  In all, if you're a big Sherlock Holmes fan like myself, it's definitely worth buying when it goes on sale. The game is wonderful when it pays homage to the original stories and keeps to the established canon. But when things start going off the rails story-wise toward the end, or when the puzzles start just being puzzles for puzzles' sake rather than real mysteries to be solved, it becomes a bit of a chore to muscle through.  TL;DR? 6.5/10, Good graphics, decent voices, good fanservice, but clunky and story gets dumb at the end.",
