            "review_text": "I was so excited to hear this game was coming out. It reminded me of my all time favorite game, Ultimate Soccer Manager. That came out back in the 90's. I'm sadden to say, this is a washed up version of it. Yes, it does have the potential to be a good, if not great game! However, I think they should go back to the drawing board and work on it a little more.   It does remind me of Ultimate Soccer Manager, but there need to be more clubs and leagues associated with it. I'm hoping the game will get better as time goes on. I'm disappointed with some of the simple spelling errors you notice in the game, however it does keep you entertained for a few hours at least. After that, you loose interest.   I would give this game a 2.5 out of 5 stars. It's on the right track, but just misses the finish line.",
