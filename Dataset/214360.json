Tower Wars doesn’t know me. Tower Wars doesn't understand that I have to make a solid effort to remember the garlic bread I put in the oven whilst cooking a bolognese. Tower Wars also doesn't realise I often forget to buy spaghetti. Tower Wars, dinner is cancelled. Tower Wars, I can hardly manage tower defence or tower attack on their own, let alone both. Tower Wars, stop mocking my ability to multitask please. D:  Tower Wars can be played online, though an interesting concept for a tower defence game, I dared not try it. I lost to the base level AI, that was humiliating enough. I didn't feel like demonstrating how many ♥♥♥♥♥ I can suck at this game to online players. :C  Great game for it's price, but it's not for me!",

If you're too good at the rest, come play with the best. A super-helpful and friendly community, addicting gameplay, ranked seasons where players who truly put in the effort can win fame and prizes and a delightfully whimsical Steampunk art style. The learning curve is high, but those who perservere and learn the ropes march towards glory. Be warned: You WILL get your backsides handed to you your first few rounds in multiplayer, but not to fret. The community has done a great job of creating guides and videos that are easily available to get new players up to speed, and the guy who just slaughtered you in six rounds will also more than likely be totally willing to give you a practice round or two to show you how things work. All that said, my favorite part of this game is actually the audio and voice acting. Skillfully put together, it matches the art in theme and energy, and the voices of both the King and the troops are amusing even when you're on a losing streak.",

Because your enemy is not a set of 20 pre-made waves. It is a Human.  Yes, Tower Wars, as Avertised is a PvP tower Defense Game. And while it follows the 'Mazing' style of TDs (you have no predetermined path enemies take. you have a patch of land and the enemies will take the shortest route towards your Fortress) it also forces you to focus on how you will attack.  You gain resources by killing enemies and having your people waddle as far as they can.  Now the Towers and Enemies are where the fun starts. You are not presented with the standart 'Normal tower/ Faster but weaker tower/Splash Tower/Slow Tower' variety, but rather towers that focus on different kinds of Health as well as some supporting towers, like a wind turbine that slows enemies in its path or a huge pot that throws boiling oil to all its sides. As far as the offensive units go, you go from the why do I worry-kind of standart waddler, faster waddlers, healing waddlers, shielding waddlers, carrying waddlers, as well as Upgrades for them. in the end I believe you stand with as many supporting units as you have actual damaging units.  Rounds may be short (if any of the players really messes up his BO) or can draw out to a 2 hour 'We all send a full wave of our biggest units, all fully upgraded through each others maze and look what happens'-Stalemate. but even those are fun, because its like a snail race. In the end you only win or lose by a hairs width.  Also, Bots in 10 difficulty flavors have been implemented. So if you cant find a match (or just wanna get back in form) you can always challenge one of those to get your TD Madness on",

The mods were so much fun, so it's awesome that SuperVillain made an actual game to pretty much officially kick off the genre (I think?)! Basically, not only do you set up your towers and maze to defend, but you send out your own armies to attack the other castle! Lots of units to unlock and upgrade by using an RTS system (tech tree). And the humor is a nice touch too. Who doesn't love a robot named Stanley Clunkerbottom? The meat of the experience is the multi-player for sure! It supports local hosted and ranked matches, so you can play with friends until you're ready to head out into a ranked match. 2v2 is probably my favorite, and the game goes all the way up to 3v3 (and 1v1 of course). And there IS a single player 'Classic' mode, which is like other normal Tower Defense games where you just defend as long as you can. But this thing REALLY shines in multi-player modes that it's built for!  And, for what it's worth, the game is gorgeous if you have a gaming PC with some muscle. But it also lets you customize all settings for weaker machines too, and even looks pretty good at lower settings. Looks like a miniatures set up! I want to play this in real life!  Highly recommended for fans of Tower Defense, RTSs, Table-Top Games, or multi-player with friends! Oh, and for $10? No brainer!",

            "review_text": "I love Tower Defense games so much, and this game is REALLY FUN if you enjoy TD games.   One of the greatest features of this game is you have to actively send out 'creeps' against your opponent while still maintaining your own tower defense line. You also have to manage your income in the form of mines (you can upgrade them task more miners)  The upgrading is very basic, max level 3 for towers; however, there is a good amount of diversity for the macro-upgrading trees. For this, you have to spend both money AND battle points. You get battle points by sending troops out (most likely to die), so playing defensively might not be the best option if your oppnent is beating you in gold and battlepoint revenue.  You can use your towers to make mazes for the creep to pass through, and the feedback showing exactly where the creeps will travel is really helpful. Admittedly, I've taken lessons from the AI's layout.   The learning curve is pretty good despite the extra mechanics, I think the only thing people need to be aware of is how critical getting battlepoints is - balancing your income is key. There is no point of having 10000+ gold if you're waiting on your battlepoints to upgrade your stuff.  Aesthetically, the game is very nice and charming. I'm used to towers getting the most insignificant aesthetic changes in old school TD games, but all of the towers here come with their own newer, badder look. The feedback for enemy health, movement, etc is very seamless - so you can still keep track of how much damage you're doing despite 100 catapults shrouding an enemy (pretty good tactic in all TDs actually - artillery for the win!)  For the price, I would definitely recommend getting it, especially if you're a fan of tower defense games!",

The normal is nothing realy specialy but then again it is good to know that I am bad at tower defence. But 1v1 is intressting.  1v1: Here you play another player you build your maze but you also send minions in to your opponents maze so you have to carefuly balance your resorces and think about how much is worth sending in cause if you send to weak units your enemy just get easie reasurces.  Maps: There is if you ask me abit to few maps so if you pick random you have a big chance of playing the same over and over but on the possetive side is that your mines thjat give you gold are not placed in the same way every time so you have to adapt to each layout.  Summery and own thoughts: It is fun to play 1v1 but other then that it is a tower defence and I am bad at them so I am not the best judge of this game but it has fun gameplay varried units and towers. If you are going to pick this up play it with a friend you will have alot more fun. Good luck and defend your castle.",

Atleast it only cost me £2.74 for me and my friend, I would have been way more upset if I payed the full price of £10.99.

Let me show you:  Screenshot   To build a tower you have to click and hold the mouse button, then you have to circle through a menu and release the button. Hoping you did not select the wrong one. The same setup is done for upgrading and selling, which can often lead to annoying situations.  I don't like my games to be tedious. I do not understand why there is no option to change the settings: Upgrade -&gt; shortcut u, sell -&gt; shortcut s. Simple stuff like this. The game is quite fast paced and the interaction to build/upgrade/sell a tower is really slow because of this setup.  Furthermore, I do not find the towers very balanced. The costs seem extremely mixed. Rather than different towers with different effects for roughly the same cost (Think of Kingdom Rush). So diversification of towers is more a cost matter than what troops the enemy sends you.  As a result, this game could not interest me. As reflected in my playing time.",

It might just be me too but I found the game incredibly difficult (though judging from other reviews I'm not alone), I personally wasn't even able to beat the first level with where you battle against a plank, that's right, A PLANK!  Aside from the difficultly, the game did have some rather humorous moments and the I really liked the graphic style and the tutorial level did a really nice job of explaining things.  Other than that I would like to include another person's review, Drunk Bear Man, because it sums up how I feel about the game as well:  '6/10  It's a unique kind of mix-up to the Tower Defense genre, where you have to defend using towers like always... AND send out units to act as enemies FOR the opposing team, who has to defend themselves by building their OWN towers. If it would have been a perfect game, it would have gotten a 10 for a really cool mix-up of the genre. But sadly, it's far from perfect. This game has a VERY steep learning curve, and when it was first released it had virtually no singleplayer until they updated it, but guess what? The first bot for singleplayer is hard if you don't know what the hell to do, and the description for it says otherwise! Also, there isn't that much variation and only 10 bots to fight against, meaning this game is predominantly multiplayer, which I honeslty don't like for the TD genre. '",

You'll have to figure out your maze on the fly, and with the slighty randomized landscape each playthrough, you won't be able to pull off exactly the same super efficent maze that you did the game before this one, keeping things fresh and forcing you to think. Not to mention you'll have to mull over the best way to line up units to abuse your opponent's maze, with plenty of unit variety and specs to give you a wide variety of options and dirty things to try to slip through it.  It's a great game, but it's best played as single games between long periods. The games can go rather long if both people are competent.
