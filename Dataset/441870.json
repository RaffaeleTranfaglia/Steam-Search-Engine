            "review_text": "As the game is now, I cannot recommend it. The gamepad support is broken. You need the boost ability, but it doesn't work with a gamepad. That means after the very cool and promising intro you start the game, and die after 10 seconds. No matter what you do, you always die after exactly 10 seconds. Then you switch to keyboard and realize what was going on. The boost simply doesn't work with the controller. But you need the boost to survive. Ok, so I played a few minutes with the keyboard, but it just didn't feel right. The sensitivity is way off, you're just not able to control the car very well. It feels horribly. The drift is also pretty bad. The game has an interesting idea (keep up the speed or your girl dies), a simple but nice art style, and dynamic, speed-dependent music - but the controls eliminate every bit of enjoyment you might have gotten out of it. If they work on this, it might turn out to be a decent game in the future, though. I will give it another try at some point.",

OutDrive itself is shallow. It has some potential for being a decent arcade style game if they ever decide to update it, 'Race the Sun' for example takes this same 'battery powered car' concept and adds endless randomly generated obstacles giving you a real sense of acomplishment for getting a high score. Getting a high score in OutDrive is the equivilent of one of those radio contests to see how long you can keep your hand on a car... but by yourself. The game is just not challenging enough to keep you engaged for very long.  Also, gamepad support needs help.  OutDrive is a very stylish soundtrack out of 10.",

I guess it's because I'm not used to playing car games with WASD keys mapped to move the car. - Boring gameplay. Seriously, you just drive a DeLorean at a stable speed the whole time, with some twists, turns, and roadblocks at times. - A tutorial was never added in the game, so you don't know how to play. This would force you to either A: smash every button until you do something right, or B: go online and look it up. This could've been avoided easily. - Rather awkward 'game over' screen. If you fail the game, it instantly ends showing a picture of a man carrying her dead girlfriend (which is also the cover art of this game) with the subtitles reading 'GIRL DEAD'. - Game overall just looks unfinished. It's not even Early Access anymore.",

The problem with this game is in the controls and the handling of the car. The controller support is very sketchy and the Keyboard and mouse feels more like gliding on a sled then driving a car not to add in I am not sure if there is any reverse feature in case you run into a wall or a pile of cars. The game does have some stuttering problems also even on a over recommendation computer.  The idea that this is a project made for the music is kind of a joke also because the music is constantly interupted by having to turn the boost on and off to keep the heart rate gauge in the correct range. If you like the music I would suggest just buying it rather then the game.",

            "review_text": "(This game was suggested by Zaraki Snakenoman and provided by  Freegamesinfo.net  . Thanks, guys!)  On first glance, it feels like Rad Racer from NES. A game from my childhood. I booted it up and saw that eerie little window that shows up before you open a game asking me for my graphic preferences. I then am able to access the game.....no....no dear god, NO!!!!! 'Made with Unity personal edition'.  Well, the story's simple even though the text goes off screen, and no matter the resolution, the relatively quick scrolling text vanishes on the left and right sides of the screen. Basically, you end up in a gunfight while on a date with your girlfriend. During the gunfight, your girlfriend gets fatally wounded. In order to spend more time in her last moments of life, you hook her up to the car's engine to act as her life support. After that, the game begins. The goal of the game is about survival. Go too slow, the girl dies. Go too fast, the engine overheats, the girl dies. The controls feel awkward and the game needs polishing.  Although everything I've said so far is negative, there is good news. The graphics look good and the music sounds sweet.....until you overheat or go too slow, to where it sounds like distorted garbage.  This game is on the right track to being something decent in unity, but it needs a lot of polishing before it can be something good. $3 is not justified here. Not yet, at least.   3/10",

After watching him fumble with the controls and thinking i could do better i decided to purchase. Realising after the first minute that infact the game is far easier to controll than he'd made out, i settled in and really began to enjoy it. Reading the reviews below i see that many peope think that OutDrive has been plagiarized from another game in development and i have to admit i had to chuckle to myself. Dont get me wrong i clearly see the resemblance. However i have to apreciate the irony of calling out a game for plagiarizing another game who is in turn plagiarizing every good idea and design of the 1980's  To the developer of OutDrive.... I love this ! i love the style, i love the feel, i love the sound and i want more! Please continue with this and develop it further. I would apreciate higher quality audio and procedurally generated levels would be great, some other traffic with maybe light car combat i feel would also work. Maybe have a look at 'spy Hunter' from the 80's. One of my all time favorite arcade games.",

The best part about this game is the audio, and to punish the player by pulling them out of the amazing soundtrack they were listening to only because they drifted incorrectly is a terrible mechanic. If they can rework that single problem, I wouldn't mind holding my WASD/space keys down for an hour on this neon lit road towards the neon sun. OutDrive doesn't have controller support yet, and the game's resolution is a bit hard to get right. I hope that the developers intend to fix this soon because I would love to play this game often.   Although I didn't live through the 80's, it definitely has that vibe, and if you enjoyed Hotline Miami, you'll enjoy this game. OutDrive has a lot of potential, and it's a must buy for the current price. The soundtrack itself is worth much more than that, and so are the aesthetics.

This game had a 'TON' of potential to be put, it`s sad that it doesn`t even have complete 'stages', they`re just a segment of every stage you can be respawned at, now, it would make it more fun if it had achivments, like 'Rift for 10 seconds' or 'Use your turbo for 1 minute'...but it seems like a uncompleted game...  -The designs makes it, i will only recommend this game to the only ones who likes 'Retro Aesthetics', over all, Good job on the game, and if this game was the first game ever made by the 'dev', then congratulations, you are 3 steps more further than anybody else who is starting to design games  -This game absolutely deserves a 6/10, not more nor less, '6/10'  (P.S: This should have the entire soundtrack of the movie 'Drive', it will match amazingly well)",
