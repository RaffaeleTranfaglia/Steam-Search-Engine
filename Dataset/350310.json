            "review_text": "As of now I would not recommend this game purely because of the awful, AWFUL port.   -Runs at 30 FPS on an OC'd i5-4690k (@4.4GHz), 8GB of RAM and a GF GTX 760, on LOW settings. FPS is then mostly stable, but dips below that occasionally. -Crashes a LOT - crashed twice in the 40 minutes i spent with it. -Does not have button or key prompts - good luck guessing which button is what (you can check in the settings, but the controller buttons are all 'Button -number-') -Vsync has two settings, one of which locks it to 30, but there is no way of knowing that without trying it -Config program defaults to Japanese. The language is changed in the config program. In Japanese. Do you see the problem? This wouldn't be so much of a problem if most people's PCs didn't change Japanese to gibberish.  I cannot judge the actual game, because it is unplayable. Shame on Koei for this port. After DW8 I was reasonably optimistic (...yeah, i know), but this is terrible.",

            "review_text": "Let's start with the games is optimised fairly badly so if you don't have a powerful machine it will not run well. I have a high end graphics card with a powerful CPU and on max settings I still don't get a guarenteed 60 FPS. The game on launch is in Japanese but there is a community guide on how to change it on steam.   The price is also a big negative however as no game should really be at this price and not be able to last the test of time. If it is on sale I recommend it, but as it is I would say wait for a sale.   First of all if you have played the original Bladestorm it is fairly similar but looks better has another campaign as well as a few new mechanics and features.  Secondly, the setting. It is based in a very romanticised version of the 100 years war so it will have troops which weren't present such as ninjas, barbarians and magic. Do not expect a realistic game it is Koei Tecmo.  Thirdly, the game allows you to select units into battle and later on you got take extra commanders in and form armies.   Finally difficulty, as it stands there is almost no difficulty. If you want to speed through the game go through the nightmare mode untill you get guns and then go through a few missions with as many commanders as you can with guns form an army and victory is easy. You can use the same character in the other campaign and keep the previously gained levels books and pages.  Pro -  New army and commander system Large Maps Freedom to ignore orders and charge into random castles and villages to capture Many different unit types to choose from 2 campaigns to choose from Nightmare mode is interesting with the fantasy elements and still in the period of the 100 years war, not many games allow you to charge across the French country side with a horde of goblins  Cons -  Crap optimisation Sometimes units bug out and combat doesn't work right AI pathfinding messes up and some units will get caught on scenery or a random huge guy which I am sure is meant to be in nightmare mode appears in the normal game Overpriced",

As a fan of the KOEI Hack &amp; Slash games I can recommend it because of it's unique gameplay.  P.S. yes, horses are too much overpowered - CHARGE! CHARGE! CHARGE!     Tech problems:  1. game launches in japanese by default  To run the game in english -text and voice- start the configuration, go to second tab bottom and change value to english (press middle button below the language selection to 'confirm'). Game and even configuration menu are now in english once restarted.  2. game crashes shortly after starting a scenario  Set file Launch_EA.exe (english) or Launch_JP.exe (japanese) to Win 7 compatibility mode.  Once these issues were fixed there were no tech problems anymore.",

            "review_text": "Going into this I only had one real question. Is it like Dynasty Warriors? Short answer: No. There are elements you will know from other Warrior titles but This game differs in one key aspect. You are not a badass warrior who wipes out 1000s of soldiers per battle single handedly. Instead you are a commander of a squad of soldiers and your Squad, with you along side them, fight hordes of enemies.  I went into it thinking the squad was just a neat gimmick but I would still be attacking wiht my main character. Instead you issue generic fight commands and decide the opportune times for your entire squad to unleash a special attack. You lose a bit of the flair and spectacle you get in the other Warrior games but it is replaced with a battle that is larger in scale.   Your individual character, while important, is nowhere near as lionized as any character from traditional wariror series. You play as a mercenary that you personally create similar to how you create custom officers in other Wariror games. You will find your armor sets to be very limited in character creation but that is because pieces of armor have actual statistical effects. In the course of the game you will buy armor and equiping it changes your appearance. There are main characters but you never play as them, as far as I can tell, instead they appear in certain battles and will be fighting alongside, or against, you. You are very much made to feel as a cog in a giant war machine in the endless battles of the Hundred years war.   So to ask 'is this like Dynasty Warriors?' is actually a mroe complicated question than a short yes or no can provide. I'm a huge fan of the Warrior series and have only had problems with one game due to porting issues rather than the game itself. I feel at home in this game coming from that background but the changes may turn off some who like the more story driven focus on specific characters. To me the change is a refreshing new take on the Warriors gameplay and an intersting new setting. I actually think it feels better having a group of people fighting instead of just having 1 single guy completely annialate armies.  I know alot of reviews and the forums have alot fo talk about performance issues playing the game. I have not had any issues. I have an i7 950 and a GTX 960 video card. Everything defaulted to medium settings and I've seen no reson to fiddle with it. That said I generally dont get all hot and bothered over maxing out my graphics. I prefer good story and gameplay.",

            "review_text": "First, this is a great game on ps4 and I want to say that I've played it on ps4 for almost 100 hours, I bought this game only because I wanted to play it in 1080 resolution, however, after I tried to set its graphic to high, it is truly much better than ps4 ver ONLY IF YOU CAN PLAY IT IN HIGH GRAPHIC SETTING WITHOUT CRASH AND LAG, because of this reason, I consider this game kind of very poor pc optimized, and if you set most of graphic options to medium, the outcome would be much worse than ps4 ver, in addition, once you change the language in configure, you will find out a fact, which is this game's saves CANNOT WORK FOR BOTH JAPANESE VER AND ENGLISH VER, it is TOTALLY STUPID design and I don't know how could KOEI think it is ok to be like this, so I suggest people who want to buy this game, should stay away until KOEI release more update patchs for this game, or just play ps4 ver if you have one.",

            "review_text": "Bladestorm is great because you get to watch everyone worship Joan of Arc for her heroic deeds while you pretend like she's not just going to be burned at the stake like some common witch at some point in her immediate future.  Also, the additional Nightmare mode this port is known for is really good, and you get to realize that the events of Soul Calibur begin because Joan of Arc thought humanity should believe in themselves. Silly teenagers.  The ports a bit wonky if you turn off vsync and starts crashing, so if you dislike 30 FPS then get ready for a lot of reloading. Also, the game is pretty average, so expect slightly more strategic Dynasty Warriors.  Also, get Rogue Ninjas, because they are the best.",

If you're using Avira Antivirus, it will block this game however, simply just 'right click' Avira on the taskbar and click and uncheck 'Enable Real Time Protection' whenever you run the game, and remember to on Avira again after you finished playing.  If the Game 'still' crash however, simply open up the 'Configuration' again, hop on to the 2nd tab and 'Off' the movie, I believe most of Koei games have problem running the movie in most rig settings (Happen to me all the time)  The game is pretty much okay, you can create your own 'Custom' officer, much of the templates of the 'edit' are pretty much familiar if you're a big fan of dynasty warriors, but better graphics.  The control are slightly different from Dynasty Warriors, this is less 'button mashing' compared. So I would recommend you check your 'bind keys' before you start the game, even if you familiar with Koei games (unless you have a controller) xD",

But I went ahead anyway and I'm glad I did, When I installed the game, I wasn't able to play because the screen would turn black while in map or in the tavern. I thought I made a huge mistake. But before I got crazy, I messed with the graphical settings and solved my issue. I had to turn off reflection completely and now the game runs flawlessly. This may not fix every issue, but it worked for me. That is a bit annoying to have to do, and to be fair $60 is a bit steep for this game, but if you are a fan of the console version of the hundred years war, you get that plus a whole new campaign in nightmare. I recommend this game to fans, not someone just looking for something new. Also be willing to mess around with the graphical settings. I am running the game on high everything but with reflection off. That solved my issue where I could hear the game sound but see only black and tares of color. Hope this helps.",
