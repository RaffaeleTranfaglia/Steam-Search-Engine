            "review_text": "This game oscillates so much between nice and dumb things. The bosses fights are soemwhat nice but everyhing that is before it feels completely lazy, dull and useless and put there for the sake of not having just boss fights. The levels consist of a single path and an additionnal 'hidden' area and two hidden things to gather to unlock more power, usually found in unfair and lame traps that will make you replay the entire level just for them, if you can find them. It's lame because you can't really find them even when entering the alternative path so you just shoot at everything you can while spamming your jump.  So, for the levels themselves, without bosses ; well it's just bad. You just run from left to right killing things and that's it. There is no fun platforming and not much of fun enemy fighting. They can be easy to beat or hard and then it's just because they are lame and kill you unfairly because you can't expect them or they respawned behind you. To describe how the levels are stupid, just know that the 'first' one (there is no actual mandatory order, you can choose to play the first available levels freely) makes you gather keys to unlock doors blocking your path. And how did they make this ? One key is just above a door that you have to jump on some platforms above to get and then you come down and that's it. ALL the others are just right IN FRONT of the doors. WTF ? WHY ? Why the hell would you put a door in the first place if it's to put the key unlocking it right before it IN A SINGLE STRAIGHT AND UNIQUE PATH ? You just run to the right and your character picks up the key and then go through the door ! That's just completely dumb.  The energy system feels very restrictive and punishing more than helping. As you gather power from defeated enemies you may unlock temporary abilities and power ups, in a set order and while a block of power is fully charged and before the next one is. So say you got Speed / Wings / Line / Comet / Power and the bar is completely filled up to Wings and half Line, then you unlock Wings when activating it. If it's filled up to Speed and half to Wing, then you unlock Speed when activating it. The Line and Comet are two different types of bullets your character kills the enemies with, and Power adds more power to the current bullet type in use. But if you pick up Line while you were in Comet, it becomes Line lv 1 no matter what level Comet was, and same for Line to Comet. So that's an actual downgrade you have to work, and grind for thorough the level, making the monsters respawn to buff yourself before fighting the boss. And if you die, you lose all these upgrades and have to unlock them again by grinding enemies all over again or when hitting a boss..  And that's not it. You unlock more bullet types from defeated bosses. The problem is that they are clunky to use AND deplete your energy bar very fast ! So you just have to stick to Line or Comet forever and eventually use the additionnal bullet types on boss fights only..  As for the boss themselves, it's a bit mixed. They can be very stupidly unfair, throwing attacks with no landmark or anything (like the cat girl), and once you know their patterns they're a walk in the park and you can beat them in mere seconds without any upgrade at all, at least for the first ones, as the following are just plain lame and unfair. They have different patterns that change and 'improve in power' as the fight goes and they happen randomly, either by the action the boss chooses to take, or by the action itself that has many different possible patterns in itself, so it's not always the same thing and it always stays fresh.  So this game is not that bad, the boss fights are Ok and some people will find them challenging. There is replayability through in-game achievements (on the 3DS version too) that challenge you with diverse goals and it's not your usual 'Launch the game' or 'Do an attack' kind of achievements. The graphics and musics are nice and chara design is Ok. But the levels feel very uninspired, lazy and unnecessary, so much that they just look like cheap placeholders, along with the power up system, to wrap the bosses with, and I find that disappointing a lot because the game visually looks nice and the musics are cool and would have been so much better with decent levels and more depht instead of these failed stuffs.  There are other annoying things such as the camera.. ooh I hate that camera. It takes aaaaaaaaages for it to scroll while the game expects you to react fast to things and actually is a part of why the game is lame since the enemies take advantage of it to throw stuffs at you when you can't see it ! They did put options with two variables for the camera but neither of them fixes anything.. We need to unlock the Hard difficulty so it's a bit annoying too but since it's different from normal.. it's Ok I guess. And we are able to block projectiles with some kind of jump but the game does not explains well how to do it and what is a 'projectile' according to it so you happen to save your encounter with a fortunate block that you did not even mean in the first place, but you don't really try to use it on purpose. I personally just dodge everything and it seems like the game works with that, so there is not even a need to block stuffs.  I find that the game is a big disappointment and has many flaws but at the same time it's cute and it's just enough for it to have some sort of fun and replayability and the bosses save everything. I would have liked more depth into the game universe via levels that don't feel like an insult like 'just so we can say we did some stuff', with actual platforming and things to explore and unlock in them, with several paths (more than one and a single alternative, usually behind a trap that hides a crystal) and enemies that are not insanely lame and I get hit because I have to.   Also having to pay money to have the game musics as playable files is very low and lame. That thing should just be illegal that's it. It shows even more they cared more about money and quantity than quality.  All in all it's a nice little game that looks promising but sadly lacks of a lot of content and consistence and has several annoying flaws. So yeah, disappointing but a bit nice at the same time.",

            "review_text": "This is not the best game, but it is not a bad game either. It seems to more or less be a port from the 3DS, which is significantly better than a mobile port that tries to translate taps and swipes into mouse movements. It is similar to Megaman with some RPG elements thrown in for flavor. Kill a boss, steal its weapon, another boss is weak to your new toy, rinse repeat.  The game starts out... odd. It opens in a tiny window that you can change when you hit the options, I turned full screen on and never had that issue again. It also starts by dropping you into a black screen that tells the controls, stays on that for a few seconds then goes to the title screen, no screens to tell who made the game or anything.   There are 3 difficulties, Hard is unlocked by beating the game on Normal first. There is an unlockable character, which I don't have yet, although I hear they play differently. And various goodies by beating levels/the game certain ways. The options menu has a few interesting things on it besides the normal stuff. Screen scrolling time (up and down, left and right) and jumping options (either always the same height or varies by how long you hold the button). Nothing really special to mention, it's an option menu.  The story is sparse, very sparse. If you are looking for a deep story this is so not the game for you. The mcguffins have disappeared, you are trying to find the mcguffins. Hunt down bosses, ask about mcguffin, fight. That is about it.  The music is decent, nothing bad but in all honestly I can't remember a single song I've heard. There is some minor voice acting, but it is only before a boss fight, and unless you speak Japanese you're not going to know what was said as there's no subtitles for the lines.   The game looks nice! All the sprites are nicely designed, although some are used multiple times (I have seen at least 3 variations of the 'pitchfork man', palette swap and different attack pattern). The levels all look different and are fitting of the theme of the area. At the beginning of each level it is like you're in a VR world/hologram until you hit a white line then everything switches over to the area's design... which has not been explained. The game also runs at a smooth 60FPS on my system, and I so do not have a good system, so it should run very nicely for most people.  And now the most important part! The controls and how it plays! The controls are obviously a port over from the 3DS. If you've ever played a flash game the keyboard controls should be easy enough to pick up. ZXCV are your attack, jump, install(upgrade), and attack menu. AS let you quick swap to the previous/next attack type. Arrows are movement. The spacebar of all bloody things is the pause button, which makes absolutely zero sense to me. In every other game pause is either escape or P, why is it the spacebar here? The controls can NOT be changed. Ok, I take that back, they can... you can change which of the ZXCV keys does what, you can not change the movement keys, pause, or the next/previous weapon keys. The game also has controller support, which I did not try out, but I imagine work just fine seeing as the original game was designed for a system that has a controller. Any prompts given in game are taken straight from the 3DS version, so expect it to say 'hit the A/B/X/Y key to do this'.  You can autofire by holding the attack button, and that will clear the way through most of any given level. That is actually a little disappointing. There are hazards to dodge, and some enemies that you can't hit without either a weapon upgrade/change or waiting for their shield to drop, but autofiring will get you through a majority of any given level. I've gotten hurt more on hazards that were hard to dodge than any non-boss enemy. Autofiring will not work on the bosses, they get invincibility frames and their attacks are harder to dodge than the trashmobs in the levels. There is also a blocking mechanic that is poorly explained in game. Pretty much you perfect guard by tapping left or right (doesn't matter which) right as a projectile would hit you. Get it right and you get a small amount of XP and don't get hit, get it wrong and you lose a chunk of XP and lose some HP. You're better off dodging the attacks in my opinion.  There are also plenty of instant kill pits around, and you get knocked back when hit, so you can see where that goes.   DO NOT Alt+Tab out of the game or it closes the game entirely! Shift+Tab works just fine, but Alt+Tab closes out the window for some reason. Oh, and to exit the game it tells you to Alt+F4... which I find cute.  The leveling system is interesting. You gain XP (tres) from killing enemies and it fills the bar at the bottom of the screen, and if you want the upgrade that is highlighted in red you hit the install key to use up all the XP to get it. You can't get previous ones if a higher level one is highlighted. The install upgrades are temporary and are gone if you die/finish a level. Also any XP not used you can use outside of levels for permanent upgrades which include more lives, get more XP from enemies, more HP, upgrades to weapons, etc. Your special weapons, the ones you steal from bosses, use XP as their ammo, so fire them wisely if you're trying to get an upgrade. Oh, and since I mentioned HP, there are no health items. If you get hit that HP is gone until you die or finish the level.  Overall I like the game, it's fun and challenging and the bosses are great fun to fight. I find the life system arbitrary, especially since I lose all my temporary upgrades and most of the XP bar upon death. But that aside I'll be finishing this game. And remember, don't Alt+Tab!",

            "review_text": "It's megaman with a gradius-style power-up system. It sounds like a great idea on paper, but it's very poorly executed. The primary issue is that the way the game sets up checkpoints works directly against the player, because it only recovers their position, and not the upgrades they had at that point. This means that, when you reload a checkpoint, you're effectively starting from that point of the game at a severly under-powered state. On top of this, the game is clearly lacking a lot of polish. Translation is clumsy, there are a lot of game objects that feel like they're missing animations, sound quality is a mixed bag, level pacing is awkward, etc.... At the end of the day, it's not an offensively terrible game, but it's too mediocre to be worth recommending. There are plenty of games out there which are far more deserving of your time and money.",

I didn't care for the playstyle of the second character you unlock after clearing the game, and as of the time I'm writing this review, fullscreen doesn't quite work like it should. But this game is still well worth picking up on sale if you like anime-themed platformers.",

            "review_text": "I dislike the combination of how the camera restricts your ability to hit enemies and that you can't act after taking damage until you land (or fall to your death). One or the other is fine, but both feels unfair with the only work around being memorization. Having to adjust my view (so I can tell if it's not a bottomless pit) sort of breaks the immersion for me.  I also feel that certain enemies were introduced poorly with too many hazardous variables and far too late in the stage to be doing that type of thing.   Dialogue is fully voiced.  Enemy mooks could do with more variety per stage, but the ones that do exist are interesting in their own right.  360 Controller support duly noted.  With that being said, and as a platformer enthusiast, I don't regret buying this.",
