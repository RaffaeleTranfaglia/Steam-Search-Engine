Nam is pretty much Duke Nukem fighting alien scum in the city, but instead, it is changed into a World War theme and you are Sergeant Westmoreland bringing down soldiers in the Viet Cong. You can pretty much die easily if you dunno what to do, so as the game says; survive!  8/10 is what I give for this game.",

I am interested in vietnam and almost any game involving the war. Some one on the NAM discussions gave it to me as they heard about my interest. I have to say for being the first DOS game I've ever played, it plays great! Many have a problem with the controls but to me they are fine. It was clunky at first but I finally got to use the lonely arrow keys! I'm only on the second mission but I have to say it is hard and some deaths don't make sense but it is fun.  If anyone bought this game or are going to buy this game i'll be writing a guide soon to the controls and some hints i've noticed.  TL:DR For a DOS game the controls are clunky at first but then actually make sense after you get used to it. The game is hard. You will die.",

Follow Up   Always follow-up with a thank you note reiterating your interest in the position. You can also include any details you may have forgotten to mention during your interview.
