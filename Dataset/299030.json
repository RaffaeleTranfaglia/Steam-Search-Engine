            "review_text": "Nearly two decades after release, and Blood still remains perhaps the finest game Monolith Productions bestowed upon undeserving mankind - and, considering they produced many a fantastic and unique first person game, several of them being among my personal favourites - that is definitely telling something.  Blood is a darkly humorous and often morbid, long and, even by 90s FPS standards, challenging journey.  You'll fight your way through huge, thematically and visually extremely varied, highly atmospheric and intricately designed levels filled with references to (or sometimes directly based on) famous pieces of horror cinema and literature. Large arsenal of weapons is on player's disposal, ranging from your standard FPS pieces like shotgun and machine gun, to a pretty creative stuff like a can of hairspray used in conjunction with a lighter that turns your unfortunate enemies into pretty flames, to a voodoo doll and several different types of dynamite. Every single weapon is insanely fun and satisfying to use, in a way that is rarely seen today.  This game is simply a must play for any at least semi-serious FPS fan. Blood's best qualities were untouched by time, and it is sure to satisfy anyone who likes a fun and challenging FPS. Blood is also a perfect example of that sheer creativity and quality of game design that is sadly all but gone from modern FPS games.",

Where as Duke Nukem 3D is a throwback to 80's action movies and Shadow Warrior is a parody of kung-fu movies, Blood is a tribute to horror movies.  The game's levels are moody and dark, and well crafted. Your arsenal includes weapons such as flare guns, tommy guns, dynamite, voodoo dolls and sawn off shotguns.   The game's protagonist is Caleb, once the supreme commander of a cult called 'The Cabal', worshippers of the forgotten god Tchernobog. Caleb is slain by Tchernobog in betrayel and rises from his grave one faithful night to seek vengence.  There are many references to horror movies, such as Nightmare on Elm's Street, Friday the 13th, The Shining, Psycho and more. The game is quite possibly the best Build engine game in my opinion.  Unlike the re-ports of Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior, Monolith never released the source code for Blood, and thus source ports were never made. This is pretty much the  gog.com  version, which runs on DosBox, which runs just fine on my Windows 7 64-bit.",

There are tons of references to major horror films such as The Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2, Return of The Living Dead, The Shining, Jaws, Frankenstien and many more. The plot is pretty simple, you got screwed over by the devil or something and you want to make him pay...preferably by choking him with his own intestines. The game is a simple Doom clone but with a little more 3-D rendered objects, for example, the keys, weapons, and some pickups are actually 3-D models and not 2-D sprites. The gore is pretty high in this game as well, so if you like that well here you go. I have a couple complaints with older games like this is, one of them is that it has to run in DOS-Box, however DOS-Box is prepacked with the game so you don't have to go and download it, just install and play. Another gripe is that when I am playing I can't find a way to use the mouse for aiming so I have to stick with awkward controls. Besides those small issues the game holds up pretty well today. Go check it out, it's pretty cheap so it won't break the bank. 8.5 out of 10.",

The areas and graphics are really detailed for the time, even though there are FAR more superior than this game, I can't deny the fact this is a classic old school FPS that everyone should play. Even if the story doesn't really make sense, but violence and blood (duh) is perfect for every step of the way. Downsides, it can get tough, and you will be pulling your hair at times when you die way to much. Also, the controls will take some time to get use to.

            "review_text": " What I liked about the game    • I really liked the horror theme. There were some amazing levels; like the Dark carnival, into the flesh and Crystal Lake. An excellent game to play on Halloween.  • Caleb is an awesome protagonist who has a creepy voice, who comes out with cheesy one-liners.  • Plenty of secrets to be found and there are also secret levels (I only found one). There are Easter eggs throughout the game as well (references towards films or series).  • Bizarre weapons to use against the undead. You get weapons like the pitchfork, flare gun, Tesla Canon and the Napalm Canon.  • Loads of awesome enemies to slaughter. You get to fight zombies, demons, hell hounds, and ghosts. Sometimes when you kill your enemy you get to pick up their heart which gives you extra health. Cool and changeling boss fights, especially when you fight Tchernobog.  • Useful power ups, like the deep sea diving suit and a power up that lets you duel wield weapons.  • The game can sometimes be hilarious. It's like the evil dead of video games.    What I disliked or was disappointed with    • I wasn't keen on this version. I had to do a lot of messing around with the options before I could get started with the game. I had to change the controls and activate mouse aim. I also had to download a launcher so I could play Cryptic Passage.  • Blood is very challenging game, far more challenging than Duke Nukem and Shadow warrior. I had to turn down the difficulty. I advise you to save frequently, because you will get killed a lot, even when you least expect it, for example the door can kill you. • The soundtrack is good, but it does get repetitive.    Conclusion    A fantastic game. I enjoyed playing this on Halloween. They should a redux version of this game. If you enjoyed Duke Nukem and Shadow warrior, I highly recommend you play this. You get a lot for your money. 90/100  ",
