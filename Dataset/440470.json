            "review_text": "Sadly, I can't recommend this title at this time. I feel like I need to give it a shot after a few months(and hopefully patches). Though this may simply fall into the 'Not for me' category personally.  As you can see I don't even have an entire hour logged. This is not so much due to bugs as it is the frustration that I've dealt with in this game.   I really wanted to like this game.  It has a lot of potential, but I feel like it sort of missed the mark for me. I'm not bothered by the length or aesthetic at all. Just the actual game itself.  It wasn't fun that running kills is lethal. I feel like you already walk painfully slow but to be forever bound to moving so slowly everywhere was making me batty. I like to explore a lot so moving slowly can be very problematic when I'm trying to get back to what I was doing before I wandered off.   Second, I kept dying to some strange beast creature that would spawn on top of me, knock me over, and appeared to be humping my unconscious face. This isn't a git gud situation. Sometimes pursuit music would play when it was following me, but more often than not it wouldn't. This left me feeling not scared but very confused about how this thing keeps spawning on top of me and one-shotting me.   I am a huge fan of horror games and honestly it doesn't take much to scare me at all. But this game only came off as mildly spooky because I couldn't get past the frustration.   It looks like there were a few who were able to complete the game without having the same problems as me which is cool. :)   I didn't have the same experience though so it's gonna be a no from me until some changes are made(if at all).",

            "review_text": "The game was a little short and the story is a bit hard to put together. Careful attention to the notes and audio logs pieces it together. You have to figure out what is going on for yourself. This game does not lead you by the hand. I jumped out of my chair a couple of times. The health mechanic took a second for me to get used to, seems this girl can scare herself to death, literally. Overall I enjoyed the experience. You can tell the developer is a little inexperienced. If your looking for a good scare, play this in the dark with little sound in the room.",
