            "review_text": "This game is old, showing its age, and may not be supported on future operating systems well. As an example, the IRC program inside doesn't run well with current IRC security protocols (it /does/ connect to real servers.)  But that doesn't mean this isn't a hell of a good game and still pretty much one of a kind.  This game takes inspiration from Hollywood hacking and turns it into an excellent simulation of such. A sandbox roguelike of sorts, you need wits, some planning, and a little luck to become rich, powerful, and save the internet from some bad guys that feel it's time to unplug everything.  I believe Introversion could make a new Uplink with the skills they've gained from games they've created since 2001, and release something truly golden. The market for hacking simulations is pretty much dominated by this decade old game, so something more 21st century would most definitely be a hit.  Until then, enjoy Uplink, and good luck on the net.  Edit: Since I finally realized my review had become one of the most popular, I did a long-needed once over for grammar. Sadly, I'm still waiting for my Uplink 2020 :(",

Now that I am done my shpeal here are the pros and cons (As is necessary for any game review)  Pros: Great and immersive world Amazing story Deaths dont feel cheap* Roguelike You feel like a badass hacker when your hacking is reported on the news Strangely enjoyable paranoia and stress Endless replayability You can tell the devs put their heart and soul into this  Cons When starting out percieved difficulty is increadibly high (Before realising I needed a log deleter I thought the game was unfairly killing me)* Roguelike this can be a turnoff for some people No ability to undelete files if you are carefull this is a non issue (Accidentaly deleted Faith) Some items can be a bit pricy Teaser about Uplink 2 (Multiplayer hacking into other peoples Uplink stuff)... Uplink 2 will sadly never be released  All in all this is 100X better as a hacking game than watchdogs or (Insert relevent hacking game here) and is much less expensive. Now then I have to go deal with some government agents knocking at my door...",

            "review_text": "Unique hacking game by Introversion Software, which currently are the developers of Prison Architect. Uplink was released more than a decade ago, yet it aged well. In the game you're a hacker working for Uplink, a company which employs hackers (agents) providing them with remote gateways, which they connect from their personal computers. You are one of those agents.  The goal is to hack your way into richness, so you can buy the best software and hardware available, and eventually you will receive e-mails offering special missions, which is the plot.  The bad parts is that figuring out how to play the game and hack advanced systems (like Banks, Mainframes and Lans) is a lot of fun, but doesn't offer much replayability once you've got everything figured out. This results in a repetitive feeling. Plus, the plot and it's results are a shallow, leaving the player wanting for more.  It is, still, a great game.  Unfortunately, the developers didn't make a sequel (even though they had planned it), but it's a game you won't forget after you play it.",

This really is the only game of its kind, and I hope that someone will release an updated, more in-depth version with perhaps more features that make this game more visually entertaining as well.

I really like the way hacking is simulated here (no need to type in the same stupid commands over and over again), the depth of the story, the possibilities the game gives you, the way the interface works and the eastereggs and humor within the game. In the original version there were also things hidden outside of the game, e.g. on the CD, the bonus disk and the manual. man 'Uplink Game Bible'.  As my dev-CD of Uplink broke some years ago I seized the chance to get a working Uplink via the steam sale again. Unfortunately the Multi-Monitor option is not available in the steam version of the game and cannot be activated (which can be done in the original version although it was officially removed there, too). Playing Uplink on several screens (all showing different game-related data) is even more movie-hackerish.",

You will spend your first few hours going mission to mission using the exact same password crack, browse files, delete logs. Over. And over. And over... Then there's the constant BEEP, BEEP, BEEP. It makes the game tense because you feel like your teeth are getting drilled. And just like in real life, you have an email inbox full of auto-replies and junk that you have to try and sort through trying to find the file name your supposed to look for on the stupid repetative mission while BEEP BEEP BEEP!!!!!!!!!!  Audio visual atmosphere -   The audio and visuals of the game are non-existant. You'll tell yourself 'that's ok, because I play all kinds of indie 8-bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.' Just don't. Please.  Controls -  I would describe this game as OS hell. The interface is absolute torture. If you actually do any programming, scripting, hacking, or even just know your way around a real OS, the fact that you CANNOT ACTUALLY USE THE KEYBOARD most of the time will make you want to immediately delete this game. Instead you have to click around through the minimalist interface of indeciferable buttons. Image everything you hate about computers, ok, now step in a pile of dog ♥♥♥♥, and that should get you in the ball park of what this game is like.   Summary -  It's like your parents asked you to fix their computer, you know, find the 'funny email thing' they downloaded 10 times but can't find it, only you have to use the mono-chromatic interface from a Nokia brick phone circa 1999 while some one is shreiking in your ear periodically and hitting you in the balls wiht a hockey stick.

That said, the story is flimsy at best and I can't decide which of the two endings is less interesting. Play it until you've got the second or third-best system and hacked each kind of server at least once, then put it down because the rest is extremely repetitive. If you can get it for $5 or less it's worth it. Also it apparently takes place in an alternate universe where there are no women?

The game is fairly difficult to originally get in to, but once you get the hang of it, Uplink becomes addicting. You take contracts to destroy/recover documents, track people's bank accounts, change their status on government documents, steal from banks, etc.    The game is a bit of a grind early on, but picks up pace after doing a few missions. This and the fact that if you    just look up and add all of the servers in the beginning, the game becomes fairly easy as you can bounce your connection between them all (effectively giving you a huge boost of time),    are the only faults I personally find with this game. For $5, this would be a great deal. But in it's current state it just isn't worth the $9.99 price tag.   All in all, I give Uplink a 6.5/10 for it's current price, and 7.5/10 if it was a bit cheaper.

            "review_text": "Uplink is a hacking game with a simple concept: 'The server has type X security system of level Y, so i need an anti-X program of level Y or higher.'  Basically, you're an agent working for Uplink, an organization for freelance hackers worldwide, with services like news, Mission bulletinboard (where you get most of your contracts, jobs, etc.,) and a variety of upgrades including software, hardware and gateway upgrades. By following the news one can inspect what is going on, and can possibly even see one's own actions seen on the news.  The story is fairly simple, a company named ARC is seen doing some suspicious stuff and raises suspicions on the news and between hackers. Later on we see the #1 hacker of Uplink message the player (and every other agent,) telling that when they receive the message, they would be already dead. He then gives a password to an ARC server and wishes them good luck. The player has the choice of involving in the story, starting a 'quest', or completely disregarding the message from the now late agent, essentially skipping the main story altogether.  I see alot of similarities between this game and Hacknet, but the biggest difference is probably the focus of the two games. Hacknet involves a lot of story, while in Uplink it is rather lackluster, as there is more focus on the gameplay.  The gameplay is simple. You buy some software and run them. However, once you start them up, the server will begin a trace. One needs to 'bounce' connections between servers to make a huge 'link,' so that it takes longer to trace. When you are hacking into a server, they will start an active trace. When you disconnect, they will begin a passive trace, trying to use the 'bounce' connection logs to figure out where you are, giving the player a responsibility to remove logs from bounced connections.  The game is very punishing. In the start, when the player does something as simple as deleting files, when they fail a bill comes in the form of an email, telling you to send funds to said account. However, when it is about changing criminal records, hacking bank accounts and destroying computer systems, the federal agents come in. When you are traced to your gateway location, they go out and search for it. This forces Uplink to disavow all information about the player, essentially resulting in a game over.  However, i find the game quite entertaining, as once you progress, the stakes become higher and higher, but hacking becomes easier and easier. One slip-up grants a game over, so you have to be careful of everything you do. I have lost the game multiple times trying to get bank funds from one account to mine. Once you see your mistake, you learn from it, and you become a better player, know what to do so that this or that doesn't happen again.  I recommend this to people who really like something punishing, those who are determined to become a hacker that no one has yet seen. Those who are looking for challenges: the start may be a little hard, but after that it's easy peasy.  I rate this game 9/10.",

Uplink is tough as nails, yet that just makes it more fun. You have to be so careful, so precise, because forgetting to erase a single access log entry can get you caught. The amount of stress involved in each hack, the sheer panic as I hope I crack the password before I get traced feels incredible. The 'atmosphere' (or whatever passes for it in a game made up of menus) is perfect because the game never even admits to being a game. From the moment you log into the game, it feels like you're actually a movie hacker sitting down with your tools, like a young Angelina Jolie preparing to hack the Gibson.  One problem some people might have with the game is that it's very clumsy and difficult to use the interface, and many of the tasks are repetitive. I personally liked that aspect, because there's something great about having to go through the routine every time, knowing that one mistake could be your last. Complacency is your greatest enemy. Besides, the game is about tension, and having to fight against your own tools to optimise heightens that. It also leads to interesting decisions. Should you open your hacking programs one by one, losing precious time in menus? Or should you keep all of your programs running before the hack, but deal with the increased CPU load? By far, the most annoying thing is routing your connection through as many servers as possible before each hack, but at least you can save and load your relays to save time. Still, for me, the difficulty of using the interface adds more realism, as if I'm actually hacking. Things can't all be fun and games when you play a game that's not a game.  One thing I really would love to see, though, is hotkeys. It makes sense that a game based around a computer terminal would have hotkeys for everything. Other than that, this is a splendid game that I have never won, or even come close to winning. I just keep playing because it's that good.

When you're caught, you're caught. Profile destroyed. Everything lost. Learn to play before you play, it will save you hours of pain wondering why you just got disavowed.  Other than the unforgiving style, the gameplay is fun and makes you remember a strict process of what do to before you're done. When the reward is is higher, so is the danger of the job. And that is why I reccomend Uplink.  Unforgiving, strict, and fun all in one package. Although, be warned if you don't like computers atleast a little or repetetive gameplay, because Uplink has demand for both of those.",

            "review_text": "So, a long while back, I wrote a joke review about my experience screwing up a bank job. Instead, I'm going to write an actual review.  Uplink. Where to begin? The hollywood hacking simulator is one of my favorite games, and all the people writing negative reviews on it yelling 'buggy' or 'go buy hacknet its better' Well to that I say, Yes, it is buggy. But it was made in ~2003, and it shows. Yes, it crashes. But the game has a certain charm to it that leaves me with a better impression of it than Hacknet. Granted the newly-in-beta graphical overhaul   UplinkOS   helps alot to make the game more user friendly (and I highly recommend it)  -----Gameplay------ I can say the gameplay is top notch and semi-realistic You have to get a 'bounce' (long linked trail of connections) to get extra time for when the network you're hacking decides to trace you. The thrill of trying to get in, do your job, and get out before the trace kicks you out is exilarating. Then you gotta go to one of the links in your trail, and clean up the logs to get that passive trail off you.  -----Music----- Kind of a minor thing, but the 5 song track list is a nice mix of cyberpunk-ish techno, and fits well with the hacking theme. (its also great to listen to when trying to concentrate on a paper or something)  -----Story----- The story is pretty good, though you don't really have follow it, as you can just continue doing freelance work, as the storyline doesn't require you to follow along.    ARC is up to no good; help them destroy the internet with a virus known as Revelations, or help Arunmor stop them.     10/10",

Definitely not for everyone, though -- there aren't any fancy graphics, and it requires a good bit of typing. Regardless, it will still get your blood pumping as you try to finish your hack before the cyberpolice catch you (especially since getting caught ends your game, making you have to restart from the very beginning every time -- i.e., there's no save points). This was part of an Indie pack I bought (4 games for $5) and it was worth every penny. 10 bucks is definitely too steep for it, but consider grabbing it if it goes on sale again. ",
