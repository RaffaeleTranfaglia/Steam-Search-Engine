The physics are realistic, weapons are not one-shot death-lasers, and if you want any medical attention you will need to emphasize teamwork.

Overall America's Army 3 is a really great game! the graphics aren't the cleanest but the gameplay is very fun and very tatical for any gamers that want a change from Call Of Duty or may not have the money for ArmA 3 I'd give this game 7.5/10 Definitely worth the download!",

It's more difficult to charge in head-on to the enemy as your body armor can only take 1-2 shots before being broken and leaving yourself unprotected. The use of cover is one of the many things that will save you when playing this game, and it slows down the pace of the game itself as you have to move from cover to cover, suppress the enemy, deploy smoke, etc.... For a newcomer to America's Army 3, I would recommend going over the training courses before stepping into a pvp match because the controls are a bit complicated. The one thing that I hope would be fixed on here is the introduction of new weapons and a better class system because there are far too many times that every match I go in, people tend to choose the Squad Designated Marksman role and the only ones left are the rifleman, grenadier, and automatic rifleman.",

The achievement system makes you come back for more, and that is what will make me come back and play this even more. For a free game, AA3 is good, but it could be great. If you are looking for something new to play or you want something that provides a real world perspective, AA3 should be on your list.
