            "review_text": "Well. The Crew... I honestly was dying to get this game, and I dropped the $85 for the gold edition. I figured since I loved racing games to death that this would be the perfect fit for me. But boy was I wrong. I do have a lot of fun on it but beware, the car physics are horrible and the map is sub-par at best. You get this hype from looking at the game that it's going to be awesome with a gigantic map and tons of cities to drive through but then you get in and BAM, there's only 2 cities that are slightly like 10% close to the historic scale of it, and those two are LA and New York. The problems with those are they take up 1/4 of each region they're in. West Coast: 75% nothing, 25% LA. East Coast: roughly 40% New York and 60% Hills and forests. The handling in the game is sub-par too, which I kinda braced for knowing it was on a havok engine. But when you really get into it it's one of the single most disappointing things in the game. Most of the cars either handle like you're steering them with your feet or handle like you crank the wheel over on each turn even if you're trying to only follow slight contours in the road.   +The cars are nice +The map is still nice despite the major lack of any cities between New York and LA +Bonneville Salt Flats is acutally made to a barely historic scale (only for the speed area) +Street cars handle pretty well +Circuit cars are hilarious +Circuit Silverado +HUMMER  -Miserable offroad physics because of the vehicle flipping limitations, Raid car physics leave a lot to be desired -crash cutscenes are the most annoying things ever and tend to take ~15 seconds to go away -Missions are subpar at best -Campaign is linear and not even racing -some of the fastest cars in the game are some of the slowest performance cars (Koeniggsegg Agera R: 279 mph fullstock (amazing buff), and 219mph level 1299 perf tune. Real/recorded top speed: Nowhere near any of these at 263mph) -Between LA and New York the cities are horrible and very half ♥♥♥♥♥, 90% of the giant cities that rival LA are just represented as small towns (Dallas, Washington DC, etc...)  -A lot of major cities aren't even represented in the game (Houston, Phoenix, Glendale, Palm Springs [I know it's in the game but that's like one house, palm springs is a pretty nice place], Denver, etc..) -The game feels like minimal effort was put into it. --Crashes every 1-3 hours, usually during something important like the end mission or a skill --Graphics depend too heavily on shaders and shadowing, not real effort and modelling skills. -Cops are kinda annoying but really not bad any more, updates changed the police and made them hilarious golf balls for Hummers. -Tuning the H1 to Raid spec is horrible because it tunes it like a gas engine. The Duramax LLY diesel tuned to 600hp on a would NOT have only 700lb/ft of torque, it would EASILY be in the 4 digits (around 1,150ft/lb) for torque and it would be unstoppable. Work on diesel engines, then it gets my vote (granted it's an extremely small gripe because I still love the H1 to death ingame) -Mapping is horrible, around Black Mount there are patches of trees floating 5 feet off the ground and trees growing in the middle of the train tracks that the train just drives through, and in New York the storm gutters in the tunnels underground have no collision meshes and your wheels get stuck underground if you hit that area.  My personal thoughts on this is they should put it as an early access game, not a full release game. This release is just.. For lack of better word, it's just not good, it's an incomplete game marketed as a full game.  If they announce they have no plans to do any major revamps I would never recommend this to any of my friends. All in all, The Crew pretty much turned out to be exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be, and that is just another overhyped game that isn't worth the money, destroyed by Ubisoft forcing the game developer to cut a lot of corners and release a broken game  EDIT: My view of the game went up a lot with the addition of the Mini with a circuit tune and a Ford Focus with a Raid tune (the 2 funniest cars in the game now) There were plenty of updates after that but I have neglected to mention them, but it's still not worth paying the full price for, anyone interested should get it while it's on sale.  Another edit: They fixed a lot of the AI issues, the races are extremely easy to win now if you play your cards right. The cops are like golf balls for Hummer golfing.  Still not worth the price tag, though.  Thank you for reading.  The game is getting better but it still leaves much to be desired.  EDIT: 1/27/2016 Also since Wild Run released the game WILL NOT run AT ALL for some reason.  EDIT 11/23/2016 I fixed it and it runs fine, still the same issues and fun things though. Again, not worth the money whether or not it's on sale. UBIsoft even tried to give it away.",

The car handling, as I'm sure you'll read in a thousand negative reviews, is terrible. 260 km/h feels like 100 km/h, rivals and NPC racers seem to rip around the track like they're on rails, and they have absolutely no problem pushing you out of the way while you struggle to change their course even slightly.   The raid events are frustrating, as the vehicle seems to swap ends for what looks like no reason. Off road, every vehicle handles like butter on a hot skillet.   It could have been good, but I think I'm going to turn my Xbone on and stay with Forza. Maybe Ubi should play Horizon 2 and take a page or three from it.",

I have the season pass for The Crew, and it did not come with Wild Run (£14.99) or the newest DLC Calling All Units (£19.99). Now, am I now entitled to take a poo on their doorstep? The season pass only comes with the DLC's that are much cheaper than these new ones. Also the previous large DLC which was Wild Run did not support all of the cars, and the reason for the game having a mostly negative review space is that the game studio is owned by Ubisoft, and Ubisoft have a known reputation for releasing DLC, sorry, WAY TOO MUCH DLC, for a game that feels incomplete without it. It feels as if the updates for this game have been payed for and added in a DLC form, now this game is actually quite a good one, exept for the overpriced nonsense.",

The physics are wonky, the AI is notorious for rubber-banding (which is really noticable in the 1 hour+ 'raid' races), and online everybody is out for blood. That said, I still recommend this game for one real reason: It's spectacularly fun to just drive around.   The map is absolutely massive -- it takes about 45 minutes to drive coast-to-coast, and the best part about it is that it's not locked to where you are in the story. After the first few hours, you get a fairly hefty sum of premium currency -- not enough to buy endgame content like a hypercar, but you can do quite a bit with it, including going well out of your way to buy a car you really want.  If what you want in a car game is the ability to just drive around on a massive, diverse map, I can't think of any game better than The Crew to do it in.",

HOWEVER, I bought the gold edition when it came out, which included the season pass. but DIDN'T include the Wild Run DLC. which, frankly, is stupid. almost ALL new actual content, that would keep me playing the game for things other than just driving around, is in Wild Run.   Dropping more money into a game to get something that should of come with the season pass is just discusting business practice. though, we all know how much to expect from ubisoft.  however, don't let that prevent you from enjoying what is, actually, a really good game. I still manage to have hours of fun in it, literally just driving around exploring the absolutely MASSIVE map. even after I think I've driven around the whole thing, I have still missed spots. And you get a few good hours out of the story, so what I did buy was worth it, even without wild run.   I would buy Wild Run if you were getting it now though, because thats where all the stuff to do is.   EDIT: One other thing I would like to add, This game is what? 2+ years old now? its still getting regular updates, which is actually seriously good, especially for something by Ubisoft.",

            "review_text": "This was one of the games I was looking foward to this year. But it does so little in the areas where it matters most that it falls short of where other existing games pass with flying colors.  Sure I love the visuals of the game and it plays decently well, but the focus of the game is cars and... There's quite a lack of focus in general on them. From what I can see, there's only 40 cars that you can get from dealerships yet this game has one problem that a lot of these style of games have. They tend to favour one or two manufacturers over the rest and that leaves the variety pretty thin, especially when you only have 40 cars and around 1/7th of them are Fords.  Another thing is customization. If you wanted to make awesome murals or just a silly paintjob for your ride, I got two words for you, 'You can't'. The customization feels like it came right from need for speed most wanted (2005) but with even less content then you would even think of. I can't even change the color of my Dodge Viper since there's only 1 color for it and it's terrible.  That's another thing. Everytime I get a racing game, I make it a personal objective to get a Dodge Viper because who doesn't strive to earn their favorite car? But I practically started off with it. You can't buy it but instead, use Uplay award points to buy it and then BAM! Instant car... I already feel like I have nothing to work towards in the game now and I only just started it...  In comparison to Test Drive Unlimited 2. This game has much greater visuals and world design and also doesn't have those annoying houses that make it take forever to manage your cars. But lacks in everywhere else like car selection veriaty, customization and pay to win mechanics. Yes, this game has paid for currency in it which you can use to buy skill points that give passive benefits to your stats or immediate access to any car.",

            "review_text": " Driving and diving / Ecco the Golfin   I've grown to love  The Crew . I play it like an underwater diving game, only on land. Turn on the soapy ingame ambient radio. Dial down the engine sounds. Switch off the player tag cloud that shows which people are nearby. Mark a place on the map I want to go to. And then it's just peaceful gliding through landscapes of varying quality. Some are blander than others, sometimes the trees look like big matches stuck in the ground.  I mostly enjoy the different kitschy light situations. Sunrise, sundown,  The Crew's  sun always finds new ways to surprise me and to colour everything in different ways.  The MMO part, or let's say, the social component, seems like a total failure to me. I never saw anybody use the chat, unlike in  TDU2 , where people would often park their cars somewhere and have little group conversations that made it clear there were actual people in these cars. The only human contact I had during my 30 hours with  The Crew  was players trying to ram me into oblivion. Maybe it's my fault, but whilst  TDU2  was  The Sims  on wheels,  The Crew  seems to attract a crowd that's more into, well, driving, not chatting. That's okay, I guess. I enjoy driving. I wish more of my friends on Steam would take the plunge, but then again, driving around together could be very boring, I don't know? I suppose one has to be a proper bore to find diving-driving interesting.  I play  The Crew  to relax and the game is successful at that.",

            "review_text": "So, The Crew:  Basically they took the idea of NFS Rivals and improved it, added a storyline, and optimized it better. The idea is that the game is always online. Any time you play it you will be able to see other people and even CO-OP with them.   So is it better than NFS Rivals? Two words: Hell yes! It is better optimized for the PC, more customzation, and it has an actual story line.   Some people are complaining that the map is not big enough. Well think about it - Fitting thousnds of miles/kilometers of roads and hundreds of cities into a game is pretty damn hard. Not to mention that if they did so, you'll probably get a game that will weigh over 100 GB's, and probably won't run on most PC's. So they took the best of what there is, and put it in the game.   My only complain is that the game lacks some cars, for exmaple: Subaru Impreza WRX STI, or Toyota Supra. I expected to have those cars in a street racing game. I truely hope they add these cars sometime.  And another thing, and this is aimed towards people, not the game itself: You complain about unrealistic physics in an ARCADE RACING game?! Are you serious?! An Arcade Racing game is supposed to have unrealstic physics.   If you're looking for sims: Go for something like Assetto Corsa. Because this is not a Sim. This is an ARCADE RACING game.",

The driving still needs some work cars float too much but overall the game will be a nice change from every other online game currently available.  1/1/15 Update  After spending quite a few hours learning and fine tuning a number of cars I've dicovered that the handling isn't as bad as I had previously assumed. Before I hadn't done much adjusting of the settings but now that I have I can deifnitely confirm the handling is fine just the defaut handling gets you off to a bad start.  I now have a 1299 car of all but Raid spec which is much harder to grind the parts on. There are certian cars for certain races. Races in the Mountain range on snowy roads are better in a Ford Focus than a Ford Mustang.  The game has alot going for it but they really need to work on expanding the Map maybe DLC's that add more cities into the map would be a quality start.   They really need to work hard on more cars ASAP there are tons of cars that could be added to this game that would really give it a lot more life. Not everyone wants a Ferrari or Lamborghini and while the Koenigsegg Agera R is an awesome car it's just not realistic to use on a US map.  Car models I'd love to see added to the game would be more upper class but not super cars. Lexus, Audi, Cadillac and Acura. There are just a lot of cars left out that the game really needs.  I really enjoy the game and there is nothing that would make me quit playing it. Weekly missions in game need to happen more often and there should be some type of end game which right now the only end game is racing other players.",

            "review_text": "Jacko Rating  7/10 The Crew is the first MMO to do something different and use cars and driving instead of the usual aray of fantasy characters. It is an enjoyable mix of arcade/sim style racing with the added online benefits - namely being able to join and crew up with as many as 4 of your mates to race and cruise all over the USA. Strengths are definately the enjoyment you get out of messing about with your friends whilst in your hotted up car, the graphics are good for next gen but for the PC it could be better, 60 FPS on PC runs smooth enough, the sound effects from the cars are nice and beefy and last but not least the size of the map and drivable area is absolutely massive. The weaknesses are - its gets a bit laggy from time to time, there are not nearly enough visable players online making it not really feel like a MMO (at least not yet), not enough races on offer and the button mapping system is frustraiting when trying to really customize it. The final verdict after 42 hours of playing time is despite its flaws it is an addictive driving game especially when cruising around with mates but no substitute for a real racer (wait for Project Cars). This is well worth your money if you intend to play with friends online and like a massive map of the USA to drive around but if you want a hardcore racer to post times and compete against mates then this will only annoy you. Pretty Good Game but could have been much better.",

While the concept of the game sounds great, Ivory Tower fails to execute it well. The cars all feel similar (the performance cars all feel the same as each other, the raid cars feel the same, etc) and don't control as good compared to other driving games. The game borrows many ideas from previous Ubisoft releases that don't really translate that well in a car. The online community for this game may as well not be there. There is a chat in-game but in the 20+ hours I've put into this game I've yet to see one person use it.. which can make it hard for people to find a Crew to party with in-game. Invites to races and events other people usually go unaccepted. While a large portion of the Crew relies on having a Crew, the game doesn't have a whole lot to offer for people looking for a single player experience.   The map for this game is huge and allows you to drive from the east coast of the United States to the west coast. In between are rocky mountains, open plains, wildlife darting across the road, cops, pedestrian vehicles getting in the way, little towns at the end of dirt roads and huge cities. In between all these are hundreds and hundreds (it seems like) of events. There's a handful of events such as staying in between the lines, smashing through 'gates', going as fast as you can, mountain climbing, and more. Completing these events (and other races) reward you with a score based on how well you did and are rewarded with different car parts than you can equip to cars; increasing their overall stats. Instead of climbing towers to unlock portions of the map; making you work a little for your progress, the Crew has you drive up to the satellite dishes located by a blinking aura on your map and GPS.   The story is extremely dull, laughable and perdictable.You play as Alex, a man wrongly jailed for the death of his friend. You have the chance you redeem your freedom as FBI Agent Zoe sends you information on the man who killed your friend, and she believes the police officer, Coburn, who arrested you is working behind the scenes with Shiv. You must race your way to the top, earn your ink, and take down Shiv. The music is subpar, instantly forgettable and I found a hard time finding something I enjoyed listening to in-game.  If you're interested in the Crew to get your racing game fix I would suggest looking elsewhere. There's plenty of other racing games out there that are multiple times better that'd you actually enjoy. Also, uPlay sucks.",

As that may be my own fault for rushing it, I just recommend if you play to wait a LONG time before playing ranked.    -Street Challenges As this may just be my own personal opinion, I find as you're driving down the road, the excessive amount of Street Challenges are way too much. They typically cover the entire road, and frankly try to force you to do them. You literally have to swerve off the side of the road to avoid them... Personally, I just find them annoying as they hardly reward you anything and are quite dull, typically trying to force me off the path I was originally going.    -Wild Run As this isn't nessicarily a con to me, I find lots of people complaining since the season pass didnt include Wild Run. As I didn't pre-order or buy the Season Pass expecting it (Due to me buying the game far after the big fuss about it happened) I don't find this really a con since it's only $10 more. Though do be warned, season pass doesn't include ALL dlc like most games have it. It lacks a big item that the game basically requires and tries to force onto you, Wild Run.    -Basic Story Plot I won't spoil anything for you but, if you have ever played Need For Speed: Undercover.... This is basically that game. It has pratically the exact same plot and will give you extreme de ja vu.    -Bad Graphics... As this isn't such a big deal to me, the graphics for some things do make me laugh. The graphics for scratches are incredibly cheaply made... That's really all I have for that one... It's just rather funny how horrible they are.    Now Onto the Pros   -Long Story At the time of writing this, I am 10.3 Hours into the game, and still not even halfway into the game. It seems to be VERY long which I absolutely love, something most games nowadays seem to lack.   -Some Nice Cars There are some very nice, detailed cars in the game. Though expensive.   -Entertaining I've always been a big fan of Racing Games and I can say, this game I absolutely fell in love with. It's one game that I can actually sit down and play for a long while without getting bored, which is very few for me.    -Controls Okay, This is moreso to personal preference but - The Controls for this game is rather different compared to most games. If you're using a controller, it may seem a bit weird just to how the handling is, but I can say after a while you will get use to it. I personally fell in love with it.    I would probably rate this game 7/10... It could definitely be better, but It's still rather good. A nice relaxing game to come home to if you have nothing else to do",

            "review_text": "I have been playing The Crew for about 2 hours.  From a racing simulation point of view, the game lacks in various areas such as handling, physics, drivetrain, shifting. All vehicle handles nearly the same, with more or less understeer. Gearbox is odd, and slow while shifting/down shifting, handbraking is slow. On road, cars rarely spin out, but when pushing them to the limit, the cars will throw the rear end out, but refusing to turn. There are three modes of driving: All Assistance, Sport, Hardcore. All assistance would include ABS, Traction, steering stability, etc. Hardcore has less traction and less steering stability. Drifting is a pain in the ♥♥♥ on keyboard, but manageable on Sport and Hardcore mode.  Tuning is simplified and a lot easier for the general audience, nothing too complicated. Parts are found during runs and story events, Gold, Silver, Bronze, each adding x amount of additional car level. Level cap for players is at 50. Level caps for cars are at 1299.  From a car enthusiast point of view, for those who just wants to collect and drive the cars, and tune (not in-depth tuning), this game is great. Graphics are beautiful, damages to the vehicle is mildly realistic, environment is great. You wont be able to run over people though, just like that in Driver San Francisco, they would jump away with Level 9001 reflex skills. Engine sound effects on the cars come close to that of real cars, but only when not in cutscenes. Engine sounds from cutscenes souds like that of a muscle car, V6/V8. Collecters will still need to play the game and some events to make money, in order to mod the car. Game is Pay to Win or Play to Win.  The R34 GT-R is left hand drive, which does not exist, and makes the petrolhead in me heartbroken.  The Street Car upgrade in game gives a wheel (rim) which resembles 5Zigen Noir, which makes the Purist in me cry. Other recognizable brand of wheels (for those who care) includes: BBS (:D), HRE (:D), ROTA (D:), Volk Racing (:D) and of course, Original Equipment Manufacterer (OEM) wheels.  All Street Cars are stock height, which makes me Iacrophobic.  Game cannot be played with no internet connection, from what I've seen.  Best part about the game is that they have a replica Pike's Peak Uphill/Downhill sprint run in the Midwest. Very fun to do a tandem drifting run up/down with a friend.  Rate Game 6/10. It's not bad, but it's far from perfect. Definitely recommend for car lovers. Definitely a great game to go cruising around with friends and racing around town.",

When the wild run expansion came out, it costed like 30 bucks here and you were literally just paying for 3 new specs, a bike, a drift car, and a monster truck. Why the hell is this not free? The Crew wasn't even released that complete, and then they lock off half the cars just to milk money. The game itself is actually pretty fun, but the handling needs to be adjusted in the options, and the map wasn't the 'whole america.' The selection of cars is very little and it's stupidly small added with the wildrun dlc. This game has microtransactions everywhere, and although it is pretty easy to make money in this game, it's obvious Ubisoft is a money milking corporation. The graphics are beautiful, though.  TLDR Unless you have around 150 bucks, don't expect to get much content out of the game quickly Graphics are good, and the map isn't really the 'whole america,' though it's still pretty good.

            "review_text": "I followed this game for quite a while before it came out. I was super psyched for a racing game with car customization in an open world, something Need for Speed has not done for a while now. However, I will admit that once it came out, I never really heard anything about it. It seems like I basically forgot. Then, a friend of mine got it and I ended up buying it on sale. Clearly, as you can see from my hours, I really have enjoyed this game. However, it has some serious quirks to it, and they aren't necessarily good. So, here's what I enjoyed about The Crew, and not so much.   PROS:     The Open World  - I didn't realize just how big the map was until I really got into this game. It has, by far, the largest map out of any racing game I have played. I cannot compare it to FUEL simply because I have not played it, but it is bigger than every NFS game. And best of all? The map is  not  repetitive. You can drive from the swamps of the south to the deserts in the west, and have different scenery and small towns/cities in between. It mainly revolves around 5 major cities, and they are New York, Chicago, Miami, Las Vegas, and L.A. The developers certainly did their homework when it comes to the cities, and I applaud them for it. Even after 260 hours of gameplay, I still see places on the map I have not been, making the open world my favorite part of the game, by far.     PvP  - I find that the PvP is well done. You play in a lobby with up to 8 players at a time, who all choose exactly what event they want to do, and then the game randomly picks one of them. This includes events with any of the 5 specs. Some events are elimination, others regular races, and others a 'king of the hill' type game. What's even better is the amount of in-game money you get from PvP. Even if you get last place, you still get nearly just as much money as the person in first, and this can make it enjoyable for anyone that plays. PvP is the best way to make money, currently. However, it still does matter what place you get, since there  are  PvP ranks in the game. The higher you place, the faster you rank up.     The Graphics  - Towards the end of 2015, a free update brought in new, updated graphics along with a weather system, which also includes slick roads after rain. This is all much better than before. Unfortunately, my lower-end GPU cannot handle max graphics, however, that is not to say that the game still looks very nice on High. It now looks more like a game released this year. Also props for it being a completely free update!     Car Selection  - You can have (almost) anything, from a LaFerrari, to a Hummer H1 Alpha, to a Dodge Challenger. What I like is that the game has 5 different specs for most cars (some ranging from just 1 spec to all 5), which are Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit. Take, for example, the Challenger. It can have all 5 specs, so if you want to go on dirt roads with one, you hop into the dirt spec Challenger. If you want complete offroading, you go with raid. And if you want to take it to the track or go extremely fast on highways, you get the circuit spec, and so on. What's nice is that you only buy one Challenger, and as you progress through the game, you get it in each spec, so you technically have 5 Challengers.   NEUTRAL:     The Police  - I always enjoy it when there is law enforcement in an open-world racing game. At this point, I think it should be mandatory. The Crew, of course, has police, but they are only decent. Nothing more and nothing less. Unfortunately, this is where Need for Speed does something better than The Crew. During a police chase, even with 5 stars, there will never be any more than 5 police cars at once pursuing you, which by the way, are quite easy to take out. The roadblocks are laughable, since they never use anything other than the cars that are pursuing you to block the road, so you can usually speed right through them, unlike NFS: Most Wanted, which eventually has SWAT trucks that basically force you to take another route. There are also no spike strips. While it still can be fun to get into chases and have a friend taking out cops for you, I believe it could be made significantly harder at 5 stars with the use of bigger vehicles and spike strips.     Customization  - I'm very thankful that The Crew actually has customization to begin with, but it is really lacking. For one, you cannot choose from any color in the spectrum; you just pick from a preset list of colors. Second, the decals are mostly terrible. I tend to use the same 10-15 decals on most cars, or sometimes not at all, because most of the others are just bad looking and don't seem to fit any vehicle. Granted, that is personal preference, but for someone who has played NFS:Most Wanted and Underground 2, those are far superior in customizing.   CONS:     Uplay  - I think you saw this coming. I know I did. Uplay is a requirement for The Crew, even if you buy it directly from Steam. You  must  download Uplay, and you  must  create an account. Although it can run in the background for the most part, the matter of the fact is that it is extra DRM that no one really wants, especially someone like me that only has 1 Ubisoft game. It also contributes to a longer startup time.     The Story  - Full of clichés and it being overall boring, the story is pretty much mandatory in order to reach level 50. The movie-like cutscenes in it are neat, but if you are like me, you'll do the story just to get it out of the way. The fun seems to come after it's over with.     Smart Loot  - This system is possibly the worst addition to The Crew since launch. Granted, before it was added, people still complained about the grinding system for leveling up your vehicle. Now, however, it is much, much worse. Instead of what used to be a much quicker, platinum only part grind where you could go up as much as +50 spec points in a single jump, is now down to as little as +1 for the same skills. Not to mention you also have a chance of winning a customization part, such as paint, or a bumper. This makes it very hard to get your car to 1299 (the max spec level), if you weren't a player before Smart Loot was added.   Closing Thoughts  Despite some big flaws, I have enjoyed this game a lot, and I would say it's in my top 5 racing games now. The Crew, to me, earns an 8/10. If you can look past the cons listed above, I do recommend this game to any person that enjoys racing games, or is looking to try the genre in general.  ",

Is their a time when you wont have the internet and still be able to run this game because most laptops will not run this game and the data rates are low enough.  Extreme rubber banding AI  The AI can be pretty easily fixed because it was already fine in the beta so all they have to do is find a balance between the beta and the official game AI.  server issues   Well it is only day 2 now so you can expect to see improvements soon  MISSING VEHICLES AND SPECS THAT WERE IN THE BETA!  I don't even know?! How can you have more cars and specs for them and not put in your official launch game when they were in the BETA! THIS BETTER NOT BE A PLOY TO GET MORE DLC INTO THE GAME! I am hopeful that their were issues with them and they will be adding them in the game (FOR FREE) when the time comes.   Maybe handling issues!?!  I say this because I don't think players understand how these vehicles work.  Full stock= Slidey  Street= Not as slidey and faster Dirt = Slower made for trails/drifty Performance= Gripey 2ed fastest highway/street Raid= trucks that raid any where and are slowest Circuit= Grip mobile fastest highway/flat roads with some twists  You see alot of people only had access to level 10 in the beta witch is only the top 3 specs and they were saying it was like 'driving on ice' Each car handles different in the different spec and each spec has their own general handling so their is a lot of leeway in how the cars handle, not to mention the small upgrades for the vehicles in game that affect handling.   Having played lots of racing games (simulator/arcade) it is defntly more toward the arcade side but it does have a wide range of different types oF driving.     These are the most persistent and worst issues of the game but all of it can be fixed through patches and updates, only time will tell if they will attempt to fix these issues.   The good?  Map beautiful and huge with fast travel to anywhere you have been NEAR ! A good selection of vehicles just not a huge spectrum (needs companies like DMC, Tesla, Hennessy and a few others that are part of American history (THE GAME IS ABOUT AMERICA more American cars please!) )  All kinds of exploring 4 player/ multi-player  Free content updates Currently 48 vehicles with different specs for each (HOPEFUL MORE WITH UPDATES AND NOT DLC AS THEIR IS ALREADY TO MUCH DLC) This game works well with wheels (Has used the logitech driving force gt (was $120 new) for the whole playthrough but I recomend the logitech g27 if you can afford it $200) etc.    Those of you that this is more of a money issue i would just wait untill its on sale but if you like mixed racers want to explore with friends or new people and have the pc to run this game well, get it.    I enjoy the game for what it is worth and I hope that if you do buy it you enjoy it as well. $ 85 (game+dlc) is a lot for a title I just hope my purchase and hopes were not misplaced.   oh and uplay still sucks and it always will!

(with multiple race tracks to find might i add). The only possible downsides is that upgrading the cars can feeling like endless grinding to get the part you want, BUT it really isn't bad, also that the cop chases are pretty sub-par and lastly you need uplay.  Closing note about the negative reviews:  Most seem to be about the difficulty of the game and how some missions might need multiple people.  Honestly all I have to say about the difficulty is git gud :p I had no problem with the game at all (not to mention a little challenge is always fun!) and in terms of the missions that may need multiple people, there is an option before the mission inviting all people that you can see to help you, so finding multiple people is easy!

Game has a huge map, probably the biggest of any open world game so far, the car handling is amazing, physics are pretty much bang-on, the in-game community is great, the car customization could use some work but it's a very small kink in an otherwise well-oiled machine.   As a veteran racing-game enthusiast (weird guy that 100%s gran turismo games) it took me almost 20 hours to get through the story mode watching every cutscene, the story is even good although somewhat generic, it's well done.   If you're an open-world racing game fan this game will probably give you a weird feeling, traditionally we saw games where you could see it, but not necessarily go to it. With this that simply isn't the case, if you can see it in The Crew, you can almost always go there.   6 levels of customization put the game's huge map to use, they are fullstock, street, dirt, Perf (performance), raid (trophy trucks), and circuit (full-blown race cars) each with it's own merits and downfalls that add an unmatched level of diversity to the game.  The options menu is even pretty comprehensive with toggles for anti-aliasing, even types of anti-aliasing. individual performance impactors with their own toggles, and full wheel support with multiple ways of customizing so you can tune it to your driving style.

            "review_text": "First of all, Use Voice chat, vent, skype TS, whatever, just communicate with people.    Probably one of the best arcade racer I've ever experienced. that's something.  Let's get something straight. Arcade racers are racing games that have selective physics to allow fun things to happen. If you are like me, someone who clocked 1000+ hours into Gran Turismo, played every racing game from F-Zero,CTR,Top gear,F1 simulators, to Racing lagoon. you don't expect anything to ever blow your mind again. Heck, after NFS after NFS, I started to believe arcade racers have nothing to deliver.  This proved me wrong. Fantastically crafted balance of doing what's expected of a racing game, and taking itself seriously without being pretentious.   &gt; Physics  The physics are well crafted to do what it's supposed to, The hitboxes are somewhat forgiving as they will let you scrape past a crash or dodge trees from time to time, (unlike Forza where entering a corner wrong is kinda...fatal) It doesn't make you OCD about keeping your car in control like GT, and is both a relaxing and exciting experience.  &gt; Visuals  If you have a good PC, the visuals are quite decent, the topper is the cinematic value of an active racetrack. The game is light and easy enough for you to enjoy the cranes and planes, and steam leaks, strategically placed to block you from seeing stuff ahead is a nice touch.  &gt; Story  The storyline? I didn't care for it at first, but it started to get better, unexpectedly good for something so cliche and dead on hollywood scriptwriting theories, The characters have a lot of depth for a racing game. It demonstrates there's nothing wrong with cliches, if it's done right. The end feels fulfilling and I'd totally get DLC for some of the character side stories  The game is meant to be played together, the story is written so you can talk ♥♥♥♥ about it. It's not groundbreaking but it does the job right, something I haven't seen in racing games in a long time.  (Willing suspension of disbelief regarding 'driving fixes problems' is required. though much less than a michael bay movie)  &gt; Gameplay  It's broken the line of pathetic cops game after game, where you can just 'go vroom vroom really fast' and get away. It's a fantastic breath of fresh air. The cops actually do something. They will stop you if you drive stupidly behind them, you react to their radio as it gives you clues when they're going to ram you, and you'll have to take risks to get rid of them (not just 'don't crash'). You can see that they're programmed to make the chase fun, forcing you to react and think of ways to taking them out, (which is not no longer a fancy dressing on a cake, it's required.) If you like challenging cops, this is going to be fun. I'm still expecting the difficulty to increase as people learn that you cant just get away by driving in a straight line. you know, the same people who ask Is it realistic? no, you aren't probably ever going to get away from realistic cops.  If you are finding it too hard, you probably aren't voice chatting enough.  The Missions are actually fun and challenging, there is enough substance in the car handling to make different skill challenges enjoyable, and the reward of making your car a bit faster after every race is great. Those crash missions are great fun, you have to plan and execute crashes giving a nice buildup to a climatic crash.  I hate catchup bonuses, But I'm going to make this an exception, It's right for the type of game it is.  &gt;MMO  It's the best way to halt the piracy of the game, This was going to happen sooner or later, and this is a really good first step for racing games.  For an MMO, this is really well designed, I'm surprised at the MMO elements that they've got working nicely in the game, (like the RNG god) They're missing like, crafting, (Player designed parts? *wink wink*) but that's ok. but The game is well designed with so much to do for every type of gamer in the bartle test. I've found myself navigating a rocky offroad mountian climb with my friend, pushing him when he's stuck, and screaming when i was so close to getting over that rock before tumbling down. The open world is done right.  You're all worring about the cash aspect? I feel what they're doing now is perfect, Yes cash helps you get stuff, but to get the end game gear, you gotta get your hands dirty grinding the RNG god for platinum parts. so yeah, money will give you access to some cars, but any car can be tuned to the same performance tier, This is probably the correct pay model, It respects customers enough to not be pay to win, I hope activision keeps it that way.  The game is much more enjoyable with people to talk to, It's really how it's designed. The drawback is there's only half a dozen people in your session, so it's sort of an mmo with very small servers. But let's be honest, 1-- players infront of the HQ isn't driveable, especially with how much you guys care about traffic laws. )and the number will probably increase after launch day fad is over when the server is more free'  It's not free of glitches, but to be honest i'm surprised at how well it's working for a game a couple days from launch day? I'm starting to hate Activision a little less, just for publishing this.  &gt;Sound I mentioned to my team time after time how good the Dodge Viper sounds, what pisses me off is the music, But luckly i'm on a PC, so I can just play whatever I want in the background. The sound's what it needs to be.  Tips&gt; (Tl:dr version) - Any car can finish the game - get a crew and voice chat outside of game - accept that this isn't 'realistic' like F1, GT, and Forza - prepate a written a list of insults for the police - expect some disconnects and patches near launch date - Don't tune a 2nd car until you get 40, then buy the most expensive kit starter. - Best way to farm for money is PvP, don't grind jumps like I did. - Don't try to gold stuff unless you are stuck at a level, Platinum parts unlock at lv50. - Your mother is a nice person, okay? now stop crashing me out in PvP.",

I just really hope the MS doesn't kill it, turn it into P2W, and that the prices are REASONABLE!!! Now if they would just add a few more trucks and (before the tuner haters start ranting) that they add Scion. Look'em up, they are winning like mad! (and hey, the tC and FRS are good lookin! don't deny it you muscle car lovers =P ) But really though, go check out the vids on youtube!    So looking forward to the game expanding, so much potential with such a great idea! (aside from the normal dose of haxlet nubtart basement dwelling trolls, the ones on here don't seem to grasp the concept of 'crews' nor factions in this game.)  I did the closed beta and even at that time with bugs and adjustments needed in phsyics/mechanics it was a blast to play. The cars look great, although the car audio could use some attention to make them sound more like the real deals IMO. Have any questions, feel free to ask!  Also IMO, the gold will be worth it. Look forward to hating some tires on Dec. 2nd!  Well now after launch I still don't change my opinion! I have noticed a bit more lag than beta and had a crash. In beta I had less lag and no crashes lol. If you didn't get the pre-order you missed out on some cool content.   Any questions as I said before; Feel free to ask  Lag has lessend quite a bit and still waiting on the patches. They are starting to make a habbit of not really supporting the games after release. Still though I do reccomend the game, just wait for a sale. If they fixed the sync issues and a few other bugs that can hinder game play a bit, it would be well worth the full price.  Well after playing and waiting, it is about half of what they promised. Not suprised as Ubisoft is making a habbit and trend of this crap. With the issues of being able to see other players and 'co-op' still giving a problem, with NAT issues. It can be fun when you can actually play with others and find people that actually have a clue as to what The Crew is supposed to be. Still say it's not worth full price, but it is free to play monthly, So... If you are still on the fence, I suggest wathcing some streams or Youtube vids.",

You also only have 3 minutes to catch him even if you can still see him, so if you mess up you have to restart. and if you mess up in the begining you can't restart until after you get the prompt to pick your abilities (which you will have to pick again after you restart). Oh, and it stops you mid chase to pick out those useless abilities, then throws you back into a high speed chase with no warning when you exit. even after I beat that mission it just made me lose interest in the game.",

            "review_text": "Ahh... The Crew. I must say, this is probably the best racing game I have ever played. Yes, I do have experience with racing games, as I have played NFS:UG, NFS:HP, Forza 4, Forza Horizon 2, GT, and GT5. However, I have never had more fun on a racing game than I have had playing The Crew. The Crew features a HUGE open world MMO (and by huge, I mean that it's literally a condensed version of the United States). The map has 5 major regions: the Midwest, the East Coast, the South, the Mountain States, and the West Coast. Each region has it's own main city, except for the Midwest, which has two. The Midwest has Detroit and Chicago, the East Coast has NYC, the South has Miami, the Mountain States has Las Vegas, and the West Coast has Los Angelas. Each region has it's own smaller states too, such as Salt Lake City from the Mountain States, and Sacremento from the West Coast. The map is so big I probably haven't even explored 75% of it yet.  There is a pretty large selection of cars to choose from, from a Ford GT to a Nissan Skyline R34, and each have at least one out of five specs (the starter cars have all specs, and so do some other cars). The specs are: Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid (which is basically almost monster level), and Circuit. Street is the middle child when it comes to speed, but it handles great and can take corners easily. The best car for Street is probably the Nissan Skyline R34. Dirt is for slight off-roading, as it is very fast on dirt and road, but can still go offroad faster than Street, but not much faster. The best car for Dirt is porbably the Ford Focus RS. Performance is the second fastest, and is the one you'll probably race with the most during the story. It take corners well, but not as well as Street, but it's speed makes up for it. The best Perf car is probably the Koenigsegg Agera R, Ferrari LaFerrari, or Lamborghini Aventador. Raid is for straight-up offroad and taking people out. It's the slowest, but it doesn't need a road to get to one's destination. It is the fastest offroad. The best Raid car is probably either the Chevrolet Silverado or the Ford Raptor. Now for Circuit. Circuit destroys on roads, hands down, but when it comes to offroad, you're better off just fast-traveling to the nearest street. The best Circuit is probably the Ford GT or Saleen S7.  The story is great. I had a lot of fun playing it. Play as Alex Taylor, who was put in prison for being framed for the murder of his own beloved brother, Dayton, by a V2 from the 5-10s named Shiv, and a corrupt police officer named Coburn. Travel across the U.S.A. to climb to the top of the 5-10s to get revenge on Shiv.  All in all, this is a great game. I don't think I can stress how much I loved it.",

I highly recommend it.  First of all the game runs very smoothly on my gaming notebook (3 Years old now) of which I was very surprised, as its a great leap forward comparing to Test Drive Unlimited. The world is huge and the game is technicaly on a high level of detail.  First negative that stroke me and that other reviewers were writing about was the bad driving physics. The cars slide a lot that is true. I blamed the keyboard controls for that, then I have connected my G25 racing wheel and the default settings were way off. I really wanted to uninstall the game on the spot but I have made some research and found a good configuration for the wheel and I must say that the game imiedately became playable and enjoyable.  So if you have a wheel and are willing to play with the configuration you will get a nice experience, well I did. You should not expect the driving model of Project Cars, but there is so much to expolore in this game and I like many new ideas they have brought up.  It is a shame that because of bad defaults such a huge game leaves a bad taste. This game could benefit from more players become even more enjoyable. The quick way to team up with others is IMHO nicely implamented in the game.  Final verdict:  Give it a trial ! Just spend a moment configuring your controls.",

Respawned from the crash, car is still in the air  10/10 would Crash again  Edited Proper Review as of 11/12/2014.  Warning 'The Crew' is not a Simulation racing game, it is an ARCADE Racer.  if you are looking for a decently fun racing game to play. 'The Crew' is a considerable choice for this. There are few issues however with the game such as. The Cops and pursuers are OP, especially so in the earlier levels of the game. Later on as you become a higher level, they do become less OP, but are still OP but not to the same level as they were when you first begun the game. The cops aren't that hard if you know how to use the Specs of cars properly. There is a large number of people complaining about this issue, most likely a majority of these people, have no clue how to drive each of the specs of cars correctly. (Don't be one of these people, learn the specs correctly).  Warning, this isn't a Racing Simulator don't be like the Racing Elitest like those that are prowling the Forums.  'The Crew' does have some other teething issues, such as occasional lag during co-op missions, Lack of connectivity to other players and difficulty connecting to friend when attempting to join each others crew's (I'm from a country that the national average internet speed is 10 mbps, and the lag isn't even that horrendous for me) . These issues, are considered to be Teething issues, as the game hasn't even ben out for 2 full weeks yet, the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about all of these issues aren't taking this into consideration, and these people aren't taking in to consideration that almost no games at launch are 100% Glitch Free / 100% Bug Free / Balance correctly / have no lag and connection between players is working correctly.  This being said 'The Crew' is actually quite an enjoyable game to play, as summarised, there are a balancing issues, connectivity issues, etc   If you are thinking of purchasing this game, honestly if you don't mind not playing with some friends or dealing with occasional OP AI pursurer/cops, then you should definitely purchase this game.  If any of these issues do effect you eg occassional Lag, connectivity issues with friends or you get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the cops for some reason, as if you have a deep seeded issue with all forms of Law Enforcement. Then i would wait a bit for these issues to be fixed by ubisoft.  7/10 (would be 8.5 or 9, if the connectivity issues and balancing issues were corrected :D )",

I love open world racing games because sometimes I just wanna sit and DRIVE, not race against AI/online opponents. This game is as awesome as Burnout Paradise to do that (I still go back to that game from time to time).   I just hope they release a patch or something to keep playing it offline when they pull the plug on the servers...  Otherwise, a very very nice game.

            "review_text": "I honestly don't understand the rage here. There are problems sure, but you're not going to find anything close to this game for PC, period. I'd describe it as Euro Truck Simulator meets NFS Undercover (older version, not the remake junk).  THE BAD  The 'crewpoints' or whatever they are system. Yeah the publishers have hopped onto the in-game purchase bandwagon, and I don't agree with this nickle-and-dime system outside of free Appstore games, but it's not implemented in an annoying or necessary-to-play kind of way. I'm only 18 hrs into the game and have some junk car I started out with (sorry Ford), an upgraded mid-range car, and a beautiful Italian supercar I take out on special occasions. They even give you 100k credits after an early mission, more than enough to get you started. I haven't touched the credit system beyond that, but even if I wanted to, it would be a few bucks for a new car and some random customization. Considering I got the game for 30-35 bucks, a fiver added onto that one time isn't really a huge problem.  This always-online crap is the future, and it sucks. But I haven't had connectivity problems, so I can tolerate it. The community isn't huge, so PVP games aren't easy to come by in my 18 hour experience, but I enjoy playing the missions and just crusing around, exploring. And you'll always find someone running from the police or available to ram into (sorry, I do it with love). That said, impromptu street races and roadtrips would be pretty sweet, but maybe I just need more friends...  THE GOOD  The map! The open-world! Way too much to explore! While it's not totally accurate and all-encompassing, the ability to drive around major cities in most every region of the US (Alaska and Hawaii, sorry bros) is something I've dreamed of ever since I got into driving games. And it's implemented perfectly here. Plenty of roads to take across the US, varying in driving complexity and scenery, and I never feel as though I'm trapped or limited by a wall. The exception would be the actual wall seperating Mexico and Texas. Bush wasn't kidding.  The graphics are fantastic. A friend jokes that it doesn't take much for racing games to look good, and while true, the scenery is a joy to look at. They even have a 'photo mode' because they know we're snapping screenshots. Even on my paltry Macbook Pro settings, I really enjoy looking at the game.   The handling is perfect for an arcade racer, which is what this is. I play serious racing sims but can also suspend my pretentious ways to enjoy games like this and NFS. If only Just Cause 3 borrowed these phyiscs...  THE MEDIOCRE  Rubberbanding is annoying and while this game isn't horrible with it, if your car is underpowered for a race and you make one mistake, you're restarting. Even missions where you're supplied the car, no matter the lead you have, one or two mistakes in this case can cost the 5-minute race. I've got a mission in the latter that I cannot beat, even 18 hours into the game, and it's holding me back from new missions down that path.  There aren't enough missions. This is an 'MMORPG' (MMORG?). I don't mind grinding a bit to earn money/levels. But I worry I may eventually run out of ways to advance. There are events, and challenges while driving, but that may not be enough to sustain constant advancement. I'd even settle for 'collect the tires on the racetrack' type stuff.  I love cars and customization, but there just isn't enough here. While I was able to get the two main cars I shoot for every racing game, I'd love to see more older vehicles and some of the newer supercars (why no Veyron?). I mean, why is there an Escalade and a Hummer? This isn't Cruisin USA. Give me more Ferraris, a Countach, and Porches (come on, RUF??) The visual customization is pretty bare. There are quite a few colors and they allow you to customize all of the typical areas of the car, but the choices aren't enough, and aren't significant in differences. I've got to frequently switch back and forth between parts to spot the difference. But honestly, even if I were running around in a Ford Pinto, I'd have fun exploring the map.  TLDR  All said, this is a solid arcade racer, enough cars and customization to enjoy the experience (though I'd like more), beautiful scenery and graphics, but most of all: THE FANTASTIC, FREE-ROAM MAP OF EVERY REGION IN THE CONTINENTIAL US. If that sounds good, buy the game. As of current, make sure you get the Wild Ride or whatever version. It comes with the original game and the expansion. ",

Inbetween is a nice mix of everything; salt flats, snowy mountains, woodland. Tuning is basically unlimited. You can keep your first car and race it in every event, you don't have to purchase new cars to progress. The selection of cars is good, too. I like classic muscle cars and finished the game with only two cars, a '69 Charger for everything but the Raid class, and a Camaro for raid. All other cars where just gimmicks for free drive. The cockpit view is great, it feels real and you have a good field of view. The music is nice, too. A good selection of tracks for all genres. You can also create a custom radio station with the ingame songs, picking what you like from all other stations.  But not everything is good, you need to be online to play.

From cops and traffic to 'wow' style car upgrades, you can't get over the fact that this game's 'arcade' feel isn't arcade at all.  The game is bad. There's no way else to put it. I've played the game for hundreds of hours and given it chance after chance after chance. I love the car selection. I love the map size. I HATE the game! The game RUINS the experience completely.  The story is SO cheesy and bad. It's just bad, bad, bad. It's as if a passionate professional made half a car simulation game, then a buch of dumb teenagers took that idea and made it into a wow-like mmo loot system with the most ODD objectives NO ONE in a car would EVER do.  The traffic and cop AI is .. well, it's non existant is what it is. Take how bad it was in NFS Rivals times about 10,000 or so and you have how bad the AI is in this game. It's bad.  The game is bad. The game is bad. The game is bad.",

Lots of great and amazing looking and sounding cars. Very cool classes system like street, dirt, performance and rally, an awesome reproduction of the USA, lots of varied races and missions and a multiplayer that actually works. PvP races are great fun and motivate greatly to skill ones cars to the max. Free car updates keep bringing some of latest cars into the game. Like the 2015 Ford Mustang GT, one of my favorites!  For arcade racer fans and car lovers alike, this game is for you and I can fully recommend it! The 'Wild Run' expansion pack coming this winter should furthermore greatly improve this game.",

Because its a very heavy game on Medium - Ultra Graphics if you have a decent Computer you can run it... The game is great Good Gameplay Great Graphics Great Cars. Great Story Great Game. I highly Suggest this this will blow MDNC:LA ((If you're still on that 2007 -2009 gaming)) It will beat NFS: Rivals. NFSW: World. It may cost $59.99 But its worth it I highly suggest this! Please do buy I love it. I know not everyone likes UBISOFT but its a great game its Teen it has Strong Language but if it doesn't bother you then you're good.... Anyways This game is the Stuff.... I highly suggest this ((Yes I said that 2 times)) So Quick Review: If you like Cars, Good Grapihcs, Good Story line and Never EVER Driving alone. But it.",

Game can be completed with just your starter vehicle, there's hardly any incentive to buy a new vehicle unless it's something that catches your eyes (and you can afford it) or its practical and covers all 5 Upgrades.   You do not get a great sum of cash income at all. I've spent probably $4k (Crew Bucks) in total for cosmetic items like paint, bumpers and rims. By the time I finished the game I had 300K. Which can barely get you ♥♥♥♥ all.   The Crew can easily be completed around 14Hrs if you just tunnel vision your way through story mode - While upgrading your vehicle on the go. Getting to max level (50) took me around about 10hrs. The Crew's story it self was trash. It's not interesting it makes barely any sense and it's really not worth paying attention to at all. You'll often be questioning the choices made by writers who wrote the story.   The game does showcase key-parts to cities well, it isn't exactly to real size, however it does take in the important parts to places within USA.   Performance wise, it ran well on my PC on high and with 60FPS cap on (Note you can apply this within game setting - initial install its locked on 30FPS). Sometimes frames dipped within motion blur and unnecessary police red. blue light flashing on border of screen, but majority of the time i had a solid 60.   Honestly this game is decent at best, if you want a braindead game that can be slightly enjoyable and relaxing at times. But you will get bored easily.     Main reasons i pressed No to recommend game as it felt incredibly empty, boring and overall did not fill my expectations when I saw trailer for this ages back. You will 90% time be on your own and rarely EVER come across anyone online. IF you ARE keen on buying this though, do recommend buying on sale - not at full price.",

Pros: -Vast Open World to explore (Bigger than Test Drive Unlimited/Test Drive Unlimited 2's map) -Large amount of cars to buy and customize -The amount of customization is rather large -Each Spec you acquire for a car creates a new car with it's own customization. So 5 Specs would equal 5 different cars -Performance Parts for cars can be entirely earned without money by completing Skills in the Open World  Cons: -Micro Transactions -Payouts from missions and activities is low -Car physics get buggy when driving over certain features (ie Rocks/Cliffs) [This can also be fun and make funny moments. so maybe not so much a bad thing] -Campaign/Career is rather short. -You must be connected to the internet at all times when you play  These are just a few of the pros and cons. Again the pros outweigh the cons, and cruising with your friends makes it even better. I would recommend getting the game on sale or at least getting the Season Pass to save money on the DLC. This game is overall a great game. I would give it a 8.5 out of 10. It has a lot of replay value, making it worth purchasing.  Hope this review helps.",

As far as gameplay, I enjoy the large map, and the vast graphics. The physics; however, is something that I wouldn't give my highest rating to. (Although that's most car games I guess).  The Crew reminded me of Need for Speed before it became boring with it's closed circuit racing. It would be nice if in the future we can customize the appearance of the cars even more though! (Kinda like NFS Carbon). However, the perforance upgrades, and the variance with each part is superb! It is SO possible to have two of the same car running completely different. After all, that's realism! Nothing is ever 100% alike, and I feel like this game captures that.",

There's also abit of fun with the customization part with rims, colors, decals, bumpers - you name it.  The downside is the physics where its almost impossible to land on the roof for instance. Or you just fly sky high hitting a rock at 10 km/h.  Are you a racing-fan, then this is a game thats worth buying (wait for it to come on sale if you can), just for the sole purpose of the pvp-part.

Joining a crew for sertain missions and for PvP is realy easy, leaving said crew is aswell. The missions in PvE are easy, even Solo. The game has a short storyline by which at the end you are the Boss (V8) of a street racing gang that has gone international criminal orginasation. You achive so by means of driving missions using various vehicles like street cars, high preformance sport cars, dirt cars, trophy trucks and circuit speed demons. You can free ride unrestricted trough the USA freely switching between cars and explore a lot of sites, the game gives in game curency as a reward for visiting sight seeing area's and provides one or two lines of background info. Also you can get involved in police chases, and hamper other players that are being prosued.  The gameplay gives of a friendly arcade style feeling. The cars look real good and tons of costumization is available. The world you dive in is done quite good and I especially like how the road surface affects your grip. Rain and snow don't do your grip any good and the various type of vehicle will respond differently to it. Unfortunatly the road does need work, small bumbs and missalignments in road surfaces cause unecpected bumbs and jumps, or crashes if using a circuit car, and cause grip loss, sliding and other automotive mayhem. Something your computer controlled opponents don't seem to be bothered by. Doing the faction missions, which only help with cashflow or so it seems, the opponents are of about the same level as you are, making for an intresting challange, if not for the unfair behaviour of the game favouring against you. Which i found frustrating and annoying at times. The game as purely a racing game gets boring quite quickly after you have maxed out your personnal level and some cars you like to use. Doing the same 'test', a mini challange, can get you rewarded with the best possible parts for your ride. The lvl 50 parts have 4 different bonusses so again, costumize and find the best setting. Making sure that cars that have maxed out still have a bit of difference in them. All sounds good right? Yes, the game in istelf is quite good, be it short, and your reasons for playing it will mostly be becouse of your friends list. Gamers are friendly mostly but crews in PvP can realy ruin your day by having one or two members take out the competions and having their friends win easy. Well within the rules but not fair play.  The game has promise, and loads of DLC is indeed promised, including more cars and area's to explore. Most will have found the Mexican border crossing by now. But at the time of this writing, is not open yet.   Conclusion, If I make the game sound in general not bad at all, why not reccomend it? Well, there's this one thing in the way of hours of fun gameing with your friends. Crashes, not in game car crashes but gamecrashes, computer crashes, network crashes, server connection interruptions, explained errors, unexplained errors, known errors that will give you a code and ask you to submit them. (the location the game suggest is the Ubi website but i couldn't figure out where to put them in.) In 60 hours of gameplay I calculated an interruption would take place on average every 3 hours of gameplay. Fairly annoying and other than the occasional lagg not very accepteble in this day and age. I don't think my PC has ever crashed on any other game besides The Crew. Save for windows update butting in but no-one can blame any game or develloper for that right? I won't at least. So The Crew might seem as a must-have, but it isn't. So even if you still want to buy it, refrain from buying it together with the Seasons Pass untill you are satisfied with the game.

            "review_text": "First off I would like to say, I have more experince with this game then alot of reviews I have seen, I was a beta tester after all.   Here is what you get, a large, open, racing game that takes place in the USA. While not a perfect replica, most major reconizable areas are present, graphics are very good. The content can be realistically beaten in a couple of days if you just run and gun the story. However there is unlimited potential for VS, CoOp and Leaderboard *friend and worldwide*.   I will now address some of the falsehoods posted in a few reviews. Getting a crew, and doing CoOp is very much possible, however, I think it is reigon locked, as I seem to be unable to connect to European players and vice versa, for example. There are quite a few people playing, but depends on when you play, like any game, work, school, social events will flux the population. The game is NOT locked at 30 FPS. This USED to be true in the beta, but if you actually enter your settings for the game, you will see the option to 'frame limit' to 60. Now in my personal oppinion, 60 is bare minimum for an acceptable PC frame rate, I run a 120HZ monitor and that nothing new to the PC, so I do expect PC relases to hit 60+ without fail. Also, remember, when assessing a game, if you have bare minimum specs, your experince will be drastically different from a high spec machine, so do remember that when publically reviewing.  Now some Server stability, there have been issues here, mostly in the midday/late morning, they are not terrible, but for sure more frequant then deiserable, I suspect this will clear up soon. Uplay is almost useless for this game, now I am not a fan of it to start with, but it litterally tells you it is going to use steam to launch the application, if you launch from uplay. Good grief Ubi, just retire Uplay already.  Thats it for this review, anything else I have to say about it is purely my personal oppinion and has nothing of relivence for the game.",

I digress this game is fun, has LOTS to do, runs WAY better then most'a the games I just mentioned above, has LOTS of cool mods for your' car's looks/performance... a list of the cars people like the most, new content coming in the future, lagfree server (I never noticed any lag really), stuff to do with your' online buddies like Co-Op missions, races, prsuits etc. freeroam chat (that oddly nobody uses, nobody did in TDU games either SMH), always online so there's other players arounf to interact with (if you want to, you can play almost everything solo), challenging freeroam challenges... Did I say that almost everything gives you perforamce parts for bronze, silver, &amp; Gold?!? YES you have to use Uplay (they fixed it apparently cause it works now). Controls like a dream with an X360 for Windows pad, you can even remap the buttons (unlike SOME racing games)... The ONLY real complaint I have is the people who made this have the royal family confused... they made Dave look like fat Ken, &amp; made Alex look like Kenny... Um hello Alex is Blonde, &amp; would never grow a beard, nor need glasses...  **EDIT** after the last few patches, the game keeps running cruddier, they added MORE copious amounts of traffic to missions that already had WAY to much on a game that runs this badly... The game ran pretty nicely the 1st 7 months or so, but then Ubisoft started with B.S. updates that keep making everything worse... NOW the X360 for windows controller 'ALWAYS' pulls to one side (no it is NOT My 3 month old controller that works perfectly on 100, or so other games)... the game devs keep adding crap to the game to reward the attention trolls, arrogant beta testers, and hacktool users. If you have a VERY expensive gaming PC, &amp; wanna play a decent single player game, &amp; or like grinding boring ramp jumps for a whole entire weekend for each single car you own to get level 50 parts, them maybe you'd enjoy this game, but don't expect to ever have much fun in freeroam, or multiplayer.",

I decided to grab the gold edition of this game because I had some extra steam credit, and god it was worth it. The driving feels really nice, and there are a couple cool types of races. There are regular street races, off road races, and raid races where you try to destroy/damage the opponent's vehicle by ramming into them. The MMO aspects of the game are awesome, It's cool seeing 10 to 15 (you can only usually see around 10 people in one city, and driving around you'll come across different players) driving in the same area as you. The graphics are very nice, and the game runs pretty smoothly. (I play at Max Settings/1080p/50-60fps depending on location. Consoles apparently run it at the same but at locked 30fps.) The map is also massive. I drove from Michigan to Tennessee to Georgia to Florida, seeing cities like Detroit, Nashville, Atlanta, Miami, and other various small towns you can encounter in the countryside. You can literally go across the entire US. (It took me 10 minutes to go from Detroit to Nashville, so I'm assuming it'd be about an hour or so to drive from east coast to west coat and vice versa.) The Crew aspect which makes the game unique is also very fun. You can team up with random players or your friends and race or do missions. Overall, It's extremely fun, and It really suprised me since I'm not a big racing/driving game fan.  TL;DR buy this game, you won't be dissapointed.",

Too much cut-scenes when in trasition between locations, and an internet connection is required to play.(No Offline play)  Based on all of this, i give 8 out of 10!

            "review_text": "I like open world games for the freedom and a chance to do whatever whenever. I’m not into online racing and while I do complete a lot of the single player content it’s only as means to an end. Namely opening new cars and locations. The Crew is an open world sandbox with whole North America as the playground. On paper that sounds like the best thing ever.  One big problem I have with the complete edition is the DLC. As a bonus you get for free some of the fastest cars in the game and they are unlocked from the beginning. You can’t take these to beginner races and dominate everything but it does kill the need to progress. It takes hours upon hours of gameplay to earn enough to buy some of the fastest cars but since I already had a Ferrari and couple of McLarens there really was no need. It’s nice to get a Lamborghini but it’s not that different.   Even with the DLC the biggest complaint I have though is the car list. There just isn’t anything fun here! Most of it is just new supercars or American muscle cars and even those are new models from recent years.   Do you want to drive a red convertible into Las Vegas as in Fear and Loathing? Sorry the game doesn’t have convertibles. Do you want to be James Bond in one of his iconic cars? None of those are in the game. Fast and Furious it up with Mitsubishi Eclipse? Isn’t in the game. Maybe a hippie road trip in an old VW bus to San Francisco? Nope, can’t do that. Tofu delivery in the mountains with AE86? No. Herbie? No.  The open world in the Crew is absolutely humongous and it basically has no loading times. You can fast travel to any point on the map and it takes about a second. It’s insane how fast everything is loaded. The map isn’t to scale (obviously) but comparing cities like New York into the versions seen in other open world games and the cities in the Crew are much bigger. Plus there is almost an endless amount of wilderness to explore. There is no other game that comes even close. When you do jump somewhere though, the roads are empty for a while before any traffic starts to show up. Even in its fullest the streets are quite empty. You can’t get stuck in traffic at New York because there never is enough vehicles. While the scenery changes a lot and cities look different everything feels a bit devoid of life. It feels like the map was created by algorithm, not hand crafted by actual humans. There aren’t any funny little details or anything like that. While understandable in a game this big it does take something away from exploration.  Handling is arcade but I think it’s a good kind of arcade. Stock and street cars have nice feel to them. There are different variants and their behaviour is almost cartoonish. A performance car sticks to road like on rails while drift car just slides everywhere. Sense of speed isn’t very good at speeds under 100kph but going more than 200kph is really exiting. Collisions have some visual damage but it doesn’t have effect on handling and is repaired automatically after some time. Also respawning back to track is so fast that the dust from previous try hasn’t settled before you are back. It’s a really forgiving system.  Personally I didn’t feel like there was annoying amounts of rubber banding AI. For example: The cars have levels depending on their handling, speed etc. All races have minimum level and at that level you can win with good driving. If you join an AI car level 70 race with a car that is level 140 the AI will still give a suspiciously good challenge. If you join with a car that is at level 250 though you will absolutely destroy them. So the AI doesn’t scale up indefinitely. Cops and other chase related activities is a whole another story with spawning roadblocks and such usual open world stuff.   For someone who plays single player content the Crew is and open world playground without the “play” or an amusement park without “amusement”. The parks are and ground are on a technical level really worth seeing but the game lacks any soul. It’s sterile. The game runs fine and looks really good at times (The screenshots on the Steam page are bullshots). I had some issues with registering the keys to Uplay but few restarts did the trick. Without registering the game acts as trial which seems to have caused a lot of confusion but is not really an issue.   I Recommend the free trial version. It is basically full version with a time limit so do test before you buy! Many of the things i found irritating are subjective and maybe someone else who is in for the multiplayer side of things can get a vastly different experience. One thing to note is that your trial profile is the same as in full game so choose carefully which car you buy! You can’t start over.",

I digress this game is fun, has LOTS to do, runs WAY better then most'a the games I just mentioned above, has LOTS of cool mods for your' car's looks/performance... a list of the cars people like the most, new content coming in the future, lagfree server (I never noticed any lag really), stuff to do with your' online buddies like Co-Op missions, races, prsuits etc. freeroam chat (that oddly nobody uses, nobody did in TDU games either SMH), always online so there's other players arounf to interact with (if you want to, you can play almost everything solo), challenging freeroam challenges... Did I say that almost everything gives you perforamce parts for bronze, silver, &amp; Gold?!? YES you have to use Uplay (they fixed it apparently cause it works now). Controls like a dream with an X360 for Windows pad, you can even remap the buttons (unlike SOME racing games)... The ONLY real complaint I have is the people who made this have the royal family confused... they made Dave look like fat Ken, &amp; made Alex look like Kenny... Um hello Alex is Blonde, &amp; would never grow a beard, nor need glasses...  **EDIT** after the last few patches, the game keeps running cruddier, they added MORE copious amounts of traffic to missions that already had WAY to much on a game that runs this badly... The game ran pretty nicely the 1st 7 months or so, but then Ubisoft started with B.S. updates that keep making everything worse... NOW the X360 for windows controller 'ALWAYS' pulls to one side (no it is NOT My 3 month old controller that works perfectly on 100, or so other games)... the game devs keep adding crap to the game to reward the attention trolls, arrogant beta testers, and hacktool users. If you have a VERY expensive gaming PC, &amp; wanna play a decent single player game, &amp; or like grinding boring ramp jumps for a whole entire weekend for each single car you own to get level 50 parts, them maybe you'd enjoy this game, but don't expect to ever have much fun in freeroam, or multiplayer.",

Some of the reviews had me worried about buying it, but the worry is all hype. Some people don't have the slightest clue what it takes to develop a game. Just because you learned a few Java functions doesn't make you a developer. Games don't just appear from magic.   Now to the review. This game is an arcade style of racing. If you are a fan of Need for Speed, Midnight Club, Burnout, etc. (I know some of you can barely remember those titles), you will love this game. If you want a simulator style racing game, go play Forza. The servers are a bit haywire right now, but that's normal for an AAA title (BF4 anyone?). The waypoint GPS is one of the best I've ever seen, although sometimes the GPS takes you off road to get to hardball, but I figure it's trying to get you there as fast as possible. The rearview mirror isn’t functional (NASCAR 98 anyone?). I don't know why they didn't implement that. Maybe it will come in the future. The Gold Edition is definitely worth every penny. You get some cool cars off the bat and more to come with the season pass. If you are too cheap to buy the season pass, you still have some good cars to choose from. The guys complaining about having to buy the season pass to get free cars, refer to the 'games don't appear from magic' statement. I don't get why you think everything should be free in life. Maybe your liberal parents should've taught you better.   You crash a lot if you are going 200 MPH. But you are soon back on your feet, or tires I guess. The damage to your car in free roam goes away after some drive time. The servers stutter some, but not bad at all. It seems to happen more when I go to LA or LV, but these are two of the biggest cities in the game. Overall this game is worth it. The graphics aren't the best, the mechanics are arcade style, and the driving is fun. That's all you need. Plus it's a MMO! It’s styled just like AC games. So if you know how to navigate that map, you are good to go. Hopefully this curbed some of the worries you might have from reading the nit picking, 'I want my cake and I want to eat it too', reviews. It's a fine game... I can't praise it any more than I already have. ",

I may not like many things about the game, but the big issues, like no rear view mirrors in cockpit view, can easily patched out. I hope to see enough support for this game to see expansions like Canada, Mexico, and Europe as additional places you can go (maybe with a 10 level increase for each one released like WoW.)   Overall: 66/130  Please remember while reading this is only my opinion and I actually do recommend purchasing the game and playing.  Please don't let the low score throw you off. The driving and customization scores can easily go way up by patching Mirrors, damage, more cars and ways to customize them.   I'll start off with what it seems they wanted in this game.  ______________________ Miscillaneous: 35/40  Originality: 9/10 The spec system was interesting, Raid specs were something not really done in a racing game, and involving a purpose for them that was well designed as well.   MMO: 9/10 It's really actually good. I think it could have been pushed to that 10/10 if it forced you to group with other players for Faction missions instead of being able to solo them. I think they were afraid of not enough people queueing for 2 1/2 hour races though.  Story: 8/10 I read a review early into playing the game that trashed the story, calling it a 'typical racing game story'. After playing through it I see where this talk would be coming from, but it's really hard not to think they just skipped all of the cinematics because it was actually decent. Towards the end it got a bit old, everybody had these bad blood ties to the last boss with rediculous stories to go along, but the initial event, although obvious, was very well done. The end was also pretty thrilling as you confronted the final boss demanding a race for the V8.   Zone emersion: 9/10 Each zone really felt like it's own thing. Detroit and Chicago felt like street racing. All the dirt areas really felt like you were driving in a Rally car. When you unlocked perf spec you really feel like you did a bunch of street mods to your car. The mountain states were pretty incredible, and Raid spec for the missions there, you really felt like it was something you were doing. Circuit specs do feel like circuit speed compared to the others and there are lots of actual tracks in the game to go try it out on.   So that stuff was fine and dandy. The thing is, none of it is what the majority of people actually play racing games for. A lot of people are either Arcade drivers or Simulation drivers. This game has a middle ground, but anything other than Simulation is still Arcade, and for that most Simulation drivers probably won't like it.  __________________ Driving: 17/50  Handling: 3/10 This is because it is too easy to turn, this game has an Arcade feel where late breaking is very forgiven, and proper breaking is punished with early turning.   Speed: 4/10 It all feels very fast, but not real fast. Either the cars are tiny or the roads and buildings are crazy large, the scaling of going 65-75 mph is not even close to as fast as it is in real life, and inherently the higher speeds arn't either. I beleive it was scaled down to make the map seem larger, things take longer.   Mechanics: 2/10 Unlimited NOS (aside from the cooldown of refilling) brings this way down. Manual works well in Free Roam. The clutch doesn't seem to do anything when you have an xbox controller, can't say for a steering wheel as I don't have one. There is absolutely no gear grinding when shifting without using the clutch.   Camera View: 6/10 All the standard views, but the important one when it comes to this category is the Cockpit because it has the most detail. No working mirrors.  Damage: 2/10 Your car has a healthbar and you need to repair it, but the car will look fresh from the dealer even if it is damaged if you just drive it a bit. Damage does not effect any driving mechanics.   So the driving wasn't quite there. I don't play racing games to drive anyway. I personally love customizing, and driving slow in cool cars. I assumed a massive map where other players around the world could see my cars while a went for a slow cruise on the highway would be amazing.   _______________________ Customization: 7/30  Performance: 7/10 You get to change out a lot of the stuff under the hood. It's just a little far from realistic (being that its just Bronze - Plat LVLX peice)  Visual: 0/10 Far from the standard. When painting the car you can choose 2 tone but can't choose what part. You can't position vinals and can't have more than one. You can't customize actual peices very well, I have yet to find a car that actually lets you swap out the fenders, and most of the cars only have a couple of choices for each peice, if any.   Cars: 0/10 There are like none. There is not one Mazda or Subaru in the whole game. I hope there are many more cars added as in game purchaseables. NOT DLC UBISOFT.   _______________ Races: 7/10  PVP matchmaking and 3 hour runs for hardcores. Awesome. Starting a lot of the Story races already moving, annoying. When driving manual some of these races you have to be spamming the upshift as it starts because you start the race in 2nd at the red line.",

FIX THE ♥♥♥♥ING SOUNDS I extremely dislike it when my lambo sounds exactly like my skyline minus the very quiet, almost inaudible turbo spool and blow off. All the fords sound the same etc. Racing against AI is meh, if you know how to drive its easy.

This is especially true when the game in question is a game that revolves around driving. The controls are incredibly difficult to tune and even more infuriating to attempt to execute in-game. The game has several settings which the player can change at any given point in time while playing. These settings do about as much to help the player regain control of their vehicle as a map would do to help Helen Keller navigate Detroit. From what I can tell after well over an hour of simply tearing about experimenting with the different settings and looking of their 'descriptions' on various forums I reached a simple conclusion. This conclusion is that you can adjust your settings so that it feels as though you are flinging a brick across either a frozen pond or a recently thawed puddle of mud. From what I can tell the settings allow you to either get your car to steer straight at high speeds or be able to make it around corners at high speeds, but never both. I would not recommend this game to anyone, even a person that has sixty dollars of blood money they stole from the Mafia and were attempting to get rid of it somehow.

            "review_text": "I have not played this game for very long yet, but I wanted to type in a quick review anyway because the game is on sale now. Simply put, I'm loving this game so far. It feels to me a lot like the original 2005 NFS Most Wanted and considering that was my favorite racing game ever, that's a very good thing if you ask me. It's not quite as heavy on the police chases as that game, for one, police doesn't seem to care much how fast you go, just if you crash into things. And for another, so far I've been able to pull to my top speed and they can't keep up. I've seen others complain that regular patrol cars could keep up with their supercars, but my Mustang had no issues... Maybe it gets harder later in the game, maybe those that complain simply can't drive, I don't know yet but so far I see no problem.  The game is also very big, with different types of country and lots of recognisable landmarks. I spent 2 to 3 hours driving from Detroit to Seattle, LA, then Miami (so about 3/4 around the USA). In Most wanted I used to run a race that went around the entire game area that took I believe 20 or 30 minutes.  Another thing that I think is absolutely awesome is the support for my G27 steering wheel. The game recognises the wheel on its own and all the buttons it tells you to press make sense (although it took me a little while to realise that it used the shape of the buttons to indicate which ones it meant). The force feedback is decent, but gets a lot better with some tweaking (google for the xml file you can make). The game also fully supports the clutch and H shifter. I left it on autoclutch myself because I found that when I use the clutch myself I tend to get too wild at times and my wheelstand pro will not stay in its place (has nothing to do with the game), but I really love using the H shifter.   All in all, to anyone who's looking for a fun arcade racer that still has enough sim-like qualities to enjoy it with a wheel (unlike all recent NFS games), especially if like me you keep hoping that EA will steer the NFS series back to how it played in the NFSU2/MW/C era, I can definitely recommend giving this game a try. And you can download the demo first if you want, it's completely identical to the game, it just limits you to trying it for two hours, so you can safely test it out :)  update july 2016: Just felt I should update this... The game was really fun at first, but then, it just... fizzled out? It was cool to drive around the USA, but when I actually started doing more races, it just felt boring. I tried getting back into it and I'm just not even sure what to do. There is also NO way to restart your playthrough and Ubi defends this by saying you can replay all events... Yeah, NO! That doesn't help at all when you haven't played the game in a year and want to give it another go. It just drops you right into the middle of things having no clue anymore about what's going on. And with the individual races being so bland, well, I'm permanently abandoning this game and changing my recommendation.",

After fiddling with FFB and The Crew's own settings, I've actually managed to get the steering up to a level that is much more realistic, give a closer feel to actually driving. This will also make you a worse driver, competitively speaking, but that's just the nature of the beast. I'll take it, and switch controllers if I need to compete for something. Sometimes FFB turns off randomly. This seems to be a handshake problem between The Crew and the Logitech Profiler software. But it works sometimes and that's not nothing.   Still, the story, is a roadblock to your progress in the game. The rubber banding the cops have on you, the ♥♥♥♥ physics (they can stop you by tapping your car), makes your success at a mission totally random. You have to luck out, and I didn't sign up for a game of russian roulette with ai. There's no tactics to the game and you feel cheated because the cops and other cars always spec up to whatever your car is. Dumb story, poor mechanics. Not recommended.  INITIAL REVIEW So here's my problem with The Crew -- I've been spoiled by Assetto Corsa. The sound, the force feedback, the realistic physics, and responsive handling of AC are phenomenal. The Crew? Falls flat in all of the above categories. The FFB is poorly integrated (no preset profiles for even the most popular wheels, such as the G27). I've fiddled around with the logitech profiler for my wheel and have successfully sobered up from Animal House wasted to Weekend at Bernies buzzed.   Visually, it's underwhelming with terrible aliasing even with TXAA at 4X. I know, it's an MMO, the servers can't handle XYZ. But damn, the cars look clunky. Where on a real car you'd see rounding in a hard edge, you just get one hard line. In short, the gist of the car is captured, but it still feels like it's a model that was made in 2008.  The cars sound like lawnmowers. There is no frequency range in the sounds -- no low frequency humming or higher frequency whining as the engine red-lines. Just a lawnmower, or perhaps a Vitamix powering up. Makes me sad.   The story, (why oh why?!) is something that should be skippable entirely. The most protracted tutorial I've been through, with most of the game kept under lock and key until you complete the story. /Spoiler/ Your brother is killed, you're framed, you're recruited by FBI. Revenge /End Spoiler/ Flat characters, not even an attempt at an original storyline. Which I'd be okay with but for the fact that my handler keeps calling me up all the time, telling me to go to the next mission. Can we just skip the story. Please?!  The HUD is somewhat cartoonish, but I understand where they're coming from. It's NFS meets...well it's NFS. But if I so much as drive half a mile, I get a pop up congratulating me at every checkpoint and asking if I'd like to re-do the past 30 seconds of gameplay. No I do not want time travel as a feature--so please stop breaking my immersion and taking up 1/2 the screen with popups. I'm drivin here!  And of course, when you buy anything from Ubisoft through steam, you have to use their absolute piece of ♥♥♥♥ bloatware Uplay. Almost makes buying any ubisoft game altogether unappealing. This is part of why Ubisoft is becoming more hated than EA. Origin is annoying, but at least it has become bearable to use. Uplay is like a horrible amalgamation of the Wii avatar system (why can't I upload my own profile picture?) and some bizzarro world version of steam, where everything is bright, white, and useless.  In short. If you're looking for a driving sim *SIM* placed in a huge open world environment, don't even consider this game. It's not what it was marketed as, and it's not what it is. It's an arcade game. Open world. Expansive. Lack-luster graphics and a bloated, disruptive interface. If you liked the Need For Speed series, by all means, go right ahead. It's NFS with total MMO integration, and it does that very well. What it comes down to is that this game isn't right for me -- a graphics stickler who likes racing that's more sim than arcade. If you don't identify similarly, disregard much of this review. The Crew might be a fun rehashing of Need For Speed. But it's also a souless exercise in making a game as middle of the road as possible.",

            "review_text": "While this game was very much antisipated by myself and my friends alike we were all severely disapointed. This game is rated as a 'simulator' and while you can run a triple monitor surround with a stearing wheel (mine is the G27) with flawless rotation and actuation time from the game to the wheel there were several, and I mean several issues that I had hoped Ubisoft could have fixed because its not very difficult to fix but they are again just being lazy.   First off it doesn't seem to matter however you tilt my wheel to barely make a turn while letting off the gas the game refuses to understand basic physics, if I tap a car that I am passing you have a chance to get randomly thrown about 50ft and turned around or flipped in a wreck setting you back about 6seconds if you get the wreck cut screen, or depending on how bad it throws you 3-10 seconds.   Second, if you are driving a Raid vehicle (one designed for extensive offroad use) you can tap a small rock and while in real life even a four wheeler could easily go over this rock without any problems your high performance off road beast gets thrown around like a piece of paper in a air cannon.   Third, the game itself isn't consistant with what it tells you that your getting upgrades on. On my Zr1 Corvette set up for circuit I can be running 220+ miles per hour and turn my wheel and start drifting into a wall which then flings me 50ft (as stated before). I go out and find a mini game get a tire upgrade and kept playing until I got a tire upgrade with a grip upgrade in a gold metal (so I should have better grip with better tires now right?) Wrong. So very wrong. While I had the chance to go to Daytona Beach and drive a NASCAR through their training course you can pay for a day of training and drive with a co-driver, I was driving at 150mph. While driving my Corvette (after my tire upgrade) I hit the circuit and couldn't seem to keep a measely 200 mph when before I was easily holding 200 consitantly.   Fourth, this is a very minor gripe but a gripe none the less, while playing this game Ubisoft has put 'Gold Metal Cars' in during the mini game challenges while driving along the road. While I can be in front of this so called 'Gold Metal Car' and have a perfect score when time runs out I will complete it with a silver metal. What the f**k?   Though there is a few good points in the game, most of the stats for the cars (stock anyway) are pretty close to accurate in real life, and while the game doesn't give you a good perspective of how fast you are driving the acceleration is almost on point with most of the real life cars as well. Given that some cars are way off on their acceleration... (for a game that says its a simulation...)   This game could have been perfect... but then agian so could most of Ubisofts games that they refuse to do because every game that comes out has to be 'cenimamatic' and 60fps 'you cant see with your eyes anyway' yet you talk to anyone who messes with computers enough and they can tell you that they cant go any lower than 30fps even on just looking at the internet. I myself cant hardly watch movies in 30fps because it bugs my eyes. So everyone do yourself a favor and don't buy this. Get yourself a Xbox immulator download (yes you can get those) and buy forza horizon if our looking for a racing game.",

But it's actually the entire United States that you get to drive around in. Visit different landmarks throughout the country while evading cops and flying down Highway 1 at 200mph.   It's very well optimized in my opinion, ran the game on High Settings with a smooth 60fps almost all the time, never dropped bellow 53. The graphics are not mind blowing but they're pretty decent. And the transition from Third, to 1st, to Cockpit view is smooth as a freshly powdered baby's ♥♥♥ after a diaper change.  Another thing I should add is that you can take any car in this game, and compete with it against other cars. i.e. You can drive a 2012 for focus, and hold your own against a Lambo.   Only Con is it's multiplayer only. You can do races in single player instances, but you need to be connected at all times. It's pretty much a minimalistic Racing MMORPG.   Final verdict 8.5/10",

You can't drift worth **** with any car type, and the camera is just awful. It seems like they tried to make the camera look in the direct it thinks you want to drive toward, but always over shoots. So when ever you turn your always looking past where your wanting to turn towards. Especially when your moving more slowly, which makes getting out of a pile-up absolutly horrible.  I would honestly have GTA 4 Car physics over this. Also, tuning your car is nothing like you would expect. Its extreamly linear, with a menu that makes it look Open-ended.

            "review_text": "This is based on the Beta as of August 25th:  I realize this is a beta and there may or may not be changes made to the things that I list, and if they have been changed after this review I will change it. That being said I'll begin my review.  First impressions of this beta leave a lot to be desired. There are a couple things that I feel that ruin the immersion of the game and give it an unrealistic feel. The biggest example of this would be the car physics and handling. I understand that they are going for a more arcadey feel to the handling, and I went into the beta with full understanding of this. However, I feel that the handling could be improved. As it stands right now, the cars feel very 'floaty'. It feels as if the cars just slide around on the road, making them more difficult to drive than expected. This could be due to the strange sense of speed, which I will explain later on. There also seems to be a slight control input delay which could be a factor into this floaty feeling. It's not much of a delay, but just enough to feel it. I don't know if it's intentional to simulate the car having some weight but I feel as of right now that it is a little too much. Bear in mind I am playing with an Xbox 360 controller, and have not tried The Crew with a wheel or keyboard.   The second thing that I noticed is the sense of speed. You do not feel like you are going as fast as you really are, which can lead to you misjudging corners and braking. As mentioned before, this probably attributes to the floaty feeling of the cars, since at higher speeds I would expect the cars to drift around. Some minor tweaks like adding more motion blur to the edge of the screen would help, even narrowing the field of view as you increased speed to simulate tunnel vision.  So far that is my biggest concern with the game apart from obvious glitches and crashes which is to be expected in a beta. I am enjoying it quite a bit in the free ride and I feel once my friends get into the beta it'll be even more fun to drive around. It seems like it has a lot of potential to be a great casual racing game, but for me the actual racing isn't as fun due to, in my opinion, the strange handling of the cars. Offroad is a tun of fun especially in Raid Spec vehicles. and doing cross country trips is a blast.  As far as graphics go, it's a great looking game, but it's not the best, which is fine by me. The damage modeling seems a bit over exaggerated, you hit a fence pole and suddenly you have a dent in the front bumper that would crush your engine block. The game is fairly well detailed especially in the customization. You can strip your car down and see the internals of your engine and gearbox, which while it isn't necessary, it is nice to see them putting in extra detail.  There is a ton of customization options as far as body kits and rims. I love the fact that they added offical rims to the cars, instead of generic rims (which can still be used if you'd like). There are tons of bumpers, side skirts, hoods, and spoilers to choose from, although some of the bumpers do seem so much alike I couldn't tell a difference.  Overall if I had to I suppose I would recommend the game, but not by much. The potential is there, but it does seem to be lacking in some areas and even though it's a beta there's no guarantee that these things will improve. If you haven't preordered it yet, just wait and see how the reviews are after release. To me it's not preorder worthy, and I may ask for a refund by the end of this beta and wait and see.",

Horrible main stream music with no variety. It is NOT a simulator as it is tagged. it is NOT a MMO.(about 10 people per session does not make it an MMO) The little multiplayer they have is badly done. The story, while decent, is a massive heap of plot holes, just forget about them it makes it better. Roads are made of what seems like ice. the speed indicated seems like its way faster than the speed you seem to be going. Wants to show me random pointless cutscenes every 30 seconds. Cities are not ever close to accuratly represented to scale or appearance. Free roam would be nice, except its useless. you are forced to enter the map to start missions anyway.

Pros: - gigantic map, different landscapes, a pleasure to visit and cruise - quite great lifespan, there's no real 'end' even if you can quite quickly complete main story - nice personal XP and car level to improve performance and tuning - little but great panel of cars (american, european, asian) - quite good panel of races (even if some types of races are quite similar) - music choice  Cons: - 100% online - Playing alone or w/ friends is just the same since the missions aren't designed differently alone or with 3 friends - While in a crew, nearly 50% of the time you will not be rewarded for finishing some races because you got randomly 'disconnected' from the server - nice after an hour of driving - Sometimes you will see your friend offline ingame and you won't be able to play w/ them, even during some races. You have to quit and relaunch the game - Statistics and awards reseting randomly each two days - means you get less money per day - FF/FR/4WD : no feeling difference between them, they all act like some old FR - Engine sounds could be way better - Awful physics engine (bad management of crashes, collision bugs) - Sometimes cars are just randomly breaking, nice during a 1 hour race to lose just because it looks like your controller is stuck on the brake button - Good driving non rewarded b/c of the IA getting some kind of unlimited nitro so you can't escape them and get more than +0:02 - Bad driving non punished b/c of the IA waiting for you during a race if you're behind - Police cars : 80s Ford able to chase in straight line w/o difficulty a 900 BHP BMW M5 cruising @ 250+mph - Some DLC are unavailable - Ubisoft/Ivory Tower fixes that doesn't fix anything   This could have been a really great game if the IA wasn't so stupid and killing all the fun in the game w/ the bugs you encounter while playing in group.

Also just exploring around the areas for different landmarks that make up the vast map of the USA.

The missions sometimes take up to 10 tries to complete sometimes 15 or 20 times on the harder ones but you will eventually get there after repeating it over and over that you will progress to 50.  50 is where the long long long races start. PVP would also be good on these long 'faction missions' and you are just rewarded for completing the race in most cases. I just finished a 1h 30min race around the circumferance of the USA on all the highways and had enough funds then after I had been saving to buy a lamborghini. Now i need to go around earning parts for it. Each faction mission you complete earns you reputation and you progress through this at end game.  I feel the crew is a good to great game that will keep you buisy for a long time and it doesnt reallly get that boring if you pace yourself through the content, Microtransactions dont matter as you can get everything by just playing the game, but if you want to spend some real dollars on perks and buing a car well then why not hey. but its not pay to win and you can EASY get the cars with a bit of effort  Graphics are AMAZING at 4k and it runs at a good framerate, I turned the music off but the car SFX are awsome too.

Lack of character voice context during story game-play same 2-3 sentences said over and over again.  Some cut-scenes lag: Rear end of the car jumps around during a lot of them when the camera is close up.  Customization features are lacking even compared to some older more rubbish games e.g Need for speed undercover I have used this game because it did lack in a lot of customization features but i did find that in someways due to the age difference, the crew could have implemented a lot more customization feature. (Need for speed underground and underground 2 would not have been a fair comparison as there were way too many customization features in those games and they would have beaten this game hands down in this aspect.)   When you quit the game it does freeze when it is loading down and if i pressed the windows key the screen would remain black but i would have the taskbar at the bottom, they are releasing a major update soon as i did contact them about this problem because the only way i could actually get rid of this to use my desktop is if i did Ctrl+Alt+Del then signed out so i could sign back in again or restarted the computer using the restart button on my case.  i have had a couple of other problems of which i have told they about so they should look into sorting them out as soon as they can.  The Non Errors about this game is that:  It has amazing graphics.  You can run it at a stable frame-rate (i run it at 40-60 fps.)  The challenges are actually quite good.  The cars are stable and run very well.  The map is absolutely massive it took me ages just to get across a little bit.   I have many positive views about this game alot more than i do negative views, if you like racing game i would recommend this game it is very fun. If you do not like waiting for stuff or unlocking stuff this is not the game for you, luckily for me i do like that so this game is for me.

Pros:  Huge map Improved graphics Accurate sounds Stunning detail (for a racing game) Fairly enjoyable handling Photo Mode is amazing for wallpapers  Cons:  Poor amount of Japanese cars (I can literally list them. R34 skyline, 370z base game, BRZ and RX7 with Wild Run DLC) Cookie-cutter buildings Wild run is basically a must (bundled with main game for $60) Less than desirable performance (I have a 970 and run the game maxed + 4x TXAA at 1080p, runs at 55-60 FPS. Not bad but I've seen superior looking games get superior performance)",

            "review_text": "So far it's a great game. The biggest thing I don't like is that it constantly uses the internet, so if you do not have internet, or do not have a stable, constant connection, DO NOT BUY IT. Otherwise, if you have a bandwidth limit, beware when playing this game for a long period of time. This game also will send you back to the main menu if you lose your internet connection. The story in the game so far is good. I won't give any spoilers. There are plenty of cars in game, but you must earn a lot of in-game cash to be able to buy them. Car customization could be better, but this game isn't a simulation, so I didn't expect engine swaps, turbo/supercharger add-ons, etc. What's really cool is how you can modify cards for street, track, dirt, etc. One thing that bugs me is that the car sounds don't change when you switch said modification classes. For example, the Dodge Charger still sounds like the stock engine in a dirt/rally config. I did noticed when I upgraded the Skyline R34 from street to circuit version (R34 GT3), you do hear the transmission whine as you do in a race car. Kudos for that.  If you've never played this game, I should mention it is an open world like some of their other games (Far Cry, Assassin's Creed). You can drive from New York to Miami to LA, etc. Of course, it doesn't take as long as it does in real life (which is good), but it's a very neat touch Ubisoft added in for a racing game, and I hope other game makers use this as a template for street-oriented racing games.
