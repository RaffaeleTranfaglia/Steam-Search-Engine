What the developers have done behind the scenes to allow you to play this game to ANY song you import from your desktop is a very awesome feat of development wizardry. The visuals are fantastic and it definitely does have that 'classic arcade' feel to it. It's worth the price, trust me.",

            "review_text": "CONSIDER THIS GAME EARLY ACCESS. It isn't listed as such, but it looks like the game is still in development. Early in development at that. The developers have released some updates the last couple of months, and perhaps the game will get better if they keep working on it, but as it currently stands I couldn't possibly recommend it. The game has an interesting concept. I like the shooter aspects and the idea of the turns and boss battles. The ships look cool and it'd be neat to see how they change the gameplay with all the different stats. Unfortunately the game really doesn't work right now. A few issues:  - The only explanation of what you're supposed to be doing you get is the controls. There are powerups and bombs in game, but no explanation of how they work is given.  - The interface is extremely messy. You use the enter key to shoot and to open menus, which results in skipping over most of the menus. I died several times before I even realized I had because there is no alert other than the start menu popping up and your score resetting. It also causes trouble at the end of the song or playlist because it's very easy to skip over your score accidentally and not get to see it.  - Songs start to repeat from the beginning once they reach the end and then stop suddenly. This happened with both a single song and after every song on a playlist for me. It really doesn't help with the above issue either since it makes it harder to judge when I'm supposed to stop shooting.  - Achievements are very easy to get. I had no clue what I was doing and I only played four songs, but I've already got 58% of the achievements.  - The scores don't make much sense for user-imported songs. I apparently got a high score playing them, but the game didn't even list the songs anywhere. It seems like the score is based on how long you can survive regardless of what songs you're playing, but I think that's pretty lame. I didn't try the leaderboards for the included songs, and I'm not going to since they couldn't possibly redeem the game for me, but I'd imagine they're probably pretty dead.  I got the game in a bundle for less than a quarter but I honestly wouldn't even recommend paying that, let alone the full price. If you're looking for something with a similar concept I'd recommend looking into Symphony. It's a rhythm game allows you to use your own music and has both the shooter/bullet hell aspects and some in-song boss battles. It works a hell of a lot better. If you're just looking for a nice rhythm game that let's you use your own music Audiosurf and Drive Any Track are worth a look too. Don't waste your time or money here, there are better things available for less.",
