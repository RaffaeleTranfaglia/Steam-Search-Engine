            "review_text": "(Even though I got this game when it was in early access, I intentionally didn't start playing until it was finally out of early access so my review will be a reflection of that.)   Backstage Pass is a visual novel/simulation game where you take on the role of Sian Goodin, a young makeup artist entering university and wanting a quiet life. However, when an unexpected life event happens, Sian is forced to use her professional makeup skills to make it through the year. Backstage Pass plays as a visual novel so there are choices that reflect how characters will react, and there are simulation elements as well where doing certain tasks or jobs will increase skills and/or earn money. Money can be used to purchase clothing items and just items in general which can be used to increase affection with certain characters or help Sian improve her skills. Also, there are several locations to explore and, of course, many characters to interact with. While some characters do not have either friendship or romance paths, many others do, including the four main guys that you will notice right away when you access the Extras option on the main menu. In addition, there are paths where Sian doesn't have to be paired with any character, and these are various career paths, provided that the right conditions are met to get their various endings. Of course, as a visual novel, there are tons of CGs and lots of music tracks so there's definitely a lot in this game. I almost forgot but the characters are fully voiced as well, except for Sian (but her voice will be added in a later patch).  Now I'll move on to my opinion of this game. When I played it initially, I completed a couple of paths but I encountered a Steam achievement bug. Fortunately, the dev was very good in fixing the bug right away so I was able to get this achievement (as indicated by my 100% achievement completion of this game). Since then, I've found the game to be relatively bug free although some paths were more difficult to complete than others. Also, there were minor bugs such as when one event would occur for three weekends in a row or when a line wouldn't be voiced correctly. Despite these minor bugs, I found myself to enjoy Backstage Pass very much and I was invested in completing all of the paths to see what they were like. It's difficult for me to say which path would be my favorite but I'll name a few. I did like Matthew's (one of the main guys) paths as well as Alvin's and Nicole's paths (both of them being more minor characters but they become more prominent if Sian gets on their path). I even liked the professional paths, as Sian could still interact with various characters despite not becoming friends or romancing any of them.  Overall, I did enjoy Backstage Pass and I would totally recommend it for those who like visual novels and simulation games. It is a bit expensive for the price (even though I believe it would be worth it because there are so many paths to complete; however, if you're the kind of person who only plays one path, then it would be a little pricey) so waiting for a sale would be the best thing to do. Still, Backstage Pass is a fantastic game and I'm happy I had the chance to play it and see it through to completion. (Also, seeing all those extras added outside of the game itself makes it worth playing.) ^^",

But Backstage Pass was amazing! I haven't finished all of the routes, definitely just starting out but all of the characters have grown on me.   (Cough I love Alvin so much Cough)   But the story is great! I'm looking forward to finishing the other routes and getting all of the CG's   Which are amazing by the way.  ",
