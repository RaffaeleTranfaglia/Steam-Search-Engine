            "review_text": " Tomb Raider III is still totally playable on today's operating systems, and while short compared to some games of today, is still worth it.   For those that are unaware, these early TR titles tend not to vary too much in play style - it's an action adventure set in the 3rd person perspective, but you can't aim as Lara does all that for you, assuming enemies are in range and can be damaged   (although once you start firing it IS possible to continue to do so after moving out of range, provided you don't let go of the trigger!)  . Also, the camera cannot be altered, and enemies tend to have very limited behaviours/scripts, making it easy to (literally) run rings around them.  Lara begins the journey in a jungle setting initially. After completion of the jungle some degree of choice is imparted to us, but be sure to research into your acquisition of the rocket launcher, and the map that strips you of all your weapons. The locations are varied and different enough to ensure the game doesn't get boring too fast. India, the South Pacific, Nevada, London and even Antarctica round out the base game, brought to life with aggressive animals and improved visual effects.  Since the last title, Lara can now crouch and sprint in addition to everything she could do before. Sprinting is problematic - Lara steers like a brick while running, so you wont want to do it too often. It makes sense that any Tomb Raider worth their salt should be able to crouch and crawl, so this is a welcome addition to the (somewhat repetitive) gameplay. Monkey-swinging is now possible too.  There are some new ways to die too. Quicksand takes a bit of getting used to, but piranha-infested waters should be avoided at all costs. Fall in accidentally and before you know it Lara will be colouring the water red with no time to get out. Poison is introduced as well, mostly in the form of dart traps, but also from blow darts fired by natives with painful looking nose-piercings. The only way to stop poison is to use a health pack or healing crystal, otherwise it'll continue to deplete your health. Perhaps disappointingly, it is still possible to die by dinosaur though. I was surprised they weren't extinct in TR2 around the Great Wall, but now I'm just 'meh' about them hiding under rocks all over the world.  The 'then' impressive graphical improvements include smoking gun barrels after firing your pistols, water reflections, coloured lighting, better fire, rain and snow. I recall the problems on our 'then' computer and laugh heartily. Graphics should be a non-issue these days, but if they are, just play around with the setup options.  While there have been criticisms in the past about the violence in the series, I have no problem with it. Compared to some games the violence herein is tame. Killing military officers and police doesn't ring entirely true with the character of Lara Croft, who always seemed to me above that sort of thing. She does start her ventures armed with simple pistols after all, suggesting enough experience to know to expect trouble and be able to deal with it, but not so armed to the teeth as to go actively looking for trouble. Greater effort could have gone into the Nevada / Area 51 sub-plot to make it more stealth-friendly - stealth that is proven to have worked in the game in the case of at least one secret that requires no alarm to be raised before Lara reaches it. Shooting up police and military doesn't gel with the mansion-living, quick-witted, smart-minded, aristocratic Lara, in my mind.  Ultimately TR3 is an enjoyable game, and while it's showing its age (and despite the moral ambiguity) it is still very much replayable today.",

            "review_text": "Tomb raider 3 end the triology, however after TR1 and 2 , the game really feel ... stretched. The core game is the same, but it's bigger, more advanced with more mechanic, more however doesn't make it better.  An exemple is the plot, the storyline in TR1 was simple but efficient, TR2 was less elegant but you still could follow it. In TR3 it's all over the place with an abrupt ending that doesn't really make sence. In my own opinion, the team behind the game put it together in the last minute probably after some disagreement.  The game is built around those large levels but they don't seem to work well together, they're not horrible, but the difficult spikes, the bugs, the cheap deads make them very annoying at times. Making those levels bigger probably sounded like a good idea at the time, but they add to the difficulty as often I had no idea where to go or what to do next as the game is very stingy with hints . Trying and failing (often dying) was my only option. For parts of the game a walkthrough is necessary unless you feel like using weeks on end exploring the vast levels for small keys or crystals hidden in dark corners to open secret doors.  To make things worse , some parts of the game are positively dull, the London levels are the worse in that respect. They're dark, confusing and depressing with few positive moments, as a player you fell you have to plough through those levels and get them over with.  TR3 has its good moments, the core gameplay is there, solving the mysteries or finding your path in the sometimes confusing levels feels rewarding. But smaller and bigger problems in the gameplay cheapen those moments. The controll which never was very good hasn't changed much since TR1 and 2 making things harder for the player as they feel as uneven as ever in an environment that is bigger and more difficult than previous games. This results in cheap deads very often and the liberal use of saves and loads to progress.   The great atmosphere in the game is hit and miss, some level felt almost like the original tomb raiders, others felt just dark and cramped and I couldn't wait to finish them. To it's benifit they're varied, you even get to visit a couple of temples , but they still don't give the feel of awe the original gave you. TR3 isn't as pretty as TR2 either, and while it has its moment, it's easily the ugliest of the three.  In Conclusion, TR3 isn't a bad game , it's good in its core, but a miriad of problems and bugs makes it a lesser game than it could have been. Play only if you want to experience the Tomb Raider serie (as I do) , you'll have some good moments if you can oversee all its faults. I can't however objectively recommand this game to most gamers.",

You're given more variety in levels this time around, from the London metro system to a lost island in the Pacific ocean. You can tell that the series here is really starting to step away from exploring just tombs. But the platforming and fighting is still there and you're given new moves like crawling and sprinting.",

There is some good stuff in here but the atmosphere is missing and the gameplay already feels too stagnant, What is new is simply frustrating. Levels are designed to kill you. Many of the traps kill you even when you know what is waiting for you as they require super precise movement in order to avoid. It is not really welcome considering how clucky the game is.   I feel I managed to survive the game only due to being TR veteran. The puzzles are pretty badly designed. You will not know where you are trying to get or what you are looking for. You will often find keys and items to open up doors before you even find the place you are trying to open. There are couple vehicles in the game and they control horribly.  There is some potential here but the game needed new engine and better controls in order for it to work.",

An example of this is once you complete the area you are in, you have the freedom to go where you wish to next. The puzzles are very well thought out, and require you to either be quick or make no mistake, and with the return of quite a few classic enemies, weapons and mechanics, e.g losing your weapons, even secrets. One thing i don't really like with this game is that the controls are kinda sluggish, but get past that little problem and this game is worth the buy. this is for those who love action, with a healthy dose puzzles and brainteasers  all in all, i give this game an 8/10",

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider 3 repeats many of the mistakes of the second game.  There is far too much gun combat with many of the levels taking place in urban locations which makes no sense given the gameplay requirements. For instance, pulling a lever in one area to open a door in another makes perfect sense in an ancient tomb designed to protect the secrets inside, but makes no sense on a London rooftop.  I have no problem with the game's designers including the urban settings when in moderation, I just wish they had created the gameplay to suit.  Another problem I have noticed with this game is the occasional nonsensical puzzle element. I can't help wondering if these were included as a cynical way of selling strategy guides back in the day.  The story is also worse this time around feeling a little disjoined from the whole.  The series feels like it's running out of steam at this point with the developers just phoning it in. While the graphics, sounds, and animations have been improved, the same basic gameplay problems persist, namely the inane fixed camera that tends to show repeated close ups of Lara's backside rather than the ledge you are trying to jump to.  Still, I did enjoy this game, but less so than the first two instalments.  7/10",
