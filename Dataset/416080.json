But I would create my own genre called 'Phone app games' or 'minimalist computer requirements.' God Game: The Odyssey was developed by Liquid Dragon Studios and released in 2015, you play as the Greek Goddess Athena, your goal is to help guide Odysseus's fleet back home by controlling the wind, and water currents.     -Detailed breakdown review-   Story: God Game: The Odyssey follows the story of Odysseus returning from the Trojan Wars.  ('Ya know, the war all the hackers fought and e-mailed each other the Trojan Virus, there were many a computer casualty lost in these wars. Sad tale really. If I could write music I'd write an 'ode to the Trojan Virus Wars'.)          Uploaded for the review - 'story'&nbsp;",

I have only played the first handful of levels at the time of this review, so keep that in mind: You are given a set amount of boats that you have to get from point A to point B, there are obstacles and some objectives. Say you have 20 boats, you can pass the level by getting 5 boats to the objective without being destroyed, or you can pass the level with EXPERT by getting 15 boats to the end.  Definitely a cool concept and I would recommend it as an interesting puzzle/RTS. Very different from anything I have ever played so thats a +1",

Learning to play was easy, and they added more and more obsticles, and the Levels got harder and harder each time.   the goal of the game is really simple, kind of a reverse tower defence. You try to get the Boats from point A to point B and everything in between is trying ot stop you :)",

The Mechanics and physics of the game is very well done. You'll have reef/sandbar in the way that you'll need to move around. So controlling a few ships at a time helps.   Now I can see how the early settlers felt like in the Ocean. Like the God's were F*cking with them.   Would love to see some achievements for the game.",

When one thinks about the question of whether The Odyssey is a good game, only one incontrovertible attitude corresponds to reality: a touch screen interface would be more appropriate for this game. Any individuals falling prey to the view that frantic and precise mouse gestures are exactly what you need on PC possess an unsatisfactory adaptive capacity to reality-based frameworks of reference.
