            "review_text": "This little gem of an adventure game grows on you. Despite the main character being from Paris and talking in a German accent, the game is a suitably silly vampire story about an opera singer (who doesn't really believe she's a vampire) trying to escape a castle in Draxsylvania and get back to Paris. Her comedy sidekick bat sits on her shoulder and supplies plenty of sarcasm. There are some memorable characters, the voice acting is pretty good, and there's lots of jokes on just about every clickable object. The controls are decent, a few of the puzzles are illogical, but otherwise bearable, and the story gets better and better as the characters grow. Be warned that it ends sort of abruptly and was supposed to have been a two-parter, but the second game was never made. Some sort of information about that would have been nice up front, but it doesn't actually matter much. It's not too much of a cliffhanger, and the game is enjoyable enough that you can't really feel mad about it. If anything, you're sad you can't spend more time with the characters, but a prequel is in the works, so here's hoping. I couldn't get the game running when launching from steam, but running the exe file in the game folder worked.",

            "review_text": "A Hardcore Adventure game with many bugs!  Well, if you ever consider to buy this one,have in mind that it may be NOT playable in your system. The game has many bugs that make it a headache. Whoever tries to, please install it under C: directory. Don't know if you have Steam under C: but the Steam client accepts to install a game in whatever drive you want. Feel free to give administrator permissions and I hope it plays because it may NOT...  The graphics are good for an adventure game but I would like a widescreen but NO, there isn't. It has video cutscenes that make it good. It's all 3D and good looking.  The story is black. The game is attractive but after a while playing it you'll feel that you think black,too. After all the game is for late teens and adults. It has many things in the dialogues and in view that newer eyes would be sensitive. The game is full of black humor but ... it has really many dialogues and so many black jokes that in many cases it will be tiresome. You're supposed to be a female vampire that NEVER accepted her later nature and tries to free herself from her master and his castle. The game was written by some makers of Monkey Island series but no way,it's not like them, One more thing you have to consider is that the second part of the game NEVER been made. So, don't search why the game ends this way, leaving many question marks behind.  The sounds are pretty good. Black music and very good voices make the game excellent at this point.  The riddles. You will be SO TIRED of them. Even the hardcore Adventurer will want to see a walkthrough. The game never stops having riddles. Riddles everywhere. And the possibilities are many. Because you have always to compare the new and the OLD and try them too. And it has many things in the environment that you will NEVER use. I was really tired of this game. And if it wasn't an OLD quality game I would place a negative review. I place a positive one for the game. As much for the controls, keep 'Tab','Space', left and right click in mind.  If you want to buy at your own risk and the game is playable under your system,if you can handle so many riddles in a very short space, if you like so many lines of dialogues and black humor then this game is for you.  I would say that this is a Hardcore Adventure game with many bugs! ",

And because of publisher problems we will not see it any time soon. Rather difficult puzzles. The interactions between Mona and Froderik are the best part about the game, cheesy, fun and back and fourth like a kids cartoon.",
