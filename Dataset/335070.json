            "review_text": "VRC Pro is an RC simulation game from developer Virtual Racing Industries that is currently available on Steam as well as on the VRC Pro website. VRC Pro gives you access to the world of modern RC cars and racing and provides a method of training for amateurs and veterans of RC racing alike. While it may be intimidating at first VRC Pro is an excellent way to get in to the world of RC motorsport.  A word of warning, don't expect this to be an RC racing game because that's not what it is, this is a simulation game and a realistic one at that. Also I'd just like to say I've never really raced RC cars in real life, I used to own some RC cars which I used to drive around but that's about as far as my experience with RC cars goes.  +Great graphics +Realistic physics +All of the included cars (15) and all of the included tracks (22) are real +A good variety of different types of car and different types of track +A huge amount of customization options for the cars included as well as the ability to create your own from scratch +Has gamepad support as well as support for real RC controllers (adapter required) +The controls at first seem complex and difficult to use but once you get the hang of them they're great +Great performance +A fixed camera view as well as an up close 'following camera' +There is a practice mode for races, helps to familiarise you with a track before you take part in the main race +Practice cars (AI) are very good  +Several different game modes both offline and online +Good amount of people online and I believe it can be played with people who own the non-Steam version also +Provides a good way to enjoy RC racing without having to spend a lot of money on a real RC car +The developer is active on the Steam forums  +/-You pretty much have to play this with a controller, personally I'm fine with that but I know a lot of people get annoyed if they can't play with KB&amp;M  -You can't pause the game even when playing offline -Some of the tracks seen on the Steam store page aren't included in the Steam version of the game -Not all of the tracks have the option for you to practice or race against AI, kind of annoying if you're like me and only want to play the game offline -It's not very begginer friendly and it only has a very simple tutorial  Verdict: 8  A great way to learn how to race RC cars with realistic physics, great graphics, a fair few cars to drive and a number of tracks to drive them on. If you have any interest in racing RC cars then this is definitely a game you should pick up.  ***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***  El K.",

            "review_text": "This is probably one of the best simulator games out of all the simulators on Steam. When i was little i had my own little Nitro Buggy and I would always race it around our street. And i must say, playing this game using that Nitro Buggy that i built in-game felt almost as real as it did in real life, minus the sound effects wich in my opinion, is the only thing that bothered me about this simulator.  If you're into RC cars, then i highly recommend this simulator!",

I have two Bugis gasoline rc cars 1: 8 scale and control acceleration and braking is done with the triggers and not with the same joystick. Above does not give you the option to change these controls for the Xbox controller. That is to have bad milk. Until you change I refuse to play and not advise anyone to play in these conditions",

Cars from less well-known brands(Horizon Hobby) 6. Nitro Short-Course trucks(HPI Baja)  These are all the things I can think of right now, overall great game. Keep up the good work!",
