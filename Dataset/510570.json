            "review_text": "I'm going to write a long paragraph about this game. As much as I've played thus far, this Unity-based game is quite unique. You get to play the role of a ghost hunter sorta like the ones on tv, except you don't see with nightvision goggles and aren't searching for spirit orbs. You are blessed/cursed with the ability of psychometry at your disposal and you also get to have (take a deep breath) .....a flashlight! You point and click where it allows you to; to nativigate around the haunted estate with a macabre history. You also point and click to investigate clues/notes or to pick up keys or cursed items when allowed to. You have a basic inventory system that allows you to utilize those keys or items when you're prompted to do so. But (this is the downside), you don't get to do any free exploration and this I have to say, makes this game feel like it on rails. However, What makes this game FUN is that you'll feel that the manifestations or malevolent paranormal entities could try to appear and also try to kill you at ANY time. You never know what's going to happen next in terms of WHEN these haunting manifestations will occur as you are playing. Although this game has sequentialized jumpscares, you'll get to use that SPECIAL flashlight or yours to defend yourself whenever you are attacked, so you aren't completely helpless like most other indie games with jumpscares. I've encountered many (oH ♥♥♥♥! Oh ♥♥♥♥!) instances where I had to quickly turn my flashlight weapon on at a moments notice. The cool part is that if you get killed you have the option to pick-up right about where you were just before you became the ghost's 81tcH. Additionally, during the flight or fight encounters with these evil spirits, the paranormal entities do not attack from the same location twice so you're randomly being brutalized. The devs did a great job of creating a tense atmos-FEAR in regards to that. The music is creepy. The creeks of doors and drawers opening on their own, the random scatch noises, and the echoing whispers, voices, and giggling sounds of the spirits are astounding. The story is also fascinating in that you uncover in the beginning that a paranormal investigation team had been dispatched to the same estate in the recent past but their disappearance became an unsolved mystery. You're tasked at trying to solve the unsolve mystery of their disappearance while trying to excorcise the estate at the same time. That's just awesome right there. Try this game out when the free demo gets released. If you enjoy it like I do, then BUY the game.",
