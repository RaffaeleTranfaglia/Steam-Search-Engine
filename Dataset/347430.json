Story 8 of 10 The story is the classical Frankenstein Story retold with a little twist , to make matters short.It took me around 4 hours and I'm nearly done with everything , so I dare to say it's not that long. Still I liked the game.  Synopsis 7.5 of 10 Sweet , short little hidden objects game retelling the old story about Dr Frankenstein, definitely recommended for all casual gamers and hidden object puzzle gamers      ",

And this is a hidden object game. My expectations were low to begin with. To get even lower than that...  Only someone who is either high on drugs, or drunk is conciously able to create such BS; and this game makes sure that I will never again buy any game that was created by this studio.

Also, if you take a look at the screenshots, you'll see that it only lists four hidden objects at a time, which is a bit annoying. The adventure game elements are irritating too: every door has a wacky key, you lug around a hacksaw that apparently can't cut through thin metal bars, the fast travel is limited to the quarter of the map you're in, and so on. It is cheap, but there's only about 2 hours of game here, even if you're trying to 100% it. Stick to Artifex Mundi.",

Any object that has lost its usefulness will be removed from your inventory. But you can't use a saw to cut ropes. There's a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense, like rushing around a house looking for keys and solving puzzles when you have a pickaxe and a crowbar to bash the doors in and save your friends.

Pros - Beautiful environments and artwork - The HOS are a bit different in that you have find various objects to fit together to make a whole object.  - None of the objects you have to find are really difficult to spot, or have obscure names (where you're left wondering 'WTF does that mean?') :D - Lots of puzzles (some are a bit too simple) - Beautiful music - Good story (a little too sparse but definitely not a major problem) - Fairly simple game and a good afternoon filler. - There were some problems with gaining achievements but the devs have fixed those problems. I managed to 100% it with no problems.  Cons - I had one bug (reported on the Steam forums) where I clicked on an object but couldn't collect it. Exiting the game, uninstalling and reinstalling worked for me) - You have the option to always have the GUI showing. However, once or twice a couple of objects in HOS could not be seen because they were hidden behind the icons. - With the map, I thought there were supposed to be icons that told you which areas still had actions required. This feature did not work for me.  Anyway, if you like Artifex Mundi, you'll probs like this game too.  Hala xx",

There are different kind of puzzles, mini games and tasks to find many objects from a list in the screen. In these ones, sometimes you must combine objects of the scene with objects of the inventory, so it adds a plus of difficulty in this kind of puzzles.  You can choose the difficulty between: easy and difficult but there is no difficult instead.   There is a hint button in a corner to help you. Depending on the level of difficulty, it refills quickest and tells you which are your next step.  You move around the different places using icon arrows on the screen. There is a map that indicates if there are things to do or there is nothing to do in these locations. It also teleports you to one location if you click on it, so its easy to move around and solve puzzles.   The different locations are drawn in high resolution and characters are well modeled in 3D. There are a lot of animations that helps to explain the story and pre rendered cut scenes  Music is quite good and enviroment sound are normal.   The game has achivements and trading cards and you could finish the game in few hours obtaning all of them.  These guys have learnt of their last games, and they are improved the overall quality of their new game.  As all these kind of games, it is a great entertainmentto play during an evening.

            "review_text": "It isnt bad. Has some drawbacks, but for the price its pretty solid.   Graphics arent bad. Animations are better than what Im used to from a hidden object game, which is a nice plus. Voice acting was fairly standard voice acting. Nothing to brag about, but not bad. Music was pretty good, as were the sound effects.  Puzzles were interesting. I saw some that Ive never seen before in a hidden object puzzle (I wont spoil), which was a nice surprise. During hidden object scenes though, be aware that the UI sometimes covers the things you need to click. Clicking right below the UI towards the item usually works though.   Story was pretty nice. I enjoyed it. Really enjoyed the cutscenes.  The game over did it when it came to collecting sets of items and items in general. Towards the end, that was nearly all you did. Just collect sets of items to either start a puzzle, or open a container to get more items. Felt almost like they tried to draw the game out.  As far as bugs, I found a couple small ones. As I mentioned, the game makes you collect a lot of item sets. Some times when using an item set to open a puzzle specifically, the sound effects audio would ignore your audio settings. Minor annoyance, but becareful if you use a headset. There were also a couple times where I had to reload the game because objects in hidden object scenes would go unresponsive. I also have an achievement that wont give credit (for watching all cutscenes and dialogue), but I havent tried playing again to earn it.   Overall, Id recommend it. Item set collecting got old after awhile, with a couple minor bugs, but the story was more than good enough to keep going to the end.",

I would recommend going with hard mode from the get-go because it is not a hard or long game (only clocking in at about 2 and a half hours tops). You will often find yourself backtracking--this means keeping track of all of the doors and puzzles with missing pieces which will quickly get you confused and lost, though the hint button does remedy this slightly as it tells you where you should be going. With the entire map open to the player at any time though, it feels like an opportunity was wasted here in which the beautiful landscape of the game could have been further explored. I say this because in some areas you'll find yourself spending a lot of time, in others you will be there to collect one or two things and then never have to go back again. Some of the animals in the game move or make a sound when you go near them or click on them in and out of puzzles which is a nice touch. The voice acting has reminds of something that would show up in one of the films that the Cinema Snob reviews, so be prepared for awful things in that department; however, this does add to the all-around kind of Hammer Horror-esque feel of the game. Should you buy this? If you like this type of a game, yes, but I would recommend getting it on sale; I got my copy for under a dollar and I feel it was more than worth the price of admission.

I am quite good at spotting things, so I did not have much problems playing.  I do recommend this game, but overall it's just not my type of cookie I guess :)",
