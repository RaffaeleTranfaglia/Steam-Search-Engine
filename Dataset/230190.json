Today War for the Overworld is incomparable to what it was immediately after release. As the devs have cleared the bugs out of the way and continued to polish the game underneath, a real gem has emerged with it’s own style.  After giving up on War for the Overworld immediately after release, I went back a few months ago and had a blast, completeing the whole campaign. So far I’ve been loving the additions in this new Hearts of Gold expansion too.  I encourage anyone who was turned off by the initial mess to give War for the Overworld another shot. It’s now a wonderful game in and of itself, but more than that the devs should be congratulated and rewarded for never giving up on their vision.",

The thing that keeps me in the dev's camp on this one is reading their posts. This is a group of little guys, who are being honest and forthright about what's been going on with them, why things are the way they are, and what they are working on for the future. This isn't EA or Blizzard with obfuscation and double talk, this is by the fans, for the fans, and that kind of real honesty is uncommon in both gaming and life in general!   So, to the game. They have masterfully captured the 'flavor' of DK. I have enjoyed the mechanics of the different rooms, and figuring out the spells, rituals, and potions. The graphics are good, they favor the old game without looking dated. I'm playing often, but not constantly, as I enjoy coming back after patches and seeing how they are continuing to put polish on things. Personally am highly looking forward to more Skirmish maps, particularly larger ones! If you like DK, buy this game, and learn to love the progress and the game as is. If you like God mode games, and the idea of being Bad for the first time, well, come give evil a try! ;-)",

            "review_text": "Update April 11, 2015:  THE memory leak has been fixed, but the game has such poor performance across the board that the game is unplayable. Still crashes. Still many many bugs and unfinished things. I am way too frustrated trying to play through the broken, unfinished stuff with awful performance.  Beating the final 'boss' doesn't even make sense in the campaign. Maybe there's supposed to be some more cutscenes that explain it that aren't finished/added yet? The overall story is very poorly written.  The campaign is very short, only extended by game crashes or not being able to load game saves because of a 'gc too many threads' error. I'm guessing they beefed up the garbage collection to help with the memory leak but caused another bug in the process??  I can't spawn heroes from the hero gate in the 'My Pet Dungeon' level. I guess they didn't add that functionality yet? Also, I can't get any more of the errr experience points? So I can't unlock all the things. It's just so buggy. There's no real reason to play that level :/  I do not call this a 'spiritual successor' to Dungeon Keeper because DK1 &amp; 2 were actually good whereas this is not. It is not worthy of such a name or comparison.    Visuals: Poor. Low poly models and blah textures without any kind of shading (lighting effects and whatnot) on them. Environment art is better than the character art, but still doesn't feel that great.   Audio: Meh. They got the original DK voice actor, but he doesn't sound as good as I remember him being. He used to have a deeper more sinister or demonic voice. I miss that rumble in his voice when he said 'Keeper'.   Gameplay: Poor. Campaign mission design is weak. Just drop your flag on the enemies heart and it's over. Or get rekt by the AI while you're (graphically) lagging out.   Do NOT buy this game. Your money is better spent elsewhere. I kind of wish I could get a refund :/     ------------------------------------- Original Review April 6, 2015: I recommend NO only because the game was released in a very unfinished state.    There's lots of placeholder text.   Multiplayer lobby is broken.   Part of the 'Possession' spell's tooltip says that attacking and using the unit's abilities doesn't work yet. (It doesn't)   The first level bugged out for me. I killed the group of dwarves in the island but the objective never updated. I probably used the rally flag too many times or something. I don't know. I had to restart it and carefully follow the instruction and then it worked.   Straight up hard crash on the 4th level. It just finished the intro bit about how I have beasts and I was moving the camera around and mining stuff and building things and then suddenly the screen turned white and everything was unresponsive. Had to hard reboot my desktop.   I can't complete the 4th level. After reaching the other keeper, everything gets super choppy and eventually hard crashes my computer. This time with a bright green screen instead of white screen. I'm thinking there's an extra hard memory leak in it :/   Also, the textures aren't that high res and the geometry feels very low poly for a game being released in 2015. Maybe they're trying to really get that Dungeon Keeper 2 feel and visuals. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  Once the game gets patched up to how it should have been when it was released, I'll reevalute this review. I know the devs are trying hard (multiple patches per day since release), but I just can't recommend the given product right now.",

            "review_text": "Full disclosure: I bought in during Early Release, however I did not play the game extensively until 1.0.  This game is, by and large, a deep spiritual successor to the great Dungeon Keeper of old, complete with the same narrator in the background, along with the witty humour and dungeon base building concept.  It is brought to the modern day with a more modern control scheme, graphical fidelity, and delivery. If you've ever been a fan of base-building games and/or wanted to be the bad guy, this is your game. Fan of the DK of old? Its back, baby!  + Great successor and spiritual remake of Dungeon Keeper, down to the narrator V/O and core mechanics + Expands on the formula by ading new minion types (with different mechanics rules), minion behaviors, and artifacts that add new abilities + Looks great, feels just like a Dungeon Keeper game, and even sounds right, complete with the minion V/O you can hear from time to time.  - Release jank, and lots of it. No doubt it'll get fixed, but as I'm playing this right as 1.0 has hit, its evident. - Performance and stability issues, from crashing on exit, to FPS slowdown when a lot of worker minions are spawned. - (AT RELEASE, will likely be fixed by the time you read this) No Skirmish or Multiplayer Lobby working yet, as they've had to remove them to fix showstopper bugs. - Sudden difficulty spikes that can run away from the player, particularly the Dwarven survival campaign mission. - Options menu feels a bit bare - 'Possession' mechanic, whilst its in the game, feels just as janky as the original Dungeon Keeper one, complete with odd camera POV, lack of feedback on weapon swings, and when being damaged.",

It truly felt like I was playing the next logical step, or Dungeon Keeper 3, if you will.  For those uneducated and/or unexperienced in the Dungeon Keeper series, War for the Overworld is a strategy game where you play as the Underlord, the master of a dungeon that you build from the ground up. You dig out the earth surrounding your dungeon core and designate what the tiles that you have dug out are to be repurposed for. Barracks, lairs, torture chambers, prison, sanctuaries, traps, and many, many other rooms are available, all of which have their own unique abilities that they add to your dungeon and most of which that bring in new creatures to serve you in crushing the competing underlords and those pesky human armies that seek to reclaim their land from you.  All in all a great game and one that I highly recommend those fans who have been waiting years for a legitimate sequel to the Dungeon Keeper series.",

Knowing that this game was unfinished when I bought it led me to have some early reservations as I have been burned before on other unfinished games. But the crew that developed this game has been extremely professional and has an ear to the ground for consumer complaints. They have been very good at fixing and polishing their product which I have to say is a breath of fresh air in an industry that has turned from making great games to churning out substandard content in order to make money and decrease risks. I hope they continue on the path they are on and look forward to seeing what they come up with in the future. I believe that this game is one of the best in its genre which is saying a lot seeing as these type of games are dying out. Big name developers watch out for these guys. They are doing it right, and they didn't charge an arm and a leg to do it.",

The maps have almost zero creativity. Most of the time you can not even build a chain of rooms without indestructable blocks stopping you from setting up a decent functioning base.   The beauty of DK2 was the gameplay. Building you base, levelling your minions, gently probing the defenses of your enemy and destroying your enemy a piece at a time. This game has NONE of that!   It has next to no tactics or strategy involved. It plays the same way every time... Build some rooms... defend, defend...Zerg. Build rooms... defend, defend... Zerg.  The gameplay has all the subtly of a runaway train.   The voice acting is great, but it VERY quickly becomes annoying to the point of frustration at the constant yelling at you. Because all the game does is send enemy units to attack you, in every scenario... and almost constantly.   I purchased this on sale... and am SO glad I did not pay full price. Even so, I still feel ripped off.",

What's even more commendable is that it is still evolving and being expanded into something more feature rich and polished.

        {
            "review_text": "It's good but there's a few things that need to be improved.  What I missed the most from the DK games were all the little details that were put into creatures' personalities and traits. For example, you couldn't have spiders and flies share a lair because they hate each other. Bile demons hated skeletons because they're fat and skeletons are skinny so they wouldn't work together. A level 10 demon spawn becomes a dragon, a tentacle only comes if you put a lair next to water. There are DK ersatz characters in this game, like a succubus instead of a mistress, but they're not fleshed out much. I do like how, for example, the Auger is a slow creature, so you have to think about the layout of the rooms he uses so he doesn't have to walk too far, but most of the other creatures are attract and forget, which means you don't have to be particularly good at designing your dungeon. You just build things and wait.  Fights don't have a lot of strategy to them because all of the creatures feel the same. The ghost in DK1 for example, was a weak creature which could reflect magic and blow away enemies using wind, so you'd use that creature in certain situations. The bile demon was AOE, the warlock was ranged healing, the mistress was a kiter, the hellhound was for picking off runners and imps, the orc was a tank. There's not much of that here, you don't really need healers because you generally have so much mana that you can just heal creatures yourself. The creatures' offensive spells all feel the same. Everything feels bland and overpowered.  The lair and treasure room don't attract creatures and their shape doesn't matter, so you can just slap them down anywhere and forget about them. Boring. Make them do something.  The world map in DK1 was really cool, the way it was hand drawn and changed from good to evil over the course of the game. The one in this game isn't as interesting.  Still it's a good game and all but they need to take another look at DK1 instead of DK2 and see what made that game good.",

Its an RTS game with a twist. Your minions act however they see fit. You may influence their decision, but outside of the posession spell and the banner that says 'Attack Here' you and your opponent have little to no direct control of any outcome in this game.

            "review_text": "After playing this game for about 10 hours, I feel I can write a faily solid review in relativity to the state the game is now in under release.   This game is a surprisingly amazing throwback and spiritual successor to Bullfrog's series Dungeon keeper. The gameplay is a breath of fresh air in an industry over saturated with Indie Devs creating stale replications of more popular games.  This game features dungeon building (which is amazingly satisfying), RTS elements. And economic balancing. Kind of a Towns/RTS if you will. The game features 4 modes, Campaign. Survival, Skirmish, and sandbox. (Multiplayer skirmish)   Campain acts as a story setting and tutorial for the game's research system, building and running your dungeon effectively. With brilliantly evil voice acting, fun and exciting missions that challenge your abilities as an Underlord. Campaign will keep you busy for hours and help you refine your skills as an underlord.  Skirmish is unfinished but the basic format for a skirmish game is 2 or more Underlords facing off in an attempt to destroy eachother's dungeon core (Larger player games are being worked on) This game gives you a fully unlocked Veins of evil tree to research the rooms nessesary to defeat the opposing player.  Survival is very much what is says on the box, and like skirmish, is still relatively under construction. Survival places you in a premade dungeon and gives you 3 lanes to defend where opposing heroes will try and breach your dungeon's defences and destroy your core. Sounds simple right? Its hard. Really hard. Good luck.  And sandbox, a dungeon building wonderland, where the game gives you the freedom to construct a dungeon of ludicrous size, and this mode, as free as it is, will only last you a certain amount of time, as the lack of enemy contact makes it feel.. empty at best after all of your rooms have been made.  At the time of review I can give this game my approval and definetly recommend this to any person who is a fan or the original Dungeon keeper series. And anyone who is a fan of RTS and 'Towns' Style games. But do not be afraid to try if you normally stray away from these styles of games! This game has somthing for everyone, and deserves as many sales as possible.  However, this game is still for the most part, an unfinished release and I have to deduct points for that. But the negatives far outweigh the positives in my eyes, and everyone should keep this game in mind, even if you don't plan on buying immediately post lauch. Please keep this in mind.  Credit is given where credit is due as Subterranean games breaths fresh life into a industry that is lacking new ideas recently (At least in my opinion) This game is a work of art and deserves your money.  I rate this game a solid 6/10 in its current state. I'm sure the score will rise to a 7/10 or a 8/10 in coming patches.  I have had tremendous fun so far with this game, and cannot wait for more content to arrive as Subterranean games have promised in free updates post launch. If you are looking for a solid throwback to Dungeon Keeper, and a great new IP to keep you busy for hours. War for the Overworld Certainly deserves to be a game in your library.",

Holy ♥♥♥♥ was I wrong.  It's pretty damn great. Some minor problems concerning visual glitches and momentary freezes but otherwise it lives up to the reputation of Dungeon Keeper. The only major problem I have with War For The Overworld is how Mana works, I much preferred the mana system in Dungeon Keeper 2 where you are rewarded with a faster mana income from aggressive expansion but leave yourself vulnerable to attack. Sadly there is little strategical advantage you can get from amassing a large mana pool because there isn't a 'quick' way to get it.  The Developers clearly knew what they doing and what they aimmed to achieve with this game, and they succeeded in leaps and bounds. There's more than enough new concepts and game mechanics to make this title stand out from it's inspiration as a true spirital successor.  Well done.",

Here was a promise to pay homage to a favorite game of mine from when I was way younger, a game that has had few of its like since it came out.  This is what I expected: A dungeon building simulator where you build your lair, gather minions, train them, build defenses and then storm the opposition. To say that this is not what I received would be a lie but the thing is the game delivers things so clunkily that all enjoyment is simply sucked out of it.   Yes, you do build your own fully functioning dungeon... assuming you can figure out the actual mechanics of the game, that being the logistics behind the rooms and how the minions interract with them. You can have lots of fun reading through half finished tool tips and placeholders and see if you can make sense of it.  You do employ a workforce of diabolical minions... but again the game is not exactly forthcoming on details on how they function inside your dungeon and in combat which leads to cluster♥♥♥♥ combat scenarios in which you just pile your guys together and hope they come out on top.  You do conquer realms and bring ruination to your enemies... but through a story that appears to be missing half of its cutscenes and animations and this is assuming that the game doesn't crash or go through constant memory leaks.  I guess you could say that this game delivers everything that was expected, but it is done so badly that all the fun gets lost behind somewhere. There's a lot of good ideas here but the game doesn't take its time to explain how they work and some ideas never get used at all.  ",

            "review_text": "Love this game, feels like the next 'Dungeon Keeper' which players of the originals will notice the little nods to its roots.  +Plenty of content +Home Realm (Build at your leisure and unleash waves of enemies) +Humor +Variant Underlords (Each once has a different look to it and the workers)  -Fast paced -Skirmish maps included are small -Short Campaign  This is a great game, but I spent alot of time playing DK1 and DK2, and the way WrtO differs seems to be in its pace, more so in skirmish against AI, the thing I enjoyed about DK was the slower pace, once you got past the tutorial levels you would normally start on one huge map which you had to spend time gathering gold and leveling up your minions, where as this one kinda forces you to play fast and with limited space, so theres no extravagant massive rooms you can build since you really need to use the space you have effectively.  The units themselves are very nicely done, but once again it lacks the content DK had, so if you dont know, on DK you had to manage your minions, and by this I mean there wasnt just a single minion per room so for instance in DK if you got a Fly and a Spider, you would normally have to try and keep them in seperate lairs because if they bump into once other when they arent training or using rooms they would attack and try to kill one another, this presenting a challenge if you wanted to keep both but served as something you really needed to keep an eye on, whereas in WftO there is just one type of minion per room and a empire version, none of your minions conflict everyone gets along very nicely.  Now the 'Vampire' unit I do like very much, having to keep a steady supply to keep them appeased and in return you get a very powerful unit, so here im going to refer to DK1 and you can proberly guess I mean the 'Horned Reaper' which was the games icon, which the Vampire unit itself is a nod to, both units need 3 units sacrificed to get one in return, whereas the vampire just needs food to stay happy, the Horned Reaper, well he was undeniably the strongest unit in the game but came with the biggest price, if you held him for to long he got ♥♥♥♥♥♥, if you slapped him he got ♥♥♥♥♥♥, if he was bored he got ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and he would begin slaughtering your own minions for the damn well fun of it, and a level 10 version of him would wipe out most of your minons, which would make you either decide on building a seperate mini-dungeon and lock him in it til you was ready to fight or having to get rid.  Refering to the pervious point there was the 'Temple' room, which you sacrificed units to make ones you needed or the Horned Reaper, but it served a second function, any creatures rebelling or Horned Reaper going on a rampage you could drop them on the outskirts of this room and they would pray and calm down over a period of time, now when they rebel in WftO you pretty much have to take them down, I could be wrong but at this present time I cant see anyway to calm them down, showered them with gold/food and they still wont revert from rebellion status.  All in all the thing about these games is feeling like the bad guy, and DK did that great, WftO goes down the same road but doesnt give me that 'Evil' vibe, aslong as you have food and gold, all your minions will hold hands and slip to battle, but here I am just remembering how much I loved DK, this game gets frequent patches and updates so who knows, maybe it will end up that way, but it is a great game and the closest ive seen to being a 'Dungeon Keeper' for a long time and is definatly worth playing, more so if you loved the DK games.   TL;DR  WftO is a great game, I ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about how much I miss 'Dungeon Keeper'. :D",

You are even sometimes forced on a frozen screen while things are happening around you to perform certain actions. I got slid over to a room as I was about to give a dig command and it caused me to accidentally set a dig command on one of my outer walls that I could not undo because I was frozen on the other room until I finished the task.  It's a lot of very forced and heavy handed tutorial style tasks that I would absolutely love if you could turn off, but I'm not holding it against the game because even though I'm 5 missions in and they are still doing it I am really hoping that they knock it off sometime soon.",

It has a similar sense of humor, but maybe a bit more drab than the old DK franchise. I can see that the devs loved DK and wanted to make this as close to that concept as possible, but in too many places it falls just shy of the potential.  The old Dungeon Keeper games had some bad bugs in them that made them almost inplayable at times and unfortunately this game does follow that same trend as well. That being said, the devs have not given up on this game and appear to be trying to fix, improve, and expand on the game months after it's full release, so here is to hoping this game gets enough love from both players and devs over time.  All said, it does feel like Dungeon Keeper 2.5... I just wish it had felt more like Dungeon Keeper 3.

The narrator is definitely my favorite character, he is hilarious. The best part of this game, besides being evil, is that it is an RTS that feels like it isn't an RTS, you actually have minions that need taking care of, they eat, drink, sleep, work, fight, and get paid (and get tortured). You literally have to control your own society, while fighting the empire. Plus, in my opinion the campaign gets incredibly difficult as you get to Mira's Dungeon. I will not inform you who Mira is, because that could be a spoiler. There is really only one thing that I don't like. Every other Underlord is completely useless, they don't do anything except mutter giberish. I won't get into too much detail as that could also be a spoiler. Overall 9/10.",

The voice of the narrator is the same but not in the same style. This is not DK 3 but it is a good modern DK style game.   I have only played campaign and felt this was quick to play and the ending needs something doing to it but I enjoyed it. For £14 it was good, full price, no. I am glad I waited for this release than the early access and can say it worked on my laptop and desktop with only a little stuttering on the laptop (Win 8 integrated chip graphics).

            "review_text": "First of all I'd like to say - IGNORE THE METACRITIC SCORE!!!! It's only the score that it is because people started leaving reviews before the game was finished and before the 1.1 patch was released. This patch has been a complete revelation!  I know what many of you are probably thinking as you trawl through the reviews left for War for the Overworld......'I thoroughly enjoyed the Dungeon Keeper games and I'd really hope that War for the Overworld would live up to my expectations, given that it's not exactly cheap'. Well, as a long term Dungeon Keeper fan (I'm 28 now and played it daily when i was a teen, including a few play throughs as I've gotten older), I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.   I actually felt quite sceptical when purchasing this game, simply because I enjoyed the original Dungeon Keepers games so much. I often hype up something in my own mind to the point where it will probably disappoint, but I've been very pleasantly surprised.   This is about as close as you can get to a Dungeon Keeper 3. I think the creators have done a really great job of keeping just enough of the old Dungeon Keeper vibes to satisfy the DK fans (for example the resemblance of many of the units in the game - The 'Workers' are clearly Imps, the 'Chunders' who love to work in the workshop and have the ability to 'fart' as a weapon (much like my girlfriend) are Bile Demons and you also get a female unit that loves to torture your enemies in the torture chamber.....remind you of anything (except without my old favourite spell lightning).   Your creatures still need to eat but have moved away from chickens and now prefer micropiglets, and some of your old favourite spells are still available like being able to create more workers, being able to reveal parts of the map for limited time, and also the 'Call to Arms' spell has a 'Rally' option too.   I think what's really great about War for the Overworld is the fact that the developers etc have taken great care to only change or remove elements from the DK games that actually work to improve this game. Does anyone remember in Dungeon Keeper how if you had enough gold, you could build an unlimited amount of traps and doors all over your dungeon, while you sat back and used the sight of evil spell in conjunction with the lightening or cave in spells to kill all of the enemy units? yeh you can'y do that anymore, you now actually have to think a bit more and strategy plays more of a part. Your mana pool is actually now split between the number of workers you have, the number of traps you have and any spells that you wish to cast. This means that you have to find a balance between those things because you have loads of workers, you wont be able to lay any traps or cast any spells, alternatively if you have loads of traps, you won't be able to create many extra workers or cast many spells. This was a welcome addition to the game because it's makes things more challenging, but not too difficult.   The graphics are nice and crisp, even if the frame rate can take an occasional hit on a very busy map (nothing that'd bothered me too much mind), the sound effects are very good and actually quite funny in terms of the things you hear your creatures randomly say, and there's more than enough content to keep you playing for a while with multiplayer, the campaign and a survival type mode.   Overall I've been really, pleasantly surprised by this game and what I also think is great is that the developers are really looking after it when it comes to releases/patches/updates. They regularly make sure that they respond to requests from people in terms of improvements etc and they aren't just light touches either. When i first got the game, I felt a little sad that your workers aren't able to level up. After a few days they'd released another couple of updates which added the ability for workers to level and i noticed they'd fixed EVERY other minor bug that I'd experienced.   You get exactly what you'd want and would expect from this game and the aftercare provided by the regular updates etc. It's fun, challenging, addictive and you still get to feel very nostalgic if you loved the original Dungeon Keeper games. If you never played those games and are instead just contemplating buying this game - do it, you won't regret it.   Graphics - 8/10 (for what it is, i think they're great)  Sound - 9.5/10  Gameplay 9/10 (With several game modes and the fact that each time you play you can change your style - you'll come back to this time anbd time again)  Overall - 9/10",

The campaign is pretty good. *Most* of the missions were fun, but some were either too easy, or boring. I don't think it reached the quality of the Bullfrog titles unfortunately.

Because the game has like alot of features, and once you complete Campaign, you can also play with bots in skrimish mode, or go to sandbox to play some certain developer-made scenarios and maps with no objectives. Play with your friends or other people in multiplayer, and dominate them with your Dungeon core skills. And play survival mode which is still a prototype. This game is really good. The only problem I have with this game is the AI, if your aren't ust to strategy games, you'll have lots of issues with the AI, but when you've been playing strategy games and other type of games that are similar will have entertained for hours, days and even months.

The building-your-own-dungeon aspect will be familiar to anyone who has played the series this game is inspired by.

I may add more to this review once I have played more of it, but the only problem I have is the difficulty. Even in the early game, the gameplay is brutal.

Cons   - Whan your dungeon population starts getting a bit higher the game starts running a touch clunky (my pc specs are pretty decent)   - Units will sometimes get stuck on the edges objects in a room.

Don't worry, you get plenty of them hiding around the corner. And no game is complete w/ out flaws as well. That being the minimap. It tends to be hard to figure out where the enemies are coming from if you have a hard time seeing their position on the minimap. When the dungeon mentor doesn't say anything it makes it harder. There are only 3 skirmish maps and both are small (only 2 players per map). And I don't know if anyone else ha a problem with it but I personally feel there are too many gold tiles and many of which are in large chunks and appear too often in unconvenient spots so it seems as though the game is trying to force you to stick with 3x3 rooms or have a dungeon thats just one big cluster ♥♥♥♥ of rooms that aren't separated. I like to build larger rooms to spawn more minions from that room rather than having to keep building the same room over and over.

I suspect that this has something to do with copy right issues which make too many similarities with Dungeon Keeper a legal risk. I hope maybe one day there will be a mod with some of the creatures from the old games.  Though I'm not a fan of the unit and hero roster I did notice and greatly appreciate that units that you corrupt (convert via torture chamber) actually change their appearance and dialogue. Dungeon Keeper did not give me that.  The gameplay itself is honestly an improvement over Dungeon Keeper 2, and that is high praise indeed! Your minions are much more logically classified as either 'beasts' or 'intelligent'. So no more facepalm when I see animals drinking at tables or gambling away money... Only intelligent creatures get gold payments and can do research for example. On the other hand beasts eat much more food and require different approaches to training and separate lairs. I also like the addition of an alchemy room for potion making, but I'm sad to see no equivalent for the dark temple or my favorite: the graveyard.  There are also some very neat additions. One of the biggest frustrations I had with the original dungeon keeper games was that they didn't let me fill in areas with dirt. In this game you can for a little bit of gold.  Overall I'd recommend this game!",

War for the Overworld is a RTS game which puts you in the shoes of an Underlord: a mystical being which has the power of creating dungeons and using the forces of evil (minions and so...). The purpose of the game itself is to build your own dungeon, and that's where all the fun lies. Many Underlords prefer building traps, other train their creatures to death in order to slay enemies, others use a mixture of both. While doing so you also know how to use some magic that can help your cause. To build your dungeon you have workes to help you, just tell them where to dig, what to do and they will without fail. By creating space you can start build rooms that will attract creatures to your dungeon. Pretty interesting right? Well, the campaign is well done but incosistent: some moments are far too easy and some other are hell itself. I haven't yet tried the multiplayer, but the game is actively developed and I think there will be many interesting suprises with time. A game worth its money.",

It's not that this game is bad. Actually, if they corrected a few mistakes, this game could be very cool. Unfortunately, the couple of problems that this game has makes for a disorienting and annoying experience.   First, the color palette is inappropriate to the genre, and, additionally, it is distracting to they eye. Let's face it, dungeons are dark places that are lit by torches. Fluorescent greens, oranges, and yellows do not belong in dungeons, except in the rare circumstance where magic is present. Most of the time, dungeons are like dungeons. That is, they are cold, dark, and earthy. Just looking at this game for too long can burn your retinas. I advise against that.  Second, the camera control is very limited. I want to be able to get a greater view of the happenings in my dungeon, dammit. Making me stay stay close in scope in relation to the goings on in my dungeon makes me dissatisfied. I'm the CEO of the dungeon, right? Shouldn't I be able to see the greater picture?  Like I said. I don't think this is a bad game, but it lacks insight into the basic wants of the RTS gamer.",

The glaring difference between this and the previous 2 DK games comes in the level of level creativity and ability to explore. This game quickly becomes a giant dogpile of troops rushing to the end. It lacks the exploration element in DK 1&amp;2 that are so essential to the overall feel of the game. The zerg rush of the game gets so bad that rooms like the workshop are utterly useless. You can't build doors and traps because you are constantly summoning your monsters to engage the enemy or rush the end lair. You can't take any time because the AI is too agressive or the level is under a timer. Unlike the games predecessors that allowed you to meticulously plot your dungeon, explore every nook and crany for all the secrets and craft the army you want you are in an RTS scramble to build as quickly as you possibly can and that saps alot of the enjoyment out of the game.  I hope that if they release DLC (a 2nd campaign) the creators really sit back and change the whole tempo of the game. While the game looks like Dungeon Keeper it plays more like the Warcraft franchise. If I wanted to play Warcraft/Starcraft I would have picked that up instead of DK3.",

But I believe the hard-core gamers will understand me even if they will not agree with me. First: I don’t think that there will be ever any middle level or above Dungeon Keeper (DK) fun that will be pleased with this game. You know that for most of us, our scariest nightmare is either the developer or the game itself to be bought by the company gamEs for retArts (gEAy games). It is usually means either the death of the series, or the idea, or the product or the any original thing in that production or the producer group. We are already not expecting any creative or exotic or extreme ideas or games from a company who only focuses on sales thus only produces football, basketball and f. king racing games that have no atmosphere, no story, no emotion, no idea, no intelligence, for shosers. Yes these people are not gamers they are definite anti-social shosers who are not able to pick a ball and play at their garden, (or they can be minors but again same brain age) whatever… Hence we were not expecting anything that can satisfy us from the gEAy or any company controlled by gEAy as a sequel of DK, or Black and White (BW). That company is created for rounded games and for rounded people to kick so no offense for them. Second: On the other hand, you emerged from nothing in order to revive a cult game. Yes DK is a cult game with no similar and especially the first one was not designed for everyone. With the music, difficulty, ideas, strategies… it was unique.  - It was far serious than the DK2 - Even the names of the spells and the narrator were the part of the dark atmosphere - Game was not too short and there were strategic options on the map. - Blood-gore level was far more higher - The player and its dark army was the evil part however was not the strongest, there were characters like Avatar who can take your whole horde down at least 3 times.  - The game was difficult. It was not possible to finish the game in few days. - The map and the ongoing story were far more darker and had a perfect atmosphere - Music were dark and suitable to the environment - The creatures were giving the feeling of the intelligence - Even there were conflicts between some creatures such as wizards and vampires, bile demons and skeletons...etc. so it was difficult to organise the dungeon. - There were many details for captives, it was required different procedures to make them ghost, skeleton, vampire.. etc. - There were more torture machines and screams than the WAR for Overword and this was the main concept of the game so F… you. - Was not automatically finishing the level when you win the map Third: Yes DK2 was different. It has not got some of the above characteristics however it had some other things that made it acceptable as a sequel and successful for fanatics like me. - This time we had black humour and the deep darkness of the game was a bit broken by the jokes and short clips. - However the gore was there with more colourful wars, aggressive atmosphere and action. - The music was gone crazy. It was best experience I ever had with intelligence system that changes the music with increasing aggression in the game. The music was sometimes the war atmosphere itself. Many times forced me to possess and join to the bathe with them. - Ok spells were not mystical and powerful like DK… No plague, no armaggedon, no shield.. but still they were colourful and functional. Yes they really lack when you compare with DK but yes as long as you can have bile demons behind you and go to battle as a dark knight or dark angel aside with horned reaper…. Yes still acceptable - Horned reaper become an exceptional creature/character with a call function but hey that was fun. It was amazing to feel that artificial intelligence of heroes make you feel their fear they felt against horned reaper. - The game was not short again. She story was more colourful and rich. There were lots of levels with various difficulties. - Narrator was more active bit funny but was not NPC of the game who intends be the secret antagonist in the game. - Was not automatically finishing the level when you win the map - The king with two blades and stone guardians were epic at the end of the game. And it was a real feeling of shame when the game ended. We all wanted and desired for more. - Still we were the evil side there were no “corrupted king” that yells as “kill me hahaha take the flesh on me set me free because developers are bunch of story f…ing unintelligent midiots” Fourth: Ok we all know about copyright issues, difficulties of being an independent company, trying to develop something on a heritage of a good game etc. However If you are going to use the name “War for the Overworld” it means you have come up with something that can really be a continuation of DK games with higher quality and more offerings. Otherwise you can change the name of the game as “Dungeons” do not claim anything from the DK heritage, make a funny and rubbish game like this than we never blame you.  On War for the Overworld - We haven’t see any war above the ground. That name was intended for that purpose, you remember? DK3 was planned to be the story of rising over the ground from the dungeons… Even the funny game “Dungeons 2” made it with a way which combines Warcraft 3 and DK2, but you… nope sorry… - Game was ridiculously short. - Other underlords and their jokes were disgusting. - The creatures… Yes you have to offer new ones I can completely understand. And a succubus was a good substitute for the mistress. And ogre was a good idea. Beast master was different but not functional. But what the f… is a Chunder? Do you think that what you placed a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ troll in game and make it fart like a bile demon it will become a substitute for both of them? It is not even a Bileroll or Trol Demon. - Yes it became really fancy to summon a vampire and to feed them. Necromancers were good too and that ghouls may replace skeletons. But sorry you still lack of black knights and dark angels (or something that can be substitute of them) - Bile demons and horned reaper were signature creatures. I understand that you cannot replace them easily with something else. But you had chance to reference them in game. They were the atmosphere of DK and DK2. Not even a easter egg … f.. you!  - Titans…. No, sorry. They are neither unique nor add something to the gameplay or the atmosphere. Neither scary nor have a character. - Music? F… you! What music? - Story? F… you! What story? “the story of evil king that emerges suddenly and explodes all you dungeon and a traitor narrator voice”…. wow - Atmosphere? F… you! What darkness? What aggression?... none of them were available in this game. - That torture chambers are just a disappointment. You are the disappointment… - Spells… F… you! - Traps… I hope you someone sticks that blade lotus in your…. Nose. - … just tell me what do you offer more than DK and DK2?  You see if you are not able to do something good without Peter Douglas Molyneux why in the world you are over forcing your brains to do something that they are not capable of and ruin all of the product, idea? You see that that guy was in same conditions with you and created a game which is called GODUS and with that he may not be trying to revive another legend which is Black and White series however he created something at least as beautiful as B and W and made the fanatics happy.  So please go find and internship somewhere close to the Peter Douglas Molyneux and don’t touch the DK series again.   ",

The narrator doesn't an excellent job, but there's minimal cutscenes, and what bothers me the most is the performance issues and bugginess of the game - several missions I retried because my game crashed so many times, and often saves would corrupt and you'd have to start anew. This was more of an issue on the last handful of missions where levels were much longer.  In terms of difficulty I can't really say I struggled at all, the A.I. are particularly lassaiz faire, with the exception of Level 12 where you fight 3 'underlords' (referring back to a very similar mission in DK2, but their dungeon structure followed a straightforward pattern that I noticed very quickly (playing the level several times due to crashing and admittedly 1 or 2 restarts), however the last mission is very lacklustre, the enemy has a big base, but they throw very small raiding parties at you of size between 8 and 12 creatures of levels 6+, which is basically just a level farm for your minions, and you can attack whenever ready. The last mission was very glitchy though - loading in from a save just before a defeat (I was attacking and didn't notice a party) there were creature models missing, and the drawbridge was invisible. Also the ending is complete and utter bullcrap.  Aside from this, the gameplay was fun, I did enjoy it as I love RTSs and it also had funny moments. I have yet to play any other modes or skirmishes but it was a shame that it's so buggy.",

However, War for the Overworld seems to have a very dedicated Developer, and thier team found a workaround to my problem(Look at the comments for details).  The Gameplay is pretty fun, and the theme does not detract from the game at all. Building is a snap, researching is as well.

It's difficult to put my finger on it, but after going through the campaign I was less than impressed. It's missing that bit of charm that DK had for itself. Maybe it's because the campaign feels like it's just a long tutorial for each of the rooms and traps and ends suddenly without letting you enjoy your fully-unlocked tech tree.  That's not to say the game isn't good, though. It does very interesting things with rooms that DK 1 and 2 didn't, such as giving the 'props' in rooms an efficiency bonus for being near fortified walls. It's a mixed bag, though; rooms larger than 5x5 will have props stuck in the middle unable to get a bonus, so it's almost worthless building anything but 5x? rooms, but sometimes you have to simply to get the damn narrator to shut up about how the crypt isn't big enough for all the corpses.  The game also seems intent on getting you to advance. Dungeon Keeper almost never rushed you. You could stay safe inside your walls until the lack of gold forced you out. WFTO, however? I think even the tutorial rushes you. Not even just for the achievement involved with finishing it quickly; it's do or die ASAP. And that rushed feeling follows you through the whole game. One of the final missions barely gives you enough time to get your workers digging out a single room before the enemy breaks into your space, and it's a constant, annoying, boring fight from that point on, from multiple directions, with no rest involved and nothing but luck to see you through. My last two attempts at that level followed the same tactics, the same speed, the same room layout planning at the very start. Three hours after the first one started, a single mistake put me in an unrecoverable death spiral that really shouldn't have been unrecoverable, and the attempt after that was a cheap and easy win for me in less than 15 minutes. Pure luck involved, nothing to do with choices or careful planning.  TL;DR: it'll satisfy your appetite for a modern Dungeon Keeper game, but like chinese take-out you'll be hungry again after an hour.",

I've found myself yelling at the characters a few times when they seemed dumbstruck and just let themselves get hit without damaging back. The camera shape on the map doesn't seem to represent the area you are viewing on the screen either, it just feels off. This makes using the map to click to a different area very hit or miss. The levels do feel like they force you to complete them before you really want to. Quite often I'll hardly have established any base and I'll already be fighting the enemy and once you start they just continue to keep rolling in. I wouldn't mind but its starting to feel like this is EVERY level but aside from those bits it seems to play really well.",
