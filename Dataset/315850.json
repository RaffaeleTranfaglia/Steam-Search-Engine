If you have never played those games or if you are too young to know what I am talking about then this game is still for you.  Amazing Princess Sarah is a retro platformer with a modern soundtrack that pays homage to the much underrated Super Mario Brothers 2. The level design is tough but not impossible and the bosses are fun a quirky. There is also a surprising variety of baddies with cool powers.  My criteria for a good budget game is 1 hour of fun for every $1 I paid. This is a $5 game and I am pretty sure I will get at least 10 of fun out of this one. So if you are looking for a super fun game pick this one you will thank me.  Please check out my gameplay video          YouTube™ Video:  Amazing Princess Sarah Steam on the Cheap Episode 9&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "Like classic Castlevania style platforming? Like jiggly well endowed heroines?  Then someone made a game just for you!  The game, while short, is certainly worth it's low entry fee, and is a lot of fun with some limited replay options. The game is hard but not to the point of utter frustration. The mechanics are simple and familiar, requiring no tutorial and letting you jump right into the game. There are only three main actions, jump, attack (simple left or right jabs) and the main gimmick, being able to throw fallen enemies and background clutter. The fallen enemies each have a set attack that is performed when you throw them, making them useful as a one-time special attack to get through the levels.  The platforming requires a lot of precision and seems to have little forgiveness or feedback for making a mistake, if you go just a little too far to the left or right while jumping you may end up having to repeat a whole section. Check points are fortunately well spaced and each one leaves you breathing a sigh of relief once you reach it.  The combat is perhaps what takes the most getting used to, your basic sword attack lacks any sort of real punch though you can kill well enough with it, the main mechanic is throwing things and finding out the best place and time to do so. It takes some getting used to but is fun all the same.  Finally the visuals are pretty good, the backgrounds are a bit lackluster but get the job done and the level design is very game-y there for pure challenge, and lacking true aesthetics. The sprite work is top notch and each enemy is well drawn and animated. There is quite a bit of fan service in the designs but not so much as to turn off those who might otherwise be distracted by it, I rather enjoyed it though.  There's not much of a story to speak of, the game is just pure clean (or maybe dirty) fun!",

Same level with some kind of malus effect and higher lv enemy. (add replayability but you may get bored)  The control work well with rebind key. didn't have major issue  The design layout is fun and annoying. (those annoying bats) THe boSS are okay.  One boss wasn't easy where he can't don't hit you (safe place hit box) The camera don't follow down fast enough at some point Some sound can be a little annoying. but the music is nice.  Not Epic and a little short but worth your money if you not annoyed. Recommanded.",

            "review_text": "At first glance Amazing Princess Sarah looks like a promising platformer with some interesting elements to keep you going. This all stops at level two and all of a sudden the game starts to show elements that become grating.   Enemy placement goes from thought out to stuff the room and just call it hard.  Speaking of enemies many won't even do that much damage, but are exceedingly frustrating because each hit causes knockback and causes you to drop whatever you're carrying which is a real problem when you can't reach important enemies with your tiny melee attack.  Enviromental hazards often match the color of the background and are difficult to see, and sometimes they'll be at the bottom of blind drops.  The first few times you see the level up prompt there's a bit of excitement, when you realize it's just a small scaling to your health and damage being stopped for a few seconds becomes more of a hassle when moving through a tough patch.  I hate to burn a game that is supposed to be a fun 5 dollar fix but when you give up on fun for frustrating mechanics and being only stubborn enough to finish it I can't reccomend this.",

            "review_text": "I would like to preface that I wanted to like this game. I really did. However, this game feels unfinished in general.  The game has a number of small missing details from a complete game, such as music during game over or when the levels are cleared. Instead, it cuts the music entirely. Likewise, there isn't much in the way of enemy variety. The few that exist are merely recolored over and over to indicate that they're stronger/faster. Levels go on far too long, and are poorly designed. Even the basic concepts like the combo system is poorly implimented. THrown enemies, for the most part, can only kill one enemy when they hit them. Theres no domino effect to kills, nor any reliable ways to get high combos beyond meleeing enemies in a small group cluster. All in all I'd say avoid this game. It feels like someone's first project in game maker, rather than a completed game.",

She just slashes a pathetic distance with a sword and throws things. She can't duck, her animations suck and she has nothing special about her what so ever.  Overall the game is generic, poor and uninteresting BUT that's only half of where my complaints come from; the other half of my complaints come from the disgusting amount of white knights, feminazis and trolls that the discussion/community page this game has. 'HUR DUR WHY DOES SHE HAVE LARGE BREASTS?', 'HUR DUR WHY IS FEMALE PROTAGONIST A TAG WHICH IS JUST HIGHLIGHTING HER SEXUALITY AS THE MAIN PLAYING POINT!' ♥♥♥♥ off, you autistic ♥♥♥♥♥; it's a ♥♥♥♥ing game!  Worse community for a game i have ever seen and i've played some really bad games. I just thank the devs for not making this game have multiplayer; that's the one compliment i have for this game.",
