            "review_text": "Let me start by saying this is the most fun I've had in a long time with a video game.  I used to be a really big fan of the Dance Central games on Xbox when they first came out. A friend of mine got the game for Christmas and I'd go hang out with him every day and we'd play until we were too tired to even move.  Not being a fan of consoles, I hadn't played any dancing games in a few years until today. I'll admit I was a bit skeptical when I saw Just Dance 2017 on the Steam store, I thought maybe it'd require VR or something, so I went to check and nope, just my phone and my PC.   Installing the app on my phone was pretty easy, it's a download of about 75Mb. I downloaded the app, followed the instructions and everything connected with no problems at all. The only minor issue I had was that nothing told me to log in to my Uplay account on the phone, so I played through a few songs on a default account and didn't get any progress on my Uplay account, but that is frankly not a problem as I'll be playing those songs again for sure!  I'm not sure why so many people are having issues with the free 3 months of of Just Dance Unlimited. As soon as I was done making my profile, it activated the 92 days and I instantly had access to all of the songs available.  The game itself is incredibly colorful. At first I thought it may be too much and make it difficult to concentrate on what the dancer on the screen is doing, but they actually make them 'come out' or contrast a lot compared to the backgrounds, and I've had no issue whatsoever following.  I really love the song choices, of course there's over 200 of them and I haven't had the chance to try them all yet, but so far I've got to say I'm very pleased. Even some songs that I wouldn't usually listen to, I've had a lot of fun dancing to, simply because the choreography is well made and fun to follow.  I played 7 songs in a row and I must say, I am currently covered in sweat. I'm not going to lie I'm not in incredible shape, but I wasn't expecting such a workout from this game. Most of the songs I played made me jump around and move pretty much every part of my body!  Long story short, if you're a fan of dance games, buy it! I haven't had this much fun in years!",

            "review_text": "the game doesn't use a camera but you can score by syncing the game's app called 'Just Dance Controller' and the game. It doesn't have any video options which is a bit sad but the phone controls are good. no crashes so far. The phone must have a gyrometer in order for the game to analyze your movements.  If you have friends that wanna play, you have to let them connect to your WiFi which is an inconvenience because you have to change the password every time after that and you can't let a child play the game because they can't dance with a big phone on their tiny hands. I wish it will support a camera in the near future.  All in all, the game is a must buy for dance fanatics.",

            "review_text": "I already have an early version of Just Dance on a Nintendo Wii console. It is a fun game that needs you to kinda believe that all your dance moves are being monitored and scored rather than just the the movement of the controller being tracked.  Bought this game because the description and reviews convinced me this was a completely new version which used all the tech in your mobile phone to somehow track your funky dance moves more accurately. I would have been impressed if it worked like that.  In fact the 2017 PC version is, fundamentally, no different to the original Just Dance other than being alot flashier. The single controller tracking remains the same, only now the controller can be your phone.  The fun can still be had by going along with the whole dancing thing but, for me, it's just an expensive version of the Wii game I already own.  Perhaps, if you don't have a games console, you may have fun with Just Dance 2017.   Not for me though. Gonna seek a refund now.",

Even though its 50€ you still get 90 days of 'Just Dance Unlimited' and it will give you 200+ songs (it would cost you additionally 10€ for 90 days) . and anybody can play this game with or without your smart phone, kids, parents, friends.... Its hella fun game, dancin around your room like a moron :D",
