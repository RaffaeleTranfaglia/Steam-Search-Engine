You will likely need to run this game in compatibility mode for XP and the resoltuon maxes out at 1084x798 although if you go to MyDocuments/Praetorians and open the user config and change Game Res 2 to Game Res 3 you can run it in 1280x720p. Game still holds up, super fun and brings back the nostalgia.",

You dont need to download that file from that guy who says you need to go and download the game all over again or something like that. All that is needed to do is simply change the compaditability mode to either one of the XP Service packages and the game will run smooth and fine.  Either way, ive barely played the game but i can tell it will be fun. So just do what I said above and youl be fine. if not, then you will need to download that file, sorry to say but I just thought instead of downloading whatever that guy said to download, why not just put it in Xp service 3 package and it works. No need to tweak anything else.  Have fun with your memories :)",

            "review_text": "Terrible. The game does not work, Apparently because the steam version is not optimized for newer PC's, and it didn't even say in wasn't optimized, according to my research. If it is true, DO NOT GET THIS GAME. Maybe, If they patch it, I will recommend it,If it is to my liking. It probably will, Since I study the Ancient World, so it will interesting. If you Like Rome: Total War, and you have the PC needed,(It might be hard to find if you have the right PC considering that it doesn't tell you easily) I recommend it.But if you like R:TW but doesn't have the right PC, like Me, I would recommend that you wait for a patch. But from the looks of it, It looks like a mix Between R:TW, Stronghold 2 and Age of Empires, 2 which i like. (If You are a strategy fan, I think you know which is the bad one.) If you are looking for an Ancient Rome strategy game, get Rome:Total War instead. If you are looking for fast-paced RTS, get Age Of Empires 2. But if you have the right PC and not much money, this game would PROBABLY be a good choice. I hope this was helpful to you. -PixelationNation   PS: If it IS optimized for newer PC's, Remember that this info' was found on the Internet, and you know you can never trust the Internet.  EDIT: As it turns out, you CAN get this working for PC's like mine, You just Run it through the .EXE file. But still, No-one should have to do that. As for the ACTUAL GAME, it is ok. It's no Rome: Total War, But it's not as bad as Stronghold 2. I see reviews saying that this is very nostalgic for them, and I can understand and respect that, Because back then there wasn't a whole lot games like this. I would probably LOVE this game, if I haven't played R:TW before, But since I did,and i think R:TW is the best game ever, I think this game is OK. but since it's very cheap, I would recommend getting this game, if you like Ancient Rome games and for some odd reason You can't Get R:TW. The best reason I can think is that you already have it. But saying that, Praetorians isn't THAT historically Accurate, sure it does have some True History, But some things are Quite Silly. But I would recommend getting this Because it's very cheap to get this game, and the game can be enjoyable.",

Praetorians is only 59p, maybe less now! See there are advantages to old games! It's a tactical strategy sort of game (and 50% close the page and look at 'C.O.D. : Black Ops 3' ) But it's not boring and very enjoyable, it's a good challenge but not too hard. But don't be fooled, I don't think the multiplayer works me and my friend tried it, but if you get it to work message me please. All in all a very good game I recommend it,  Doge master out,  Doges for life,  Peace...",
