            "review_text": "Overall, I had to say that I enjoyed playing this game. When I first started it, I was encountering some crashes but someone's suggestion on the forum quickly cleared up anything and I never saw a crash since. Regarding the gameplay, I enjoyed it. The combat did feel grittier than a Souls game, and I like how the magic in this game was much more 'supportive' rather than primary, as it can be in a Souls game (as an aside, I feel like magic ruined Dark Souls 2, but that's just an aside).   The boss designs were decent--they could use improvement, but I did enjoy some of them. I also did enjoy all of the little details they put in the game, like different ways to defeat bosses, different ending paths based on choices (which did seem a little hardboiled at times but was still a nice effort none the less). The only thing that frustrated me from time to time was the level design, which seemed labyrinthine.  There's lots of weapons in this game, and plenty of loot. The armor and weapon design were all decent.  All in all, is it 'Souls-like'? Yes, it is. Do I care? No. It's not like Dark Souls was the first Action RPG. Is it a fun game? Yes, yes it is. Do I hope they make another one and improve upon the first? Yes.  I think what sometimes people forget, especially with original titles is that to criticize it needlessly and blast it with negative reviews, and to make statements such as 'don't support this publisher', will ultimately lead to less variety, innovation, and entertainment. This is not a defense of bad games, but it is a defense of 'improvement'. If they make another, and I hope they do, I hope they can improve the formula, add some additional features that make it interesting and continue to innovate on this extremely fun genre. The more the merrier, I say.",

            "review_text": "Lords of the Fallen is a third person action-role-playing game with heavy emphasis on melee combat mechanics and tactics.  The Great:  - Melee combat is exceptional and some of the best in the industry - Significant weapon variety that leads to numerous differing yet satisfying playstyles - Each weapon's unique playstyle feels great and is fun to experiment with - Combat is timing and pattern based making each encounter important and fulfilling to complete - Game is gorgeous to look at even with details turned down  The Good:  - Environments are beautiful and intricately crafted (if a little small) - Enemy and boss designs are interesting and show creativity  The Bad:  - The story is forgettable, confusing at times and makes little sense given the scope of the game - The side characters feel tacked on, tropish, and overall of little value or consequence - The main character is meant to be a jerk, and there are few options to choose not to be a jerk - I experienced several game-crashing bugs over 25+ hours  Conclusion:  The game is buggy, and the writing of the characters and story leaves much to be desired, but the combat in both its precision and variety is able to save this game from the trash pile and ultimately make it one of the best RPGs of the year.  9.0 / 10.0",

In a way that was a good thing, going in with low expectations and being pleasantly surprised. The things that made me happy about it:       Good graphics     Gorgeous environments     Framerate not capped at 30 (ahem)     Difficult mobs/bosses     An actual storyline    I had a read through many of the negative reviews and a lot of it is down to personal frustrations. While in some places the game is actually quite unforgiving, I didn't think it warranted such negativity - difficulty spikes and overcoming them are part of the excitement of playing games like these. The lesson I learned here was to take these Steam ratings with a pinch of salt.  But to each their own, I will say - if you like fantasy-setting style games with difficult yet rewarding fights, try this out.  I would advise you to have a look at a class guide first - I went in as a Solace Rogue and had a very tough time at some places but did manage to complete.",

PROs:    It's hard, to me personally even harder than Dark Souls was in the beginning. Maybe because of my non-standard starting combo (Hunter, cleric magic + rogue), maybe because I keep pressing B to dodge-roll instead of A.    Combat is amazing, the controls are smooth and very responsive.     'The more enemies you beat without using a savepoint/spending xp, the more XP multiplier you get' feature.    Loadscreen hints explaining stuff that I just had to google for Dark Souls. You might prefer it otherwise, I like when I can find all basic info  inside  the game.    It looks absolutely friggin fantastic...    CONs:    ... if only Nvidia Turbulence wouldn't cause very frequent crashes (on a GTX 970 mind you, 0 crashes when disabled) it would be even prettier.    Story feels kinda 'Yeah guys, we really should add  some  story'. A rather easily ignorable con for this game tho.    A weirdly massive difficulty spike for the area between the 3rd and 4th boss really frustrated me :D   ",

            "review_text": "Length of Game: 10 Hours  Optimization: Awful, worst port I've ever played,  Difficulty: Difficult at first, far too easy 3 hours in.  Design Choices; Bad  Don't buy this game. Don't support the developers and don't think twice about it. To detail why I don't think this is a good puchase, I'll start with the enemy variation. This game does a good job initially at giving a wide variety of enemies to fight. They all have unique ways to kill them and they stick out pretty well. A few hours in, you will not only be fighting these same monsters, but you will get a few more that are anti-fun to deal with. It's not that they're difficult, it's that you either have to wait forever for an opening or they have mechanics to bore you to death.  Allow me to explain, using 2 enemies as examples. There are very large soldier looking characters with a big shield that will block all your attacks. You can't kick their shield out of their hand so you're left with two options. Wait 14 years for them to lowe the shield to attack them or sprint at them and bash them with a tower shield. Once you do option 2, you realize EVERY enemy is weak to that. How very exciting, eh? Second horrible mention is the mages that not only explode when they die, but pretty much have a kill move if you attack them during a certain period where they put white sparkles around them. They do a TON of damage as well, which isn't necessarly horrible, but it's very cheap when you're beginning the game and when you kill them, they explode and kill you, forciing you to keep doing it until you figure it out it. And while this wears its novelty off fast, you will encounter these things when you have plenty of health and they don't hurt you, but they still knock you down every time they explode, making it increasingly annoying.  Let's move to bosses. 4 of them will most likely be somewhat difficult for you, probably. I killed them in one go, and those first four bosses is the hardest this game will ever be. The rest of them you either have too much equipment, or they just don't have interesting enough mechanics to worry about avoiding. It becomes a mess, where your character is so Godly unstoppable that you juts completely wreck everything on screen. It might be fun for some people, but given the way the combat system works in this game...it feels very cheap and hollow. The reason for this is, you have a stamina bar, so you're not just going to wrack up tons of kills altogether, you STILL have to wait constantly for that to recharge, but without any challenge or thought as you progress in the game. Rather than having to deal with difficult situations or enemies, you're dealing with boring enemies that you meet in the first 3 hours of the game, and bosses that die in a few hits. It's very flat and not fun.  Graphics are great, they look nice and have an art style that anyone who plays World of Warcraft would most likely enjoy. They are not, however, optimized, and you will crash more than a blind person in a food store. You will find enemies later will explode, which is a boring as ♥♥♥♥ mechanic by itself, but will often cause the game to crash to desktop. This happens REGULARLY on the most annoying ♥♥♥♥ing stage in the game. There's a maze like area later in the game in which you have to pull 3 switches and these fire dogs are EVERYWHERE in it, and ONE of them will crash your game. This is ridiculous beyond belief, there's not way this should have gotten through Quality Assurance.  While the game has just released for almost a week now, the developers are trying to show care and fix their game up, but I feel the damage has been done and hurts their credibility. If they cared to fix the game up, there's no way they should have had so many game breaking bugs, bad balancing and generally boring gameplay. If you're looking to scratch that Dark Souls itch, I highly recommend playing Dark Souls 2 on NG+. as they add completely new monsters to areas, and add more boss mechanics. Or whatever your favorite game is, don't let me tell ya how to think.  Thanks for reading!",

            "review_text": "Hello all, first off, i haven't played dark soul so this review will be for the standalone game and no comparison between it and DS.  The game remind me a bit of bound by flame, or even darksiders 2. The sad thing about is that most of the game, the stamina bar only feel like it is there to slow the action down. I can understand the wish for realism, but getting winded in 3 swings to instantly recover 2 seconds later.., i am not a fan of the mechanic as a whole. The game rpg roots are solid, using xp for ability and spells investments rather than actual level up (each investment count as a level up and require more to increase as you do it). Along with that you have a gamble mechanic where you can lose XP. Being defeated drop a xp ghost that you have to gather back or recover using items, otherwise the xp is lost. The more enemy you kill in a row without stopping increase the reward gained which is enticing, as some players may want to challenge themselves and end up with 40 levels worth of upgrades sooner than expected. The bosses tend to be challenging and require patience or varied approach as your game play style can greatly vary depending if you're the heavy armor self healing type or the nimble rogue-style stabber. The game visually remind me of dark fantasy settings and is passable. At launch the game had a few stability issues, but they have since been fixed, for me at least. most of the few bugs i have seen weren't game breaking.  The rest of the game is a rpg experience that focus on action and combat rather than storytelling, which may be something some players are looking for these days. It is not my best rpg of the year but, with the replayability, i am still glad i bought it.  Have a nice day all!  -Lost",

(Patch 1.2 improved the game greatly, just completed first playthrough. Highly recommended as of now) Supposedly the companies first big budget title (can't confirm or deny). I for one, welcome our new western dark souls overlord.  Pros: -Plays like a slower version of Dark Souls (Combat wise) (Huge perk imo) -Neat moveset variety (Per weapon, One handed, two-handed/duel wielded and a magical gauntlet) -Everything feels like they have weight to it (Heavier weapons will feel heavy, large shields will be near impenetratable) -Amazing graphics and breathe-taking views. -Replayability due to different playstyles, magic selection and NG+ (up to 3 times) -Decent upgrade system via runes (Discovered some weapons can change if you use the proper runes on them) -Lore is available if you want to look for it -Very fluid combat (Any attack into any attack) -High risk, high reward style of play is rewarded (Obviously, by name itself) -Intense moments where it's either kill or be killed -You can spec heavily into your playstyle (be it heavy weapons, a flurry of lighter blows, turtling -Enemies all have a niche, although sometimes shared (Immortality until you obtain their heart, two lives, tanky/high threat) -60FPS/1080P or potentially beyond ( I can now run max settings with almost no fps problems ) -Most cons can be easily fixed with a patch (They have just done so)   Cons: -Randomly crashes, one known to me with the fire-fiend explosive enemy(ies) (FIXED) -Major performance issues outdoors (FIXED / IMPROVED GREATLY) -Upgrade system is small and could be expanded upon (four choices with different rarity/power) -Once you know an enemies' weakness you can easily exploit it for a quick win -Heavy armor is easy mode and basically required unless you drag a fight out (Rephrase- more forgiving than relying on dodges alone which can be difficult) -Sidequests can be cut off by progressing too far into the main story -Most of the lore is hidden within discriptions and items you randomly pick up and not get a prompt to delve into. -You can't tell if you're going the wrong way until an enemy wrecks your ♥♥♥♥ -Reused areas and replaced mobs when you defeat a lord (Game always has you returning to places you've been (zzz same environment) -Borrows heavily from Dark Souls (Combat, some boss moves (I.E. Worshipper's ground spike move reminds me of Gravelord Nito's blade dance/scream) -DON'T LOOK AT THE BLOODY SUN, OH GOD MY EYES, LENSFLARE EFFECTS -Blotchy 'snow sticking to camera' effect, bland hexgon like shapes.  Protip: This is an opinion, please don't argue it.  Edit: As of a couple hours ago patch 1.2 rolled out, I can now highly recommend this game as the crashes I have encountered have been fixed and outdoor FPS and other performance issues are a lot better. A week from release and they fixed their game pretty damn well.",

At the moment it's defective and shouldn't even be for sale without a warning that explains as much.  Edit: to add more details for those wondering;  I have left my PC running at times as I do other things, I've probably played under 10 hours. I'm not saying this is a bad game or not worth looking into, especially if you love the souls games as I do. What I'm saying is buying this game now may severely reduce the potential enjoyment you can get out of it. I've lost progress from crashes, I've had crashes halfway through boss fights 3-4 times in a row, I've had to save my game reducing the XP multiplier out of fear of losing progress because of crashing, I've had to reduce graphical settings in the hope of reducing crashing despite spending thousands on a beast PC which can run this game with max settings. That's why it deserves a negative review. I bet a lot of people put a lot of effort in to making this game and I bet one or two a**holes forced the release before it was ready for reasons that are anti-consumer. I estimate I've played 10 hours and crashed 25 times. My PC is fast, extremely stable, runs cool, is up to date with no beta drivers.  Play this game.  If and when they fix it.",

The one thing i can praise the devs for is the combat system which feels waaaay better than the one in Dark Souls, im not really a fan of the armor and weapon design, if someone digs 100% fantasy design which would more than likely never work in real life then thats the game to look out for. Onto the graphics, the game looks aesthetically pleasing with well designed locations and great attention to detail, the places ive been to actually feel like they have been abandoned just a few moments ago.   Positives: +Satisfying combat +Great atmosphere although could've been better +Their XP system is a nice addition (the more you kill the more XP you get, untill you go back to a checkpoint which works like a bonfire, then the multiplier resets) +Pleasing graphics +Really well designed locations +Soundtrack, although might sound a bit generic, works great.  Negatives:  -Overdesigned weapons and armor -Interface could've been improved in many ways. -Pretty linear -Voice acting is rather poor -So is lipsync and the gestures -Inventory window looks all nice and dandy, but id prefer it being more useful than looking 'nice'. -Not impressed by the boss fights so far -Not really challenging, at least in the 4 hours of playtime i have.  Summary: If Dark Souls was a genre of its own, then this would be just another game in that genre, its not necessarily a clone but at least a 'heavily' inspired game, its trying to be a Souls game without being one, if that makes any sense.

I completed the game within 12-13 hours as a rogue and spent 6-7 hours messing around on other classes at the beginning of the game, so an average of 30 hours played which nowadays is pretty good for a £30 single player game.

The graphics for this game are amazing the voice acting on the other hand... could use work in places, the combat felt very well polished with a decent control layout and the NPCs behaviour felt really well done.

There is a decent amount of mix and match with armor to stay at your desired weight level.  Unfortunately it is pretty short. I've got 14.3 hours on it and I have beaten it. My actual play time is only 12h59m because - and this is the worst part by far - crashing. It's ridiculous how often this game crashes. There is some optimization issues present when booting up and every once in a while when loading between worlds/zones there will be some framerate drops.  Lastly I just want to point out that this is not Dark Souls; it is much easier. As long as you do not go exploring areas that you are not ready for (Catacombs before closing the Portal) you will not experience any difficulty at all. I've heard and read that playing the rogue (as a rogue) makes the game a decent challenge but I feel that each class should present their own challenges which they do not.   Overall though I think it is a decent start for the studio and hopefully a long line of Dark Souls hopefulls. If you come in expecting a 10/10 Dark Souls clone you are going to be severely disappointed. If you come in with the mind set that this could be an enjoyable experience that takes many elements from a game the devs love then I think you'll be satisfied.",

            "review_text": "A game inspired in mechanics by the Souls-series, a couple of nice features and a more mainstream approach to story and exposition.  LotF mostly plays like Dark Souls. You've got classes of melee weapons that you can either one-hand with a shield or two-hand for more damage. You can parry enemy attacks, block them or dodge out of the way. It also has a couple of features that ended up in DS3, like paired weapons, where you wield one in each hand when two-handing, and charged heavy attacks. You explore dark fantasy locations like castles, tombs and hellish realms, mowing down enemies, looting treasure and killing bosses. Although progression is mostly linear you'll soon find that most environments interconnect and you'll end up reaching blocked out areas of the early game and opening shortcuts. The story is somewhat short, taking around ~20 hours if you go about it at your leisure. Once you beat the game you can start new game plus which offers harder enemies and better loot. There is no multiplayer like in the Souls-series. It has an intersting spin on 'currency'. Like DS you earn XP that you can either use to level up and upgrade weapons or you can keep on yourself to boost your item find, with the risk of losing it upon death.  Overall the game is a good attempt at a Souls-like. It wears its inspiration at its sleeve. You may feel it is easier than the Souls-games. Combat-wise it's not, though I personally don't find DS hard either, both games require patience to progress but you never feel lost in LotF, you always have a sense of direction and there are almost no points where you need to wiki it.  As I said at the start of the review, it's has a mainstream approach to story telling, exposition and pacing, done through dialogs with NPCs and recovered audio logs, with Souls-like combat and exploring in between. On the other hand said story is cookie-cutter dark phantasy writing, men fighting against demons, sent by a vengeful god and the expected twist near the end. You won't cringe but won't be search Youtube for lore videos either.  Surely worth the asking price on a sale. I got it for ~12.5€ and don't regret it. ",

However in Lords of the Fallen you shield rush your way through which is actually more awesome than the Dark Souls kick.   The game has many similarities that's true - but did introduce new ideas and concepts, however it seems that the gaming community might have expected more Dark Souls (an excellent game) but got Lords of the Fallen (a great game) and thus saw Lords in a negative light.   Things I loved:  Running through enemies with your shield up. Jumping attacks - all the time. Using giant weapons nearly constantly (something I didn't tend to do in Dark Souls) The art style. Some of the more unique looking enemies. Most of the boss fights. Being balanced for a single player game - thus allowing you to feel very powerful.

The story in this game wasn't too bad but wasn't really fully explained in my opinion. It felt very open ended when I finished the game but the audio logs that are left around the world that help you discover the story are a very nice touch.

I'm sure some people will say it's a bad game just because FromSoftware didn't make it, but they're wrong. It's a fun experience, unless you don't like dying a lot and have problems timing attacks with precision.  There is a lot of narrative in this game. Since there is no character creation, you just play as Harkyn. Harkyn has conversations with people. So the game doesn't feel as bleak as Dark Souls (keep in mind when I call Dark Souls bleak, that's a good thing, but it doesn't mean Lords of the Fallen is bad, it just feels different), and it's obvious what you are supposed to be doing.

Graphics with everything turned up are absolutely stunning, but demanding. Enemy designs and environs are wonderfully dark, brooding and awesome.   This world is alive with weather, fire, debris, flickering lights and billowing banners. You also will interact with various NPCs that offer a decent amount of interactivity and depth. It has more than just incidental music (although it's mostly just ambient background sound except during important events)... there are trips to a shadowy netherworld which are really quite atmospheric... The voice acting is decent and the sound effects are bone-crushingly appropriate, as well as offering audible cues for various events (such as locking onto enemies, magic regeneration, etc.)   Controls are tight, fluid and easy to use (gamepad!). Occasionally you will have camera issues in tight spaces, but this is pretty standard for games of this type.  The game also constantly rewards you with new equipment and upgrades, which helps keep you interested. This game offers both stick and carrot, challenge and reward.

I'll put it simply, the game's fun, and it looks great, but there's a few things that irritate me and not in the way that Dark Souls irritates you because it's difficult.  This game is difficult because of the choices made in some game mechanics, as well as small bugs that turn into big problems.   One such bug is enemies turning around to instantly face you if you manage to flank them, completely negating the tactic in the first place. I'm talking about the no-animation, teleport-y kind of turning around, allowing them to immediately attack you again without giving you an opening to attack them without being hit yourself.  It's also too easy to get stunlocked to death by groups of enemies. Sure, it's more 'realistic' if one knock to the ground can immediately mean your death due to multiple enemies being able to still attack/hurt you when you're in a helpless position, but it's not at all fun, or indeed fair. If you die in Dark Souls, you know it's your fault, and you know what you can do to prevent it from happening next time. Further to the point, if you get swarmed by a group, your first instinct would be to retreat and take them on in a more tactical sense, right? In LotF it only takes a nudge for you to get stunlocked enough to suddenly get surrounded, and then you're done for, as there are no i-frames when rolling.  In LotF, you're forced to play tanky and take hits, as going the light route is simply a massive handicap, due to dodging not being as refined as in Dark Souls. So a lot of the time it's luck as to whether you're going to win a fight or not, or whether the enemy you're fighting is going to poise straight through your well-timed heavy and land you on your ♥♥♥ for a grizzly death. So a lot of the time you're relying on your health and defense in order to survive such things, and hopefully dole out more damage to them than they can to you.   Despite this, I would recommend LotF, just don't expect to be able to play like you can in Dark Souls, and don't expect the kind of well-crafted mechanics or indeed interesting lore/characters that Dark Souls is known for. Play tanky, get mad when faced with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, have fun when not.",

This is a critical and inexcusable issue, and a product of this cost should not be crashing on most players' PCs. This is something would find in Alpha phase with even a halfway compentent QA or development staff.  2. Product feels half finished. For what contect there is, it feels like half a game. The story is vague and generic. The characters are not even close to flushed out. The world is particularly small. What the player can do is limited. The camera angle and use in third person (the only viewpoint) is terrible at times. Your character's purpose in the world is a little too simple.  I don't like to be completely negative, and there are some good aspects of the game:  1. Even though the game can be difficult, it can be fun at times. The combat, although clumsy, is more or less solid and satisfying. Additionally, although simplistic, character development enhances the 'RPG' aspect of the game, but it seems to cater to the warrior class and playstyle and punishes any other choice.  2. Graphics are up to par for current gen - the gritty art style compliments the use of the various graphic effects employed. Sound effects are well done.  Overall, I would only recommend the game if the developers patch the game properly and sell it for about half the price. It's not a half bad game, but not worth the current cost.",

The first playthrough was fun, did a rogue one as well up till third boss but then continued on my cleric.  Was an epic game, I lvled all the way up to 84 in the first run, found almost everything there is to find except 1 sword(core, didn't need it) and 2 armor pieces(the statue things, using Tor).   Recently started NG+ and was thinking at least I'll get attribute points from chests where I already found the sword/armor from. But nope, got the same swords/armor as i did last run through from most of the chests. SOME armor chests gave energy or magic resist rune insted which I have too many of already and don't need. So after the second boss on NG+ I have to call it a gg. Lvling up after this point 86 is just mindnumbing and pointless, still wont make you that much stronger. Oh and the weapon aquireing progression through out the game is stupidly done. Any normal game you expect to find better weps as you progress, But I found 1 endgame axe very very early, then almost at the end of the game after finding loads of crap weapons i found an even better one(Last Will) that made anything after that useless again, from the second to last normal enemy before the last boss in the game I found a slightly better one(peacemaker) But at this point I didn't feel like running back and slotting it to just finish the last boss. All in all the game was very fun, but the weapons were so extreamly uneven in dmg they really just look cool but offer close to nothing.",

This isn't a fair expectation or comparison, FROM has had 3 games now to perfect their formula and Demon Souls pales in comparison to 1 and 2 while still being great.  This is the case with Lords of the Fallen, a highly enjoyable ARPG to fill the void between DSII's DLC release and Bloodborne in February. Lords manages to have a few unique mechanics that sets it apart from other ARPGs. One mechanic I really enjoyed was the kill streak mechanic, meaning the more enemies you killed without 'healing' at a checkpoint you got more exp up to a 2x multiplier. This rewards patient and careful play and can really rack up exp quickly.  There are some technical issues currently but they are working on it and have already released one patch to address this and in the future I doubt there will be issues. The combat is enjoyable and while some say much slower than souls, I would say it's about equal if you have light armor and possibly medium with a fast weapon such as a staff.   I would say in a nutshell, it's worth the $50 and I am having a blast.",

I was hoping that if I finished the Story it would surprise me but I decided to make the review even before that.  And why? Because this game is not good. Period.

It's not worth the price. And I'll probably won't purchase other CI titles.  Some reasons that I don't recommend this game (Warning: Spoiler Alert)  - I lost the count of how many time I was holding the defense button with the shield selected, facing my opponent and with full action bar and, even with all these things right, I ended up receiving damage from my enemies and dying.   - When you're using the gauntlet you can shoot at an enemy holding a huge shield that covers all his body and he'll take damage anyway.   - At the same time, you'll face some archers that will shoot fire arrows at you and, even holding a shield the whole time, you'll take fire damage.   - The enemies (archers specially) can see you from far away and they'll hit you for sure. No matter how far you are.   What else do I have noticed?   The game crashes sometimes.  * Do I have anything good about this game?  Only that the graphics are impressive. But, what good is having great graphics if the game does not work right?  If you have any interest in this game, wait for a huge promotion. That's my advice.  ",

            "review_text": "I'm just going to be open right here - I LOVE this game.  I've just beaten it for the first time and I'm going to beat it agaIn and then again in NG+ and NG++.   So what's so good about it? Well, a lot of people compare it to Dark Souls. And in some ways it's similar. It does have the same weighty combat system, where you have to commit to each and every one of your attacks, that have lengthy animations and can not be interrupted mid-swing by the player; hits received, however, will stop your attack. You need to know the attack patterns of all enemies you encounter to survive in the first half of the game, looking for opportunities to strike without losing precious HP.  HP in this game can be restored in 3 ways - by a trinket called Life Leech that I personally only got in the later part of the game, that gives you HP for every monster you kill; by casting a Prayer spell, that acts as a decoy for your enemies and also regenerates a little bit of your health; and, most efficiently, by drinking health potions. Your supply of potions is limited and can only be restored by using a Shard - a checkpoint, essentially - or by dying.   This works really well with another system in place - the XP modifier. The more monsters you kill without using a checkpoint or dying, the more XP you get for each consequent kill, up to 2.0 times more XP for kill. This is very handy, but forces you to refrain from healing and restocking at checkpoints for longer and longer. The game's progress still can be saved at a checkpoint without losing the modifier, but that will not restock your potions and health. It is also said that the more XP you have 'banked' - kept unspent with a risk of losing it - the better loot you can get.   This all makes for a thrilling experience, where your stakes are high, and combat feels important, as every monster you meet has a good chance of killing you.  That said, the feeling only lasts throughtout the first half of the game.  Unfortunately, as you grow stronger, especially if you min-max the ♥♥♥♥ out of your character the way I did it, the fights get easier and easier. In the beginning bossfights took tries and tries to win, and even ordinary monsters had me respawning time after time. By the time I entered the Rhogar Realm for the first time, after, apparently before my time, killing the Rhogar Lord the Champion (I've killed him 4th, later discovering that he should've been the 5th boss to die), I felt immensely powerful. I still could be killed, don't get me wrong, and I died quite a few times when I goofed up, but most of the fights came to 'Bash-Leap-Dodge-Repeat', with some enemies often dying from one heavy attack after being bashed in the face with a Tower Shield.   Boss fights, while each having their own mechanics and even bonus difficulty conditions rewarded with special loot, got easier. 5th and 6th bosses I've met I've killed in 2 minutes and 50 seconds respectively. Last two bosses took me two tries each, in contrast with the 3rd boss that took 6.   The game also feels short. It took me 14 hours to beat it for the first time, and the ending certainly feels a bit abrupt, and not much is explained to you, definitely setting the players up for a sequel.   Overall, Lords of the Fallen has very solid mechanics, absolitely GORGEOUS look to it, wonderful aesthetic and atmosphere, but feels like the developers ran out of steam in the second half of the game, quickly wrapping it up with whatever good ideas they still had. It's a great experience, yet short, and it definitely could use some more difficulty in the end.",

The design is kind of power fantasy, you look like a spiky tank most of the time, and the enemies are grotesque. The combat is clunky, albeit realistic. It focuses on tactical blocking, evading and timing of your hits, and the heavy weapons WILL feel heavy (some of them need two hands to be used, regardless of your strength). It kinda forces you to use all the tools at your disposal, which is a good thing, since it varies the gameplay and forces you to think up strategies on the go. The main story is meh, but you are a criminal and you can totally mess up humanity if you chose one of the three possible endings, so in the end it's fine by my standards.",

A game having so many negative reviews usually pushes it down the list a bit. I gave it a go and it was okay but not great, but sometimes you have to stick at it and not get frustrated and by the time I got to the first boss I was really getting into it.  What I've learnt is that the standard warrior tank class sucks because it's slow and boring to play. For my second game I rolled a rogue and the game was suddenly so much better. It's a much faster and slicker way to play the game. Also you need to get as much xp as possible gathered up early on as it makes things a little easier especially as a rogue. You are going to need play it for a while to settle in then start again when you know what you're doing so you have less chance of dying so you can build xp up.  Some say this game is like Dark Souls and some say not. After completing Dark Souls 3 I think they are the same type of game and I would make comparisons between the two. I didnt really play Dark Souls 1 &amp; 2 so much though.  I feel a bit for the devs of this game with all negativity surrounding it because it's actually very good and very well done.  Anyway, in my opinion this game is definitely worth playing. The graphics are great, the fights are satisfying, the enimies have a great look and design, there is plenty to do and the boss fights are good.   To improve things I'd like to see things explained a bit better like a training mode or something that goes a bit deeper than the tutorial at the very start. Also, another couple of classes to choose from would be great as I honestly think the fun drops drastically playing anything other than the rogue.",

Otherwise, I found the game to be quite entertaining. It has a small world, yes, but it's filled to the tip, and you'll be backtracking a lot, since some areas open only later in the game. The design is kind of power fantasy, you look like a spiky tank most of the time, and the enemies are grotesque. The combat is clunky, albeit realistic. It focuses on tactical blocking, evading and timing of your hits, and the heavy weapons WILL feel heavy (some of them need two hands to be used, regardless of your strength). It kinda forces you to use all the tools at your disposal, which is a good thing, since it varies the gameplay and forces you to think up strategies on the go. The main story is meh, but you are a criminal and you can totally mess up humanity if you chose one of the three possible endings, so in the end it's fine by my standards.",

AND NEVER BUY THIS GAME WITHOUT A DECENT STEAM DISCOUNT!  PROS :  -good graphics. waay better than the souls games ( other than bloodborne ofc), - Great melee combat, more realistic version of souls melee. with actual weight behind attacks  - great character design  -well designed levels  -Great armor and weapon design  CONS :  -WORTHLESS NEW game +!!!! AND THIS IS THE WORST OFFENCE. ONLY 1 new armor set in new game + Just ONE! ( if you guys find more equipment pls tell me. I for one cant find any ) -no gameplay outside of the main story. No exploration. -Flavour text makes no sense, I got a legendary sword that gets stronger with each kill and a weapon from another world.... both of them deals half as much damage as the weapon you get from frkn palace guards in the late game that in the lore , couldnt even kill 1 rhogar lord! but they wield weapons 3 times stronger!!! WTF -SPOILER !!! ......A certain point in the game sets it up so that you get to choose sides, but you actualy dont! Near the end of the game you find out that your true enemy is someone else from the 'god' you are supposed to kill. and instead of being given the choice whether to belive him or not harken belives him just like that! and procedes to fight against the entire human army! How does he know that the ghostly figure of his dead friend is not an illusion?  -Plot is barely explained. as detailed by my rant below  -World map size is small not even half of dark souls 1 - game length is short. I only got to 20 hours because I forced myself to get the secret weapons of the bosses. which by the way are all useless as they rarely deal more damage than the weapons you get before facing them. - skills are there but barely needed for actual combat. I went warior but never and I mean NEVER needed to use my skills other than for solving an ocational puzzle. I got them just for the sake of being able to enjoy the warior class but I could and normaly dont use them anyway. they could have given skills more importance or impact in the game. -weapons and armor are recolored and reused. at first you Apreciate the good looks of equipment. then you realize that the late game version is a recolored version of that same armor. hell even the kinks and scratches are in the same place! WTF   Long Rant version : -Bought the game on sale and went in knowing that it is a subpar dark souls. and despite that I enjoyed the game, that is untill I got to new game + Frgn new game plus barely has anything + about it. only I found only 1 new armor set! WTF Kind of new game + is that? Oh and the story is even more vague than Dark Souls. Why is Harken a prissoner? What the hell was the opening scene about? What was the hammer that he got in the opening cutscene? Why did the final boss turn into that? And the world map is barely as big as half of the Dark souls original map. Probablt only as big as Anor Londo + sens fortress + Seaths castle. And though the armors in the game do look cool the problem with them is that the late game armor is nothing more than a recolored version of earlier armor pieces. And the item descriptions are fckn dissapointing. You get a legendary weapon of some sort that has half the damage of the weapons you get from the palace soldiers late in the game? wtf . ",

While it does have some systems similar to dark souls, most of them other than the combat itself are more interesetng. It also looks better than any dark souls.  I am only 6.3 hours into this, and I can tell this is a pretty good game. The story doesn't have the depth of the souls series, but at least you get dialoge choices when dealing with other characters. The XP multiplier sustem is awesome, it really makes you be cautious about taking damage and wasting your heal consumables. The crafting system is way deeper than the current iteration of the souls game for sure. I haven't seen enough of it to determine if it's better than the previous souls titles yet.   The combat is also slow like it was in the first dark souls.    All in all, they are different games with different mechanics and systems. The inspiration is undeniable though.  I would recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "A decent 'Dark Souls copy', pretty short story (first/blind run ~15 hours) which involves getting lost a few times. Dying isn't a problem either since there are checkpoints behind almost every corner. The storyline is alright, but not good enough to read as a bed-time story.   Enemy types vary a lot: tower shield sword dudes (oh man I love these guys), tall guys with battle axes, crossbowmen, blind zombie things who freak the ♥♥♥♥ out when you make noise, and midgets who charge at you before you get the chance to see them. These enemies are literally everywhere. But the bosses you encounter are unique and have their own special combat style which is cool.   The graphics are great, but there aren't very many options to choose the game's appearance from. At times my FPS dropped roughly but returned to normal after a few seconds, this was bearable and had little effect on the gameplay itself.   The weapons and armor have amazing details and looks to them, and there are a lot to choose from   because, you know...Fashion Souls  . I personally spent a lot of time to admire all these fine pieces of art along with the scenery I came across. Miracles are alright too, I guess. Unfortunately there's only 3 per class (+prayer which acts the same for all classes).The areas look great and bring a certain atmosphere to them, and thus it is sad that there are just 3 main areas you spend most of your time in. I also spent a few hours being lost in these areas, which became somewhat unpleasant after a while.  I think that's all there is to say. If this game gets a sequel, I'd most likely play it. Even though it doesn't beat Dark Souls in the gameplay or difficulty, but rather in frustration and unforgiveness, it still offers a very enjoyable gaming experience.   EDIT (26.11.2016): Played this game again, this time on a desktop PC. The game is still a bit choppy in certain places, but that's because of the poorly made PC port. This time around I started the game as a warrior, and didn't really get lost since I still remembered where to go for the most part.  The areas, enemies and most of the bosses still made me die plenty of times, but still not as much as during my first playthrough. Not because of the previous experience, but because of the choice of class and 'build'. It's still a pretty and challenging game.",

There are usually checkpoints a short distance before boss fights, so you don't have to spend hours upon hours just fighting your way back to them only to be killed again in 3 seconds. Speaking of bosses, I was able to explore and find a boss that seemed way too hard for my current level - I could barely scratch him. Satisfyingly, with some persistence and a total change of strategy, I wore him down in an epic, edge of seat, half-hour long battle and won the day.  My (fairly minor) gripes so far are a slight lack of enemy variety and that the spells seem a bit limited and shoehorned in.",

            "review_text": "It's hard to recommend this game in its current state. It's an incredibly buggy and unoptimized game. Until the developers make serious strides in fixing these issues, I'd say hold onto your money. This is mainly a consequence of the game's qualities just barely overcoming its shortcomings. When the technical difficulties are thrown into the mix, those qualities have just that much more to contend with.  First, this game is very much in the line of Souls games. The similarities between the two are numerous: no map, tough enemies, nebulous story, a weight-based movement system, and a leveling/checkpoint system very similar to Dark Soul’s bonfire-based system. The similarities don’t end there but this game’s status as a “Souls clone” has been well-established.  With that said, the game does many things well. The art direction, while it has proven to be somewhat divisive, is quite good. While some armor has been recycled, the sets look good and fit the world they inhabit. The animations are fluid. Hitboxes are generally well done. Enemies are far more likely to hit you on the back end of their swings than in any of the Souls game. Whereas in Dark Souls, many encounters could be beaten by simply rolling into enemies, the same cannot be said for Lords of the Fallen. One must think about his rolls and the direction they will take. The weight system is practically a copy-pasted system from Dark Souls—a system I’m much more partial to than the system in Dark Souls 2. On the whole, the game is generally enjoyable to play.   Unfortunately, there are various issues that make it difficult to appreciate the game’s qualities. Technically, the game is prone to crashes, the framerate is atrocious, and bugs run rampant. I won’t spend time much time on the technical issues, though. As for the game, frankly it’s too easy. Most bosses are easily beaten on the first attempt. Enemies aren’t too varied which affords the player enough experience within the first handful of hours to breeze through the rest of the game. The developers try to curb this ease by throwing in, seemingly random, enemies that, while looking like typical enemies, have more health and do a great deal of damage. Entire sections of the game, especially toward the end, feature enemies that do more damage than any boss in the game does while having a substantial amount of health. This is fairly frustrating and inconsistent with the world the game is building. Other issues include the targeting system, which is barely functional. The magic system is poorly implemented. Some spells are either poorly designed (Mimic which obscures your character and the enemy), only function a handful of times (Stab, which misses seemingly a third of the time), or are simply not useful (Prayer). All of these spells also cost a great deal of mana. My faith build (essentially a magic build) could get off maybe 2-3 spells before going OOM. Add in the ridiculous cooldown that all spells have and one can hardly be faulted in wondering why magic exists at all.    I’m going to stop here. The bottom line: the cons outweigh the pros in this offering. Perhaps a few patches from now and a Steam sale later this game might be worth picking up.  ",

Pros This is a more forgiving Dark Souls, well executed art and decent sound work. Control is snappy, overall gameplay feel is good.   Cons Stability was my biggest issue and the one keeping me from playing further. In the first 15 seconds of starting a game I got a black screen lockup I could alt tab out of and restart the game.   Then I had a hard freeze mid swing in combat that I couldnt get out of and was about to hold my power button after about 10 minutes when the game shut and my system accepted all the input id been trying to give it.   **Unfortunately for me, a big part of this game is centered around NOT SAVING. Seriously, how long can you go without dying or using a save crystal, the longer you go the bigger an xp/loot multiplier you build up, if you save/heal up at a save point your multiplier resets.**  My second fatal crash/lockup came about 2 hours into a streak. Lost all of that progress. You know that feel, I know you do.   TLDR: Game with core mechanic tempting the player not to save progress, crashes frequently on current hardware.

Also, the lore and story aren't a big suprise even if quite decent, but it might sounds dull if you grew bored of that sort of, like, regular heroic fantasy with muscles and big boobs. Characters are a bit cliché when not completly blank...  Yet it's not a bad game. Combats are fun and the game does a pretty good job at giving you reason to just go through the corridors. At least if you're a bit curious.  So yeah, i'd recommand it. Not at full price though. I think the game would be better at around 35$ or something.",

The boss fights aren't challenging at all, I would go so far and say some are really boring.  What bugs me the most is the playtime. In Dark Souls, I played 60+ hours on my first playthough. In LOTF, I finished the game after 15 hours. Yes, 15 hours for an ARPG is way too short.   In Dark Souls, you also have multiplayer gameplay, in LOTF you don't.

Pros: + Forgiving checkpoint system + Balanced and fair combat + Nice variety of enemies. + Great graphics. Particle effects of Unreal Engine 4 in full effect here. + Great soundtrack. Reminiscent of Diablo II soundtrack. + Audio logs. A lot better than reading about the world and the voice acting is good as well.  Cons: - Not the best optimized game, but the frame rate is steady. If you must have 60 fps, you'll have to turn down some settings. I'm fine with the 40-50 fps I get. - Story is pretty barebones. That's not why I'm playing this game though. - Camera can get wild with multiple targets in a small space like a hallway.  Conclusion: I have tried to get into the Dark Souls games, and I respect the design of them but I simply can't replay the same content bonfire to bonfire over and over again. This game provides an alternative experience and is the first competitor/clone of the Souls games. I picked this up from ♥♥♥ for $15 and it is well worth the price. If you want to get into Dark Souls but would like to start with an easier (still difficult though) experience than Dark Souls, this is the game for you.",

I would agree Dark Souls is a slightly better game largely due to its' setting, atmosphere, and gear crafting depth. However, Lords of the Fallen is without a doubt a superb action RPG in a fascinating would with epic boss fights!  Secondly, while the game has a reputation for bugs and stability issues, as of patch 1.6 I can tell you I only encountered a handful of very minor glitches. If this concern has held you back from purchasing the game, then worry no longer the game is solid.  Lords of the Fallen is a superior PC gaming experience over Dark Souls. The graphics are nothing short of phenomenal by comparison as they really take advantage of the muscle power of modern PC gaming hardware. Additionally, you can see by the patch history they care enough to fix bugs and stability issues, and not leave PC gamers with year old bugs (*cough* Dark Souls 2 durability *cough*).  I'm hoping we'll see a Lords of the Fallen 2 complete with multiplayer in the near future!",

I'll say right off the bat that this is a Dark Souls 2 clone. I say two specifically because this feels much more similar to the sequel than the original (or Demons'). Nearly all your enemies are humanoids, for example.   It plays a lot better than Dark Souls 2 though. No enemies pivoting on the spot mid swing to auto-track you, all the hitboxes seem tight and what you expect. Also it looks a shed load prettier for what that's worth.  The conversation system is a bit pointless, and I was a bit dissapointed in the weapon upgrading system. You can slot gems into your gear for things like +4 dmg or +10 melee protection. But most weapons can only take 1 or 2 runes, so you never really feel like your changing anything dramatically. You won't get that Dark Souls feeling of taking a crappy starting weapon and upgrading it to +10. Though you can freely swap runes in and out as you wish so it's a bit more fluid.   If you're looking for more Dark Souls then give this a shot. It's a straight up clone with a fresh coat of paint. In comparison to the other games like this I'd say this comes in somewhere inbetween Demons and DS2 in terms of quality.  Worth a punt, especially if you see it on sale.",

GRAPHICS I love the visuals and i am surprised that why most reveiwers dont use this game to benchmark GPUS. When i bought this game I was running it on a r9 290x @ 1080p, Recently i upgraded to a 980ti and am now running the game uber smooth at 1600p. I must say this game is prolly the best looking RPG right now, It looks better than witcher III which is saying something.  Gameplay. Its nowhere as difficult as darksouls ( i spent around 400 hours in dark souls 1 on PS3) And that is a good thing, I like how the world is interconnected, I do wish they had a ranged specifc class system which would have made the game much for fun , There are basically 3 main classes which can further be merged into more classes. All play the same it depends on your style. The game isnt very long which is a dud. It should have been longer and left me with a feeling of wanting more, the DLC they added wasnt all that fun tbh I was way too op for it.  Sound. Not much of a sound nerd but i like how this game sounds :)  so if u r a action rpg fan who loves to play pretty games and if u like the artstyle of darksiders and if you think darksouls was too difficult... get this game!!!

Enviroment and level design are one of my favourite things in the game. I got lost sometimes, which is also good for me. Some enemies require cheezy strategies at first until: a) you git gud and do it normal way b)you're so op that they shatter under your gaze alone. Opponents very rarely use cheese strategies, only like once or twice in the game. Overall i can give it 8.5/10 NG alone with +/- 0.5 depending on the part of the game.",

Lords of the Fallen have good mouse and keyboard controls! I haven't played Dark Souls because I don't have controller, don't like the controller and controls for mouse and keyboard are horror (I was fighting with controls in Dark Souls since they didn't let me fight the monsters).   I thought after seeing so many videos that I have enough patience for this combat type - I was so wrong! First 4 to 6 hours I spent only learning how to be patient and careful. It was infuriating! Once I settle that down, only then I started to learn how to play Lords of The Fallen. Every weapon is a bit different and it is very punishing if not used properly. This is one of those games where the main focus is on playing again and again. There is no way around it. This is not the bad thing - on contrary! It is done in such way where player learns from his mistakes and tries again thus improving himself. Pure Warrior, Cleric and Rogue give quite diverse playtyle and I would advise anyone to start with pure aproach before making hybrids (my first save was hybrid and it is wrong).  I encountered few crashes. On 16 hours I had like 6 crashes. I have everything on High except model detail on Very High but I think I should bring that back on High. Visually, game looks very polished. There are no blank unfinished spaces. Everything is designed to feel like finished game (this is the reference to Dark Souls where many areas feel barren and unfinished). Animations are quite good. Harkyn really moves like a human - he is not wooden imitation of a human motions. I am very pleased to see that a side from first initial intro, all cutscenes are ingame engine realtime rendering. The only thing I don't like in those is when upon killing a warden, Harkyn has no helmet for the duration of cutscene (they could make animation where he lifts his helmet and then rest of cutscene continues as usual.  Gameplay, well as someone who could not play Dark Souls because of controls, I really enjoyed this game so far. In long time there was no game that glued me for screen. There is something in improving yourself and trying things. On top of that, even though simplified, character builder is very intuitive and gives enough info what will happen. One exception is last 4th spell where it states only Faith requirement but it also require 5 points spent in spells as another requirement.",

There are 0 likeable or relatable characters, period. The main man is built like a brick shithouse with a past obtusely obscured, has no discernable motive in any way and is acting for other characters whose motives are nebulous and poorly explained at best. The world is littered with audio notes that serve to fill in the backstory, but since the game wants to try and avoid having an ENTIRELY linear progression, trying to use those notes to learn the history of the world is tedious and scrambled. The dialogue options all feel entirely without consequence. The game has a horrible fascination with giving zero direction to the player except a one sentence task and that's ultimately what killed my enjoyment. I got to an area, realised that I was being given no direction (and in certain cases outright lied to about my direction or given conflicting information by characters and questlog) and put down my controller. After 13 hours I realised exactly how little fun I'd had at all. It's such a shame, as well. The game is graphically beautiful, the aesthetic of the character design and world design is incredibly cohesive and often remarkable. The new twists that LotF brings to standard RPG elements serve it well and are pretty damn unique. It's let down by how little I care about anyone and anything in the world, how boring a lot of the combat and exploration can be and how little the developers care about directing a player through their world.  I'd recommend picking it up at maybe $5, checking it out and seeing if you get more out of it than I did.",

The game starts off somewhat difficult, feeling under-powered, and enemies hit hard; and areas that seem gated by your level to keep you from going in that direction until you're ready (catacombs early on really showed me how weak I was).  However, it get's easier pretty early on as well. I started play as a cleric type, and once I had enough points into the Daze spell, things just got a little too easy, especially bosses. Dying became irrelevant , as fidning potions to recover your ghost after death were plentiful, as well as attribute/spell point shards to increase your stats even more. I think I finished with 20 VIT, 30 Faith, and 20 End, wearing the Fallen armor set and wielding a massive club, making end game bosses a joke.  New Game + was a pleasant suprise, as I found the enemies scaled very well to it, though the bosses were still pretty simple. I tried being a rogue for NG+, but with the amount of experience needed for a single attribute point becoming increasingly expensive, I relied mostly on those attribute/spell point shards to boost my stats.  The story telling was done in a way that I like, picking up audio notes to listen to the lore as I fought, instead of finding a note and having to read it to take away from the action. The story, overall, was pretty decent in my opinion, and with the audio notes found, it gives you a deeper understanding of the world and just what it is that has happened/is happening. The one part of the lore I would like to see expanded upon is the main character, Harkyn. I don't know what sins or crimes he has committed in the past, but his face, if one could understand it, tells the tale. The only thing I can gather is that he was a soldier, as the captain you meet in the game knows Harkyn, and vice-versa.  Decent story, solid mechanics, and fun gameplay; I recommend this for anyone who is a, 'Souls,' fan, though don't look for an exact clone, but a game that took many elements from the series and expanded upon them in it's own way.",

The game play is very similar, and if you own a controller and have played dark souls you'll feel right at home. You gain experience from each enemy which can either be gambled or stored, and monsters only seem to respawn if you die, so it will balance earlier.  The beginning of the game is very much a tutorial, and it does (thankfully) get a little more difficult as you progress through the story (for me one of the very positive aspects).  You also get challenge portals linked to lords. Kill a lord, and then go into the challenge portal, survive and you get loot. The more you have of these, and the more risks you take, the better you will do in the game.  The balance of the game is set for people who will use the Checkpoint system, so you may find it either too difficult, or too easy if you circumvent it.  The experience is engaging, and quite addictive.  Positives:     Great aesthetic     Challenging     Good story/Strong story telling     Rewarding feeling (loot / challenges / accomplishments)     Large levels  Negatives:     There are frame rate issues, and stuttering. Sometimes it will freeze for 1 second or so (seems related to asset loading)     Crashes (I've only had two and they seem to be related to alt+tab) - Alt+tab == crash.     Mixed balance - some enemies are too easy, some are too tough (for no apparent reason - though this may be related to an area you shouldn't yet be in.)  ",

            "review_text": "Review on Lords of the Fallen:  After finishing Lords of The Fallen, it gave me a 'Mass Effect 3' ending disappointment. The game is Overall Pretty Good, though the back-stab is rather iffy. but I swear the amount of bugs I went through really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off which I will list down there later.  Positive points: 1. Just as current day gamers categorize Rogue-Like and Rogue-Lite, I agree with other reviewers out there that this is Dark-Souls-Lite. The game is very similiar to Dark Souls but the game was designed for you to take hits even if you choose the rogue agility class. Other classes will take damage from the beginning of the game until the end, but for the rouge, you have to take some damage at the start of the game to kill enemies and get experience to level up. After leveling up to a certain point and obtaining your final magic ability, that is where the fun begins and you can sneak almost every enemy, 'Stab' and back-stab.  2. The weapon timing mechanic is very interesting especially when you dual wield. When you dual-wield, you cannot unleash your combo unless you successfully execute the perfect timing strike two times consecutively, any remaining stamina after that can be used to continue the multi-hit combo if you, once again, successfully execute the perfect timing strike.  3. I've played heavy-weapons as well, and it relies more on timing the strikes or tanking enemy hits to deal a heavy blow. Early on, the perfect timing strike allows you to attack 2 times and dodge roll before having your stamina deplete. Without perfect timing, you may only attack twice and have your stamina depleted, leaving you open to attacks. Also, with this stat called Poise, more Poise means you can take larger hits without getting staggered or falling down. It is a pretty nice way to portray the 'Tanky-Feeling' of Heavy Armor.  4. The stamina/energy recovery is relatively fast compared to Dark Souls/ Dark Souls 2. In my opinion, this makes it a bit more enjoyable. Remember, this means the enemy has the relatively fast regeneration too.  5. The enemies in the game are quite normal and it was easy to figure out their pattern. Boss attack patterns are also easy to figure out cause every attack has a distinct preparation pose. This does not necessarily mean it is easy to beat them, you still have to figure out which attacks do they combo with. Depending which magic class and armor you chose to play with, you have to react accordingly. This makes it fun, it gives me a monster hunter feeling.  [The style reminds me of monster hunter, but why I did not use monster hunter as an example is because in MH, attacks do not consume stamina. In Monster Hunter, you can throw caution to the wind when fighting common mooks, and only fight seriously and learn the pattern of the boss monster. Whereas for Dark Souls and Lords, you have to fight every unit with the seriousness of a Monster Hunter Boss]   6. The Rune crafting is quite interesting, depending on what type of equipment you put the rune in, it provides different stats and different runes do different things too.  Negative Points: 1. Seems to me if you are a rogue and you meet an enemy with a shield, you must bring out your own shield which most likely won't work because you have low poise OR cheese'em with the magic gauntlet of pew pew. This kind of makes me feel like I'm forced to NOT play Rogue   2. Some bosses and units are too easy to cheese with the gauntlet, I experiment 'the cheese' for a few shots and proceed to fight normally, when the boss changes style I experiment again to test if it can be 'cheese-ed' and continue to fight as usual.  3. The walls will make your camera get screwed up. When you run into a wall, chances are that your camera will zoom into your face and you cannot see the enemy. Another possibility is that you get to look inside the wall and nothing else. Therefore, besides the enemies in front of you, you have to remember, walls are you enemies too. It would have been nice if they would make the walls transparent when you go too close to the walls and zoom out but hey, maybe it was intentional to make walls your enemies too.  4. The choices you make in game don't really matter which makes me feel like I should just do the main quest and nothing else if I ever play the game from start again. Just slight changes for the end, which gave me a 'Mass Effect 3' ending disappointment, as said on the top.  5. Sometimes when you attack, you clip through the enemy and all you see are their undergarments (loin cloth) or armor. Screwing your camera up in the process, leaving you vulnerable. Also, when this happens, 50% of the time, your damage will not register.  6. The magical illusions are flawed. Not 'Prayer', other skills like the Rogue's 'Stab': occasionally the enemy will register that 'Stabs' illusion is a target-able unit like all Magic Classes 'Prayer' and proceed to attack that illusion. It is an advantage to the player but that is not suppose to happen.  7. I may have said that the Rune Crafting is interesting but there is too few variety of runes. Which make it quite dull at the same time.  [BUGS] Before Patch 1.4: 1. Subtitle not disappearing if you change area when the subtitles are present; 2. Death but not death: black screen never fades back into game except when i pause, happens when you fall into a death pit but there are stones that block your way down to the bottom which make you take damage but so happens that part of the pit is also the death line; 3. Units flying into the sky during death animation and stays in the air (this one is ok, just funny); 4. Run to checkpoint with enemy chasing, checkpoint disabled animation did not proc, kill enemies; checkpoint cannot proc reactivation animation; checkpoint forever disabled; 5. Even after lowering graphic setting, I can't move my character as soon as the screen fades in. In two ways, holding down the button cause I knew there are units there, disabled my WASD. (yes im playing with keyboard) and another way is that when I see the screen fade in, I press any of the WASD key, he does this little shuffle to that direction and barely even moves an inch. (Note: I had 3 enemies in front of me and i'm a rogue)[no movement means death] 6. The dodge invulnerability time is odd, [for the early part of the game i tried using it, after that I just didnt bother using the invul time anymore] sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't; some times you get invul at the end of dodge, sometimes i get hit at the end of dodge, doesn't make sense to me. In addition to that, the enemies' weapon hit box seemed irregular to me. 7. Whether this is a bug or not, whenever a rouge uses the ability Mimic, the spirit will block your vision and you cannot see what's in front of you most of the time, this is the worst skill I have ever used if this is not a bug.  Conclusion: I enjoyed playing this game, but the bugs of the game really got on my nerves. There are times I found the game ridiculous, there are times I found the game interesting and almost genius. Thus, the score is given below.  Lowest I give the game : 6 .5/10 Highest I give the game: 8.0/10  Overall I give Lords of the Fallen: 7.0/10.",

The inital effort of getting this game to work has turned me off it but the gameplay is quite good!  Things to note: - Nice looking game - Combat feels heavy and patience in combat pays off - Quite a lot of items and weapons, there's varity - The magic was fun to use, there's quite a few different types in the game - Bosses seem to take forever to die, requires a patient gamer. Is not the same 'feeling' as a Dark Souls boss! Maybe I'm rubbish though. - May have been inspired by Dark Souls but it really isn't the same, it's different enough to stand on its own - This is definitely a game worth getting in the sales, I would not buy it at full price knowing what I know now.",

            "review_text": "I was told this game is 'Dark Souls done wrong'. I had no problem with that, I wanted to like it for what it offers on it's own. I didn't think it was fair to make the comparsion, despite the game clearly wanting to aim for the solid 2nd best position, trying to ride the fame and hype of a genre another game bringed back, lives and profits from in a quite dominant position. And I said, I'm okay with that, it can be a great game because what's inside is what matters the most, not the franchise name burnt on it's box. And still, Lords of the Fallen is just B- in everything on it's own, compared to no other game. You just feel in every moment of it.   I picked it up for 3,99 so no regrets here, mainly because I wanted a taste of what Dark Souls games are like and honestly it's only good for that. I haven't played any DS games, but I'm certain they must be better than this. It is a game that is never going to be finished (by me, it's a complete game tho), so overall I still consider it a waste if you buy this game for itself. I bought it for a taste of the DS experience, and it lasted 7 hours, and I feel like this isn't the way to make that work right. With no experience about the DS titles, I know THIS isn't the way to do it right.  For this reason I cannot honestly recommend it.  The game known as 'poor man's dark souls'. And I bought it to be that, so can't say I was disappointed with what I got, but the 'poor man's dark souls' title speaks for itself. It wants to be something, but fails so, and has nothing else on it's own.  1. The combat is incredibly boring. You could say it is supposed to be tactical, but reality is that you have to use a few spells you get with every class, and it's almost always the solution. Or you can look at each other with both shields up and everyone bunkering down for 5 to 10 minutes. With a random filler enemy. Shielded opponent? Whatever class you pick you can either go a) invisible to backstab b) slow down time and walk around c) just send a firey clone of yourself in it's face to explode. You can do workarounds, try interesting special moves with all the weapons, but it gets repetitive incredibly fast due to..  2. the lack of cretivity. And this applies to EVERY aspect of the game. I think I have met about 4 types of opponents in the 6,6 hours I spent in Lords of the Fallen. Random 'ork guy' with a shield, without a shield, jumping dog type that can breathe unblockable stuff, and crossbow guy. And variations of these, smaller, bigger, sometimes poison, sometimes fire, sometimes thin wizardey sometimes fat guardey, sometimes 4 legs sometimes none. But mechanically there is barely any difference between them and when a game is built like this, with the 'less is more' in mind, so you have to fight a really small number of enemies compared to other similar games, the lack of creativity really shows. Same goes for the enviroment, it wants to be Dark Souls gothic so desperately, has a great looking engine to do so, but it just ends up being Darksiders with more blur. With the exception of the very few vistas (I think I've came across 2 under this ~7ish hours) and more unique rooms such as the temple hall at the first boss, it's always the same. Fortress, garden, cave, prison, royality rooms, even a different dimension, battle hardened or brand new, ALL looks the same. Not just the atmosphere, but the structural layouts, construction style, even the size of the bricks walls are mostly made of, everything is the same everywhere, and it gets boring. It wants to be Dark Souls, but every new room here is just like the one you came from instead of being something exciting, and outside areas are the same with the exception of not having a ceiling. And the bosses, oh the bosses. As interesting as they seem to be on first sight, you'll realize there is barely any challange there because they are SO BASIC mechanically that only your lack of patience can get you killed. All of them are like they exist in slow motion only, and just a bigger variant of some basic enemy with one or two extra spells and a really boring looks. Have you seen the first DS3 boss, the knight transforming to that darkness-snake thing? That alone has more creative design than everything and anything added together in this game.  If you are still interested, you should know that it is a solid PC version, no fps, crash or anything else issues happend. It's not particularly demanding, you should be fine somewhat above the minimum requirements to play it on nearly maxed out settings with good speed.",

I walked away from this game after only and hour becuase I could not believe how unbelievably bad it was. Sloppy controls mixed with frustrating button layouts. the first two bosses were (if you can even call them that) stupidly easy, and then a bit later on I happen across a spider that kills me in two hits from across the room, through my shield. That was so jarring and I felt ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and annoyed. I tried to fight this spider a few more times and just couldnt kill it and I figured I wasnt supposed to be there. So I moved on from that disaster onto the next area were I find this giant knight with a tower shield who I spend a solid 2 minutes trying to circle around to get an opening and I couldnt, the area was to narrow or he was to ....fast....a tower shield heavy armor wielding knight was to fast to get behind. I decide since I am also a tank class I will try to trade blows, this gets me one shotted. This is a problem, one minute I am recking everything and the next I get one shot. There doesnt seem to be much of a difficulty curve because at least in the first 2 hours was everywere. This game is seriously boring with bad design choices, horrible enemy placement and lackluster animations. I hear it has nice graphics but it has O.K graphics even on ultra. The frames for it being ultra are lower then it should be signaling bad optimization but Im not an expert on that so I wont go further with that complaint. Over all I cant recommend this game to a real souls fan. Its been described as chunky souls but its more then that, its soulless souls too. Get it to try for yourself if you have to get it out of your system but otherwise just wait for DS3. Watch a Lets Play :P I here dsp is halariously fun to watch due to his horrible gameplay.

Obviously, each rig will preform differently and many people have had no issues with the game. However, I'd advise giving this a miss and save yourself from the possability of wasting money.   Aside from the bugs and performace, the game is pretty decent. To save some explination of the combat, it's basically Dark Souls but worse. My main quarral is the movement speed of the character. It seems you can't have a truely quick and agile character in this game. Your options are limited to slow, slower and very slow. When I talk of the speed of the character, I speak mainly of his attack speed. When it comes to rolling, jumping and running the speed is fine for each 'option'.   I find the armour the characters wear to be ridiculous. The chest pieces and gauntlets seem fine, but everything else seems to be overly large, especially the armour in the shoulder area. There's a few scenes where men in armour are very close to one another and they noticeably clip through one other.  The story of the game seemed interseting, I was however not able to complete it due to extremely bipolar framerates, making combat nearly impossible.  Thankfully, I only lost $22 CAD to this.",

I can't even get from one check point to the next because it keeps crashing, and I have to keep going through the same section hoping to make it to the next check point before it crashes, but I can't. Sometimes it crashes before the start up movies even start now.

            "review_text": "At first sight this game seems impressive, coming from Dark Souls you buy this because you want the challenge, and you want another game that can give you what Dark Souls gave you. This game is not that.  If anything this should be played before Dark Souls as a kind of initiation because if you've played and completed Dark Souls, even the recent (easier than the original) Dark Souls II, this game isn't going to give you a challenge.  The Bosses of Lords of the Fallen aren't so much as difficult as they are annoying, they are predictable and easy to figure out, and the difficulty came from the size of their health pools. In fact, the majority of bosses, even the ones that at first sight seemed difficult, I killed on the first attempt. Sure, I could say this skill and patience came from the horror of Dark Souls, but in all honesty, I don't think it did. Stand around for a couple of minutes and dodge a bosses attacks and you'll be able to do it with your eyes closed.  Continuing on, the game has been released for over a week now, and still no official fix for the constant crashes I'm experiencing. I'm currently writing this review after several crashes in the final bosses intro (that takes a hell of a long time, btw). I recommend waiting for a fix for the crashes because they are a real problem in allowing you to progress with the game.  The story is bland, and the scenery is bland. Throughout the entire game I haven't stopped for a moment to admire my surroundings, everything is extremely similar, it feels like one big area. Maybe that's what they were aiming for with the game.. for you to feel like you're stuck in such a small area as the Rhogar attack, but it's a bad design decision if so, because no one will remember this game in a few years because of that fact.  The writing feels so weird, it's like the entire game is made of cheesy lines that make you want to impale yourself on your character's badass weapon (which is probably the biggest plus of this game). It's so uninteresting, the voice acting feels so forced, most of the time I feel like I'm actually listening to a voice actor and not the character, but completely destroys immersion.  It's sad, honestly. I was so hyped for this game, 'Woohoo, more potential Dark Souls', but that's all it was, potential Dark Souls. I hate to make the comparison, but if they're expecting me not to when it's what the majority of people that buy this game want, then they've made the wrong game.  Last points, If you want a game that's easier than Dark Souls, don't bother. Don't even bother playing something easier, the whole reason Dark Souls is so appealing is because of how it makes you feel after the 100 boss attempts before success. You feel so HIGH and ENERGETIC after beating such a difficult enemy. Keep on with Dark Souls and push yourself, you will succeed and you will feel good about it. Play this and you might feel like you have a little bit of a sugar rush sometimes, but thats about it.  Finished the game in just over 11 hours. Last boss seemed pretty challenging at first, but it was just my weapon choice.",

Lords of the Fallen is not Dark Souls. The same way 'Shadow of Mordor' is not Assassins Creed.   For me it plays like a Cross between Diablo and the Souls series; that is dungeon crawling for loot and smashing bad guys in a array of play styles depending on your weapon. The game play is similar enough for DS fans to become immediately used to with a few extra tweaks to make it interesting.  There are a few things that Lords of the Fallen could have done better like story telling and character animations in cut scenes, but there are some awesome things that it does right.  The atmosphere in the game is great and the graphics are beautiful with moments being nothing short of epic. The combat is forgiving enough to experiment with, while still being fun and engaging and the game has a way of making you feel like a bad ♥♥♥ while still keeping you on your toes. I've read complaints of crashes and glitches, but I have not had any of these yet.  As a long time Dark Souls Fan (300+ hours on DS1 and 170+ hours on DS2) I knew this was a game I'd enjoy. Not because it replaces Dark Souls but because it fits well into the same gaming space as Dark Souls.",

Another thing to appreciate about LoTF is that enemies and bosses have multiple strengths and weaknesses, so there are several approaches to killing them, either by boosting stamina, using combat spells against them, ranged attacks, or different weapon types that can be easily cycles.  This game is far more polished that Dark Souls 1 or 2 from a UI, keyboard + mouse, and graphical standpoint.

Not as peculiar as Dark Souls (that poison-serpant lady was just mmmmmmdifficult without the know-how) The weapons and armor are great designs, each weapon having a different moveset. However, the range is quality is vast, with you picking up some top notch stuff early on, and some lame stuff later, and everything in-between.  Two-handed warrior is the best class. I started as a rogue that was agile and used twin daggers and swords. The difficulty starts out medium, then ramps the ♥♥♥♥ up when you have to fight anything with a shield and can't get around (you'll know exactly when). I re-speced, which you can only do once and need a guide to show you how. Two-handing weapons owns the game in some ways, but , and helps balance some of the cheap hitboxes and the absolutely frustrating camera.  I used 'Deception' magic but read that the 'Brute' or warrior magic is just as good/better. Either way, magic is annoying to use, and this special 'Gauntlet' hand cannon is pointless and unnecessary. The story is only mild-sauce, getting better at the end but mostly fantasy short-hand at this point. Evil things invade our world, you fight the demons here and then in their world, find out human has opened a portal to another realm, make some decisions about mercy or killing. I could storyboard this on a flippin' cocktail napkin.  The sidequests are so-so, and you can lock yourself out if you don't do the dialogue right the first time. NPCs wear cement shoes. My fighting strategy didn't change from hours 5 to 13 when I finished. Kinda wish some more curveballs were thrown to make me adapt.  I did enjoy it for the most part, because I just wanted more Dark Souls style combat.  It never exceeds Dark Souls in any one aspect, but gets close in several like combat and bosses.  No coop or covenants If you like Dark Souls. I recommend this game. 7/10  Dark Souls",

Cons:  -No character customization. - Theres a reason some call this clunky souls , the entire game feels as if its sumberged in oil , it is infact realistic combat and some would make this a pro but honestly I prefer the almost anime level fights I get in the souls series sometimes. -Character looks really wierd if you go for dagger-centric playstyle , this comes back around to the lack of character customization. - Combat feels really weird and unresponsive at times. - Level design is linear as hell. - Bosses fail at sucking you into the atmosphere or even intimidate you.  bugs: - lack of enemy and background audio without being able to fix it , had the entire second stage fully silent except for hits connecting. - boss bugged out and got stuck behind his own shields hitting me through them but not being able to get hit by me. also kept on summoning more shield around him in addition to the bugged ones.  verdict : Do not buy this if your expecting to fill your void after completing a souls game , it simply wont cut it. even worse than DS2 PvE...(worst of the series IMO)  But - if you are new to this genre and you are looking for a more 'casual' game then go for this one .. not saying its easy but its definitely more forgiving and less confusing to a first timer than dark souls .

            "review_text": "tl;dr  This game isn't dark souls. It is a very good game inspired by souls with its own feel.  If you want dark souls, play dark souls.  Most of the negative reviews for this game basically just say that this isn't dark souls so it sucks. Well guess what: this isn't dark souls, it is a game inspired by the soul series with its own story, gameplay and mentallity towards how it should be played. The basic difference between this game and the souls series is that in souls you are able to block all attacks, maneuver around many enemies, and are generally required to play an agile character with little to no armor and no shield to play effectively. Lords of the Fallen allows and encourages the use of heavy armor and shields, while still keeping an agile character viable. Where most see this as a weakness, I see it as this games biggest strength.   This game allows you to play a heavy, strength based character that can barely dodge or an endurance based character that bounces around and gets in quick strikes. It is much more difficult to do the latter, but shouldn't it be? This game allows you to play the way you want and in a sense choose your difficulty based on how you spec your character. The only thing that isn't viable is a magic character, as the magic was just kind of tossed in and is pretty worthless.  The only issue I have had performance wise is a very rare stutter (actually, it is just one mini boss that makes my game stutter when he does a certain attack) and the game crashed on me once. That said, crashes in this type of game are a very big deal, given that you can only save at certain points, but there really is no need to farm or skip checkpoints so the crash was just a minor annoyance to me.",

            "review_text": "I wrote this review, as i progressed through the game.. So each point, is written in real time, as i was experiencing the positives, and negatives.. You'll note that my opinions change over the course.. Its not Souls, but a great attempt!  -Its beautiful. The graphics, environment, characters, weapons/armors. Top notch quality! It claims the enemies have the same rules you do.. Stagger, weight, momentum, etc.. This is blatantly false, and you will notice it in the prologue (this was my biggest issue with the game overall).   Slow swings i can deal with, but the 1h Maces' terrible reach, &amp; overly slow windup (even your 'fast' attack) is painful.. I opted for medium armored Cleric, with the hammer, and shield &amp; Red Magic.. I dropped the hammer asap, and i LOVE hammers! The 1st boss was almost the end of the game for me, as it told you how to swing, dodge, and then puts you up at a boss fight almost immediately.. Frusteration, is not fun for me, nor is trial and error.. Ive beaten all 3 souls games multiple times, and thoroughly enjoyed those.. Never was Frusteration part of it.. It always felt like player error when i lost.. This is alot of fighting the mechanics, and stick and move.. Ill bet 9/10 player will opt to play the heavily armored tank, and trade blows, as it feels like the only way to play..  But its pretty, if your rig can handle it.. The trash mobs are too weak, and the bosses are not fun.. The only redeeming factor, besides the graphics, are all the armor/weapons... WHich is useless, if the game isnt fun to play!  (some of my opinions here changed as i progressed)  *****UPDATE***** Played several more levels, and hours, beat 3 or 4 bosses accross 2 different classes.. 1 the medium/heavy armored Cleric with very slow weapons (much harder to progress), the 2nd light armored dual wield/staff Rogue (much easier with the fast weapons) As i said above, the game tries to claim that enemies abide by the same rules that govern the player, and its just not true.. They can attack you while youre in the middle of a flurry, but a little jab stops and staggers your combo.. Unless you have high poise, and heavy armor, even blocking will stagger slightly. The only weapons i was able to stagger enmies with, were maces/hammers.. Unfortunately, they are so insanely slow, and with terrible reach, landing an attack is rage endusing! Theres no closing steps, or any type of way to close a gap, short of tapping forward, and heavy attack to do the lunging attack. Enemies are always able to track your rolls (especially bosses), and can and will land an attack that should have landed far behind you. This rule does not apply to the player.(staggering is helped with AP)  Basically, everything staggers, stuns, slows, or interupts the player, but very few things hold true for enemies.. They also do not appear to have a stamina bar, of any sort. While you will struggle early on, to get anything more than a 2 shot, MAYBE 3x combo, enemies can pound away. Even with a Greatshield and Greatsword.  Sound cuts out, as do the little collectible audio logs. Some will not play at all..  Because the main attack, and block buttons are the bumpers on a 360 controller, often times your actions will not respond.. Lets face it, those buttons are garbage, and break 1st on the controller. They suck.. And because they do, the gameplay suffers.  I wanna say, i have fun when all is working well.. But its definitely a B class Souls game.. Im torn.. Some may like it, others wont.. It will help to not compare it to Souls.. I trying, but its an obvious clone, and difficult to ignore.  -Update- Im now playing as my 3rd different class.. Most of the enemies feel like 1 trick ponies.. Meaning, they have only 1 way to be beaten.. So if you have a preferred way of play, youll be swapping it alot.. Changing weapons for their preferred enemy.. The fast weapons still hold top slot for most! The bosses, have all felt the same (as far as ive been to my 5th boss).  Magic (if you can call it that) is exactly the same 4 spells for all 3 styles, with different names.. And they are really short buff times, and long cast times.. So theres no 'magic class'.. Which could be a good thing, since Souls felt like easy mode for a caster.. Having played as many, i feel confident saying its much, MUCH easier to play as a caster for 99/100 bosses accross the series! But, the options is nice..Atleast its there.....  The camera.. Oh god this camera is awful! Nearing a wall, or being knocked over puts the camera behind you as such, that Harkyn becomes invisible, so you dont know if he has stood back up or not.. Spamming dodge until he stands is the best way to know, else waiting until the enemy goes into his combo! I find far too many situations, where my camera has screwed me! The large bosses is another..  Lock-on, doesnt function in high tense situations, and only seems to work when you have a clear LoS, and are not trying desperately in the fray to lock on to a target as hes circling you (or you, him). Trying to fight without lockon, unlike Souls', is abysmal! (Lock on at start of combat, or regret it)  You'll notice that some of the enemies wont allow dmg to be inflicted when you knock them down..As theyre laying on their back. This rule also, does not apply to you. (so many rules do not)  -Minor Spoiler- Bossfight with 'Beast' was the worst yet.. The camera was constantly blocked off by the animal, and could never see what was going on.. The yellow bar thats supposed to empty for you to stagger him, didnt work AT ALL! It would drain randomly, and i mean COMPLETELY random! Sometimes i would take half ot if in a single hit, but then nothing else would lower it.. But it would chip away his hp instead? Other times, it would actually FILL IT UP!? It made no sense.. I thought maybe only can use either light, or heavy attacks,, Nope.. Made no difference.. I was only ever able to lowerr his yellow stagger bar on the initial hit, then some random attack would finally empty it.. I basically had to face tank that entire fight.. Tactics didnt work.. Sometimes when i finally did get him staggered, his head would fall outside the boundaries, rendering it out of reach of attacks.. The Dodge/hit registry was also horribly off on this boss, as you had to roll long before he ever started swinging.. His legs appear to be open, so you should walk between to get behind him, but this is folly.. Its an invisible wall, and you must roll under him entirely, or walk around him.. Very poorly implemented! Hits only register on the back of his legs,not the front.  ---Final Update--- *After a few dozen hours in this game, and several different character archetypes, and Magics, i feel as though i am having fun (When everything is working). I use the term 'working' loosely, as im not referring to technical issues (ive only had 2 crashes, 1 of which only happened after 30+hours) Its fun.. All of my previous points hold true still, but you learn to work with/around them while playing.. I love the over exaggerated armors/weapons, and beautiful artstyle of the graphics. The heavy combat, and challenging style is great.. My wish, is that this game has a sequel, with the issues get fixed.. (And a longer game, it is very short).   I still cannot recommend this game at full retail price, but at something like $30.00 brand new i could get onboard with.. I got it on sale for $9.99 during the Christmas sale, and feel like i got more than my money worth! So if its on sale, and your a fan of the Souls series, its definitely a must have, but ONLY on sale..",

For me personally, I am unable to progress PAST the start menu of the game. In fact, I can't even SEE the start menu of the game!  I know I'm not the only one who's encountering issues simillar to these, and I know others are able to run their games fine without too much hassle.

I am honestly disappointed, since I was looking forward to this game. The game had a lot of promise to be good, and possibly still does.

The gameplay looks good. The visuals look amazing.  It's not the game that's bad; It's the bugs and issues that should of been sorted out BEFORE it's release that's causing this game to plummet.

After looking into it I decided that even if it didn't end up being as great as Dark Souls (which I figured it wouldn't) it would still be worth seeing how another group handles a souls-like game. I usually don't do so but since I had the money at the time I decided to pre-order.  Unfortunately as it stands now that was a big mistake as it won't even get past the nvidia screen in the beginning of the game before it crashes. Honestly it feels like I pre-ordered a game from Gamestop and when I got home and pulled out the disc it was bent at a 90 degree angle. From what I've read around the internet it seems like a good 50 or 60 percent of people are having this issue and those that can play still get frequent crashes. I understand that making a game work across the myriad of computers that exist is difficult; however, I can only imagine two things that could have happened. Either they didn't bother to check to see how the game ran on various computers and realized that it wouldn't even start on half of them or even worse they did exactly that but didn't care enough to actually fix the issues.  I usually don't regret buying games but at this point I rather do as I feel like I've paid good money on something that doesn't even begin to work. If they manage to fix this quickly that's good but if they don't I think they are going to catch a lot of hate for it. If you plan to get this game definitely wait til they actually get it to work consistently otherwise you'll be waiting your time and money.",

            "review_text": "Rating 7/10 A good game and a recommended buy.   The crashing. If you are an nvidia user, well then, this game will crash more often than Launchpad Mcquack. Though there is an easy yet fairly inconvenient fix to this buy changing physX to the CPU in the Nvidia Control Panel. I not sure who fumbled the ball on this problem but, someone should be ashamed considering it has Nvidias logo splashed on it.   The combat system in the game is really good. It is chalaging challenging yet rewarding. The game will punish you for trying to treat it like a common hack and slash and, will teach you ver quickly that thought and, patience are necessities. When (and it will happen) a boss kicks your butt over and, over untill you get that magic round were you do everthing right and you finly beat that unforgiveing, murderous, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you really do feel a sense of accomplishment.   The weapons can feel a little too heavy. There are times when I am swinging my whatever and, I feel like a five year old kid trying to crack rock with a 20lb sledge hammer. Still, on the other side of that awkward it feels like it hits with a ton weight and the larger weapons easly break through common enemy blocks.  Not all the weapons act this way. The light weapons such as fist weapons are extraordinarily fast with high DPS combos. The mid sized weapons like the staff are a good blance of hard hitting and speed. There are lots of wepons to pick from in this game and are different enough in characteristics that most everyone can find somethign that will fit to their play style.   The graphics are simply amazing and, the environment is pretty good too. On my EVGA 970ftw, I would have to say it is one of the best looking game I have seen. The attention to even the smallest detail is phenomenal. I almost feel as if I could don the armor in RL.  The attention to detail does not however end with your armor. The environment is also masterfully done if still somewhat repetitive being compounded buy haveing to many times forced to revisit areas.  Another issue I experienced was that in tight areas or, when forced against a wall I would be pushed inside my character and, become disoriented making it hard to fight.   The story It's not bad could be made better if they had spent more money on better trained voice actors and, even then It would still be pretty forgettable.     Over all. This is a niche market game. If you enjoyed the DS games but can let this game be its self than I recomand it.  Over all the LotF is really good it has ,fun combat, inreasting bosses to fight, graphics are top notch, immersive environments and a good challenge vs reward game play style. It is not with out its flaws though. Some weapons feel too heavy, the camera can get wonky sometimes and, the bigest issue (at the time of this review) is the crashing with nvidia cards and my rating would have been higher if not for this major problem.

First of all the FPS is appauling, either on high or low settings with all the settings on or off, the game is stuttery and aweful in this regard. The game freezes too, stuttering to a crawl. It truely is an appauling port.  The game itself however started off great, getting past the FPS issues and stability issues. It was difficult in a good way, with challenging enemies and nice environments, though it took me a while to be killed. This all changes however when you get to about 20 in your main stat and health, the game becomes easy mode. Nothing poses a threat and the game becomes a walk in the park.  Couple this change of pace with a boring storyline and you're left with the feeling of why am I playing this. The only redeeming feature being the combat system that is nicely fluid. This is just stolen from Dark Souls however so this I will not include on this games merrit.  I'd be warey buying this game in the state it's in at the moment. If you have the latest generation console perhaps buy it on that instead if you can get past the tedium of the game.",

The voice acting is atrocious, as is the sound quality (it sounds like it was recorded and mixed in somone's basement). The story and dialogue, what little there is, play like they were written by Eastern European pulp authors; which I suspect they were as this game is basically an East European ripoff of the 'Souls' series.

            "review_text": "You play as a potato that has grown limbs who can talk, and combat was hyped up to me as being 'Dark-Soulsish' but feels like Dark Souls combat covered in tar and molasses.  Remember how nice that Zweihander or Black Iron Tarkus Greatsword felt like in DkS? And how much damage it did? Well, apply that speed to your basic sword, and then double that slowness if you two-hand it (Makes sense right? Right...?) and you have a LofT weapon. If you want a weapon that swings at a decent speed, you can take a caestus or dagger that deals 4-10 damage versus that sword's 80 though...  Then, of course, your enemies can attack and return to a nigh-unbreakable blocking stance like lightning. And if you can get an attack in while they are vulnerable, sometimes you will miss anyways since, unlike DkS, combat has a snap-on sort of approach like Fable. Sometimes your attack just stops short, or doesn't step forward, but sometimes it does. Enemies autotrack you with lunges, flying through the air until the reach you. On top of those major issues moving and combat just feel... mushy, or floaty. Sometimes unresponsive. You'll know what I mean if you get your hands on it.  But wait, there's magic to help you! Except that it is flaccid and useless for the most part. You don't have enough magic to make the projectile mode of the gauntlet useful since it does pitiful damage for the MP cost. The explosive mode didn't break shields let alone deal more than 50 damage to popcorn enemies, and used even more MP. The spread was kind of useful but suffers from the same molasses-covered arthritis issues that melee weapons suffer from. My Brawler magic was useless; Rage barely boosts damage, the tackler magic skill couldn't break a shield's guard (Who'da thunk it?), and prayer gives you useless amounts of healing and distracts enemies, which would be useful if your melee attacks were more predictable.  The target locking feels like playing DkS1 with a keyboard, and what I mean by that is that game had issues where you could not roll diagonally on occastion. But now in Lords you can't roll diagonally EVER. Yeah. One more layer of subtlety gone. I can't roll diagonally under an enemy's attack to get at their back, making their impenetrable defense even more fun.  I don't like the art style, though it is something you can experience before you purchase the game and it is something entirely up to personal preference. It has a severe case of Blizzard high-fantasy going on. I wish I could use my novelty-sized pauldrons as weapons, because they look quicker and deadlier than the swords I was provided.  Lastly, the story. Frankly I didn't care, because it wasn't interesting to me in the slightest. I started skipping through dialog about half an hour in. The game doesn't make you want to care for the world or the character you play. He is a meathead with tattoos on his face because 'He has a checkered past'(tm). He ends conversations with 'I don't care.' which reflects my thoughts.  Don't believe the hype. I felt ripped off and I payed $20 on this. It's a just a cash grab targetting the Dark Souls community. They didn't know what made those games good.",

            "review_text": "I bought  Lords of the Fallen  after some hesitation, due to reading a lot of reviews about stability issues causing crashes. However, after many hours of steadily working through the campaign, I experienced no issues whatsoever – no crashes, no lag, nothing; it would appear that the reported issues are not present since patch 1.4, at least in my case.  The game itself is clearly inspired by the  Dark Souls  series, but has a character of its own. The story is nothing special but works, the world design is big and spread-out with a maze of ramparts and corridors, as well as routes up towers, down into dungeons, and even other dimensions, to explore. The character selection is quite small: three magic classes each offering three types of character. From there, the range of armour, weapons and trinkets is fairly large, allowing some good customisation and mixing of gear. I like how XP can be spent on magic or skills, and that using spells of a higher level requires skill prerequisites. Each magic class has four spells to invest XP in.  The graphics are excellent, sound effects are good. The voice-acting is okay but often lacks balance; Harkyn in particular sounds too monotonous and disinterested in everything he says, whereas Yetka's lines are a bit hammy and she is too corny to make her likable. The combat system can be awkward to pick-up but, much like  Dark Souls , it's a matter of perseverance, repeated combat, levelling and only entering areas when your character can handle the enemies there. Some of the bosses can be particularly tricky to deal with, especially early in the game.  Clearly the game has three possible endings, determined with a single choice rather than a number of choices made throughout the game, so the story is linear and pre-determined. I would like to see more of these hardcore action-RPG  Dark Souls -style games but with more variety, so that the story and outcome can change considerably depending on a number of player decisions. That way, no two playthroughs can ever be the same.  Overall I'd give this game 8/10 for being very enjoyable but lacking replay value, because the storyline will always be the same however it's played.

Mixed audio, music is pretty forgettable and the voice acting is just average, i felt like some audio didn't play, like i expected to hear a thud when someone fell in a cutscene and small magic explosions didn't make any sound, its nothing major but i noticed it.  -Difficulty, At first it was kind of hard, i went with warrior and used sword and board, i had some issues with tower shield enemies, i felt like when i finally broke their guard they recovered too fast, not giving me time to do some damage, then i started to go full heavy armor and weapons, at first it didnt change much, when i broke their guard i was out of stamina so they just recovered and i had to try again, i soon realized that i had to wait for them to make a move and hit them in the short time that their guard is down before an attack, things started to become easier after that and when i got some of the better greatswords and axes i just completely wrecked everyone except for bosses, i broke the tower knights guard in 1 hit and killed them in the next, after that the only challenge was from boss fights, which were also getting really easy, so i guess if you go with strength is't just easy mode, not sure how hard it is with agility and magic classes.  -Level design, The few areas in the game were well designed and inter-connected, reminding me of Dark souls 1 but  there are only about 4-5 areas in the game, it just makes you wish there were more places to explore, which leads to:  -length, The game is too short, i finished it in 10 hours and 24 minutes, i would have gotten maybe 4 extra hours if i did all side quests but they are mostly collect-a-thons, and even then it's not just about how long it took but also that i wanted to see more of it, explore other places and do more, there's just so little content.

They are providing very poor visibility to their community on their attempts at addressing this issue and their decision to push out DLC while half of their steam forum posts are about crashes is nothing short of a slap in the face.  IF THE GAME IS EVER FIXED, I would recommend it to fans of action rpgs. It's plays like a linear dark souls. I love the art direction and their design choice to make every weapon and armor piece looks different. My only complaints with the gameplay itself is that some boss fights are boring and the heavy weapons are INSANELY slow to the point of being useless.

It's true, lets face it's totally normal that these 30 people could not fix everything/ see everything that their game could lack their sad attempt to make it into a good game failed when their weapons were so ♥♥♥♥♥ily handled, wrongly held, no character customisation, terrible storyline, buggy game and no multiplayer, killing absolutely all the replayability  So.. first, let's start with the gameplay:  The gameplay is fluid, the fights are interesting but the storyline is lacking. I found myself puzzled and looking for the next place to go. It doesn't totally explain where to go. I'm currently stuck after letting the girl go with the big fatty. This is a fun game, but it's lacking a lot from the souls franchise, like the storyline, the non crash-ness and the multiplayer.  I've played quite a lot before writing the review, and I think I'll give the little review that will make you buy this game, since it's an excellent game, it's just not 100% perfect.  pros: -fights and bosses are strategic -graphisms are gorgeous -all the stuff comes with a stylized card in game, making the weapons much more interesting -runes system.. Even though you'll most likely find yourself putting flawless luck runes -diversity of armor, weapon, fighting style -achievements -controller and non controller are both totally playable, compared to ds1  cons: -storyline is lacking, which is bad for a solo game. -crash and bugs, I didn't get that many, but I did get some. With my gaming computer, my fps are quite terrible. I'm at low settings and my computer should be able to handle much more. -very very linear. -0 replayability  in other words, if you are searching for a story telling beautiful game that will be a great experience, that is not the case. This game is monster &amp; bosses masher 2014, still fun as hell though.",

The core mechanics of a souls game is there, but the game that is developed around it is generic and flawed.  Despite the similar mechanics to a Souls series the gameplay is a fairly different, the overall movement and attack speed are heavier/slower, your stamina will burn out pretty quick so every attack counts. Magic seems really cheap to me but is sadly necessary to counter some poorly designed enemies that seem impossible to kill without casting a spell to distract them or give yourself unlimited stamina.  Boss fights are long and tedious. They have way too much HP, you'll be hitting them over and over while begging for them to die already, that is until they go into super mario mode and use an OP attack that can only be avoided a specific way or they'll take a break from the fight and spawn enemies for you to fight instead. This isn't what I consider a difficult boss fight, it's just tedious and painfully long.  The overall game design is bland and unmemorable, overly armored and large enemies wielding some heavy weapon is the formula that is applied to most enemies, even most of the bosses are guaranteed to have at lest an oversized shield. Each level follows the same design too, even when you cross over to another realm it's still snowt and stone walls as far as the eye can see. Just look at the screenshots and you've pretty much seen it all.  This is however a very pretty looking game, it's graphical fidelity is very much in favor of Nvidia as it uses Nvidia features that are rearily seen in other games, although this also alienates the game from AMD users.  In short: Lords of the Fallen is a very 'OK' game and a very good Nvidia tech demo.",

On initial release I picked it up on PS4 (before seeing the glorious volumetric light of gaming PC goodness!) and tried my best to enjoy the game but hated so many aspects of it. Those aspects still apply but seem mitigated to an extent on the PC version.   The other reviews you can see here pretty much cover the pros and cons quite extensively so I won't go to far into them but I'll give you a rundown of the issues I ran into and how I overcame them.   To start with the main issue plaugeing this game is the sheer frustration caused by frustrating enemy design such as enemies apparently being able to rotate on the spot and track you when you strafe around them even if they're mid attack. This means tougher enemies can give you a really irritating experience and having to plough through them every time you replenish your potions is a nightmare and not in a good Bloodborne nightmare way. However once you come to terms with this niggle you can soon just deal with it and get on with the game.   Some bosses either seem to rely on mobs or healing capabilities to make them challenging which is dull to say the least and mind bogglingly frustrating at worst.   The character design is okay but I personally don't much like the whole 'fat chunky 40k space marine' look that the game has gone for with their 1D main character. Controls on the PS4 also seemed a bit clunky with the 30fps refresh rate.   Playing this game on a PC at 60fps seems to have improved my experience somewhat in that the controls feel a lot more fluid and the game in general just feels a whole lot more appealing. I feel like games of this nature should attempt to aim for 60fps no matter what in the future (if mgs v can do it on xbone then dark souls like games surely can!)   Anyway I'm running on a 6600k core i5 running at 4.0ghz with a gtx 960 2gb and 16gb of DDR4 ram and it runs well on high settings.  I'd recommend playing the game if you can move past its flaws which can be quite substantial depending on what you value in a game.",

Despite these problems that make the combat slightly less smooth, I found the game enjoyable. Many secrets are around the world, which rewards exploring, as well as special challenges, which rewards backtracking. Some of the bosses are fun to fight, each having their own mechanics you have to play around.   The enemy variety is admitably lack luster, though each enemy type is different enough in that the best strategy to kill one usually isn't the same to kill another. Weapon variety didn't seem much better, many of the weapons I got were the same style/type with just a stat upgrade in some way. Though, this may be due to me simply missing the unique weapons, as there were several doors I never found the way to open and secrets I never found.   Overall, I'd certainly play this game again. If nothing else but to try out the other styles of play, and find the secrets I missed.   If I were to give one piece of advice, dashing and then blocking does a shield bash.",

If you're coming from the 'Souls series and looking for more, you could do MUCH worse than Lords. It has satisfying combat mechanics, great artwork and a fantastic atmosphere. The biggest downfall of this game, for me, was its length. Or, rather, the lack thereof.   It's short. If you manage to get the hang of the mechanics early on, you can easily battle through this game in less than 15 hours, and that's playing casually. The devs touted its replayability as a selling point, but honestly it's just New Game + with nothing new to offer you, besides trying out the other classes.  So far, there is no mention of any kind of DLC to extend the replayability of Lords, which is a shame because the game ends just when you're getting into what seems like the really good stuff.   If you see this game on sale, definitely grab it. What it offers is certainly worth dropping $20-$30.

I've first tried DS, but I found it hard to control (on PC, I had no controller then) so even though I like the idea of a harder game, I couldn't play that. And the LoF came and promised similar experiece but more tailored for casuals like me. My review in one sentence: it was totally worth it, so I recommend it to: - People who like artistic games, good graphics.  - People who always wanted to try DS, but for some reason couldn't play it. - People who like defeating big monsters in a well crafted fantasy world, be the badass.   Pros:  - Graphics, music, world design, well tailored together This is what I'd call an AAA quality game. - Every item you find has a an artistic card, story, unique feel, unique look.  - Not as hard as DS, but definitely harder then I've expected.  - Good learning curve and progress, freedom to choose different styles, combine items..  - Very stable, not crashing, runs well on the following config: C2D@3000, 8GB DDR3, Ati HD7770, SSD.  Cons: - No native support for PS4 controller. This type of game is 'written for controller' in my opinion, but when I plugged in my DualShock controler, it was not recognized by the game, nor it had options to choose it. This problem solved with DS4Windows, a freeware program. Now the PS4 controller works superb, the game even translated the vibrations. I've heared XBONE controlers are recognized by default, so this is just a small con. - Some items are useless. I've never needed a elemental res shard for example. Small runes are also useless, and you cannot do anything with them, they just sit in your pucket.. I'd be happy to see some method to combine them, reuse them or at least have the ability to delete them..  - Small bugs, I've seen like 3-4 environmental bugs, and when you die the 2nd time, your first ghost is lost, you loose the XP from it.   That's it. All in all a good game, and I'm looking forward for the expansions / LoF2. Well done.",

If the game runs, it's awesome, if it doesn't then well I guess you'll want your money back.   PROS:  A colourful and brutal game that respects the players ability to learn the enemy to win, plus other stuff that makes things difficult. I know this' been said 'nough times, but, 'it's like the D.Souls series, but still kind of isn't'. This is a good thing, a game worth paying for.   CONS:  Firstly, at the moment, many people can't even get the game running; whatever pc specs they might have. So, taking back my words, the game kind of isn't 'worth paying for' yet. Secondly, should you get the game running, it has loads of graphical bugs and fps lag; again, doesn't matter if you have good pc specs.",

The only singular thing I didn't like was that at the end of the game only a few weapons were viable while so many others that I really wanted to use were just to weak. I would have loved to see more scaling with the weapons in this game. Additionally I would like to see more uniqueness between the spell trees.",

The hitboxes are off and the 'realistic weapon control' is not favorable. The game might be better with a controller, but even then it's extremely difficult to play and has unrealistic physics for a video game.   People have said that this is 'entry-level Dark Souls', but in my opinion I would say from what I played of Dark Souls on the PS3, I would say Dark Souls is maybe like 1/8th easier than this. I have not tried playing with a controller [I do not own one for the PC, don't want to use Xpadder for PS3 controllers, PCMR or go home] but I'm pretty sure it's the same experience.  I feel like the dev team for this game put a LOT of time into the art for this game... and that was it. They did not develop gameplay or story... the story is a friggin' joke and not worth playing the game. The game's mechanics are laughable and overall, like I said, it's a stretch for ten dollars like I said.  PROS: Great art/scenery Great detail on gear Varied gear and weapons  CONS: No story Combat is not good, at all Devs strived for 'realistic combat' but it is not good for this game with combat mechanics the way they are Enemies are lacking in variation, and types of enemies are horrid (the typical 'dumb' ones, the 'burly' ones, the 'fast' type of enemy, etc)  Just overall not a good RPG game. I do not recommend purchasing this, much less any 'special' editions they have... which I unfortunately did. ",

            "review_text": "This game is a sad take on the souls series, the best input it had was the theme and come control changes.  Pros: 1. Some weapon attack combinations were interesting: doing and R1 attack then an R2 attack speeds up the r2 animation.  2. Can cancel healing with other actions.  Cons: 1. rolling, feels sluggish like my character is stuck in a jar of honey even on the lowest weight possible.  2. missing attacks, there are no different attacks for the transitions of movment as seen in the souls series so in essence this game removes many options from combat. R1 with a sword will do a basic swing, running R1 will stop the character on the spot to do the same wing attack instead of an interesting running swing animation.  The only movement transition that leads to an attack is rolling.  3. All bosses have way to much health and the animations can be cheesy taking way to long to finish. This leads the player to a gameplay of dancing around a boss waiting for its convoluted attack animation to finish just to hit the boss once and doing a small amount of damage.  Bosses should be difficult in ways other then a large health pool and long animations, an example of difficulty without using these methods would be Aava, the King's Pet from Dark Souls 2 DLC.  A boss should not be all about dragging out a fight, its good that the player must take advantage of a small break in the bosses attack but there is so little reqard for exposing a weekness.  If all bosses in the game had half the health and did twice as much damage it could help a lot.  4. My last point will be about the feel of movement in the game, all animations look amazing and blend together perfectly. But there is to much ease in to the beggining of animations, its as if any time i move, roll or jump i need to wait for a wind up for the character to actually start complete those actions.   With a small set of changes for this game i think it really could be something amazing. It looks amazing and sounds amazing but missed the punchline with the formula.",

Weapon variety is okay, there's plenty of weapons types, even though animations/movesets are pretty much the same for each type (only stats change, which is kinda dissapointing for a Souls-like game). Story didn't feel very original or even interesting, can't say for sure because i dind't finish the game, and that's because of the game's biggest problem: CRASHES/BUGS. The game just decided i wouldn't play anymore so it either crashes on startup, during loading screens or makes the floors and walls dissapear.

            "review_text": "Good god I wanted to like this. Despite the negative amount of reviews for the game, the positive ones said it's under rated. And I honestly felt that way until I got further in.  Mechanically it very similar to a souls game, which is why I wanted to and for awhile was liking it. Sure the story was kind of generic and the gear didn't feel like it had the same variety of souls gear, but it felt solid. The magic system was Meh but it worked. It even had a couple of nice ideas - the risk reward system for XP was awesome. A lot of the gear and weapons looked awesome, even though variety was so-so.  But it has 2 serious areas of shortcomings.  (1) General Design issues: Bosses are generic and not fun or very memorable. Some of them just look like gnarlier versions of the base guys. Some enemies are extremely annoying to fight leaving usually one exact way to end them quickly (standard mobs, not special mobs or bosses btw). Many of the weapons are pretty much useless, you'll go from one to the other instead of in DS where I would often rank up 2-4 different weapons and switch depending on situatuion, you'll just sick to the playstyle + strongest. Also one of the larger issues with the game - Hitboxes and targeting are effed up. Half the time you roll completely out of the way you still get hit. Your blows may not land even though they clearly did. Hell the infiltrator boss I had to one-hand my weapon instead of two handing because even though I didn't lock on, the two hand attacks would target the center of him at the lock on point(the strong spot) even if I started the attack facing one his legs (the weak spot).  (2) Technical Issues: By far my largest issue with the game. I have rig more than capable of running it at any settings. I'm not talking dual GTX 980 with 16 GB of ram, but I can run stuff like Battlefield 4 and Far Cry 4 on ultra. So even after tinkering with some settings as people recommended online, there are parts where there are just random ♥♥♥ pop-ins and chuggy frame rates. But most unforgiving are the random crashes. I haven't had a game crash this much since Vanilla WoW. I got to the point where one specific boss, it always crashes roughly at about 33% of life left. Every time. And its known issue they didn't bother to fix. I literally cannot progress anymore, tried seven times. Every time, about 1/3 life, crash. Even had it memory leak on me once in general and gave me a blue screen of death crash.   If they had made better bosses, and polished the bugs I'd recommend it in heartbeat. The core is good. The idea is ok. The execution is BULL ♥♥♥♥♥. When a game tries to emulate the style and difficulty of something like a souls game which are renowned for the hard but fair play, the amount of crashes and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hit detection is unforgivable.  Wish I could still get a refund. I mean if the bugginess prevents me from finishing it, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place.",

There is also no upgrading weapons and armor. The biggest downside would probably be the game length, it's really bland compared to DS, around 20 hours to 100% it. Bosses aren't really innovative and they often tend to be the 'big guy with a shield'. However as a dark souls fan, I must say that not many Souls-like titles exists, and this may make your wait for next installement's in From Software's franchise a bit more bearable. It can be also found incredibly cheap in external online shops. So yeah, for the price for which it is being sold, I'd grab it.",
