With better voice acting, and a 100 times more bits of insults to work with, this could actually be a real game that I would pay money for.

Minor Things:  1: Hands make this game have a concept of luck. 2: Voice was recorded in an airplane. 3: Audio is incredibly buggy (at least on the Mac port, but since this is made in unity...). 4: Lack of keyboard controls means that both players either need to share the same mouse (or whatever you use) or two mice, either way allowing for tons of cheating.  Major Things:  1: The scoring system. It's broken. Really, really broken. My opponent insulted me by saying 'That dog is a english dog pig, I bet!' (which would actually harm his own health) and I insulted him by saying 'You are vile, sir!' and he scored a ton more than me. If you don't see what's wrong there... 2: Some word combinations that should work don't, such as 'Your hovercraft talks to strangers and your hat, mate!' doesn't work because it wants a verb after 'your hat', so when I tried picking 'mate!' it damaged me for making a bad choice... what!? 3: You know what I said about the airplane this game was made in? Yeah, it's also a major thing.  This is just an overview of the several problems I encountered while playing this for about half an hour. If your game's point is to have revolutionary game mechanics, yet those same mechanics are broken to the core... your game truly sucks. As I said, good concept, horrible execution. If these problem were fixed (which I doubt as games made within a timelimit don't tend to update), this game would be great. I just don't want to bother anymore because I'll get less points for saying something short and direct ('You and your father are vile!') versus something longer and completely stupid and irrelevant ('That dog is a dead parrot, and I have proof!').
