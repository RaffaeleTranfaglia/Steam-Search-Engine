            "review_text": "Dracula Origin is a decent puzzle game. Buy it on sale or in a bundle. USE SPACE TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN CLICK. The game nowhere I could find tells you to use space to see what objects are interactive. Once I figured this out the game got a lot more fun. Some of the puzzles are fairly easy, some are quite diffiuclt, and one in particular is just insane. I used a walktrhough for the last puzzle mentioned. The graphics are decent and the interface is passable yet clunky and confusing at times. Some of the puzzles use items in ways that nobody in the real world would ever use them. Using a dead badger carcass as a wine tube for instance. Sometimes I felt somewhat angry because logic went out the window on a few of the puzzles. Being made to click through every item in your inventory to find the right one gets old real fast, especially when a more obvious choice is in your inventory. Hrmmm...should I use the sword to break the lock or the throat lozenge? Yeah that's right...the throat lozenge.......  OVERALL: 5.5/10",

This is NOT a hardcore puzzle game so to say, it is rather casual which can be nice from time to time; especially if you play it as a break from more demanding tasks or games. The graphics are nice and tidy tho you won't play it for that factor.  6/10 mediocre, I recommend this to anyone who want to enjoy a recreational puzzle game",

            "review_text": "Despite the fact that the game comes from a company, that uses to make and sometimes publish games for companies like Big Fish Games, I would say it's a Pretty Good Adventure!  So let's take things from start. The graphics of the game are a little bit older than 2008 that the game was launched. They're very tolerable if you consider the company as such I presaid. But as this company also created all the Sherlock Holmes Series I would say that I expected more at this point, even from the older Sherlock Holmes games. Maybe they didn't have the funds because when Focus Home Interactive published the last Sherlock Holmes creations of Frogwares the games in the graphic sector were totally different. Don't try any more settings than the given as you'll NOT see any difference. The game is played in 4:3 resolution monitors. Yes, even to that they miscalculated. I played the game in my widescreen 1920x1080 monitor without streching the picture and I would say that I lost a riddle and used a walkthrough because I couldn't make the letters on a notepad to decypher a text. You'll aso laugh at start when you see your character without a shadow. The videos are looking good and fair. You'll not have issues there comparing to the game resolution.  The sounds are fair too. The voices are fair enough to the overall quality of the game. Though, I would say it has very few music tracks. BUT they all match the scenes very well.  The story is very interesting. Really Dracula. You'll love it and it will keep you playing till the end. The style as written may be Gothic but what you'll see is sometimes AGAINST Gods Will and humanity. So, please, DON'T gift this game to children and completely FORBID them to buy it. Even teenagers or adults with fragile stomach will be affected by the scenes. We talk about 'Rituals', Cannibalism, tortures. That kind of things. Back to the story I would say that it unfolds as much as you search. It is the only way to progress. You can NOT avoid it. To solve the riddles the game has to be triggerred that you know the facts. So, keep it in mind. And you'll find it very interesting. You maybe compare it to the book. I started the game as I thought it was a lite one but it took me about 13 hours with solving all puzzles except two. The first reason was about resolution and the second because in a riddle the game was NOT specific enough(picture with wolves). The ONLY GREAT disappointment.. A very short END.  The riddles are good for an adventure. Like the style of 'Big Fish Games' in deeper thinking tricks and Hard tracks. Many puzzles awaited to be solved by the adventurers. BUT they are NOT so Hard anyway. Common logic and many tries to figure out the logic of the puzzle as professor Van Helsing says all the time. I didn't use a walkthrough in any of them except the ones presaid. If you want you can use the SPACE key to reveal the interaction areas, something that is written on manual ONLY. You'll find there your first walkthrough of the game that introduce you to the logic of what kind of puzzles you'll solve. I read it at the end so.. when I faced the first puzzle I said 'Yes, what now?' and tried many things to solve it. I did it and I am happy for that as I saw what I explained earlier. RTFM is the piece of advice for me even all those playing years. I can't say I was very happy of the quality and kind of all riddles. I wanted more of all kind as a Hard Core gamer I am like stronger logic, different kind of riddles of good quality and many more. The riddles are like many Mini games.  The game is very good as I finish here and the adults who have the stomach should buy it. The story surely will keep them up. They'll travel in many locations and the interest will grow more all the time. I will surely play the sequel.. Dracula Love kills",

            "review_text": "Dracula Origins is a point and click that does not have great graphics, has a great story and the puzzles are either too hard or too easy. I actually got stuck on a 'puzzle' that I had worked out the answer to but they wouldn't give me the option of entering because I hadn't looked at everything. All in all, its enjoyable. Very intuative controls and melding of items and if your not sure what you may have missed, space bar is great. Get it cheap and enjoy.",
