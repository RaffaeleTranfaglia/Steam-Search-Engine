            "review_text": "This version basically uses the same base principles as the first part. But here they totally removed some aspects of game (like never worked outpost management), weakened other (like platforming), and strenghten third (strategy mostly). Resulting game is much more interesting than amorphous A Valley Without Wind 1, but still too similar to it for my tastes. Can be quite enjoyable, if you like neverending stream of upgrades, random respawning monsters and action missions in platforming environment - wrapped up in turn-based strategy about gaining resourses against invincible foe.  7/10",

Making your game difficult by making it difficult to control doesn't make it fun. The SRPG-lite overworld mechanics were surprisingly solid, and help to drive you to finish the game as fast as possible.",

            "review_text": "- Eye-bleedingly bad art direction where everything looks like 2D paper cutouts, and only right and 45 degree angle platforms exist - Atrocious 'level design' (non-existent would be a better word for it) - Uninspired platforming gameplay - Technicolor text strewn everywhere - Achievements popping up every few seconds, mostly for things that can't be properly labeled achievements (by the 3 hour mark, I had unlocked nearly half of the game's 200 achievements) - Hodge-podge of random ideas that doesn't come together into a cohesive whole  Ok, the positives: + Quite relaxing (albeit somewhat melancholy) soundtrack that may be the overall highpoint of the game, in terms of quality + Overworld design has better overall art direction than the platforming segments + Interesting dystopic story and environment (unfortunately the writing quality is a bit lacking)",

            "review_text": "I usually take the time to play a game for at least a few hours before I decide I know enough to justify a recommendation. This time a little over a single hour was enough time for me.  This game is a platformer / strategy hybrid, which kind of reminds me of an old SNES game called 'Act Raiser'. Much like in Act Raiser, in 'A Valley Without Wind 2' you split your game time between the strategic 'map view' interface, where you have to think, plan and prioritize, and the platforming/action based 'area purification' phase.   The game offers a variety of characters to choose from. I still haven't wrapped my head around the mechanics and differences between those characters, their classes or whatever it's based on, but it does look promising when considering replayability value, as it looks like it could be interesting to try the game again using a different type of character.  I'll update and post comments as I accumulate more game time, as long as I learn anything worth adding, but so far, the game does look like it's going to drain quite a lot of my spare time. :D",

You can pick from tons of mage classes (each with 4 different spells - basically loadouts) with great names - like Lumbermancers who can cast a spell to throw a log at enemies.   With procedurally generated levels. Over 100 enemies. A strategic side that can be as easy or hard as you want. Tons of spell variety. And devs that are great about fixing/patching things in. It can be easy to sink a lot of time into this game!  You also get the first one free when you get this - though I really suggest going straight to AVWW2 which has much more focused gameplay than the first.",

            "review_text": "Reading a lot of negative reviews, especially from people who say that AVWW1 is better, I'll say mine and that is that Valley 2 is a much better game than its predecessor. First, it's a game, while AVWW1 was just barely. It has a sense of progression, and meaningfulness in what you do, while in the first title you spent hours realizing that you lost time and didn't make any real progress, and even if you progress in that game, you progress towards nothing because the game has no end (maybe if you care about achievements you can go on until you unlock them all). Not so in Valley 2, where the turn-based strategical part of the game is also much better. As in Valley 1, every game is totally different from the others, and this is also a great plus, and makes them stand apart for their originality, but overall Valley 2 is a much better balanced and fun game, where Valley 1 is fun for a while, but then it becomes repetitive and without goal.",

Secondly, the menu screen song made me spend way too much time just listening to it.",
