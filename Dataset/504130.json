The story was awesome and really fun, the gameplay was hard but not to hard (apart from the last boss battle, for me that was the most rage inducing part of the game).  I give it a 8/10, some mechanics can become boring and if not for trophy hunt there's no replayability",

            "review_text": "I would like to recommend this game, really, but the final act totally ruins the experience, bringing everything to a grinding halt for what is otherwise a humor and story driven game.  It's got fair-to-ok humor, lots of jokes that reminded me of the old Diskworld games, especially with the narrator interactions. However the humor is clearly targeting men, as the jokes are mostly physical humor, denigration and toilet laughs. Samuel literally pisses all over himself, and repeatedly vomits as a function of the game, which often comes across as lazy humor.  As you go through the tasks, you'll find that each act gives you the intro controls to a task before you have to perform. You'll have the chance to fail without consequence, before being put to the task. There are several mini-bosses, whom defeating is a task of memorization of attack sequences, and appropriate responses, however most bosses are only two or three stage ordeals, which the stage prepared you for by teaching the skills needed; like how to use a shield or a weapon. Generally the acts move along at a good clip, without getting bogged down in too many repetitive tasks, or punishments for awkward controls.   But then there's the final boss, where it really falls apart.  In no uncertain terms, the final boss is an absolute mess. You have to contend with a timed button pressing slider, utilized only a handful time times previously in the game, which seems to lag to respond as I could not get a reliable 'sweet spot' on the slider button press. Plus I was expecting more than 'memorize this' as the final boss fight, which was dissapointing and frustrating.  However the biggest sin of the final boss fight is how dull and boring it is. Even in the immediately previous minion fight there was quips and some attempt at humor to break up the repetition of the manual actions of combat. However the final boss fight is void of humor, narration, or anything to break up the 'try, try, try again' design of the fight.   The game is entertaining for the most part. It does a good job of being forgiving and providing a ramped up learning curve as the game progresses. The grannies in the car stage was one of the funniest moments for me. But you will run into a wall on the final boss, and you will bang your head against that wall.   In the end the level of frustration the game presented was, for me, not equal to the level of enjoyment. This is certainly going into my 'done with' category, and I would recommend it only to those who enjoy this kind of humor, and are willing to bull through the controls on the final boss. If you don't like the humor, or controls, in the first fifteen minutes, then you will not like this game.",

Then I plugged in my controller and it didnt work either, after some messing around I realised if I pressed u I could get the other controllers to work except the steam controller, only the thumb stick seemed to work. In addition no controllers worked when using a steam link and my xbox 360 controller only worked as a co op controller (but I couldnt get past the title screen with it alone). I can not recomend this game because of a complete and utter lack of options, and functionality. Oh and to top it off it just decided to use the left most screen with no options (I mean come on why not the main one?) But that was an easy fix, just a mild anoyance.",

A few hints here and there couldn't hurt, at least if you fail something ten times in a row (boss battle for example).  To the people saying you can't finish this game on PC: You need a proper keyboard. It's a known issue since forever, GTA San Andreas has the same problem, you couldn't drive donuts on some keyboards because you had to press WSD at the same time, most keyboards are made for typing and not for gaming. Never had that problem as I buy Logitech G-series keyboards, but read about it way back. A gaming keyboard is smarter about the way it sends signals to your PC and will support a lot of keystrokes at the same time.  I played with the Steam controller, and it was a lot of fun. I kind of doubt it would be as much fun on a keyboard, honestly. But I haven't tried. It felt a bit like Surgeon Simulator, the awkward 'I should know what I'm doing but it's not working' kind of thing that makes you rethink how you even do stuff. Story was silly with fun humor. Lovable characters.  Nothing too special, but I have no regrets buying this game. If it's on sale and you liked Surgeon Simulator, probably buy it? If not... eh, 10€ is a bit steep, but still a couple hours of fun.",
