HACK_IT seemed at first to be an interesting concept, with hacking being a cool idea for a game and intriguing to me since I played the ironically far superior hacking flash game 'Hacker' on addictinggames.   This game wasn't worth the price in any capacity. It tried to be funny, but it was not funny in the slightest. It tried to be meaningful, but instead of having meaning it turned out to be meaningless. It failed on the one thing I expected for it when I bought it. You don't hack in this game. You press one button and listen to the people responding to you. (In total there are only 3 substantial characters. You, VirusMan, and K0nsole. The other characters are either VirusMan pretending, or blue screen nonsense...  I give this game a 4/10, because while it was an interesting waste of time, it was only to see if it was going to eventually get better. It did not.   The music is pretty okay though.   ",
