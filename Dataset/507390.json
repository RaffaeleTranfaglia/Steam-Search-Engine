            "review_text": "When I first saw this I honestly was excited, I love little depressing, or meaningful story games that don't cost to much. A good example is Emily is Away but I got this and I extremely don't like it. First off the story is REALLY complicated in all honestly, There isn't much story in general, The whole time I sorta thought, man when he wakes up from this drug dream he'll go to his computer and message this girl he loves and an actual story will start, not just background and telling how depressed he feels.    The part where you're introduced to killing himself or to keep going I thought it was going to get intresting, I thought if I choose Keep going I'll keep going through a cooler story, one that happens in the present, but no, the game just ends there    The game also likes to do these random jump scares to make it seem indie and cool but its really just frighting and off point,    mostly getting hit by the truck one that made no sense what so ever    In the end I don't recommend this game at all, It seems to be made by a sixteen year old cringy indie and super edgy game developer. It also has a ton of inaccurate things and every single graphic is completely just reused a ton of the time. Save the dollar but most important, the time.",

            "review_text": "The  story  makes no sense. The game is filled with grammatical errors. The gameplay is to walk for 20-30 minutes while reading text that pops up on your screen, that is if you can handle reading a terrible so-called story with horrible English.  The game is far from pretty to look at, music is alright but nothing to brag about.  This is yet another game that touches on a controversial/sensitive subject in hopes of people to buy it because of that. *Similar to  The Housewife.  All this game does is just... say vaguely relevant things to people with self-isolation issues, depression etc...  Just because it touches on a few subjects that are touchy to some doesn't make it a good game. This is a terrible game.  Just don't buy it.   I spent 24 minutes in the game, rest of my playtime was spent AFKing for card drops.     A few bullet points to end the review.   -Virtually no options menu, which translates to no graphics menu, no volume menu, no keybinding menu etc.. There is just 1 main menu that gives you a slider for the Master volume, a slider of mouse-speed and an FoV slider.  -Do not buy the DLC, whatever the 'bonus content' is, I did not find it, it is just another money-grab by the developer.  -The story nags on things like 'modern medicine doesn't work, it is just so  they  can make money.'  -I enjoy almost all Walking Simulators, especially those that provoke thought, but this game, as I've explained, doesn't. It just mentions a few things. It's like me going onto an asset store, buying a couple assets, make that into a walking simulator and as you walk at the speed of a mouse to create the illusion that the game is long I periodically make text pop up that say things like; Depression. Suicide. Endless cycle. Nightmares. Money problems. No one to love. etc... and expecting that to make it a good game. It is nonsensical.  -The game feels unfinished, no real ending.",

            "review_text": "I went in with low expectations, but I was dissapointed. The makers have little knowledge of depression, there is no depth to the game, it's just generic 'bad things' without any meaning or rational. The story is completely vague with no character names, no voice acting. Knowing which character is interacting and what they are talking about, is really difficult. Gameplay wise it is a walking simulator so I wasn't expecting much. But I was expecting some 'hidden' items to find like diary entries etc, but no. You have 5 minutes of interacting with a couple of minor insignificant objects (and the games insistance on cactuses) and the rest is walking through a trippy 'dreamlike' state of text, some of which is mispelled and not particularily good english, and if you walk too fast (at the normal snail-pace speed) the text starts to overlap or run off the screen. Graphics are poor. Can't help but feel the makers of the game were too busy trying to be edgy. Took 15 minutes to finish. Not worth :(",

I feel like it went downhill   after you grab the knife from the kitchen  . The game is kind of like a walking simulator/visual novel, but after the point I mentioned earlier, the dialogue becomes confusing, disjointed, and wrought with poor grammar. This made the characters lack significant meaning, thus I did not care for them or their outcomes. It is clear that there were some good ideas behind this game, but they didn't come through in the experience.",
