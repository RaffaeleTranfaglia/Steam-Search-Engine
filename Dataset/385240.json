Pros:  - You can watch Gandhi bash Donald Trump's head in with a rock  - Good arena generation  - Adding characters is fairly easy, if occasionally subject to annoying bugs  - You can also create custom events with their own updates (Unfortunately you can't create regular updates yet)  - All sorts of sandbox options for shamelessly interfering in your own bloodsport   Cons:  - Bugs are frequent; thankfully, you don't encounter many during a match  - Can crash; particularly in the character list for no discernable reason  - As of yet features are somewhat sparse   Incomplete, but good if you enjoy being informed that Adolf Hitler has just punched Hillary Clinton in the face.",

            "review_text": "Honestly this game has a lot of potential and I have enjoyed my time thus far with it. It's a fairly simple Battle Royale simulation (like Hunger games). I really don't feel like I need to go over the basics of the game it's pretty self explanatory but I will below.  Essentially you pick who you want to fight against each other (you can creates custom characters, use workshop characters, or use the base characters) and then they go at it on a randomly generated (or created) map of your choosing. You can create 'event' circles that essentially are there to harm competitors. You can create landmines to hinder competitors and call in airdrops to give competitors supplies. Last person standing wins.  WARNING! Wall of text below.  Will update as game is updated.   Good:  -Easy character creator. -Good range of base characters. -Easy to use map creator. -Easy to use event creator. -Fairly simple UI (at first you might be a little confused but after 1 game it's fairly simple to navigate and understand). -Character interaction/item interaction (people will team-up/have an invisible inventory so it adds an extra layer of watching who gets to airdrops and such). -Time speed up (so you're not waiting around forever in the final 5 or so). -Pretty decent variety of maps. -Easy to upload content to workshop. -Workshop in general adds an extra layer to the game. -Harambe.    Bad:  -A lot of bugs that need to be fixed and QoL improvements (creating group with same name as another un-checks all in that group, unable to edit 'catchphrase', etc.). -Some crashes here and there. -Lack of animation, mainly for preset events (although it's somewhat understood due to custom events). -Ways people are killed are repeated multiple times over and over. -Doesn't tell you what stats do exactly. It's fairly simple to infer what they are but overall it's a bit hard to understand what they mean from the get-go. -Crashing after deciding not to pick a character portrait for a custom character. -Lack of settings option (more resolutions mainly). -A controls menu (mouse scroll to make events small/bigger and stuff like that). -There's another game on steam called Ultimate Arena.    Some suggestions for the developer:  -Make a separate box for kills/unique interactions. I want to be able to read both but especially at the start of the game it's very difficult. (Be able to toggle them on and off). -Possible view of characters inventories. -Give the player some better interaction with contestants. Like give them the ability to heal contestants and stuff like that. It's in a great general direction currently but could be improved upon. -Different shaped events (like a straight line for an bombing run or something like that). -More unique events (like feasts, airdrops that take a while to hit the ground and other stuff like that). -Tired meter? I know it's based on stats but it would be nice knowing when people would fall asleep. -More variety in loot (I see a lot of bricks and spears) - could also tie in with inventory system and kill lines.  I've really enjoyed commentating Battle Royale's since my friends can't see my screen and overall completely enjoyed by experience for $3(USD). I personally created the Dota 2 character/Map and based their stats somewhat off stats from the actual game.   Like every game it's a unique experience for everyone but I personally tried to highlight what I enjoyed. For $3 in my opinion you cannot go wrong.",
