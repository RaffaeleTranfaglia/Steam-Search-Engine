Monday Night Combat is a multiplayer shooter game that incorporates shooter mechanics, tactical tower defense mechanics, and fun mechanics into one package. So did this bizarre mix of mechanics work to the game's benefit or did it just end up being too much for one little game to take in.  Monday Night Combat may be a small game, but it was able to take in a deep breath and work the air through its system smoothly allowing for an entirely new take on multiplayer shooters.  Overall: Monday Night Combat is an enjoyable and unique multiplayer shooter that incorporates a whole lot of different mechanics into a little game. The end result is an engrossing and highly addictive experience that makes it all the worthwhile to explore the depths of indie multiplayer games.",

Matches are fast-paced and you'll find yourself running through half a dozen matches in a single sitting pretty quickly.

It plays like a mash-up between TF2 (an FPS) and Dota (quasi-RTS), except not in either of those genres (3rd person shooter/action). Having been a long time fan of Dota, this is essentially that style of game in full 3D. So you'll be pushing bots, creeping enemy bots, and looking to kill enemy pros in order to get money and upgrade your skills.  The gameplay is frantic, strategical, and always a blast to play. But it's really the stylized characters and writing that help to make the experience so memorable. The gameplay is complimented by some hilarious dialogue that really brings the futuristc world of MNC to life. Think a parody of 1984 that's treated with just the right amount of humor and you'll get the picture.   If you're on the fence about MNC, then do yourself a favor and buy it. The learning curve can be a little steep, but the game is always fun and rewarding.",

Can play competitively, with both teams trying to get their swarms of robots to the enemy's moneyball to destroy it and win, or co-operatively, protecting the moneyball against increasingly difficult hordes of robots. Killing bots (or other players) gets you money, which you can spend on single-game character upgrades or turrets. And turret upgrades. While most games would pit red team against blue team, this game has ORANGE vs Blue, which is fine by me - orange is blue's actual opposite, after all. The characters don't have as much individual personality as Team Fortress 2's characters (which are hard to beat, kind of an unfair comparison?), but personalities do exist - most visibly with the Support class character. Good for those that enjoy both tower defense and third person shooters. If you prefer tower defense, play Blitz as a Support.",

You have bots which you must escort to the opposing team's base to destroy their Moneyball. You also have turrets to defend you Moneyball from the other team's atttack. This gives the game quite a frantic pace as you try to kill other players, kill bots and destroy turrents along with defending your own base.  The game has a fairly large learning curve, in that you'll need to spend some time learning one particular class to get into it. It's a little harsher than TF2 - probably because there are only 6 peeps per team in this game so can't be propped up as much by your teammates. Better players will also dominate you to begin with. Don't worry. Your K/D ratio means nothing and you'll get there eventually.  Once you're past the curve it's a really fun MP game. There are still some issues with Blitz - the co-op mode. Hopefully that's fixed soon.",

I would describe it as Team Fortress 2 style gameplay and graphics combined with the strategy and teamwork necessary in League of Legends. Class diversity and working together are essential to win, as each map is split into several 'lanes' where your team's robots (as well as the other team's on their side) spawn, and have a specific route they go depending on their lane. Your job is to clear the way, while watching out for enemy 'Pro' players (the classes are called 'Pros') and killing them if necessary, which it usually is. But don't be fooled, this game is not all about racking up the kills! You will want to lead the robots to the opposing team's 'Money Ball,' which can be considered the home base of their base, and have them attack it while you help. The robots bring down the Money Ball's protective shield, but watch out for Turrets throughout the base! If you find serious players who work together and talk, this game is VERY addicting!",
