            "review_text": "It starts out being a blast as you rescue townsfolk, get newer and better items, and get further along into the game; but eventually devolves into repetitiveness. Although a roguelike in vein of TLoZ and BoI, it hardly gets very random. Due to this, as your skill level goes up, you get further in just to be hit by gobs of enemies. This is where the game's fault lies in as the enemies tend to take a lot of punishment before going down. As you get to the final area of the game, it gets worse in this regard as now said sponge enemies now hit like trucks and with every death you'll just be visiting the same rooms over and over and over. Now in an average roguelike, this wouldn't be a problem. In AWL, it's hardly random enough to give the player a reason to continue to do so.  Finding blueprints enables you to reduce the luck element by finding a good enough item that you can now use at the beginning of the game upon purchasing it. However, even that process could essentially be considered 'grinding' as you're going through the same places yet again to get something to help you get through the game's 3 main areas.  Due to enemies spamming you in large amounts and them being able to take a heavy amount of punishment; rather than them changing up tactics, (or even getting new attacks or becoming faster for example) they essentially don't do anything creative with them. Everything else, such as the music, is passable at best. Overall, the game's faults will eventually wear you out on enjoying it.",

            "review_text": "While this game looks nice, has a great theme and tone set by the visuals, and has a pretty nice upgrade system, there were many things that really killed my enjoyment of it.  While individual rooms are generated well, with a random layout and varied monsters, each floor is utterly predictable, from the number of rooms to the effective contents of each.  You don't do much damage, and you don't have many ways to get HP back, which is nice and reasonable, however every time you kill an enemy or break a destructable object the entire screen shakes. It seems like overkill, and quickly becomes more of an annoyance. Does every single kill need to have that impact? You can have upwards of 50 creatures on the screen at a time in some rooms. That's stopped being an occasional screen shake and become more of a semi-permanant earthquake.  The graphics look nice, but the game ran very badly on my machine. If more than one enemy was taking damage at a time the whole game seemed to tank for a few frames. If several traps go off at once, again, it tanks.  The game runs in a window, which is nice, but if you accidentally click outside the window, which is far from hard with a mouse controlled twin-stick shooter, then the game 'locks' whatever keyboard input it had until you jiggle it. for example, if you were walking downwards, you will continue walking downwards when you alt-tab back into it. For movement skills this is easy enough to fix, but it is particularly annoying when you accidentally lock down your sprint button, which prevents you from shooting and has a cooldown. Then 2-3 seconds after coming back into the game and fixing your movement, you find yourself sprinting off into the wall of spikes.  Running the game fullscreen letterboxes off either side of my screen. This is an understandable design descision, since having a fixed player camera makes sense, I won't hold that against the developers. However I will hold against them the fact that you can still click in the black regions with my mouse to target, and the game doesn't recognise that input, as if you had clicked out of the game. That's just bad.  Overall, while a nice game that would have done well as a free flash game, it quickly becomes very repeditive, and has enough buggy quality issues to make me sorely regret paying the full $15 price.",

It is the fact that not 2 runs feel the same really. But this game has way to much samey feeling. The item system is just bad. The devs should kill all items, and then rework the entire item system to be like 80% passive items that synergize. This game has 0 synergies. And honestly it is why I just can't bring myself to like it, sadly. Isaac only has 2 classes of items where you must make a choice between the item you hold or the item you find. But this game, I think all the items are a choice, you cant have 2 items to synergize, and honestly this is where this game fails...  The Binding of Isaac is just so much better. I mean look at my play times, I have over 300 hrs in Isaac and not even 20 hrs in this game, and I just don't want to play it anymore. I love Playing Isaac for its crazy synergies, but this game really has none, it is almost always the same, you very rarely find something good, and the game is just way, way, WAY too hard, out of 31 attempts I have had 0 wins  2\\10",

            "review_text": "Very addictive. Think of it like a cute, permadeath legend of zelda. You collect weapons and armour as you walk around fighting monsters, but each time you die, you go right back to the start.  If you make it far enough you have the chance to buy blueprints for weapons and to rescue townsfolk, both of which will help you in future games. So the game to my thoughts doesn't become too repetitive because even though technically you are starting at the beginning each time, you do so just that little bit stronger, with a new magic boomerang or similar which could potentially help you get just that little bit further.  If you're going to buy the game, make sure you play it through a couple of times before you judge it. The first time you die and have to start again sucks, and it isn't until you rescue your first townsperson (stage 3) that you realise just how exciting starting again can actually be. Most people who don't enjoy this game I suspect only play it for a little while. It gets better and better with each playthrough, if you give it a chance.  Technically this is a very short game - could probably finish it in an hour once you get uber enough, however to get uber will take hours of gameplay. It's a really interesting balance, and a fun little game which is well worth the price. Lots of different weapons to discover and apparently a whole heap of playable characters you can get after you beat the endboss - not that I have yet, and I've played a fair few hours.",

            "review_text": "This is an interesting little game.  I picked up A Wizard's Lizard because I wanted to try out Binding of Isaac-style gameplay but couldn't stand Isaac's art style at all. Way, way too gross for me. And I think I've gotten my money's worth so far. Full disclosure: I haven't beaten it.  Now, the myriad of reviews telling you that this game is simplistic and not nearly random enough to hold long-term appeal... they aren't wrong. The items don't have as much ridiculous variance as in Isaac, there's not nearly enough item interactivity, and almost none of them have Isaac's insane 'what's an upper bound?' appeal. The level design is far less complex than Isaac's and much more predictable. The enemies are perfectly solid, but a lot of them behave very similarly and overall none of them feel standout.  So there's the bad points. That being said, I'd still recommend you try out A Wizard's Lizard, and here's why.  First off, it's ten dollars now. It started at fifteen, which was a touch high, and I don't blame people who paid that much feeling a little shortchanged. But ten is a perfectly tolerable price for the amount of gameplay you've got in this game.  As for that gameplay... I may not have played Isaac, but I like it better purely on the face of it. The game is plenty hard--as said, I still haven't beaten it--but it never feels like it HATES you. It never wants to kick you while you're down, or feels that's necessary. You have more health, the room layouts are more forgiving... It's still not just going to roll over and die, but it's not hateful.  And it IS fun, at least fun enough that I'm still coming back and trying again after ten hours of making it to the Crypt once. It's engaging enough and challenging enough that you feel tested, and I'm STILL unlocking things. If you've been playing Binding of Isaac all these years it may not be nearly as challenging for you, but I couldn't say. And despite the cutsier art style, the story--once you learn it--is actually pretty bloody dark!  So, is this game worth buying? I think so. It's not at the TOP of my list, but if you're looking for Binding of Isaac gameplay without having to deal with updates that make the game less fun and a thematic style that's trying too hard, this might be exactly what you're looking for.",

Can make you pretty salty at times, especially when your low on health or sitting good, and you walk into a room that corners you. It makes the runs better the more you save villagers and collect blueprints ( your restarts add cash and weps/armor ) If your feeling prideful just do 'no-buy' runs but the option is there to buy. It's in a way similar to binding of issac, but if your hardcore into BoI don't expect the exact same thing, it is a different game, thus expect it like that. Overall its a nice / aggravating game, I'd recommend it.",

Boi is still a better game compared to this, though there are reviews saying that this is a game that requires skill and not somewhat item dependent, thats true. but that point being that this game is harder and sometimes makes no sense. Healing is a very rare occasion in this game, there are times where you can even not heal a single time for the whole game. Makes it so easy to die. Another point is that this is kind of a 'Grinding' game where you can start of with better items by buying them before entering the dungeon and getting the blueprint in the dungeon to unlock the specific item, so its a process of repeating to get better items to beat the game, up till now, i've done like 20 runs and beat the game 0 times. Please try out the game before buying. What u see might not be what u get.",

If you have a lower end/older computer don't even bother. You will very quickly get to a level where there is so much on the screen that your frames will drop to almost nothing and make it impossible to play at even a reasonable level.  My other issue is that there are many rooms that are just complet â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. You walk in and are surrounded by about 20 enemies instantly and have literally no chance to avoid taking massive damage and possibly dying.  At this point, I hope the devs can patch it and fix the game so it works and is reasonably difficult without going too far. Sadly, I really don't expect it to happen.",

This game is one of my favorite rogue likes of all time. What makes it unique is that it's a feel good game like you rarely get mad or rage quit when playing. This game is great and if the price scares you buy it on sale, it's completely worth it. Now if only my damn lizard was like Raga.",

            "review_text": "QUICK REVIEW -  If you enjoy randomly generated dungeons with only one life, similar to spelunky, then there's a good chance that you'll enjoy this game and should definitely pick it up.   LONG REVIEW -  You find yourself playing as Raga, a wizard's familiar, who has to save his master after his kidnapping by death. Each level of the dungeon is randomly generated and you always have to keep an eye out for any chance to improve your future dungeon runs and think about how best to spend your gold. For example there are blueprints for weapons you can buy in town before a run and lost villagers who will contribute to your starting amount of gold. Even though you only have one life per dungeon, death isn't the end. You keep going through levels as a ghost which can be both to your advantage and disadvantage. As a ghost you can get items you can't obtain while alive (keys, etc.), though you will face more enemies in the form of ghosts of enemies you've slain. To revive yourself you merely have to find a revival sigil in one of the floors of the dungeon. This presents an interesting choice, kill yourself to get special items and try to revive yourself, or play it safe and keep as much health as possible for the boss. This game reminds me a lot of playing spelunky with its random item merchants, one life per dungeon and addictive gameplay. The only features of the game that I didn't like where that you can't see what an item is before you buy it, you have to memorize what item has what perks, and that there is no way to bring up the map without having to pause the game. Overlooking these points, I really enjoyed this game and have found it quite addictive to play. I definitely recommend picking it up. ",

            "review_text": "9/10 it's the Dark Souls of Rogue-lites -IGN  All sarcasm aside, I find this game to be so addicting. While I personally lack the discriminating tastes necessary to judge graphics, I can say several things about the gameplay.  The dynamic of the life/death system seems to have quite a lot of potential, but instead it is relegated to somewhat pointless difficulty spikes and a requirement for advancing certain secrets. We could see updates that add more use to this mechanic, however.  The item variety is far from that of it's next nearest cousin, The Binding of Isaac, and the item synergies are practically nonexistant. The fact that there are 9 kinds of items in which two of the same kind are mutually exclusive (as opposed to 1/2 in Isaac), the game feels restrictive with regards to how you will built your character, practically demanding that you min-max.   I've been rather harsh on this game, but that doesn't mean I dislike it. There are several factors that actually make this game fun for me. For instance, the controls are very solid. When playing with keyboard and mouse, I know that any mistakes I made were a result of poor reflexes in all but a few cases, in which you aren't exactly given an opportunity to react fast enough.  The progression system also adds a sense of worth to even your worst runs, assuming you can get at least one blueprint and/or save one villager, which gets easier as you become better. This system makes the game even more addictive than it already is; my quote about this game being the Dark Souls of rogue-lites is actually quite accurate, since the game is punishing until learned, and still difficult once learned.  A Wizard's Lizard is a solid title despite it's somewhat restrictive nature. If it weren't for the fact that The Binding of Isaac serves as a baseline for games like this, it would be even greater in my eyes. I can't recommend this to everyone, but if you're a rogue-lite fan who feels burnt out on The Binding of Isaac, or just wants a fresh look on the sub-genre, I'd say that you should consider picking this game up.  I'm also going to add that the protagonist, Raga, is cute as a button.",
