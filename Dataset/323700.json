            "review_text": "Pixels and ghosts is the theme here!  You play the role of a Poltergeist as they attempt to spook out the occupants of the house they built and died in. To do this you can use one of your spooky abilities to instil fear into the family members that have taken up residence in your home. However you're limited in the number of times you can use each ability per level, and some levels restrict which abilities are available... and this is where the puzzle element comes into the game.  You essentially have a limited number of moods to cause enough fear to get the people to leave. Some abilities cause more fear than other, while some people in the house can counter-act the spooky spells if they see them. For example the Gypsys and 'Good' witches will stop things from flying around if they're in the same room as the spell.  The game consists of 60 levels broken into Eras of 15 'puzzles' with 3 boss encounters before you can progress. Each Era has it's own theme, and 'topical' references. Each Era has it's own musical score too, and while that might sound a little grating as it's the only music you'll hear for 15 levels, I've yet to become overly annoyed by the music. In fact I've found it to have it's own strange level of charm, however I can understand it might not be for everyone.  Essentially Poltergeist: A Pixelated Horror is a puzzle game that requires a little bit of logic and understand to solve each level.   There might be those thinking this is similar to 'The Haunting' on the Mega Drive, sadly however this game doesn't have as much freedom in choices/design when it comes to clearing out the level or spooking the residents. Despite this it's still a fun experience, one I enjoyed playing in small bursts when I had a bit of downtime or was idly watching TV.    In short a fun puzzle game to play in short blasts. For a real treat click the Rubix Cube on Level 21 a few times (may cause a bug).",

            "review_text": "This game is similar to Ghost Master. While Ghost Master gives you a little more freedom to scare how you like, Poltergeist is more of a puzzle game. You have to scare just right or you run out of powers. I know some have given this game negative reviews because of this but you need to first remember, it's a PUZZLE game. If you want more freedom to scare I recommend Ghost Master. This game is fun and will make you think. I recommend it.",

            "review_text": "So this game had an odd charm with it's graphics and gameplay but just to get it out of the way it's not worth the $8 they charge regularly.  Pros:  Charming gameplay and graphics  Interesting powers and enemies (some characters can block your abilities)  Cons: Too expensive for how short it is (60 levels)  After you beat all 60 you unlock time trial but it's just the same levels again with a timer, it's only purpose seems to be to get the achievement for doing it under 90 mins.  Wish it let you scroll back so you could see more of the rooms.  Buggy especially the noise ability that moves people to different rooms, it's so inconsistant with who it calls to the room making it annoying in some puzzles. It prioritizes special enemies and bosses but I've had which special enemy it call change from one round to the other, I've also had bosses ignore it while regular dudes move. Also I've had possessed people respond to it so they don't run away after the possession wears off, sometimes the phantom guy will stay around after it's ended, other stuff... they're not horribly gamebreaking but they are annoying.  Sometimes the special enemies block so many abilities that it becomes obvious which abilities you need to use to get rid of them and it actually makes the puzzles easier. There are some puzzles you need to think a bit for but they're generally pretty easy. It's an interesting game and worth a look if you can get it for at least 50% off but at full prices just watch some walkthrough on youtube or something.",
