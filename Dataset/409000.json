            "review_text": "Written at 11hrs gameplay, v.1.0.0 Note: I'm a big fan of OWH+. While I have gripes with the game, it is still very One Way Heroics-y. I'm bias.  GOOD   More content (characters, biomes, items, etc.)   Priest class is my new fav. Wanderer Class is good. Half-Beast (play as Dosey). Haven't tried them all yet   Same great gameplay   Improved graphics   More character art if thats your thing   Replays look even better now (but see BAD section also)   Voice acting (Partially complete English/Seemingly complete Japanese, easy to switch/turn off)   Play against other heroes--a kind of race mode thats actually pretty fun  BAD   Music a massive downgrade   Mostly annoying character dialogue (thanks to your new fairy. its a lot more 'in-your-face anime-ecchi-ish,' idk how to describe it)   they ruined dosey     No 'Hold V to skip' dialogue sequences (spam action key instead)   Speaking of V, the dash is clunky. Sometimes it works fine, others it doesnt, and i don't know why.   Only 3 save files??? Likewise there are only 3 replay save files??? (OWH+ had over 25, idk, i never hit the limit. the replay save limit is more annoying, i enjoy looking back)   Traps - completely invisible things on the ground that you/enemies will randomly walk over. I don't get why they're completely invisible and you don't seem to be able to increase detection in anyway (or detect at all apart from blindly swinging after every step if you're low hp).   Limited resolution options. Either really small, or 1920x1080.   Have to change display to windowed and back to full screen to remove a white bar across bottom of screen blocking location info (bug that should be fixed soon hopefully)   Framerate lock 30fps   Framerate issues (bug that should be fixed soon hopefully)   Can't remap minor keys (e.g. forced to use 'O' to buy/sell/trade)  SLIGHT ANNOYANCES   Opening inventory always defaults to top item i.e. it has no selection memory (for example, you have 4x dried herbs you wanna quickly use up; open inventory, scroll down to dried herb, USE, it force closes inventory, you open it back up, you gotta scroll all the way back down)   You can only set shortcuts to use/equip (not throw). I like keeping stacks of wooden arrows to throw at fleeing enemies, be nice to be able to set the shortcut to throw.  NEUTRAL   Start New Game menu changes (good overall imo, but nothing too noteworthy)   Can spend Hero Points outside of post-game screen (slight ease-of-use change)   Less steam achievements, if thats your thing (and uglier looking achievement icons imo)   Can no longer repair equipment in Dimension(Dream) Vault with Hero Points (whatever they're called now). More annoying than anything--can still repair good stuff, but you'll have to carry your heavy almost broken weapon around and find a repairer/scroll in-game instead of spending a couple hundred points in post-game screen. Note: This is only to my knowledge. It may be able to be unlocked later, not sure.  OVERALL The gameplay is still solid (excusing framerate issues ofc), and there appears to be enough extra content to warrant the $8 (if you own OWH). I still have a lot of fun, and it still has a lot of (if not more) replayability. So I recommend it to people that enjoyed SmokingWolf's original and want more.  If you have never played OWH, I can't really recommend one over the other yet. I'm leaning toward OWH and Plus, and, framerate issues aside, the music is what is tipping me.      (I wrote the below text a few hours into game before i did the above pro/cons, but i'll keep it here for those interested) the main bits that made me LIKE One Way Heroics (especially Plus) are still there: high replay value turn-based-action combat rpg with fun itemisation and good (now improved) graphics--except now there's even more content: new classes, biomes, enemies, items, etc. so, if you liked the gameplay of OWH, but want more (assuming you also played the Plus DLC), this is worth the $8.09 it currently is.  now, the parts that made me LOVE One Way Heroics, this game is missing. the biggest downfall is the music. it is extremely boring and has almost zero charm. then theres simple things like holding V to auto-skip text. and a lot of the dialogue in game is awfully annoying. the game has upped the anti of, idk how to put it... ecchi-anime-ness(?). your fairy makes random sex jokes and innuendos constantly   (until she meets Merril, an ally npc that is openly bi, and then the fairy gets disgusted by mention of sex).   basically, they got iris, stripped her of her redeeming qualities, added a bunch of in-your-face out-of-place sex obsession, and thats your new journeying partner.",

            "review_text": "It's not a bad game, but man does this game have some problems.  If you're here and thinking about buying this game, you probably played the original One Way Heroics and lost a small portion of your life to it. Me too.  Let me get right to the points: -Game is locked at 30fps, and dips frequently. I have a top end gaming laptop. Kind of embarassing, this is a major performance issue for such a simple, fun game. -The fun little scrolling updates on the left? They're gone. I guess you can use twitter to get updates? The game lost a huge amount of appeal for me when I couldn't see other people enjoying the game along with me.  These are small things that might be fixed weeks/months from now, so past these two things I'd say you should buy it! The feel of leveling, exploring, generating maps, finding loot and finding different and thoughtful ways to defeat bosses and avoid death are all still there! This is a top-notch game, despite these few flaws.",

            "review_text": "    Target Audience:     Roguelike Fans      Summary:    One of those games that you can repeatedly play over and over again, and lose a lot of time in. It's got a lot of depth in terms of its different mechanics: weight, energy, item identification, etc, etc. With a bunch of different heroes that range from your ground fighters to “oh god, avoid anything that may poke me”, you can get a good amount of strategies out of the game as well. It puts decision making at the forefront, and frankly, that's a really good thing. And while the humor and story may not work for everyone, it really worked for me. Good side characters that have interesting and dark elements to them, as you should expect from any Spike Chunsoft game. Now granted, the main story here takes a back seat to those characters, and frankly, could have used a little more development. And performance has been hit and miss for several people. Yes, it's got a 30 FPS lock (and while yes, I understand that people hate that, I think it's less important for a game like this), and while several people have indicated frame drops, I haven't seen anything on two different systems. Granted, the port itself needs some basic work done for it (I mean, there's not a quit menu option on the main screen for gods sake), but to me it's definitely playable. And that's the big draw of this game: replayability, and playing over and over again.  For the price point, it's definitely worth your time.

            "review_text": "One Way Heroics was acclaimed as a new revolutionary game that inspired a whole new genere of rogue like games. Now with a sequel (Or remake) we can all agree that we have extremely high expectations considering the production values are almost like a Triple A production. Needless to say, Indie to Triple A is not always a good jump, Sometimes the games loose the rustic feel and its beauty, for a more comercialized product that appeals a larger market.   Mystery Chronicles: One way Heroics Feels like a mash up between 1993's Mystery Dungeon by Koichi Nakamura and Final Fantasy 4 in the style of the original One way heroics by Smoking wolf.   The game is alot like its predecesor with added features, and a much higher dificulty bracket, not only does the replayability of the game shine like a highly polished gen it also still retains some of the charm the predescesor had.   I like it, it breathes new life into the old series and brings back older mechanics from games long past forgotten back for a second round. With high dificulty and amazing visuals, aside some of the minor flaws (like its 30 Fps lock!) the game is worth a buy, the price is right and the experience is forever.   Journey east friends, this sequel is worth it all.",

I scored my first victory against a player who was as green as me and only just barely won, after having exhausted all of my tricks and been forced into a dps race slugfest against the final boss.   Highly recommended for people who enjoyed the earlier OWH games or are fans of roguelikes in general.",

            "review_text": "Help! The game is even more addicting than the last! D: (And you can check how addicted I was to that if you want... Check my badge even! &gt;:U) Also for a quick note, people saying they 'beat' the game are people who say they beat creative games and games like WoW. There isn't a 'beat'.  So I guess I'll do a overview &amp; review now since it's kinda depressing to see such a great game getting such a low rating. (And rating a PIXEL game poorly for being 30 fps capped is complete BS. What would even be the point of it being 60fps?!)  Okay so, if you've played the original, it's basically all of the first game (including DLC) with a bunch of upgrades. And better. The story is pretty much the same, with new characters and a ton of new classes, and an online vs system which is basically a pretty fun race.  Full in depth stuff tiem! The game has a wall of death trailing behind you as you collect loot, gain levels, and try to become strong enough to beat the Fallen Angel to stop the Light from disintigrating the world. A pretty heavy burden for the child of the King and already so called hero...  Roguelike -&gt; Most of you probably know the flow of roguelikes but if not~. The loot and levels you collect are tied to the character, and once you die or win, that character is now gone in a sense. You can save a few items in the 'Dream Vault' which you can take out on new plays. Also permanent is the currency collected along the way (Dream and Genesis stones) used to build your castle and unlock more perks/classes/Dream Vault slots - and even some extras.  Aaaaaaand that's basically the overview, it's not overly complex. Pro/Con time.    Pros     Difficulties ranging from Easy to 'You're f'n crazy.'   Tons of classes (All of them quite different and fun in their own ways.)   LOTS to unlock   Tons of quests for alternate stories and bosses (also unlocks classes)   Huge variety of weapons - with the new Knuckles, Guns, and Boomerangs along with a few others clocking in.   A few Cameos as classes from other Chun games   A+ music,  can  get a little repetetive, but it changes as you progress   You can handicap yourself on harder difficulties and feel true pain   New Characters for followers and npcs   All unique models have pretty character art   Gallery for collected character art   A bunch of endings   Take pictures of your scores for bragging rights   Boobs   Fun/Competitive multiplayer with rewards for both sides -&gt; can get legendary weapons a different way     -This is an Eh-  Every almost every character 'likes' the Hero. Not my thing, feel like less depth in characters than the last game because of it, but I know many others dig that. It's tailored to the fans moreso.   Fun (am burning out, will try and get through this review thing)   Cons    As others have stated the VA is faintly poor   Nobody seems to be doing the VS mode race, which is a shame (I usually have to open matches myself, even then...)   Again, some of the voices sound like they used poor quality recording devices while others are fine   Everyone says hero in place of names (when they could be saying 'you' or 'them') even when it's not necessary/is obnoxious (one character doesn't do this so they're my favorite - I love you for this Keyton)   The taste of humiliating defeat   Crying in your room because you underestimated a goat   To wrap up/some complaints I've seen:   That's really it, people complain about small amounts of stuttering while running, but it's actually called the enemy taking their turn, it  is  a turned based RPG afterall. The story can be interesting to read the first few times but for this kind of game that's not even the main focus (with how many times you'll go through it you won't be paying attention most of the time anyway).   Everyone has been commenting about the VA quality, and while I  generally  agree with them on it being subpar, I loved the last game which had no Voice Acting, so. But really the voice acting for everyone but Dosey is just fine, the fairy's is the best probably. Also like I said you'll go through the story so many times you'll be skipping their chat after the first few times anyway.    About the controls... In the last game it was easiest to use the keyboard as it was technically JUST a PC release. So keep in mind this one was intended for console release as well. Nonetheless the keyboard is still pretty quick &amp; simple to use, pretty much the same as the last. But personally after trying it with a controller I'd highly recommend the controller, it just feels so much quicker and... Kind of... Uhm... It just feels so... Anyway, you can figure out the buttons pretty fast - unlike what others have said. There's only 6.     All-in-all  If you like/loved the last game, then you'll love this one as it's well worth it. The story is the same, but that's not what you and I are here for.  If you're a fan of games with high replay value, turn based RPGs, and getting chased by searing light, then definitely grab it.  I'd highly recommend this game to anyone. The main catch would be the roguelike genre itself.  If you're someone that thinks every game, even pixelated games should be at 60fps... Then go far, far away and know that my scornful gaze will be searing into your soul every time you use the restroom. There will be no reprieve for you. You will not rest. There is no forgiveness.  But yeah, I love this game. Get it! :3 (And play with me online pleeeease!) :'(  ",

It's not as smooth as original OWH, but that's expected I guess, with the added flashyness.  So, basically a great update for OWH. Better professional music, graphic, etc. The basic gameplay is basically unchanged, and some might say that the simplicity of the original fits it better, but you can't please everyone.  ...  Old review:  It hurts me to dislike this. I'm a huge fan of One Way Heroics, it's one of my favourite game of all time. This game is great update for the game. But if the framerate is any lower, it will count as powerpoint presentation. I'm not talking about stupid framerate lock or whatever you call it, the game just randomly run in slideshow speed and it basically ruin the game for me enough that I can't play it.
