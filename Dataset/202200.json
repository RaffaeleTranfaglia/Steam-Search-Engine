            "review_text": "I can totally see why a lot of people really like this game and I would love to be one of those people, but there are a few issues that ultimately make me not recommend GalCiv2. The good stuff about this game is mentioned in all the other reviews, so I'll just focus on the things I have problems with:  Combat: Yeah it's nice that you can design your own ships (even though that part isn't nearly as good as it could be) but the combat itself is 100% automated, You cannot manually take control in any way (unlike in Master of Orion 2 for example). And once you realized that only a handful of stats are relevant to the actual combat you also realize that the ship designer stuff really is pretty damn shallow.  Tech Trees: Yes, the tech trees are rather extensive, but a lot of the techs are just incremental improvements of previous ones. It feels like they artificially expanded the tech trees to extend the time it takes to get through them. Just because it's big doesn't mean it's good. Or easy to find specific techs, which brings me to:  The UI: Oh my god. How much time did I spend searching stuff. 'Oh there was this one planet that had that one thingy.... erm... well... it's here somewhere...' In particular I hate the UI for the shipyards. How many freaking times did I click on the wrong button by accident, not because I'm an idiot but because it's so very non-intuitive.  The Alt-Tab: Yeah some games hate alt-tabbing. I tend to alt tab very often because I got other stuff going on in the background. This is one of those games that really like to crash on alt-tabbing. And sometimes just randomly for good measure. Usually it ends with a black screen and I can't even open the taskmanager to kill the process. (I'm on Windows 10 btw.)  There's more, but those are my main problems with this game. If you like this kind of genre I'd say give it a try, obviously a lot of people really REALLY like this game. But I just cannot in good concience recommend this title. :(",

In its favor, it takes many of the best aspects of MOO1 and 2 and combines them. There are, however, mulitple things that mar its enjoyment. While the UI has been somewhat improved over the MOOs, Late game can still be a confusing mess, trying to manage various fleets and colonies spread out across the galaxy. The ship movement and combat system is often frustrating, and the ships often look the same on the strategic map. Both MOOs handled this much better. The last mark against it is personality, which feels like it is just a little too subdued compared to the MOOs, which had it in spades. Even with these complaints, it's still a good play for anyone who is a fan of the 4X space genre. Also, it's kind of the only game in town.",

Wanna have a fair game without the incredibly overpowered resource system? Too bad, you gonna die to the influence hogger. Tired of manually managing your planets in an immensely-sized map? Too bad, have fun with carpal tunnel, because you can't set the governor by default, and have to select him. Outsourcing work to get a fraction of the galaxy's production capability while 100% of the money goes to tourism of other civs? Too bad, the game doesn't have that. How about more political systems, like a triumvirate of sorts? Too bad, authoritarian regime and representive democracy are the only ways to go. Turning off Galactic Achievements? Are you crazy?  This is a grudge I hold with ALL 4x games: They feel like a forced, strictly competetive race. Cooperation is a game field that is not explored much, so it would've been nice to have a mode of sorts, where you can only escape bankruptcy by cooperating with other civs, and where you have to react to serious crisises. Maybe I'm just a little bit picky about the financial aspect.  Battles are stiff and lack impact. Tech screens try to be funny, and sometimes have spelling errors. Colony rushing is still effective, and that's a good thing. Building ships is troublesome with floating point sliders.  The game itself runs okay, I've encountered crashes while playing a lenghty round on immense, but otherwise it's fine. Tools are not very sophisticated and clearly lack testing; I'm having more fun with a HEX editor, tbh..  So, yeah, it's basic, and it works (mostly), but I'd like to see a more... loaded experience in the future.  I thus cannot recommend this game.  Oh, and the 3rd party DRM is pretty bad.

On paper it's got all the elements of a game I love: 4x check, sci-fi check, it's even turn-based. Master of Orion II is my favorite game of all time, and I started playing GalCiv I when someone told me that it was what MoO III should have been. I disagree.   The game is sprawling with completely inadequate tools to help you keep track of what's going on. I spend half of the time playing searching for that one planet I caught a glimpse of once, and don't get me started on resources and blackholes. I'm supposed to coordinate multiple colonies building constructors (10-20 turns) and sending them to a resource (20-30 turns) and I can't even find the resource when I want to. A searchable, sortable database of planets (like the one they had in MoO II!) and resources would go a long way toward making this game playable. Or since building starbase modules is all constructors do, why don't they just ask which resource I want to go to when I build them?   You remember how in MoO II when you sent a scout to solar system, it automatically found all the planets in that system? Not here, my friend. Even with advanced sensors, it takes weeks to explore a system. And the auto-explore feature on the scouts does not even try to find all the planets.   A lot of the game seems quirky and gimmicky. You might think that trade routes would be worth a certain steady amount based on the relative wealth, technology, and resources of the trading partner empires rewarding diversity such that if you're very different than your trading partner you make more, right? No, they pay off based on the distance between the two worlds- like the rest of your civilization isn't even involved in trade. So you make most off trade routes if you build all your freighters on just one planet, the one furthest from trading partner regardless of what you do on that planet. Then the value of the route runs through a cycle. At first it's of little value and it gradually increases to a maximum then it gradually decreases again and repeats. What the hell is that? If they cost a bunch then you had to wait then paid off all in a big lump sum, it would seem like they were going for realism with an age of discovery feel. But what's this cycle thing? Steady value seems more realistic for trade between advanced civilizations.  From the name alone, the game begs to be compared with Civilization. But if you're going to compare this game to Civilization, it desperately needs a much better GalCivilopedia because virtually every aspect of the game requires more elaboration than what's present.   Between inadequacies, redundancies, and murkiness, it seems like the designers just can't organize your thoughts. And the result is frustrating game that rapidly becomes boring. I understand why people want to say they like it, but I don't understand why they do.",

            "review_text": "This game is tediously boring.  Par for the course of these kinds of games is that you begin with a very small area and number of units, etc. and must find your way to expansion. This is always relatively boring at first, but goes quickly since there is little to do and you can click through turns quickly.  The make or break point for this category of game is how tedious it becomes once significant expansion occurs. Do you have to click on everything in the map to see if anything needs your attention every turn or does the game notify you whenever something important happens? In this area, the game is mediocre. There are notifications when significant events happen, but I still feel the need to check up on every planet periodically to know how things are going.  A huge factor for every game's enjoyability is what aspects come into focus. Every game has good and bad parts. The question is, do the good parts shine and the bad parts fade into the background or do the bad parts constantly nag you until you can't enjoy the good parts anymore? Here the game is mediocre to bad. What you consider good or bad will depend on your gaming preferences and I don't care to take the time to elaborate, but suffice to say I was not impressed with the balance (despite some quite good features).  Another big factor is the interface which is mediocre to bad depending on your adaptability and preferences. It is never good when you spend as much time finding and clicking buttons as you do making real game changing decisions.  A significant factor that made me set this game aside was that the explanations of core game concepts was weak. I read the manual before I played and also went through the tutorials. Yet, as I played, I didn't really feel like I knew what was going on in many important aspects. Some people enjoy figuring out the mystery as they go along. I do for subtle aspects and tricks. I most certainly don't for the basic core concepts (especially when having taken the time to read the manual...).  There are also a handful of other minor points against enjoying this game but I won't bother to elaborate since this is already a long enough review. The important point is that with the huge number of games available for cheap today, this one just isn't worth the (extensive, tedious) time to play.  As I side note, I do not understand at all the number of positive reviews (almost all of which are little more than 'YEAH!! AWESOME!! COOL!!! BEST GAME EVAH!!!!!'). I suppose it takes a certain kind of player to enjoy this title. Make sure you are one of them before you buy it.",

Stardock do not deserve money for this game because I said so, BUT if you want an actual review see below (once I went into the files and launched a lesser version from there)!  Graphics wise the game is definitely outdated as it was released a while back (I think) so yeah.  Performance wise I have had no problems running the game and between turns it loads relatively quickly so thats good.  Apparentely this game has a campaign but I didn't try or care for it.  Gameplay wise Gal Civ II is a masterpiece of turn based games where you build up planets with buildings and wonders much like Sid Meiers Civilization series, and spaceships which can be starbases to gain extra resources and stuff or scouts which you can explore the galaxy for Alien Civilisations and anomalies and stuff or military which is NOT FOR KILLING STARDOCK (unfortunately) and even colonies which you can colonise planets with, I find this to be a fun part of this game as claiming stuff makes me happy.  It's a shame Stardock won't let me claim this game those filthy scumbags!   Overall I give this game a 0/10 because screw ratings.",

The learning curve is steeper than most games of this type with gobs of information and techniques to learn. Basically you start out with one planet and expand your civilization to the point where you are in control of the known universe. There are dozens of ways to customize every game and dozens of different races you can select as your own and dozens of ways to improve them. You can even select what races occupy the universe with you. As can be expected, some are mean and nasty and others are peaceful.  The program is so filled with features it's impossible to describe them here. With only 8 hours into the game at this time I am only beginning to learn. I have started several different games because I discovered something important that I had missed before.  It is turned based so your able to get up and get that 2nd cup of coffee or whatever without the game changing on you.  Cons: None that I know of yet although it did crash to desktop once on me. Saving your game occasionally takes care of that.  ",

GC II feels like playing a board game that has the size of a football pitch. I kind of like its game mechanics and balance. It includes all the elements of a wide-range strategy gameplay but it does it without going too deep into them. During gameplay it means that you don't get drowned into micro management that is not a bad thing.  Ages ago there was a game called Imperium Galactica II that bests this one for me, despite the fact that is more than a decade older, because it included direct control over your planetary and space combat where your decisions could win or lose the battles (with immeasurably smaller maps I must add). With good tactics and right choices you could win against much bigger forces. I miss this 'outsmarting' option from GC II where you have automated battles where the outcome has already been fixed before the encounter itself.  Anyway, it doesn't make the game any lesser. If you support the idea of LEGOing together your own spaceships and roast the hell out of your opponents with them, it would be hard to find a more capable and fun tool. Damn, you can even build your own death star.",

Campaign modes will keep you going for hours on end and of course you can play skirmishs that are actually fun and challenging to play.
