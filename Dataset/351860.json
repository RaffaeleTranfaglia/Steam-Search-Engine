            "review_text": "Brilliant, underrated game.   This was my first game ever played. I perfectly remember how amazing the simulation was. Not even Settlers had the intricacies that Cultures has.  This is presumably the 2'nd game in the Cultures series although not shown explicitly anywhere. I did not find the original around, unless taking the GOG version.   This is the ultimate society simulation strategy game. People live, work, die - of old age, hunger. Each person has a profession. The game also involved standard resource collection but needs specified buildings to produce certain products. There is also war, combat. It's not terribly complicated, but diplomacy with other people, micromanagement plays a huge role.   There is an interesting multiplayer mode. Today it won't hurt to use Hamachi or GameRanger to make it work. The game is totally worth it if you like Black &amp; White or The Settlers series. Games aren't made anymore like this. It's a niche that is appropriately maintained by this old clascic.",
