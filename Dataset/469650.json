            "review_text": "This is an interesting attempt, But it just does not work. Normally the idea of 360 videos does not bother me when it comes to VR but there is only a total of maybe 6-7 videos, Some of them literally just being commercials for upcoming Disney movies. And on top of that the resolution on these things is pretty low because 360 camera technology just isnt super great yet, This would have been a much better experiance if Disney would have invested some time into it and actually made some 3d in engine immersive environments to just stand around in.  The worst part of this is, Once you install the application, It literally wants you to individually download each 360 video which takes longer to download than it really should. Installed it , Tried 2 videos, Uninstalled.",

So far I've downloaded a number of the 'experiences' and, as expected, enjoyed some more than others. It's really a showcase for Disney's initial venture into VR and not much else - no games to play and not interactive as such, but with VR I suppose everything is interactive...?!   The Star Wars experiences are ok but nothing special, and I'm a fairly big fan. Haven't looked at the (single) Marvel experience yet as it's a red carpet video which doesn't interest me particularly.   Should you get it? Well yes, in my opinion. The Jungle Book experience with the snake is absolutely amazing. It is, however, only for the brave! If Disney can produce more content of that calibre then I will be happy to pay for content.",

Creepy, try it yourself before you show it to your kid    A race over the surface of Jakku.   Everything below this line was completely underwhelming. I wouldn't bother downloading it.    A 360째 interview with some members of the cast of Jungle Book    Spy on Jakku: 8 short scenes showing the planet.

There are a few 'scenes' to jump into -- blurry, dodgy, 3D video that wasn't built for VR and wants to make me throw up. That's it, that's the whole app.  If you want to download and install it, I recommend just standing at the menu screen. That's the only part that's really built for VR. But you're just standing there.",
