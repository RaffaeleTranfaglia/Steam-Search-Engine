            "review_text": "This game is nearly ten years old, I'm not going to lie to you, it's aged. Not in a good way like a wine either.   The Good: The first person shooter mechanics work well, though they do feel like an older style. This game tends to be 'run and gun', think Quake, but perhaps a little more tactical. The enemy AI don't exactly outwit you, although, do they ever in a first person shooter? The combat is surprisingly fun, and the bullets feel surprisingly real. You get shot in the head with a rifle in real life, chances are you're ♥♥♥♥ed. You get shot in the head with a rifle in Call of Juarez? Chances are... you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Don't get me wrong though, this is no Dark Souls. The combat can be challenging (at least I found it so on normal difficulty), but you're not going to be repeating fights over and over again.   The story on offer whilst not ground-breaking is what any Western fan would like. You've got fabelled treasure, Mexicans, a Native American who offers spiritual guidance, and of course vengance.  The Bad:  The voice acting in this game is average as hell. In particular the main character sounded so false I'm convinced that I myself could portray a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mexican better. The Preacher's voice on the otherhand was pretty bad ♥♥♥, so not too many points lost here.  The Ugly: The graphics like the rest of the game are close to 10 years old. They're pretty gross and the textures lack diversity. That being said, you probably can't find any other game of this age that has aged any better. The graphics are still at a level where gameplay isn't a blurred mess, all the main characters look distinct and that's good enough for me!   Conclusion: Do you love Westerns? Do you like feeling love you're a cowboy? Can you tolerate a dated game?  If you're answer is yes to these, this games worth picking up. Do you love high res textures? Do you love high quality voiceacting? Do you hate dated mechanics? If you're answer is yes to these, don't bother. Get down to gamestop for the latest and greatest Assassins of Duty III - Escape to Africa :^)  My personal score: 8/10, looking forward to picking up the sequel.",

            "review_text": "To recommend or not to recommend, an impossible question without knowing who is asking and who much they're thinking of spending. The last six and a half years have be relatively kind to Call of Juarez but it is definitely one for the genre or series fans rather than everyone and the current Steam price of £14 that I'm seeing is definitely too much and I'm glad I didn't pay that much.   Mechanicially the game is quite interesting. The plot and the mechanics revolve arround two seperate characters, the young agile sneaky Billy and old psychopathic Reverend Ray. Billy's levels revolve arround stealth and movement, Ray's arround shooting everything that moves before it can shoot you. Neither is perfect, Billy's stealth ability to hide in bushes for instance is particularly dependant on the level designers whim rather than any sense of logic and the Reverend's bullettime ability with pistols is obscenely overpowered, makes no sense at all and breaks up the shooting almost as much as Fallout 3's V.A.T.S. system. So yeah, the run and gun character plays like something out of an RPG... Honestly, it isn't as bad as that sounds though and I had fun playing his levels, and Billy's for that matter, throughout the game. The fact that the mechanics are a bit different from the norm and have their own particular feel is really what has kept this game feeling fresh.   It also doesn't outstay its welcome, which admittedly is a flattering way of saying it is short but short and good is a heck of a lot better than long and boring any day. Particularly if you're not paying the sort of money that would demand a game that is both long and good.  Plot wise, well it is a western and as such it probably can't be expected to deliver too much and it doesn't really. Two fairly interesting main characters, Ray in particular wouldn't be that interesting just as a background character but as a viewpoint character he is a minor stroke of genus. Sadly the supporting cast are wooden cutouts at best. The female characters are particular badly done by. There are four in total that I noticed: there is Suzy, who works as a prosititute and who basically only exists to have her gun stolen by Billy while she is trying to 'welcome you home' behind her pimp's back. Then there is Billy's mother who is brutally murdered before she even has a chance to appear in the game and exists pretty much only as an example of the woman in the fridge trope. Then there is the sheriff's wife who is a damsel that must be rescued from some random dudes for reasons. Then there is Molly, the love interest and main female character who is pretty much the most generic boring useless damsel in distress you could hope to meet. If any of these characters had anything approaching an actual character then I must have missed it. As a side note the game should probably come with a trigger warning for sexual violence since it can't seem to shut up about it. I guess they were trying to make it sound gritty but it is completely overdone.  Would I recommend it? Well for all my gripes I did have fun and for the couple of quid I paid for it I easily got value for money out of it. I didn't pay £14 for it though and I wouldn't recommend that you do either but as a game that is still fun and interesting, so yeah, I'll recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Well this game was good. I played it, completed it just now. Graphics coulda been a little better, and it's quite buggy and glitchy, so I was tempted to not recommend it, but it's a good game really with a great story and characters. One thing that ruined it for me and has kind of put me in a downer *POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!*, is at the end, you have to shoot somebody, and it wasn't working for me when I was clicking my left and right mouse buttons or pressing two to reach for the gun in my inventory, and I had to search for like half hour what the heck was up with that and I thought it was a glitch. So I ended up nearly half smashing my keyboard mashing every button to see what worked and it didn't. But I found out you draw your gun by the controls you would use in a gun fight (moving mouse up and down), which was odd as it wasn't, and that really bugged me and put me in a grump by the time of the ending. It was a decent conclusion to the story, though it does end rather sort of obruptly if you will, not too great of a conclusion when there is a lot of things that could have been revealed, and it just pops up with 'THE END', and when you continue, you're right back at the menu again. Not very heartwarming ending from that. But, I liked it more than not so, here y'are.",

The gun fights in this game are awesome with the physics of the AI as you shoot them they die the way you shoot them instead of just falling to the ground which is a very nice touch to the game. The slow-mo action is really awesome and gives you the edge you need to defeat your enemies. The things to know when playing this game is first and far most save alot, if you don't it will bring you back quite a bit because the auto-save feature sometimes has a big gap in between each auto-save. I loved the shootouts, the scenery of the valley's,canyons, and towns were you fight. The horseback riding was fun but a little stiff. The overall game and story were very well done .
