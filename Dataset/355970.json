    "description": "Home is Where One Starts... is a short, first-person exploration game in the same vein as Dear Esther or Gone Home. It’s a story about childhood, hope, and the miracle of memory. You play as a little girl from a broken home somewhere in the American South.",

You can finish it with all 8 achievements on 2-3 playthroughs, all within an hour and a half... which is far less time than it takes for the first card to drop. Now that I have finished it, I will have to let it idle for the card drops. :)",

Especially with the ability the explore your surroundings in solitude/peace with a wonderful tune and view. I'm not gonna spoil anything, but if you ever want to get away from First Person Shooter/Action game for a bit and wind down with a easy pace (and beautiful) game, I recommend this.

            "review_text": "Home is Where One Starts is a like a bleaker take on Gone Home's formula as you play as young girl in a poor home in Virginia. While I don't think it ends up being as great as Gone Home it’s still quite good. The dev has said that he was inspired by Gone Home and Dear Esther and I can compliment the game in that it’s much more like Gone Home and it’s down to earth humanity and getting the player involved through exploration instead of Dear Esther which was too busy verbally masturbating all over itself to form any kind of meaningful story, character, theme, emotional resonance, or player engagement. The atmosphere in HiWONS is really damn good, the writing is grounded and nicely done and the voice acting really gels with and adds to it as well. There's also enough things to find to make the game interesting, there are still things I need to find that I missed in my first playthrough. Considering that this game was pretty much made by one dude that only did it as a hobby it definitely puts some games to shame, it sure as hell puts Dear Esther to shame.  Overall if you loved Gone Home and other exploration based narrative games you will enjoy this. It's not long but I felt what was here was quality stuff. Hopefully the dev doesn't just stop here and makes more because this a nice start.",

The game 'play', if you can call it that, boils down to walking around aimlessly hoping that the object you find will trigger some sort of narration or plot development. Without a walkthrough you will be walking around a long, long time. I explored this and tried different avenues and objects for 20 minutes, succeeding in only unlocking about a minutes worth of dialogue. Despite having unlocked most of the major dialogue, the game wouldn't let me progress because I hadn't found a football.  There is also no save function or autosave, so be warned that quitting will reset the walking simulator (or 'game', if we're being generous) leaving you to plod to all prior locations.  Tl;dr: Painfully drawn out and seemingly devoid of content. Avoid.",

            "review_text": "I don't mind short games. Not anymore, at least. And I don't mind walking simulators. There are some good ones out there like The Stanley Parable... and the Stanley Parable... and did I mention the Stanley Parable?  Home Is Where One Starts tells the story of a girl returning to an old trailer that she lived in with a drunk father, and you get to explore the area that she once lived in, as she recounts of her memories there. Under normal circumstances, this seems just like the kind of game I'd like, isn't it?  But these aren't normal circumstances.  First off, the world you visit, while pretty to look at is very stale after a while. There's only a handful of interactive items interspersed in this world that you can find, and actually finding them seems more like a chore, as the dog food and flask seemed more like a game of a scavenger hunt, but I wasn't promised a prize at the end.  Along with that, there really isn't anything unique to learn about the girl. Her dad was an abusive drunk, she liked space, and she liked to live out on her own, to create space from her father. Beyond that, she mentions little to nothing of her neighbors, her friends from school, her friends from out of school, her mother, her other relatives, the relationship her parents had. For a world she lived in, there aren't a lot of memories to be stimulated. Just a lot of things to look at with her voiceover telling you their significance.  If this game looks like the sort of artistic walking simulator that will whet your appetite, then by all means buy it. I'm sure you'd get more entertainment from it that I did. But I'm, unfortunately, giving this one a 5/10. I actually did want to like this game, but the lack of complexity or uniqueness makes this an ultimately forgettable experience.",

            "review_text": "I have changed my review from negative to positive. Scroll down for my original negative review. I'm changing it to positive for two reasons:  1) I eventually realized that initially I did not understand the point of the game. This is a wonderful work of minimalist/slice of life interactive storytelling, but I was expecting/looking for something different when I first played it. So, a large part of my disappointment stemmed from not getting what I expected. As it stands, the game is very successful at what it sets out to do.  2) I only realized the first point because despite not enjoying the experience at first, I found the game entering my thoughts long after I had completed it. I've dedicated more thought to this game than many others recently, and that is something I value quite a bit.  TL;DR I initially didn't like the game because I was expecting something different. I thought about it a bunch and finally understand, so I changed my recommendation.  *ORIGINAL REVIEW* With a heavy heart, I unfortunately cannot recommend this game.  I think it's a little much to ask people to pay for this experience. I'm a fan of walking simulators in general, but only when the story/experience is interesting. The premise here had loads of promise, but unfortunately the game didn't do anything to develop the premise. It's just a premise, then over. There's no real narrative payoff (although there is a very, very small emotional one), and that seems like a pretty big thing for a walking simulator to be missing.  Invisible walls could have been disguised in some way. Instead they are immersion breaking as they suddenly and unexpectedly stop the one action the player is allowed: walking. It hurts even worse because the words 'invisible walls' are literally a part of the spoken dialog, drawing unnecessary attention to itself. Aside from that, more detail could have been added throughout the world to give examinable items and locations a little more weight. This would have also helped develop the narrative.  This game has an interesting setting, but that's about it. If it had been free or much closer to free then I would feel better about the lack of content and story development. I think David Wehle has some great potential as long as he can find and deliver the right story (in its entirety). I'll be keeping an eye out for the next project.",

Dont get me wrong , it does have good music and is kinda relaxing to just walk around but on the other hand it is a very very very short game in comparison to other short games.

If you like walking sims and enjoy playing them a few times over to get the full experience of them, Home is Where One Starts is certainly something I'd suggest. It's cheap, but for just how short the game is, it still feels a little bit heavy on your pocket.  You play as a child and explore the surrounding areas of your home, which is a trailer in a rural area. Each bit of dialogue and description is a reflection of what was likely a difficult time in your life, so it's a game in which you don't want to just blow through the dialogue.  This game is intended to be thoughtful and your imagination is supposed to also do a bit of work when you find items scattered in the area. What was this girl's life like? What did it become? Did she miss the bus on purpose that day?  The game works. Gameplay is simple exploration and I didn't encounter bugs. The game itself is very pretty, even when you are in the more gritty and shocking parts of this girl's life. A swingset surrounded by trash is a very thought-provoking image that may hit some gamers a little harder than others. The music is very soothing as well.  No jumpscares. No faking out the player. It's more like a short story you can interact with. This game also allows you to explore freely (for the most part) until you start bumping into invisible walls, so feel free to walk off into oblivion, much like a bored child who really is skipping school.  It's not awful and there's a bit of a niche market for these games. Your garden variety gamers should skip this, though.",
