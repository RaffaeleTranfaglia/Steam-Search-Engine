            "review_text": "Originally released in 4 parts, Aldorlea now brings Arvale to Steam as a full game ---- and it's a very good presentation. Opening at the castle of Entoque we find our main character, Duncan, who is a gardener for the king but has apparently been at the center of world saving activities in years gone by. The problem is that he has no memory of what transpired. And so the story begins as the king sends him on a simple mission, and Duncan slowly learns more about his past, and how to uncover the details ---- which is critical because dark forces are gathering once again.  There are a ton of things to do (with a good number of side quests), things to find, people to recruit and interact with, dungeons/mazes to explore, monsters to deal with, weapons and spells to master, and a narrator to interact with as you move through the land. The narrator is full of good humor, and adds an interesting perspective to the events of the game, as well as being very helpful to the beginning player. There is as much interaction with non playing characters as I've seen in this type of game in a very long time ---- but it all adds to the exploring aspect. And this is a game where anything and everything needs to be examined for clues and information.  The artwork is beautiful throughout with battle scenes being especially well done.  Music is excellent without being obtrusive.  And there are plenty of cut scenes adding to the story.  The care and attention to detail in Arvale are easy to see and certainly enjoy throughout this well crafted game that would be a fine choice for any player of any age, of any experience. A first-rate and engaging rpg adventure. ",

            "review_text": "Arvale is quite a fun adventure that has me hooked! This old-school RPG takes me back to my Final Fantasy on SNES days. Yet it's a fresh take on the genre, with plenty of hilarious dialogue, and an almost graphic adventure-like treatment throughout. Duncan has something witty or random to say for just about every object or character you come across.   So far the story moves along nicely and keeps me wanting to find out what Duncan will remember next. The battle mechanics are a throwback to the old Final Fantasy system - not overly complicated and easy to use. I enjoy that. I find the battle difficulty strikes a good balance. It can be challenging, but never ridiculous and so far I haven't been subjected to any prolonged amount of leveling-up just to clear a dungeon of boss.  The graphics are great - exactly what I'd expect for a 16-bit era game. The soundtrack is phenomenal and catchy. Just like an FF game, it beautifully sets the tone for the all places you visit. Play controls can be with the mouse or keyboard. Overall, I'm very happy with it - excuse me, gotta play some more!",

Perhaps the humor isn't for everyone (?), but for those that do get it, it's freaking hilarious! :D The game looked a bit too simple at first, so I was a bit hesitant, but am very happy I didn't shy away!",
