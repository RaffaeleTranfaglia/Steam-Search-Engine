            "review_text": "Dreadout is a horror game about some indonesian highschool students lost in some abandoned city fill with ghost and other creature that will hunt the player. But ! You have something to counter that, a magical phone that will make the ghost disappears when you took their photos. Yep, just like in Fatal Frame.  Act 1 Review: The thing is, i really want to give this game a good review but at this current state, i can't. First thing first, i don't want to talk about the graphics because its not that good, its mediocre at its best. The texture didn't have the amount of detail that 2014 games used to have (yes, even in indie games quality), that is coming from a person that didn't really care about graphics. Now the gameplay, its very boring, you barely encounter any ghost at all and there's only 3 of them that you can actually fight. The other ghosts ? Its only part of some cheap jumpscare or puzzle that you most solve. For a game that advertise their main feature is the magical phone camera. Its a huge letdown in game design that you only use it a few times, even though Its actually really fun to defeat the ghost using the camera.  The puzzle is not really easy and no, its not because its challenging or anything, its because the game didn't tell me or guide me what so ever, how can i know i suppose to get up there to that dead end just to get the clue that let me advanced the story ? The game suppose to give a small bit a clue to help the players.  Act 2 Review: I guess i could finally kinda recommend this game, in this act they certainly improved a lot of aspect in the game which make the game better.  First of all, the puzzle is a lot better than the act 1, the 'puzzle' sense that the main character get when they stumbled upon a puzzle is easier to be noticed. Its still hard, and you still have to think to solve it, but it doesn't require luck to even stumble upon some of the puzzle like in the previous act.   The ghost encounter has been improved a lot. There's more aggresive ghost that will try to kill you and you have to use your camera to kill them, and each ghost has there own weakness which makes every encounter with them is a puzzle itself. There is less passive ghost in the game, but every ghost that you encounter has a purpose instead of just kinda standing around doing nothing or just be there to jumpscare you, some of them is part of the puzzle that will help you advance the story, and some them has some hidden story that you can collect.  The plot that this game is going for is very interesting and kinda unique. A lot of people might hate the story, but i really like it. I can't tell you anything about the story apart from that you will have to think in the end. Like, What just happen ? What the hell is the story ? Who is her ?? and that kind of stuff. But, the ending really feels like a sequel bait, which is not nice in a game. I just hope that the developer did well enough to actually make a sequel to this game.  Really fun but really short and apart from few jumpscare that are kinda scary. Its not that scary, not like the horror that Silent Hill or Outlast could give you. But i think that some people might finds it scary. I still didn't think its worth a full price if you want a memorable and scary experience. But i still recommend it, just keep your horror expectation lower and you will enjoy it.",

PROS:   -great soundtrack and sound design  -original and truly disturbing ghosts  -each ghost needs a different strategy to be beaten thus keeping you on edge  -unsettling, creepy atmosphere mantained through the whole game  -extra collectibles provide background to the story   CONS:   -below average graphics even on High settings, textures are quite blurry  -wooden animations  -combat feels clunky due to the time it takes to bring the camera up and the slow first-person speed  -boss battles alternate between easy and frustrating  -little character depth  -a few situations can be confusing due to not following the usual rules or not being properly hinted at (e.g. having to use the flash at a certain location, having to actually die at a certain point etc)  -the whole story is never properly explained and, after the end, you're left wondering what exactly happened and why  -despite being a year old and several patches there's still quite a few annoying bugs and while they're not gamebreaking they sure are annoying. I experienced achievements not unlocking properly, camera hits not registering on enemies and a couple scenes not playing properly: all those were solved by a checkpoint reload but the fact they're still in the game shows poor programming         DreadOut&nbsp;",

Well, this is the only horror game i've played in my life whatsoever lel.      ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍A bunch of students and their teacher are travelling for vacation. They discover a deserted city and decide to check what's going on there. They notice a school and take decision to get in. Here the nightmare begins. Ira becomes possessed and Linda gets separated from the group for some reason (i didn't get it). You play as one of the students, the only 'weapon' you can use is a phone you can see and kill ghosts with. Now you need to find your mates and get out of the school and city, but that's not as easy as it sounds.  ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍This pretty good Indonesian atmospheric game inspired by Fatal Frame will scare the dickens out of you. This creepy game with its excellent atmosphere won't let you relax for a moment, you had better play it using headphones and, of course, with no light. The lack of the game is graphics and performance. Even on highest settings the graphics leaves a lot to be desired but it is not a big deal, i'm ok with this. The problem is the poor performance, with such a graphics fps drops to 20 often enough and 10-15 occasionally. There are several puzzles in the game but they ain't difficult at all.    PS: First of all, play the demo.  PPS: After you finish the game listen to this song 'Mocca – Lucky Me' you might heard in act 1. Don't know why, but this song causes some keen feelings after the game.   PPPS: F*CK THOSE UPDATED OBJECTIVES!",

            "review_text": "Do you like Fatal Frame? Then you'll love this game. There are a few negatives, though:  -Boss Ghosts (one in particular) are difficult to the point of near-unfairness. -There's one sequence you're randomly thrown into with no clear direction on what to do and how to escape while being chased. However, if you're caught and lose a life, you respawn with nothing chasing you anymore, just leaving you without a threat and the same lack of direction. Hint: Use your camera to find a hidden path. -Too short. It's being released in 'episodes' so there's far more to come, but the main game released so far and all it's secrets will only last about 2-3 hours.  Despite the negatives that will no doubt be addressed later, this game is very much a fun Fatal Frame sister title and is one of the few indie horror games that I have found to be AAA-quality.

Only way to quit was to alt tab than nothing was loading I had to control alt delete to close it. And there is no invert option :C But other than those annoyances the game is great!

Once you get past it's slightly outdated graphics, what you'll find is a horror experience worthy of being considered alongside the 'horror greats' such as Project Zero/Fatal Frame and Silent Hill 2/3.  My main concern was the length of Part One. Didn't take me very long at all to complete, could probably speed run it in about 40 mins or so. I'm just hoping Part 2 is so much longer, because we have something good here, and as horror fans we owe it to ourselves to experience frights like this game on a much more regular basis!  7/10- May go up once Part 2 is released!!",

            "review_text": "DreadOut is a survival-horror game that focus heavily on puzzle solving, item hunting, and a few bosses fights if you meet the requirement items. Although graphic wise it isn't much to compare with other games with huge staff and budget, the mechanics are consistent enough and the dialogue and puzzles are decent.  Since the game mechanics mostly based on Fatal Frame (with a modern twist) it treated the player like a veteran Fatal Frame player, and the game don't hold your hand in anyway (though I recomended reading the How-to-Play at the tittle screen for beginners and veteran player either way)  The music in most cases are really well done, but a bit awkward in others. The animation of the NPCs are weird and clunky but you won't be bothered with it much since in the first act you won't be spending much time with them.  Ghost and Boss fights are well done in a lot of aspects. Some are straightforward big-scary-strong monster and some are one-shot at their weak spot. The game makes you question what strategy you should use at each ghost encounter. If you are defeated by a ghost, don't worry. The game won't punishes you harshly for your mistakes but instead sends you to a limbo stage for you to think what mistakes you have made.  At first sight, items you encountered may seems useless but if you gathered all of them, the buff, or power up, you get will eventually noticable. So, don't be afraid to explore!  The game does well to deliver an intense atmosphere once you entered the 'Night-Stage' combining music ambience and ghost passing through hallways at moments where you are most restless hearing strange noises.  Although the first act was short (about 2-3 hours first playthrough), the second act is being develop to patch as future DLC (which cost absolutely nothing, don't worry)  In summary, if you are looking for a fresh horror without western influances, and willing to sacrifice next-gen graphic, this is the game for you which only cost 15$. But if you couldn't handle the low-budget looks of the game, I suggest otherwise. But either way, you will be missing out on experiencing a new asian horror if you choose to not play this.",

Sure it's not finished yet, first act is a bit short, it isn't graphically not plot-wise exactly shining, but it has good atmosphere, devs have put some real thought into enemies and the soundtrack is great. And alternate costumes are always a big plus.  It isn't expensive, I would say it's worth of the money.

The good thing is that it does not rely completly on jump scares like some of the other survival horror games out now. I feel as though this is a game that had all the right pieces but at some moments they were not executed at their best. I would like to see an act 3 or a sequel to this game in the future.

I thought it wouldn't scare me at all if I tried it myself but it totally freaked me out and successfully made me scarejump on the first manifestation of the ghost. That was funny ! I like this game. The fact I really enjoy the gameplay in this game is also without a single doubt related to my nostalgy of the birth of 3D in video game universe as Resident Evil was my first survival horror and still pretty much the only one I love. I remember that I did beat Code veronica and despite the amazing cutscenes wasn't that much exited to play it. All the next episodes took directions that totally repulsed me as obviously the mystery is always extremely exiting while the conclusions or revelations are most often extremely disapointing when they're just related to bio weapon sci-fi unfortunately. And I mean especially in the Resident Evl serie. This character here reminds me Claire Redfield with a bit of asian blood added and despite the horrible 3D like flat identical bushes and obvious fake trees I totally enjoy the atmospehere and undoublty overly simple gameplay. Whether in cinema or video games, mostly nothing so amazing can be expected of scenarios that mix zombies and mad sci-fi or if there are titles that I haven't tried and are really interesting, then may you generously grant me your lenience. The only problem when you love to explore every corners of spacious areas in this game is Linda definitly isn't an athlete like Lara Croft. Otherwise, I really enjoy this game.",

I love the concept of using a camera/mirrors as the source of sight. By using the camera you can see ghosts, as well as entering first person pov. Sadly many ghosts can be seen without using the camera, which for me is kinda a let down. I think it adds realism to the game, that ghosts can only be seen through something like mirrors, reflections or a camera.  The story is rather 'meh', but does a great job setting the atmosphere of horror.  The gameplay itself is enjoyable. The collectables are not really of any interest really, as well as Linda's 'sprint' is miserable. There is not much mobility in the game, and most of the puzzles is near impossible to solve as there are NO clues how to solve them. As for the mobs; they are all unique: You will not run into the same mob after you've killed it once, which makes sence, since all people are unique too when alive. Since the only way of fighting them is by using the camera, it is a bit sad that not many mobs have special ways of fighting them. It is basically just snapping pics of them untill they die: I think there should be more unique fighting with more mobs having weakspots etc.  With all of that said though, the game features a lot of great horror, unique mechanics and an enjoyable gameplay. There are not many games out there such as 'DreadOut', 'Fatal Frame' etc, so this game was definitely worth the play, I enjoyed it very much. I would love to see a 3rd Act.

            "review_text": "Righty, felt that now would be the best time to write an actual review with the release of act 2 and stuff. Never really written a review before but i felt to give a try, why not? So before we go any further, if you dislike indie games, horror games, cameras, or anything relating to those things; proceed no further! This game is filled with every single 1 of those things. Now for the pros/cons:  Pros: Fatal Frame inspired gameplay Very, Very Atmospheric and tense filled Scary!  Neither pro or con: Cheap jumpscares (besides the atmosphere which is done well, they throw in some cheap jumpscares to scare you, not something i enjoy in horror games but that is me, thankfully it is kept to a minimum) Weak game length (5 - 8 hours but could be a solid time)  Cons: Story is half-♥♥♥♥♥ (Starts off good then falls apart in act 2) Gameplay can be repetitive (Horror games fix this with puzzle elements, this game has very little) Graphics are meh (for those that care about visuals) Characters aren't fleshed out well  In-depth review starts here, shorten review near the bottom with my score.  OVERVIEW: If you are expecting a top quality game, you will not find it here. However, this little gem is in a league of its own. Done by an indonesian company, Digital Happiness, this game takes elements from Fatal Frame, and silent hill and combines them to make Dreadout. You got the setting of Silent Hill and the gameplay of Fatal Frame, what more could you want!? Sounds so great and I have to say, the execution is solid and sound. While they were limited with what they have, they made more out of the little. When I first played this game, it was last year in like June when Act 1 was out on Steam. I bought it, played it and wanted more. I loved Fatal Frame and was happy to see another game use that same gameplay style.  GAMEPLAY: In this game, you don't 'charge up' your camera to do extra damage, you find weakspots on ghosts and aim for those to do more damage. Ghosts aren't pushed back when you attack them, they merely appear elsewhere and can attack in 2 ways: Physical or Mental. Unfortunately though, that is pretty much the extent of gameplay here. You use a camera to attack weakspots and not much else. Puzzles are kept to an absolute minimum meaning you won't be doing much besides running around from point A to point B and snapping a couple ghosts. Their are some bosses that are unique in their own way but felt half done honestly. The 'only' difference you will feel between ghosts is the number of shots it takes to kill them. Some take a couple, some take a lot. The only unique ghost i saw in the game that differ itself from others is when you had to use the environment to find him or use mirrors.   STORY:   EDIT: I will hold on to my previous review here of the story but it seems the developers took a route with an abstract story. Piece together the pieces scattered about and understand the whole picture. That seems to be what they intended for instead of just throwing everything at you. A nice touch but until more is understood properly, my view of the story will not change.  Another thing about horror games is the amount of files/documents you find to give you sense of backstory. In this game, that isn't possible. Their are FAR too few files to find in this game and most of them don't tell you exactly what happened at all before your arrival in town. I think I only found like 2 files that gave a hint to something about murder in the town but that is it. In Act 1, you get a decent amount of story that brings the characters into town and lose each other to Silent Hill. In Act 2, this is immediately forgotten and you have no clue what the heck is even going on. The story is no longer developed properly and the characters are completely forgotten (figuratively, not literally).   GRAPHICS: Not something I really want to go much into because unless you love visuals, graphics are on the low end for me. However, I won't leave it out. I have a decent machine so I can easily max this game out. Graphics, currently, are on the weak side because they have to be downgraded for 32-bit machines. They are expecting to release HD textures for 64-bits so I cannot judge properly on the asthetics.   ATMOSPHERE: Lastly, the thing that consitutes a good horror game is the type of atmosphere it delivers to its audience. I have to say, the atmosphere is spot on here. I felt very scared during the whole ride and couldn't help but be actually scared at some parts. The Silent Hill theme was good to give that sense of a ghost town as you walk through, not knowning what was going to happen. Unfortunately, that gets dropped for a night time travel for the rest of the game but that didn't bother me too much. I was walking slowly throughout the game, taking in my surroundings and watching my step. A couple characters gave that eerie feeling along the way like 'did she do it or WTF WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON WITH HER!?'. Overall, the atmosphere is spot on, tension was everywhere, and the entire ride i didn't know what to expect, getting that wtf moment when everything got spooky.   Overall rating: 6/10  If you are looking for a game that delivers on atmosphere and a solid Fatal Frame type gameplay, by all means dive in. Its completely worth your time and money to be able to enjoy a solid Indie-developed horror game. I would highly recommend it over a lot of other AAA type out there (but if you had to choose between alien isolation and this, go with the former). You can tell the developers tried their best to make a solid horror game so for me, I hope they continue to deliver on other horror games of this type in the future.   Otherwise, i recommend moving on. The story is weakly developed, very few puzzles and not much is developed beyond the atmosphere part.",

There were many times within the game during a ghost fight, where my heart was pounding so quickly I could not press the right keys or did not think I would win.  The controls are naturally a bit glitchy in the game, so this can be very frustrating to work with. It makes boss fights like 10 times harder. However, definitely a challenging game that is actually scary. And very interesting too---seeing as how most of the ghosts are of (i believe) Phillipine or Indonesian origin---so has alot of cultural folk ghost stories incorporated in the game.  Definitely a game that I will want to re-visit and play again.",

I don’t know if it is because of the recent update or what, but my experience with the game consisted of about 50% fun and 50% glitch. Some ghosts don’t show up even when all of the requirements for their appearance are meet, and when they do show up they are immortal.  Now, yes, there are some ghosts in this game that are designed to be immortal, but I’m not talking about those. I’m talking about regular, average ghosts that I can absolutely defeat but who simply won’t die no matter how many times I take a photo of them or their weak point.  Another glaring issue is the camera’s range. The way it works in-game is that when a ghost gets a certain distance away from you the camera’s screen gets all glitchy and then you can take their photo and deal damage. But it appears that in order for the static to manifest the ghost has to cross some sort of invisible threshold that only exists when the camera is up. So, if you pull the camera up too late or if the ghost manifests in your static-zone, the static will not appear and you cannot do damage to it. For the most part this is not an issue, but there is one boss fight in the school that takes place in a very small room and the ghost started to bum-rush me or manifest just a few feet away. Even though he was in the camera’s screen and I could take his picture, none of them did damage and he would hit me. I would run from side of the room to side of the room, pulling the camera up and taking a photo, but there was no static, no damage done, and he would soon kill me.  Dying due to glitches is bad enough, but to then see a dying-screen message of, “maybe you should consider switching to casual gaming,” is just infuriating. Add to this a bunch of achievements not triggering even when you meet their requirements exactly, and this game can become very frustrating very quickly. There were other glitches that I encountered, but they hardly effected gameplay as badly so I won’t mention them.  All of that being said, the core mechanics of wandering around a haunted town, defeating ghosts with your camera, finding articles/notes that reveal more of the plot, and finding items to increase your powers are all a lot of fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes survival horror games where you can actually fight back but aren’t unstoppable. I’d almost compare this game to the better Resident Evil titles in that you can defeat nearly all that stands against you, but just a few mistakes and you will die.  tl;dr – Good game, but tons of glitches that, if encountered, can make the game almost impossible to play. Wait till the next patch comes out and then look to see what people are saying. ",

One part, however, gave me cold feet, and not in the sense of being so frightened I didn’t want to continue, but because a certain “boss” cheated and made the game frustrating. I was inclined to hit the uninstall command.  Every time I see a pair of scissors from this time forward I’ll feel nauseous. The only way I finally figured out how to defeat the cheating AI was to use the key that was the back-step key, and twirl the mouse so that I was using that key to run forwards, instead of backwards. The AI got so confused I was finally, quite easily, able to defeat the scissor wielding cross-dresser. In spite of this, the game is one I will not soon forget. It took me just over 12 hours to complete, which I am beginning to believe is just about the perfect length for a game.  A school building being a big part of the game you eventually enter requires a cognizant approach in adventuring as it is full of spirited rooms joined by dusty halls that you’ll have to comb through in order to pick up necessary items; a process I thoroughly enjoyed. After all, it is a school, so just as one would expect the rooms and hallways to be similar, they are. Yet the classrooms and hallways are only similar in their shape and dissimilar in stains and dirt, the placement of desks, chairs, and items students have long left behind, teaching tools, etc.. Again, just as it should be. Afterwards you'll play in different 'spiritual' locales; a garden, dirt pathways, a small village, a mansion; but will eventually wind up back in the school.  DreadOut is filled with atmosphere, thus wandering and coming across ghosts makes every step threatening. There is always a sense of dread and danger. The Indonesian team of Digital Happiness have created an amazing, bone-chilling survival horror.",

Dreadout is a short, but entertaining game, worth the price tag. Admittedly the duget for the models and textures are a bit lacking comparing it to recent horror games, but it is still quite the decent effort. Dreadout plays like your stereotypical horror movie, with a group of students and a teacher arriving to a ghost town. You take control of Linda, one of the students, and the only means for survival are her physical condition and a camera to fend of the ghosts, much like in the Fatal Drame series.  If there are some complains about this game is the camera during 3rd person, which is kind of unstable in small places and corners, being a bit jerky, which leads to disorientation. Another issue is death, which after being defeated you are thrown into Limbo, in which as punishment you have to walk some distance in order to try again (the distance is diminished if you collect certain items). However, you are placed exactly at the location of your death, meaning that if you were completely surrounded by enemies, you will be stuck there being killed over and over and will have no option but to start anew. Lack of knowledge of indonesian mythology and folklore may affect, but I would use it as an opportunity to learn about other cultures.  All in all it is quite the entertaining game, worth a shot in one of those cold, dark nights.",

I will return to this game once I've regained my patience, so far I'm not impressed.    ",

I've managed to get about one hour into the game, and my experience was this: - The game's graphics is inconsistent. Some parts - faces, petty details on leaves - are nice, but all in all this 2014 piece resembles something from the last decade. - The camera is horrible. The 3rd person view is inconvenient enough from the camera placing, but it glitches every time I've tried to move through a doorway, ending up in directions I did not want to look or be. - The monsters won't react to the attacks, they appear from nothing (I know it's also a feature, but I've died more times from monsters I couldn't even see, sense, or interact with in any way. THIS, however, is NOT part of the game.) - The dubbing and the voice acting is TERRIBLE. Not to mention the pacing of the dialogues, and the story itself. - Large/massive playspace is great. However, if I have to run for 30 minutes to get from A to B in a LINEAR game, just to spend 10 more minutes on badly-dubbed and scripted dialogues to get a loading screen, then it's just a waste of time. All in all, this game did not meet my long-built expectations. It could be a great Fatal Frame remake or copy, but it... Just isn't. I asked for a refund - for the very first time.",

            "review_text": "Sorry, but I quit. This feels like playing tabletop Call of Cthulu with a pissy DM.  You were doing everything right. Things were quiet, voice acting was fairly good, things were weird and there was an air of danger....And then it took a nosedive.   The game creates a nice, creepy atmosphere and the use of mythical creatures and spirits is nice....but so far those are the only possitive points I've found. The sound is......alright, if sometimes more grating than tense.  I understand that combat, of any sort, should be a last possible option in any survival horror game. It's not scary if you can just shoot an enemy or whack them with something heavy until they resemble a fine red mist. I get that. However, you need other options if that is the case. Either running away, or at least enough of a combat mechanic not to die every time something scary pops out.  Now, I'm not saying the basic enemies are difficult or anything. Not that I have much experience beyond what you meet in the school. Though even with those, hit detection feels buggy. My problem is the boss in the school. It's been quite a while since I've encountered such an amazingly unfair fight.  First of all, it relies on quickly bringing up your camera. This would be fine, if Linda understood the concept of urgency. If you're moving even a tiny bit, she won't raise the damn phone when you hit the button. Or it might be because she has to face the direction the camera is in, which is also terrible as a mechanic in a fight that requires quick reactions. Early on this is not an issue, but the boss only gets faster and 'barely in time' soon becomes 'raise the phone when I tell you to, you bint!'  This would not be a problem, if there was room to dodge. Nope. The boss can hit you no matter how hard you hug the wall as you try to run by. And you have try to pass the boss because, guess what, if it corners you there is no way to get out of that. Considering the fight is in a very tiny room with an invisible wall in the corner thanks to the desk, this is just not fair. Especially considering you litterally have a boss who vanishes after taking a hit an can move through walls. Oh, and did I mention a single hit stunlocks you? If you get hit, prepare to eat at least 1 one more attack or even 2 if you're in a bad spot. That's not so bad, until the boss suddenly goes all Sonic the Hedgehog on you and its speed doubles. You can't run from that and odds are you'll be looking in the wrong direction when it comes out of the wall.  Which brings me to the next issue. Linda is so damned slow. I understand certain items make her faster, but bloody hell. I get it. The place is dark, scary and there are dangerous beings roaming around. I wouldn't practice free running there either, but pick up the pace a little would ya? Even her sprinting speed would cause obese kids to point and laugh.  All of this just made me feel like dying was not my fault, and I shouldn't feel that way. When I die, it should be because I ♥♥♥♥ed up or wasn't doing the right thing. It should not be because passing the boss without getting hit requires divine intervention and a particularly large rabbit's foot. I'm not asking for matrix reflexes and an arena to fight in, but I am asking for a character with more of a sense of urgency and more space than a bloody walk in closet to fight the hyperactive evil spirit.  What finally made me quit, though, was the punishment for death. Guys, one of the most important things in gaming is being able to quickly return after dying. Making it take longer and longer each time you die is not an effective punishment. I have tried everything I could think of. I stood in the center and spun around. I died. I huddled in a corner and waited. The boss came through the wall right next to me, stunlocked me and I died. I hugged the contours of the room and ran in circles, hoping to put enough distance between Linda's slow ♥♥♥ and the enemy to raise the camera in time. Guess what, I died. And each time I woke up in limbo and had to walk further and further before I could come back to life.  That did not make me think 'Darn. Well, I deserve this. At least I know what to do now.' Instead it made me judge the mind numbingly long and boring walk and think 'You know what? No. I'm not walking all the way over there to get my ♥♥♥ kicked again.'  I wanted to like this game, I really did. I still want to know what was going on, but the gameplay is not worth learning what happens in the story.",

Negatives:  4) Doesn't progessively guide you on what and where you need to go. 5) Scissor Man battle is unfair. 6) You won't know there was powerups till you die (many times) in the game. 7) Sobbing ghost battle is unfair. You won't know that you need to shoot her back. 8) Have to shoot countless times to know something is wrong with the photo?  Overall:  A good game, but is let-down by not providing a clear and progressive stages to acquiring information and power-ups. If you jumped in and figured out the rudimentary points, you will not be able to proceed any further as you won't know that you have to shoot like in point 8 a certain camera angle from a destroyed ledge to continue the game.  The developers need to spend more time to finetune gameplay and story progression. It is great that you have a village to explore, but locking gamers to the school afterwards and not guiding them, it gets downright boring fast. I didn't know there was powerups in the game, only after I died 9 times and it was from a statement during limbo stage.   The use of vignettes to indicate ghosts and information are a great point, but not obvious enough. Gamers are focused to what's onscreen and not observe what's around the screen, like me. Consider providing vibration mode for those who use gamepad controllers like the PC Xbox 360 controllers.  Hopefully the developers will redo the entire gameplay and progression once Act 2 is out. Until then, I don't recommend this game to casual gamers.",

I couldn't figure out where to go in the main courtyard after about ten minutes of wandering.

            "review_text": "Fatal Frame, this is not. My first playthrough clocking in at the 2 hour mark (for Act 1, Act 2 has not yet been released) was underwhelming. Much like Fatal Frame, the horror lies mostly in atmosphere. Initially, the atmosphere works well enough. Musical cues, ambient noises, with the occasional heavy breathing from the protagonist help drill home that the game wants you to know it is 2spooky4u.  Ghost encounters are anti-climatic. The boar-ghost poses no real threat (hide in a class room, snap photos until he leaves, resume exploring), the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ghost's jumpscare/attack is effective once, and the final encounter is literally a run to the exit repeated three times in a row. Since you respawn in the same location you 'died', you literally have zero reason to fear the ghosts outside of the one or two jumpscares thrown at you.  Oh, and there are really only two puzzles in the game. Three if you separate getting the photo from getting the key (though the photo flat out tells you where to find it, so I don't see that as a puzzle myself).   The severe lack of ghost encounters, puzzles, and general content is incredibly dissapointing. There are free horror games which provide many times more content (and are of higher quality) - Phobia 1.5 being a prime example.  Act 2 may redeem Dreadout (once it is released), however Act 1 leaves much to be desired and is not worth it's asking price of $15. I would, assuming Act 2 does release and does improve, suggest you pay no more than $5 for this game. Your money can be better spent elsewhere. Heck, Fatal Frame 1, 2, and 3 are on PSN along with Siren. You can get Fatal Frame 1 and 2 for 2/3 the price of this.  *Update*  After a quick look to the Steam forums, it seems that you're able to return to the town. After doing so I can report the following:  -You can fight one more ghost. It's hilariously easy. Maybe there are more; I didn't encounter any. -You can use your camera to see flat / 2D ghosts random float about. They don't make noises. They don't attack you. They are just cardboard cutout ghosts who circle you.  -You'll meet up with a giant ghost (whom you technically meet later in the main game), who flicks you with it's fingers as if you're a booger.
