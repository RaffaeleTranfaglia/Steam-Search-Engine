            "review_text": "Velocity Ultra is a cool shoot 'em up, where you can complete most of the levels at your own pace. You can scroll through the levels at a faster pace with the press of a button. Your ship can also teleport and hit walls without taking damage. It's an impressive spaceship, really. There are many levels, about 50 or so, and completing a level will earn you xp; xp that can be used to progress through these many levels as some of more difficult ones will still be locked at the beginning. And it's not just about navigating levels, you also have to shoot enemies (with upgradeable weapons later on) and collect escape pods. Collecting and shooting these will help you earn a bronze, silver or gold medal and these are tied to your xp. I should've mentioned that a tiny bit earlier maybe, but what the hell. Anyhoo, to make a long story short, or a short story shorter; it's an amusing game with, for me personally, not enough content to keep me coming back for more. Then again, it's a shoot 'em up and I've rarely seen one with tons of content. Still, entertaining. Certainly not bad.  [Rating: 73/100]",

            "review_text": "Velocity Ultra with a 360 controller feels better than any shoot-em-up (shmup) I've ever played. Throwing powerful bombs in every direction is as easy as flicking the right stick, yet the less-powerful main guns have their place. Every stage in Velocity is designed like a puzzle, with switches to hit in a certain order, enemies to kill, and civilian pods to rescue. A single miss-placed bomb can reset the switches, while the main guns take far more shots to activate a switch.  Switches and shmups wouldn't seem fun on paper, but Velocity includes a teleportation feature that makes missing a switch far less punishing than it would be otherwise. In certain levels, you can place a limited number of checkpoints to allow you to hop between switches with ease. The teleportation isn't limited to the checkpoints, however, as you are also free to teleport into any open space you can see.  The combination of the shooting, switches, and teleportation with a screen that constantly scrolls upwards (you're always forced to go forwards, so without the teleport you could never move back) seems overwhelming. However, Velocity does a very good job with pacing. As someone who is usually terrible at these kinds of games, I was surprised how quickly and easily I got into the game. I'll probably never get a handle on all the systems in play, but I'm definitely having fun.  I only have two issues with the game. First, manually teleporting around the map feels extremely clunky, and I've died several times from the cursor refusing to recognize a space as empty. Second, levels are gated by XP, so if your not good at these kinds of games you may find yourself forced to replay levels in order to progress.  Overall a good game. Not as good with a keyboard, but playable.",

            "review_text": "Good quality shoot'em up with a special difference - there are solid obsacles which could be traversed only with RMB drag. So it's a game of agility and hands' coordination, surely it demands much training. However the world of the game is far from adorable and it suits mostly the fans of the genre.  Хорошая, качественно сделанная расстреляйка с важной особенностью - есть непреодолимые стены, за которые можно только телепортироваться при помощи перетягивания мыши с зажатой правой кнопкой. Таким образом, это игра на ловкость и координацию работы рук, требующая серьезной тренировки. Мир ее, однако, в себя не влюбляет, поэтому подходит лишь фанатам жанра.",

            "review_text": "When i got this game i was expecting no more then a scrolling shooter game. But there are some very interesting and cool mechanics i haven't seen in any other game of the genre, its really more of a shooter/puzzle game. You need to fins out how to save the most survivors, kill the most badguys and finish the level in the quickest amount of time using very cool mechanics like boost (speeds up how fast the level scrolls) teleporting through walls and dropping telepods that allow you to travel back to a previous point in the level to get any survivors or secrets you may have missed. sure it's a short game at 50 levels that shouldnt take more then 1-3 minutes each but its very replayable and has medals and achivements and online scores to compare to. and they game works just as well with keyboard or controller (i like playing it with 360 controller) and despite it being cartoony and 2d everything looks great in the in game levels and the artwork for cutscenes. awesome lil game 9/10",
