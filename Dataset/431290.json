You get a couple of hours of fairly decent game. It's perhaps a little easy, at least I found, but hunting the collectables are fun. Good luck figuring out the safe combinations though, because some I NEVER EVER would have worked out as they are so obscure.  I also had an issue with the game loading on my secondary monitor and it was impossible to move it. It has no options for graphic settings.  It doesn't deserve a thumbs down, at least from me as I didn't  dislike  playing it. Play it if you want, you're not missing anything really if you don't though.",
