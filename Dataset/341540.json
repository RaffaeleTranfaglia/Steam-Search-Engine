And even better, Second Life is free, and offers you an extremely customizable avatar. See my profile pic? That's a tribute avatar I compiled and customized in Second Life. So you can look pretty (or pretty good) while being bored to tears there, too, if that's really your thing.  If you want the experience offered here, just go visit Second Life, find a few artsy parks, and wander around. Or just wander around in general. There's more to explore, the colors don't give you a headache, you get to see at least as much weird stuff as you do in this game, you have a highly customizable avatar, and Second Life is free to visit.",

There are some tiny stories but overall it's pretty forgettable to be honest. I played long time ago and it was probably about 10 minutes or so. I bought it from Humble Bundle of sorts.",
