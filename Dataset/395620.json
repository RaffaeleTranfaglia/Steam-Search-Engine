            "review_text": "Ittle Dew was mainly a puzzle game, and a very short one too. Ittle Dew 2 is MUCH larger and focuses more on the combat than puzzles, but puzzles are still as hard as the first game. There are sooooo many secrets in Ittle Dew 2 that I could compare the meta and out-of-game puzzles to the likes of The Witness, Fez, Knytt Underground, etc. The Steam community for this game has found all sorts of hidden secrets and even some secret bosses that nearly double the length of the normal campaign (which is already pretty long). If Ittle Dew 1 was the Light World from A Link to the Past, Ittle Dew 2 is the Dark World; this sequel to one of the best indie puzzle adventures feels like a full adventure, is absolutely worth the cost, and I think many people would enjoy the MASSIVE amount of secrets in the game!",

            "review_text": "I wish steam had a point system for reviews rather than a simple yes/no. I really really loved the first Ittle Dew. It was clever, funny, challenging, endearing, and ... the list could go on and on. While I enjoyed this second game, I can't recommend it, especially at its current price ($20). I only spent this amount on it cause I loved the first so much.  This second game is more of the same puzzle wise, but it really doesn't have the spark of magic does like the first. It was fun to play through, but I don't know if I would really recommend it. The humor isn't there at all. There is no more character building. All the jokes are just mostly just 'hey, remember this joke from the first game?'.  Almost all puzzles are solvable with no extra special items. The only dungeon you need an item in is the one you got it in (and the final+extra dungeons). Because of this, the puzzles are really droll. It doesn't feel like you are progressing through a game like the first. More just... exploring the whole world. I have a feeling people complained about certain aspects of the first game, which the developers tried to solve with this second game, but actually made it fall flat on its face.  It was a really good idea to include a map with locations of everything you have found, cause otherwise, I would have never found most of the 'secret' areas.  In all, the new game just... lacks everything that made the original game great. I had fun going through it and solving all the puzzles, but that is about it. For this reason, I would definitely not recommend it to people who hadn't played the first.",
