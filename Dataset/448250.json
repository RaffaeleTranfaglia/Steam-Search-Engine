            "review_text": "Well the game works kind of...... It's a simple platform game where you basically move left or right in combination with jumping, avoid the traps and you win. It felt like sometimes you got a big jump and sometimes it was a small jump, I don't know why or if it was me. The music, it feels a bit heavy for this type of game.... I think it has potential as a kids game but not at this price point(Â£3.99). I cannot recomend this game, maybe that will change in the future if there are some updates...",
