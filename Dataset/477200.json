            "review_text": "I have spent over $700 on Descent and my collection is short 5 out of print lieutenants. Ive been collecting long before the Road to Legend App became a thing and I do not regret a single penny. Ive also put in countless hours into the android app.   Descent is an asymmetrical dungeon crawl board game, much like a far more in depth, detailed and dynamic version of Hero Quest. One person plays as the Overlord and controls the games monsters, villains and traps, the other (up to) 4 players take on the roles of the Heroes.   The Road to Legend App replaces the Overlord player with a computer opponent so that all the players can work cooperatively. This means that you wind up in the situation where you have a physical game with a digital opponent and narrator which is an utterly unique experience.   Descent itself is a truly beautiful board game. The miniatures are pretty, the interlocking map tiles are pretty. Road to Legend follows a story with a laid out set of maps forming a campaign and the campaigns are offered for free. If you own physical copies of the expansions, Road to Legend will incorporate those new heroes, monsters, classes etc into the road to legend campaigns, keeping things fresh.   Descent is easily worth the $60 purchase price on Amazon. However do keep in mind that although the entry point may be low, if you start collecting things will get expensive quick. The base game and expansions are all great value for money. The Hero and Monster packs less so, but they do add a ton of variety. The Leuitenent packs (which act as playable characters for the overlord) are the worst value for money, but once you have all the rest you really dont want the games big bad guys being represented by a token. Its so more satisfying to slay the mighty dragon when its a gigantic figure on the board!   Road to Legend is a wonderful blend on Video game and physical board game. I cant recommend it highly enough!",

            "review_text": "Road to Legend is simply one of the best 'expansions' you can get for Descent: Journeys in the Dark 2nd edition. The fact that this thing is free with fully functional campaigns is absolutely mind-blowing considering the production value (there are actual voice overs for the story of the campaigns).  The app follows the core rule set of D2E, but has additional rules in place because it's fully co-op and thus no player will play the role of the Overlord.   Core differences:",

It is very intuitive and easy to use if you're familiar with the base rules. It has even gotten me to buy several extra expansions. I hope that they continue to release additional campaigns, as we are blowing through the existing ones!",

It is especially great for introducing newer players to the basic mechanics of the game since everyone gets to win/lose as a team.  Some of the game mechanics are tweaked to adjust for removing the OL, but after a test run the balance and challenge seem to be pretty spot on. There are a few situtations that will come up where players have to use their judgement, but the AI is usually good enough that the different options a monster may take are minor.  This is a must have companion and a testament to the quality of FFG products.",
