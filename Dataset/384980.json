            "review_text": "A game designed for a mobile platform landed here on steam. Can't even appreciate the usability of skills despite the time limit/moves while keeping units alive on some sticky situations. The art design is clean compared to some games I don't dare to mention.   The learning curve of the game is simple that the player pretty much:   Connect tiles.   Spawn units then use some items now and then.   Clear a level/got defeated.   Earn coins   Upgrade.   Then do it again.    It's fun to see units pushing back enemies. Despite that, it's a little bit lacking due to the resolution screen of the game. Clearly the devs have been lazy modifing this game into a pc platform. The game is a day to perfect without the pay to win function (also when the devs removed the base camp respawner). Yet in essence it is repeating, tiring and exhausting to grind coins for unit upgrades.",

            "review_text": "  This game is a match the tiles kind of game, similar to Candy Crush, Chuzzle, Bejewelled etc. However, there's one thing that's different - when you match a minimum of three tiles you summon a unit, the icons on the tile represent a type of unit, you can summon two units by matching 4 tiles, 3 by matching 5 and it's possible to summon more if you're lucky.  There are 60 different levels and 12 units, the difficulty increases quite soon after you reach the double digit levels, fortunately, there's an upgrade system you can utilize to improve unit stats, the effectiveness of items as well as the health of your 'base'(a wagon) and the amount of coins you receive when matching coin tiles. Upgrades do cost quite a bit, you can either buy more coins with real life money or slowly grind for upgrades(despite the grinding being rather slow, each 'match' can take seconds to minutes) and yes you can replay completed levels.  Quite a fun matching game but you have to be quick as there are time/match limits that vary with different levels.",

            "review_text": "While I do give Battle for Blood a thumbs up, I don't necessarily absolutely recommend this game.  The match 3 mechanic is an old, rather solid one, and combined with the upgrading system of the different units throughout the game, it is rather easy to get the hang of it. What is not so nice is the fact that it is nigh impossible to earn a lot of coins by repeating stages. Even more so, it will become incredibly difficult to make the necessary coins to affors the pricier upgrades. Hence, we are back at what we loathe - micro-transactions, to get the best out of the units, and even if you only want to do a couple of them.  And it isn't a particularly long game either. Battle for Blood only took me approximately 3.5 hours to really complete with one straight playthrough (aided by a micro-transaction, though it rather felt like a macro-transaction). As said, it is easy to play, but the coin-earning is a pain. And even with my love for grinding, I have to say: what you get from the already completed levels is far too little to really warrant leniency there.",

            "review_text": "After about 50 minutes of gameplay, I think I can safely recommend this game. It's a pretty basic little game that is more suited to a mobile app store, but I wouldn't say that makes it necessarily out of place on the PC. It's becoming a bit grindy as I go on, but I've only completed 11 stages so far, and I've only failed a stage once. I do like the matching aspect though, in that you match specific gems together in order to put specific troops on the battlefield.  The aspects I don't like is how the game gives you hints about what gems you can match after only about 1-2 seconds of you not making a move. Usually the hint it gives you isn't even the best combination in order to put the most troops out on the field. Past that, there doesn't seem to be any incentive to max a level with a 3-star rating, as your ratings don't unlock any extras in the game, or anything like that.  All in all, it's a decent mobile-platform game, and it's FTP, so why not? 7/10",

If they want people to donate then they would have to develop a more complex game.  I've passed all current 60 levels in around 10-12 hours.  If they made this PVP, with castles to capture and lands\\territory to hold, and also if you could equip units with armor and add the raid bosses, then this game could develop into a nice MMO RPG.  Cool game though. Very nice one to kill time if you are bored.  PS i passed this game with ZERO donations. Just upgrade you coin drop from the start to 60 and upgrade you archers damage first and you'll pass the game. Then when you will get more units  Set up to Use:  Swordsman(upgrade hp\\def first) + Archers(upgrade only damage first) + Eagle Warrior(upgrade dam\\hp first) + Walock(upgrade heal first) +Royal Guard(upgrade hp first) + Wizard(upgrade damage only)  If you use the above set up.. you will pass all levels without much problem. Unless there is a dead end on playing board then just restart and you will pass any level on 2-3 try.  REMEMBER TO UPGRADE YOU COIN DROP COUNT AT LEAST TO 90",

            "review_text": "More Reviews @  TheVideogameBacklog.com   Battle for Blood came to my attention when I was fixing up a computer for a friend and I was setting it up to have something that their grand-kid could play as opposed to playing flash games and downloading viruses from various websites. Thus Steam was downloaded and some FTP games were installed.  I’m a fairly decent fan of Match-3 games in as much as they are more blatantly time-wasters more so than your usual games are. A lot of games will try to give you a deep story where in Match-3 games, the stories are pretty bland and used more as filler between and explaining why the levels exist in the order they do. Battle for Blood is basically the same thing with a mild twist.  With so many Match-3’s out there, if you are to make a new one and want it to compete, you’ll have to do something different. What Battle for Blood does is reward you in real-time with units for the fight you are currently engaging in above the Match-3 board. The bigger the match, the larger the number of units are brought into the field. You’ll probably encounter some super BS baddies, but give it time and you’ll end up with some of your own. The flip-side of the coin is that there are “penalties” to using said powerful units… well for you. The computer just does whatever it wants.  As you progress you gain access to more powerful units, however there is one more thing you need to pay attention to. Each unit has a cost (which also corresponds to the rate at which their pieces will appear on the board). More powerful units cost a lot less, but you’ll still have to send a level specific amount of units onto the field. Weaker units will fill this need quicker since they have a higher cost. The more powerful units won’t fill this bar much at all. That means to get up to the level specific amount of units, you’ll have to bring more troops. That also means there are more tiles on the board and it will be harder to create large matches or matches at all really. You’ll have to decide if the cost is worth the benefit, and sometimes it is. I didn’t like taking more than 4-5 units in if I didn’t have to.  With each round won or lost, you’ll gain money. You’ll be using this to upgrade many aspects of each troop individually. This is where the grind can come in. Some levels will be designed as difficulty barriers. You’ll probably have to try some of these levels a few times. Some have complained about the grinding in this game, however they have obviously never played a game with real grinding ala Monster Hunter. That said, sometimes upgrading your troops doesn’t guarantee victory. I’ve simply played a level a time or three and suddenly the RNG was with me and I straight wrecked the level that previously trounced me. Whatever works I guess, right?  Score Gewd./Tasty!  While Battle for Blood does slap you with RNG, it at least isn’t taking math lessons from X-Com. There is some grinding to be found, but it’s really nothing to be worried about since the core concept of the game is rather fun. If you’re having a rough go about the game, mix up your picks. I tended to stick with the low-cost units, healer and one big DPS/tank. Remember that a smaller, but stronger army is better. The only other thing that can get frustrating is earning three starts because it tends to rely on the amount of things you kill. If you don’t get three stars, stay until you do. It’ll be harder if you have to come back with stronger units. If you do well, you can probably destroy all the content in about ten hours. That’s more than some time I’ve spent in games that cost me money. If you enjoy Match-3 games, you have no real excuse for not playing Battle for Blood. I am waiting for the additional content that Battle for Blood says is coming.",

You upgrade your army with gold after each battle, there is an option to buy the 'coins' instead of grinding for them. The game flows smooth with no real grinding up until you hit your first stop. for instance if you lose to many 'camps' the games version of lives you are forced to wait a real world time limit. Those are pretty much the only negatives I can think of, or have experienced at this time. overall it seems like a decent, if really simple game, its not that bad.   EDIT: Another note, it is pay to win,, if you buy coins you will do better, however its only a single player game so you don't actually lose anything from not paying except time.",

Other signs that this game is top-notch: The 2nd button on the first screen takes you to the Android store to buy it.  The 3rd button takes you to the Windows Phone store to buy it.  Game sometimes wont register that you won, so the level wont end and you have to restart the game.  If too many units are on screen, the message 'Please Waiiting' appears' The first special move in the game says to 'Swipe the screen' to activate it. Game is made in Unity, the engine for people who dont know how to make videogames.   Its clearly a game made for cellphones, but to be fair the game is fun, if somewhat easy so far. I like the game and think it should serve as a decent time waster if you are bored and want something cute to play for a bit.

NOW comes the bad part: The learning curve is artificial, as is the difficulty. I mean, the enemies sometimes spawn at a moderate pace, but then suddenly BOOM 10-20 enemies on top of each other and your units can't do anything about it. Even if you manage to spam some out with Archers you get some superficial BS that gets you a defeat because they needed an 'easy' way to want you to pay money for this PoS port of a mobile 'match the tiles' game.  The grammar needs to be checked over again, doesn't matter if English isn't your first language because you can at least hire someone that has it as their first language.  THEN the upgrades: They're VERY negligable at most. Even when I fully upgraded a few units they were STILL getting mowed over quite easily so NOTHING actually improves on the units at all it seems. Bug? Nah, I think it's just a way for them to be lazy.  It's a lazily designed game by lazy developers that want to try and make a quick buck off of people who are ignorant to the fact that while the game is free they try to hook you in by make the game artificially difficult.",
