            "review_text": "It’s not fair to say that the darkness consumed me, for it was I who enveloped myself in it, there was no coercion involved, only my own maddened curiosity. Another Postal game was released? Well, the second one was charming in that somewhat difficult to explain way that not very good games sometimes are, and it was on sale for a tenner, what could I possibly lose? Sometimes in the quiet hours of the night, when it seems not even God is there to hear me, I ask myself what I could have saved had I never clicked ‘Add to Cart’. It’s more than the ten dollars, what I lost that day transcends the mere balancing of a checkbook, when I played this game the concepts of love, of faith in my fellow man, the very knowledge of any pleasures I had once known all fled from me in an instant.   I wish I could chalk my dislike of this game up to the awful controls, the movement clunkier than a 50’s movie robot or the aiming that I can only describe as ‘acrid’, like the breath of a drunken pirate manning the cannons of his schooner, the fearsome ‘Nobody Will Ever Love You’. I can’t though, much like an iceberg made of solid human feces it goes much deeper than the surface problems. I didn’t even come across anything that offensive in my two-hour waterboarding session with Postal 3, I know that’s exactly what it’s meant to do, and it succeeds with a lot of people, but it just fell flat. The limp and lifeless writing, which is exactly what it permanently rendered certain parts of my body, is the most grotesque thing here aside from the animations and cutscenes. All of this combines to form some sort of chimera of awful design that leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth that has nothing to do with the attempted gross out humor involving vacuum cleaners and AIDS infected cats.   In the end, it all just tries so hard to elicit some kind of response, positive or negative, from the player, but much like God on the day this game was released, it simply left me feeling apathetic.",

A couple new weapons are a real winner (badgersaw, beehive) and the missing anthrax infected cow heads and missing taliban WMD rocket launcher is a real bummer. Half the fun I have with Postal 2 is the AFFECT of a biological agent trap or the automatic spreading of sick on a populace as postal dude stands by, innocent. I missed people running up to stop near me and say 'I...' only to begin vomiting blood and die - because of some devious mischief I had nothing at all to do with, I promise. Postal III lacks this depth of game play. It is somewhat linear. Not completely on rails, but not free. But when you've got Ron Jeremy, Sarah Palin, Gary Coleman's face, Osamma Bin Laden, homo cowboy thegway biker gangs, Krotchy and all the racism and political jokes you could ever want just waiting for you...you would be cheating yourself to not at least give this game a try.

I have not encountered any that are breakable to the story but more a laughing matter. But they do not overall detract from the humorous gameplay and storyline behind the the sadley aged source engine used. However the good/bad moral alignment can be a little difficult as some missions require you to be bad to complete them. Again, not a major issue for somebody willing to take the time to look past these issues and play it in the same thought as the prequels. Even the controls feel the same. A fun romp through a wild story filled with cursing and blood spurts so over the top you would think they were made to look that way. Hell, you can craft a gun that shoots a cat off it by its butt hole!!! Running with scissors, you have done a good job in all the harsh remarks this game brought with it. Although an ingame map would have been handy...... Still much of the game to play, but first impressions are good. Graphics: 6-7. Gameplay: 7. Overall: 7",

The graphics are the best, the new weapons are fun, missions are fun and interesting and actually require some thought, and don't even get me started on the soundtrack.

Cons: Is loaded with bugs, the occasional load screen freeze, So Save often.   Other than the bugs, its a good game to kill time, and if your looking for a good laugh, buy it.  Is it worth the $20? Not really, best to buy it when it goes on sale.",

It's broken all the way down to the achievements. It's extremely linear and the 'free roam' maps are small as hell. when you initially play, your like wtf did I just play, but then, you play the good side of the story. -- I even hate to say this but the good story version of the game seemed to be more of a overall game, even the boss fights were actually boss fights to an extent...    (the ending was actually pretty epic with the tank battle)     The fact that this alone allows you to draw out the gameplay factor a bit does kind of give it a replay value... Kind Of.... This is when 17 levels actually becomes 27 levels and you actually kinda feel bad for the game, because you start to see it's potential..... This is when you really want to give it   At Least a 7/10   but ... you know it's   really a 5/10   and you can't recommend it to anyone because it's very incomplete....  ____   5/10   ____  Maybe someday a team will come along and fix it.",

The missions make no sense, the enemies are either too stupid to kill you; or, kill you in mere seconds without any chance of you doing anything about it.   The game runs at a staggering, mindblowing, ten frames per seconds at nearly all times. The voice acting is atrocious, the NPCs could not be any more vapid and shallow. The guns are unsatisfying, and most of the other weapons are just plain stupid and have no purpose other than shock value.   I can't wrap my mind around how this 'game' ever got the green light to get this far. Please, only consider installing this 'game' if they pay you to do so. Stay away from this distasteful, poor designed 'game' that was clearly made by immature ten-year-olds. Because, no matter how you slice it, it was clearly targeted for them, too.
