            "review_text": "So, I played this entire game through from start to finish. I was really looking forward to playing this game, because I am a fan of the actual roleplaying game. To say the least, I was thoroughly disappointed.   The game suffers from lighting errors early in the game, which already establish a bad image for the rest of the game. The annoying lighting errors aside, the actual graphics of the game aren't horrible, but aren't impressive either. I recall some texture errors on armors, in which a glitchy texture covered the entire armor set. In addition, I also recall many of the armor models being reused, so quite a few of the armor sets look the same.   The actual game play is accurately described in the description as, 'hack and slash', so I can't complain about the mostly tedious game play. There really isn't much room for character development, which is limited to four different classes, each with a set race. I will however say that despite limitations, the concept of leveling up, and upgrading your equipment, is what keeps the game playable.   As for the actual storyline, I won't spoil any of it, but I will say that in my opinion, the storyline isn't satisfying and the final boss fight is nothing short of frustrating and redundant (and for me, one of the lowest points of the game).   If all of the bugs were fixed, and there was more room for character development, then with some expansions onto the actual content (like maybe a sandbox mode or more of a storyline, because the actual game is very short), then this game would be a decent game. However, at its current phase, I cannot say I would recommend it, and overall I was disappointed.",

Gamespy does not exist so multiplayer is out of order. The sound may not work at all. This game does not support 1080p resolutions.   I finished this game once, not long after it was released. It is a sub-par game. Its controls and camera are badly done for pc. The games difficulty comes from the lack of control the player has over his own character. The plot is thin and the enermies respawn too fast. The whole game is very monochrome. Even if you can get the game working you will miss out on multiplayer. This is yet another game that fails to do D&amp;D well.",

The graphics are very dated, and though skills and things look fun, trying to play this with a mouse and keyboard seems like they didn't really want it played that way.",

The combat is simple and straightforward, at times too easy and other times kinda challenging (depends on level,enemies and numbers). Multiplayer and more world/areas/dungeons is what would have made this game a lot more fun.  pros: simple hack &amp; slash combat   cons: no in-game chat to communicate , short game without much replayability.",

It plays and looks like a sort of single character version of Dungeon Siege but even then doesn't have that classic feel. I would rather reload Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna than play this anymore. If Steam had an Amazon-like section 'Game for Laptops' it might belong there.....",

It feels like it'sa game that's been in Alpha testing and then they've just decided to release it as a joke.  The game advertises it's 4-player co-op, however you are unable to connect to any Multiplayer games. There is absolutely no options in the lobby so you just have to sit and wait, and hope someone else can connect to your game. Trying to join someone elses game presents the same issues. I can only imagine that the game is so horrible no-one else is playing it.  So stuck playing 1P. First item I received was a helmet. I equipped it, and it had no textures. The controls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The 'cutscenes' that tell you what's supposed to be going on in the game are jerky and disjointed. Sound = horrible. When you click the button the guy swings his weapon. This is about the only thing that actually works.  This is just about the worst game I've ever played. $15 down the drain...",

Instead of actually having voiced lines, someone decided to just give all the conversing characters grunts instead of actual words. Textures in the game kept failing on me and the only reason I bothered beating it was... well I don't know.   Random loot drops is the *only* thing the game had going for it. Nothing else. This is definitely one of those 'play and uninstall as quickly as possible' types of games. Don't even bother looking back.  Rating: 2/5 (Just barely)",
