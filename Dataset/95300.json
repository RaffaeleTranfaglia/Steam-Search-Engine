            "review_text": "Well, what a wonderful game. Honestly, got is a part of indie humble bundle. Thought I'd try it out because was quite bored. And it turned out to be my favourite game of the year as of now.  AS a 2D platformer it is quite demanding on your system - however nothing an average system can't manage (integrated graphics cards tend to have little support and in that regard run the game quite sluggishly. if you've got a separate gpu then it's gonna run smoothly). Nonetheless personally I think it's a beautiful game, even stunning. Mechanics are great - very enjoyable fighting, nice variety of weapons available and they all feel different too (a bit too 'soft' and 'smooth' for heavy guns like a rocket louncher or so, but it's futuristic plasma rounds that you're firing so I think it reflects on that well). Many different kinds of opponents that you will have to figure out how to kill, so it's not too much of a straight 'shoot em up' platformer.  Where this game really excels is its soundtrack. The atmosphere it creates is simply... breathtaking. As a part of bundle I received it separately as mp3, and am listening to in on a regular basis - it's that good. You will quickly notice that this game is not lengthy. Still it leaves plenty of room for prolongued gameplay, especially if you like picking up achievements and accomplishing everything to perfection.  To round up, as mentioned I was so blown away by this game - gameplay, soundtrack and (forgot to mention) story wise. Definetely pick it up if you're a platformer fan (imho it doesn't redefine the genre in any way - however it does show that it's still got that kick), and, well, even if you're not. I guarantee you will not be let down.",

Some puzzles turn unsolvable if you made some mistake during the sometimes lengthy levels (level 11 I'm looking at you). Floaty controls that for some weird reason work better with mouse/keyboard than controller...for a platformer!  Shame really :/",

            "review_text": "Capsized is a game with good ideas, but numerous design issues.  The game features a cosmonaut on a green planet fighting green aliens against a green backdrop and behind green vines. Yes, it is as cluttered as it sounds. The main menu, which consists of white text on a white background (which thankfully scrolls to other colours so you can actually read the text) gives you a good idea of what the rest of the game is going to be like. Eventually, you get used to it, but the developers do not seem to understand that 'good graphics' doesn't just mean nice looking textures. You have to use contrast as well. Draw the players attention to important things, don't hide it in a field of clutter.  The vsync option in the game also does nothing (at least on the Linux version, anyways), and has no frame limiting. In other words, no matter how slow or how fast your computer is, you will have loads of screen tearing. I switched to windowed mode since I have my window manager (Compiz) set to vsync windowed programs whether they like it or not. I then discovered that the game doesn't try to keep your mouse in the window, so be prepared to accidentally click outside of the game a lot.  Moving on to actual gameplay, the idea of using a grappling 'hook' to swing around a low gravity environment and toss enemies around sounds great, but it behaves very strangely mechanically. Shooting a grappling hook horizontally into a wall somehow manages to let you move upwards? I also found the ability to stick to walls was preventing me from moving where I wanted to go instead of helping me.  The are some other minor issues that could have easily been fixed had more rigorous testing been done. For example, many of your weapons cause splash damage that does very high damage to you if you're too close to where it hits. There are also rapid fire weapons that fire while you hold down the mouse button. When you expend all the ammuniton in one weapon, it automatically switches you to another weapon, firing it if the mouse is currently down. See the problem?  Oh, and the game freezes when you try to exit it, so there's that too.",

Grab the demo and play through a level or two multiple times to see how this game can provide hours and hours of entertainment. Add on the Bonus Modes and you have some great staying power.

Oh, and it can be used for climbing...but so can your jetpack. Redundant, I know.  There's no story aside from some pictures to start levels. Levels all look basically the same.  All the enemies seem to be animal-like in their nature, so why there are weapons laying everywhere I don't understand. They're kind of dumb too. Every one has specific patterns and once you figure them out you'll shoot from a distance to avoid attacks. Some enemies at the end get a bit stupid to counter this tactic. For example, one enemy creates its own gravity well to pull everything in, including your photon blasts, and somehow the live ammo and shots don't damage it, but get shot back to you after a time.  This game gets great reviews on Steam, but it didn't blow my skirt up. It's also short. I beat it in a couple of hours. Fun enough for a night, but at about level 8 of 12 I was ready for the game to be done.",

The story is simple and straight forward, assigning a different task to each mission with all having the ultimate goal of escaping the strange alien planet you find yourself on. The gameplay itself is fun and offers a variey of ways of movement between wall jumping, hook shotting and jetpacking when you have the fuel. There are a varity of weapons to choose from each having their own unique way of attacking. The enemies also vary from simple hostile primitive creatures to the more advanced aliens which range from grunts with guns to tough guardians with magical abilities. The environment is eerie and intrigues a sense of curiosity and exploration. Probably my favorite part about the game though, is the soundtrack. It fits incredibly well with the lost spacey feel of the game and will have you googling for the artist before the game is through. All in all, this game really impressed me and has been one of the most delightful games I have played in the past year.

            "review_text": "Don't make the mistake I did and think that Capsized is some kind of exploration-heavy metroidvania thing. The mentions of exploring and using tools to navigate might suggest that, but it's a very different beast. What you're getting is a floaty sci-fi platformer with a lot of shooting, a lot of physics puzzles, and a lot of frustration. And it might just be short enough to finish before you get fed up with it.  Capsized sees you stranded on an alien world that wastes no time trying to waste you. The natives are restless and the fauna is deadly, and most levels are going to be spent depopulating the area so you can accomplish your goal. Instead of big, sprawling areas, Capsized takes place in fairly compact levels, each one starting you from scratch and tasking you to search high and low for weapons, jetpack fuel, extra lives, and other power-ups. I must emphasize, nothing is carried over between campaign missions, leaving each of the 12 levels feeling a bit thin.  There's not a lot to do besides kill things, collect power-ups if you're having trouble killing things, and finish the level. Sometimes you need to reach a certain point, sometimes you need to collect doodads, and sometimes you really do just have to kill a bunch of stuff. Navigating the levels to do that might prove difficult, as your spaceman is very floaty and easy to send flying. He can wall jump almost effortlessly, grapple things with a grappling beam, and jetpack around, all with mounting momentum that can easily get unmanageable.  You'll be shoving and grappling plenty of blocks, too, because Capsized loves physics puzzles. It feels odd calling them physics puzzles, though, because it's usually just a tunnel blocked with junk or a pressure plate that needs to be held down. Finishing said 'puzzles' is another source of frustration, since the stones and boxes use the same physics as you and can easily drift away or rocket off the screen. The worst is when you're expected to use a block as a shield against the game's incredibly lethal traps, watching your spaceman get perforated as the block he's holding wobbles around lazily.  Dying is very much the low part of the game, and it comes more and more frequently the further in you get. Enemies and especially traps can do tons of damage, and as they become more dense in the later levels it gets that much harder to avoid big chunks of hurt. When you die you either respawn at the last 1-up you collected OR the start of the level, which is infuriating in the more maze-like levels. Several of your best guns also do splash damage to you, and there are plenty of little critters that love to run up and attach to your face to catch mortars for you.  The art is fantastically detailed, but becomes a bit too busy for a game like this. Sound design is nice and somber but the effects in battle, both audio and visual, are sorely lacking. There's so little impact to weapons you'll never really know how much damage is being done until your enemy (or you) is dead. A few co-op and arcade modes round out the game but the fact is that you're getting a 12-mission campaign that can be beaten in two hours, provided it doesn't make you rage. And whether it be the giant boulder that just will not get out of your way, or the jetpack sniper that runs you out of lives, something will most likely make you jump ship early.",

There are a bunch of little niggling flaws, including uninspired controlling, uninspired mapping and even more uninspired secret finding (they are called secrets for a reason, guys, not 'mementos with hidden pathways!'). BLOODY SCREEN appears when your character is about to die, and instead of pairing it with regenerating health, the screen stays there until you find a health kit, making navigation a bit of a ♥♥♥♥ing pain. All that, and at two-three hours, the game still feels like it's trying to pad itself out. So it's got that Quake 1 action feel but it's about as interesting as Quake 2. Try the demo first.",

I love the graphics, music, animations, weapons, aliens, and just about EVERYTHING (aside from the slightly lightweight campaign).

All u told is that ship die and u land on planet. Hella stupd.   The art is terrible I asked Jenny and she said she drew better drewings then this all the time.   And don't even get me started on the title. You are NOT ONCE fitted for a cap in this game. Seriously, if you're going to make a game about being stranded in a planet inhabited by ferocious and bloodthirsty aliens, give it a name that doesn't give an impression of learning how to tell your cap size. Maybe something like 'alien attak' or something like that.   I give this game a ( ∫ (x²)dx with the domain of [0, 2] ) / 4",
