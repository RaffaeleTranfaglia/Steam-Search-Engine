This game really impressed me.To be honest, I haven't played much of the other Sherlock Holmes game yet (I'll do so soon) so I cannot compare this to its prequels. So I simply say what I think of this game standing on its own.  The typical adventure elements (combining items, etc.) are reduced, it's all about the case and how you proceed. Finding clues, talking to people, doing experiments to test theories, check your archives - that's all you do in order to solve the case. There are six different cases in total which are not connected, although there is a small side story line that will resolve in the finale (Don't worry, I won't spoil more) You play as Sherlock, occasionally as Dr. Watson and as their dog Toby. Each case has its own unique characters, its own story and background information. From Baker Street to Scotland Yard and the crime scenes you visit a lot of different locations which are all very well designed. This game sure has one of the best level designs I've ever seen - you really feel the heart the developers put in each location. The character design is outstanding as well - just look at the faces. Choosing Unreal Engine 3 was the right decision.  Well, what else to say? If you like adventure games, cinematic games like TellTale's games (The Walking Dead, Wolf among us) with more actual gameplay and logical thinking this game is just meant for you. As a Sherlock Holmes fan this is a must-buy game anyway.   It is elementary to buy this game I'd say!",

            "review_text": "I was worried I had overrated the game myself when I bought it on only a small discount, since I enjoy detective genre so much. Did enjoy the * hearts * out of this game.   You play Sherlock Holmes in 1st or 3rd person depending on what you pick (can be changed with the push of a button). The full story has 6 cases, each independent. So independent the game deleted your save files when you move onto the next case. This is really only a problem if you missed some achievement on your first playthrough.   I thought the game would have a clear answer to every case, but not so. You have to guesstimate from the clues you're found. You can then make a conclusion out of several possible clue-paths you want to go with. You -can- check if you're gone with the correct solution if you really need to and want the achievement for getting all right. There's also a moral-meter depending on if you want to condemn or absolve the murderer. Either way does not seem to matter for the game experience other than that the condemned/absolved person will write you a letter. You also have the option to not play a case through completely, just conclude with a few clues to end the case quickly, if you for some reason should choose to do so.  Graphics are pretty decent, the environment looks amazing and the people look realistic enough to look like wax-figures, sound and music are decent and I liked all the voice actors for their roles.   A few nuisances with 'GTFO MY WAY, WATSON' as he's mostly always following you and if you walk in somewhere and re-decide and want out, Watson will be there blocking your way. If you run into him he will look surprised for a second, then slowly take one step back and you'll have to run into him again for another step back until you can move out. Luckily most areas where this might happen have two exits so you'll never be completely stuck, but the other exit will probably not be a shortcut.   Achievement are easy to 100% though it might take you more than one playthrough unless you really tryhard with an achievement guide as you play.  Replay value is low, though it does exist should you want to come to another conclusion to a case, because you need the achievements, or you want to ♥♥♥♥ off some suspects or Mycroft and read their letters afterwards.  Important: HOLD SHIFT TO RUN. Took me too long to realize. Control maps are for noobs.",

The deduction system is the best it's ever been and the cases are, overall, fairly interesting. The game is looking great and the mechanics hold no mystery, everything is intuitive.  Something a bit annoying are the loadings. There's plenty of them and they aren't that fast. While it isn't a major complaint, it's a nuisance.  As game the progresses on a case-by-case basis it leaves room for expansions containing more and i really hope Frogwares is thinking about it. I could play some more cases!  So, if you are a fan of the series you will probably enjoy more Sherlock Holmes. If you are new to the series, this instalment is the most beginner friendly and might pull people to the series. For me, it's recommended.",

I have earlier played The testament of Sherlock Holmes and there are some differences between them. In Crimes &amp; Punishments it's more like a crime case solving game where you find clues, interview people and have to decide which of the suspects are guilty based on what you have found. Every crime case is unique with their unique story. The game feels actually closer to L.A Noire on some points when it comes to this new gamestyle.  In the previous game, The testament of Sherlock Holmes, it was more like a linier puzzle solving adventure game.  The game is stable and I didn't have any bugs or issues with it. The only annoying was the lack of custom control. First time I started the game it wanted to use my gamepad as controller and I did not find any options to pick mouse &amp; keyboard instead. I had to start the game with my gamepad unplugged to play with mouse &amp; keyboard.   The only big downside in this game really is the lack of cases. 6 cases total and it took about 16 hours for me to complete. I did not rush through it nor skipped any content that could be skipped/fast-forwarded. For almost 40€ I think it should have been more cases to solve. I think 30€ would have been a more acceptable price. Still it's a good game and well worth to buy it on a Steam sale.",

I feel like the game aids the player a bit too much at times: like telling you when to use the super sight and do the re-enactments. Combining clues is rather forgiving, and results often in just smashing through to the right choice.

The story is very loose, it's basically just six unrelated crimes that Sherlock Holmes sets about solving for various different reasons, but that allows you to just concentrate on the actual fun of solving the crimes instead of worrying about what little plot there is. Each crime is well constructed and allows you a lot of leeway in terms of how you go about solving it, and plenty of freedom to make all the wrong choices/deductions/conclusions etc.   The biggest downside is probably the frequent dashing back and forth between locations, necessitating loading screens of Holmes and Watson sitting reading in their carriage. You can review the crimes during this period but I imagine most players would probably just sit waiting for the 'click to continue' button.  At the end of each case you can replay it and see how things could have worked out different based on making different deductions from the clues you gather. While there is always a 'correct' answer, you get freedom in what you do with that information, and one of the funnest parts of the game is agonizing over whether to condemn a suspect, let them get away with it, or do your best to reduce the severity of their punishment.

Witness questioning can be fun, but in the 4 hours I was able to withstand this excessive boredom, I had 2 witness interviews, and 1 crime scene inspection. Everything else were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzles:  'Chemisty' puzzle rules: Blue reagent must be second after the first reagent. Orange reagent must be the third before first reagent. First reaget must be the fourth after the second reagent that is the first before Blue reagent, but after fifth reagent before Orange reagent which is second after the first before third.

The theater ticket is very expensive. Must have sold the cow to buy it!  10/10 most legit detective simulator 1887-2015.  None of these dumb puzzles are put into the game for any real purpose other than stalling player progress, making the game seem longer than it is. On top of that their descriptions have been completely nonsensical so far and had nothing to do with the solution.  Witness: Soul Suspect is a better detective game than this. A lot better. Because there you are actually doing detective job for 90% of the game. Hell, Deus Ex HR and MD have more 'detective' gameplay than this.",

            "review_text": "This game was definetely a step in the right direction for the Sherlock Holmes franchise though it was by no means perfect. What made this game stand out the most was the way you were actually compelled to see through Sherlock's eyes, a tactic that BBC's Sherlock uses by instead of Sherlock constantly telling us what he observes, we are given descriptive words next to clues and characters. This game also made a good use of the way players can connect clues and form their own opinions of who was responsible for the many cases and even what form of judgement to pass.  This game is perfect for those people that are sick of being tied down to the strict plot set by most detective/search games such as previous Sherlock Holmes or even Nancy Drew games. The players are given some level of freedom in deciding what certain clue associations mean and for some cases are given the option to sentance a person, without informing the player that there are more clues yet to be found. I actually found myself completely imersed in this game and was impressed with the graphics.  There were a few downsides to this game, mostly the overall plot. I understand that this game was to focus on smaller cases but at the same time the writers attempted to make us care about this underlying issue involving a group of anarchists who threatened Great Britian's stability. However the group was not referenced for me to pay much attention and when the group finally became of some importance to one of the cases. I couldnt have cared less.  Another downside was the third person view though the first person view was waaaay better than the previous games. The third person view was clunky and awkward and I actually got kind of dizzy playing through the first case in this view. The camera angles just didn't support the game very well.  Lastly, this is something that doesn't really affect the overall game experience but after I played through the game I couldn't help but feel what the point of having Watson was except to have someone to tag along, occasionally get in the way, and for one or two cases actually lend some form of assistance. In many cases and locations Watson would actually stand off to the side and would not follow Sherlock, which anyone playing the previous games would understand why (Watson is always behind Sherlock). However, what made the Sherlock Holmes mysteries and series so great was not only his view and how he solved cases but how Watson percieved Sherlock. It just felt like the one missing element.    ",

I also would have liked a more open area to explore, rather than just a courtyard or a small street.   +graphics  +unique case solving methods  +multiple endings/possibilities per case  +classic sherlock humor    -lip syncing  -lack of deep story/connection  -restricted/small explorable areas throughout the game  -long loading screens   8.5/10",

I love this game so much that I just purchased the previous sherlock holmes game that came out made by the same company a couple years prior which is pretty identical in terms of gameplay.  If you like mystery sort of things or games this is a must buy.  CON:  My only thing I'm kinda disappointed with is that from what I have read they don't plan on doing any DLC (more cases). This is the sort of game that seems like they could make a fortune adding more cases over time but I guess maybe they wanna put their efforts totally into their next sherlock holmes game which is fine by me.",

You shouldn't consider this game to be a real mental challenge, there's a lot of hand-holding, but that's not a bad thing. Sometimes I get stuck in these puzzle games on the most obscure clue and it's infuriating. The same goes for the mini-games, they're not very hard either but an appropriate level of fun (and you can always skip them). In an age where I've got like 10 unplayed games in my Steam library, I don't really feel like taking a lot of time to click the mouse in the *exact* right position or whatever.  The graphics are really great too, and you can really tell that the devs put in a phenomenal effort to make a great game. There is a lot of depth here that you may not always expect.  One gripe: the movement system is a little wonky, could be improved. Sometimes it's hard to know where/how to walk through a map.",

For fans of the stories, it's a great reimagining. I can't say for sure if it will impress those who aren't familiar with Doyle's books but simply like adventure games, but I think it ought to work for both kinds of players.  As with any adventure game, there are occasional snags where you think the elements are uncovered but the game requires one more tiny nudge to prove that you've understood. Those rare occasions can be a little frustrating, but aside from that it's a very polished indie game with a lot to recommend it. Some people have complained that they weren't entirely sure if they'd got the right man/woman at the end of each case - if that happens to you, you probably haven't solved the crime correctly. I think it's good that the game allows you to get it wrong without telling you plainly, and only shows you that you were right if you were right, but not everyone will see that as a strength.",

Game avoids the modern adaptations that depicts Holmes as an action hero. Holmes was a good boxer, and practiced 'Baritsu,' but was known for his detective skills. Understandably, some gamers might not appreciate that. Bad: Some of the mini-games are disappointing, and Blood Bath halfway through makes you feel like a dull version of Indiana Jones, not Holmes.
