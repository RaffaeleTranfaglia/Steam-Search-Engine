It was worth the laughs of everyone in the room with HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS and my bumbling reations before ragequitting in the tutorial!  I honestly thought I was going be playing an Aerobiz type game and instead was greeted with one of the most confusing, USER-UNFRIENDLY game I have ever seen.  If your tutorial alone causes confusion as to what to do next and then causes rage quits, THEN YOU HAVE MADE A TERRIBLE GAME!  Also... WHY DO I HAVE TO REGISTER WITH SOME OTHER BS LAUNCHER TO PLAY A GAME I GOT ON STEAM!?!?  The voiceovers are terrible, the art is terrible, the user interface is considered a form of torture in most the civlized world.  I don't even think the people that made this know anything about airplanes... I don't even think they have ever flown on an airplane before!",

            "review_text": "While I kind like the artstyle of this game (brings me back to the good old days of playing Theme Park World), it's sadly the only thing I liked about this game besides one other thing. I'm quite into sim games in general, but this game really did not cut it for me.  In this game you play a cartoonish airline manager (there are a few to choose from, each with their own special trait like getting better deals at on-flight meals) and you have to be the most succesful one: aka be the most profitable. You buy planes for your fleet and customize to your liking, balancing airplane quality, fly range, maintenance and transport size. You can also buy plance from the scrapyard, which is a nice touch but I doubt beneficial due to very high maintenance and the planes often being too outdated (yes, planes technology evolves in this game). You have to get your crew together (balancing skills versus salary), arrange stuff for you planes, etc.  But in the end there is one mayor issue: the game is TERRIBLY slow. You (and your competitors) advance at the speed of a snail... While this does resemble real life better, it sadly just isn't fun. This combined with a very steep learning curve as the tutorial just doesn't cut it, causing me to feed that I really have no idea what I'm doing nor what I ought to do. And that's bad for a sim game. You should have the feeling that your decision matters and you should get feedback on the consequences of you choices. But sadly, it takes too long to get that feedback and if easy to miss it as the gains are often very small.  This game disappointed me. If your time is valuable to you, try some other game instead of this one. Or be willing to ask google to help you play this game, because without it you'll surely fail :(",

That's about the best I can say about it. The game is laggy at times, glitchy at others, and all in all, just a big let down. I had better hopes for this game, since I do quite like the genre, but I quickly found myself just too bored with it in the longrun. While some people may like this game, I do not. Nor would I recommend it to others. Save your money, or purchase it as part of some deal if you must, but definitely avoid this one imo.",

The learning curve on this game is quite high and to be sucessful is more trial and error. Also having to 'walk' your avatar when the clock is ticking to different departments gets tedious and quite boring. The game has it's moments but there is something to be said about too much micromanagment. If your one to love Excel spreadsheets and plan in the future a love of how to manage an airline then this is the game for you. Other then that nothing about this game especially screams fun.",

            "review_text": "I really, really wanted to like this game. I got it off the Humble Bundle and wanted something nice that was a bit fancier than a facebook game. The end result? A mess.   Graphically, it isn't terrible. However, the carnage of steryotypes and cliches that end up nowhere and seemingly dead end gags will make your eyes bleed. They tried too hard to make a comical cartoonish game, and crashed into the state of 'slightly visibly better' than a Facebook game. I mean it does have  graphics[i/].  Gameplay wise, it is even  worse[i/]. Unless you personally developed this game, get ready for a steep learning curve....for all the wrong reasons. The tutorial refers to buttons not readily seen in some cases, or gets stuck, as a matter of example. In general play, there are buttons upon buttons and settings buried everywhere.   It really doesn't help, that they tried to be fancy in splitting the various management categories in different 'offices', for instance: assigning routes to planes is in a wholly different office from getting contracts and routes. (Not to mention routes are buried when playing in freeplay). Also who puts the painting for aircraft away from the hangar??!! I get that it is  design....but...why?  Why have another office????  Lastly, it is utterly boring yet incredibly hectic. There is an 8 hour day and everything happens at so fast you can barely finish getting an aircraft. In freeplay, there is literally not enough time to set up one route, for one aircraft, grab a crew (and if you purchased many aircraft you won't be given enough crew), design the aircraft, assign the aircraft. Where somehow, your competitors have several routes by the end of the day and are smoking you. The game, does become boring once the hecticness settles down. All you do then is stare at a screen and try to imagine planes flying.  Overall, this games gets a 4 cupcakes out of 10. Because I would only trade four for this which I hope was an indie game. It still needs polish.    ",
