            "review_text": "This game is pretty ridiculous. It's like the company asked a bunch of 4th graders to come up with ideas for a racing game, and this is the result. Wall rides, loops, huge jumps, crazy speed. It's awesome.  That being said, the skill cap is infinitely high. Yes, it's massively fun to go on a server and smash through a bunch of new tracks, crashing all over the place and hitting walls like they owe you money. And it's worth mentioning that since the multiplayer is almost exclusively user-created levels, there are tens of thousands of maps to play. But once you settle in to a server and have learned the maps, then it becomes a wonderfully technical game about shaving off bits of time where you can.  A notable game mechanic, for those unaware, is that in time attack mode (probably the most popular game type, that and Rounds) you can reset to the beginning of the track (or the last checkpoint) at any time. This is a bit of departure from many other racing games. You'll just have a set amount of time (usually 5 to 7 minutes), to get a single best run possible. This makes it so that you never have to waste time finishing a run when you've already messed up, you can just reset and start fresh immediately. Makes for a much more efficient practice regimen, and resulting rate of improvement.  There are three environments within TrackMania 2 (Stadium, Valley, Canyon), but within each environment is an abundance of variety in itself. Since this review is Stadium, I'll focus on that briefly: -Track materials: Pavement, Dirt, Grass, Water -Game Modes: Time Attack, Rounds. Probably others, but rarely used. RPG, I suppose. -Track Types: FullSpeed (because braking is for losers), Tech (because fullspeed is for neanderthals), Dirt (because you are full of self-loathing), Speedtech (Because you're a well-balanced individual with many friends and a winning smile).  Seriously, the infinite permutations of tracks alone makes this game worth it. The End",

            "review_text": "Trackmania 2 Stadium is a casual arcade racing game,like the Trackmania 1 series before it,it has a massive online following of players and modders,online leaderboards for country and region and an unlimited amount of tracks to race on,Trackmania 2 series is more of an updated version of the original game with a new graphics and sound engine,a more streamlined interface geared towards simplified ingame downloadable content and trying to combine the other expansions of the trackmania series together.  The old Trackmania games could be purchased as several different themes,sunshine,nations,united and forever,these were separate games with the same racing only set in different locals and racing car types,like F1 rally,exotic.There are also a few other versions on the game that combined everything together as one purchase called united nations.The original is old,it's pricing structure and layout was a mess but the game was very good in it's own right however it would never be recommended over the Trackmania 2 series these days.  Trackmania 2,so for the new updated game,it has now been split into three games,Stadium,Canyon and Valley -F1-STOCK-RALLY each of these games have their own locale and racing style,each of these games are superb in their own way and now these three games are tied together with the new menu system.The gameplay is very arcade,these games use for example the rally theme in a very loose sense to make up the look and sound of the game but overall,all three games are of the Trackmania style of gameplay,a gameplay all on it's own.  Gameplay consists of racing without racing !,you racing on the games tracks or the user created tracks that can resemble something from FZero or Micromachines or Hotwheels,you race simply for the race record and you race against your own and everyone else's ghost car,when you play online you are also racing against online players ghost cars,they are playing in real time but you can't crash into them as there is no collision,if there were collision then the game would simply not work as you can be racing along side as many as 400 other players at the same time of any given track !  This is a very casual pick up and play,have fun and turn off again game but it's also a very skillful game,also a very exciting game that looks and sounds great to boot,it doesn't matter what version of the game you buy,stadium canyon and valley all offer the same level of skill and fun.  So I would recommend everyone play this game,it's the PC racing game that everyone should own a copy of,I will break down the differences of each of the three games in preference as my opinion below.  Trackmania Stadium -You can't go wrong with stadium as it's the base game,the original and the best and has a f1 style car,and roads and track set similar to something like hot wheels and fzero,good traction on the road see's your car doing loop the loops and crazy wallrides,a very fast game and the number one choice over the other two.  Trackmania Canyon -The weakest of the three but it's really really fun,as good as the others but just not the best,however there is a certain amount of skill involved with canyon that pushes it further than vally and stadium,handling is similar to ridge racer making for very fast laptimes and the official trackmania contest finalists play canyon over the other two,i can understand why !   Trackmania Valley - the best looking of the three as it's engine was tweaked as the locale has more going on,more detail and simply just amazing looking ! Valley is the middle ground of the TM games,it feels more like stadium with more traction on the road,but ultra fast like canyon but doesn't offer anything really different apart from being an all round great game,however there are some other things about valley that do stand out and that's in it's level track design,the editor has a little more scope for making day and night time tracks,forrest tracks and underground tracks that can have you driving through mountains,i would say it's the middle ground and having all the of the best features of the two before it you would think it's the best of the bunch but it just isn't ! not a thing wrong with it but it still can't beat stadium.   I would always recommend Stadium as the starting game,it's the cheapest of the three and the core game is there,the other two are just as good but I would say Stadium is the best of the three,with stadium you do not even need to ever play the other two games,the other two are for those who can't get enough of the Trackmania series and it's also good to change out every now and then for something s bit different to race on.  CONS  The game like soo many others are not without problems,many bugs have already been sorted but I found the Trackmania series in particular to have some very backwards design ideas/flaws,for the most part this game and it's expansions will run 60fps+ on the very high graphical settings,some settings still slow it down like motionblur but thankfully you can turn all details from off,low,med,high,the vsync options are not very well explained as there are six options for vsync as well as triple buffering and first time users won't know the correct/best setup,I will say now that you should use vsync,also use every third frame (not constant frame) and also use triple buffer and this should give you a proper 60fps,water shader detail for medium pc's should be med or low,and motion blur would be recommended as off,there are many other options in the start up menu and you should take the time in setting these up,resolution is very important in this game,i found that lower resolutions are fine but you really miss the graphical details so I would recommend you aim for 1080,full frame rate with vsync options and then turn up other details to see what you can get away with.  Other problems with the game are the lack of support,this game is made by a French company and the forums and users are mostly EU users,there's not as many users from the uk and usa on the forums,that doesn't mean there are not many users from uk and usa playing the game,just means we try to avoid the unhelpful forums as I found I didn't get anywhere when asking for help.  The game's layout,the way the game works can be quite strange as well,you earn points for scoring high,these points are called Planets ? your planets are displayed in the top bar when you are in the main menu,these Planets are then used to buy online user created content,you earn a little planets each day that you play as well,another thing that seems backward to me is the apparent new menu system that combines everything together (it doesn't actually work) after all the time this game has been out it still is broken but since an update a month ago it is now working outside of steam but the steam version is still unworking,this means that if you own two or more of the trackmania games,you need to exit out the game and start then other one up from steam ( not a big deal really)  Overall this game is amazing,be prepared to spend some time on the game,take your time and mess about in the menus and try to get used to the way the Trackmania system works,playing the game for the first time gave me the feeling of (wtf have I just bought ?) it took me a while to understand the games charm,I was expecting far too much from the game and when I couldn't really GET the concept of the game along with the many problems I faced in trying to find out what Planets are and why my planets would disappear without buying content or sometimes I would buy content and lose my planets but not receive my item,I found it very hard in finding the answers on google or the mania forums,little things like this can really put you off a strange game and concept like this one,but give it a go and you will find it hard not to fall in love with this game,it's a classic reborn and in my opinion one of the best hardcore/arcade racers you can get !  10/10",

            "review_text": "Trackmania 2 Stadium is an arcade-like racing game with loops, jumps, and ridiculously fast speeds. I picked it up on a Steam sale for around $2.50 along with Trackmania Canyon for me and a friend because it was so cheap. There's a stripped down single player version: No story, no opponents (Except for the predeterminded time goasts), no collision. Just you and the road.  The multiplayer is the real reason why you would buy this game, though. The basis of multiplayer is that you have at set amount of time to finish the track and get the fastest time possible, while others are doing the same. There's a 'place' in that it's how you match up against other player's fastest times. It has an extensive server list, modding community, and track creators, and they're friendly!! Some actually say hello and strike a conversation when a new person joins. Because the game relies mostly on skill, professional racing teams have been created. I must say, server admins have a very good taste in music.  On the visual side, it looks very good, and because it's a reletively light game, you'll be running a pretty high FPS most of the time. You can also design your own vehicle skins, either the default car, or something from the Steam community. The modding community can let you race around the track as Sonic if you want.   The game itself can be pretty hard, to be honest. Many tracks require split second reaction time with very low margin for error. Don't be discouraged if you crash off the track a few times or if the pros get a faster time than you. Happens to the best of us. The more you play a track, the better you naturally get at it.  Overall, try to get it on a Steam sale. You might like it.  ",

Generally I like to play online in multiplayer on one of the full-speed beginner servers (which are impossibly difficult). Then if I hit a track in multiplayer that's good, I'll find a download for it on  tm-exchange.com  or a similar site. The track download process for this game is admittedly clunky, since it relies on third-party sites, but the community is gargantuan.  After downloading a new track I'll practice it until I can finally beat it. And occasionally back in multiplayer I'll see some track I know I've beaten, and I'll try it only to find out I've forgotten some of the subtleties of the track and have trouble even finishing. They are very challenging tracks, and best of all - continuosly new ones are being developed by a community that won't be going away any time soon.  Also, I only race using the keyboard for steering - so I suck. There's way more control from other controllers - but the game is decently playable with just the keyboard.",

This game will TEST YOU. It will test you to no end on your precision and how well you can powerslide without sending your car careening into a lampost. One you get it down, you can get that adrenaline rush that the whole of Sonic The Hedgehog wishes it could give you. Getting medals is also a challenge, even with the lower difficulty tracks. I just go for silver medals in single player, because the golds are basically MLG pro (At least they don't quickscope you the moment you get in the lead). The only problem I see with single player is currently, I don't think you can have multiple opponents to race against. Solo is 1v1 the whole way through (As far as I can tell). The physics are still what you'd expect from trackmania: go fast and you'll win, but you might wind up launching yourself off the track at that bump in the road or fly off at the next dip in the road and put yourself into a roll that costs you your silver medal.  Complimenting the challenge is the great aesthetics and performance. My computer runs this game at near perfect frames, and the vibrant color palette (DAT SKYBOX BE DOUBLE-D SEXY) makes the game pop.  This review is just based on my completion of all the white-flag challenges, so my experience can't say the same other players.  In the end, I say that this is a good installment in the Trackmania franchise, and worth my 20 bucks. I recommend you do what I did, and grab it before the Steam Winter Fail ends, or wait for the next discount on the franchise. Fans won't be disappointed (Maybe).",

Also there is always a way to make your time even slightly better. There is almost no perfect time. As in many games, people like to abuse a bug they find, which might at start may look unfair, but it gives many different ways to complete a track with. It makes more possibilities than normally.  One thing I really love about this game, is the track-editor. It's simple, fast and fun. Also, with mods like 'unlimiter', you don't have to worry about not being able to place a block, because it will allow it. Also, you can customize your car, and buy other cars, but they will not increase your speed or acceleration or anything like that. They're just a skin.  Most of tracks can be rather confusing, furious and enjoyable.  I seriously recommend this game to everyone who are into breaking times and wanting to compete with others. There are no one with a better and faster car than you, it's just about how you drive.  I really like this game, but I think some of bugs are annoying and fustrating, and should be fixed. I give this game 9/10, because you will fast get used to those bugs, and because this game is amazing in a competitive way.",

(More 3-dimensional than most racing games.) + Ranges from highly competitive to very casual. (Pick your poison.) + Custom tracks with the track editor. (Essentially a map editor, but with modular track 'blocks'.) + International sport. (Everywhere in the world competes.) + Countless tracks to race on. + Simple controls brings everyone into the racing.  + Customizable music playlists.  + Car painter (Click and drag mouse spraying on 3D object, WOW!)  Cons:  - None. Trackmania has been a favorite of mine for years, so it's only fair that I am biased.  Even if you aren't a big racing game fan, give this a shot. It has a lot of excitement and thrill to offer vs. other conventional racing games.

The track editor is fun as well. You can really make anything you want and race on it. Having Workshop support is great, too. I downloaded a few custom tracks from other users, and had a blast driving through it.  10/10. One of the best games I've purchased in a while.  My 3 year old loves watching my play this game, and it's actually a fun 'play time' for both of us. :) It's one of the only times I get to play games while being a responsible parent.  UPDATE: I've tacked on a bunch of additional time to this game, and I'm still blown away. It has gotten to the point where I'm sick of playing, but I can't stop. I just realized that once you get gold on a track, it let's you play the track again to record an 'official' score. I became the top player in my state on a few tracks at a harder difficulty. Seeing your name as #1 is quite rewarding.   The difficulty is another thing.... This game is hard! Very difficult in the later levels, and you have to get gold on everything to unlock the most challenging courses. Still working on that... I gotta admit that the first levels were pretty easy. But even as easy level becomes a challenge when you need to perfectly manuever every turn in the track to get the gold medal.  Anyway, buy this game if you haven't yet. It's worth the $10 (or whatever it is).",

Me)  From newbie's perspective: The game is quite challenging but not that hard. It's quite the satisfaction getting that shiny gold medal. The maps are pretty and thought out well - with fast straights and tight corners. Loopings and Wallruns make that racing game unique in its own way. Sometimes the maps can be quite confusing though - there are signs showing you where to go but instead you end up in a wall or out of the track. The game is simple enough and very fun. - My cousin  From my perspective: I played the open beta in 2013 for hours. I liked competing with other people and I even won some of the races. Well High School happened and I thought I was too 'old' for video games so I stopped playing. A year passed and I made a Steam account and started playing Trackmania Nations Forever. My family doesn't like video games at all so I wasn't allowed to buy Trackmania². Long story short - I bought it just 2 days ago. Trackmania² is like TMNF with a facelift. However the single player maps are a different story - those in Trackmania² are simply better. I like the underground block types Nadeo introduced and the double loops are fantastic. Some maps are very generic and remind me of TMNF but others always get me like 'Who came up with this sh*t???'. There are some things that bug me out though. Gold Medals are a joke - you can get them very easily (if you have played before) and for some reason the camera doesn't switch to 3 before a Wallrun (like it used to in TMNF).  TL;DR: The game is fast, simple, fun, unique. Really recommending it to people who like racing and competing with others in general.",

This is not a Game I would recommend playing unless you are ok with a Crappy Physics Engine and Pin Point Acurate Racing to the point where if you just hit the wall once... You have to restart. Which leads me to another Problem... There is no proper restart button... So you have to waste more time restarting the Damn Race then you spend in the race itself... All and all I'd give this game a 2/10 Rating",

I am being completely serious when I say this is probably the worst UI I have ever seen in a game, period. It is completely impossible to figure anything out. For some reason the main menu is a browser. For some reason browsing costs in-game currency. For some reason you can send mail, which also costs in-game currency. The server browser is a joke, the controls are an even bigger joke (♥♥♥♥ing arrow keys, are you kidding me?!)  Whoever was in charge of designing this piece of crap UI, please find a different line of work that doesn't involve designing anything ever again. Your handywork made me refund this game out of pure frustration within 30 minutes. Congratulations.",
