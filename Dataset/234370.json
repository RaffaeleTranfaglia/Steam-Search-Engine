    "description": "An Environmental Puzzle Game About Family, Grit, and Survival.Grays roam the land, largely in the absence of human interference. These aren't your typical Zed -- theirs is a very different sort of apocalypse. Animals spontaneously transform into twisted, violent beings. The earth decays, collapsing into a network of abysses.",

            "review_text": "Another fun game from Arcen. This is different from all their other titles (and I have no idea how they churn them out so quickly). It has a Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past feel to it, but with specific 'puzzles' to work through as you advance. The puzzles typically aren't so hard that you ragequit, and are presented in a way that you can bypass some of them if you want. The story is good and unfolds at a reasonable pace, and it's very atmospheric. This is another entry on my very short list of games that I prefer to play with a gamepad.",
