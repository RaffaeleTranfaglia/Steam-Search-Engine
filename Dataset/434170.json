The rest are mediocore at best, the game 'Guesspionage' being absolute trash. 'Fakin it' can really only be played with aquantainces. When I played it with my family, it was super easy to guess the faker, as we all knew eachother and out lives. For example I knew my sister has a whisk in her car, so when that came up in the last round, I knew she wasn't the faker.  Overall I recomend it. If you are only going to buy one party pack, I'd suggest Party Pack 2 over 3.",

            "review_text": "Couldn't wait on my friends to try out this new pack after playing the ♥♥♥♥ out of the other two.  Game told me at least 3 times I have no friends.  Feelsbadman.  EDIT: After playing for real, it's good.   Let me start off with Quiplash 2. If you've played the first one: it's basically that, BUT you can also make your own prompts. Which is pretty good. Quiplash is my favourite to play with drunken friends. It's just so much fun.  Secondly, Guesspionage. It was ok when playing with my friends. It's basically just a game of higher/lower, nothing else. However, it was such a blast watching a streamer play it. Because then, instead of the normal 'global data', it uses the answer that the stream watchers are giving, which was a lot of fun.  Faking it is decent. It probably can be fun, but I've found it to be waay to hard to fake, unless you're lucky with the questions. Another downside is that you can only play it in person.  Trivia Murder party is great, it kinda reminds me of You Don't Know Jack, from the first pack. It is witty, with good questions, and the minigames are hilarious. Be prepared to get absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed over though.  Finally Tee K.O. Meh. It took really long to play 'a game', and it was just the same thing over and over again. You have to be in a very creative group to make this fun, and you can't be playing to win. This game mode might work as a streamer, because you get the audience votes, but in a group of 5 it was the least liked game mode.  So why have I recommended this game? Quiplash just does it for me. It's the ultimate game to play with friends, and will have you crying with laughter. For a little bit more serious and competitive game, there's Trivia Murder Party. However, if you have to choose between Pack 2 and 3, I'd suggest 2. I just got this because 1 &amp; 2 were an absolute blast, and I want to support the developers.",

While there will always be ideas for improvement, I can't overstate how good these games are. Jackbox are so far ahead of the competition. I seriously can't even think of who the next best is...  I'll continue to buy Jackbox Party Pack games day one as long as they keep making them!",
