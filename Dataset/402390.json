Last night with my friends we played this game non stop, laughing a lot and hating each other on the space soccer fields and the last man standing arena :) In single player mode you basically train with an AI that is best then you and all of your friends out of the box, even in normal mode 0.0 (had fun but Maaaaaaan that needs a lot of focus!)
