            "review_text": "This a great little platform game that puts me in mind of the old 8 bit explorer games with huge maps such as Underwurlde, Nodes of Yesod, Starquake and the like. You have abilities that are unlocked as you progress and let you explore more of the map which is quite a task to progress through. The graphics are suitably retro and I found the music rather soothing. It's not very long though although there are a few hidden rooms to discover. My only gripes are achievements not unlocking for me and the game had a habit of freezing for a few seconds but these aside, this is a solid platform game that's worth a look.",
