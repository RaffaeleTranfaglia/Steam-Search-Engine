            "review_text": "I thought that this was one of the more compelling Nancy Drew games, dealing with Nancy as the main suspect, which gave the plot a bit more of a twist because it is unique among the many Nancy Drew games that I have played. The town layout and the stories behind the characters added to the game and I think that it was fast paced and interesting. I would recommend this game and I think it was one of the stronger games of the Nancy Drew series.",

It was a bit short though and I would have loved to see more puzzles in the game. All and all it was a great experience and one that I have finished 3 times and can't wait for the next time I feel the need to play as Nancy Drew and solve a mystery! 7/10",

            "review_text": "Least favorite ND game so far. I hate the fact that to change characters you have to call Nancy every damn time. It got to the point I had to mute my game because their voices started to make me grind my teeth. I got stuck halfway through and have no idea what to do now. Every time I call someone (as each person) or talk to a suspect (as each person), I just get the 'Hi'... 'Bye'. I've gotten all the items, the only thing I can think of is I went out of order or something, and if thats the case, thats ridiculous seeing as you can be 4 different damn people, there should be no way to go out of order. I've gone to every location as every playable character and... nothing... so **** it, I dont even care. The plot was boring anyway.",

It was a little easier than some of the other games and I beat it in 5 hours or so, but I think the storyline was good and the puzzles were okay. What I'd love to see is the older ND games being remastered for OSX.",
