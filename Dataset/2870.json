Questionable design choices such as flying to 'info points' to get discounts that make trading worthwhile, tedious travel system and ship humping mini-game (you will see if you choose to buy), 'station immersion' where you're forced to walk through hallway after hallway of ugly textures to get to a junk merchant who will then buy your space junk at extremely low prices.   Besides a complete overhaul and redesign, this game is unsalvageable even with patches. Avoid unless you are staging a public critique of game design choices and this will be your example for poor direction.",

            "review_text": "With the 2.50 Patch the game is now where it should have been when released, that is, really playable, hardly any ruining game bugs.   Now you can start from scratch, earn cash with your long range scanner, get some money for your first little traders (gigurum), make deals with stations, earn reputation through missions, make deals with trader agents to keep station trades updated to your computer and start building your empire. And if you want your fighting rush, on hard difficulty you need to wise up to survive battles against more than a 3 small ships and capital ships are a real challenge (not like before which you could capture with no effort).   Factory building is the most rewarding and polished thing in this game, building your complexes bit by bit, to make huge profits later on (if you do the proper ones in the proper locations obviously, Fusion Reactors anyone!? wink wink)   All the game needs right now is exploiting exploration to a greater extend, add hazardous areas, npc factions with more life, etc. but that is already coming in December it seems, anyways, with a bit more stretch in the end-game, that is, what makes sandbox games interesting (lots things to do aside from the main plot story).   So I can only recommend this game as it is NOW and congratulate for a good job to Egosoft from lifting this one up from the ashes. They made a good engine but the state of release was simply rushed and aweful. Luckily they have managed it well.   Just buy it if you are into space genre, trading, factory building, exploration (later on), huge cap ship fighting, etc..",

            "review_text": "150 Hour review,   okey so i've been playing X-rebirth (on steam) for 150 hours now so thought why not its probably time to write a review for the game so others can see what its like. the first thing to get out of the way is NO this is not X-rebirth 1.0 that sucked and was almost umplayable and missing a lot, i'm playing on X-rebirth 3.51 atm and they have truely turned the game around and its pretty much amazing now.  What i love about the game The thing about x-rebirth that i love is how massive the world is and the fact it is all rendered in real time with all of your owned ships, you can be just wandering around a station collecting stashes while one of your stations is receiving wares on the other side of the galaxy, or one of your patrolling ships encounters a xenon that wondered into the area. the world never stops and waits for you to finish a mission or to catch up to someone your following to continue like it does on so many other games and thats one of the things i love about it.  The other major thing i love is that you control all of whats happening from your one ship, the Albion skunk you can start as just a little ship doing all the work yourself to managing a giant fleet, or a trading empire or whatever you want and its so imersive in that sense because you don't just instantly get these things you have to find ways to get the money to buy a construction vessel to start building a station, be it slowly with missions moving cargo or transporting people, or by accepting missions from the pirate factions and getting several million by causing mass chaos (at the downside of turning factions against you) you can do whatever you want.  What i hate about the game Honestly the only thing that bugs me about the game is how they haven't been able to go as far as they could of with the whole idea of the economy, yeah each faction has its own funds and stations and resources and stuff but theres still instances where it feels like ships spawn in out of nowhere instead of being built, like with some of the pirate factions in the game, they have their own stations yes but they are in now way capable of building ships or making money to supply the pirates? and the pirates don't actually raid trade shipments, they attack it then if they win they just fly off and look for another one. i can't help but feel that they could have done more with that so that pirates actually had to attack people to survive and if you fought them off enough or launched attacks on their outposts it would slow them down or eventually destroy that faction. since you can make giant empires and have fleets of 50 ships easily but you cant seem to stop a group of pirates.   Community the only problem with the game changing so much is that when you search google for guides and stuff they are all for older versions of x-rebirth, or the wiki's are no longer up-to-date because the people who were working on them have long since given up on the game as have many fans because of how long it has taken them to get a nicely working version of it. it's also majorly effected the game's rating and put off a lot of new gamers coming to play it, but trust me this is not the same game it is a epic trading/empire/war simulation.  Mods with the prospect of mods now aswell you can completely destroy people's stations and help some factions build more of their own, the mods have added a tonn of content to the game along with what there already is in it so i do recomend checking them out.  Overall, if you like actually thinking about a game then get this xD its whatever you wanna do kinda game and worth the cash, if you wanna get nitty gritty into working out different productions and sabotaging other companies so your's will be able to sell stuff at higher price you can be that kinda player, but if you just like flying around shooting stuff there is that too, whatever kinda playstyle you have you can make your way in x-rebirth",

            "review_text": "It's honestly with a heavy heart that I do not recommend X: Rebirth.  First some backstory.  I first got into the X series with X3: Terran Conflict. It was intimidating and daunting, but I got it during a sale, and I figured that I should at least invest some time into it. While it was a rocky start at first, I managed to learn the ropes and have myself a good time with space combat and trading. Excited, I bought Albion Prelude, and got even more enjoyment due to the improvements upon the systems. The addition of the stock market, for example, was very much appreciated.  Soon after playing Albion Prelude, I heard about the development of X: Rebirth. Promising to be more accessible but just as deep, I became incredibly excited. Bohemia Interactive had promised something similar with ARMA3 and they delivered on their promise. I expected just the same from Egosoft- and why not? They had been working on the X series for more than 10 years- they knew what their fans wanted and expected.  At least... They should've known.  But X: Rebirth put my faith into Egosoft into doubt.  X: Rebirth is nothing short of a mess.  First off, the game is poorly optimized, with framerate drops quite abundant in the earlier areas and very apparent across the campaign. Some areas are not quite as bad, but it's very clear that there was minimal QA done. The computer I use is very powerful but even then it chugs with Rebirth.   Secondly, things are buggy. Ships under your command behave strangely, trading sometimes does not carry out, and orders can be backed up with no way to cancel them. Saying that it is a test of patience would give too much credit to the game- it is downright broken. Patches have fixed some of the problems, but many still hang around.  Thirdly, the elements Egosoft touted for immersion are of poor quality. From the number of character models to the interiors to the voice acting... The detail is not even up to 2008 standard, much less a game being released in 2013. This could be forgiven somewhat if it wasn't for the fact of how repetitious many of these elements were. There's probably only about five or so voice actors across the entire game, all with equally wooden delivery. Ren Otani's VA is the best, but that's best in the sense of 'Of all the moldy sandwiches in the fridge, this one has the least amount of mold.'  Minigames have been put in place, but they feel incredibly out of place in a game meant to be a space trading simulator. Tapping buttons to time 'convince' meters for small-talk or zipping behind ships to speed through the highways are elements intended for action-focused games, not simulators.  But perhaps most heartbreaking of all, the game is missing so many features that made the past X games great. The radar system is now gone, as well as readouts for speed and distance. Combat has been given more of a focus but it has lost its complexity and tactical thought. The elements that should help with establishing a gian trade empire are gone, such as trade automation.  This is not the X game that we were promised.  There ARE some things in X: Rebirth that are worthwhile. The detail put into the universe is nothing short of incredible. The low texture resolution can be forgiven as there is now a true sense of scale to the world- the highways, one of the most impressive elements in X: Rebirth, zip you from sector to sector, which can range from stations located in the center of a broken planet to derelict but surviving facilities only tens of thousands of miles away from a star. It's awe-inspiring, flying around in space.  The base of X: Rebirth is not terrible. It has given us a more moddable engine capable of a very detailed universe. But sadly, it should've been more. Knowing Egosoft, they will work tirelessly to patch and fix the game, but the damage has been done- I've lost a lot of my trust in them. After being so enthusiastic about a game, I honestly feel betrayed.  Perhaps in a few months, the game may become what I expected. When that time comes, I'll revisit this review.",

            "review_text": "After replaying this after the 3.0 patch, and with a fresher mindset, i feel I can give this game a fairer review.  In a word, X rebirth, is alright. I really wish steam reviews had a better system than a thumbs up or down, because I do not believe this game to be praiseworthy, but neither should it be within the mostly negative on the steam page.  It is not by any means a bad game, but it is not a great one either. I still feel if you are wanting to get into the X series, to start you should play X2: the threat or X3: Terran conflict (or Albion prelude, AP is essentially an expansion for TC anyway) however on its own, X Rebirth stands a good space 4X first person space simulator. It has some nice looking paint, a tutorial that is excellent for teaching new players to the X series (whereas before, the game plonked you into a grand universe, without even controls to do anything, with the exclusion of X3, where there is a flight school, that simply tells you how to move your ship. To start this mission, you must open communications with it, which the game neglets to give you the command to do so)   Many people were also afraid of the bugs when it first came out. Most of the serious bugs have now been squashed, and the game playable, there are still errors that can be easily seen, but thankfully none that impact the gameplay massivly (the worst ive seen is a group of NPC ships getting stuck together). Although I feel that Ego was going for a major shift in gameplay, alienating many fans of the X series. I do not think that this was made to be a Space management game. Trading takes too long, and profits made during runs are often not worth the time. However, I feel that Ego was going for a more, action RPG type game, and tried to blend the X formula into it.   For example, combat is a lot more profitable now, than in previous games. Repairs for your vessel could cost upwards to a few million credits in any previous X game. Here, it should cost less than 100 grand, no matter your hull. This isnt even accounting for the seemingly Hyperinflation that occured during the time of Rebirth, money is no longer measured in the hundreds of thousands, but in up to 4 digits. For example, say I had 5,264,194 credits in my account. Any previous game would show that as 5,264,194, here it is shown as 5.264M. It does not go into detail about exactly how much money you have, which would be necessary in a detailed management game.   The speed of combat, and the changes in the combat system have also been changed to be a lot more faced paced. Another change to make it into a more robust Action game. There have only been a few instances in which the player was actually given a character, however those were really only referenced in the main plot missions, and then it was simply by name most of the time. Here Ren Otani (thats you) is not only given a name, but a voice and a very slight personality. He can walk around on ships, engage in talks with other people, and the player now actually thinks about who it is driving their ship, rather than the mystical being who manifestes as a space suit.   I shall be continuing this review as i get further into the game, but for now, a TLDR section.  X Rebirth, is not worth $40, it is an okay Space sim, with some light space managerial options and a heavy emphases on combat. It is a good game for new players into the X series to try out to get used to the ideas of how a X game operates, before moving onto a previous title if they are intrested in the management and stratergy of those games. But for now, pick up the game on sale (for $15-20 bucks or less), itll be worth your time if you havent tried out the X series and wanted to learn about it, although this game is not an accurate representation of how a X game operates. Although, space exploration is an absolute pain in this game, and areas quickly become generic.",

            "review_text": "I own all of the X games. Rebirth was the most 'attractive one' for me. New interface (let's face it, the old one was terrible -&gt; keeping it complex doesn't mean that it should also be inaccessible), station interiors, a story line that will suck us in and so.  Well, first of all, the cockpit design was good, at least as an idea. Being able to wander around in your ship is also good. As an idea.  What Rebirth did wrong is that, all the ideas that would elevate the gameplay were implemented so bad that, they actually hurt the title.  The interface causes more issues than fun. Yeah, every space sim fan loves to wander around in their ship, experiencing the roleplay of a space farer. However, when that cockpit causes you to loose your tradeships, fail your missions, limit you from using other angles to see your ship, etc. it becomes a burden. Come on, Privateer had multiple angles and camera views AND a cockpit view. A game that came out two decades ago!  The story, it could've been interesting, even if being a total cliché. However, the voice acting KILLS the atmosphere. God, the voice acting is SO bad that, you will IMMEDIATELY want to turn the audio speech off. The dialogue scripts are also terrible. It is as if a kid wrote the whole script. You meet with the remnants of a long time enemy, in two sentences, you decide to help them fix their base. They are not surprised to see you, you are not surprised to see them etc.  The interiors are all the same, with little to zero difference. The station dialogue stuff is basically trading menus while staring at an NPC, a very badly modeled one to be exact. The 'dialogue like' menu is also completely useless. It looks like a pre-alpha stage Mass Effect dialogue tree used for a menu system.  The co-pilot you get in game as a part of the story is also completely useless. Whenever you are occupied with something else, she just... well, she just 'exists' that is all. No autopilot, no anything.  The dialogues with other NPCs are also terrible.  The only thing I liked about the game was the graphics. They weren't on today's high end standards and the game crashes or stalls more than a player can bear, but they were still good.  However, gameplay elements of the game were poor at best in every sense and in every department that, it would be disrespectful to recommend this game as a part of a genre where you can find titles like Privateer, Freelancer (in all its flaws), IWar, DarkStar One (even that one is better) and worse, other X games. Heck, even playing back the very old classics like Elite would be much more fun, while you await for the upcoming Star Citizen and Elite 4 as a fan of the genre.  I was really hopeful about this game, even pre-ordering it.  Such a shame... So much potential down the drain.",

Many people I have spoken with believe the game has gone from a 1/10 to a 7/10 and counting. The great thing about egosoft is they don't release a game and then forget about it. They constantly add to it and update it over time.   I feel like X-R at release was simply the release of a foundation/framework that was meant to be built upon over time, both by the devs and the modding community. This turned many people off because they expected a completed game with every single bell and whistle they desired. Those bells and whistles were not in at release, but they are here now. Either by the devs or the great modding community.  The devs have fixed almost every bug I've ever heard of/encountered. They have added very nice UI improvements and quality of life features.The mod authors have filled in the gaps with afew nice things, but I wouldn't be surprised if the devs added them to vanilla.

As you could probably have guessed I pre-ordered X rebirth and as a result was one of the many that were shocked at how Egosoft could even dream that the game was a finished product. I persevered but after about 10 hours of pain I resumed Albion prelude and tried to pretend Rebirth never happened.  That was 2 years ago...  I recently returned to X rebirth to see what 2 years of bug fixing looked like. Credit were its due as the game is much improved. Yes there are still bugs and no it's not the same as the games that preceded it but I have to say it works. The immersive feeling of adventuring, exploring and conquering a vast and beautiful universe is there. The size and complexity of the ai stations is incredible and the changes made to the way sectors work is enjoyable (I kind of like the way the transport system works).  Now I've yet to progress that far (and from what I know of the X series in guessing I have a lot left to discover) but the foundations of the gameplay are there for me and not simply a repetition of the previous games.

I also enjoy the DLCs quite alot (only one is shown in the shop so far, but another one is coming, which is even more worth purchasing).  To be frank, the campaign story is kind of meh, especially the last mission, but the story was (except for the very first X-title X-Beyond the frontier) never a focus point of the games.  As a fan since the beginning of the series, i hated the new highway system in the beginning because i thought making the warp gates more rare and instead focussing on highways was a betrayal to the series, especially since i did not care about the Albion sectors in the X3-series. But after a while i must say that i love the new highway system, its a great way to enjoy the scenery and to take a short break while flying from sector to sector.  It also has great mod support, a really nice mod community and a really great community overall. And i must emphasize, unlike many developers who have a bad/broken launch and just abandon the game, Egosoft is known for supporting and improving the game even years after it's initizal release, and while almost every title in the X-series was incredibly broken at launch (hence the many bad reviews) Egosoft always did their best to improve the game to make their games great, even if it takes many years of (usually) free updates and patches.  The only huge gripe i have with this game is it's over-complicated and over-complex menu/sub-menu system to do simple things. But after a while you get used to it.  Unpatched on release it was garbage, over time it became acceptable, now i think it's a nice addition to the X-series and i'm always eagerly waiting for Egosoft to put in new updates. Is it perfect? By all means no.  Is it enjoyable? In my opinion yes (why else would i play it over 500 hours?), as long as you don't have problems with fiddling around with menus.",

I have played it for as long as I can take, I have tried to play through all the bugs and poor performance top see if there is a deeper game hidden away waiting to be discovered, and found its just not there.",

Being able to command big capital ships was something that was a very memorable experience. Trying to get into big fleet battles was interesting. You had the whole universe of hundreds of systems to play in and play with which is the best part of any X Series game.   X Rebirth was something of a disaster, especially at launch. Many of the bugs were fixed with upcoming updates for X Rebirth but the gameplay and the Freedom that was once there is no more. You no longer have the freedom to fly other small ships or “Captain” Capital Ships in any way or form. You can “Own” many ships but cannot “Fly” any ship. You are locked to a ship named “Albion Skunk”, ♥♥♥♥ poor name in my opinion, and are limited in not only a dozen weapons.  There are only, currently I believe 4 or 5 systems vs the Hundreds of systems previously accessible in the other X Series games. Would rather have hundreds of systems to explore rather than 4 or 5 with smaller sub areas you can visit.   X Rebirth, has certainly improved somewhat in combat and most certainly graphically from its predecessors. There are many new gameplay mechanics, such as the Space Highway System, Bigger Space Stations with multiple dock locations and areas to explore. However, many interiors are identical to one another, faces on all characters are all nearly the same and various other small things just almost don’t make it worth your time to dock and talk to people.   There have been many improvements since Launch, and some great content has been added. But the freedom to do what you want, that made the other X Games so successful, is no longer there.  To summarize this all up without going into a 5 page essay as to why this game is a disaster, I would NOT recommend buying the game unless you got money to blow.",

Quite frankly because it stinks, this game has tons of potential but so far isn't living up to it, if you are a fan of the X3 games for the sandbox style of play, give this game a wide berth for now until the modding community finishes what Egosoft started. As it stands, you can only pilot the Skunk which might be tolerable if it was a capital ship but no, it's a simple fighter. Also the menu systems bring you to a dead stop so issuing commands in battle may do more damage then it's worth. Drones can be controlled by the player, but what point is there in using drones when your ship sits still for the enemies? I mean, you have a co-pilot that won't actually co-pilot, all she will do is pretty much sit there as a conversation piece. To be honest, i miss my auto-pillock from X3, granted it would crash me into stations now and then, but atleast it MOVED MY SHIP instead of having me sit there doing NOTHING.  Update: Auto-Pillock is back! and the first thing it did was slam me into the station i was undocking from... Artificial difficulty make this less of an actual space sim and more of an FPS. problems from my original review are still present. will do another update at 3.0 or when patching is dropped due to being unable to plug the dam with a finger.

            "review_text": "X-Rebirth drew in a lot of hype from the X fans from what I remember seeing. It was due to renew a truly epic (albeit somewhat hardcore) series. I feel that failed.  To explain how I think Rebirth failed, I feel that it was the choice of components they overhauled that was the bad decision.  Giving us a 1-command-ship system. This was a big mistake in my opinion. Although upgradeable, it ends up limiting fighting capabilities without relying on AI support, effectively making the player more like a little commander who sometimes needs to hide behind his other, AI-controlled, ships.  Station Trading was another critical failure in my opinion. We've always had AI merchants at stations. But they weren't our main option, and they were easy to access. We just opened a menu. It was actually easier in the past. Having to haul around a station's recycled interior to find traders and get info is really annoying at times, and keeping the old comms-menu from X3 but with the new characters would have been great in my opinion. Having points on a station we need to explore to access was a little odd too. It wasn't a critical flaw, but surely it would be easier to detect any mission-givers around a whole station upon detecting the station? Assuming they are legal missions, of course. Seems odd to have them practically hide their missions.  If the developers had stuck with a more centralized station-interaction, I think half the issues with stations would be avoided.  Back to the player's ship. The Co-Pilot. I wouldn't believe the developers if they told me the voice-actress read the script before-hand, given the voice-acting quality. Also there's a serious limit to what she says, which just makes it worse. I've heard 'Now shut up Betty!' a few too many times for one game series. I can understand forcing her to be present in the campaign, but in freeplay it would be better if she wasn't there at all.   Now, NPC-interaction. This is kind of the same issue as the stations, as they are just tough to track down and we have to intentionally go seeking through more menus than before to find them. Surely if they are publicly revealing their presence, then wouldn't it be easier to download station information across all access points on the station? I had quite the hard time trying to find the right NPC for anything I wanted. Especially construction. Although in hindsight I was told that getting NPC's for stations was just due to them being in select areas. Again, the issue that they aren't obvious without my manual searching.  My final big criticism is the new menu system itself. It's great that Egosoft wanted easier-access. But what we ended up with is a really odd side-menu that just didn't agree with any decent resolutions. I run 1920x1080, which I feel isn't exactly out of the norm these days, but damnit the menus feel so chunky and so...console-ish, courtesy of the bloated interface. I assume Egosoft made it this way to save on visual differences and for immersion, but it really didn't pay off in my opinion. The new system seems to have focused too much on being nice to the new controller support (Although Albion-Prelude had it too, at least it was designed for keyboard and mouse). Re-arrangement would have helped newcomers to the series, but the old menu system, to me anyway, felt far more effective, far less chunky, and left players with greater control.  Overall, I'm giving X-Rebirth 5/10. They did well overhauling transit, graphics, AI-pathfinding, and ship-control, but failed on so many other fronts. I'm probably adding 1 extra point out of 10 on just for the nice main menu. (Again, in my opinion.). Only modding can save it now.",

Even with all the patches and updates that this game has received, it has hardly improved at all. It is horribly optimized and very buggy, with many features poorly explained, explained incorrectly, or just not explained at all.  The storyline is rushed and muddled, forcing the player through mind-numblingly boring missions, for factions that you don't care about, with several jumps and gaps that made me feel like I was missing information. Even X3 had a better plot, and trust me, that's really saying something.  Your companion is incredibly annoying, and frequently yells at your ship AI system for no reason, which is even  more  annoying than the ship AI itself.  Speaking of your ship, it's a piece of garbage, and can for some strange reason only use one gun at any time, a monumental change to combat compared to all other X series games. You can upgrade some parts of your ship to make it slightly less garbage, but in general you'll wish you could take some other ships for a fly-out. But no, you're stuck in the Albion Skunk. To make a bad situation worse, if you want to capture a ship that someone else has bailed from, to add it to your squad, you need to  have a spare pilot already on your ship.  Apparently all these ships lost all that autonomous AI tech that was around 60 (in-universe) years ago.  I can see where Egosoft was trying to go with this game, and I was willing to give them time to work on and improve this game, but now, after 2 expansions, 4 major versions, and 3 years, the game still has horrible UI, optimization, characters, cutscenes, dialogue, and interaction. Trading is a convoluted mess, combat is boring, exploration feels tedious, and in general,  this is not a fun game to play.   So, I urge you, go look for something else. There are some fantastic space sims out on the market now, or about to be released. If you don't have the budget for something triple-A, X3: Albion Prelude and X3: Terran Conflict are both far superior to this game, and often go on sale for under $10.",

I doubt that DeepSilver was out of money. I think DeepSilver was simply indifferent, maybe it was their way of saying 'promises must be kept'. But hell no. The one who says it, does not understands software industry and should not be in it as per se. You always, always plan for delays and set offs in such huge projects.

Luckly I purchased this game at a much later date when it was being sold for 50% off. As much as I want to recommend a game that developers put a ton of time into, I just cannot do it with X rebirth. Here are the reasons why:  1.) We'll start with the campaign; One thing I like about Syfi games is immersion. If you can make me feel like I'm in living breathing world with things to do at ever corner, you've done a good job. Now I must admit they almost had me but when I found out that NPC's in the game where not actually doing anything they're simply there for cosmetic purposes, that killed me.  2.) Voice acting, simply put, if I wanted to go see or hear talentless actors, I'd watch Twilight. The voice acting is absolutly, (ABSOLUTLY) atrocious. Coupled with bad resolution NPC models which a player would easily see that they all look simlar to one another, like a universe with a obvious incest problem.   What I don't understand if you would go to the lengths to make the outer world beautiful, and unique. Why not apply that same work when you're inside the station walking around? Keep in mind AAA graphics is not the bread-and-butter of a game, but keeping graphics the consistant through out definitely helps.  3.) I've played the earlier installments of the 'X series' and enjoyed them very much, personally one of the things I enjoyed the most was being able to switch ships around for bigger and badder ones. Although piloting a ship is one-hundered times better in X Rebirth, you are limited to one ship. Many people will aurgue this, but point blank if you're going to compete with today's space sims this is a feature your game is going to need.  The good:    1.) With all that said, the game does have it's good side. One, being piloting the ship and navagating through menus is awesome, takes some time to learn.    2.) The 'outer world' (when you're flying in space, near station (ect...). Is beautiful! And very futuristic looking.   3.) The game does offer things to do being: Minging, Gas harvesting, Station building, Trading, and exploring.   4.) I'll give it to Egosoft, they know they fu(ked up. But are working to impove the games mechanics, and any game braking issues. Hopefully the game will have a birghter furture, we'll see.  For sure this game is not worth the $49.99 it is currently being sold for, but it is worth the $25 or so bucks that I bought it for during the sale.",

This edit is as of 3.2. There are still many game breaking bugs; Ships caught in trade loops, random crashes, off and on framerate drops. While things slowly are getting better, I still do not recommend the game in its current state. Bugs aside, gameplay is long and laborious... running back and forth through boring as heck trade lanes. They did take the lane minigame out, but even at that, the lanes are full of other small ships that get bombard you and slow you down. While I do like some of the first-person elements added to it such as ship crews etc... they are poorly implemented such as still limiting you to the Skunk ship, and having only a few NPC models.

I was alarmed when I read that there would be only one pilotable ship, but was assured that it would be wildly customizable. They lied, there is virtually zero customization... which primarily revolves around which of a half-dozen weapons to equip.  They touted on-foot exploration as a groundbreaking feature where we could explore space stations and factories that actually had working machines producing physical goods using physical resources. They lied... there are ~4 layouts of space stations with a minimal amount of space to 'adventure'. Hallways are blocked off via doors painted on walls and piles of janitorial refuse. None of them appear to actually serve any real function, although one was obviously intended to be a jail. I guess some genius figured that nobody would question why 1/4 of the space stations in the game used to be prisons.  They got rid of the time acceleration feature, claiming that their usage of space highways would make the game faster. Unfortunately it just means that your cargo ships now take hours of real time to get anywhere since they don't use the highways. And you end up staring at the ♥♥♥ end of the 34th century's equivalent of a Honda Civic while traversing the wonders of space.  This may be the most disappointed I have ever been by a game.",

            "review_text": "Lets get 1 thing out of the way before i begin, i know a lot of people are disappointed that you cant personally use more than 1 ship. yes it stinks but this game was never designed to be that kinda game, so rating it as such is abit unfair, if you didn't keep up with the press pre-development and didn't know this, then that's your own fault.  So lets get started with my short review.  Egosoft has a Long History of Releasing games that simply don't work on launch, they have MASSIVE potential but they don't work on launch... THAT SAID, they also have a long history of sticking with their products post launch to fix all of the launch bugs, add content, and add community feedback to the game in order to make it amazing.  You will never see me fanboy for or back up any other developers, because they simply haven't earned it. Other devs always disappoint and never do for their games, what will Egosoft does for it's games. Egosoft is one of the rare devs that shouldn't get rated for their games on launch, to be fair YES it deserved the bad score then, but all of the newer players don't know what us older fans do, and that's that ego doesn't abandon its products. if we wait patiently, a year or 2 later we will have an amazing game to play. Don't believe me? Just look at the new reviews, they are positive!  I highly recommend anyone who gave this game a negative review in the past, reinstall this game and take a 2nd look around at all the new stuff that has been added. Their are also a number of really good mods to try. Personally i have a lot of mods and have a very customized immersive and enjoyable experience each time i login.    TLDR?  Next time you buy a Egosoft game do so in good faith. Install it, don't play it, wait a year for them to patch the problems its guaranteed to have on launch, then come back and play. It will be everything you hoped for and more! They are a very small studio and it takes time to make a good game. Also after you have beat the game, dont be afraid to come back from time to time and try it again. Egosoft has a wonderful habit of adding new things to their games after post launch, and all through out its life for years after.",

I have played many games in my life, and I would compare the enjoyability factor of this game to running through a federal prison naked while slathered in baby oil. In fact, I would take federal prison over playing this game because even though you know you are going to get ♥♥♥♥ed, at least it will be over in 10 to 20 years.  I have played through games called Temple of Elemental Evil, Pools of Radiance, and Battle Toads, and I can safely say that those three games brought more joy and memories to my life than X-rebirth. I have seen movies called Xanadu, Glitter, and The Human Centipede, and I feel that those movies held more art form and character than all of X-Rebirth. The images of ♥♥♥♥♥♥, tubgirl, and 2 girls 1 cup still haunt my dreams, and yet I would rather look at those than the character models of X-Rebirth.  Egosoft should stop trying to fix this game... stop it... stop it right now. Their best option is to apologize and pretend that this game never came out. If I could time travel I would go back to my past self and punch me in the balls. I would also bring with me all of the reviews of this game to warn the others of their future poor decisions.

Looks like I've about a hundred hours in, and I've barely begin to scratch the surface - but I've been having a heckuva lot of fun playing. This is a deep, rich, immersive game. I start it up and the hours happily fly by.  I'm gonna keep this short because given the choice I'd prefer to be actually playing the game. I've only ever bothered to write one Steam review before, but I wanted to toss in my two cents on this game. I don't know if you'll like it (evidently a good proportion of folks are still determined not to like it) - but I do know this game has given me what I've been searching for a long time.  I've been trying a bunch of space / sci-fi games - many of them great games - but to greater or lesser degrees I always felt something missing. I finally figured out what it was. It was what I loved most about good sci-fi: the sense of Wonder. Well I've found it here in this game.  This is a richly imagined space game, with a bit of a high fantasy edge - places feel different and alive and beautiful. I've apparently spent a hundred hours just flying around, exploring, admiring. I've done some missions, I've done some fighting, I've made some credits, I've made some friends and some enemies - but mostly I've just been smiling a whole lot.  I've only seen the tip of the iceberg. I haven't yet assembled a fleet, or even bought my first Capital ship; I haven't yet built an empire, any stations, or even my first trader; I haven't yet captured my first ship, or even fully pimped out my own. I have yet to dip into the Teladi DLC, and have already pre-purchased the upcoming HoL DLC. I see many many many more happy hours ahead. I think I've finally found my Space Skyrim.  It must be disheartening for the Devs to see so much obstinate negativity; they had a vision and they've been working hard to keep polishing it (I'm on the 4.0 beta). For my own part a big thank you to them, and their next X game will be an instant buy for me.  Anyhoo. If the first hundred or so hours are anything to go by, this game is right among my few all time faves - don't know if you'd like it, but then I don't know if you like ice cream either.

The map system is terrible and I found it very difficult to actually use it to get anywhere with especially since the X3 maps were good.  My other disappointment is the lack of an external camera and no way to look from side to side, had I known this up front I most likely would not have bought this game at all.  On the up side there have been quite a few patches that have solved some of the many issues with promise of more to come.

The engine is *slow*, framerates are really low. But the worst is that it's not fun at all and I did try it! The game mechanic is so simplified that there is not much to do. The freighters have little command options and the ones they have only work half of the time.  As much as it pains me to say but stay away from this game, it's not worth it, not even for 5€ on sale.

They force you to go through stations in order to get crew for your ship, and upgrade. The stations are mostly cut and paste between less than 5 models, and are meant for you to go blindly through and rob it blind. Character models look like something from the 90's, and there is no variation in communication.  In space, nobody can hear you scream as your trade ships lock up. Your combat ships might as well be ornaments since you can't tell them to attack, and unless it's a capital ship, it's dead before it can attack back. As of writing this, you can't buy small ships to outfit your fleet or small trade ships to embark on cheap trading.  If you get far enough from station, you can no longer access trades that were previously there. Stations are not able to be freely placed, and if you don't pay careful attention, they don't function.  The save files are uncompressed XML files, meaning if you have access to notepad, you can cheat your way to achievments by editing them to your hearts content. The install is laden with files that are meant to be used on XBox. Regular controls for computer such as the keyboard/mouse/joystick don't function as well as a computer game should run.

            "review_text": "X rebirth is what you get when you take past X games, arguably take the best parts of those games and add a full body avatar to them. The game starts off good but you will find that there are a ton of bugs present in the initial launch game.   The game is a pretty good space sim, and extremely detailed. Lots of ships are flying about, space cities and stations that span several kilometers and have intricate workings. Lots to see and lots to do. the same can be said for fights with capital ships, no longer are these behemoths large bludgions that will kill your ship when they as much as take a right turn if you happen to be in their way. And instead of just attacking them to dwindle down their HP, they now have actual hard-points on board that can be destroyed, often after you get past the shield generator that protects them. Destroy the engines, jump drive and docking bay ports can render a ship incapable of defending itsself. But get too close or in line of sight with its AA batteries and there will be hell to pay. Large scale battles between multiple capital ships can be a sight to behold. Small ships on the other hand will swoop around larger objects and seek you out, through they can be easy to kill with the right weaponry.  It is certain to say that the combat mechanics of X-rebirth are certainly an improvement. Unfortunately this can not be said about some of its other main mechanics, and this is mostly due to bugs... Lots and lots of bugs...  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ - Minor bugs that take you out of the game:  Like crouching characters and falling through the floor when spawning.  - Annoying bugs &amp; behaviour such as:  Icons and triggers not loading for at least half a minute after undocking, or the fact that you often need perfect line of sight to see missions. Or being unable to buy items at discount because you can't afford the the item at full price.  - Major game breaking bugs such as:  Ships that were impounded not being returned to you after a mission is complete, deleting them from the game. Trade ships not functioning like they should, getting stuck.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Another problem is both the games strength and weakness, SATA, (the time skipping feature used to speed up the game) has been removed. Instead, you will now find highways, high speed routes that cross entire sectors. These highways function great for getting around, (as long as there is traffic on them, otherwise you're still very slow). When off the highways you now have a boost feature (partially to replace SATA) this boost allows you to rapidly accelerate, but in exchange it drains your shields. Its a great feature, but shouldn't be used too much in combat.  Initially and AFAIK there is no fast travel to speak of. I suspect you'll be able to hitch a ride later on a capital ship with a jump drive, but I can't say for sure if this is player controled, or just a part of specific missions.   Unfortunatly, capital ships seem to lack the boost feature. Meaning that you will often have to wait several minutes for your trade ship to complete its docking procedure after it jumps into the area, something SATA in previous games so nicely circumvented.  This is compounded by the sheer size of the game world. Finding a character that sells you something can be a chore or even worse, and this is all because even though the game world is suppose to be defined, the merchants and NPC's, besides the terminals you buy and sell bulk goods from are all randomly generated.   So if a character gives you a recommendation for a certain mechanic (npc) with very good stats, that npc won't be there the next time you dock.  Characters, like any other installment of the X series, look like they are either 70 years old, or had a serious cosmetic accident. And the voice acting, while not terrible, has some of the worst writing I've ever heard. Don't even get me started on the small talk feature.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In conclusion, I guess the campaign is decent, if somewhat stale.  Most of the tasks you are asked to do are default sandbox cookie cutter missions such as, Find NPC, Buy/Sell, Deliver, Kill, Scan, Mine, etc. Unfortunately, the few that I found that are unique and contain story telling tend to be quite buggy. The first 5 hours are spend teaching you the ropes on how to play the game. This makes the campaign just a tutorial for the sandbox mode.   My advice to people who are considering this game, WAIT. The game is fun to play, if it works... but right now there are too many things broken. Luckily, if EGOSOFT has one saving grace, its that they are pretty good at patching their games. At this time they have already released 20 patches. Give it half a year to a year, pick it up during a steam sale and have the experience this game was suppose to have at launch...",

Yes there were issues and hurdles that had to be over come here and there in previos versions and some that never got resolved; I had hoped that this would be the truth here too as a new direction in this groud breaking thought line. I have been playing the last 4 itterations of the Xuniverse franchise (I got hooked with the original X2 big time). I was hoping that maybe all the hype was just due to this being a complete revamp of the entire design, alas this is not completely right, yes it is a revamp but with the redesign I find it more fun to play any space game but this one including DarkStar One, which advertised the same but was a bit of a fun yet still a flop of a game. I would argue that nearly 90% of the intelligence and aspects of what made the previous game difficult to develop and create were removed or cheated out (Ships would commonly fly THROUGH stations so they do not have to die by the station simply becasue they can not fly around it). If you wish a list of items that no longer exist then please ping me any time I will give you far greater detail as the game is no longer 'A Living Economy' but now a totally fake and DEAD one, and I primise not to just wine because they changed the paint job, this game really does make me very sad that I spent the money to buy it. I would have been better off spending that money on ANY other game including variants I do not like playing on PC, I hate to support horribly done games and I have to say I really am dissapointed in the developer I tryly enjoy games from (EGSOFT) thinking this was a releasable game (not to mention the number of serious buggs in it), after within only a few minutes of my first maiden flight I got runover by a freighter and pushed 'through' the walls of a station and locked inside it making it impossible to escape and having to completely restart the game.   I highly reccoment as a gamer that you stay away from this title, get all of the X3 previous titles if you want to really enjoy a game for a long time and have endless relayability (I normally do not replay game but I have done so MANY times with X3 itterations previous to Rebirth).   I am truly sorry EGSOFT, you really let everyone down on this title, pleaes go back and look at why the previous game was so enjoyed and rethink the architecture including the rendering engine.

There are many differences good and bad and some concepts are implemented a bit more simpler and some are far more complex.  You take the role of a single ship captain and view the universe from one perspective.  I think the latest version is extremely enjoyable, 3.53, far more so with use of Mods. If you loved the role of playing statistical manager from the safety of a itemized data screen then this game is not for you. The ability to directly control mass ships via a remote display map screen in X3 is not as easily, or not at all the same in Rebirth. Think of it as traveling through the universe in a single ship with emphasis on what is in front of you.  As a FPSS (first person shooter ship) this game is a whole hell of a lot of fun. It is easy to organize fighter squads under your wing and with a click order them to attack a target. This aspect of the game is wonderful.  Drones, missiles, and underlings are your path to survival.  Again look at it from a single point character as you fly the Albion Pride influencing the universe as you go. You can personalize the cockpit, or mod your own!, to make your ship more to your own liking.  For Trading I think it is far more satisfying than previous games. No, you can't personally captain the largest freighter in the universe. What you can do is have freighters in your squad and as you fly through the universe quickly assign them trade jobs. This is even made easier with trade software and you can do this all from a menu screen. Give a single freighter 4 or 5 trade jobs and go do something else, or dock on that trade ship and watch the action from the bridge.   You are not the captain, you are the Admiral, and Admirals don't drive, they command.   The campaign I find enjoyable. Much more simplistic than many missions in X3 but it serves as an excellent Tutorial which was greatly missed in prior X games. If you find yourself starting to see the short failings of certain aspects of the game CONGRATULATIONS you've made it further in this game than most do in the previous X3 games :P  With that said, no, Rebirth does not have the same Universe longevity as say X3 TC. You will hit that end game moment a bit sooner and find less to do, at least at the moment. Then again the X series has always been about what you make of it, so try something new, or mod.  In ending, yes I can now recommend X Rebirth as the game is excellent and becoming better and better each official release with amazing mods to make the universe remarkable. Has it overcome X3 TC/AP ? not quite, but it's damn close.",

Issues with this game range from low performance, buggy animations, buggy AI, terrible voice acting (I cannot stress this enough, it is by far the worst voice acting I have heard in recent years), game breaking bugs that make finishing the campaign impossible, crashes and corrupt saved games.  The latest patch even introduced a new bug that completely disrupts trading in the game (and thus almost all production as well). Hopefully this issue will be patched soon enough. If you are considering purchasing this game anytime soon, I'd recommend disabling automatic updates and only allowing the game to patch after you've checked the forums for any major new issues.

            "review_text": "So, I'm a fan of space sims. I love X3, X3 Terran Conflict and X3 Albion Prelude. The sheer scale of the open world in the old games was incredible, play as a mercenary, military officer, pirate, trader or entrepenuer. The choice was yours. So, when I heard that X Rebirth was in the works, I was over the moon. I was right up there excited about what was promised to be the most immersive X game yet. The reality is quite different. If you want the short version, skip to summary.  I'll start with the positives:   The game is, astetically beautiful. Ripe with amazing models, seemless transitions between sectors and the freelancer highway system, the effects, reflections and graphical detail are incredible. Adding further to the immersion is the ability to walk around your ship and talk to crew.  It also had a tutorial that put a nice ease on the learning curve.   Now the negatives:   Now I mentioned walking around your ship. Yes, this is cool. Unfortunately, the only ship the player can control is the Pride of Albion. While the ship is able to recieve upgrades, the real beauty of the X3 games (for me) was the ability to fly nearly any ship. You could fly a fighter, a bomber, a cargoship, a transport, a megafreighter, even battleships and fighter carriers. As far as I'm aware, you can't even use mods to change your player ship (or if you can, nobody has bothered to create one). The hidden beauty of the X3 games was their moddability. Ship models are availiable for download (for free) on egosoft's forums for the older games. For me, I view this as a real missed oportunity. They were able to extend the projectile distances in the new engine by quite a ways. This meant that capital class vessels really could initiate gun based artillery duels. The tragic truth is that without the ability to change ships, you can witness these battles, but you can't directly control them.  Summary: At the end of the day, I feel that Egosoft missed the mark. Instead of polishing gameplay and their gem, customization, Egosoft took the root that so many gamers are frustrated with: shiny coat of paint on a mediocre game. As Minecraft and Sword of the Stars II have shown, the game itself is what makes a game successful. Gameplay is more important than the shiny ships and pretty explosions. You can have a great game with 8 bit graphics and it will still sell. But you can't have a dodgy game in 1080p and expect many good reviews.  Addendum: I am looking at this game as a fan of previous X games. I think as far as sapce shooters go, it's alright, but it is a bit of a departure from the previous games.",

Following the campaign The mining company is now hostile with me and open fire everytime they are near my ship. Neutral space stations everywhere will do absolutely nothing when these ships fire on mine but if I return fire the immidiately respond against me. So what is the character the only person subject to the law in the entire universe?  In addition to that I'm on a mission where I apparently have to use a Trojan ROV except I don't have one and i've been to 4 different drone dealers none of which sell them. I've looked at the mission screen multiple times and it gives me no information at all. So now I'm going to youtube to look for answers as to what the **** I'm supposed to do on this mission to advance the plot. Furthermore I was in another area where I had to boost past some enemy ships to get through a gate, but the characters were talking. I boosted through before they were finished and the game made me go back through the gate only to come back again before it would update the navigation point lmfao.  One last thing. When you start the story mode you get a cargo ship with weapons and shields that the story has you purchase crew members for and even place in your squad so it follows you around. There is even a mission where you have to use your cargo vessel to ship something for you. The point I'm at now that ship has just vanished! I know exactly where it was and how much health it had. I also had a captain, an engineer, and a security officer on it all of which cost money. It was never in a battle it has just vanished. It's not in my property owned screen anymore it's just gone for no reason. If you want a big headache then this is the game for you.

I'm able to run games such as Skyrum, Bioshock, Warthunder, all on extream graphics settings with no problems, and adiquit frame rates. But X Rebirth is very choppy at the lowest settings. Not sure what kind of graphics engine they are using, but it's horible! And the bugs are to numerous to count, hell there is a bug that just teleports you out into the middle of no where?!  Now, with that being said, I will give the programmers credit, they have been comming out with patches on a regular bassis (almost weekly) in an attempt to do damage control, they have made some minor improvements to FPS problems, so there is hope for X Rebirth yet. So I would recommend that you not purchase this title at this time, give it about a year, wait for it to be on a Steam daily deal, get it at a reduced price, by then hopefully they will have most if not all of the bugs fixed.

First of all your immediate surroundings look cramped, and I'm not talking about the ship interior... It used to be a lot more spaced out and felt more of...well...space... The upscaling of the stations certainly did not do the game any good as well, as it only contributes to that same feeling. It really feels as though your in the middle of a concert than in space.  Second, the controls...I don't know what came over the developers when figuring this out, but after all the hard work they put in the X3 engine I really expected more. I found it near impossible to target a station to dock with, not to mention it being counter-intuitive; While you could click on a ship in the distance to target, get info, whatever, on stations that simply doesn't work. The menu system was a lot sleaker and less cumbersome as well, it reacted a lot faster without all the fancy animations / transitions and the general feel complemented the game as a whole. And although I like the idea of a board computer that gives that feeling of your character actually interacting with a computer, unless you run at a very high resolution it is very difficult to actually read what it's displaying (played on 1280x800).  Last but not least, the lanes...why...why not have sectors overlap eachother so you don't need all that fancy stuff, or load based on the ships radar distance...there are so many alternatives to using jump gates (if that was the goal) that are not so much of a nuisance.  I have played every X game, and have loved every single one of them, regardless of the terrible characters and all that; That somehow became part of the charm. But I seriously believe this to be a big mistake made by EgoSoft. If they wanted to make an engine / game that looked and felt so immensely different from the rest of the X series, they should really have experimented with some arbitrary new title that has nothing to do with it; A once off game that may have the potential to grow into an entirely new series, or merge with the X series at a later time, whatever.

I've bought several early access (alpha) games on Steam in the past, and they were all in a better shape than X Rebirth is. The current state of things means you have to be a masochist to play the game, it's just frustrating and full of bugs.  With another year of development, it might have been a decent enough game to stand on its own, but even if all the bugs were to be fixed, it will never really be able to live up to the expectations people who have played the previous X games have. It will never be able to compete with them as a sandbox game due to design decisions (really, one flyable ship?), it will never be able to compete as a trade/economy game since that entire part of the game is underdeveloped and completely devoid of any automation. Due to the horrid UI (to be honest, the X games have always had a horrid UI, requiring mods to use fully, but I thought that was going to be improved and streamlined for X Rebirth?), you can't really quickly see what's going on with your ships and the trades and so forth. Also due to the horrid UI, it will never compete with the old X games as a fleet simulator game either, since it's virtually impossible to organize and order your ships to do anything.  All in all, don't buy X Rebirth yet. Wait until the bugs are fixed (if ever) and buy it when it's cheaper and try to play it at its own merits, and not an X game. Hopefully Egosoft will realize their folly and release a proper X game in the future.",

            "review_text": "So in short, this is one of the best single player space sims out there. Highly reccommended if you love the genre. What I think most people that wrote a negative review did is that they reviewed the early game (which was in fact buggy, slow as hell and generally undeveloped) and most important - they compared it to their predecessor X3: Terran Conflict (X3TC). More explanation below if you care to read.  X3TC is simply the best single player space sim out there, period. Rebirth is a different game that borrows some things from its predecessor but is essentially completely new. Most people (including myself) expected just a better X3TC which, thinking back, would in fact be almost impossible to achive (in my opinion). So what made me play X:Rebirth so much? Because is without doubt one of the best space sims out there. Most of similar games have a much shorter life span, meaning that you reach a point when there's simply nothing to do. X:R is a sandbox. You decide your own rules, you shape the universe (literally), you can play it almost infinitely.  Want to ruin the economy in AI controlled sectors? You do it. Wanna be a hoarder and own every acquirable ship and every buildable station in the game? You do it. Wanna play the pirate that plunders one or more factions? You do it. Wanna have a fleet of 500 capital ships and lay waste to the entire universe? Well you can do it but it's not permanent since the AI will eventually rebuild space stations.  After almost 400 hours of gameplay I still find many things to do, many things that would get me occupied for at least 100 more hours. And then I'd set myself a new goal and play 100 hours more. Like I said, the game is a sandbox. Play the story mode once, and then start a new game and set yourself some personal goals and rules to stick to - i.e. play a merchant that cannot own any combat ship and can only defend itself if attacked. or play a pirate that plunders all but one or two factions.  Compared to some other space sims I've played (and I've played many) X:R is not the best but it's in the top 5 for sure.  Pros: - you can acquire almost everything you see in the universe - it's a sandbox so basically infinite lifespan - combat is dynamic and fun - combat can be HARD if not approached without a plan - you can't just go in alone and fight a destroyer with escorts. They will rip you apart in seconds regardless of your ship mods. - build, fight, trade and THINK - sometimes you face an ingame problem that might seem as a bug, but it can be resolved ingame (i.e. resource shortage and the economy won't produce the affected resource - once you're familiar with the game mechanics, you can solve this by yourself)) - the interface has been GREATLY improved since the game came out and is now really user-friendly  Cons: - only one flyable ship - but in the long run it doesn't matter that much because you always end up flying one most of the time - can't really customize the fleet (i.e. different weapons for your ships)",

Core Bad:  -AI is a step back, not improved  -Pathing is a joke, noclip is being used to hide poor AI path-finding  -There is a noticeable memory leak, game pegs at 3.2gb and crashes once LAA hard-code is hit.  -Xbox code is everywhere, it has been suggested the game actually runs inside an Xbox emulator for our PCs, however I have not seen evidence that is true yet. The design at its core was definitely for Xbox360 first and XMath library calls are still active in the code (which PCs can't use)  -Game design flaws (one ship)  -XML parser is having a hell of a time keeping up with read/build requests and it shows in game.

Be warned tho, you'll find yourself 'a few minutes' into the game and look up to find your whole afternoon gone.  This game has a depth and scope like no other and is definitely worthy of your time, you will just need alot of it to get to where you'd like to be in the game and able to explore the vastness of the game's options.  Pros: -Vast scope that provokes no end of questions and inspires interest. -Beautiful space-scape. -Immersive environment with countless options for progression.  Cons: -Very poor campaign that bugs out on nearly every objective leaving you unable to continue. If you choose to play it get a guide and follow it to the letter any deviation and its game over. -The game from a personal perspective isn't as inspiring as from your ship, stations feel a little lifeless and labarythine. -Learning curve is steep and the tutorial whilst a good effort lacks a little, such as being told to shoot asteroids is all very well if you already know the control to press to do it...

It's a shame that things didn't work out to the expectations of people from day one, however X-Universe games have never been 100% from day one. They are bit like a fine wine that takes a while to mature, so if you get one too earlier you have to keep it around somewhere for a bit before you can truly enjoy it.  It can be said with that, X-Rebirth is now a Vintage and it's had a fine year in regards to how Egosoft has been busy turning it around.  While there will still be small things that grate on people, there is still alot of potential with the game and it's continually tweaked engine. It's worth a buy if you are into space trading/fighting and empire building simulators.",

            "review_text": "Yes and no.  It's very different from most games around, and even different from most space sims around too. Complex and indepth, the game clearly has potential for those who have interest, but the learning curve and rough edges can be initially offputting (or entirely).  It is and isn't my sort of game; it looks like the sort of game you invest a lot of time into over a long period of time, versus the sort of game that throws you straight into the action - a game that potentially requires that you have a lot of free time on your hands, both for playing and possibly for learning stratergies and initially the basics.  My initial impressions were good and it appears that most of the reviews are due to people A. not being able to launch the game or B. due to problems and bugs I haven't yet experienced or were long fixed in previous patches.  Haven't had any issues at all after my very limited playtime (I did play an hour or two which isn't recorded in offline mode due to my internet going poof), though the game does seem very slow with quite a lot of mechanics - probably a very good game, but not the sort you can sink into casually without some effort and learning. Probably the sort of game you play for a good few hours before you can really begin to enjoy it as the ropes seem a little difficult to get the game of.  Some notes:  - Voice acting is terrible. There is literally only a handful of lines for generic npcs and overall the quality of the voiceacting is off (characters all seem emotionless and repeat the same lines).  Not sure why they did not settle with text instead of voice acting. Would have (in my opinion) improved the game if they just stuck with text chat in windows for communication (think Stalker, where only specific unique characters have voice chat, generic characters are just text).  - Playing through the campain - pretty tedious as you mostly move around doing one job or another. I wonder a little if the game is built more for free play than story. That, and whilst looking for crew members, a swarm of hostiles keeps taking out my ship &amp; capital ship...  - Seems to be some performance issues. Probably related to my crappy CPU. AMD FX4100 &amp; a GTX770 - can't run above medium without the game turning into a lag fest.  - You can walk around stations. Initially cool, but very quickly lost interest in the concept after a few times -- they all basically look the same inside and have the 'same people' in the regard that each and every npc has the same tiny set of voices and conversations (please oh lord, quit with the '40 years we didn't even have highways!')  - The GUI is terrible, in my honest opinion. Often lacking visiblity and ease of access, the GUI/UI overall is a right mess - it has strange ways of functioning and has made me accidently shoot stuff I intended to communicate to/interact with.  = Slow paced gameplay. May or may not be your thing - it depends on how much time you have available. For example, I started and escort mission and half an hour later I was still escorting a ship. Got bored in the end and quit, but that is because of impatience and lack of time.  + Atmosphere seems overall good. Well, bar the poor voice acting. Combat is typical space shooter, so nothing special in that regard, which I have no issue with.  + Mods. Always a plus for me when a game has a modding community.  I won't recommend it to people like me, but I can see exactly why people  do  like it, which is why I'm giving an overall recommendation. The game is good for what it is, but I currently don't have the time and patience to sit down and learn the ropes and immerse myself - in the future I might, but for now I do not.",

X:Rebirth, despite it's rough start might be a passably good game by now...'.  You would be wrong.  Playing X:Rebirth is like when you're out by yourself and nature calls in a bad way, you must go NOW... and all you can find is a porta-potty. Apprehension sets in, like you're sitting on a huge heap of human waste separated only by a flimsy board and the cheapest possible plastic container.  You summon you're courage, heading in and you flip the knob from open to unavailable. “This might not be so bad” you think... Just like you'll think in X:Rebirth. You start going about your businesses then, out of nowhere... &lt;WHAM!!!&gt; the world is spinning! You're falling forward, some unspeakably evil human being has knocked the porta-potty over on you and not only that, it has landed on the door!!! You're trapped in a sludge of brown, blue and black which is now raining down upon your prostrate self, covering your naughty parts with unmentionable filth.  The guttural sound that emerges from your now agony and rage filled self is how you'll feel when you realize you paid MONEY for this game. They didn't even pay YOU but you paid them. At least if a gorilla throws their excrement at someone, that person has an interesting story (and a dirty face). With X:Rebirth, there is NO redeeming value.

If they released another copy of Albion prelude with better missions, voice acting, station building mechanics, playability, more ships (with cockpits) and a good story I would have happily paid $40. They should stop trying to make the new game mechanics work and invest their time on the next X series game.

However at current state this is a game I am having difficulty putting it down. The stations are huge and it is possible to play this game 120+ hours and never even see half of the content becuase there is just so much out there.   Being as I started in the X series with X3 shortly before rebirth came out and have 500 plus hours of gametime in terran conflict and Albion Prelude the best thing I can say about rebirth is that you don't start off as cannon fodder any time you are in a fight. You can also gain enough credits early enough to actually do missions without tedious side jobs. Also there is a storyline it may be slightly cheezy (what spacegame isn't) it was a very enjoyable campaign which I have played many times.  The negative reviews of this game early were indicative of a game that no longer exists as the improvements over the last few months have solved almost all issues.  Best things about game  Developer standing behind product - as they have done with previous products Open space Player has an effect on the universe Capitial ship combat Crafting wares  Drones and their functions, each one is different and handles different jobs Exploration - you can literally fly several thousand kilometers away from sectors and still find things Individual modules on both ships and stations allow for strategy as opposed to kamakizee The 'business' side where planning and proper development of stations or trades can make or break you  Worst things  Odd highway glitch when the system is being asked to load all the graphical resources for the next area Occasional Framerate drops - I7 4770K and Radeon R290 + 32 GB of ram should take care of these things but it doesen't  some mindless chatter is repetitive The loss of some of the races from the previous games - Future expansion may bring them back? some employee options are very gender/race specific Yisha - I want to put her back in the pod she came in on and blast it out into deep space more often than not ",

I went back to this game haveing no lore of the other X games and after about 8 hours of frustration and a few youtube videos as well as the mods they now have for the game it is REALLY enjoyable and bug free as far as I can tell. Kudos to the Devs for sticking with a broken mess and makeing an enjoyable game tho it perhaps should have been more tested before release, but they are a smaller studio. As for the other X games perhaps after my time on this one i will revisit them. 8/10 Perhps higher but their is a bit of a learning curve, just stick with it and the game really opens up.",

If you've already bought the game, I wouldn't bother waiting for incremental patches on this one - come back around April or March '14 and see then if X Rebirth is worth playing. Also, be sure to check out the community mods.  Until then, I recommend paying no more than $10 for this game, and cross your fingers that the next game in the X series actually remembers what an X game is. Terran Conflict or Albion Prelude are entirely different games, and remain reasonably worthy purchases.",

My main gripe against rebirth is that they limited you to one ship, I get why, but it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It is cool you can control multiple ships though. All in all it's shaping up to be a good game and performance is ~37 FPS Maxed out with 2xAA at 3840x2160 on my 780TIs; at 1920x1080p @144Hz I get 57 FPS average maxed out. I would recommend this game to anybody who is dismayed by the absolute lack of game in Elite Dangerous, that's why I revisited this one and I'm glad I did. It has way more substance, you can go into the space stations, hunt for minerals, trade, do bounties, do escort missions, capture ships, the list is pretty comprehensive. The graphics are still pretty darn good other than the character models. I actually found this game far more immersive than the dead world of ED. Now I've only got 4.4 hours in so far, so if I find anything untoward I will update this, but so far runs well and plays awesome.",

It doesn't crash every five minutes and for the most part the most ridiculous and game breaking bugs appear to be fixed now that it's been out for more than a year.  Is it actually enjoyable though? Definitely not, unless you have a strong sadistic urge, you most likely won't enjoy this AT ALL. Be prepared to wait hours upon hours for stuff to actually happen, cope with a ridiculously unintuitive user interface that requires you to click options for 5 minutes to do the most simplistic things imaginable and other highly annoying things to that nature.  The previous games actually had sensibly structured menues and allowed you to configure hotkeys for every single important function you would ever need and then quite a few more. With this though? No Hotkeys whatsoever. Heck even within the dialogs it's ridiculously unintuitive. Press Enter to confirm stuff and/or make stuff actually happen? You'd better forget about that. Enter get's replaced by 4 in most of the dialogs, unless of course you hit one of the many exceptions to this rule when it's some random other number key or, in very rare circumstances, they actually stuck with the proven Enter key. Hit Escape to go back? Not so much in this game. The list actually goes on and on, but suffice to say that the UX is actually the worst one could possibly imagine for any game to have.  Which leads to actually having to answer the question about whether or not it's playable with 'no' since the UX is so freaking terrible, there are no words for it.  Remote trading is pretty much gone, for like the first 10 hours or so there doesn't seem to be any way to remote trade or control anything. It continues to be this way until, by accident / pure luck, you spot the top part of the Trade dialog actually has an option to select one of several (not all) of your ships to do the trade. After you did that, you'll have to wait for endless hours for it to actually do it. Since there is no SETA anymore you're actually forced to sit there and wait, or do other stuff in the real world (as you can't use your PC since it has to run X). So yeah, I ended up going outside playing some Ingress sessions while the game was running waiting for your stupid ships to actually do something you are required to do and wait for.  You can pretty much forget about fighting too, your ship is way to weak under any circumstances and pretty much uncontrolable in any fashion required to be able to dogfight, which unfortunately is being pretty heavily focused in the storyline so far. So be prepared to die A LOT, until you're so frustrated by even just flying around that you either say screw this piece of $60+ ♥♥♥♥ or go and make yourself invulnerable by means of cheating.    Long story short: DO NOT BUY THIS! Go buy any of the previous titles really, they're fine and you will have lots of fun with the previous titles. They have a logical and sensible UI, and even though it might seem a lot at first it actually provides a good UX. This one however has the most terrible UX &amp; UI that has ever been created in the history of mankind and unfortunately that cannot ever be fixed.  If you absolutely want this to complete your collection of X titles then maybe get it when it's on sale for less than like $5 or something. Anything more than that is simply not worth it.",

This game, like each of its predecessors, is a tragic mess, a classic spreadsheet game where nothing happens for hours but numbers go up. It's got all these amazing elements but they simply do not come together. X Rebirth is a more constricted world than the previous games, and tries to be more cinematic, but in the words of one of the guys on their steam forums is 'still a buggy game full of grandmas.' Pretty much all the NPCs are old ladies who say really rude 90s things (good to see you... NOT!) to you. this sounds like it is hilarious, and it is, but it's not worth paying money for it.

If you want dogfighting in space, there are more superior alternatives to X Rebirth, since dogfighting in this game is very rudimentary and isn't the focus. But for space enterprising, you'll currently find no better modern franchise than the X series. X3 and X Rebirth are the best wholesome space sim games out there. You will build massive station complexes, amass great fleets and compete with NPC factions in both capitalism and glorious combat.  Pros and cons between X3 and X Rebirth? X3 is starting to show its age, especially compared to X Rebirth. But its age is also its biggest advantage. X Rebirth can't hold a candle to X3's universe and economy simulation, but X Rebirth is constantly receiving updates and is inching closer to being a reasonable alternative to its older brother other than in the eye candy department.  As of right now, the economy in X Rebirth simply is not working. The game cheats in order to mask this up, so everything you do ultimately feels inconsequential as the game just does whatever it wants anyway. X3 is no different in that the NPC factions will cheat back their destroyed stations and ships, but there are mods out there to rectify this. The economy in vanilla X3 is fully functional.  The story in X Rebirth is no masterpiece by any means, but it helps to get you to the meat of the game; cultivating your personal empire. The story also attempts to introduce you to and explain the backstory of the universe you now occupy, if this interests you.  Both X3 and X Rebirth are officially gamepad supported, but in both games you will inevitably spend a lot of time navigating menus regardless of what control scheme you pick. Such is the nature of economy-driven games. Keep this in mind.  X Rebirth is also very performance heavy. Once you get the proverbial snowball rolling, there will be a LOT of things in the game for your computer to keep track of. You'll need parts well beyond the recommended specs to enjoy a smooth experience.  Despite its issues, this game will easily hold you over for a good 50-100 hours before any of the showstoppers rear their heads. Though once everything has been ironed out, X Rebirth will be one of the go-to singleplayer space sim games of this generation.",

But then I started to slow down. I'm not focused on GOTTA GO FAST. I'm actually finally flying my ship instead of using it as a robot courier.  The Skunk is also a decent ship. I really miss jumping into my capitol and watching the main cannons disintegrate targets, but the Skunk shoves you right into the action and even on the harder difficulties it's pretty easy to survive.  So would I recommend this game? It's made space gorgeous again. People keep talking about Freelancer, but I'll stick with X for as long as I can.",

            "review_text": "Maybe as with some of the other X-Universe titles, Rebirth will become a decent game in time, but for now I simply cannot recommend it -- and I do not like giving bad reviews because I know behind every product is a team that did try to make it work. Unfortunately, there is ample evidence that Rebirth was originally an attempted XBox 360 release, including XBox 360 controller support, but none for joysticks (unlike every other X-game since X2: The Threat). The code, the graphics, the general gameplay all say 'console game' to me -- and my own theory is Rebirth was supposed to come out in 2007. Sure, the space backdrops are pretty -- but they were, in my opinion, just as pretty in X3: Reunion, a game released in 2005.  There are more things wrong with Rebirth than right. - You have to scour station exteriors to find what's sold, then find a dock (which are no longer obvious), land, go inside, and locate the one NPC selling the item you want to buy. And the NPC graphics are laughably crude, with no more than a half dozen identical models. Station interiors feel like gulags. And the NPCs all talk like surly prisoners; heck, I'd be surly too if I had to spend my entire life on a space station that looks like a prison. - Speaking of identical models, well, that's the space stations, factories and whanot. Each one looks exactly like every other one. So yeah, if you go to all four sectors and all the systems and individual sites in the sectors, there are some 110 specific locales to visit. Seems like a lot. However, except for whatever planet or star or nebula is nearby and what specifically is being sold, they're all really the same. - Characters: They all hate you. Every single one. Try to have a polite conversation with an NPC to buy some ship parts and they respond like snotty teenagers. 'A pleasure doing business... NOT!' The only person who has any affection at all for you is your co-pilot. Who mostly makes dumb remarks. - Apparently the X-Universe has suffered a devolution in technology overall. No more gates zapping you from point A to point B in an instant; now it takes minutes on these new 'space highways' (including a really stupid tailgating minigame). No more ship radar -- tech that was available in the very first X game, more than a decade ago. Dog-fighting has become an arcade game. Oh, and targeting is a total joke. - Egosoft -completely- forgot the lesson they learned as early as the first expansion, X:panded: That players want to fly more than one ship during the entire course of the game. That's right -- in Rebirth, you get only one ship to fly. And it's ugly. And there's no HUD, no way to fly your ship without static cockpit graphics chewing up 1/3 of your screen, with tiny, easy to miss indicators buried in the obscuring digital cruft. - User Interface: It remains terrible. The same key will do half a dozen different things depending on the context, and few of them are obvious. It is also impossible to remap many of the functions to other keys. Menus, if anything, are worse than they were in X3. - Other unbelievable design decisions: Looting boxes and air-vents for random junk and money, acts of outright theft completely ignored by station security standing right next to you. Having to land to buy -anything-, as with gates and radar, apparently the X-Universe denizens have forgotten how to use radios. Pointless transitions. Mind-numbing repetition in every detail of the game. - Bugs. Game breaking bugs. As is all too common nowadays, a pre-beta game was rushed out the door.  Anyway, I could go on and on about my regrets in paying full retail for this game. I still have them. Want to have some fun playing a challenging space sim? Get a copy of one of the X3 games and deal with the steep initial learning curve. But all three of the X3 games are well-patched and have lots of player-generated add-ons to aid with gameplay.  Or wait for Star Citizen. Like I'm doing.",

They simply either dont exist or just dont work. I would strongly suggest you think acrefully before considering to buy this game.  The game randomly crashes, lags heavily in places and has display issues with key interactive elements like the terminal disappearing and being unable for use - the fix being save/reload visit the crew area bump into the door and go back to the cockpit. Then the terminal reappears.  Edit Savefile Meta Game  In order to progress and ATTEMPT to fix your woeful ingame problems many advocate 'editing the savefile'. This takes the form of using a word processor to edit an XML file containing the save data of the game. The format would be confusing to most and is inherantly frustrating and prone to errors. In my personal attempts to get the game to work I edited this file hundreds of times. In my stats I reloded the game 216 times in less then 7 dyas.  Combat.  The only functionality in game that works is some combat - although some enemies do nothing, your other ships dont fight, your friendly fleet members dont fight etc.  Further you can only put a few weapons on your ship and only one of each type. Some of the combat graphics for some weapons is nothing but silly and annoying with pulse masers having a ridiculous wavy line thing obscuring most of the left hand side of the screen.  Boarding captial ships is initially some fun - however you can kill a capital ship very easily by just sitting behind the engines and shooting or flying in the dock area and shooting.  Movement  In previous game you were able to pilot what ship you wanted, fit it out as you wanted, dock it where you wanted etc.  However in X Rebirth you are only able to fly one ship. You are unable to get other craft to dock, fly where you want, autopilot anywhere, fight, patrol, trade - the only thing they currently do is follow you and mostly die. Even ships you build or own will die to a single random fighter of any kind because they dont fight back.  Trade  The only ships which seemed to be able to trade were the Medium Class traders of which I had 1 given me via the campaign and 1 I managed to get through combat - that extra one took me two days. In order to get the ship back to my 'safe area' I had to edit the save file and turn off enemy standings so it could actually fly to safety.  I shot about 100+ ships in this process and got 1. So it's not a practical. For the 100s of combat ships I played against I got 2 free ships. You are unable to repair them nor fit them out nor will they fight/patrol/dock etc.  The trading screen show wares you are 'aware of' to be aware you need to fly around stations and look at icon points on the oustside. However over time these disappear and you have to go do the same thing again. To get better prices you have to examine ( i ) points around the station - the more you have examined the more discount are unlocked - but you have to get them by flying around the selling and docikning ponts again. If you leave the zone some of these points reset and you'll have to do it all again. Further after a few hours in game play all of the discounts and selling information disappears - even if you have a ship trading with the station - which I had 1.  If you try and use freighters they dock but are unable to transfer goods - and so do nothing.  Despite my best efforts trading doesnt work and is a complete joke compared to previous X games.   I tried to tell you about the rest of the game but Steam limits the amount of text so I cant,,, bascially all functions are bugged or missing.",

Sadly the only good thing I can say about it, is that the graphics while you are in space are nice...   I REALLY tried to like this game. Most of my play was in free play. So, to start, you only get to fly the one ship, and I thought 'OK. The they want you to take more of an administrative role. I can do that.' Off I go to get a trade ship. So, I look at the list of ships, and find that you need certain ships to trade certain goods. Again I think. 'Ok. I can see that. Kinda makes sense.' I figure I will start with bulk goods. Then I see how much it cost to build even the cheapest trading ship. 'Ok. Guess I need to take a direct role with my one ship and quest for a while to earn the money to be able to be a merchant.' So off I go, spending 2 days trying to earn the money to build a ship. I go back to the ship yard and order my ship. 'Ok. It will take some time to build.' I come back 2 hours later to the ship yard, and it is still a 0%. At this point I load up Chrome to see whats up. Turns out, that the ship yard didn't have the parts need to build the ship. The games 'fully simulated economy' didn't replenish the goods in the shipyard... ever.... The usual answer to fix this problem is to bring goods to the station yourself. The one and only ship I you have in free-play can't move the goods you need...   So, at this point I am 3 days of play in, and the ONLY thing I can do is play as a space shooter. If I wanted a space shooter, I would go play Miner Wars, because, despite it's bad reviews, at least it doesn't make much pretence of being more then a shooter, And, it only costs $20 instead of $50.   If you are looking for what this game promised, go get it's parents, X3: Terran Conflict + the Albion Prelude add on. If you get the 'X3 Terran War Pack' the two of them together cost $20. A very complex game, but worth the time to figure out. Egosoft would have been much better off updating the engine they used for this one instead of making the new one. At least then the reviews would have ready. 'Just another update to an old engine, but it's still a fun game and worth the buy.' instead of 'Don't wast your money on this game. It is badly broken, and even if they fix the bugs there is no real game here.'",

The game doesn't refresh it's resource usage creating a very laggy enviroment after a few hours of game time. In my case I have to close the game after 3 hours to avoid overloading the memory. Another important think is the trade witch takes hours due to the fact that trading ship must undock the dock again at a station to complete the trade orders. So if you want to buy 3 types of drones from the same factory you can easly expect the trade to take some 2 hours of wasted game time. Other isues can be seen in the patch hystory. So sorry EGOSOFT for these reasons I can't recommend this game.",

A few go rounds of this later I tried some missions and bought some ships.  After a bit of XML work on my wallet finally started on the Build Station mission I had grabbed towards the start......thats where it got tedious and questionable...44 million just to start the station for a 3 million reward?  My construction ship plowed through the build for a total of 16 hours, with me assisting via XML edits of the station inventory...  Saw a few NPC's attacking and decided to create a fleet to guard my construction vessel....scripts are sorely lacking for fleet management and utilization...my fleets construction drones lay dormant while my construction ship whittled away on the build, even having the Architect controlling said fleet had no effect. Engineers on your capital ship...nope they can't fix your hull or any of your interceptors in your fleet...  Want to click your capital ship in the map...here is the nearest station learn about it instead of your ship...

X rebirth had a lot of potential and alot of good ideas, unfortunately none and i do mean NONE of them turned out well. This is a game that is maybe half finished and after 7 years in development you would not think that to be the case. So lets name off a few aspects of this game that were never finished  NPC look like something you would have seen from a 1999 game and half the time they miss their animations and skip around.  The inside of all station and ships are extremely poor and bland.  The UI in this game is the worse to date of any X game.  The combat is only so so nothing special and often very laggy  Very poor optimization even the best rigs will struggle to play this outdated looking game.  Voice acting in all of the X game's has been pretty bad but X rebirth takes the prize for wost voice  acters in the X series just horrible.

            "review_text": "To start, I have never played an ‘X’ game before, other than a few little bits on X3 and watching a couple of lets plays. So, I’m new to the series, and X-Rebirth being the most recent incarnation, I thought it best to start there. With that said, let us get to the gritty details.  X-Rebirth is a space/sci-fi sandbox game which allows the player freedom to roam off into the multiple galaxies and do pretty much whatever they feel like. When the game was first released, I found it severely lacking in all areas, coupled with the fact my last PC couldn’t really deal with it too well, so the majority of my playing experience is from the 2.0 patch “Secret Service Missions”. Currently I have logged over 30 hours in the campaign.   Now, visually the game has to be rated in 2 parts. Externally (in space) I quite enjoy the looks of the game, the stations, the lighting flares, other ships are pretty detailed, and overall it looks polished and aesthetically pleasing. Inside the cockpit of the Albion Skunk (the player ship) is also quite detailed and many of the different ‘skins’ you can use for it are also very different, and provide a nice change. However it’s not all fun and gravy. Once you land at a station you’re allowed to roam the station in first person mode, opening lockers and crates for loot to sell, and talk to NPC shop merchants and the like. It is around here that the visual and audio problems start for me. The stations are woefully copy pasted, with such minor differences that they all feel the same. There are maybe 6 different designs and they’re copy pasted liberally. The level of detail here I also feel takes a hit, with the station looking and feeling bleak, bare, and devoid of life. Then there are the NPCs themselves. This game has, and I cannot stress this part enough, the *worst* voice acting and dialogue in any game I have ever played. It sounds like they had a total of 6 voice actors, read 3 lines each and then just applied those sound bites to all NPCs in the game. There is no variety and even your player character sounds terrible. The small talk minigame also doesn’t sit right with me in this game, though the principle is okay. Click the mouse when the line reaches the optimal position and you come up with something to say that impresses the NPC. However, the NPCs only have about 4 topics of conversation, all say the same lines, and after you’ve spoken literally 2 sentences, they say something like “I haven’t had such scintillating conversation in years!” ...Really? Two lines of generic dialogue and you’re willing to be best buds? Back to visuals however, the NPCs look like plastic, with terrible movement animation and I don’t even think they attempted lip-syncing. All of this wouldn’t be so much of a problem, were it not for the fact that you need to run around space stations to find vendors to sell your inventory items, and each vendor only deals in one specific item type, so you need to speak to 4-5 NPCs each time you dock.  Next – movement and UI. The movement inside the ship is quite good, I personally like to use the mouse scroll wheel to control speed, rather than X and Z, but the movement seems pretty solid, though when I briefly switched to a 360 controller, it seemed a lot less responsive. When out of the ship, your character controls like a 3 legged donkey on a skateboard. The UI can be a bit daunting at first, but once you get used to it, it does work quite well for what you can do, so I can’t complain too much there.  At many of the stations you can unlock trade routes, to make money, and missions of varying types such as patrolling and area, transporting personnel, or more typical “go kill this dude” each one increasing your reputation with the many, many different factions. If your reputation drops too low (ie: by killing ships of that faction) you will become their enemy, and they will attack you on site, making reputation something that needs to be managed. Trade missions I find a little tough to get into. You need to buy/build a form of transport/cargo ship that will (when ordered) pick up items from location A and sell at location B, with the player having to search through all their known trade locations and selecting the best price and selling at an area with high demand. It seems that this side is quite time consuming, and to make any serious money you need to invest heavily in time and money. That being said it does seem to work fairly well once you get it going. However, an alternate way to make money is just sit in your ship using ‘Long Range Scanning’, picking up cargo containers drifting through space. This seems to be the quickest, most efficient way to make millions, which I think is a balancing problem.  Now, the more meaty stuff: Gameplay. I find this one hard to get into because my opinion varies as I play. The campaign itself is absolutely terrible so far. Partially due to the fact that you’re exposed to a lot of the voice acting, and the dialogue is terrible. However, what compounds the issue is that the story just doesn’t seem to be anything more than a very, very long winded tutorial, wrapped around a thin plot line that at one point sets your reputation so far into the red with a major faction, you have to pretty much run through the galaxy. This is something I can’t get on with, because it feels like the campaign isn’t how the game is meant to be played, it simply reaffirms the belief that it’s simply a bad tutorial. Free play mode is open from the get go, so this might be a better way to play, but you’ll have to do a lot of reading in the manual etc to understand the many different menus and mechanics. Exploring the different sectors and zones can feel like fun at first, but very quickly descends into tediousness, having to get 3cm away from an ‘Info’ point to unlock discounts at the station, that even then only last for 60 minutes. Ship-to-ship combat is quite good, and the AI seems to have a good understanding of rolling, and throttle control now, and with multiple difficulties I can see that it can be quite fun. With all that said, one of my biggest gripes with this game is that the player only ever gets to fly the one ship. A game of this size should allow a lot more variety than that, especially when it has been a feature of previous games in the series. They say the Albion Skunk is ‘highly customisable’, to which I say “Shut up”. You have 3 different types of shields (balanced, high capacity, and a quick recharge), 3 types of engines (balanced, speed, manoeuvrability) 3 different scanners, 1 piece of software upgrade (Trade Computer) and weapons? Well Several different types of missiles, and 4 different laser weapons, of which only one weapon can be used at a time. To me, that isn’t even scratching the surface of customisation. There are still some bugs, but I have had almost no experience of them myself in 2.0, but I have had about 4 full game crashes, so some progress has been made.  So, to the conclusion (finally). I like the ideas that this game has, and I think that it has a lot of potential to be a really fantastic game. Things like shooting out a capital ship’s engines and external turrets and launching a squad of marines to board and capture the ship really excites me. Mining, trading and building my own space station, also sounds really cool. In practice however, I feel that so many of these ideas just fall short of expectation, or are bogged down by too much hindrance to be considered fun. Maybe, if the developers keep patching the game, we’ll see a solid working build one day, but currently in 2.0 I’d say they have taken a good step forward, but it’s a long walk to their destination. So, would I recommend this game? All things considered, I’d have to say ‘no’, but I want to like it, and I do get the urge to play it, so perhaps for some it might be a ‘yes’.",

I am a longtime egosoft fan starting with X: BTF, and I was among the masses more than looking forward to this game and claiming I would be disappearing from the world at launch. Sadly, this didnt happen. Launch was a disaster, crashing and save game edit requirements being among the forefront of the issues. That being said however, Egosoft seems to be working hard to bring the game in line with a true 'Release' quality build and, as always, the community is hard at work to mod whatever they want into the game as well as changing what they view as needing change.  Hopefully with further support this game can come to be something closer to the anticipated game.  To elaborate on my beginning notes - what I thought while playing it:  (Just to get this out of the way) The single ship thing does bother me as I have gotten used to the previous titles ability to pilot whatever is available. However, I do like the attempt to make that single ship something worth upgrading - they just need to broaden the options beyond their simple Mk1 Mk2 Mk3 Mk4 setup.  'Player owned Ships' and their crew - Fortunately the ships are starting to respond properly (Especially with the mods available) and I do like the idea of hiring the 'command' crew of the ship (I say that because i like to think the ship has more than 3 people on it, especially the bigger container ships and cruisers) and, while it does get tedious, it does play to the micromanager in me. - Trading is a bit of a pain, and while updates have been making it easier, I have been forced to turn to the community to make this something worth doing. -I have to say that despite any issues with control over the ships, once you get your warships into a fight its quite a sight (Given they attack what you want them to - i believe a recent update allowed for this) with the heavy beams against larger craft and chain guns against fighters. -Building stations can be a pain, while the idea of the construction ship being able to buy from merchants to get what it needs is nice, it never seems to work - especially in Devrise. Keep in mind that I do not believe you should be able to autopilot and have a station magically appear, I do like that there are so many materials needed and you have to work for your station. I just have an issue with the apparent 'WE ARE BUYING THIS AND THIS AND THIS!!' not seeming to work with the NPCs.  Now the storyline: You start off well enough. Random event leading to you getting embroiled in x and y story. However, as it progresses there are so many fragments and seeming skips in what you can tell Should be there and isnt that you get lost trying to figure out how you went from problem A to problem B and both being fixed with Solution C...yet not really. While i understand there is supposed to be an episodic nature to the game...where is the rest of the first episode?   Again i still wish there was a Maybe button. I'm recommending this title with the note that it is still a work in progress and has a lot of potential, but if you do pick this up head straight for the modding forums as there are plenty of options to make this game more appealing.",

Also, the subtitles pop up and disappear almost 5 seconds before the actual thing is said. (like, why?)  Second, CONTROLS ARE NOT RESPONSIVE at all...once you are outside the ship. Apparently I can pilot my ship better than I can pilot my head, nevermind my body. I don't know, maybe it's just my computer, but hey, when my ship turns faster than my head, I think there are some problems.   Other than those issues, I quite like the game.

            "review_text": "X Rebirth. Lets get something clear, this is a vastly different direction from X3:TC/AP. Only three systems that you can visit, but this game does several things that the previous games do not.  1: Space is big.  With the previous games, each system could easily be crossed in a minute or two before reaching jumpgates. In this particular game, each region is massive. The stations are huge and modular, can fight back, and can be precision disabled instead of outright destroyed easily. You can find ships by the hundreds, making space feel less empty. Speaking of stations...  2: Improving infrastructure is no small deal.  In the last game, all you needed to do to build a station is buy a prefab set, hire or buy a ship large enough to carry the parts, and just plop it down anywhere you like. Here, you can't just build anywhere you like, which is more realistic. Plus, once you plce down a blueprint, you have to obtain all the materials needed to build the structure. In addition, after you build the station, you can expand on it further using the same methods. Every station is going to be dependant on others for one thing or another, you can't just build a megaplex that takes care of itself. Unfortunately, this leads to some problems in the storyline.  3: You can't do everything yourself.  You only have one ship, and its more a fighter then a cargo ship. Granted, this is a bit of a downer as being able to fly any ship you like was one of the more enjoyable parts of prior games. Fleets are also fairly small and mostly freighters instead of fleets of destroyers. Managing your fleets isn't simple, and too clunky for my tastes.  4: The economy...  Is a joke. Trading isn't easy and can't be automated, and isn't profitible in the end. Your best bet is to turn to piracy/bounty hunting and jack freighters. There hasn't been any other decent source of money.  In the end, you can't build up to be a force that matches the major governments. If you dive into the lore, the limited number of systems makes sense, and is a bit worrying if you really think about this. This is mostly a very clunky game that has been too long in development and doesn't nearly match the standards of todays games. Maybe if it was released back in 2007...",

Now, they have fixed every aspect in the game that I have experienced so far. I am running a few items from the workshop, which refine it a bit more, but the core of the game is now believable.  I have played a lot of space games, and I'm not sure what it is that I'm looking for when I play them, but I often find myself playing this game for hours longer than I intended to, and during the whole time I can feel the attention to detail that went into making it an immersive universe.  Most of the characters in the stations still look like scary dolls, unfortunately, but they actually look a lot more like the pasty spacefaring folk from previous X titles, and less like unfinished character models.  Voice acting has been vastly cleaned up, but there are still some instances of line delivery where the voice actor obviously didn't have any sense of context when they delivered the (sometimes terribly written) lines.  The key aspect for me, though, is immersion. In that sense, X-Rebirth is really becoming something special.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a game of much potential, but like all Egosoft games before it, it's not quite ready out of the gate. While there are some who believe Egosoft has finally lost their edge (and all of their fanbase), the fact is, most of their true fans know to expect great aftersales support for a product that almost innevitably releases with bugs gallore.   Whether you should buy it now or wait relies mainly on your ability to be patient, and the level of love you have for space sims.",

People was therefore welcoming the change of the UI, to something a bit more fancy and open.But to that ! To summarize :  - Great, a cockpit ! WHY Can't we see out of it ! - Awesome ! Bars and stations to land on ! WHY only 3 models ? Why so few interaction ? Why stupidly looting the same space suits and entertainment consoles ? - Nice, lot of space craft traffick ! WHY just to queue and kill your frame rate ? - Smart, the highways ! WHERE are the crafts appearing and disappearing from on it ?  - interesting, cockpit HUD - but where is the radar, the clear map, the command bindings ? - One ship to fly with ONLY ? Cannot buy &amp; sell goods at one central place ? Market place looks like a dead stock market with 2 lost guys on it ?  - 5 weapons (including mining laser) ? 3 missiles types ? so few upgrades for your ship !   X Rebirth is the best example of the long awaited game that comes totally out of purpose. Like they didn't tested it, like there was no Beta to get the awful feedback of the players. And this even more cause everyone was so looking forward to it. Game updates will fix the crashes, but won't resolve the game lacks &amp; faults. A huge rescript could, but I doubt the game will even allow it. That's a lost occasion to release THE space sim. Guess we can only hope now on the First (and probably best) one, Elite serie. Check out for Elite Dangerous, under dev and hopefully planned for 2014.  Let's hope Egosoft will learn from their mistake, stop thinking they can release a popular space sim to be sold on next gen consoles and just do what they know to do.

I've gotta say, Omicron looks awesome! A close-up of a planet (rather than a split rock), stations with boosters on them to keep them in the sky, beatiful textures that really made the game seem more alive - and (finally!) a different station interior. If we'd started in Omicron, it would probably have some better reviews.  '2.5' Though is just some extra missions, for those that actually persevered/bothered to stay after the campaign - which I have to say was boring. I tried to build a station, and it cost 70 million!!!! How the hell can you trade and get that much? Even then I couldn't make money, it cost another 20 million to supply it.  My original review still stands I believe; it may get better, but for now just watch it, wait for the next game, or try X3. '2.5' is just another bug fix.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If you love Space Sims, X Rebirth will probably be one of your top games - just not yet.  Although this game does look spectacular, it appears EgoSoft released it a bit too early; currently there are multiple bugs, and it is difficult to understand, as well as play. However, there were multiple patches in the first few days, and EgoSoft is working to improve the game as much as possible based on player feedback.  For now, I recommend checking out X3: Terran Conflict, or X3: Albion Prelude, both are amazing games with beatiful teaxtures and are much more playable, albeit complicated. If you think X: Rebirth is a terrible game, then playing either will prove to you just how dedicated EgoSoft is to making all of their games work.",

In typical x fastion your given a large universe to make your own do everything from making your living thrugh trade and mining to being a bounty hunter or commanding a huge battle fleet. The game still retains the depth it has always had while lowing the learning curve so new players can easily get to grips with how the game works and then expand on that in thier way. you can now board space stations and interact with NPC`s recruiting crew for your stations and ships but there are some short falls here, indoors do not look as good as the amazing sectors you fly thru and there are only a few layouts to these stations and they are offten repeated and while any x player will tell you this is only a small part of the game and you will spend most of it flying your skunk it still does feel like it was a last minute attachment. Right now the game is being rapidly patched due to some preformance and AI issues but a developer from Egosoft has been updating people repeatedly on the steam forums and with time the game should be relativly bug free (the same problems did occur with X3 terran conflict). the game is worth playing but it might be worth waiting a few months untill some more patches have been thrown at it but to me this is one of the best X games there is and is worth your time.",

It took Egosoft almost two additional years after the original release to make the game actually worth playing.  There remain lots of 'but', though. You are still limited to one single ship and there are not plenty of customization options. Yes, you can chose to sacrifice shield strength for a faster regeneration, but that is basically it. Both player and NPC dialogues are still terribly awkward and the voice acting is in general a huge disappointment. Worse than X3, which was not exactly known for great acting.  However, the game has grown nicely in complexity. Runs without any problems even on (from today's perspective) dated machines in full details and offers some great space panoramas. The many little details you can find outside of stations or other points of interests are simply amazing (Elite Dangerous' stations pale in comparison). The station's inside, however, still suck as they did 2 years ago. Fortunately, the mechanics have changed so you will not need to actually walk inside stations very often. The plot still forces you to do this from time to time, but everything in free play can be done via remote coms.  The AAA price tag is still staggering. In a world, where games on steam usually get a big discount a few months after release, this is a weird thing to do. It is even weirder because at a $10 tag, I would recommend every space fan to giove it a try. But with the current price, while still recommending the game overall, I would suggest to wait for when the game goes on sale next.  6.5/10",

Your key method of navigating will be by entering space-highways (think Freelancer) where you tailgate traffic to gain speed. There is no auto-pilot to speak of, keyboard hotkeys are either missing or unbindable, and the UI itself is terrible; a radial menu with a 1 second delay (as in, menu disappears, calls up new radial menu), no mini-map OR radar, with a text font that blends into the menu background.  Combat is equally underwhelming; the ship you are restricted to for the entireity of gameplay has firepower equivalent to a light drone, while only being moderately shielded. Not that it matters, as you can outrun anything in it. Hostile and friendly ships may wig out entirely, simply sitting there doing nothing while their hull trickles down to 0. Or, get entire psychotic must-mount-all-the-geometry mode and dry hump a station to death. I wish I was kidding.  The primary piece of innovation to this product is the ability to walk around stations and specific ships(sections) while the rest of the game universe ticks over.

If not, you can enjoy the game as it is right now (consider though there are still bugs, some of them are game breaking. Egosoft is working on them, so yeah, bugged, but not unfixable).  If you are a X veteran, then this is more difficult to tell. I'm an X veteran, and I'm hugely disappointed with this X Rebirth. I guess I was expecting X4 (don't shout about 'they told it it wasn't x4'). I was expecting X4. I was expecting a new way to play, with a rich universe, filled with all the possibilities I had in X3AP or TC. It's not there at all.  Here are though some of my thoughts about the game :   - The graphics are beautiful (in space, in station I find them ugly, but once again, this is solely my opinion).  - The universe is big, but I don't feel like I'm in space (understand space, where there are a few station and lots of empty space). Stations are huge, I like that idea, but it feels like big cities now.  - The highways are a new neat way to move. It's a shame they block your view with a minigame (you drift behind vehicles to go faster. I would have prefered the neat view with no vehicles in front of me).  - They promised 'every ship in the game has a reason to exist. It does its thing'. While I can't argue this might be true for most of the big ships, I must say this isn't true at all for the ships that spawns in the highways, making it impossible to spy on other ships, see their venues and find what their routes are.  - There is only 1 playable ship (understand in which you can jump). You can control other ships, but it's really limited (against what X3 offered us).  - There are only 4 weapons for your ship.  - Only 4 regions, which are not truly dedicated to a faction. In X3, sectors were belonging to a faction. Here, the factions are mixed everywhere, making the game for the factions disappear.  - This Rebirth is more dedicated towards fighting. Of course you can mine, you can (try) making the economic play (very difficult, there is no real economy, it's more places where you can buy and sell more than a logical economy balanced by the player), or kill the pirates. But this game is more action packed then the X3AP was.  - Even if the idea of walking in station is nice, going inside stations and searching for the right guy is kinda weird for an x veteran. I need to ask the other ships in the game where I can find this man, rather than having a nice list of what you scanned as in X3.  These are in very short some things I think and feel about X Rebirth. I loved the game at start, and then when I saw there were no such possibilities as in X3, I felt I had the wrong game bought. But once again, this is my opinion on it.  I don't want to say this game is bad. A friend of mine is playing it, he never went in the X Universe, and he loves it. He hardly understand why I don't like it. So will you like this game ? I don't know. Read, and watch some gameplay about it on twitch, or youtube, make you see the game, and decide for yourself.",

A completely static animation for a cockpit zero flight stick control and I could just keep going and going and going on about how bad this game is.    DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Only 1 ship to fly, few weapon types, very little amount of upgrades for your ship, universe is MUCH smaller then it was in previous X games, and lot of game mechanics arent in the game any more or have been changed to become more accessable to bigger playerbase.",
