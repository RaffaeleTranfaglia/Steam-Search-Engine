Maybe only the pathing method would need some attention right now, but. Already very, very cool.  Nice foundation of a game.. i hope they will stay on track and add ladder rankings eventually, and such.  Pick this one up, worth your 10 bucks, it's polished.",

In my opinion this game has highly potential! Imagine 2vs2 Maps or maybe 3vs3. Could be very much fun to play with your friends.   I highly recommend this game to all people who like to play some quick games vs your friends or random people on the internet, specially for all RTS fans!   ",

In the first one all you have to do is 'Crush your Enemies', in the second one, you have to crush them while gathering resources. It's like a minimalistic and extremely basic RTS.  Unfortunately it kinda bored me near the end but i can't say is bad. Buy on sale.",
