While gameplay is simple enough and easy to learn, it still provides an enjoyable experience.  The only improvement for me is the difficulty; even in 'Insane' mode, I beat all levels with more than half time left.  Great game to have for bejeweled game lovers and achievement hunters.

            "review_text": "Quick summary: if you play casually in the easiest mode and do not care for achievement hunting, this is a FUN little game. Otherwise, be prepared to spend an awful LOT of time redoing some of those long levels!  These days I've been playing a lot of little match-3 games because they're quick to play and this prevents me from having to choose what 'big' game I'll be playing next, ah ah. I spent 200+ hours on Witcher 3 on GOG, so I come to Steam for shorter game sessions, out of habit. I'm giving this one a negative recommendation but a positive review, because if you're like me you tend to read negative reviews mostly and prefer to see well weighed opinions that will focus on the negative issues but still encourage you to try out the game if they don't bother you.  Out of everything I've played these last few weeks (Heroes of Hellen, Bejeweled, Montezuma, Luxor and a couple others), this is on par with Hellen in terms of complexity (although not as interesting), and much worse when it comes to readability. I think this is very important in a game, and if I fail some boards because some of the rules weren't properly explained, or because the rich graphics hurt your eyes (for instance, good luck trying to determine if that special tile needs brown, red or orange matches!), I tend to be unhappy and give up. The problem is that it gets excruciatingly long to finish a single board after the first few tutorialesque wonders. Indeed, after a while your levels will consist of 5 things you'll have to do and be careful about (1) destroy all tiles behind the gems by having them in a match, (2) destroy metal tiles twice, (3) collect up to 5 different resources from special gems (which will take the most effort to do, and don't even try to forget a single one if you don't want to waste more time!), (4) be careful with the board layout, as it often gets convoluted and forces you to use destructive powers in a few places, and (4) do a specific color match on two specific tiles (later in the game, the 'singled out' power-up will help you with those, but by the time you get it, you probably won't need it anymore.) And finally, (5), after you clear a board's tiles, a special gem drops that you must guide to the bottom of the board to finish it. At that point it's time to make sure you gathered all resources, and then use the Column power-up that will save you a lot of time.  I've just finished the main game after about 10 hours, and I'd estimate the latter half of the game has levels that would take more than 10 minutes to finish without power-ups, and you never have that time if you're playing in normal mode, so you'll have to use power-ups on a regular basis (thankfully, some of them like the slime monster recharge very quickly). I made a break of a few weeks between my first and second session, and totally forgot the game had power-ups, so... just don't, really, or your self-esteem will suffer. Early levels can be completed without them, but the latter half will systematically give you a shorter time than needed, and you'll have to rely on some of them regularly.  I need to mention achievements. Many Steam users enjoy trying to perfect their game, and this one isn't going to be easy. You can easily get two thirds of the achievements by the time you finish the game casually, but some of them are a bit unfair. For instance, there's an achievement you can only get when you finish it in normal mode *and* do not fail a single board. If you do fail one (and it will happen if you don't use power-ups regularly and watch their recharge status), you need to restart the current wonder from the start to ensure you get the achievement. Given that there are a minimum of 7 boards to complete before you can finish building a wonder, it means failing a board might actually force you to spend the next hour or two redoing what you previously completed successfully. This is a game that is best played in Zen mode, I imagine, and let's consider 'Normal' mode to be targeted to hardcore casuals; yes that category exists, that is, regular gamers who haven't come out of the casual closet yet. Ask your aunt what she does at night on the computer, she can give you advice.  There are also a few mini-games, some of which are fun (I like the lab one and the map parts one), but they're tied to achievements that require you to finish them all. Completing levels in 'Diamond Domino Mine' is very luck-based (you depend on a draw of items, and you have a limited number of redraws), and if you make a wrong move, there's no 'undo' button, you have to restart the level from scratch. Since that game itself isn't particularly exciting, after a while you just give up on it and the idea of perfecting your game achievements.  Other aspects of the game are pleasing, but I think the other reviews mention it enough. I would like to mention the spelling, though. I'm not an English native so I'd be the last person to be a grammar Nazi, and yes I'm aware that this was developed in Russia, and yes story is just a pretext, but there are typos here and there, and if they didn't caught by the US producers, then what can I say... Shows some lack of quality control.",

            "review_text": "7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover is a match-three puzzle game, similar to Bejeweled. I've never been a fan of Bejeweled...I've always found the game to be boring, but this game adds a bunch of elements to the formula, and for me, this game succeeds where Bejeweled fails; in providing clear goals as you play. This apparently is the fifth game in the series, but it's the first I've played.  As you play, you have several goals you have to keep in mind. You need to make a match of a certain colour of the colored cells, you may have to get as many resources as possible by making matches with the resources tiles and you have to breakaway the background and make a piece fall to the bottom to complete the level. It was much easier for me to stay engaged with this game as I tried to fulfill every goal on the level.  There's sort of a meta-game where you use the puzzles to build things, but it doesn't do much for me. The story is incredibly stupid, but it's un-intrusive. This is definitely a game build for touch screens, and the keyboard and mouse controls suffer for it. but the only reason you get a game like this is for the puzzles, and I found them fun. The game's tutorial is completely rubbish, unfortunately, and it almost prevented me from playing at all. You must read all the help screens to play.  I'd pick this game up if you see it cheap. There's no shortage of good casual games, and if you enjoy match-three games, I'd recommend this one.",
