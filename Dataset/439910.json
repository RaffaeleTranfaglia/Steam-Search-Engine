            "review_text": "Risky rescue is a good looking game with a simple premise - rescue people in a helicopter which can only fly in four diagonal directions, using two buttons.  There is a 50 level campaign across three 'worlds' and an endless mode. The endless mode is where you keep flying up rescuing people without crashing into static buildings and mountains and moving objects likes rockets, aeroplanes and wind turbines. Oh and make sure you're quick too or the ever encroaching tidal wave will catch up with you.  You earn cash by rescuing people successfully and get to spend it on new helicopters with different handling characteristics; speed, acceleration and deceleration.  It is a perfect game to pick up for 10 minutes on a lunch break, and certainly has that one more go addictive nature.",

            "review_text": "Barely OK, easy, but awkward controls. Takes about an hour to play 50 simple levels. Then you can just try to get 3-stars on each level, and grind to purchase other helicopters (the default one is fine). A few problems: (1) The controls are awkward. You only have right &amp; left which make you go up-right or up-left and it automatically descends in the last direction when not going up &amp; right/left. You might be able to use down to decelerate down-left/right faster, but is unecessary. (2) Your star rating seems based in time, which includes your partner, not how many guys you rescued more than the bot, but you still have to rescue more than the bot to proceed, and if the bot takes a while your rating is hurt. Still, I ended up with 1-3 stars per level on first try, better if the bot crashed because it stops the time immediately if waiting for him. It is partly cooperative, pertly competitive which is odd. (3) I don't see any point to buying other helicopters. It is so wonky as it is that I can't imagine controlling it if it were faster. It was really ackward at first, but rather OK later. I was happy to reach level 50 and be done, but wasn't bad by then.  I was hoping it would be similar to Space Taxi (C64), but it plays nothing like it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but it is tolerable if you really wanted it.",
