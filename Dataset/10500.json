            "review_text": "My first ever dip into the Total War franchise, and what a plunge it turned out to be. I managed to pick it up for £3.75, and seeing the high scores it was achieveing on metacritic on fueled my purchase. And for what it turned out I bought, £3.75 was a steal! The game itself may seem a little daunting at first as you meet the gigstntic map, and play your first RTS battle, but as you begin to gain experience, and attempt to control the world, you pick it up very quickly and easily. The whole turn based strategy map that you control is fantastically done, as you feel almost god-like when peering down at the continents. The AI may not be the smartest, but with a few simple mods, you can almost feel them breathing down your neck everytime you make your move. The Technology tree has to be one of the best I've had the privilege to play around with, as I could instantaneously feel the effects of my chosen advancement.  The RTS is the best I have ever played, with the vastness of iit all taking your breath away. Controlling 100s if not 1000s of troops with just a click of your mouse is always a joy to play, and I have taken many screenshots of my epic moments on the battlefield. Like X-com, you'll forge stories foy ur troops as you valiantly defeat a far superior army, or cumple under an army of only 300. The era is also very interesting with the use of muskets. This adds an interesting dynamic to the battles, and requires quick thinking to ensure your men are set up correctly to take down the opposing line. For this reason, cavalry are of upmost importance and requires that little edge to out maneuver the opponent. Empire: Total War has to be one of my most satuisfactory purchases, and has given me a bottomless well of enjoyment, and I would still be playing it if my life allowed me. Nevertheless I find myslef dipping in now and then often to match up against my brother, after a petty quaral. When a game can hook you, and keep you hooked like it did to me, you know it's something special.",

            "review_text": "Empire: Total War  Positives:  + Research tree which allows you to unlock additional technologies for your nation. These technologies directly affect income, military advancement and building options, fuelling your progress towards modern industrialisation with factories and steam mines.  + Decent graphics. + Massive campaign map to play on, including the Americas, Europe and India which results in a lot of replayability and exploration.  + Good selection of campaign map agents. Rakes honourably duel other rakes, sabotage enemy cities and carry out assassinations. Religious agents like missionaries, brahmin or imams convert the population, and gentlemen can steal enemy research from universities or speed up technology acquisition in your own.  + Real-time tactical battles where you can command up to thousands of soldiers, cannons and cavalry at the same time. Naval battles also feature in this game and they're quite epic! + Realistic diplomacy system.  + Good trading system. The 18th century was centered on lucrative trade operations with other countries and this is reflected in Empire: Total War. Export cotton, tea, cocoa and sugar from your plantations to other nations for gold. + Huge assortment of units at your disposal. With the addition of DLC packs (which aren't expensive) every nation has unique units and each playthrough feels different.  + Multiplayer mode so you can play battles against a friend if they have the game. + Four difficulty levels that will match a player of all skill levels - very hard is a true challenge!  Negatives:  - Battle AI could be more intelligent. One who is skilled at land battles won't find themselves challenged very much. However, in the light of everything Empire: Total War does so well, this problem can be overlooked.   Overall Score: 10/10  Empire: Total War has to be the best Total War game made to date. Released in 2009, it is still highly respected in the turn based RTS genre to this day.",

Shogun II runs badly and has balance issues, whereas Napoleon has few enemies (although those few enemies have large territories.)  You get to perform research in Empire. I do wish the research tree was larger for Battle and Economic areas. It is very large on Philosophy.   The units are nice. All three arms of the military, infantry, cavalry and artillery, are equal in this time period and thus all three types of units have a role on the battlefield. Having a good mix of these works really well.  Generals can be appointed easily and troops can move and attack without generals.  Trading is neat. Diplomacy works well too.  Ship battles are cool.  Anyway, this is a good Total War title. I had no problems getting the game to run in Win 7 64-bit. Good game.",

            "review_text": "It's been a while since my first review of this game, so I felt it would be time to give out a more proper one. It's a good game, but not without several problems.  Empire: Total War, set in the 18th century, is a game I reccomend to the player who likes the idea of massive, 18th century-style land and naval battles. The game also has a very large campaign map, including India, Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. There's also a lot of colonialism involved as well, so if you like all of these things I mentioned, you'll probably like this game.   However, don't expect multiplayer to be a fun experience. It's still active, but there aren't many people playing. There's a good number of players here that will mistakenly or purposefully break the rules set by players hosting their games. Even hosts will break their own rules.   You also need to consider the fact that there are many players on here that have adopted the use of specific units that are simply OP, which therefore ruins the historical atmosphere of this game. Historically, most 18th century infantry were armed with highly innacurate guns, so they gathered in very large formations and fired at each other. They were called line infantry. This type of warfare was in no way meant to prolong the life of an individual soldier at all. The entire point of this type of fighting between infantry units was to use overwhelming force and numbers of troops and firepower to overcome the other side, which meant that line infantry would have to have some serious discipline and toughness. You'd rarely ever take cover, and if you were in the front lines, your slim chances of surviving the battle depended on how fast you could reload your gun and if you could make your shot count before the other side did the same thing you were meant to do.   Now, you'd think line infantry would be the staple unit on this game, and therefore they'd be pretty effective. However, their historical use as the essential staple unit for 18th century armies can easily be rendered useless on this game with just three types of units: Riflemen, skirmishers, and light dragoons.   The sad fact is that on multiplayer, the only three types of effective ground units that have any form of effectiveness on this game are the three units I stated above, aside from artillery. True, line infantry still have their uses, but not by much You see, the problem here is that skirmishers and riflemen have guns that can shoot farther than the muskets used by your line infantry, and they are unfairly accurate, meaning that your line infantry will be dropping like flies just trying to close the distance to take on the skirmishers and riflemen. They also reload their weapons incredibly fast. This is in no way historically accurate, because the guns used by lighter infantry forces at the time, no matter how far they shot, were still incredibly accurate and would have taken a long time to reload. Not only that, but we're talking about guns that weren't easy to aim with.   I could understand how lightly armed riflemen and skirmishers could give line infantry some serious trouble in, say, a bunch of forests, but they are so overpowered on this game that they can easily take out line infantry on an open battlefield.   Then there are light dragoons...  Light dragoons are soldiers riding on horseback, equipped with modified muskets that have shorter barrels. Therefore, they'd be less accurate, right? In real life, yes, but in this game? Wrong. Would it be easy reloading these guns on horseback? No, because muskets need to have the projectiles loaded with ram rods, primed, blah blah blah, shoot, repeat. It's difficult enough to do all of this while standing on your own two feet, but on horseback? That's bound to take longer.   Light dragoons can be incredibly dangerous to line infantry due to their superior speed, and because this game has overpowered them, every single soldier in a unit of light dragoons fires his gun, even the ones in the back. None of the troops in the front ranks of the dragoons die, and for some strange reason, a good number of the shots fired hit their mark. Sometimes, This means that you'll be having large numbers of line infantry dying all at once, which can cause a morale shock.   So unless you make rules against the use of light dragoons and skirmishers on the games you host in multiplayer, you'll be seeing these units being used on a constant basis, throwing all of the great historical accuracies of 18th century warfare out the window.  Now that's been explained, I should tell you about a few problems with other aspects of this game:  1) Despite the fact that Empire has a very large campaign map, you will be disappointed to find that almost every single battle map looks the same. Same texture, same everything. Yes, some buildings will look different depending on what part of the world you're in on the campaign, but you will quickly realise how bland the atmosphere of the maps are when you fight battles. Building detail in towns is also severly lacking.  2) The AI is incredibly dumb at times, so dumb that the developers decided to buff up the stats of the AI's units to compensate for their stupidity in the higher difficulty levels.   3) Individual troops in your army lack spatial awareness when they enter buildings or defend/attack fort walls in a siege battle. It's a horrid sight to see at times. Troops just move through each other in a frantic motion. Path finding on walls is also terrible.  4) Some sound effects for this game are awful, especially for muskets. For example, when a unit of line infantry fire a volley at the enemy, you only hear a 'poof' sound. These are primitive gunpowder weapons. They should be noisy and make a loud 'bang' when fired. Instead, the muskets used by your line infantry sound like fake guns used for movies in Hollywood.  5) You won't hear any general's speech before battle like you used to in Rome I and Medieval II.   6) There isn't much voice acting. You won't get to hear any voice acting at all when you initiate diplomacy, and the few bits of voice acting that you do here on this game tends to be subpar.  7) Melee combat between infantry units looks decent, but not amazing. The combat animations are too drawn out and look more rehearsed than realistic. Some of the combat animations are so terrible drawn out that everything looks unrealistic.  8) Because of the way the death animations work on this game, cavalry takes forever to take out a routing unit. Many times, an unnecessarily long combat animation has to be so terribly drawn out that it takes longer than needed for the cavalry to take out the routers. It'd be more convenient if the cavalry just swing their swords at boom, the routing units die faster.  9) Artillery units can be glitchy, even in multiplayer. Sometimes, they won't fire their guns no matter how many times you order them to.  10) On the campaign map, the AI controlling Britain, the United Provinces, and France tend to ignore India for some reason, so almost every single time you play this campaign, the Marathas end up becoming an OP faction.  11) There are no marching tunes with fifes and drums on the battlefield for any of the factions. This feature should have been implemented by the developers. I can understand that some players might find them distracting, but an option could be made to just turn off those marching tunes in the game.   12) Naval battles can sometimes be a little glitchy. Ships will sometimes move unnecessarily slow even when you order them to move faster.  This game can still be enjoyed despite all of these problems I mentioned. However, it will never be as great as it could have been. There are, however, a few mods for this game that you can use to make this game more enjoyable. Keep in mind that the mods are, unfortunately, not supported for Steam as there is no workshop.",

Maybe that was about a fresh setting, diverse landscapes, revamped city-building, comfortable pacing, huge world to fight for or the first buggy steps into co-op multiplayer, but as a matter of fact it has a sweet nostalgic aftertaste Napoleon or Shogun 2 didn't leave for me.

For those die-hard fans who enjoyed the micro-management of old and variety of options when creating and managing cities, you may find this game frustrating, especially with how pivotal a role religion plays in this title (realistically in my opinion).

            "review_text": "Empire: Total War is a rather fun combination of real-time tactics and turn-based strategy. Overall the Fifth game of the Total War series, this was the first Total War game I have played, and I enjoyed it a great deal. I started off with the tutorial, which covers both ground unit real-time tactics, and naval warfare. Following this fast-paced, easy to use tutorial, I began playing from the Settlement of Jamestown. The learning curve was very easy with this game, and it was surprisingly fun for a turn-based game. Normally, I don't find these types of games enjoyable, but there was something about Empire: Total War that had me wanting to keep playing.   Historical challenges are available, including several notable historic battles, The Battle of Brandywine Creek, Fontenoy, and so on. Conquest is the ultimate objective of the game and this can be done using not only military units, but Exploration, Trade, Politics, and founding other colonies. You have the option of playing almost a dozen different main factions. Campaigns allow you to play through American colonisation such as Establishing the colony of Jamestown, to the French and Indian conflict, and even the War for American Independence.   I really enjoyed the historical aspect of this game, and also how it is part turn-based and part real-time strategy. I think Empire: Total War does a good job of weaving the two separate game styles together into a seamless whole. I think based off my enjoyment of this game, I may enjoy some of the other Total War titles as well.",

Thanks to that you can spend many hours on this game without getting bored.   The diplomacy features in this game are quite good, but they could be better. Religion is a great factor and the historical alliances are not easily broken, while in reality the nations switched alliances almost every generation.

You can create a larger economy, and thus a bigger army to expand your operations.  You are able to partake in diplomatic relations to create trade deals and allies. Alternatively, you can use this feature to bribe your way out of 'sticky' situations, or you can even use it to declare war on another faction.  I would give this game a 7 and a half out of 10.

Like the other Total War games it has a mix of a turn based campaign map where you build up your Cities, Towns, Infrastructure and strategicaly move your troops. Real-Time battles from Open Fields and Seiging Forts to Sea Battles with fleets of heavy first rate ships of the line.  Still the game has issues but they can be looked past, because who doesn't love conquering enemy nations with several 'stacks of doom'.  Pros : Game looks great on high graphics settings. Sound is Great. Great Ship battles with a veriety of ships. 3 different Continents to conquer - Americas, Europe and India. Large open fields to fight on with large army's. Historical Battles. Able to save presets for troop selection (Multiplayer and custom battles). Different victory conditions. Multiplayer, though you don't really see any games on it any more (luckily all the achievments are soloable against the AI).  Cons :  Diplomacy needed alot more work, AI can be completely stupid when it comes to the negotiations asking for rediculas things. AI on open field battle needed a bit more work, but its not really noticable here when your having fun slaughtering them all lol. The battle results - Heroic victory etc displays wrong. Poorly Optimized for AMD Graphics cards because its sponsored by Nvidia. Kill 1 million enemies Achievment... ugh this is 1 boring grind, 400+ hours and I haven't hit 200k kills yet.  My advice is to wait for when it's on sale but it's still too good of a game to wait for that :P",

The gameplay is great - the world is gigantic, there is a new building system that makes building multiple structures simultaneously possible, there is a technology and philosophy research area, there are gentleman, naval battles where you can actually control your ships (I don't enjoy these much, though they look nice), there is North America and some of South America, and India (which we only got a glimpse of in Alexander!) There are many playable factions, and you can even unlock the American Indian factions by purchasing the Warpath DLC (this, again, requires a drastic change in strategy from the main ETW game, so buyer beware; it's probably also the only DLC worth buying, and only for a few bucks). Oh, and there's also the good ole US of A, which can be played in a campaign tracing the nation's development from a few settlers in Jamestown to an independent but vulnerable republic at the turn of the century.  A few cons: the game is a bit glitchy, battles usually take place in boring forts that all look the same instead of cities, cannon have limitless ammo (could be a pro), game can get slow with the sheer number of factions at the end of every turn. The game came out very unfinished, but it's been polished up and is now defnitely worth buying for any TW fan.",

            "review_text": "Total War's first foray into an age other than one of swords and bows, Empire, like much of this franchise, is a flawed gem. Being their first real go with armies that predominatly use guns, the AI work is sloppy and it really shows. It's pathetic how easy it is to expoit the AI's failings in battle and win yourself crushing victories that you shouldn't have gotten. It's also the first shot at naval combat, which functionally works better but still seems to generate complaints. Personally I blame that on a lack of knowledge about how to use warships in the age of sail in a fight more than anything else (hint: cut the enemy's battle line). Lastly, the diplomatic AI has a rather predictable habit of delivering you unpredictable war declarations. For example I was minding my own business as the French carving up North America for myself when I got war declared on me by the Marathas (India). Before too long they were landing armies in the Carribean and harassing my trade fleets. Why? I still have no idea, but it sure didn't help them when I dropped my huge armies fresh from American conquest into India. But damn was that war annoying when it started.  So what's the good? The map is -huge-, and the number of choices for nations to play is considerable (Though most are European). In other words... replay value is in abundance here. And that's really all it needs, to be honest. A game like this is made for being replayed and ending up in various differing situations. And it is here that this game shines. Otherwise it's a mixed bag.  What i'm trying to say is that this game is pretty decent, but you might not want this to be the first game in the series you try. It might sour your opinion and lead you to not looking into the other, arguably better or at least less flawed, entries into the series. But, this does have huge replay value. You will get alot of playtime out of this. If that's what you are looking for, then that might be all you need to have the pros of this game outweigh its problems.",

Placate your population with religion, sorted diversions or military presence or victories. Utilize the same to dominate a conquered populace and/or turn them in time to your loyal followers. Infiltrate opposing countries with spies, assasinate or sabatoge as you go. Send out religious emisaries to turn populations to the one true religion. Train researchers to bolster your war technology or steal/trade it from another country.   The Grand Campaign is amongst the best offered in any strategy game and was probably the best at the time the game was released. So many factions to conquer.

But IMO, with the correct Mods (i.e. Darthmod) this game is the largest in scope and really gives you the sense of controlling a world wide empire.   What makes this game so enjoyable for me is the incredible amount of variance in play throughs. Your campaign as Great Britain or The United Provinces, which sees a lot of overseas expansion, is likely going to be very different than a campaign as Austria or one of the Indian factions, which are much more land locked. Of course, you can always mix it up and change history by taking over Europe as the Ottoman Empire, then invade and conquer the Americas.   The actual battles are great as well, and again with the right mods they can actually be a challenge. t is very fun to assault an enemy position or to use the terrain to make a strong defensive position and repel enemy attacks. I think the graphics and animations during battles are superb, even if more recent titles like Shogun 2 have improvements.   As I mentioned this is my favorite Total War game, and will likely remain so as Rome 2 is a mess and I just can't bring myself to play it.",

In fact I've done about 40 offline and get this game fairly well.   Empire: Total War is much like it's previous games, start with a small empire, conquer land and build a mighty empire. Now I put it out there that Empire does have it's flaws, I am unable to play it now thanks to my current graphics card and ATi Catalyst Control Centre (beware ATi card owners), however I enjoyed this greatly. It builds upon what was last seen in Medieval 2 removing but mainly adding many great features such as sea warfare. The graphics are also greatly improved and suprisingly need a pretty decent PC compared to it's time (hint 2011 gaming PC) to run at maximum graphics which is fine.   The grand campaign oh how's it's improved for the better. You now can manage your government, research new tech and ultimately do quite a bit more with what is done in your empire. However some things have been dumbed down a little. Cities have less buildings and are a bit less interesting when it comes to benefits of having them. Other aspects have improved though over predeccesors.   The battles, what Total War is also renowned for has improved, adding sea battles which are mind blowing how detailed they are. Empire has done well with the land battles too, adding cover systems, buildings to hide your troops in and many great details that improve ways that battles are fought.   Now on a less positive note, as noted before, this is glitchy, has problems with ATi cards and can have random stutters and crashes. Nevertheless these are completely random and could just be for random PC's. However beware and be prepared for such issues. This is graphically a masterpiece and ultimately a game that will always provide enjoyments for hours to come.  Pros - Revamps battles and add sea battles. - Upgraded the campaign with new features. - Incredible graphics. Cons - Bugs and Glitches, random crashes. - ATi card issues.  8/10 Gracious considering my issues with my graphics card otherwise would rate 9/10.",

First time for me when CA seriously dropped the ball, but the more I play it the more I realize I should have had a refund.  Positives The game looks good when zoomed in. New game mechanics in advanced trade, multi warzones around the globe. Sea combat. New nations.  Negatives Feel: Maybe it is the period, but all European nations feel totally the same. Other than that nations have specific end buildings in capitals which helps with the immersion. Fights: 0/10 to AI quality. Pathfinding is abismal. You attack a unit infront of you, and your guys start running away (not retreating, or fleeing, running away from their goal.) Worse is, if you click right behind the enemy, they run towards the point without an issue. (Something is wrong with the attack script and it mainly happens in fort defense or attack.) Units CANNOT use walls. This was done in medieval, but here CA failed to do what they already had in the past. 1 guy is out of position running back and forth in the same place, so the entire unit just stands about without firing a single shot. And units CANNOT find a route off-on a wall. 1 bloke is stuck on the wall? Well the entire unit runs back to him, even if they almost reached their target already. Gates are used in a 1 man line for some reason they are as if they were a tight rope.  Your cannons play a very important role. BUT you MUST switch off auto aim. The canon crews execute themselves firing sideways, through the cannon next to them within the same crew, just to be scared of their own mental backwardness and flee in terror. They will also happily execute anyone on their side without further consideration.  If you want to put down money for such a game buy medieval or 'buy it off a friend' and fund modders who may fix this cluster mess. On that point, it is also harder to mod this game than Medieval, so you will find fewer overhauls and fixes.  Whioever scored this game higher... I do not know what you see in it, compared ot working games. If I put Medieval2 at 8/10 this cannot be above 5. It is bling and nicer, but years have passed, it MUST be nicer. If this was released by anyone else it would be a total flop without a single mention in any gaming press.",

The naval battles are moderatly entertaining but the same thing, cannons take rediclous amounts of time to reload, just like land battles.  I enjoyed the campaign a lot but the battles were certainly not for me considering I like historical accuracy and men who dont masturbate with their weapons during battle!  The American campaigns of indipendence are frusturating to say the least, you need to get TONS of land to win your freedom, some of it in Canada that we never even went to during the Revolution, let alone capture. So you are spread rediclously thin against the might of the British Empire and they expect you to capture what seems like 80-90 percent of North America to win the game.  The only units that functioned even a little bit realisticly was the cavalry but building and reserching is rediculously slow and expensive so getting good cavalry early on is difficult. Oh and when pikemen charge they do it with swords, not their pikes.  I only recommend this game if you enjoy the campaign games of previous total war games rather than the battles, just get it on sale and don't buy any dlc.",

            "review_text": "I like this game, but I would not recommend it.  The game for the most part takes place during the mid 1700s to early 1800s, when muskets were weapon of choice for armies, when the golden age of sail was reaching its peak, and European nations had vast colonial empires that stretched across the globe. You control a major nation during this time and it's your job to lead it to glory, generally by crushing anyone who tries to pick a fight with you. The world is yours to conquer, and it is a very large world indeed.  And yet despite how awesome that sounds, this is not a good game. For a tactics game, the AI strategy for most games kind of sucks. Rather than take advantage of terrain like they did in previous Total War games, the AI will almost always charge you head on. And on my computer whenever there was a large battles the game would tend to chug like anrexic train going uphill. If you have a modern gaming rig, you *might* not have the same trouble I did but even then I wouldn't bet on it.  And the combat map designs are kind of lazy. It doesn't matter what part of the globe you're fighting on, because chances are you'll be fighting on the same square of 1700th century farm land with MAYBE a palette swap of the ground textures. This is real shame because in previous Total War games they had meticulous detailed combat maps.  However the one saving grace of this game is its naval combat. The ships in this game are gorgeous, with meticulous detail put into every ship model. And there are a lot of ships, from bomb ketches, to the first rates, and even steam ships later in the game. Naval combat revolves primariy around using the wind to your advantage and either destroying enemy ships with regular cannon balls or crippling so you can board and capture them. Here seems to be where all the brains for the AI went, because it will actually use tactics.   However even the naval combat will not be for everyone. For one thing it requires and intense ammount of micro managing. Every single ship will need to be repositioned at some point. And in order to use some the abilities that will turn the tide, you need to take control of each ship one at a time to activate them. Personally I liked the challenge, but I've heard from others that they found it to be a pain in the ♥♥♥.  So for me personally, I have a love hate relationship with this game (in that I hate that I love it) but I would recommend virtually any other Total War game over this one.",

It constantly keeps crashing for no reason, the campaign map is laggy as hell (even though my machine more than surpasses the minimum requirements for this crappy game).  The gameplay itself is quite nice, but there are better Total War games out there (Rome 1 and Shogun 2) which have much more polish and which actually come off as being a finished product.  Recently Creative Assembly have taken a lot of flak from some of their old-school fans (for good reasons) and their lack of support for any of their older releases (more strikingly this one) is one of the main stains on their reputation as a company.   I love Total War. Like most fans, I got introduced through Rome 1 (which I still play to this day) so having to go through the amount of frustration I went through just to get this game to work on my machine makes me never want to buy another title from CA again. But I'll still continue to play Shogun 2 and Rome 1 (also Medieval 2) as they represent the best that this particular series has to offer.  tl;dr - pass on this, buy Shodun 2 or Rome 1 if you're looking for a complete Total War experience.",

Watching people rush in a slow pace to club someone with a rifle just isn't as appealing to watching a guy get smashed to the ground by a giant axe in Medieval 2. The music is boring too, wasn't this the age of Beethoven or Bach? Their music was epic but noooo had to be quiet dull music instead.  Only thing I recommend from this game is the addiction and desire to conquer the whole world, although even then I'd hesitate. How can France be one province? That's just stupid.

I disagree with these claims.  A)  Well, compared to Medieval II total war the gameplay is slightly worse but on my opinion on Empire total war is for example slightly better than usually praised Shogun 2 Totalwar. This is because Empire Total war has much larger playable campaing map (This apllies also when Empire is compared to Napoleon Total War), much better naval battles and much more unit diversity.  The main downside of Empire Total war is that unlike Shogun Total war it doesn't have campaign map multiplayer (though I hear there are possibly some mods that make it more or less possible).   If we forget these differences, the main difference between Shogun 2 Total War and empire Total War is just the setting.  B)  I believe that the reason why people think that Empire Total War is filled with bugs, is that from what I have heard, that really was the case when the game was released. I on the other hand didn't buy Empire Total War at the release date and nor have I seen almost any bugs. So at least I suppose that the game was buggy at launch, but It is NOT buggy anymore due to patches. (Of course it si still possible that i have just been really lucky.)",

For those of you looking for a great total war video on its many problems I recommend Dr. Reynold Sanity on youtube. If you can stand Australian cynical and somewhat offensive humor he makes a lot of great points. Nails it on the head.  For the price I would pick the game up but just watch your calavary chase after a routed unit and yea..... Watch as the entire unit chases one man while the others run in the opossite direction and then just sit around. Even after uncountable patches this game is still rather messy. The AI while no longer creating armies of 7 cannons and a single skirmisher (not all the time) is a bit better, they are still pretty bad even by total war standards. On the plus side they will form large fleets and armies. Id ignore the campain all together. It culminates in fighting a British army who only buys native horse musketmen who are the best guys you want to gaurd a fort and man the wall.   Random agent spawning is frustrating as well. Still if you like the time period get it or napoleon. Stay away from Rome 2. While many praise shogun 2 for its polish it is still hurt by the warscape engines lack of collision detection and only allowing 1vs1 melee. Enjoy watching your men circle a single unit and get cut down one at a time.   For the last great melee total war you want medievil 2. Although Shogun is pretty solid. They just need to really overhaul or just go back to the old engine with better looking models.  Still have to recommend.",

Best TW ever IMO. some things in Napoleon as I said were improved, graphics especially when it came to battles and cannon impacts etc. But also in the fact you could rebuild buildings instead of haveing to tear something else down and then build, their general recruitment and injury/recovery system was better IMO, the thing that saddened me was that the campaign map had shrunk although the world was technically even bigger than during the ETW time period of 1700-1799, by the 1805-1815's as in Napoleon TW, Most of Africa was colonized, most of South America was colonized AND the great western railway was only 17 years from its beginning of construction, ALL of North America would have been part of the game if it stood to me, Furthermore by the 1790's the British Empire had put alot of effort into the Chinese empire, which by then also should have been part of the game but wasn't.  Imo instead of a crummy little game like their newest game Total War: Atilla they should have made an Empire TW 2: The Global Empire, including everything from 1700 to 1850, including the 1770 discovery of 'Terra Australis' or well rediscovery as it ofcourse was :D IMO, they claim to be soo historically correct, but they are only up to the point that they can make their deadlines.",

            "review_text": "Review for Empire Total War  Empire Total War is a epic Grand Strategy game that features Real Time battles. Empire Total War in it’s release state was a disgrace to the Total War franchise. But since launch, Empire has improved to a very playable and fun game.   The game is based in the 18th century with the game starting in 1700 and ending in 1800. The game’s main focus is on the Real Time battles but it features more Grand Strategy than previous Total War games.   The Real Time battles are a joy to watch and play. But there are some problems with the battles, the most glaring is the AIs lack of strategic ability. I have had the AI knock down their own walls with cannons during siege battles.   The Grand Strategy part of the game is deeper in my opinion than any previous Total War game. In the Grand Strategy mode you can control your nation by doing various things like upgrading minor and major towns or hiring new ministers.   The diplomacy can be extremely annoying with the AI not giving you the technological equivalent of the wheel for a ballistic missile sometimes.   To fix most of these problems you can download the Darthmod mod. Darthmod’s main improvement is the AI. with darthmod even on medium difficulty the AI can be brutally efficient. Darthmod also increases the troop count to make bigger battles. Darthmod also adds smaller graphical improvements like musket and cannon smoke not dissipating for a long time.   Summary: This is a very fun Grand Strategy/Real Time Strategy hybrid that will deliver countless hours of enjoyment. It is worth every penny of $19.99, but if you aren’t sure about it you can download a free demo that showcases the battles.   ",

I develop trade relations with France, England, and several others. I tax my capital heavily in order to spark a revolution to change my government, okay, so now three turns later, nearly all my resources have been developed, and a revolution has sparked up. I side with the rebels, and sweep through my capital pretty easily. The new Mexico is a republic, but no one seems to mind. I now spend all my funds on the military, building up a powerful navy and strong land force. Alright, expansion into central America and the carribbean is needed, so I declare war on spain after allying myself with England. None of my allies come to help, so it's a 1v1 with spain. I quickly board my men on my ships, and invade Cuba, sweep through, and then use my navy to knock out spain's current fleet in the Atlantic. With Spain's navy down, I can transport troops in and out as I please, and soon enough I have taken a majority of the carribbean and even Florida. Now I focus on Central America. I land a full stack of troops after waiting for 2-3 turns near Gualtmela (I can't spell it.) Where I face an army the same size as mine. My general's level is higher, and my men are experienced...I take the risk and auto-resolve it, and I win a heroic victory with only three hundred down. I invade the region capital, and suprisingly, without my garrison the populace stays content. No spainards are around, so I leave the region and invade Panama, occupying it. ALright, Spain has been booted out of the Americas...they've angered GB and are at war with them...but little did I realize the united provinces somehow JOINED Spain in their war against me, and blockaded my trade routes, cutting off my income from the Maratha Confederacy. Soon enough, they've landed a force in Cuba and blockaded my ports their with a full stack of ships...  ---------------------------------------------------------------  The game is nice and has excellent mods, but the vanilla is still good. I love just watching my men get in position as Native Americans charge at me with their axes charging while my musketmen just fire off one volley and it's like: 'Newbs, get rekt' and the natives retreat after their lines are decimated.  The only flaw is not being able to suicide ram with ships.",

Empire was the first Total War game I played and it has had me addicted to strategy ever since. The period in which it is set I find very interesting and the wide range of units you can use in combat (late game) makes the battles more interesting. However, the battles feel very slow and the AI could be better.  The diplomacy system is probably my least favourite part of the game as the AI are not very flexible and it is very difficult to get a deal out of them, nothing peturbing them unless you stand outside their last region with an army Napoleon himself would have been proud of.   My favourite part of the game is the campaign map itself, spanning Europe and North Africa, the Middle East, India and the Americas (or at least most of it). I would have liked the game to incorporate more of the map as regions to be controlled rather than have the rest of the known world as trade theatres.   It is very enjoyable to play the game with most of the available nations, however, access to minor nations does not come with the vanilla game so I would get an all factions mod to enhance your experience. The Warpath Campaign is also a fun DLC worth the buy.   For someone who is looking to get into strategy games, this is a good starting point. If you are looking for something with better battles I prefer the older Total War games of Rome and Medieval 2. If you are looking for a game which solely focuses on campaign strategy I would recommend a Paradox game, i.e Europa Universalis. Even if you do get one of the other games, this is still a great addition to have.  9/10 for enjoyment",

However even, on lower settings, the game still looks pretty good. Sounds are authentic as well with muskets and cannons. In terms of gameplay, there is everything a Total War game should have and   more  . The campaign mode is defintely pretty awesome where you pick a faction and play for world domination. In the Road to Independance Campaign, you play as the United States in the events that lead to the declaration of independance. There is also a skirmish mode where you can choose a map/scenario and choose your units and battle it out. Multiplayer is also present for those who want a human challenge.

To play Devil's advocate, the naval combat is excellent, land battles are believable and enjoyable, research and population are managed better than previous titles and the overall feel is less clunky than its predecessors.   The AI remains a schizophrenic insane diplomat in the strategic map, and goes from Napoleon's protege to lobotomised monkey depending on the alignment of the planets, and often carelessly runs its cavalry into stakes or gun lines.  Definitely worth a look, but it disappoints mostly in the prospect of what it could have been with less interference from SEGA.",

Battle rules are a little different than other total war games, mostly due to firearms usage.  Empire has different way to use regions. Beside the capital city there are towns which develop over time and can be used to increase happiness in region, income, convert to different religion, or build research facility. Those towns can be raided and damaged.  Cons: Very limited usefullnes of agents. there are 3 types of agents and each has 1 or 2 actions which you might find usefull. It could have been more developed. Diplomacy options are very limited from my point of view, and I have not noticed any specific value in terms of victory conditions (allies, portectorate). Battle placements. Chosing a place of the battle on campaign map has little value as the area is poorly reflected on battle map. I think it is a breat loss. Additional battle fortifications are rarely ever available and sometimes have weird consequences eg. artilery after fortifying cannot be moved and even change of angle is very limited. It certainly does not look like it should. I have also missed Total war encyclopedia which would be very useful.  Overall I think the time period the game is set in is quite interesting and game is fun. Some things can be changed and improved by mods, which are missing on steam but do not doubt those are available.",

Yes there is problems with the game (What total war doesn't?) The Naval Combat isn't the best, AI combat or diplomacy is an issue or acts dumb or wired. But I've had far more better experience playing, fighting, expanding, and a bit of roleplay in my mind. If your planning on getting this, or hesitant on buying it. Trust me, you'll have a blast playing this, especially with mods makes this even more better and additive. If your planning on getting this or Napoleon, get Empire first, more nation's, more areas to conquer, and much more units to choose out of. Sure the alot of units are the same and fight the same except a decent handful depending on the nation you play as. But you'll end up playing so much and lose track of time as you March an army of 3000 vs an army of 4000 and watch as your men and enemy slaughter each other in a tense or losing battle making think on which tactic fits you best and watch as your favorite Line Infantry, and renaming it too, and watch them either cut down the toughest of battles, or watch them rout and being cut down. You'll have fun, I'll guarantee it! And the mods for this is just perfect if you're looking to expand on the experince.",

The controls are like the rest of the series (supurb) aswell as the graphics and character animations. The campaigns are fun and ingaging, aswell as really making your mind think like those great generals back in their time period. I've played more than a 125 hours and loved every minute of it. But of course the big thing about this game is the sea battles, the first of their kind. Well I must say i have never seen such good water effect graphics in my life, not to mention the ships being so heavily detailed alowing you to see everyone of your crew working at your command. The only flaw with this game in my belief is the increased time and low improvments of researching. It killed me seeying all my line infantry only firing with the 1st line while the other 2 just waited. It took ages to finnaly reserch to line firing, and by that time I had almost completed the game.

So there's a bunch of fun stuff to work with in the strategic portion of the game.  Where the game gets really cool is the tactical engine that is used to resolve miltary engagements once they occur; instead of abstractly resolving the batte by a few obscure calculations ala Civilization, you assume tactical control over the army that you have recruited, built, upkept, and have now sent to the front. You go from moving pawns on a map, to a 3D battlefield environment where your (and the enemy's) forces are portrayed in 1:1 scale, and fight in real-time under your command. This feature adds immeasureably to the overall gameplay, as now you'll feel more invested and accountable to your units in Strategy mode, and the tactical combat is made more tense and exciting when your performance in battle will directly effect your results in the strategy portion.  This is a great game for people of all ages. Kids will love it for many of the same reasons they loved Civ, and the Battle Engine is definitely impressive (did I mention you can fight land, as well as sea battles?) Adults and even older folks can enjoy it for the prudent strategy and cunning political mind it takes to manage a major nation in the 1700's, and the well-executed and complementary tactical gameplay. A must-have if you're a history or poli-sci buff who enjoys gaming.",

Sea battles are a nice addition and are actually quite difficult.  Improved over previous Total War games, but I really can't recommend this game. There's just too much grind. If you've played past TW games then the land battles stop being a challenge pretty quickly. Other than that, the only novelty is the new setting.  I'd recommend it if you've never played a Total War game before, but honestly I'd recommend the original Rome: Total War over this.

The campaign map is expansive, the playable factions are unique in their own ways and lend themselves to different strategies, and there's plenty of replay value. I have a couple of gripes with this game, some of which do affect gameplay. Firstly, the enemy AI can be quite dumb at times, even on higher difficulty settings, so the DarthMod add-on is absolutely necessary if you want to play a more challenging campaign. Secondly, the battle map designs are a little too bland for my tastes. I absolutely loved the beautiful and varied map designs in Medieval 2, so Empire felt a little bit like a step back for me in this regard. Lastly, the Road to Independence, a special four-part tutorial campaign, felt pretty stale and overly-scripted until I reached the fourth part, which actually allows you to experience the Grand Campaign in all its glory as the newly-formed United States. Despite these flaws, I generally enjoyed this Total War installment and would recommend it to any strategy gamer. Be sure to patch your game and install DarthMod for the best gameplay experience.",

Improves: ETW had a coop multiplayer in beta mode, but it fell short when they did not stick with allowing players to battle against the computer (every battle was pvp); this was the biggest downside overall. Also, sometimes the CPU will make extremely stupid tactical and strategic decisions during the game (i.e. a very weak country will declare war on your powerful one, or have their general literally walk up to your front line during a battle to get shot to pieces).  Beyond the small improves, if you're into the colonial era, I highly recommend this game.",

Players with designs for a European empire will be better served by the more detailed map of Europe of Napoleon however.  Like most TW games this only truly shines with mods, Darthmod makes for a good 'vanilla+' mod and would bea good start. I'd recommend Imperial Splendour for a more extensive going-over, with the added benefit of not having to strip the Star Wars rubbish that the creator of Darthmod inserts into the game menus and interface in increasingly obnoxious ways from game to game. Still, it makes sense to play a more vanilla experience to gain experience with the game and to csee the work that the Imperial Splendour team have done.",

As an American, when I saw that I almost lost myself in a patriotic rage, and felt a responsibility to inform the gamers who may view that nonsense of the following: Clearly whoever wrote that into the unit description doesn’t understand the historical context behind the 2nd amendment, nor what a militia is, so I will provide the viewers here with some quotes from our founders. Note, the second amendment states the following: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed”.   'I ask, Sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people. To disarm the people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them.' -George Mason-  'A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves …' -Richard Henry Lee-  'And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms; …' Samuel Adams  Other than that, I had some fun playing the game but I quickly got board of the repetitive battles like all other total war games, plus the map mode was buggy as all hell and had horrible framerate problems. All in all would I recommend this? I guess so....",

If you like the age of muskets, colonisation, revolution and enjoy large scale battles with 1000's of troops on screen this might be for you.  You can be as tactical as you like, fielding small but experienced professional armies, using terrain and defensive formations to your advantage.   Alternatively you can send out massed armies of militia and native troops to over whelm your enemy with sheer numbers and fire power. It's up to you.  Don't neglect the home front or you might find yourself putting down rebellious peasants whilst trying to fight a major power.",

Although the game has been around for a long time I found it an asborbing experience to play and worth the large amount of time required to successfully complete the long campaign. Having said that there are issues that detract from the game and these probably apply to the total war series in general. Issues that have been mentioned in other reviews include the inappropriate use of bomb ketches and rocket ships in naval battles. Either they should not have been included in the game or the ability to have coastal battles and sieges in which these ships could have been used should have been developed. Puckle guns are another unit mentioned before that were not actually used in the era and therefore should probably not have been included. Going back to the idea of coastal sieges Marine units might have been an interesting addition to the game and created a bit more diversity in the battle environments.  The battle experience could have been improved by having some sort of smart setup option. I often found I laid out my armies and fleets in the same way, dependent upon the landscape. The ability of the game to remember a preferred setup style and to vary it depending on the terriain could help save a lot of repetitive setup issues. When it came to deciding battles against missmatched armies and fleets using the auto resolve often your troops ended up taking relatively heavy losses. When your fleet came up a mismatched fleet often weaker fleet would be entirely destroyed when it should probably have just been captured. It might have been good to have options on the auto-resolve to indicate tactics that your fleet or army could utilise that would lead to a lower loss of life or the capture of enemy vessels. This would cut down on the 'grind' of some of the battles.  The final issue that I felt could have been better was the 'end'. Just a fairly lame animation and that's that. What I think alot of players of the Total War series would find really interesting would be a 'history' of their campaign sort of like at the end of a Civilisation game. There could be a quick history that showed general information about your game play and other nations and a really detailed turn by turn game history that showed everything from the movement of individual units to general economic and social issues of each faction. Notable battles could highlighted and replayed and pivotal movements could be highlighted. This would be a rewarding experience for a player who has devoted a considerable length of time to playing. It could also be used as feedback for the game developers to find out how the game is played and how it could be improved. These 'histories' could even be shared and 'ranked' between players to create interest for different players to develop their tactics and strategies. Perhaps, there could also be a comparison with the actual events of the era.",

I lost for some reason. I don't want to wait an insanely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of time waiting for the british to route out of the map. Seriously. The AI in seige is STUPID. It camps on the walls when clearly the walls are going to collapse and they die with the wall. The AI on land, flanks his entire ♥♥♥♥ing army around your army, so your having to go sideways and he still is trying to flank you. I get small flanks and retreats but flanking your entire army?!! Also, the mentally challenged AI will put is army in front of the charge and if you fire your artillery he will retreat and go back repeating the process. So, I killed 2 guys, retreat, comes back, kills another 2 guys, WTF? I'm very lucky I got this game when it was 3.00. SERIOUSLY LOWER THE PRICE AND STOP GIVING US ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAMES TOO EARLY.
