            "review_text": "Although it didn't involve any interaction like its predecessor, it was still enjoyable and was able to be finished a lot more quickly than its predecessor.  The story is told through chapters with there being 12 in total, 7 of them the main story and 5 of them being side chapters.  Some points in the story were a bit boring, but overall it was a good game.   Now moving on to the important question;  Can I recommend this?  Yes and no;  What I mean is, while yes I can recommend this to some people, there are others who would not wish to try this game as they don't consider it as a 'real game', its more of a visual novel but that doesn't mean its a bad thing.  As I said above, it was enjoyable, and if you have nothing to do on a day that might be rainy or boring, then sitting down and playing this through would be a good way to pass the time.  So if you like visual novels, then give this a try you might enjoy it, if you don't enjoy visual novels well then this probably isn't for you, but who knows if you do decide to try and give visual novels a fair chance you may like them, although I wouldn't recommend this to be your first visual novel :P  But to sum everything up;  Cherry Tree High I! My! Girls! a silly yet enjoyable kinetic visual novel that picks up where Cherry Tree High Comedy Club left off. 8/10",

            "review_text": "Short but sweet.  If you are expecting something substantial you will be disappointed. The game can easily be finished in just a few hours.  Neither would I call this really a sequel to CTHCC. It is at best a short addendum or spinoff of the first game. There isn't much in the way of story, it is more a nice way to revisit the characters you know and love and spend a little more time with them.  The game is definitely not recommended for those who have not played CTHCC, you will get little to nothing out of playing this. If you have played though and loved the characters, this is a short and fun little addition to that story.",

Weep silently and live vicariously through sprites on your flickering monitor.  But you may not influence their story. That privilege has been rescinded.",

However, this installment is just a visual novel based on the same characers and locations of the original. I hope they complete the story with the 3-quel and we'll have a chance to see the act perform ! Also, I'd appreciate voice-overs and game-like freedom.",

In fact, if they had an auto text, you wouldn't need to press a button at all only to pick an episode. I wouldn't mind if the story was different or entertaining but it's exactly the same as the first where there's little character development and story. All that's changed is that there's a few new characters but you'll never learn much from them. The game hinted there'll be another installment. I hope it'll actually be like comedy club or have any kind of gameplay at all.",
