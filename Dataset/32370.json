I never really played it that much, although I did complete it and so when I came back to it as I was older, I had vivid memories and details that made the game seem more enjoyable. Every playthrough is amazing, and surprisingly never gets boring. The plot is amazing, although sometimes predictable, and each character has their own background story to do on the side. You can progress with each member and learn of their past and what they want now. With the character story progression, you cna find that 4 or 5 of them will let you into dark or secret parts of their lives that let you venture out and help them cut ties, deal with loose ends or help them find peace. The only downside to this is that you cannot do every party member's side stories, only those you progress well with first.  The games engine is out-of-date, however it doesn't take out any value from the many, many play throughs of the game I have completed. The game is simple, yet captivating, and each playthrough is just as good as the last. With the ability to add mods, textures, story-lines and unreleased content, you can be sure to find something new to explore or give yourself a new perspective to enjoy.   I could honestly write so much about this game, but there is too much. I can just never play the game without finding everything; doing all of the sidequests, talking and exploring. It's old, it shows little age, and it'll always be one of my favourite Star Wars games of all time!",

If you don't know the story already then don't spoil it for yourself!   To truly get the full game experience, you will likely want to play through at least twice, once as a good guy and once as a bad guy.  While it was impressive and considered groundbreaking for its time, I would stand it next to many modern AAA games. It is definitely a game that has stood the test of time, as many others have said.  It's an absolute steal if you manage to snag it on sale price but I had no hesitation paying the full price for the mobile port.  If you have issues running it, you may need to tweak some settings using swconfig.exe in the Steam install folder. As of yet, I haven't had any issues on Windows 10 although I have heard other users have.",

The Star Wars universe feels alive and welcoming in this game, complemented by solid RPG mechanics and an amazing story. Sure the graphics are outdated, but that shouldn’t discourage you from diving into this game. As a GM and amateur game designer, I’ve learned valuable lessons in character progression, level design and overall plot development. If you enjoy RPGs and never played this game, do yourself a favor and buy it. I should also say that the combat isn’t very intuitive, rather more tailored towards strategy, but that’s not a bad thing. I found myself often pausing the game to analyze my surroundings and make the best decisions I could.  The game is based on the D&amp;D 3.0 ruleset and it brought me nostalgic tears of joy to have that system powering my journey. One thing I wish was better implemented though, was the Light and Dark balance and point acquisition. I felt like we needed more meaningful choices and moral ambiguities to spice things up, but that might as well be just my personal taste.  I haven’t played the sequel yet, but I plan to. I’m now hoping for a third game, with updated graphics and no compromise on mechanics and storytelling. ",

The first thing to note is that the game is quite buggy, crashes occur at random and minimizing will periodically result in a crash as well. There are not enough auto saves in the game so SAVE OFTEN. This will prevent some serious frustration. The second thing to note is that the start of the game can be difficult to sink your teeth into. You may find your interest is not aroused immediately, just remember to give it time. I had to put the game down several times at the beginning as my interest waned. Come back with a fresh mind and push through and you will soon find the game much more immersive and rewarding after you contend with the beginning. Knights of the Old Republic is the Baldur's Gate of Star Wars games and is one of the greatest RPG's ever made. A no brainer for RPG enthusiasts and Star Wars fans.",

I have played everything from Super Mario RPG, all the way up to FarCry 4 and Fallout New Vegas, no game gives me a feeling, no, a sensation of feeling like a total badass like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. bonus points given due to it being made by Bioware.  Basic storyline: This game is set some 4,000 years before the original trilogy, during this time, the Sith are trying to take over the entire galaxy, just like your average bad guy corporation, after you spend thirty or so minutes of game time aboard a ship that should've been destroyed by the time you first opened your eyes, you already will have the basic controls down. After a few hours, you will get the force, despite this. I still tended to stick with the tried and true rifle-type weapons, even though the lightsabers, which come in dual, short and standard types, are incredible to look at and use,    RPG Elements: The greatest asset in this game, to me, is the ability to modify certain weapons and armour, including lightsabers and Jedi Robes that turn you into a walking laser sponge, the addition of a conversation system was one of the first examples I've seen, and was used later just as innovatively in the Mass Effect series.   Final thoughts: I love this game, it's light-hearted, but can be serious at the same time. I never had as much love for the second KoTOR game, because it didn't feel like the same game, if you're either a veteran of RPG's or are a kid just starting their journey into the gaming world, this is one of my personal top picks, it's fun, it can run on a potato, and for the hardcore Star Wars fan, it holds a little surprise from the comic series.",

This game is one of the best, all-time Western RPGs. Yeah, it's showing its age compared to more modern RPGs. Yeah, the combat system is clunky and easy to exploit (the AI's pathing is awful). Yeah, the graphics aren't the great thing they were back in the early 2000s. But the real heart of this game is the story and characters. It was one of the first games of its kind and wasn't afraid to take risks, paying homage to the old Star Wars trilogy while creating its own interesting universe and characters. I had this game as a kid on my old Dell (it was piece of junk) like ten years ago and I thought this game was the ♥♥♥♥ back then.   Basically, you play as a Jedi trying to stop the Sith from destroying the Republic. You can use the Force to bring unholy destruction on the dirty non-Jedi plebes or even just use blasters, because lightsabers are for the weak.  Generally, the choices go between being the nicest guy (or lady!) in the galaxy, or being a total ♥♥♥♥. But there's a lot of good writing you don't see in a lot of modern video games. Especially from your companions (9 of them in total).   I'm able to get it running on my MSI laptop w/Windows 10, so I'm not sure the difficulty others are having. I disabled movies and it works just fine (you're not missing out on anything essential with the movies). Also, get Flawless Widescreen from somewhere in the internets if you have a large monitor, it helps a bunch with some of the visual glitches users run into.

KotOR is a classic RPG with honest-to-god stats and skill points, an increasingly rare sight in these, the days of merciless streamlining. The graphics are obviously dated (but not an eyesore), and the combat finds a comfortable balance between simplicity and the necessity of pausing to issue commands to your party.  To fans of the Star Wars franchise, the world of the Old Republic will be familiar, but also incredibly alien. Unsurprisingly, the writing is clumsy by modern standards, equal parts railroading and patronizing handholding. You get the sense that each line of dialogue was written to leave an opening for every question you can ask, and characters have no problem imparting upon you the same piece of information a dozen times over the course of a conversation. In spite of this, however, the world makes it incredibly easy to immerse yourself in it.   Even with its shortcomings, KotOR is undeniably the genesis of the modern RPG, the proto-Mass Effect, and although you might not get it on with 100 year-old blue aliens, you can't help but feel that this is where it all began.",

            "review_text": "You know, every couple years you have one 'pearl' in every kind of genre.  2003, BioWare and Obsidian gave us 'Knights of the Old Republic' or short: 'KotoR' And this game IS absolutly amazing. WARNING: May include spoilers, even though I´ll do my best to keep them out.  KotoR plays like 4000 years BBY (for not SW Nerds: Battle Before Yavin, or 4000 years before 'A New Hope'). Darth Revan and Darth Malak, two heros of the Mandalorian war, a war that could´ve destroyed the Republic, return to the galaxy as new Dark Lord of the Sith. Darth Revan, the leader of the newly 'build' Sith army wins one battle after the other, before he´s betrayed by his student Darth Malak, who wants to rule on his own. Now that we know a little bit about this games backstory (which is also included in the game and one central point of the plot), let´s get down to the mainstory.  You´re a soldier (or one of two other classes), recruited for duty on the 'Endar Spire'. While you´re resting, the Endar Spire gets hijacked by the Sith army. You try to fight your way trough the enemy, while you do your best to reach the Jedi 'Bastila Shan', an important role in this war because of her 'Force Meditation'. As you´re unable to find her, you make an emergency landing on the planet 'Taris', which is confronted with a sith blockade. On Taris you´re trying to find Bastila and afterwards leave this planet.  As soon as you found her (after doing some favors and a veeery terrible first 2-3 hours), you leave Taris and travel to 'Dantooine'. As soon as you arrive, your Jedi-Training starts and a long journey to save the galaxy begins...  Even though KotoR is already 11 years old, it still has some good graphics to offer. Surely there are so animations that look kinda strange or even some textures which look 'washed-out', but it´s still a pretty game. You travel to different planets, which all have their individual look. As we´ve seen in BioWares 'Dragon Age 2', this isn´t something they´re always able to achive ;)  Also, some of the characters faces look kinda mechanic. They have a disturbing lack of emotions, espacially your main character. Yet they´re able to eradicate this by having absolutly professional voice actors.   The atmosphere created by a very typical Star Wars score, pretty graphics and very well written (and spoken) dialogues is intense and believable, espacially as you´re reaching the end. Planets like 'Kashyyk' create their own unique flair and are very well translated from the source-material. Especially the dialogues do a good job of delivering story, feels and atmosphere and serve a very wide variaty of emotions. But as we all know, that´s something BioWare has mastered over the years.   The character editor is also nice. Even though you don´t have that much influence on the appearance (as you can only decide how your character looks by some different faces, without having much influence on them), but you´re able to build a charater you want through the variaty of stats and attributs. A good and fair skill-system keeps you motivated to level up and the (even though it´s very limited) customization of your weapons will enable you to create a very individual character.   I won´t say much about the story, but.. it´s absolutly amazing. I finish this game at least once a year (also KotoR II: TSL, which in my opinion is a little bit better, even though it´s an unfinished game) and I´m still enjoying it. It keeps you motivated to go on, find all this different NPC´s and involves you in a story that (at it´s time) was a amazing thing for the SW franchise.   I recommend you to buy this game and enjoy it. I´ratte it with an 8.6/10. It´s a classic. It´s an example for BioWares brilliance. Buy it now and you will have 20 hours of fun in a world that wants to be explored!",

I'll cut straight to my main gripe which admittedly comes from my expectations compared to reality. Not only do blasters have nowhere near the impact they had in the movies (and they retain their clumsy and random nature) but also everyone has swords. At first this is confusing, but when you replace blaster with bow in your mind it starts to make sense. That's because weapon statlines are straight out of D20 analogues. Mechanically this is fine because it creates some balance between melee and ranged, but thematically it just ruins the experience when you just want to blast some thugs and move along.  That is not to say that the star wars paintjob is bad: the story and characters are great! I just was dissapointed with how the game played. I recommend it if you're desperate for a star wars RPG and can put up with the combat. I've enjoyed it, but only despite the gameplay rather than for it.",

Next, your teammate AI is equivalent to a 5-year-old when it comes to enemies, especially if they just come out of combat. If there's a herd of kathak hounds 20 yards out and they're about to die, they're gonna jog the distance and let off a few rounds before it occurs to them they might bleed to death before they pull a trigger any more. The graphics are kinda cruddy, but again, it was made for XBOX classic, so notm uch you can do to help that. As for positives, the lore is a nice bit of fun to sink your teeth in to if you're into that (I know I am), and if you set the difficulty right for your level of badassery, the game can be challenging and fun in it's combat. the skills allow you to tackle problems a multitude of ways, as are expected, but the persuade skill becomes moot fairly quickly when you become a jedi and get access to the force persuade ability.  In summation, if you're willing to fight through a few crashes and some crummy graphics, and you're a fan of Bioware RPGs, I recommend it.",

Sure the menus are clunky and textures show their seams from time to time, but the meat of the game, the plot and the character development, is still fresh. The story arc, like with the original Star Wars trilogy, is better if you've managed to avoid key spoilers. Even knowing what's going to happen doesn't stop the journey there from being wonderful because the main plot is secondary to the events happening on the planets involved in it anyway. In true Star Wars fashion, the mission at hand has our heroes hopping from one planet to the next and each layover is focused around getting entangled in the goings-on of that place and its people rather than moving the plot forward. Captions are a necessity as some speak in their native tongues, further driving home the fact that the galaxy doesn't revolve around you as the player. The world and its people feel alive, though the lack of player accommodation can get a bit tiresome. The world of Kotor may not be an 'open-world', but with a seedy card game-based gambling ring, a struggling racing circuit, and plenty of side quests, there are too many distractions to call it linear either. The same can be said for the physical act of playing the game as well. Straightforward violence with all its lightsaber dueling, blaster shooting, and Force pushing is always an option, and though it is a fantastic spectacle of parring and dodging, the fun of it wears out quickly. Thankfully, a number of encounters can be bypassed with a clever application of a character's skills. Computers can be hacked to shut down security systems, derelict droids can be repaired only to be sent against their former masters, and enemies can be persuaded to disband before a conflict even arises. For a game that was designed with the original Xbox in mind, there is a surprising amount of freedom in how the game is played.  That freedom is echoed in the game's approach to the player character's companions. Though only two can be chosen to leave the ship at any time, they all hang around and level up either way, meaning the dynamic can be altered to suit a situation as it arises. Simply talking to your companions can reveal a good portion of their character, but it's the personal quest each companion has that acts as their turning point. How players react during a personal quest will affect their compatriots for better or worse, providing some bit of control over their personalities, and giving the player the option of role-playing with the group dynamic in addition to their own created character.  At its core, Kotor is about a group of heroes struggling against the dark side of the Force while traveling through hyperspace and interacting with a wide variety of alien species, just like any good Star Wars episode. But Kotor offers more than just lightsabers and blasters, and it never loses sight of the legacy it's adding to.",

Otherwise i say buy it, though there is a few discrepancies about this game if you are looking to get into it.   1. It does have dated graphics, being made back in 2003, though for most the graphics aren't everything and haven't aged that badly in the last 13 years.   2. Some people have reported a problem with Windows 10 not being able to run it, or graphical meltdowns. I have yet to experience this problem but thats just something to look into.  and 3. Save often, things happen in this game, especially with glitches, and losing data due to not saving is alot more frequent.   Other than that, I highly recommend this classic.",

The story is pretty decent and easy to follow even if you have no clue about the Star Wars universe. The setting is convincing, you have a lot of things to do and the NPCs are very interesting. The combat on the other hand is kinda old school, from a time where dice rolls were a thing (they're still a thing in some other games), so don't come expecting a 'Mass Effect combat' like I did, but it's decent if you know your way around the character creation. Don't be afraid to use guides and manuals. I could just don't recommend this game after all the frustration I had with it, but in the end, that's impossible.

KOTOR is one of the best roleplaying games I've ever played. Apart from the infuriatingly ugly jedi robes in this game, this might be one of the best titles ever.   Another thing that I should point out as a serious mistake from the developers side, is that you can only have 3 active party members at a time. Instead of such a set up, I'd have preferred if encounters were just that much harder, and you'd need all 9 or however many party members it is you have.   Many party members end up just being 'extras' in the story, only taken out for air when you realize it's been a while, and you need to level them up, and possibly unlock some dialogue with them.   Many other games pull the same stunt, such as Dragon Age or Mass Effect, and it's equally silly. If you have the man-power, use it!.   Apart from that, this game, being a Star Wars game, dives head first into the lore and setting for Star Wars and introduces villains and heroes that can compete with the heroes from the original trilogy. The plot of the story is, I'd say, even better than that of the original movies, and much more immersive.   Gameplay wise, the game is very similar to dragon age origins.   Any Star Wars fan should play this game. Any RPG fan should play this game and become a star wars fan.",

            "review_text": "Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a story based RPG full of lovable characters that you will run into as you progress through the game. The start of the game has you pick your class. The options are Scout Soldier, and Scoundral. Each class has they're benefits but does not effect the over all story. After you finish the first part of the game and are on the first planet Taris, the game can feel a bit slow at times but after you get off the planet the game opens up. Just like any other RPG you don't have to follow the main story and can go off Bounty Hunting, Swoop Racing, ect. The game is based off of a Light Dark system, meaning if you do bad things you will be more to the Dark Side and that can effect the story. Same with the Light Side. Now we have the basics out of the way lets go into more detail about the gameplay. The fighting is based off of a turn based combat system which can feel a bit clunky but, that's usually what you get from turn based games right? The worlds are open world but small. Which can be a bit dissapointing when you are exploring for about 10-15 minutes and come to a dead end. The game runs smoothly for an old game but I'm not sure how it works on Windows 8 or 10. It should work fine on all of the other platforms though. If you are a Star Wars fan I would recommend giving this game a try. It's one of those must play classic Star Wars games. 7.6/10",

But time has been cruel to this one fine game. Obtained off steam on one of the many many sales, I thought it was a steal! My new-age Win 8 should be handle it. Yes, saw online a few minor problems here and there but should be able to figure them out. It was a lie. Money spent, and wasted before it even left my pocket. Hours spent tinkering, all for naught.  Would I buy this game, yes. Yes, I would IF I had a promise of it working the way it should. It is a wonderful RPG, one that my own children enjoyed when I managed to get the first level to work correctly. But, until either steam comes out with a patch/fix/undate to correct win 7-8 issues, or I somehow snag and get running another old machine running XP, this is one game that will only be running in my memories.",

The writing, while overall is fairly good, sucks on an interaction level. The conversations are laughable and make it hard to immerse myself. I found myself clicking through conversations after I got the jist of what it was about. Also you can tell Bastila you love her at the end and I had little interaction with her throughout the game. I never once had romance options until that part came up and it was ridiculous that she even believed I loved her. Little quirks in the writing like that is what makes this writing laughable. Also this isn't a point against the game as this one came out first but the story is essentially the same exact one as Mass Effect. Come on Bioware.  The action takes hours before it stops being slow and boring and a pain to get through. It really only picks up when you become a jedi and only after you get a few powers in your arsenal. And by the way I hated Taris. I hated not being a jedi it was soooo boring. But I must say after you have a few powers and some jedi in your crew it becomes a lot of fun disabling people and watching the lightsaber fights. I had way more fun the last half of the game than the first half. There is a lack of powers and thats disappointing but oh well.  Overall I was annoyed with Taris and the Starforge and its continuous waves of enemies. But overall looking back I enjoyed the experience. I found myself grinning at the end when receiving the medals. For what it was I had fun. Its not supposed to be The Force Unleashed and I wasn't expecting that. I'd recommend it to people who love Bioware or love Star Wars or even people who like a good RPG. I have not played 2 and I plan on trying it out soon. ",

I enjoyed the newest movies and found the older ones annoyingly outdated (cause they are) and seem to like only half of the games they release (KOTOR, Force Unleashed, Battlefront, ect)  I remember playing this old game back when it released by xbox, what a hell of a time and that didn't change, good or bad, This game had plenty of awesome and fun stories and side quests but has many annoying bugs to go along with it.   You explore the universe for an ancient weapon the sith have been abusing to gain the upper hand on the republic, if you do not stop them, life with be forever in the death grip of the sith. You will become a hero (or villian), but of what tools you will accomplish this and with what companions is your choice.   The game runs on a rolling system, you attack in turns (its very fluent, don't worry) and can queue up moves and abilities to make micromanaging your squad (up to 3 characters art once) less difficult.   From different types of blasters, vibroblades, lightsabers or grenades, you can customize your character to fight the way you want to. You can modify your weapons and armour, granting different stats like stunning or extra damage, and even change the colour of your lightsaber. Oh, lets talk about lightsabers.   I don't want you to think the others weapons are underpowered, but lightsabers are by far the strongest weapons in the game (lets be honest, its a ♥♥♥♥ing lightsaber) and they will do the most damage even if you aren't specialized into using melee weapons or moves. I leveled up the entire game using blaster and explosives and once I got near the end of the game I equiped a lightsaber with end game mods and just destroyed everything with my white hits. I mean use whatever you wish, but your life will be so much easier if you just USE THE FORCE.  KOTOR will give you a solid 40-50 hours of gameplay if you read all the lore, talk to all the extra characters and complete every sidequest (except racing, ♥♥♥♥ racing) and it requires no grinding at any point, the worlds and levels will level you accordingly and very nicely.   Graphics are dated, but what can you expect from such an old game. Nothing really bad, just clunky animations and very straight movements, but you forget all about it once you get into the lore and story thats around you.  I found weapons and armour sometimes appeared invisible, you still had the items equiped and they still worked, you just looked like you were wearing nothing. Another glitch froze your controls so you could walk unless you interacted with the enviroment, switch characters (rotating from companion to companion) could sometimes fix it but I found myself saving and reloading to fix it. This probably happened 3 dozen times in 40 hours of gameplay.  Solid SW RPG that will give you plenty of hours to kill.  Personal Rating: 4/5",

Anyone will notice right away, the game has a strong emphasis on story, and its excellent. There are characters to fall in love with, characters you will grow to dispise, and characters that you don't know whether to trust or not. It gives a great feel and can keep any RPG fan coming back.  The graphics are also something to be praised. Many licensed games have the unfortune to not have much money put into them; KOTOR immediatly shows that it is the exception, having (for its time) some really nice textures, animations, and visuals.  The pros to the game is that it is the first real feel to be both a jedi and a sith. I mean really, there is no better feeling than saving the galaxy, or if you have darker inclinations, slicing some guy up because he looked at you funny. While the combat is not exactly balanced or the most stategic, it is still fun. There are some really cool animations, like jumping in the air and coming down with your sword, and one must still consider weaknesses and strengths of enemies and party characters.  There are a couple (if unimportant) cons. For example, some voice actors are constantly reused through the game, and it is easy to come across an NPC that looks just like you. These problems, however, just beg for an hd update, whether offical or fan made.  Overall, KOTOR is awesome. If you do not own it, its a bit a shame, as you are only hurting yourself.",

            "review_text": "You may have heard of the new MMORPG, Star Wars: The Old Republic. If you are a huge SW fan like myself, skip over that for now and consider buying this game. Even though it has many flaws, it's quite fun.  What separates this game from the rest? Simple: you are directly responsible for how your characters acts towards others, deals with situations, and evolves to meet your own personal taste. The game is styled quite similarly to Neverwinter Nights or Dungeons and Dragons- you pick a class, advance levels, and choose abilities and skills you yourself are interested in. Will you be a valiant Jedi knight? A grey Jedi? Or perhaps a Sith Lord? It's all up to you.  As far as the story goes, good God- it has everything. Over 40 hours of gameplay is crammed with interesting and vibrant characters, from Bastila, the nagging stereotypical Jedi, to HK-47, the homicidal droid obsessed with killing everything that moves. There's a little bit of everything for everyone- mystery, intrigue, conspiracy, romance, you name it, SW:KOTOR has it.  Now, what do I have to complain about? A few problems occur when playing this game. The original release was from 2003, and somewhere between then and now, a few rough spots cropped up in the game's ability to work at 100%. The screen resolution won't perfectly fit, and leads to you being forced to play in a black frame around the game itself. It's a little distracting at first, but not too bad. However, one HUGE problem I encountered was the frequent crashing of my game. Every half hour or so, it'd freeze and shut down, leading to some paranoid saving antics. It was incredibly frustrating, especially when you were forced to go through a long cut scene...again. I think an attempt was made to fix it, and towards the end of my run it wasn't as frequent, but the crashes never really stopped.  In game problems are sparse as far as the plot and characters go. Everyone is fleshed out quite well, and you learn quite a lot about everyone in your personal entourage. There is, however, one thing that bugged me a lot. The romances. Jesus. I don't know WHY they picked the two most unlikeable and whiny characters as the main romance options- they're both ridiculously obnoxious, and as soon as I realized who my character was supposed to end up with, I started leaving the guy behind all. The. Time. You have the option to turn down their advances (thank God), because otherwise, this complaint would be a heck of a lot longer.  All in all, this game is really an enjoyable experience. The plot moves forward and engages you constantly, culminating in an awesome revelation I didn't see coming. The characters are all believable and the banter between everyone is often hilarious. Would I recommend this? If you have a lot of patience for a few technical difficulties, then yes, I would. Besides the crashes, this game is one of my personal favorites and it introduced me to the RPG genre. Absolutely wonderful and full of beautiful environments (especially from a 2003 game), Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a fantastic gaming experience, and I've played it through twice. If you have a long weekend and plenty of hours to kill, let yourself sink into the world of Darth Malak and the Old Republic- it stands strong and carries its own weight even today.",

Letting you choose which side of the force you will side with, or attempt to keep a balance of both. No matter what you do, your decisons impact the outcomes of the story in a meaningful way, influencing your companion's opinions of the player character, and even altering their final fate. It can be short, speed run can be done in as few as 8-10 hours, but it is worth it. I have played this game at least a dozen times, and it's sequal is nearly as good.

I recently finished the game for the 4th time (though this was my first play through on pc rather than xbox) and there were still interesting story line pieces and such that I had missed.  It's absolutely, without a doubt, worth the price, even if you only plan on playing through the main story line without doing much extra. The graphics aren't the best, which is to be expected considering the age of the game, but the story is great and the game play is, too. If you're a Star Wars fan and interested in a great story as well as a fun and often challenging game, then you should definitely consider playing KotOR. You aren't likely to be dissppointed.",

They made great games because the industry wasnt fat with mediocrity and advertising was limited to a niche market: the gamers playing the game. This forced studios to care about the title and make absolutely sure they got it right. 2)There were uncharted areas in gaming and boundaries were constantly being pushed back. Voice acting, dynamic story affected by the gamers choices, challenging rewarding exploration were just a few. Bioware constantly pushed the limit with these aspects of gaming and more. Another oldie but rarely talked about goodie in the annals of gaming history is Jade Empire. It was a playtest of sorts for exceptional storytelling, expanded good vs evil story dynamic, and an exceptional combat mechanic.  3)It's not a sequel. New stories, or in this case, a familiar setting used to spin a new canon excite me. Granted, sequels have their place (KOTOR2, Fallout 3, ES IV,V) but, as in hollywood a lot of retreads and remakes have been hitting the market recently. We need new blood(as much as i am looking forward to FFVII remake, i am apprehensive about it as well).   What this game got right is almost too much to put into review. The graphical fidelity is still pretty good. Character models are obviously dated and animations are clumsy but the scenes and backgrounds are very good. The storytelling is beyond excellent. This and KOTOR 2 are the gold standard that all other games should try and achieve. Difficulty is challenging without being impossible. It is a pleaseure to see the DC stats on items and get a sort of 'in between' perspective of mechanics up front and behind the screen. Voice acting is exciting and it holds one of my favorite pseudo-villians of all time in it. No spoiler, you have to play it to discover who/what i am refering to.   If this game released before your time, i challenge you to discover the roots of some truly great games today.

A must have for all Star Wars fans. This game is the same high quality you expect from the movies and I woud argue even better than the movies. Choose light side or dark side. What you do and say effects your light side and dark side alliance. As well as the end of the story line. Knights of the Old Republic 2 is a great follow up. After that if your still not satified I recommend reading Star Wars the Old Republic: Reven. A real page turner in it onw right.",

The game is amazing as it gives you choices that affect the outcome of the game and also which path of the force you go down. You can also kill depending how evil you wish to be, your companions but this is a choice and the game is full of them. It also has a deep love plot making the game also fun for people who want affection in the game and try to exploit plots with each charcters. I also think the leveling up system is simple and easy to understand which is very good and helps for new people trying to play this. Last the game has a sequal and I have also played that when I was younger and own it on steam also and it has a great story and tells you what happens after you complete this one. The bad points are there are minor issues which i notice where the grass was in the sky, this never occured on the XBOX version however that was the only bad point of the game. I rate this a 9/10 game, I never had any crash problems etc with this game only that the grass was in the sky on one of the planets but it really didnt effect me as I know its still an amazing game.",

While it might not have the same sense of scale that something like Baldur's Gate II or Fallout does (which isn't say the game is small by any means), it matches them easily on ambition. True to any Bioware game it is filled with characters that feel fleshed out and fit into the universe they've been carefully added to, characters you come to care about that have interesting stories of their own. One of the things I found most interesting, playing this game again and again over the years is that it still holds up. It still has a great story, it still looks pretty damn good (considering it is over a decade old), and it is still just flat out fun to play.  For anyone who hasn't played this game at least once in the last decade, what are you waiting for? It is a classic in every sense of the word.",

Only downfall is the combat, which can be a bit laggy and turn based, however it can be easily overlooked. Difficulty is just right and you'll lose 30+ hours in here. Then you can do it again...

It has the bioware touch and anyone familiar with their games will know what to expect as far as the choices you can make and for a star wars game it's as close to the star wars game we all want as it gets.

NPCs can box you in, they can get stuck without you noticing that you leave them behind, and one time I glitched through a wall and started running on air for a large section. However, there are worse bugs, that makes you need multiple saves to avoid starting over: If you reload a save while disguised, you will be recognized and instantly die, for instance. The worst part isn't exactly a bug, but if you manage to build your character wrong, the finale will become exactly ten times as drawn out. ...and the finale is outlandishly hard compared to the entire game. Add to that the character animations being weird, a card game that is the only way for you to grind for money, and dialogue trees that you plow through patiently while looking for hidden options.  The story is pretty decent, though. It's just that how hard and long can you go on about the force? This game goes on about the light side and the dark side of the force from start to finish. ...and I get it: That's the point of Star Wars. It's just that when the force concept can be summed up in about five minutes, it tends to get repetitive after a couple of hours.  ...so once I'm done with this game, if I'll ever manage to get through the finale, then I'm done with KotOR, and done with Star Wars games in general.

Then you can customize this character with different abilities that make your character good or bad. Now about the story, It is a very good and decent length. And depending on your choices in the game it changes some of the outcomes of different parts of the story.  BAD: Now I don`t have to much to say about the bad parts of the game but there is some things to point out. During my play thorugh I experienced some glitches and bugs like party members walking funny or glitching in one place. Then I would like to point out that you can very easily reach the level cap in the game. Now in that case that means you can`t learn all of the abilities you want to learn.

Arguably one of the best single player RPG's ever made, KOTOR paved the way to what we now call the modern RPG. This is where Bioware really shows its roots, and why they have stuck to them. Many people look at this game and think of how awesome its gonna be to play until they realize there is a deep dialog aspect (for its time, to me still beats mass effect or TES). The combat seems lacking in your first hour of ever playing this game, but i find it to be very engaging. Modern games like the Dragon Age series shows how far they have come to adapting the combat style from KOTOR. The voice acting in this game is great, aside from the basic repetitive motions characters make during dialog. Many great voice actors and actresses are featured here, like Jennifer Hale, the voice of Bastila, also played the part of Female Shepard in the Mass Effect series. Only games i know with a better voice cast are Fallout 3 and New Vegas. The replay ability to me is really high, but to be honest, i believe thats based on the nostalgic value i have for this game. The beginning planet Taris gets very boring after multiple playthroughs, but i still really enjoy certain parts of it that really hit me in the feels.   I can safely say that this is my favorite single player RPG outside of Dark Souls. This game is friendly to people unfamiliar with the lore and vice versa. If you enjoyed any Bioware RPG, this is, to me. the root of them all. For people who absolutely cant stand Star Wars, try Jade Empire, it is just as engaging but with a different setting, and some argue, with better delivery.",

I like that, which is why I give it a +. +Each Jedi class gives you an unique ability! +Attributes can be upgraded. Attributes can help you through your quests. I recommend upgrading your Constitution to make a lot of stims. They can really make you powerful.  SOUNDTRACK 10/10 ++Beautiful soundtrack, truly a masterpiece I must say! -If you are a fan of the Star Wars movie music, I am not sure if you will like this one.  IN-GAME SOUNDS 9/10 +The sounds are pretty good. Nothing seems to be out of sync. +Typical lightsaber sound. Love it! +Voice Acting is perfect! Sometimes a bit too loud but nothing wrong about it.  STORY 10/10 ++An amazing story. It's an RPG well made. You can either go to the dark side or the light side. Each side changes the story completely. Quite a plot, a bit cliché and an unexpected turn out! +Side missions are long enough to enjoy them, expecially from your own companions. +You can romance in this game! Which seems pretty normal considering it's Bioware.  GRAPHICS 8/10 +For being a game from the year 2003 it's still playable and the graphics are alright in my opinion. +Mods that you can use to make it look better, which I find important.  OVERALL RATING - 9.2/10 - EPIC  If you love games where conversations matter, where making history matters, where you can change the fate of the entire galaxy.. then this is a game for you!

This has got to me in my top 5 best games ever. Now onto the review  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is at the top of the pedestal when it comes to Star Wars video games. It has everything you could ask for: A great story, great combat (Dated, yes. but very enertaining), and classic graphics. Bioware really outdid themselves with this game and it shows in the gameplay. There are a few glitches here and there but nothing compared to what the recently updated sequal had.  The characters in this game are people you can relate to much like biowares other RPG's such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age. You will be able to get to know each characters backstory and get to understand there unique personalities. Each character has different specialties and as they level up you can upgrade them to fit your playstyle same as your character. There are different specializations such as: Heal Injury (Which determines how much you heal when you use a medpack), Computer Use (Which determines if your able to hack a security console and how many parts you have to spend to do it), etc. These all determine which paths you can take during scenarios such as if there is a door and you need to find a key card but there is also a security console nearby if you have a high enough Computer Use skill you can just hack it and open it up.  The combat is based off Dungeon and Dragons type gameplay with each attack relying on the game 'Rolling the Dice' and depending on how good of roll you get you could miss or hit. There are a multitude of weapons that fit any playstyle. If you would rather sit back and shoot your enemies theres blaster rifles and pistols, if you want to get up close and personal there are two handed and one handed swords and later in the game, lightsabers. One you get to a certain point in the game you will be able to have access to force powers from both the Light and the Dark Side. Many you will recognize from the movies and some are new.  The game has a morality system based off of the Dark Side and the Light Side of the Force. If you do something considered bad or evil such as decide to kill someone who surrended you will gain dark side points and if you do something good such as give money to someone in need or reject a reward you will gain light side points. All of your choices matter and there are multiple different ways you can play the game as there are also different endings as well.   As i said earlier in the review this is one of the best games i have ever played. At 10$ you can not go wrong. And god forbid the game goes on sale buy it as soon as possible, you will not regret it.  My verdict: 11/10   ",

I bought the multi-disc retail version when it first came out that is either lost or somewhere else now, bought it on Direct2Drive several years ago which was on account I don't have the info to to access it. Also the first few runs I never beat the game because I never could get off Taris and the planet bore me to death. It wasn't til last year or earlier this year that I finally just sucked it up and blew through Taris to where I could actually enjoy the amazing post-Taris game.  Pros; One of the best Star Wars stories, if not one of the best RPG stories in general Great Voice Acting The great balance between serious and humorous scene make BioWare games enjoyable. While not as Robust as the Character Creators in later BioWare games, you still have some humble options of what class and look your character has. Though some of that becomes negligible later on in the game, which I'm not gonna bring up because of Spoilers. One of the greatest plot twists in an RPG.  Cons: Needs native Widescreen/Mod support like it's not-as-enjoyable successor Character Creator is nowhere near as robust as Mass Effect or Dragon Age (Some of the choices for your character are downright laughable and cartoonish) Companions can block you from going places so every once in awhile you need to become then and move them outta the way. Don't use auto-level because the game will only level up treat injury while your points are best spent on things like Persuade and such. Current Widescreen workarounds cause the game to crash or take multiple boots of the game to finally work, sometimes the game will crash at the worst times possible, like after or during you leaving Taris before you can save again so you need to redo that whole battle with the Sith and the Exchange all over again.  That said; you can see all the cons are technical issues, but if you can get over those, the game is still quite enjoyable.",

There are a few issues with the steam version of this game... - Rarely, but does happen once in a while, loading your game gets frozen and stuck and you need to restart your computer or reload the game a few times to get past this freeze spike. I've also had it happen where you can NEVER get back into that game file even after re-installing the game... Fortunately this was on my playthrough right before the final boss so no big deal. - Doesn't like to be picked up in either Game Capture or Window Capture on OBS. Even Monitor Capture makes it blink like crazy and receives bad. Though this isn't a big deal for playing the game privately, as is usual for single player games. - Kotor II on Steam has full controller support. This game has None and no way to bind any within the game settings itself. To me this is a big deal, but luckily I found a sufficient for me way around this anoyyance for an alternative solution. I streamed from my laptop onto my desktop connected to a TV so I could play while laying down away from sitting in a chair. No controller support but it at least got me range away from the table.  That's pretty much it from my experience as I recall. Don't buy it for $10 though. Maybe 5. Try to do what I did and catch it when it's at 4 or less. Otherwise you're better off searching around the internet for a better version of it and probably cheaper too.

The fact that they would charge $11 for a game that does not work the vast majority of modern systems without a warning as to this seems ridiculous to me. I really, really, REALLY want to love this game like I did in the past, but it won't even open on any of my PC's no matter what fixes I use. After weeks of trying to get it to work, and being unable to refund a game that does not work, I have given up. This is simply unacceptable.  Sadly, I do not recommend anyone purchase this game in it's current condition.   Edit: For any who may wonder, my issues are as follows, and each time I solve one, another appears.  1. Game crashes upon opening (disabled movies to fix) 2. Opening menu is blank (no fix, but you can still randomly click and open things) 3. Can not click text (menu and conversation) or turn camera to the right. (disable hardware mouse) 4. Can not see conversation text (need to change resolution to fix) 5. Can not change resolution in game as the resolution menu is blank (downloaded Flawless Widescreen to change it externally) 6. Can not see text, map, or most of HUD. (found 1366x768 on FW fixes that) 7. Game starts crashing upon opening, again, but will work every 1 in 50 to 100 tries, and no, I'm not exaggerating 8. Upon opening the screen goes black (have to alt+tab, then alt+tab back in to fix) 9. HUD doesn't always get displayed and I can't target enemies, meaning I have to exit and try to get it to work 1 in 100 times again 10. Game crashes randomly during play (no fix) 11. Save files become corrupted (no fix)  I realize there are some other fixes, such as windowed mode, but sadly mine refuses to go into windowed mode at all no matter what angle I try to go at it, and if it does work (very rare), it crashes right away.  My issues are identical on 3 different PCs, and 1 laptop.",

This game and Neverwinter Nights 2 marked when BioWare no longer wrote complex and believeable backgrounds. The plot twist was forced and the villains were one-dimensional. Most characters did not live up to the inventive characters of BioWare past like Minsc and Boo, Imoen and the children of Baal, tormented Jaheira, or the reabilitating Aerie.  It's perhaps fitting to the Star Wars universe, which isn't aiming for nuance in its absolute good-vs-evil setup. What redeemed the films were the superb character arcs, which KOtOR severely lacks. It's telling that the droids were the most memorable NPCs in the party.  Quests are largely parcel deliveries and the role playing is largely choices between good, evil, or neutral. Choices are unforgiveably shallow when you can only adopt, kill, or set free the puppy.  The mechanics are heavily dumbed down - spells, blaster customization, and skill development felt as flat as it did in Neverwinter Nights, from which it is based.",

The story is decent, though sometimes poorly presented. Voice acting and the character's scripts are not particularly impressive (except HK-47 who is awesome). The combat is pretty simple and the game has just enough character customisation to wet your mouth but not quite enough to satiate your hunger.  Overall, it's Star Wars and if Star Wars is even remotely interesting to you then you'll enjoy the game just because of that. I don't know that I would recommend it quite so quickly otherwise though due to a myriad of technical flaws and an overabundance of boring pointless dialogue.  I enjoyed it but It was a bit of a slog to get through. Any of the newer western style RPGs are probably better ways to spend your time (Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Witcher, etc) and anything older probably has more nostalgic classical charm (Baldur's Gate).  I know a lot of people like it but does it still stand up? Kind of, sort of, maybe.  ---  You'll probably want to google for a resolution fix to unlock the higher resolutions and make the game less of an eye sore. Also compatablity mode is required if you're on newer versions of Windows, and I found the game crashed intermittantly for me anyway. Save regularly.",

I dont mind the graphics. it is okay.  the voice acting was great-  however. a huge downer is the gameplay itself.  the combat system is ♥♥♥♥ and the controls of the game (moving, etc. ) is driving me insane. everytime im like 10 m from an enemy my game pauses. sometimes my character freezes for no reason,  usually, a game with a good plot is all i need, but with this game, the gameplay was a huge disappointment.   Im not a starwars fan, but i somewhat like it. i thought this game was right up my ally, but it wasnt.    IF you ONLY want a game with good plot and all. then by all means proceed. the plot was good. no denying.  but if the gameplay itself has a value. dont bother.",
