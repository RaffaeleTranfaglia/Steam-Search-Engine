            "review_text": "So you've put in the work! You created a pitch black cape, grab a black leather glove (from OJ Simpson fame) taped a butter knife to your wrist and put on a raiders hooded sweatshirt. You're totally ready for a new adventure as everyone's favorite assassin Enzio Auditore. You start up the game excited to finally see what really happened during the events of the previous game.. (cliff hangers tend to do that)...  Nothing more needs to be said as the real life story isn't driven forward much at all in this game, but that doesn't detract away from the brilliance of this wonderful game..  The Story.... Back again As Desmond Miles, only this time Desmond Miles is in a coma, brought upon by his interactions with the Apple from the previous game. Fear not, instead of seeking out medical attention, or generally waiting for Desmond to wake up as going into a coma is a serious side effect of the Animus.. his trusty companions decide the best course of action is to strap Desmond into the Animus for yet another fun and exciting adventure as Enzio.. Immediately you'll notice something Enzio is a geriatric now. He's old, he looks to have aged about 40 years since Brotherhood, but we'll let that slide because in all honesty Enzio is probably the coolest fictional old guy since the Dos Equis guy..   Enzio finds himself in Constantinople, on a mission to discover the secrets of Altairs (the assassin from the first game, for those who don't already know) Waltzing up and just going into the library would be too easy.. we are talking Assassin's Creed here. So after a nice little tutorial missing you're thrust into Constantinople, all alone, broke, and injured.. The story picks up from there... or it doesn't depending upon how you look at it..  The Gameplay.. it's fairly familiar by this point, run, jump, collect, kill, sneak... a few major additions in this game was the hook blade, a nice little addition, also you can now create bombs, lethal, stun and Smoke varieties.. These are pretty much game changers once you get used to how they work.. Another addition is red and yellow trails when you open up eagle sense. It's kind of cheap in all honesty, but sometimes you just want to watch the world burn.. Towers used from the last game are back.. only now they are no longer called Borgia towers (since the Borgia family was pretty much removed from the AC universe in the second game) Now they are known as Dens, which you unlock to gain a new hideout for your assassins.  Another neat addition to the game was den defense.. (which is a simplified tower defense game), while the concept was pretty neat, in 24 hours of playing, I only managed to initiate 2 den defenses.. The first tutorial one, and the second one happened not too long after that.. It wasn't for lack of trying as I left my suspicion meter in the red for hours, and paid close attention to the map, wandering around various parts.. Needless to say I think this aspect was broken in my game for some reason..   The recruitment system is back, and it's been expanded upon quite considerable. You can now reach level 15 with individual assassins, and you can set them as leaders of the individual dens. Furthermore, the quest system seemed to receive an overhaul as well. Now you can have your assassins take over a city, (instead of just quest there) when you're in control you receive cash, experience and bomb making materials. A neat addition to say the least, especially as money in this game is fairly difficult to come by until you've opened up almost all the shops and banks..   As well as playing Enzio, you'll get the chance to play as Altair.. although his missions are fairly limited but are really interesting and help show what became of Altair after you left him..   Overall.. I'd recommend this game, although after playing Assassin Creed 2 and Brotherhood, this game felt like more of the same, where as the previous games seemed to get better as time went on. Although it could have just been me starting to get burned out on Assassin Creed. Also the game didn't feel quite as epic or as well put together as the previous 3 games.. Not just the story but the bugs, glitches, and general unstable nature of the game.. especially when closing the program down, which crashes 90% of the time. Almost inexcusable at this point in time, matters are made worse because the crashing often times results in a locked up computer.   *Quick Note.. Multiplayer is still alive in this game, but it's pretty much on life support. After playing Multiplayer long enough to get level 20 I can say that any new comers to multiplayer will be in for a very daunting task. You'll likely be matched with level 50's who have all the best perks equipped.. Although after I gained some levels and learned the game it was more fun than I expected.. Although some things a bit cheap, that comes with almost every online game..",

            "review_text": "This game was looked down apon by many fans of the Assassin's Creed series, and for a while, I was one of them. After being persuaded by a friend to continue playing the game though, I realized the story and detail this game has to offer.  The game has a slow and rather unintriguing start. The introduction of the new mechanics, environment and people can drag on and get a little boring, but the game soon picks up. This edition of the Ezio trilogy takes him to the city of Constantinople, where his aim is to find a way into the library of Altair. Meanwhile, turmoil is brewing in the city with the dispute over the next Sultanate, and the underground Byzantine templars that are against the Ottomans. Ezio finds himself in the middle of this mess, and as usual, badass-ness ensues. As the game progresses, the story gets more intricate, with more historical figures introduced and a few plot twists.  The environment of the game was different in some ways from the previous settings, but still enjoyable. The addition of the hookblade made the game so much better, with its ziplines and fast climbing. From the marketplace to Topkapi Palace, there is a lot to explore and plenty to do. Oh, and that is without even mentioning Cappadocia, which has a breathtaking environment.  The gameplay itself was great. I did not make use of the bombs that much when I played through, which I do regret since it seemed like a great feature. Despite this, the storyline contained plenty of action and explosions along the way! Not going to spoil much, but it was certainly a thrill with some of the more advanced weapons that came during the time period.  There were some downsides to the game, but they were pretty insignificant. Many criticized the Den Defense feature, which is understandable, but did not affect the game too much. The storyline only required it to be completed once, and as long as you kept your notoriety low, there was no need to worry. In the end, it gave players more of an incentive to be careful! :P  I don't really want to spoil any more, so I'll just end this by saying that AC:R is really underrated and definitely deserves its place in the Ezio trilogy. It delivers great endings to both Altair and Ezio's stories, and certainly makes them memorable. The game was by no means at ACII's level, but it was still amazing and a ton of fun.",

            "review_text": "As with Assassin's Creed Brotherhood you play as Ezio Auditore, this time in the city of Constantinople. Ezio is now looking for several keys to a vault that Altair sealed centuries ago. Each key lets you relive a select memory from Altair's life, which is where the revelations happen. In this way it gives closure on both Ezio and Altair's stories at the same time.  The game shares a lot of similarities with Brotherhood: the majority of the game takes place in one city where you liberate areas and recruit new assassins who you then send off on missions throughout the region.  Graphically Revelations is definitely the best-looking game in the series so far.  Ubisoft made a few gameplay additions to spice things up. My favorite is the new hookblade, which makes climbing a breeze; it also has other applications like ziplining between buildings (why these ziplines are all over Constantinople I have no idea) and the ever-useful hook-and-run maneuver. Bombs are interesting, but I didn't use them much except when the game prompted me to.  Another nice addition was some backstory for Desmond. As you might know, at the end of Brotherhood Desmond falls into a coma and they put him into the animus to keep him from losing his mind. There you get to play through a few first-person levels that tell us about Desmond's life before he got mixed up with Abstergo. It's nice to know more about the person who you are playing as, and solidifies him as an actual character rather than simply the guy who you have to go through to get to Ezio. The Lost Archive DLC does something similar for Subject 16, and it was very moving. I would recommend it to those who are interested in good storytelling.  This may have to do with the fact that I completely ignored all side missions during my five hour push to the end of the game, but Revelations seemed much shorter than the previous games in the series. I only spent 19 hours in the game; for reference the amount of time I spent in the other games are as follows: Assassin's Creed: 22 hours Assassin's Creed II: 39 hours Assassin's Creed Brotherhood: 36 hours  Overall I would recommend Assassin's Creed Revelations to those of you who felt that Altair and Desmond felt hollow in the previous games and those of you who are obsessed with plotlines.",

            "review_text": "AC: Revelations is the bookend on the Ezio arc, tying up his story and neatly bringing it all back to Altair, from the first game. I really like the decision to give Altair a final conclusion and make it playable. It adds depth to the story and to the lore when you connect these two characters, centuries apart. It gives a nice sense of history. Then, of course, there are the Desmond sections. Personally I've never hated them as much as some, mostly it just seems like a missed opportunity. The potential is there to add a lot to the story but it's just under and/or incorrectly utilized. That being said when it isn't forcing you through inane free running puzzles you do learn a little about Desmond's past, about why and how he ended up where he is.  For the most part base gameplay is unchanged. The biggest differences are the addition of a hook blade which mostly effects free running (higher climbing jumps and zip lining), bomb crafting/use (use is up to your play style. You don't have to use them but they can be useful), and a tower defense mini game that is thankfully entirely optional (which begs the question 'why is this in the game?'). The combat is a little less of a grind with the counter-kill/kill-stringing system which can have you speeding through a group of enemies in a flash. Although the ability to kill an entire group of guards without breaking stride makes you wonder why they bother having the fights in the first place. Unfortunately this tweaking of the combat system has continued the trend away from actual planning and assassination toward big raging battles and waves of enemies. There are a few forced stealth sections but those are almost always very linear with a clear path and sequence of actions. It's really a shame because they give you so many weapons and skills but don't really give a lot of ways to fully utilize them in a stealthy way.  Overall this really is one of the better games so far in the series. The game world is still huge and beautiful and stabbing guards in the neck from the third story doesn't really get old. If you've played the rest of the excellent Ezio story arc then this is a must play. If you haven't then you should go play the others first then pick up Revelations.",

For starters I loved AC3 even though everyone says it was a disapointment, I really enjoyed it. Now getting back on topic, Assassin creed Revelations will forever hold a dear place in my heart and will forever be in my top 5 games in all time. It has great music but the music was not as amazing as in other games. The game play is really similar to the previous game but the hookblade is added and is a amazing feature that is unique only to this game. The storyline has to be one of the best Assassin Creed storylines I played. The map is kinda cramped but ehh what can you do am I right, you do with what you are given. The reason people get this game and why this game is ranked so high is not because of the hookblade or the new map or the same old mechanics, it is ranked so high because of it's storyline. It's the final game of the Ezio trilogy and it provides the essential closure that every gamer craves and needs to basically needs to not die emotionally. If you are a highly commited fan, and have played the previous games before this game, this game is a must have for every single fan. You can get away with not having a game like Assassin Creed Liberations, but if you do not have Assassin Creed revelations it is like reading a book and not reading the conclusion, the ending.

There is a beginning section where you are wounded and need medicine, limiting your climbing abilities and forcing you to make do with what you have, which are haystacks. A nice way to get people gradually reacquainted with how you do things in the AC series.  Constantinople is now your playground. Everything you could do in Rome, can now be done there, and more. The Hookblade serves as an additional climbing method. Whereas in Brotherhood, you could leap and grab hold of a normally unreachable spot, you can now use this technique to climb even faster by launch yourself a second time. A rush to do several times in succession, though for some reason it still functions perfectly for dual assassinations.  Bombs can be put together now as well, allowing you to carry three types. To distract, to kill and for tactical purposes. For every type, you can put together several ingredients with different effects befitting their purpose. Distracting bombs will usually distract guards and such, while lethal bombs will kill in various ways. Tactical bombs can range from smoke bombs, to bombs that drop fake coins to lure a crowd of people, and much much more.  Whlie an excellent game, I can't say that you'll be able to fully appreciate the game and story if you haven't played it's predecessors. If you have been following the AC storyline, you'll enjoy the progress of Ezio and the hidden history of Altaïr. Especially the latter's closure is a potentially emotional one.

As well as updated graphics and mechanics, this game introduces the hook blade used for moving quickly though the districts but also intresting and original combat tactics. The use of bombs has also been expanded creating unique solutions to large patrols of guards. Ezio can distract guards by creating divertions, frighten them by filling the bombs with lambs blood, or simply blow them up!  As in the previous two games the notoriety system adds a level of caution to the game steering the player to use tactics and stealth, rather than brute force to resolve confrontations. This, to me, makes a lot of sense as Ezio is an older and even more experienced assassin. Couldn't recommend this more espesially as it's normally ont £2.50 on sale!",

I loved the way the characters looked in Brotherhood, but now Desmond looks like Adam Sandler, Ezio's head is more of a Gorilla shape/void of emotion, and the first thing I noticed about Altair is that his nose is bigger than his whole face. Speaking of Altair, the voice actor they used to replace him; while I understand the change of accent seeing how he is in that type of area, I don't like the fact that Altair's voice is deeper. Another thing that sort of bothers me is the aspect that your Templar meter goes up everytime you renovate a location, I understand why they put this in considering you're building up in an area where they would be looking for brotherhood activity, but they could have at least implimented more than just bribing Heralds and killing witness.",

If you do play the game straight through you will be surprised on how short it can be. There are only 9 sequences to complete.

The missions are somewhat lackluster as well. While the challenge feature from Brotherhood remains present, the 'challenge' seems to have been left out. The challenge requirements for most missions are laughably simple, and often can be accomplished without any real difficulty.

As far as the plot goes, it is an incredible wrapping up for the II episode and, unlike AC Brotherhood, all the action is focused on Ezio Auditore, which I really appreciated. Both graphics and audio are a little bit better than AC Brotherhood, but due to the immensity of the world do not expect to get the best out of the market.

But It is a nice tie up between Ezio Auditore and Altiar.  You can build your assassin's up in this game. That part I liked. You can increase your income and free most of the city between the two factions. That part I liked. Keeping your notarity down, swimming, etc. etc. The mounted turret in the later sequence was probably the most hated thing I could think of, not to mention the 75% impossible ♥♥♥♥ to get 100% sequence. It is for more patient people then I to achive that amount of BS. Your 'mad skillz' to climb higher walls were replaced with the 'Hookblade' which, the idea is nice. It allows you to Counter steal in the middle of battle and get medicine rather then dying becuase brutes done ♥♥♥♥ed up your face. Though most of the heavy armor have been replaced by more skillful guards which makes the challenges very ♥♥♥♥ing hard.  The story is the only reason why I played this game which, in my opinion, should only be half the reason, not the whole reason you play a game. Without going much into it, you visit Altiar's old home before Constantinople, finding a big locked door and leading you to hunting down keys in the city. True, the plot has completely diverted from 'Listen, learn, kill' from assassin's creed 1 to 'listen, learn, lara croft treasure hunting' but it really is a nice change of pace. I lost track of why I was killing so many damn people in assassin's creed 2 to be honest. Even the in game diagram didn't help me. Anyways, you help this Sophia in her attempt to get books and civilizations earliest Blu-Ray disks in order to open the library of Altiar.  The endgame takes a weird left turn as to how people stopped attacking you with the most predictable end in-game. It does explain some of the visions from Assassin's Creed 2 though. All in all, Not my favorite game in the whole series so far, but It's a tie between this and the first assassin's creed. Assassin's Creed 2 is still my favorite so far.  P.S. I'm not too concerned about if this review is helpful or not, I'm just writing these to bookmark if I've played them all the way through or not.",

Story was more fun than brotherhood, but couldnt compare with the AC2 story of course! This time, the city is constantinople.  Again, we come back with brotherhood assassins crew that you can send on missions to become better assassins. Again, i spent more time buying all the shops and monuments and playing with my crew than running the main mission (I actually got the master assassin armor before i finished getting the first crappy leather set of armor from the shop! hahaha). There is a concept of setting up a new den after you capture templar regions in the city. Similar to what we already had in brotherhood, but this time, the templar can capture it back if you're not careful!  Also, we get introduced to all kind of bomb making. Actually, this game is fantastic for terrorist in training. The amount of bombs you can use is just insane and pretty overpowered! It's a good thing you can only bring 3 bombs of each type on you at a time or you would do nothing else to assassinate your targets but bomb them! But then, they put bomb making tables everywhere in the map so you are rarely more than 1 minute away from making more bombs! And you always get more bomb making ingredients than you know what to do with (i never bought any bomb making ingredients. In fact, i sold so many ingredients for big $$$! Especially at the start when you are poor, its a fantastic way to make money).  The gameplay is awesome and fun. What is also very special about this game is the templar you kill. In all the templar kill you did in the earlier AC, templar always die with arrogance and naked lust for power that you cannot root for them, they are insanely evil and corrupted by power. But in revelation, it's quite the opposite! Each templar death made me question my motives as an assassin! The templars that we kill always had pretty good reasons to do what they did and they sincerely believed they were trying to help humanity become better! And they always said: What are you assassins doing to help humanity? And we just can't answer positively that question. I'm telling you, each templar death is not rewarding but very troubling! That's freaking AWESOME in a game!!! Completely different from the other templar death in previous AC.  Now the only lowdown would be when you go back into the animus and play as desmond. Man that was freaking boring. I don't know why they even bother with that part of the game. Fortunately, you can skip it and get back to play Etzio which i did since it was far more fun.",

The setting in Konstantinopel is refreshing, but much after a few hours running through it you do get bored at the rather repetitive environment. You just don't care about learning the map by heart, compared to the experience in Assassin's Creed II &amp; Brotherhood. The minimap is rather limited as you very often pass by points of interest because it is so small.   The hookblade is one of my favourites. When I encountered it I thought to myself; 'why wasn't this in the previous games?'. It's uses are many, and it's fun to get creative. The combat system is pretty much the same as always, but it lacks something, something from its prequel. Everything is just too simple. If I'm surrounded by 7 enemies then they should attack me, not stand around waiting for me to kill them one by one. The addition of bombs are really helpful at any given time. Customization is a love-interest of mine, making this great. The bombs seem to reflect the player, and with great accuracy.   The storyline is very interesting. The story of Ezio is awesome, and Altaïr as well. Desmond is more of a question mark though. His background story is... enlightening, but the 'maps' are a bit hard at some points which seems rather strange. The story does however feel like a dissapointment. It is too short. I know that I play games too much, but this ended rather quickly. And since the gigantic cliffhanger left behind from Brotherhood, Revelations feel like either a sidenote or mistake. The end was very pleasing and somewhat epic in Ezio's story, but I want more. No spoilers, but it felt rather epic when Ezio and Altaïr were together.  To sum up: the storyline of the game is short, unmotivated, teasing and at some times even infuriating. The inventory of weapons and tools gives you a wide range of possibilities, but together with a dumb AI the entire combat system has become too easy. Still, it gives you the liberty of playing the game the way you want to, as you can use this arsenal either to distract hostiles, kill them, ghost etc. The setting is too big, too repetitive and one-sided. This game may be a must-be in a gamers life, but it is in many ways dissapointing. If I want to powergame anything from the series, it would either be Assassin's Creed II or Brotherhood, not this.  Still, this IS Assassin's Creed. Ezio and Altaïr may grow a full beard, but their skills only get sharper. Nothing is true, everything is permitted.",

I would only say that it lacks a really detestable villain, like Brotherhood had, and not -quite- as many interesting supporting characters, however, still entertaining. Even the tower defense minigame is strange in this series, but fun. All in all it's a fantastic adventure with challenges and goals, with some clever and satisfying revelations, both to Ezio and Desmond.   Well recommended for if you enjoyed AC2 / Brotherhood.

            "review_text": "So, far I have played AC3, AC, AC2 and now AC Revelations. But apart from AC, which was a horrible game, just a next step after Prince of Persia, I think AC Revelations is the weakest point before the Connor's story. I haven't played Brotherhood yet, but I've heard it's the best in Ezio Trilogy.  Don't get me wrong, ACR is a good game, definitely worth the price. The main story is interesting, the combat is smooth, most missions are fun, there are new weapons and tactics, the narrow streets of Constantinopole are perfect for parkour. But the game experience itself just doesn't feel that fresh anymore. I guess, there's just that many AC games that you can play before the excitement starts to fade.  So to sum up the pros and cons...  PROS  + Good main story, but not as good as before or after + You are not forced to play as Desmond, if you don't want to, in order to proceed. It's constant Ezio/ Altair experience + Combat and camera is working perfectly (it was a big problem in previous parts), so you always jump and land, where you want + Narrow streets of Constantinopole are perfect for parkour. You can cross the whole city, without touching the ground. Ziplines are also a nice introduction + Some new useful weapons such as bombs, a crossbow and a hook blade. Parachutes are very useful, too  CONS  - Income problem is still not fixed. You're short of money in the beginning, and you're millionnaire, when you don't need it anymore - Only 4 locations (Masyaf, Constantinople, Cappadocia and Maiden Tower) - Boring side quests (except for Master assasin missions) and grinding challenges. Ultra-boring Desmond sequences, which are basically about Desmond's memories and block building - Kind of short, compared to other parts - The game does not introduce all gameplay elements equally well. For example, Mediterranean defense, assasin assignment, assasin promotion, den attack triggers are not explained enough.  I didn't play the MP, but if it's the same as in AC3, I don't even want to try.  My overall rating 7/10.",

This game is very enjoyable indeed with the new features and stuff. I liked it a lot and i still like it like the previous AC-Games. Parkour, Assassination, Stealth, Tactics, Surprises, Brotherhood, Optional-Rewarding-Missions, Story, New Wisdom and more. The protagonist is back and wise &amp; dangerous as ever but you also play the previous protagonist again.  PRO'S + Have a visit in Turkey Constantinople/Istanbul + Tower-Defence based missions available (Make your stand there!). This one i like probably the most! + Replay the previous protagonist. The actual protagonist is good too. + Challange's and Assassin-Missions are rewarding a lot! + Many varianting memory missions + Like the part with the hookblade &amp; ziplines + You can craft BOMB's! CON'S - However you play the previous protagonist, his voice is DIFFERENT and not original! - UPlay fux everything up! I had to 'modify' something before i could play it! No help from support! - First civilisation do not fit in such games like this IMO - Mentioned before, that some optional challanges or missions are rewardable you can (and i did) right on your start of the game gain the rewards for the very BEST EQUIPMENT available ingame, and as the game progress you will find nowhere better stuff than you got rewarded! This makes this same a walk-in-the-park. - Game is very short!  I do not recommend to pay for this game since the developers have gone on a moneyhunt and are releasing since AC3 non-assassin games with cheap tricks. AC - Revelations IMO was the last entertaining and yet an assassin game. However it is still worth playing. I do not support the dev's any further because their products have gone worse and I still have the inability to play it 'clean' without UPlay.",

The gameplay itself didn’t change much from the previous games, the combat animations are still the same but improved, Constantinople also has an Assassin presence, as their mentor Ezio recruits and trains them as he did in Rome, calling upon them while taking Bizantine Templar strongholds or sending them across Europe on missions. Maintaining the banks and shop management, adding to this there is a notoriety consequence that calls Templar attention.  The time period is very well portrayed, the city is beautiful and filled with monuments and landmarks like the Hagia Sophia, this does wonders for the game’s immersion. It was also a refreshing change of pace from the Italian cities, combined with the great soundtrack; it truly is great to play a game like this.

Assassin recruit system are not improved but more inconvenient,recruits' weapon types are 'predictable“,but sometimes not,another glitch,maybe.The UI or maneuver system of Mediterranean arrangement of recruits are not easy to be used or noticed,for many players did not 'notice' it and did not know of that there can be more than 12 recruits.

The whole ending sequence is just very dull and unimaginative. The whole game just feels like it was built on something great, but actually managed to turn it into something boring. Also, just a warning: Ezio's face looks very very very old and Desmond's face looks nothing like Desmond.

To put it another way, this games moved the Assassin Creed storyline about as far as the second Matrix movie moved that series along - which is to say, more of the same damn thing and a big to be continued at the end. If anything, the storyline was cheapened considerably by a backstory presented on these terrible surreal levels where you only hear people from Desmond's past talking while you try to get from one point on a surreal map to another.  Desmond storyline changes from being young bartender kidnapped off the street by an evil corporation who he knows nothing about and forced into a machine that transports him back into a war between his ancestors and their sworn enemy - a war he knew nothing about and did not know he would become part of - to a guy who really, really should have seen all this coming and not been so confused or surprised when the templars eventually abducted him to use him for their evil purposes. Way to completely ruin the storyline of the first few titles. Unless I missed something when playing the first few titles, Desmond didn't know who Abstergo was initially, why they wanted him, knew nothing about the Assassins and temlpars, had no idea he was born into this war. In Revelations, we learn he grew up on a farm run by the modern day Assassins, was forced to train every day, and was told, repeatedly by his parents how he would oneday become a part of this battle. His parents even told him all about Abstergo and how evil and corrupt they were. He knew who they were, knew they were after him, and he was trained for 16 years by assassins... why did he even need the bleeding effect to gain the skills of an assassin... he was raised by assassins... and told he was an assassin... Is this not a gigantic plot hole?  Moving along, there are unnecessary changes to the gameplay, again, which means you have to learn all over, again, the best way to fight. For me, this was the worst port to PC in terms of gameplay mechanics. In the preceeding titles, fighting was very fluid and natural whereas Revelations felt almost clumsy by comparison. There are several new components to the game, including a tower defense mode, which didn't really advance the game or make you feel like an assassin, as well mentoring and overseeing many new assasins. I actually enjoyed recruiting new assassins, but once you have them all you do with them is send them on missions to level them up and make you money and influence- missions you never really see or get to play - and they either succeed or fail which gives you more or less influence over cities you never really visit in person in the game... Victory can be ensured for each mission as long as you send your best recruits, which just makes this component of the game boring and tedious.  Revelations took me less than 10 hours to complete the storyline and unltimately stop playing (and I like to take my time - compare this to the 39 hours I spent on AC:II, the 32 hours I spend on AC:Brotherhood, and the 22 hours I spent on AC. In terms keeping my attention and keeping me interested, this game just paled by comparison to the other games in the series. Add the awful backstory for Desmond and the sort of far fetched 'time to save the planet from solar destruction (not templars)' and we end up with a dissapointing addition to the overally story.  Even a bad assassins creed is still a good game, but I can't really say I recommend this one.",

I try to finish the game with 100% complete, and it cost me only 50 hours, the game is lack of content, the storyline is very short and the secret extras (like new assassin suit or weapons) was too easy to unlock.   The Assassin's creed Revelations still a good game, but not that perfect, I am enjoying in the mutiple player games, the mutiple player is better than single player, more fun and exciting.

            "review_text": "Assassins Creed Revelations review!  HOLY ♥♥♥♥. What an awesome game. I went straight from AC:Brotherhood to revelations and was dying to know how it all wraps up. Ezio's journey from first becoming an assassin in ACII all the way to the end is incredible. He's a phenomenal character in gaming and should be up there with some of the greats. His character and personality shines through unwavering till the end. I felt like I was actually Ezio in all the various locations in which this game is set, having to follow his tale through to completion. If you have ACII - AC:Revelations, I highly suggest putting away some time to play this great trilogy. Whatever your thoughts on Ubisoft are, they nail these three games and should have just stopped there. (More on that later.)  SO, combat is obviously a major part of the gameplay here, and since AC:B they refined it even more. The combos are even more satisfying when dealing with multiple enemies, the executions are even more gratuitous, and the connectivity between between targets is so much smoother. It really feels like you're total badass. It's awesome. With different weapons there's a big difference in how combos and executions are... executed. Timing is key, as heavy weapons vs daggers vs hidden blades vs bombs vs projectiles are all extremely varied in how one must play, and win a fight. Ezio's style also comes into play since introduction in ACII, as he's now an experienced killing machine in AC:Revelations. His smooth, graceful style from ACII by the end becomes an unstoppable force of blades and death dealing in his later years.   As usual, the voice acting is killer as well as the dialogue itself. These games, especially AC:R are so meticulously scripted it actually feels like these are real people behaving as people do. 10/10 for all that. Also the random NPC's interactions while running through the streets or climbing buildings are spot on and really ad to the overall ambiance of the game.  OK, on to the annoying stuff. Every time you renovate a shop, you're stuck there for about 10-15 seconds while the building animation happens. Since there are about 150 shops, there's a lot of renovating to be had. There's also a LOT of unnecessary animations just to press ESC or TAB to view the map. I'd say a good 2 hours from my play time in AC:R is just animations from renovating a shop or viewing the map animations. Also every time you interact with pretty much anything there's some kind of cut scene. Even if it's just a few seconds can be annoying after you've seen it 30+ times. Such as: using a pidgeon coop, bomb box, ANY shop, storyline door, ANY door, loot chest, loot body, picking up a body, fast travel, assassin dens and a quite a few others. There's also no option to skip actual cutscenes, so that makes replaying certain memories for 100% sync really annoying when there's a two minute cut scene with randoms.   Overall, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome trilogy and should be played by everyone. If you have the 60+ hours, (and I think most of us do) play these games! The story alone could be a movie someday. Besides the minor animation delays, these games are great. I'd highly recommend these three games to anyone that wants to play an immersive game that takes you to a different time and place.

Constantinople and Byzantine history are personal favorites of mine, so being able to explore the city as it was at the turn of the 16th century is a real treat. Completing Ezio and Altair's stories was a poignent and satisfying experience that began with the original Assassin's Creed years prior. The Desmond stuff is tolerable, like usual, but not obnoxious or particularly in the way, not like usual. If you played AC2, and maybe Brotherhood, and then lost steam for the franchise, go ahead and finish Ezio's story with Revelations. It's a great ending. I wish I could say the same for Desmond's story concluion in AC3, but that's a review for another game!",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: If you're a die hard fan of the franchise, this is a great game to get on sale. With an average completion time of 12 hours (based on  howlongtobeat.com)  and lots of collectibles for you completionist junkies, you should have a great time. The level design is on point, and the cities are anything but boring. But I found myself lost in the plot (in a not-great way).  --- I must a cardinal sin - I never played the first Assassin's Creed. Because of this, I felt as if the Altair storyline felt shoehorned and out of place. I found that they tied up Ezio's storyline quite well, but it would have been even nicer if they should have somehow made a transition into their third installment into the franchise. Desmond's line was also too short and not memorable. Characters were also nothing of the ordinary, but it was neat to see a grizzled Ezio well into his 50s-60s leaping towers like a Parkour Youtuber.   Without stepping on spoiler territory, the storylines and objectives were a bit muddled. However, I found myself forgetting less about my objectives and more into the rich map design. It's showcased in its entirety by lengthy and enjoyable missions. One quip from a design standpoint - both stealth and assault are favoured, though there are missions that are stealth only. For the most part, the designers respected these divergent playstyles.   The most common criticism in the game would be its wonky minigames (tower defence missions were painfully slow and poorly choreographed). I'm inclined to agree.   Though the campaign alone is worth the price of admission, stealth-loving players that favour the covert stylings of Splinter Cell multiplayer games will sink some hours into it (despite a poor userbase because of age).",
