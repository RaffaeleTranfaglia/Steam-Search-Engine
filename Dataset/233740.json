            "review_text": "Instead of going to Oregon to stake a claim on America's future, you decide the fate of a group of survivors looking for a safe place to live in a post-apocalyptic world overridden by zombies. You travel from Washington DC, that's about to be nuked, all the way to a safe haven in, you guessed it, Oregon. The game is faithful in every way it can be to the Oregon Trail, except where it could be made more thematically appropriate to a zombie apocalypse, with multiple additions to improve the simulation and theming. Seriously, name a feature from Oregon Trail and it's there. Dysentary? Check. Bad water? Check. Tombstones? Check. You get the picture.  Oregon Trail's 'hunting' minigame, being the best part of the original, has become a bit more central to the experience with Scavenging and Jobs using it, with a few others including Defense, Surrounded and Bandit Raid events using the same shooting mechanics.  When Scavenging, you no longer shoot a 2000 pound buffalo to carry back 100 pounds of meat. Instead you rummage around a wilderness, collecting any supplies that pop up (including food, cash and scrap that you can use to repair your car), while avoiding and shooting zombies that swarm in on you. Learning to control the flow of these zombies to reduce the amount of ammo I have to spend was a fun mechanic to master (no doubt aided by my recent experience with Gauntlet), and I must say, is probably the best way to ensure your victory at the game.   In a funny way, Organ Trail is one of the most complete zombie apocalypse simulations I've played, and if you like the genre, you really should play it just because it's a fun game. If that's not enough to attract you, maybe the novelty of recreating the Oregon Trail experience on a modern platform with a modern genre is enough. I would happily recommend Organ Trail even at the premium price of five bucks.",

            "review_text": "I love this game way more than I could put into words. Simple design, easy access, addicting. I would call it a 'retro survival sim': a zombie apocalypse ended the world as we know it. You and your friends try to cross what once was the USA from the East Coast to the West, chasing a rumor known as 'Safe Haven', a stronghold where the zombie outbreak seems to have been controlled. Your job is to admin everything until you reach Safe Haven, that is gas, money, routes, including scavenging for food, at what hours you should best do so, keeping an eye out for your ammo, deciding if you should keep going to the West Coast with your bitten friend or if he is a potential menace to the whole group and should be rather put down, if you should risk breaking your car driving for another mile in the hopes of finding a better trading spot, etc., etc.   These tasks may appear mundane at first, but once you soak in the rather dark atmosphere and realize how close you have become to those pixels with the name of random friends, the game becomes a tragic story of a group just trying to survive and their everyday trying to do so. And you are the leader.   It's so much fun to experience and imagine the situation you go through. One moment you'll think you made a great deal buying that tire for so cheap, the next you'll curse yourself for not having rather invested in scraps. And while on the road, you'll sometimes encounter little 'choose-your-own-adventure'-like events with fellow survivors, some friendly, others not so much, spicing up the experience.  Organ Trail is impressively immersive, given it's Atari graphics and lack of a deeper canon story. It's one of those video game experiences in which the game only makes the rules, while you make the story in your head, and I think this is the strongest point here.  But as good as it is, it has some very nasty bugs that can bring you serious frustration. For example, I just was at the end of the game, a comrade died and the game refused to advance until I fed all of them to the zombies. As if this wasn't enough, the game got stuck after defeating the final boss. After having spend my time carefully administrating my crew from coast to coast through hordes of zombies, this wasn't a rewarding pay off. I just wish such issues were patched already, since they happen relatively often with me, let's say, every 3rd or 4th playthrough.  Be it as it is, though, I can only recommend Organ Trail as a fantastic game for those who like just make up and imagine their own zombie stories while playing along.",

The game has many secrets and unique finds, aiming for a good replayability factor, but these events are so rare (i only came across 2 in 8 full gameplays, when the game says there are over 15) that you won't experience everything this game has to offer. The game is also a bit too short.   There are many, many events and possibilities, but the trailer's makes one believe that this will be also a psychological battle against yourself, with many moral dilemmas and such, when the largest one you will find is pressing a button to kill one of your crew.  6.5/10 ,only purchasable because its cheap , but not for everyone.",

Instead of a wagon, you have a station wagon, and instead of homesteading the west, you are trying to escape the zombie apocalypse... by going west! It might have simple graphics, yet it's fun and challenging. Sadly it does have some boring parts, where you just watch your car move, and terrible things like breaking a battery or someone getting bitten will happen. This makes it very similar to the game with a similar name, where someone will just randomly die of malaria, but the zombie apocalypse setting makes it way better. The resource management is also still there, while instead of hunting for animals, you will be hunting bandits or going for an item while zombies hunt you. Organ Trail is one of those simple games that ends up being pretty awesome. Pimp your ride, ford hordes, survive zombie deer herds, then get your brains gnoshed on by a zombie bear and have to start all over from the beginning... again.",

I haven't really played much, but I have watched Game Grumps play this a bit. If I had to describe the genre it would be towards simulation where you have to manage resources. Combine that with the quirky humor (and pixel art) you expect from indie games.   My only complaint is that the gun controls are kind of strange. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but I play with an unusual control setup so it's kind of difficult for me. So far, shooting the gun doesn't seem necessary to complete the game, but maybe on the harder difficulties will require this more.",

The graphics are minimal, and I honestly applaud that, to many developers think that they need top notch 3D graphics to make a game fun, when you just need to have fun gameplay. This game delivers fun gameplay in spades.  You start off by picking the names of your companions, so you can sentance people you disilke to die or bring friends with you in spirit, after that its pretty much a zombie road trip, bad things will happen, you can try and prepare for it the best you can, but you are on a road trip cross country to reach a safe haven.

I like the click-pull-shoot idea (which is almost impossible without a mouse) for the 2d game, it might be difficult to do at first but it’s a whole different shooting system. I would recommend this game mostly for passing the time though, it is very fun, but not something you (or at least I) would actually put time aside to play. But all in all, this game is definitely worth 4.99. The best part is writing and finding you own gravestone when you die, or when you visit a grave.  Get it.

I remember we had some good times trying to make that trip. My favorite thing to do in this game was to go hunting. It was so easy to point and click at the animal you wished to kill.  In Organ Trail: Director's Cut hunting is not nearly as easy. You have to hold down the mouse button and pull back in the equal but opposite direction to the zombie you want to kill. Over complicated for no reason. This is my only complaint about this game though.  I enjoy that this game brings back all of the old memories of my childhood while simultaneously including a modern spin on a post apocalyptic zombie outbreak. Each difficultly level is challenging but not so challenging that it is super frustrating. This is a great game that everyone can play comfortably without quitting in a thunderous rage.

And that hope is what kept me playing. To make it through. I usually for the most part do not like indie games. But with it's cheap price, and great replay value, I highly highly reccomended this. I would hope for a sequel. But maybe it's better off being a stand alone game. Whoever made this game, I commend you for the great amount of effort put into this simplistic but at the same time, complicated game.  The game is primarly about resource managment, and going across the USA, in hopes of getting to your final destination, 'safe haven' you have to survive zombies, bandits, and get supplies, fix your car, ect, it's based off one of my favorite PC game series, 'The Oregon Trail' I might even argue that this game is a tad bit better than the original Oregon Trail games.

This is a great game to play if you have some time to kill. You can choose to act at your own pace, except when the gameplay moves from it's text to real time play...so it is perfect if you're doing something else.

Next we reach the next area a bit shaken by the loss but the moment we leave Harry is bitten by a zombie. I still had no medkits so I was forced to kill him leaving me Anton and Arya. It was then that disaster struck. Arya was hit by a stray bullet and is incapacitated. He dies quickly as I had no medkits. Me and Anton go far and are very close to the end with us being very healthy. Then Anton is hit by a stray bullet. He is not incapped and we continue but shortly after he is hit again by ANOTHER stray bullet. This incapps him and he dies when a blizzard strikes.

Great time, enjoyed the game thoroughly.  My only complaint was that money was EXTREMELY hard to come by when playing on normal version. This ultimately meant that I died because we ran out of fuel, even though I knew it was coming there wasnt much I could do to stop it. I scavanged 10 times in a row, traded every chance i got, and couldn't find fuel anywhere. I had a multitude of food, scrap, and ammo, but was always dying for fuel and money. I would love to try the combat training but at $80 I don't think I ever had that much money to my name the whole game, let alone have $80 to spare!  Overall fun game, I put my friends' names in the spots and took pictures of the messages as I played and sent the messages to them over text.

Cons:  I understand the need to have a unique shooting style, but seriously? Clicking on the enemy and dragging to your character is a pain when scavenging.  I have learnt things from combat trainers about 3 times. Not because their skill are useless, because they apparantly have nothing they can teach me.

Overall I would reccomend the game because it is cheap, especially on sale, and it is worth the money, but don't expect an easy relaxing game, this is a very challenging and stressful game!  + Immersive + Addictive + Passes the time quickly - May get frustrating due to RNG - Some annoying mechanics ",

Emotions don't come from having pretty graphics.  It comes from choosing between your best friend's life, and those of five innocent strangers. It comes from watching your sister be executed by a maniac when you miss the shot that would save her. It comes from watching your boyfriend get infected, and wondering if you can keep him healthy and alive during the trip.  And all that was just my first play through...",

It's not just a cheesy ripoff either. It is faithful to the source material but it still maintains it's own unique aspects and introduces new 'minigames'. You still have to manage resources and scarcity. There is plenty of scavenging and trading. You're still at the helm of a wagon, but instead of fording rivers you have to ford throngs of zombies. Instead of snake bites there are zombie bites. You still can't carry back all the food.  Oh, and there's lots of dysentery.",

Fashioned in the manner of ancient Atari games they don't interfere with the sheer absurdity players are sure to experience in this hilarious post-apocalyptic road trip across the United States in a station wagon. An obvious play on the caravans of Oregon Trail. Here, players can create several members of their party to tag along with during their journey through swarms of zombies, camps of survivors and trips through the wilderness for supplies.

I'd say the satisfaction is ALMOST as sweet as killing your stupid, stupid tag-alongs when they lose 7 gallons of gas (the only gas you have).  It's cheap, and I'll bet you will have a good time with it, especially if you sank a lot of time playing Oregon Trail as a kid.",
