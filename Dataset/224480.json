Octodad's existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan...",

            "review_text": "This one is a hard 'No' to give. At it's current price, for what it gives, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is NOT worth it. The game's about an hour and a half long, for $15? Now, if this price ever goes down to, say, $5 or so, this would be an absolute 'YES'. Octodad is a funny game, with chuckles throughout, the sheer obsurdity of what you can do is always worth a laugh, the silly theme song is great. However, the game feels like it's over before it even starts.   The last 30 minutes or so of the game are some of the most annoying trial-and-error types of gameplay that I've ever seen. Yes, the controls are bad, I get it. Having to 'sneak' past people is annoying in this, having to walk across a narrow path as fast as you can is also annoying. Instant-death attacks that go through walls and physics objects are also not fun.  But with that out of the way, everything else in Octodad is extremely fun! The writing is silly enough to work, the subtitled blubs that Octodad gives are rather funny at times. The objectives you're given are fun.  But that's really all you can say about this. It's just so extremely short. Lower that price to $7.50 or even $10, and I'll change my review accordingly, but at $15 for a regular, non-launch purchase? Not worth it. Wait for a price drop, or sale.  Edit: To people saying this review is not helpful, please let me know how it is not helpful, and I will work on adjusting it as such.",

A colorful world and great level designs. This game has a lot of great features, such a graphics , Soundtracks, gameplay , hidden features, level design, characters, story, Physics. You are the father of 2 children and with a lovely wife living a normal life ( No spoilers ) And then it gets complicated, and they tell you how it all started ( Kinda ... i am not really satisfied with the ending but whatever)   I really enjoyed playing this game with a controller since it works probably on all controllers.  NOTE : when they say Local coop , it does not mean a friend playing with a different character, ah no you just control a limb of the octopus , 2 legs 2 arms , 4 players each controlling on of those , or 2 players controlling 2 limbs at a time, it can all be configured and customized, i tried it and its really fun    Update , Octobor 17th , new update in the game adding 2 new levels one is a romantic dinner the other takes place in a hospital, both fun and takes about 1 hour to finish both, its good to see they are still adding stuff to the game   This game outdone itself in a lot of aspects. Pros : 1 - Colorful world and wonderful level designs, and characters and graphics. 2 - Unlike most Physx game this is very light on the PC so no 'HELL FPS DROPS' 3 - Great Physics, and fun gameplay trying to control the arms and move around doing stuff and quests 4 - Funny story that makes no sense. 5 - Great soundtracks , and character voicing. 6 - Level editor AND Steamworkshop for some crazy more content by the steam community. 7 - 3 hidden secrets in each level, and achievements and trading cards adds the toppings to the game : ) 8 - Game customization, such as Physics threads control, difficulty, Physics quality ( reduce to increase game performance ) and many more visual/game features    Cons :  1 - notice i said ' fun little game ' its great but finishes kinda quick... 3 hours and i finished it 2 - I kinda hoped for an open world (Goat simulator style) in freeplay menu turns out it was just repeating levels to get the hidden items which is great but yeah i wanted open world :| hopefully i'd find it in workshop 3 - Uh an octopus has 8 limbs and some ( 6 arms and 2 legs as scientists insisted on that ) but this character has 2 legs and 2 arms, dont get me wrong its great but more wouldv been funnier and harder  Overall a wonderful calming gaming experience that is suitable for all ages, a game to play with your family and have a lot of ridiculous fun times 9/10",

            "review_text": "This game was over hyped, over praised and given way too much exposure. It just barely lasts an hour and a half. You could probably boost an extra hour on to that if you want to find ties but that's only if you really feel like you need to.  A lot of people say that this game is 'laugh out loud hilarious' and while I understand that humor is subjective I didn't find myself laughing like everyone else. Every now and then I'd crack a smile.  Something I hear being thrown around a lot by Octodad fans and journalists is that this game is just so 'fresh'. The controls are 'bad'. It's hard to move Octodad, which of course as we all know it's designed to be this way. Doing mundane tasks such as mowing the lawn or making coffee is now apparently 'hilarious' because we can't control our character. Don't get me wrong, I like this idea too and it's fun seeing Octodad flail all over the place but it gets stale fast. So, sure, Octodad is 'fresh', but that freshness lasts about as long as leaving a slice of bread on the counter (i.e not long).  There's really not a lot to talk about when it comes to Octodad. Heck, there's not even much of it to play. If you've kept up with Octodad only in the media, it's safe to say you've probably seen at least half of the game already, it's that short. The asking price for this game is $15.00. $11.00 if you get it while its on sale. However my advice is to wait until it goes on sale for 5 or lower.   There's simply not enough content here to merit the 10 or 15 dollar asking price.",

            "review_text": "Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a fun and fairly original game with a unique gameplay style not seen often at all in games. It manages to be fun, fresh and didn’t stop me laughing from start to finish with the only downside been that I completed it within 2hours, however this doesn’t mean I’m finished with the game I’m still ready to get the achievements and it also supports Workshop that could add hours of fun to the game.  You take control of an Octopus, if you had not gathered that by now, you walk on landing using the two back buttons (controller) or the mouse buttons, I found the controller and Mouse/Keyboard to work just as well as the other and you are tasked with numerous goals per level such as making coffee, stealing cereal, playing mini games and sneaking around stereotypical groups of people.  The graphics in the game are well presented, nothing to over the top and I doubt it would win any awards however it fits in well with the game and the game ran at a perfect 120fps even with 16xAA showing that the game is fairly well optimized to run on PC’s.  The gameplay is mostly physics based, controlling the character though levels, cant really say much more than that, most of the charm is the game is from this and the characters themselves, dim-witted adults and keen children with a mature sense of humour helps you chuckle though the entire game on top of laughing at Octodads poop sense of footing.  I completed the game in 2 hours however I feel for the entertainment value and the price I paid I feel like I already have my money’s worth but still expect me to be jumping back into the game to get the achievements and ties.  I’d happily give OctoDad a 8/10, a very solid Indie game, id love to see a full featured sequel that maybe has more complex puzzles, longer story and more levels, besides that this is one of those games that takes you by surprise at how enjoyable it is.   - Dean ",

It's a short game (longer than DLC Quest but shorter than Portal) and for $15 you might argue you're not getting a lot. This game is fueled by quirkiness, relies on it, really, and its replay value depends on how efficiently you can convert its brand of humor into your personal brand of fun.  I got a few laughs out of it, but also a few frustrations. For the buildup to the final boss you're tossed into an irresponsibly designed level of precision platforming, bad camera, and a floor that falls under your feet with very little conveyance. This is a massive contrast to the rest of the game with its open environments and reliance of a more-or-less static world. I got stuck in the world geometry more than I'd care to admit there, but think of it less as a nitpick and more as indicative of the overall game - I feel the developers got a fun toy (constraint physics), decided to wrap a one-off around it, and ran out of ideas. I really do think this game was intended to be $15 worth of game-hours but they had to piece together what they had and sell it.  Like I said, I'm hard pressed to find $15 of value here. I didn't try co-op nor go for some of 'advanced' achievements but I don't think it would have rocketed this game to a glowing recommendation.",

            "review_text": "In Octodad, you play as an Octopus, impersonating himself as a human dad. Rather self-explanatory title. In the game, you can't move around normally, like any other third or first person game. Since you have tentacles instead of limbs, you have to move your 'legs' one at a time, as well as your 'arms' seperately. The game tasks you with rather dull tasks, such as getting items in a supermarket, mowing the backgarden, or putting burgers onto a barbeque. However, because your limbs are just so hard to move, as you have a habit of your body flinging itself around the place, knocking over everything in your path in your vain attempts to control your Octopus.  In essence, the game is a 3 hour long slapstick adventure. That's not to say however that it's the only humour involved. The voice acting is surprisingly well done, with the long running gag of everyone not seeing through your disguise, to your kid's often insane requests and dreams, such as your daughter wanting to become a unicorn when she is older, not to mention a Supermarket PA who often makes mistakes on the job, to the marine biologists who constantly pick apart the plot of the game.  However, the game has this real kind of Disney-esque humour and heart towards itself, Octodad truly loves his family, and his family loves him back, to his wife and himself actually having a real relationship, even if it is often consciously satarical of suburban family life. Likewise, even the villian is the mad, pamtomine nutcase simply called 'The Chef', who hunts Octodad because he is the only one who recognises him, and even then, his motivation isn't really that evil either.  There are a couple of issues with the game, somethings you're forced to go through vents to proceed, which can be very cumbersome, trying to shove all your tentacles into a tight space. Also, the game features marine biologists later on in the game, where if they spot you, they'll recognise you immedietly, but then later on, suddenly they're fooled by your disguise. Also, the game can be completed in just 3 hours, maybe 2 if you're very efficient about it.  However, with it being on sale, and hopefully will return in a flash sale, which is how I got my copy of it, I whole heartily this, due to it's hilarity, it's heart, and just the sheer happiness this game just emulates onto one's self.",

I don't even remember why I clicked on it. First impressions can make or break a game's selling potential and I know I can't be alone in this sort of off-the-shelf assessment. Such cynicism doesn't do this game justice.  The control scheme makes it unique and is the true core of gameplay - the adventure game key puzzles would be the spokes on that particular wheel. Some people may allude to 'to walk forward you alternate between pressing L1 and R1' (thank you Yahtzee) and... well, the trailer showcases exactly how chaotic this is. It works better than it sounds, a description which sums up this game quite well.  It's a rare game that is actually funny in its own quirky way, and not by the usual use of 'ironic' references. The entire premise is preposterous but the characters are endearing and the developers included their message without having to shovel in hours of exposition. The length is just right for a game of its tyle in that it doesn't become tiresome or run out of steam halfway through. Overall it all blends together into a game is simultaneously one that I recommend but I can think of no good way to market to a developer. You could say it's an ideal example of how Steam is a great platform for the independent developer to put out quality material on the market.",

            "review_text": " Review text copied from my blog,  Sprites and Dice  [spritesanddice.blogspot.com] .  Check it out to see more reviews, editorials, and features!  Life is hard sometimes. Getting up in the morning, commuting to work, paying rent...it can be a hassle. Now, imagine doing all of that while also being an octopus. Makes your day to day problems seem small, doesn't it? This is the essence of Octodad: Dadliest Catch. Hilariously failing at mundane things like opening doors and waiting in line is a joy to watch, especially with a character as goofy and emotive as Octodad.  I'm quite the fan of awkward control schemes. From Katamari Damacy to Surgeon Simulator 2013, I love it when games make me stop and think about how to interact with not only the game, but the controller itself. Much of the humor in Dadliest Catch's gameplay comes from this learning curve. You control each of Octodad's legs and one of his arms individually as the rest of his body ragdolls behind. This makes simple things like traversing across a room difficult, especially when there's plenty of furniture to knock over along the way. There are plenty of input options to choose from, too: a mouse, the Mac's multitouch trackpad, and when the PS4 version launches, even the Playstation Move. Despite the intentional awkwardness of the controls, it's actually rather easy to pick up any of these inputs. I played the majority of the game on my Macbook switching between the mouse and the trackpad, though I was most comfortable using a controller. Regardless of how awkward the controls were, it never felt like I was fighting with them. The way Octodad moves is not as random as it might seem at first, and understanding that is immensely satisfying in its own way.   It's also just satisfying to watch Octodad move and...be Octodad. His facial expressions change depending on the context - whether he's tired, angry, scared, or just blinking, it's hard not to keep laughing, especially when his goofy face is flopping all over the place. Even more hilarious is the sound design - the squishes, pops, bloops, and blubs all have their own humorous charm. Even when listening to someone else play this game without looking, you can tell just how much chaos is happening.  It'd be a shame to bring up the sound design without bringing up the excellent voice acting. Octodad speaks in a series of blubs, and while they sound hilarious on their own, the subtitles make them even better. Octodad's wife and kids are also well-acted, and his kids have some of the funniest dialogue that actually sounds like it would come out of a pair of children.  The game is a little short - it only took me a little over three hours - but is addictively replayable. I almost played the entire game twice in one day because it was just fun to show the game to different people. Levels are densely packed with humorous references to other games, and each has three ties cleverly hidden for the player to find and wear. Each level also has a developer time to beat, and just the thought of watching speedruns and all the things possible within the physics engine gets me excited. There's also a local co-op mode for two to four players, where each player is responsible for specific limbs on Octodad's body. Even when the base game runs dry, there are still tons of levels to download on the Steam workshop, as well as a level editor. I have a feeling that once players get really comfortable with Octodad's controls, we'll start seeing some crazy challenge levels that will require precise understanding of the game's physics engine.  Overall, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is one of the most charming, funny games I've ever played. It's hard not to love Octodad. We all have secrets, and while I've never personally been an octopus, I can understand the fear Octodad has of being found out. He just wants to be loved, and I'm sure everyone who plays this game will.",

In an experience that is pretty much Zoidberg The Kluts the game it was a poor choice for levels to let you fail them in the way they do. It should be about destruction and not skill. The point is that Octodad controlls in a very different way from characters in other games. His steps can be very imprecise, and that goes the same for his arm movements. It probably works better with a controller, but either way the geologists make the game very unpleasent at times. Hiding has an extra layer of difficulty when you seem to bob up and down out of cover. The challenging bits should have been getting the ties and other various collectables, and not just getting through the game. Maybe have some challene levels but the game was sold on hilarious physics and destruction.  The last level in particular is very annoying as I fly off the on spots you can step on. Have some hard steps, but put amount of time to get through it or something. The last level doesn't seems to keep in mind that the movement of Octodad is the whole point of the game with it's hilarious diologue and other bits as a plus.  This game is completely worth every penny, and probably more, but there is definitely room for improvement. I'd say that the user levels would save the latter half of the game, but from the ones I tried most are still based on skill of a crazy kluts of a character.  I hope DLC is released for this game. They mentioned things like aliens, stowing away on another ship, the local mayor of the town, all things that could have some hilariously destructable terrain.",

That doesn't sound like much but Octodad manages to give you very varied objectives based on usually very mundane everyday tasks. From grilling steaks to learning about friggin kelp, everything you do in this game looks hilarious, especially if you have someone playing who is not that versed in videogames.  The graphics are nothing to write home about but they capture the games mood and tone perfectly. Music and sounds are great, still got the Octodad theme stuck in my head after 2 weeks of finishing it, heck the whole intro sequence is just brilliant.  I LOVE IT! But is it something for you?

            "review_text": "Comedy is a rare thing in games. Some developers manage it with a witty script, others with outrageous characters that help lighten the mood, but few hit that holy grail of slapstick laugh out loud guffawing like Young Horses do in Octodad: Dadliest Catch.  Octodad is just a typical guy, trying to make his way through life with his wife and two children, except that he is an octopus and he has the additional burden of keeping that a secret. Dressed in his snazzy suit, most people are none the wiser about his true identity, but suspicions rise when he is spotted acting strange.  In addition to mouse and keyboard control, full game pad support is in place. I ended up preferring playing with a controller, but both work on the same principles. By default, players control three of Octodad's limbs: two legs and one arm. By manipulating their positions in space, Octodad can walk, run, climb, grab objects, and do all of the things a normal human being does. The kicker is that each limb is generally controlled one at a time, and they are all held together with an elasticity that often sends them off in unintended directions.  The result is almost like handing a non-gamer a controller and putting him in the thick of a first-person shooter; there is a lot of flailing around and looking at the ground. It takes a certain amount of brain rewiring to be able to make Octodad move as intended, even when the necessary sequence of actions is cognitively clear.  In any other game, these would be complaints, but Octodad is specifically about being uncomfortable and learning how to function in a body that is almost alien. For some, it may be frustrating, but for those willing to put in the effort, it is ultimately rewarding to learn how to function as an octopus in society. By the end, players should be able to walk competently without knocking things over or punching kids in the face too often.  Being an octopus also affords Octodad some benefits that humans cannot reap, like the ability to squeeze into tight spots or to stretch out over large gaps. Young Horses built this awkward, difficult control scheme, and then crafted environments that take full advantage of its physics.  Where the previous title was more of a proof of concept on the control scheme, Dadliest Catch delves a bit more deeply into Octodad lore. Revealed over the course of the campaign are how Octodad and his wife Scarlett met, when he decided to start masquerading as a human, and why the neighbourhood sushi chef wants to kill him so badly. Of course, how he and Scarlett managed to have two human children is jokingly brought up but never seriously addressed.  You can't fault its originality, though. It's a game bursting with colour and personality, although the chirpy music does begin to grate after a while. It's hard not to love Octodad as he stumbles through life, and the levels are filled with cute references to indie games and developers, YouTubers such as SeaNanners and PewDiePie, and many more.  Truly, Dadliest Catch realises how silly its concept is, and never takes itself too seriously. The writing fits the mood perfectly. Some of the off-hand remarks and terrible marine biology puns are worthy of a few laughs, but the general absurdity of the situation in its entirety is the biggest source of humor throughout the game.  The silliness is conveyed well through the graphics and sound as well. Octodad lives in a colorful cartoon world that serves as a welcome contrast to the muted palettes of more realistic games. The soundtrack is similarly upbeat and peppy, and it features a main theme that will be stuck in my head for years.  Another potential sticking point for some might be the relatively short length of the story. Clocking in at about three hours, it ends before the central conceit starts to wear thin. Dadliest Catch does about as much as it can with its octopus limb control scheme, but it (ironically) would not have the legs to last much longer. I personally had no issue with the length, but those who like to calculate hours of entertainment per dollar may take exception that the main story finishes not very long after it begins.  Alleviating that a bit are some optional objectives for those who want to keep playing. Each level hides three custom neckties for Octodad to wear, each requiring thorough exploration, tricky climbing, or some interaction with the environment. Additionally, each level has a par time to beat, opening it up for potential speed running.  Also included is Steam Workshop support, so users can create their own levels, and a hilarious cooperative mode that allows up to four players to control one or more limbs, requiring an unusual form of teamwork and resulting in an even more awkward octopus than usual. Despite the short length of the campaign, there is enough in place for diehard enthusiasts to keep going for as long as they want.  In the end, I would not be surprised to hear that the Octodad community is thriving years down the road. It exudes a certain weirdness and charm that makes it stand out from a lot of other titles out there, and there are tools in place for it to live on past the point when the credits start to roll. Though it has some issues with frame rate drops and its approach to control is definitely not for everybody, Dadliest Catch kept a smile on my face for most of its duration.  TL;DR: The long-awaited video game adaptation of The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife.",

            "review_text": "A very amusing and cute ragdoll physics game, in which you control a very wiggly octopus--er, I mean, NORMAL HUMAN BEING. The controls are very bizarre at first, but I found myself getting fairly comfortable with them after playing the game for a bit. While the main story and characters are funny and well done, some of the most amusing parts of the game are in the details; the game is peppered with witty references (seen in many of the products at the grocery store) and amusing details (the stained glass window in the church, and the identity of the 'Best Man' at the wedding).   For me, the game has two flaws to it. The first is that it's fairly short. I finished the main story the same day I bought the game. It does have some replay value through co-op and achievements, but it would have been nice if the game was a bit longer (or had bonus chapters, etc.). The second is that the camera angles get a little awkward. The camera adjusts itself based on where it is you are in a level, but I found it didn't always adjust accordingly if I tried to go back to an area (for example, I tried to go back into the kitchen in the second level once, but the camera refused to move past the doorway, so essentially couldn't go back inside without being completely blind). You can use the WASD keys to alter the camera slightly, but I didn't find this to be very helpful.   Overall, I would recommend the game. Considering how short it is, however, I would recommend getting it while it's on sale instead of paying full price..  Edit: I nominated this game for the Steam awards. Partially because I wanted to give it a shout-out, but mostly because I was too lazy to write a review for any of the other games I nominated.",

            "review_text": "I preface this by saying I was a huge fan of the original game and had loads of fun with its ridiculous gameplay and charm. After having completed the new Octodad, I feel like a few parts of the game design had missteps towards the end of it but it still maintained the fun and silly atmosphere it sprang from. The beginning and middle sections are fantastic. The charm of being a ridiculous octopus trying to pass himself as a human is fun to experience. The game really takes pride in the charm it exudes and rightfully so. The surreality of the entire situation is what makes it amazing. The premise is what sold me on the game originally and it stays fresh up until some bits in the aquarium.   Somehow the aquarium changes the game from being a game about the ridiculous charm of being this octopus man into more of a challenge slog here you find yourself having to master the intentionally awkward controls. I will say as a recommendation, play this game with a controller because, while the game started with only mouse controls, the controller makes it infinitely easier to play. I feel like the challenging bits of it make a little annoying when I don't think it needs to be but there's maybe 4 sections in the whole game where I feel that way so it's not really that detrimental.   It's also nice to see this game explaining the backstory of Octodad, his family, and the chef; at least to an extent. The original just plopped you into this family's life and told you to roll with it while Dadliest Catch gives you a lot of context and I feel that's a nice change but it takes away from the charm somewhat.   The game also has loads of extra stuff you can do after you complete the main game with collectibles and secondary challenges; I personally don't care that much seeing as I was in it specifically for the ridiculous charm but to each his own. There are also few bugs here and there which had me restarting a few checkpoints but they weren't terribly bad. The collision can be a pain for sure though. Ultimately, the game is still very fun and definitely worth a look but it's definitely not for everybody.",

It has a silly but somewhat emotional storyline that really is a lot of fun to play, and is consistantly interesting. Along with that 5 hour story, you have about 30 achievements that make this game even more fun and replayable, and gives the game a good exit.

So far, I have gotten to the aquarium and have spent way more time than I'd like to admit trying to maneuver Octodad up 2 sets of wrong-way escalators. It was amusing for about 5 minutes, then anger and frustration set in. 30 minutes later, I was finally past this, where I promptly quit the game.  If you can handle a game whose main conceit is intentially making you rage with crap controls, and you like the style of humor they provide, then sure: recommended.  To be honest though, I can't recommend this in general - it's too much of a one trick pony for my taste. Buy it for $5 and you'll probably get your money's worth - any more might feel like too much.

So you jump back into Octodad, ready to make it your little ♥♥♥♥♥. And then the cycle repeats itself...with the addition of a few tears and mental breakdowns.  And in your darkest moments of gameplay, when all hope of completing the daunting tasks laid before you seems lost, Octodad's adorable little mustache grabs a hold of the remnants of your soul, and he embraces you with the cold, slimy arms of a man that's unwilling to give up the fight for his family. In that moment, you realize that this little sea creature needs you now more than ever. How could you possibly abandon him?  Now all of this may sound like I'm telling you to stay far, far away from this game, and in all honesty, if you value your sanity, you probably should avoid Octodad. But this is one of the most fun and memorable games I have played in a long time despite the pain and frustration.

Story: 9/10 The story is absurd, and thats just what makes it so good, ok, get this, so this octopus goes on a giant steamboat, rescues this girl named scarlet from a crazy chef (who later becomes the main antagionist.), so they go marry each other and somehow have children, later they go to a aquariuam and get held hostage by the chef, where Octodad must rescue them.  Gameplay: 8/10 The gameplay is extremely addictive and fun, it is wacky, insane, absurd and funny, however, it becomes way to hard to early when you go into the aquariuam, suspiscion also sometimes can come in complete random, in fact doing a simple action such as picking up a mug and dropping it gains you suspiscion.  Controls: 2/10 The controls can be very awkward and sometimes Octodad will grab the wrong them, for example, in the final battle, it is difficult to grab the fishes you need in order to beat the Chef, and Octodad will grab the wrong things at the wrong times, the leg controls however, are acceptable, sure they're not amazing but after playing 2 or 3 levels you can get the hang of it.  Replay value: 10/10 The replay value is amazing, each time you play the game it's still hilarious to see Octodad flailing around admist all the chaos, but the main thing that adds to the replay value are the Ties, collectables that are extremely hard to locate most of the time, and there is of course, the secret level, Toilet &amp; Trouble, which you will probably miss the first time playing the game  Graphics: 10/10 The graphics are cute and cartoony, yet while being easy to recognize at the same time, not much else to say really...  Easter Eggs: 9/10 Oh so many easter eggs, references to so many other things, like Pewdiepie, QWOP, and just so much more, plus as mentioned before, there is a secret level called 'Toilet &amp; Trouble'  Overall score: 48/60 Great, but could do better.",

This is a good thing, though! When you take it easy and focus, (and still look like a goof) making your family burgers or whatever, it's like a silly undercover game.

The joke is that the controls are purposely terrible and it's honest to god hilarious, genuinely so, and even more so in multiplayer where 2 or more people try to control the same sprite.   The multiplayer balance is a little off, one player controls both legs, a 2nd player only gets a single arm to control, without a 3rd player the other arm hangs uselessly. It's kind of a gyp for player 2 not to mention that the arms don't really have much to do in the game anyway. My experence as player 2 still involved lots of laughing and generally a good time but I found myself often wishing I could be useful instead of randomly throwing stuff around and making it harder for player 1 because I was board.   Overall, a great game for couples looking for a good time. Way too short of a story for a single player to get much fun out of but visually clean and diverse game play keep it good throughout. No real re-play value on it's own but I bet the workshop will add some fun that will get me back in later.",

I don't usually criticise games as being 'too short' as I would rather something be short and sweet than to outstay its welcome. With that said, a lot of the fun aspects of this game were less prominent than I would like and I want more. There was also way too much in the way of stealth sections, by which I mean 'more than none'. These sections were not fun at all and they were all clumped together right at the end of the game, making the game leave an overall bad taste with me even though for the majority of the game I was enjoying myself.  tl;dr I recommend this game I guess but only if its a large discount.

            "review_text": "I picked this game up on a whim because I saw it in the featured items section. The odd funny image of an octopus wearing a suit with a family caught my attention. What is this game about? You're just a normal octopus wanting to live the American dream. Having a lovely wife and kids, mowing the lawn, picking up groceries, taking your family to the aquarium, etc. The only problem is that these tasks are incredibly difficult for you to complete (you know, since you're an octopus) so much so that even walking is a challenge. You use your mouse to move the octopus as well as move his hands (press space bar to switch between hands and feet). At first I couldn't help but to laugh at the terrible controls, but that's exactly what makes the game fun. Do note that controlling octodad gets increasingly easier as you play. Reading the reviews from other people on here, the main two negative points I have noticed: *The game is difficult at parts and *There is not enough game for the price.  The game is difficult at parts: Yes the game is difficult in the later missions (particularly the very last mission will have you frustrated). However this doesn't take away from the game at all in my opinion. The sneaking parts as some people had problems with were incredibly easy to get past with little to know thinking. Unless you're a 9 year old who has never before played a video game, you won't have a problem with this.  There is not enough game for the price: The main game is pretty short yes. I beat the main story in roughly 2-1/2 hours. HOWEVER, each level has 3 hidden ties scattered throughout. You can change your tie once you find a new one. After you beat the game you also unlock freeplay mode which allows you to go back and do any level. Let me just say that this game is FUN and I will definitely come back and play it a few times a week. I bought the game for $11.99 on a steam sale. Would I pay $11.99 for it again? Absoultely I would. The game is plain funny. The kind of funny where you just laugh at how silly it is. An octopus struggling to pour a glass of chocolate milk for his (somehow strangely) 100% human daughter...that's just silly! I enjoyed every bit of this game, even the last (insanely difficult mission).",

However, through the humorous controls of the game it is worth noting that the game, like any other, has its flaws. I found using a mouse/keyboard to be particularly challenging to accurately move which caused some collision issues, making my character go through objects and ultimately becoming stuck inside objects. Furthermore, in few scripted scenes my character was caught in some unfortunate locations resulting in a game over. Now these situations are rare and far in-between, so don't expect to share my experiences immediately when you start playing.   Additionally if you feel short-sided by the price and quick story, be patient as this game can be modded by other players.

        {
            "review_text": "To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it made the reviews too long to submit sometimes, I decided to leave it on my Backloggery.  Gameplay: Octodad's main gimmick is the controls, but not in a bad way. You can get used to it pretty quickly, and for those who have played the original freeware Octodad, nothing much has really changed. You control Octodad mainly with the mouse while controlling the camera with WASD. You don't have free range with respect to controlling the camera like you did in the freeware game, but there may be an option that allows you to have full control of the camera somewhere. Nevertheless, the camera angles chosen by the game were plenty good enough for me to do what I had to do.  As you'd expect from the 'full version' of the game, you get to do a lot more within the levels. Some of the jokes like banana peels being infernal hellspawn may be lost on those who haven't played the first game, but they're still a classic slapstick gag. Anyways, the areas within the game encourage some degree of exploration, with the main collectable of the game being ties being hidden throughout most every level. I didn't bother to get all the ties on my first playthrough, but I will do that in the future. There's also a lot more platforming within these levels, although not exactly like the final level from the first game. It's a lot of fun just trying to do simple things like climbing wrong-way escalators and ladders.  That's a lot of the emphasis of the game's design: making simple things very difficult, yet still fun to do. It does succeed in that. Now, the game is rather short; I only spent about two hours just playing through the game at my pace. I'd imagine I could've spent another couple of hours hunting around for ties. Steam Workshop is available for this game, although there isn't too terribly large a swathe of levels available. Nevertheless, it is a very welcome addition. As far as the gameplay goes, if you liked the original Octodad, you'll like this game. If you didn't like the original, you won't like this. If you're not sure or haven't played either, get the original and see how you feel about it. I feel like it's the kind of game that can stay fresh with a yearly playthrough or something. 8/10.  Story: As far as the actual plot goes, subtracting all the humor, it's not bad. It gives a neat little backstory as to how Octodad came to be and it gives a pretty satisfying ending. Add the humor in, and it sure becomes a story (deadpan). You'll definitely get a lot of laughs out of this game. I'm not gonna spoil any of it, but what I can say is that it's like taking a Hannah-Barbara cartoon and adding in liberal amounts of octopus. So if you like that kind of pacing and presentation, you'll get a kick out of this game. 8/10.  Graphics: Yet another thing that fits in with that sorta Hannah-Barbara motif. It's very cartoonish and very nice to look at. All of the areas are very bright and vivid with a great bit of art direction. It's basically the style of the original Octodad kicked up a notch and brought into the current year. Even still, I'd say that this game will still look pretty rad, even in a decade or so. Even the original Octodad still looks pretty good today, and that was a school project. As far as the technical details, I was able to kick it up to 1080p at max settings without any hassle on my GTX 760. It stayed at a very consistent 60FPS, with a couple of lag spots here and there (I'm not really sure why the spots that lagged did so) and ran very cool, topping out with a temperature of 52degC. It looks great and it runs easy on your computer. What more could you want? 5/5.  Sound: Octodad has the best voice actor of all time. Everybody else... well, it doesn't need to be too dramatic. We are talking about something along the lines of a Hannah-Barbara cartoon, after all. Anyways, the sound direction for this game is most certainly comedic and can often times be the main contributor to the humor of the situation. It's definitely a game where playing it without sound would take away a lot of the enjoyment. The music is pretty fun as well, with the main theme being a highlight. Again, the music is decidedly absurd, which is only apropos given the scenario. I'd play the game first, and if you end up digging the soundtrack, I'd pick it up. It's good enough to do that for. 5/5.  Overall scores are: 8/8/5/5; cumulative score of 8.7/10. While it may have been pretty short, what was there was excellent stuff. Again, I'd play the original to see how you feel about buying this. I picked it up on sale ($7.50, I think?), and I feel like I'll get my value out of it from future playthroughs. It's definitely a game that allows for that.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to say 'Yes, I recommend Octodad', but with a few caveats. I think it is something you have to experience (much like its spiritual brothers QWOP, Surgeon Simulator, etc.), yet it goes a little further and I think this does work out as a benefit as much as a flaw.  See, my problem with Octodad is that it can be unfair. Yes, it can be challenging and require you to think, but there are moments (particularly towards the end) where the game can sometimes fail to give you a chance or leaves you hanging. I remember on one of the levels I 'died' as soon as a scene changed because it didn't give me a chance to even really think about moving. The 'puzzle' before the final boss is also infuriating.  But when Octodad is fun, it is FUN. It can be really, really funny to watch him flail and destroy the environment, but the game is littered with in-jokes, references and spoofs, as well as some collectables and other little things to find.  Just... be prepared to throw your controller or tear your hair out.",

I can tell you this, though, this game is pretty hard to master. If you use a track pad PLEASE, I mean PLEASE DO NOT dare play this as you will have longer times than usual completing a single level. Even for people who actually have a mouse, I have concluded that it's difficult. Although once you get the hang of the whole control scheme, you will have a better time playing and more likely a less frustrating experience. That means that you know how to walk at least 2 steps without getting stuck and being able to transition to your arms relatively quick to open something, like a door or a cabinet for instance. If you find yourself getting bored or feeling like you should give up, don't, always be consistent this game takes a lot of hard work, so just maintain consistency.  But the reason why I recommend this game as a 'Yes'... is simply because the game itself is interesting and, of course it's a puzzle game, which is fun for those of you who want to use your brains a lot. This puzzle game involves common sense and it actually tells you objectives as to what you're trying to accomplish. Doing this with friends are more fun, despite that it may take longer, it's pretty comedic probably because of the physics established in the game. When Octodad does an accidental split or turns his body in an awkward position it can be hilarious. Oh I haven't even expressed how fantastic the local coop is, all I'm gonna say about it is it's HILARIOUS, that's pretty straight forward.  For those of you that hate hard games, go play something else, this game is not for you I asure you  You will experience cancer as this game is meant to prevent you from succeding its objectives, that's just my point of view. Impatience is what will cause you to rage quit, just because you completed a level doesn't mean you're going to get through all the other ones at your desired time.",
