    "description": "Build cities, command troops, and manage resources like in a traditional RTS, and also go on quests, chat with your friends, join guilds, and trade like an MMO. SAGA is an MMORTS with battling similar to the Total War series, mixed with city building from Stronghold.",

            "review_text": "When it said Massively Multiplayer. First thing came to mind was one world with everybody on it or 2 or 3 servers. I also thought when it said you can take over territories and expand your empire, meaning you can take take land from other players and expand or invade neutral lands at will. Well I was wrong about all of that. Its mainly single player unless you select war or battle and it will send your army to another players world and do battle there meaning a single raid or just a single battle (PvP match setup). Cant take their land. You cant automatically expand your empire into other lands. you have to do a certain amount of quest just for you to get a mission to take a land just to use it to gather resources. the land is automatically choosen. You dont pick. The graphics are horrible. Fighting scene is primative. just watch your men and the enemy bump each other. Building time is stupid. There isn't life in your city, just staring at buildings. Ghost town. resource gathering takes for ever. The video made the game look interesting but its just not what you expect it to be. Plan on unstalling until they add more features and bring life to our souless town.",

            "review_text": "Lots of the people writing bad reviews are saying untrue stuff. For example, you CAN pvp with your units unlike what x2madda erroneously said. The tournament for tokens/credits are by no means the only pvp mode. There are normal and scrimmage matches where you can use your units. It's also not really that hard to pick up credits. I got about 16 the other day while I was mostly afk-ish working - meaning it really isnt super hard to get free boosters. I am also not sure what the issue was with crashing, but I haven't had that issue on multiple systems. It runs rock solid on windows 7, 8.1 and several linux flavors (mint, arch, steamos, debian). If a game was going to crash, you would think it would be while runing on a non native os...just saying. If I had not tested this game out recently on 9 systems it would seem more plausible. It even ran on a system with a VIA c3 nehemiah cpu as well as newer systems with nvidia optimus.  As far as the army you buy being worthless and not being able to solo with it? Also baloney. I have no problem soloing many of the heroic quests and even the lvl 30+ quests on gold setting (so they are +15 levels in difficulty). I saw the guy in game and I doubt his units were even max level (10), so to make such an absolute statement as was made is a complete fallacy.   If you want a solid, original meat and potatoes gaming experience, you found the right place. Dev team is very responsive and the patches are obviously ongoing.  Saga combines several genres into one game: MMO, Nation Building, and Collectable card games with a generous sprinkling of pvp and non pvp game content.  One further thing I would just like to add: the folks QQing and whaambulancing about the P2W model in Saga seriously need to look at apps like Game of War for context. Saga takes skill to win, you don't win by default just because you spent an insane amount of money on the game. The prices also do not continuously scale up from their original price. Booster packs cost the same. Quests available in game allow players to get cards without paying, as does participation in the tournaments and farming gold lets you buy units as well. Expecting to be able to access mid and end game content a few hours/levels into a game is unrealistic. It would be just like wanting to be max level in any other MMO like warcraft, everquest, guildwars etc within hours and is not realistic.  It may not be for everyone, but I highly recommend it. ",

            "review_text": "It's worth noting Saga is an old MMORTS that originally used a hybrid pay to win concept by allowing you to buy and scan physical cards to unlock new units. These boosters are now wholly virtual, though in theory an old phys booster may still work. The only mechanic to get boosters for free is through the tournament system using random assortments of units. It's semi balanced but it's always possible to get hard countered to all hell.   1. The graphics have not aged well, they were already old fashioned on release but now you could look at any other RTS and have a prettier thing to look at. If you can look past this great, but it's hard imagining spending money on a game when you can just buy a better looking one on steam  2. Behold a Total War ripoff that makes no effort to act like a total war ripoff. Your units are made up of up to 35 cards of the same type, depending on type. Units have absolutely no weight to them, happily pass through enemy units, and be kited easily. Unit's don't engage, they get as close as they can and start attacking. So if you are focusing on one unit the enemy can pull the unit back so that your units just chase them (Kiting) where this would never happen in any other game in this genre; likewise there are no wargame systems like flanking or such going on. All fighting is on a 1v1 basis that makes no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. You CANNOT go into this game expecting a tactical wargame, you'll just get dissapointed. Even that Fantasy War battles thing had more realistic unit fighting, and that game also suffered from overpowered micro.   3. Units are gained through the market or boosters. Boosters must be gained from tournaments or money, and the amount of gold needed to buy from the market makes it impossible to get any units until you already have enough units to progress, You are caught in a catch 22 where you can't progress without new units but you need to progress heavily in order to start being able to afford units. Thus you have to play tournaments, which can take hours to complete for no real payoff. You will frequently run into a longtime player that cheats you by playing the game like a starcraftian RTS where there's no real skill involved besides micromanaging (Which some argue is a talent, but I really don't agree.) Even when you get the points to buy a booster there is no real chance of being able to field a unit since each unit is made up of several cards. The exception being the few and far between solo units  4. Base building falls into the same Catch-22 as above. Resources are most plentiful through fighting, and after awhile you won't have a good enough army to fight for resources until you get a few boosters. The game won't tell you but it's wise to build as many lumber mills as you can and man them, coming back each day to do a few more fights until you can start building other structures. The resource gathering rate is pitiful, you only get a few hundred per day when you can easily get a few hundred from each fight.   Most of these problems could be fixed by simply devoting time and effort into development and balancing. But having played in a few alphas for these developers I know that time and effort is the last thing they are going to invest in. Balacing the resource rates, making it possible to field your factions units without spending a week grinding tournaments , and fixing the weightless combat system are just the tip of the iceburg. What Saga really needs is to die and become Saga 2 with a new engine and motivated dev team.",
