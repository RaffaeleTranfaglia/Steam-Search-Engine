            "review_text": "Firstly, I have a dual degree in archaeology and history, as well as number of years under my belt working in the field as an archaeologist. This game is surprizingly accurate in many respects! It got the mythology right, which you do sometimes tend to see in games set in Egypt ... but more importantly it got the 'everyday life' aspect right (which you NEVER see). The devs really did their research on this game, and it's highly appreciated!! The houses are laid out properly, the material culture is right down to the feathers on the floor and the pottery styles. Even the spells you cast are taken from ancient stories. This makes it one of the only entertainment pieces (games, movies, etc) set in ancient Egypt that has kept me entirely immersed. And I admit I'm hard to please in that aspect - my friends tend to think of me a 'spoil sport' when movies or games 'get things wrong'.  Aside from that, the game is simply a lot of fun. It's challenging WITHOUT PIXEL HUNTING (because, amazingly, I guess people realized that this was possible), but it never had me so stumped that I was pulling my hair out.   All in all I highly recommend this game if you're in to either point and click or puzzles. And if you're not but you like this time era, pick it up anyway. $5 is very worth it. $2 even more so if you get it on sale!   P.S. Also in answer to one of the previous reviews - I don't get seizures, but I do get very frequent migraines. While blurring in other games (and Vsync - I hate Vsync so much, it causes so much ppaaaaiinnnn) do cause issues.... I didn't actually have a problem or notice the blurring in the cut scenes. In terms of migraine sufferers, it should be fine :)  P.P.S. If you're like me and played Egypt 1156 b.c. Tomb of the Pharaoh as a kid ... just buy this and try it out. The nostalgia is intoxicating. :D",

            "review_text": "Got this game as part of an Adventure bundle. To start with had the screen flicker others on Win 7 have mentioned but an Nvidia update actually sorted out. Found the movement a little disorientating at times. Terrible script, terribly acted. There is information available in the game about Egyptian gods, religion, myths and magic but I'm not that interested in Egyptian history. Decided I didn't care whether the pharoah died or not.....gave up. Even if you love both all things pyramid shaped and adventure games think very carefully before getting this.",

            "review_text": "I was unsure at first but I got it while it was on sale, and to be honest, it's looking like a magical advanture so far. The puzzles are hard and it's a bit hannoying to get used to it, but it's worth it- a very intersting and somewhat different (in a good way) Click and point game. I say go for it, if you are into old yet special games that requires much observe into the little details.",
