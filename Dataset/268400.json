Two big ones: the price and a lack of polish. The price speaks for itself. As far as the lack of polish goes, there's an unforgiveable absence of multiplayer features. No leaderboard, not even a way to track your win/loss ratio. The menus are cluttered, unorganized and rather ugly. No Steam workshop support. The game is practically screaming for these features but it seems that the developers have turned a def ear. Perhaps they feel the game has enough content, and maybe they're right, but for the price they're asking, one would expect a more complete experience.  A game anyone would certainly enjoy, but in it's current state, I can only recommend it when it's on sale...  9/10",

            "review_text": "This is the best tactical-level war game of all time. Its roots reach all the way into the 70's and AH's entry into the wargaming world, and has preserved all that is good and playable in a turn-based WWII game. The Best. Ever. The DLCs work flawlessly, and each one adds significant depth to the games and dozens of hours of enjoyment. The 128 hours I've played so far are just on Steam; I've owned this game since it was first announced, and I've owned all the games it is based upon, all the way back to AH's Blitzkreig.  I really can't say a single bad word about this game, as for me it is perfection (well, if it made breakfast that'd be great too.) It is not for the FPS guys or the RTS guys; however, if you can slow down and learn to enjoy a games depth and thoughtfulness and comprehensive presentations of conventional warfare in the 20th century, you will learn to love this game series. The controls are elegant, the options are varied and make for an excellent adjustment to give you just the gaming experience you desire. The entire game can be played with just your mouse, although you can set and modify many keymaps. The game contains a wealth of historical and technical data and will allow the user to satifactorily recreate any time periond, battle sequence, or campaign from this massively important time in human history. The map has two levels of zoom and a strategic view as well, easily shifted between ground and air units, which is all the divisions you need to play this game seamlessly. This can be a casual, quick scenario game, or a deep and long-lsting campaign with units developing heroes, increased combat strengths, and upgrades. Most all military units are represented, easily identifiable, and movement and combat are simple click/click movements. It has a nice musical background and great yet simple audio battle sounds. You can save at any time, you can review a battlefield after conclusion, and it has more than adequate support for most all resolutions. It is not a computer hog for resources, and can run on older or less robust systems than most games. I've never really had a technical issue, other than it getting a little sloggy after playing for 8 hours or so, and a simple save/restart cleared that up. With the release of the Soviet campaigns/scenarios, I can't wait to experience them from the Russian perspective; I will add to the review when I've played it a lot. In case you glossed over it, this is the BEST turn-based WAR GAME EVER. Replayability is infinite, as is the enjoyment. It is not for every single person on the planet, but only for the intelligent, patient players who enjoy a brilliant design and a flawless execution of an elegantly simple, yet deep combat system. Forget to combine your arms in the proper order, and an easy victory will turn on it and defeat you. It can be played solo, hot-seat (both players in the room but each player only sits at the PC when it's their turn, or multiplayer and PBEM.  PERFECT. I cannot imagine recommending a game more enthusiastically than I recommend this one.",

After that I bought the expansions both never really got to play them since I had spent many hundred hours (not on the Steam version - only bought that a year ago approximately) and got a little tired of the game, I guess.  However, I have played the multiplayer (PBEM) part of the game for many hundred hours too, with a specific opponent. That has been the BEST part of the experience. After we ran out of multiplayer scenarios after about 4 years or something, we began downloading custom scenarios. I can easily recommend '1941' that is a 99 turn game that spans 1941 to 1945.   So all in all I can EASILY recommend it.  However, I would LOVE a Campain based multiplayer where you can battle your opponent in a balanced way (maybe that is a whole different way - I got many ideas for how to do that...",

Best games I played as a teenager and young adult. Now Panzer Corps recreates all the fun and adds lots more in the east and west grand campaign DLC's, events and my favourite Afrika corps.  It looks good, plays comfortably and is a thinking man's game. Just don't expect a FPS experience or such or over the top graphics. I've been playing Panzer Corps from the release, now 3 years ago. And all stand alones and DLC's.  Still playing and still having fun.   When writing this there's a sale on, but even at full price it's worth it every cent. All complainers about the supposed 'high' price don't appreciate the 'easy to learn, hard to master' approach of Panzer Corps, or realise the immense replayability of the game.

Like many other reviewers, I was a big fan of Panzer General and the Steel Thunder games back in the stone age. On the surface, Panzer Corps seems like a pretty straightforward reboot of those titles. It has a lot more depth, though. The game seems insanely easy to play at first--the interface is as straightforward and clear as anything. There are definitely right and wrong ways to do things, though. It's rewarding to find out that Panzer Corps responds in the ways you expect it to, though--if you have a reasonable grasp of what the different unit types are supposed to do, it's fun to discover that your dreams of being an armchair Rommel actually work out.  There's a huge variety of unit types, and it's really fun to build up the core of your army throughout a campaign. You really start to care about your units. In one campaign I was invading Sicily and feeling way too confident...I let my prized British commando unit (elites that couldn't be replaced) get chewed up by the Germans when I got cocky. It was one of those slo-mo 'no no no nonooooooooooooooo' moments, hehe.  Oh, and after a bad day at work and/or with the gf/wife/whatever you've got, PC has the perfect solution to your problems. Start a Wehrmacht '39 campaign on the easiest setting, and just roflstomp your way through the baby seals.  Great game. Totally addictive. Get it.",
