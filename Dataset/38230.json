The HD update has rendered the game completely unplayable as the main screen turns into a bizarre white glow so that nothing is visible. Such a shame as this game is so much fun.   Seeing as this has been the case now for nearly 6 months (since the HD update) and the developers have done NOTHING to rectify the situation, I am not holding my breath for a fix anytime soon.  Stay away.",
