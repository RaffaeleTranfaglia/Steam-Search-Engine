The Antidote system really makes the difference, keeping you tense all the time, adding a lot to the sneaking and exploration. Also the story is quite interesting, with a few positively 'WTF?!' moments which will stay with me for quite some time.   Also this games gives a lot of scares and intense moments with dense atmosphere, with nearly no jumpscares! A rarity these days in Horrors! :D  If you're into horrors or just want to play something unusual and interesting - don't hesitate to give it a go, and you won't regret it.",

I don't know what this games has, but it's like whole new level of horror. I will not forget this game for a long time. That is a horror I am certain I will not forget for a long time.",
