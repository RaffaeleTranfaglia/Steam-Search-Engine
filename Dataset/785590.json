    "recommended_requirements": "OS: Windows 10 Processor: 4 Cores and up Memory: 8 GB RAM Graphics: Almost any card released in the last 3-4 years that supports DX10 and Shader Model 4.0 DirectX: Version 10 Storage: 150 MB available space Sound Card: I don't think I've had a dedicated sound card in a computer in the last 10 years. So... anything? I guess? Anything that makes sounds? Additional Notes: The game was built and tested mostly on a Windows 10 PC with an Intel i5-4690k 3.5GHZ CPU and a Nvidia GTX 980 (which is overkill) and no dedicated sound card. It also doesn't have any fancy light mods in the tower but the keyboard is mechanical which makes me happy while typing. Also a wired mouse because I never have batteries.",
