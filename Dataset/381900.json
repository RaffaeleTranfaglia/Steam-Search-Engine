            "review_text": "My recommendation is somewhat reserved. While the game is enjoyable and has a few flaws. The biggest is how dying appears to remove all your powerups. Only after playing for a while do you realize certain items block this, and you don't actually lose everything. Still, even with a bubble around you there are still plenty of instant deaths it seems.  The game is rather short once you get the hang of it. There is no reason to use a weapon other than the knife, and the game is completeable with very few of the 'death' upgrades. The bosses are zero challenge if you arrive at them with a 3-knife fully powered up.  I like the secrets, including assembling the map. There does feel like something is a bit off though; on the first level if you find all the secrets you get a bonus heart. This doesn't appear to repeat on any other level of the game.  The hit-boxes of the monsters (for character contact) are unforuntately quite generous. Quite often I died without any visible pixels actually touching each other.",

I've now played this for 3 hours and I love the simplicity; a monster touches you, you're dead. You touch spikes, you're dead. Collect gems, buy better armor/weapons and die right away, losing everything. I love this sh*t.",
