            "review_text": "Scribblenauts at its best! While Unlimited was good, it ended fairly quickly, and then there was not much else to do other than use the backgrounds and spawn things randomly.  Here there is dynamically randomly generated content that goes on endlessly, every time you reload a level there's more things to do, even with variances with the dynamically generated content, the quest giver/target as well as the things being asked change even within the same quest.  And to top it all THE MASSIVE ADDITION OF THE DC UNIVERSE!!! All of this together makes for the best Scribblenauts experience I've ever had! 10/10.",

At eight years old my son (not my mental age, just to be clear) has already had hours of enjoyment playing the first Scribblenauts but with his love of super heroes, in particular DC ones, this game has taken things to a whole new level. I'm loving seeing this game help with his reading, typing, spelling as well as his mouse and keyboard skills. We have a rule that if he is playing then he has to think things through and also try to enter the names of items and characters - and it works! Of course I'm also getting a kick of out any hearing the weird or wacky ideas he comes up with that solve the puzzle (as well as dropping a few of my own) and there have been times when we have both laughed quite freely while playing.  And yes, I've had a blast playing on the game myself. For obvious reasons this is less likely to appeal to someone without kids and I much prefer playing the game with the young'n but I would not say it cannot be enjoyed by any age group. The difference in enjoyment is just expressed in the ways you play and hell, for under £4 who wouldn't want to trample over Sinestro on a giant rhino riding Cthulu or defeat Lex Luthor by striking him with an invisible singing fish?",

This game expands that by adding many villians to fight and heroes to help you, all from DC comics. It also makes it a much bigger part of the game by directing you to do it more. Maxwell takes on the role of a superhero, thus having to frequently fight. That's what was so fun to me about this game. I also enjoyed having DC characters in the game.  One complaint I have though is that the missions can sometimes repeat themselves. The reason is that Unlimited had a lot of programmed tasks, each unique, but Unmasked generates a set of missions randomly upon entering an area.  Also, the game is quite expensive for a Steam game, so it may be a good idea to wait for a sale. Given that it's relatiively casual and quite short, (It takes around 10 hours to get every acheivement) that is what I reccommend doing.",

When Doppleganger and Cheetah Lady were to be teleported out nothing happened and controls were still locked for the cutscene. I tried this multiple times and still could not get the game to proceed ergo making it impossible to finish the game.  I was looking foreward to playing this game for a long time so I'm very disappointed. While a compatability issue is possible, if it can happen to me it can happen to others.  In short, buy at your own risk.  UPDATE/WARNING: Do not use a custom avatar before completing the main storyline. I think it may have had something to do with using a custom avatar before completing the main storyline as the problem started soon after creating one. I cleared all the data and was able to finish the game after doing so. Still, it shouldn't have happned in the first place.  With that aside I'll say it's a decent game otherwise.",

The characterisation of the DC roster is generally solid, if understandably 2D. It feels like the kind of simplicistic presentation that comes from love of the source material. In that sense, it could be seen as a less successful cousin to the LEGO games. The interface doesn't particularly lend itself to a PC, clearly being designed with a touchscreen in mind, but this only creates the smallest of irritations. The game is suitably slow-paced, so it never becomes genuinely problematic. A fun game, if lacking in depth.",

However, it's also fairly decent as a DC game, if you're into that kind of game. It has qutie a collection of available DC characters, pretty much any one you can think of. Even down to specific incarnations of the character. And if there's a character you want that isn't in the game, well...make it yourself. Or see if somebody else has. The game has workshop support, after all. The story's not exactly the best story that's ever been wrote, but, it is super-hero game directed at kids. I'd reccomend giving it a try if you like DC games and creating your own things. Though, after a while, the game DOES start to feel kind of...stale. Everything begins to become 'Been there, done that.'",

The only thing different this time is story line now includes super-heroes.  You can 'draw' your favorite heroes and have them join in on the action whenever you want. Each hero has multiple different costumes from their own comics which adds to the variety in the gameplay.  I couldn't quite get into this game very easily however, the story seemed very bland and not interesting. The side quests which were available were also all very samey. I suppose I am probably in the wrong age bracket for this sort of game, the younger audience may appreciate this more.  The graphics keep to the same colorful playful style as with the other games in the series. Plenty of customization is available through creating your own heroes and sharing them through Steam Works.  If you are a fan of the series or want to try something a little bit quirky and different, definitely check this out. However at full price, I wouldn't purchase this title, Scribblenauts Unlimited is for sure the better of the two on Steam.",
