    "description": "Shmup Moments is a shoot-'em-up game that's easy to pick up and play. With arcade-like gameplay, slick controls and sound, hot beats and lighting, and a classic bullet hell ambience, it's the perfect game to chill out with when you need a break from AAA titles, or to meditate with before going to bed.",
