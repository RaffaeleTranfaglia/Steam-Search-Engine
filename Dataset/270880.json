            "review_text": "I'm going to be completely honest. I don't know a lot about trucks, or about trucker life, or about running a trucking business. But American Truck Simulator still appeals to me. Driving along a highway making a delivery while listening to some music, listening to a podcast or watching a twitch stream/youtube video is very satisfying and relaxing, however its debatable if what is available here is worth the price(I'll argue both points of view)  You're given 2 states, and 2 types of trucks at launch. Thats all you get. Granted, more will be available down the line, at launch its a very small pick. You're going to see the same landmarks several times just by playing about as much as I have(A little over 6 hours at this point). You're also going to be doing a lot of the same thing, especially if you don't get a loan early on and just do Quick Jobs like I've been doing. However, if the gameplay thats given is satisfactory enough, I could forgive it, which is is in my opinion.  However, if you've played a lot of Euro Truck Simulator 2, I would recommend you wait on this. There isn't much of a change at all, its basically a well made expansion pack to ETS 2. If you're looking for more of that gameplay with a new environment, $20 might be a fair enough price, but if you're on the fence, wait. I'm sure it'll be on sale a few months down the line, and I'm sure they'll be more content at that point. But I do think its worth the $20 purchase is worth it if you haven't played Euro Truck Simulator before.  The gameplay is nice and relaxing with some light management gameplay tacked on for good measure. Its absolutely worth $20 for me, but I think most people will want to wait.     Wait For A Sale    ",

These days you have all these racing games coming out (Need For Speed 2015, Forza 6, Project Cars), that everybody gets wrapped up in the fast paced, runaround games that require as much skill as a real racing driver. However, this game changes the entire scene of driving games. For one, it is a very relaxing games. Sometimes the traffic will get in the way, but other than that its very calming. It also completly changes the map for simulation games. When I first heard of ETS2, I thought it was a crappy knockoff. Until a buddy of mine, who hates driving games, recommended it to me. I checked it out and now I have nearly 70 hours of gametime on it. Ive only had ATS for a few months now, and I almost have the same amount.   tl;dr game is good, get it, even if you dont like racing games you can just chill.   420/69",

Game is impressive indeed, from graphic, sound to gameplay, everything is in it's place! And beside all of that it is very well optimised that low/medium PC specs can run it on ultra settings. I can't write of actual gameplay impressions at this time because of limmited content, therefore I will edit that part on later date. BUT I know I will very much enjoy it, heck I even do now just looking at game beautiful landscape, npc's living their lifes, listening to powerful engine sound....just great!   PRO's:  +Can cause addiction;   known symptoms; bad smell, pain in back, often sleepy, angry family members,  prevention; take often walks on fresh air, bath at least once a day, eat,drink and go to toilet regulary   +Beautiful graphic textures and models  You know I was a truck driver for 7 years, no BS, and only way I can get back to trucking is in SCS games.   +Fun and easy to start it if you are new in this type of games (but you aren't ^^)  If you somehow manage to roll this over 2000-3000 hours of play-time you will probably know why I quit that job xD     CON's:  /none/    Note:  Even with updates coming soon, my opinion is that it was better to delay release for a bit until more content is in the game.   Now I suggest you all BUY this game, try it a bit, and live your lifes until update comes.",

Modders have already had their way and sometimes made some nice things, but nothing close to ETS2 yet (which is logical).  This will be a great game, it just might be expensive to see it.  bought on sale with a coupon, paid $16 and it was worth it.  7/10.",

Everything that was in the European version is here, so if you've played ETS before, you'll have no problem skipping all of the tutorials and jumping straight into the game. They added a couple of new features, like choosing your parking difficulty and weigh stations and the lanscapes look exactly like their real life counterparts. They really did their homework in that regard. However, the game was still extremely disappointing. For one, there were only 2 playable states on launch: California and Nevada. This means completing the game is a lot easier and routes tend to be much shorter. I wouldn't mind too much, if it didn't mean traveling on the same highways over and over again because the longest routs usually take you to the same places. The game also only launched with only two trucks too, which is weird because I thought this was called American TRUCK Simulator. I know the lack of trucks was because of licensing issues and they'll be adding more trucks and states later (I believe they already added another truck in an update), but it was still disappointing to see this go a similar route of Sims 4 (a new installation in a franchise with less content than its predecessors). Don't get me wrong though, I still really enjoy what the game had going for it so far, and I've logged quite a few hours into the game already, however, I can't recommend buying it right now since there's not much in it yet. Wait until they add more content, then I really recommend buying it.",

I will always love these guys.  The graphics are not changed, the physics has not changed, the menu has not changed, visual damage trucks do not appear. This is a new game in 2016? 2 trucks, essentially the same state and 2, you serious?  for 2 years of developing I expected more than just 2 states and 2 trucks, shame on you SCS.   Unfortunately this game has a rushed feeling. Its like that half of cheese burger your room-mate left in the back of the fridge. you know you wanna eat it, but a fresh warm cheese burger is so much better.  There are 50 States in USA, great truck history. In American Truck simulator we have just two states ( 4% of USA map ) and  TWO trucks . Omg. when I started game first time I felt like I playing demo version. But dont worry , DLC map coming soon! just 10€ each.   Game is not wroth money at the moment. You should wait for dlc maps and buy complete version later.  3/10",

Takes no time at all to go from point A - point B, The Traffic is even more stupid as I was 1/2 way through a yellow light, Going slow as I was pulling out from a stop a few car back at a red light and a car drove right in the side of my truck. The Rest stop's are dirt fields by the side of the road. Got to love 5000 cop cars on the road also. I drive the speed limit but come on at one point it seemed like more cop cars then normal traffic was on the road along with 1 parked off to the side as a speed trap.  I am all for supporting a game but this is not even close to finished.   Save your money people and buy ETS-2 its a way better game overall. The Trucks even feel like they are on ice in ATS vs ETS-2  At first I gave this a thumbs up but after playing it for a bit I would say save the money and wait for a steam sale in a few months or buy ETS-2 as its much better overall. They failed bringing this out too soon, should have waited and got it right the first time. Not fix it as we go along.  Man it killed me to say dont buy this game as I was so looking forward to it. I dont hate Trucks sims. Look at my ETS-2 hrs played as proof. Just dont touch this yet it need a bunch of work before its ready.",

            "review_text": "To be clear this isn't a bad game however when compared with Euro Truck sim 2 it’s hard to recommend this game over it. If you’re an American this may be different but the appeal to me is to drive around with my truck following the laws of the road and enjoying myself. I know that many people won’t enjoy this style of game, but then again I don’t enjoy Fifa (other football and sport games are available).   The game looks much better than European truck simulator the cities and even down to small details such as cracks in the road. At the end of a job the parking process is much better as you get to choose how you want to park selecting from what is effectively; hard, medium and don’t park. The increase in fuel stations is good as in euro truck you could only buy fuel in a city if you had a garage upgraded. The coast roads look absolutely incredible (but with faster trucks in euro truck would be more fun there).   I know more trucks and roads are coming but I find myself thinking why don’t I just play euro truck instead? The current engines available are low on power and the GPS likes taking you down extremely small roads. Also The game makes the ‘highways’ have more bends in them than the motorways in Britain and Europe. The police surprise attack you every moment you are speeding and they are very sneaky arriving just after a 30 sign that I happen to miss seeing. When you finally crawl up to speed on a ‘highway’ you are forced to slow down as the road just arrives in a city or town that you have no idea about until you either get fined for speeding or crash into cars waiting for traffic lights!!!   In conclusion although American truck Simulator is a good simulator I still feel like Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a better game. On euro truck I have put in 110+ hours (had none steam version for a while) and I have experienced that game to about the full whereas American truck simulator I only have about 3 hours of which I know isn’t a lot but still it is difficult for me to recommend.   So in it's current state I cannot recommend this game, with more trucks and roads in future this may alter my view.  *Disclaimer* I know more trucks and roads are coming and I know that you can get mods for removing the police and increasing engine sizes but I wanted to play this game properly but despite this I wasn’t levelling up very quickly and I wanted to see what truck options were available so I had to use an XP cheat mod so I could see the options.  Edit: The traffic light situation was improved but the game still isn't as good as ETS2",

Which is good news since before it felt too small. i would say now it feels right! Trips from northern california to the arizona south take easily over an hour. The controles are Perfect, i play with keyboard and still, it is very playable. If you have more precise input, thats easily more fun. Sound is great, Graphics are VERY nice except the trees and bushes look a bit 'bitmappy' I have pranked several of my friends uploading a nightly video of a short ride and some still think that my parttime job is a trucker.  The negatives are that there is not much happening. I hoped for some Smokey and the Bandit type of missions, Traffic Jams, Police actually stopping you...inspecting cargo etc... eating would also be fine. Maybe have a nice truckerbar where truckers could gamble and play cards. CB Radio warning for Radartraps and such. It feels a little sterile. But if you just want trucking and have nice scenes during your trucking...well you should really buy it. Its worth it. If you like podcasts...HELL its even better.",

The main thing that brought me to that conclusion was the scale in the game. A mile in game is equivalent to about 100 feet on the road,which makes a 100+ mile drive take about 10 minutes. Why does that drive of 100 miles (about 2 miles in real scale) take that long? Because the trucks are the most sluggish and poor handling things I've ever seen in a game like this. Having the petal matted to the floor and flat-foot shifting takes about 1 whole minute to get to 50mph. I can't recommend this game in this state.",

            "review_text": "PROS: - Massive cities compared to Euro Truck; took me about 5-10 minutes to simply get out of Los Angeles. Not complex road systems like GTA, but large areas of city scenery - Police patrols instead of traffic cams. If a police car sees you speeding, you hear sirens and they flash their lights, and you get a ticket. - Finally, since it is North American road rules, we can turn right at a red light and not get penalized for it! - Weight stations add a little immersion, don't know what affect they have on gameplay at this time however - Truck interiors seem much more realistic now, may be just because they are familiar interiors with analog gauges. - New trailer delivery system - you can choose at the gate to a) Auto-park the trailer b) Park the trailer in an easy spot c) Park the trailer in a difficult but percise spot, all with different XP bonuses  CONS: - Very few truck brands, and therefore probably fewer models - Much smaller map than Euro Truck at this time, only includes 3 states (Nevada, California, &amp; Arizona). I'm assuming they plan to expand on that. - UI, main menu, sound effects, and in-game HUD are all direct copies from Euro Truck - no originality. - American trucks with the extended front (rather than the flat, rectangular shaped trucks) are much harder to drive at high speeds, takes longer to get from point A to point B, especially on twisted off-roads. - Very unpopular with multiplayer mod, no more than 100 people on at a time on NA or EU servers, as opposed to 2400 on ETS2.  OTHER POINTS: - Already tons of mods out for the game, including trucks, trailers, graphics, gameplay, and more. - swood american music  My opinion: Gameplay 2.5/5 Level Design: 4/5 Bug-free: 5/5 Total: 3.5/5  American Truck Simulator is to Euro Truck, as Civ: Beyond Earth is to Civ V.

            "review_text": "First off let me start by saying that I love the concept and I really liked Euro Trucker 2.. I've been waiting a long time for the American version because.. well I live in America. The game its self is basically the same thing as Euro Trucker 2 which is perfectly fine (read reviews about the Euro version for in-depth info) but there are 2 things that cause me to down vote the American version of the game:  1. Why start on the west coast for the first release? That's about as far as you can get from what real trucking is like in the US. California is a bunch of tree hugging hippies, massive conjestion, liberal regulations that making trucking there a joke. You can't even drive classic trucks in that state because of their insane laws so why choose that to start off in? I would have much rather have seen the midwest, south, even the east coast for the first version. I've driven all over the US and California is about the last state I would have stated with.  2. The 1st one was more of me ♥♥♥♥♥ing, this one though is really why I downvote the game. The developer made the decision to change the scale of the game in the American version which blows my mind. I can't understand why they would do this as logically it makes no sense. In the Euro version when you drive from country to country it feels like you are long hauling.. I'm not saying that I spend hours in front of the computer for 1 route but you do get the experience that you really are trucking. In the American version when you drive from LA to San Deigo you can barley get the truck up to speed before you arrive at your destination.. to be honest it's really bizzare.  It seems to me that the developers think that the 'fun' in this game is backing up the truck to unload and going from stop light to stop light when you arrive at a town.. and that's not the case at all. The real fun in this game is being on the open road, having your radio tuned to some red neck station and chilling out drinking a beer trucking down the high way... that's what it's all about. The Euro version had this, the American version doesn't come close.  The scale change for America was a big let down, yes I know that if they kept the same scale that they had in the Euro version that it may have taken a few hours to drive from the west coast to the coast.. but honestly that's not a bad thing. People who are crazy enough to do that, more power to them... that's long hauling in America and trust me there is plenty to see that would have justified the content being created (DLC, more money for them). As it stands now I think the developer missed a huge oppurtunity to take advantage of the US market but not understanding it's love for driving and the potential revenue that could have been captialized on.",

            "review_text": "I guess it's time for my review!   Stability / Polishing / Performance: The game is not crazily polished, but it works well and has no major bugs as far as I was able to tell. It's performance is compared to other games rather underwhelming, but it should work on most systems.   Graphics: The graphics aren't all that great. The texture resolution is good, the overall quality of the textures is also fine. But when it comes to complex lighting effects the game doesn't necessarily match today's industry standards. However it doesn't look 'ugly'.  Gameplay: The game is very detailed when it comes to the controls. The physics aren't so bad given it's not aiming for damage models or any fancy stuff. It shows it's muscles when it comes to simulating a lively AI driven traffic world. Eventhough the AI sometimes acts outrageously stupid, there are few games one could compare this game with, but I'd dare to say the AI here is still the smartest, given that (nearly) no other game tries to accurately simulate normal every-day traffic! (even GTA with a much higher budget has NPCs blowing each other up just by accident - this doen't happen here)  The game also has a little background simulation going on for the player's company, which I'd like to recommend to focus on in later titles, since it shows some potential in my opinion.   Models / Game World: The truck models are very detailed and look nicely, if you don't look too closely at the big headlights you can mount at the bumper and the roof of your truck (those have just a plain texture). The AI cars don't look too shabby either.  The game world itself is a little lack-luster. Eventhough they made great improvements compared to the previous title, it's still partially in medieval-ages of game development with sprite-based distant flora and some simplistic general design. Cities don't consist of much more than a few steets.    However I believe the game has something to it. You could consider it to be one of those 'zen' games that you can just use to relax while playing. It has a progress system, a (downloadable) multiplayer and steam workshop support, which already addresses a whole bunch of the previous critique and if you feel adventurous, you should look around on the internet, there are plenty more other mods that address even more things of the game - I believe there's even one or two complete game world replacers and add-ons out there.",

Or you can just buy a truck for yourself, not hire anyone and cruise the USA (well...CA, NV and AZ) as an independent owner-operator. Works best with a wheel of course, but perfectly manageable with a gamepad. There's a ton of options to set so you can make the game as realistic as you wish. Can't manage or don't want bothered backing a 53' trailer into a tight spot? Turn it off. Realistic air brakes to real? Turn it off, you get the idea.

This leads me to believe that the one being taken away broke down and they urgently needed a replacement to continue the construction.  It's the little things that make this game so great, and make it so much different than ETS 2. Yes, there are only 2 states. Yes, there are only 2 trucks (that can be customized to make it more like 4 or more trucks in my opinion). More of both of those are to come in future updates. What is in the game right now is definitely worth $20. In fact, I think it's underpriced, especially considering that the price includes years of updates (ETS 2 released in 2012 and is  still being updated  - even after ATS is released!).   There will be paid DLC for some of the states, simply because of the amount of work that has to be put into each one. SCS Software has to make money somehow, and they definitely deserve it.  Also, if there really is not enough content for you, then there are always mods. The game just released days ago and there are already quite a few free mods to enhance your game.  Edit: Let me add something else -  The game is supposed to look and play like ETS 2 . It is not a successor or sequel. It is the same game in America. Both games will still be updated, and each will benefit from the other. If you bought the game expecting any different, then perhaps you should have done your research first, since this has always been the case since they first announced ATS. What is different, like I said, is the little things. The world feels much more alive, and you do actually feel like you have a purpose other than 'drive from this warehouse to that one.'",

        {
            "review_text": "You are a truck driver. Your goal is to build your trucking empire, one job at a time. Beginning the game, you'll be introduced to a simple delivery job that explains the controls and acts as a tutorial. Afterwards, you'll be dumped at your garage, tasking with saving up enough money to buy your own truck by doing work for other companies. Eventually, you'll be able to buy your own truck, and gain access to the Freight Market, which pays more than the Quick Jobs from contractors. However, you'll have to pay for your own expenses: damages, fuel, fines, and more.   The graphical design of American Truck Simulator echoes the games of its past. While it does attempt to stay current with visual effects like lens flares, godrays and more, ultimately the game's graphics won't impress anybody. The truck models are highly-detailed, and leave little to be desired, but the textures throughout the world are often muddy, low resolution, and can be a bit of an eyesore up close. However, once you're out on the open highway, it's easy to find yourself getting lost in the long winding road ahead of you, with only subtle mountains in the background as a backdrop. The sun beats down on the hot tar below your tires, and it shines up in your face, effectively blinding you if you look just the wrong way.    These graphics, however, are a double-edged sword. While the game does by no means look great, this also allows for lower-end hardware to play the game, and play it well to boot. The game is not very demanding, and even lower-end configurations will not struggle to drive the game. On an NVIDIA GTX 970, paired with an Intel i7-5820k, I averaged 110fps throughout my gameplay. This is with everything maxed, and 400% scaling.    The trucks look good, the backdrops hold up well, but the ground textures, building textures, and AI vehicles look lackluster for a game released in 2016. When put alongside another brand new release, like Rise of the Tomb Raider, you can clearly see that SCS Software was not out to achieve the best in graphical capabilities.  American Truck Simulator is, at its heart, a simulation game. As such, it does this very, very well. Bar-none, it is the most realistic driving game available on PC, and likely available, period. That being said, the engine used in this game is the exact same engine in SCS Software's previous installment, Euro Truck Simulator 2.This means that while the simulation in this game is excellent, it's no better than the game before it. Granted, there's little room for improvement in the game, so I see no reason to fix what isn't broken here.    Immediately starting the game, you'll find yourself dropped into a truck. On-screen prompts will walk you through the basics of the interface, and then you'll be on your way. This game has excellent gamepad and wheel support, and they should be a breeze to set up if you prefer it over kb+m. Once you're all set up, it's time to hit the road. You'll immediately notice how much weight you feel in your truck. The steering is heavy, the acceleration is a game of patience, and the laws of the road are ever-present, adding another layer of pressure while you're getting accustomed to your new big rig.    Jobs will require you to take a trailer of contents from one location to the next, and your SatNav will indicate your route. This will be your guardian angel as you trek across the land. Below your SatNav, your miles-to-go is displayed, letting you know how much longer you have left in your drive. You'll need to be particularly mindful of your fuel, and your consciousness. As you drive, these two will drain. If you become too tired, you'll drift in and out of consciousness, and eventually pass out at the wheel, racking up fines as you drive while exhausted. If you run out of fuel, you'll find yourself dead in the water in the middle of the road, with your only option being to pay for a tow truck to the nearest rest stop. The world of American Truck Simulator boasts a plethora of winding roads, hills and dusty back roads to drive across. Each offers a distinct style of gameplay while you head towards your destination.   American Truck Simulator™ is a fun game, hindered by a lack of content. While SCS Software plans to release additional trucks and states, in its current state, the game offers little more than a re-skin of its predecessor set in a not-so-interesting location. Fans of the previous game will definitely find many hours of enjoyment, but newcomers are definitely encouraged to look toward the previous title for their first foray into the truck simulation world. Small UI and gameplay improvements are a welcome addition, but it doesn't change enough to make it feel like a new game. With that said, however, it is priced competitively and fairly, and finds itself costing little more than the Scandinavia DLC for the previous game in the series.",

Personally, I somehow find that American important locations in towns and cities, as depicted in the game, are spread too far apart. You can drive a couple of minutes to get to the company you want to take a job for, or to get to a service centre to get your truck repaired/upgraded. This eats into you 'awake time' in the game, and you start yawning very quickly (to me) while on the road.  Plus, rest stops seem to be rather scarce in America when compared to Europe. Good thing is, you don't get fined for not sleeping. Speed limit signs are almost non-existent. Woe be to you if you were in the process of slowing down from 70 to 30 when approaching a city, and a cop car happens to pass you - you get fined.....EVEN WHEN YOU'RE SLOWING DOWN.

Sure, the scale is sort of small, and yes there isn't nearly as many roads as ETS2, but the cities and enviroment, and just level of detail make up for it.   Don't get me wrong, American Truck Simulator is the same game as Euro Truck Simulator 2. It's a different map, different trucks, but the game is the same. However, in saying that, I feel American Truck Simulator is funner to play personally, and I haven't touched ETS2 since.  You actually feel as if you ware driving through actual cities. The enviroments, I've driven down the same road 10 times, and still notice something new. American Trucks, in my opinion, are much funner to drive. While the map does skip some accuracy, it still feel similar. Driving through California feels like driving through California. I am a really happy camper, and plan on purchasing upcoming Map DLC to support these devs.  FOR YOU LINUX USERS: I fully converted to Linux full time (no dual boot) in September 2015, and I must say, the Linux Version is remarkable. I have a GTX 980 and use Nvidia Proprietary Drivers (keep that in mind) and the performance is on par with the Windows Version. I even use a Logitech G27. No issues whatsoever. I'd give the SCS team a high five for this. Remarkable.  My ONLY Complaint about this game, is still the lack of Force Feedback on Logitech G27 (and other wheels) under Linux. It's purely a Game Issue, as the Linux Beta for ETS2 had Force Feeback, then it was removed and never fixed. Force Feedback works flawlessly on every other game. If they would fix this, I would be so so grateful.",

SCS have already stated that new maps will follow &amp; for now they are free.  There are a few on going licencing issue's both with city names &amp; Truck makes. SCS have a well proven record of bringing knew trucks to their games free as they gain the rights to use the name's.  Though I am not sure about just how much of the map content will be free , &amp; in that respect it could be like its older brother ETS2 where some of the maps were pay for DLC at a good price.  SCS support is one of the best out there &amp; as been since day one.  I am sure this game will grow in very much the same way ETS 2 as over its life time.  I most respects ATS as improved over ETS 2 both looks wise &amp; playing wise .  I agree that the time scaling needs tweaking to give a better feeling for the scale of driving in the USA.  The weather looks better than ETS 2 the detail looks better even if its based in a very dry part of the USA .  The two truck look good drive ok after spend year playing ETS 2 driving these bigger long trucks &amp; trailers takes some getting use to .  That also reflects in the new parking system that gives you three options &amp; an scaled amount of XP for the choice of trailer parking you decide to make.  Though you are limited for load types &amp; trailer types as well as truck types , this balance can be adressed by the Large modding community that as grown along side SCS &amp; it Truck game's   Here you will find maps given time , but for now even after only a few days since launch there are already several truck types that can be added along with knew trailers . cars . sounds &amp; game tweaks  This as always been the strongest part for the game type &amp; SCS have always supported modding &amp; I hope its stays that way.  For the low price you are paying here you get a good trucking based sim built on the same quality that SCS have showns us in the past with all there Trucking game's  Its may be small but they have started out with Licenced content pritty much a first as far as know for one of their game's  As I seem to remember their first few Euro based truck games shiped with unreal truck names &amp; it took several versions of those games to get the licences for the rights to use those brands.  So ATS will grow over the year now just like ETS 2 as into the game it is now.  SCS will listen to players feed back &amp; improve the game play and features , &amp; I am sure the modders with do the same. Buy it .  It a lot of fun &amp; It will only get better.  Pro  Fair price for the size &amp; content.  SCS are one of the best devlopers around when it come's to support &amp; developing their games.  ATS should be no different when it comes to modding and already as several mods to download or in development.  The game runs well out of the box even on older hardware like I am using.  Cons Limited trucks types.  Only two maps.  Time scaling feels unbalanced.  But nothing that I could makes the game not worth buying .  If you like trucks or just want some relaxing driving then this is as good as it gets. ",

Comparing this to ETS2, I would say that this game has several improvements in terms of gameplay. One of which is the new trailer parking options. I find it very pleasing to be able to choose how you would like to park the trailer.  The trucks themselves are quite different from the trucks in ETS. The trucks in this game have long bonnets, and I find it rather difficult to turn since I am used to the bonnet-less European trucks from ETS.  Moving on to the map. The map in this game is still small compared to the map in ETS2. Currently, the game only has 2 states in its map.  Overall, however, I think that this game is very enjoyable to play, and I find it relaxing to play this game, especially while listening to music.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: If you think you might like it, you probably will. If you don't see the point, don't expect it to surprise you. There are problems, but I expect them to improve with DLC and patching.  I'm not much into hard-sim games, but for some reason this one appealed. I couldn't even explain why.  This game doubles up as a hardcore truck-driving simulator, and a casual time-sink.   If you want to get a steering-wheel controller, manual shifter input and analogue pedals, play the whole game from the driver's camera perspective and grind out your hours as a big-rig stalwart, it's well set up for that. Slowly build your business, earn the right to take high-value cargo for long distance hauls, plan your fuel &amp; rest stops, watch your speed and park your trailer perfectly every time for bonus XP.  But if you just want to use your WASD &amp; mouse, pick up a Quick Job and drive from point-to-point for ten minutes, bashing through the occasional stop-start idiot who clogs up the junction, ditching the trailer at the gate and logging off again... well, that's totally fine too. It's a sim. You can be as serious or casual as you like.  Both are fun, in different ways, and the game does well at supporting both styles of play.  POSITIVE I have one thing to say here, but it's a big one: this game is, on occasion, breathtakingly beatufiul. I have had moments when a sunrise vista has opened up before me, after a gruelling 15hr (well, 15m) night drive through a featureless desert, pushing the speed limit to try and hit my destination before blacking out from exhaustion, and the moment has given me *real feels!* Like, a wistful wanderlust, or a warm familiar feeling. In some small way, I felt what it was like to be a long-haul trucker. This can only be achieved by a number of things coming together. Distinct and recognisable landscapes; above-par atmospheric lighting &amp; graphics, sufficient technical challenge to keep you focussed and slightly stressed for long periods of time, and a solid enough engine to make it all feel immersive. I was genuinely startled when some tumbleweeds blazed across the road in my headlights one night. That's only one positive, but it can't be overstated.  NEGATIVE There are bugs. It's a sim, so there are always limitations on realism, but the AI of police and other road users is occasionally crushingly stupid or arbitrary. There is also a limit on the game's size - two states (at launch) greatly scaled-down only gives you a few hours' driving before you've seen it all. The details are pretty good and I'm sure it'll be improved by DLC in future, but for now it's a big limitation. Sometimes, very rarely, using a Steam Controller, the control scheme will just break, and you'll go careening into a barrier at 55mph for no reason. Such immersion-breaking is criminal for a sim, and I hope Steam and/or the developers get on that ASAP. Today my controller suddenly started providing massive haptic feedback, contrary to my settings, so... yeah. New game, new technology. Fingers crossed. The biggest problem, though, is the strategic side of things. Upgrading your truck (beyond a bigger engine &amp; improved gearbox) is very costly but basically pointless. It's a cosmetic change to something you pretty much never see. But then the only other thing you can spend your hard-earned cash on is growing the business, which... just brings in more money. I don't know what else you could expect from a truck sim, but it seems like a one-dimensional management game has been tacked on the side with little purpose.  Once I realised the larger game offered little more than the (casual) Quick Job mode, the game lost a lot of its appeal. It was a cathartic ride up to that point, though, so I'll probably still dip in occasionally, and I'm happy to recommend it for the money. If the challenge of technical driving appeals to you, this is worth a look.",

            "review_text": "ok so ATS. At first glance most will and appear to have said it looks like a very well done expansion pack for ETS2. While in some ways i do agree, overall i do not.   This is another score for SCS. While there is not much going on overall (being that there is only 2 trucks and 2 states to drive in) there is something rather satisfying about driving a Kenworth or Peterbilt along North American Roads with precious cargo.   The game is rather small right now. But so far i have throughly enjoyed the 68 hours i have played it so far. I am down now to two cities left to deliver cargo to and about 65% of all roads driven on.   One thing that is a bit disappointing is the lack of overall accessories and slots to drop stuff onto on the two trucks available (Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt 579). Both trucks are nice to drive however. Plus the fact that truck and truck accessory mods from ETS2 are for the most part compatible with a few easy def file changes. Which has resulted in numerous truck mods and accessories being made available.   For those that are familiar with ETS2 may find this game a little lacking. However it is still just as oddly engrossing as it's european cousin.   ATS has the potential to be totally awesome once all of the USA is finally added as well as DLC's to add Canadian destinations and Mexican destinations will make this the most expansive game in SCS's library (considering the fact that once all of Canada is added it will add the 3rd largest physical country in the world with some of the worlds most dangerous trucking roads in the world). As well, the possabilities that can come from adding in Mexico is staggering.  Great first release. i for one will be buying each and every DLC for this game.   Good Job SCS.  Keep on Truckin'",

Sounds let you really feel the power of the truck road system is good and makes more sense in some cases than the actual roads. Same solid gameplay of ETS2 fame.  Neutral:  The game itself is for all intent and purpose still Euro truck sim 2, just with american trucks and map.. so if your a fan of ETS2 its good, if not well this title probably wont be your cup of tea either.  Only two trucks... but with quite a few chassis/body options: Personally I prefer this to 20 fake trucks.. you may find it limiting so I list it as a nuetral.  Controls I don't have a steering wheel so I can only speak to keyboard.. but the truck don't seem to handle aswell as their ETS2 counterparts. Of course that could also just be my opinion so take it with a grain of salt.  Environment; this is different from scenery to me because graphically its nice, but seriously there are more vehicle in america than 1950's cruisers, RV's, Semi's, and cops.  Fines: Holy crap police presence. There is no escaping the fines in this game.. ETS2 gave you speed traps that once you learned where they were you could slow down for em. Here? every third car is a cop who can and will pull you over for 4mph over the speed limit. Nice because it forces you to treat it more like a sim... but a tad over done IMO.  Bad: Smallish map, I get more is coming out.. I really do.. and I wish I didn't have to list this as a bad.. but when you can run any route before you've even maxed your distance stat.. well thats not beuno.  AI; its been a plague on this series even in ETS2 and it didn't get any smarter here.. same stupid 4wheelers doing stupid things right into the side of your truck.   TL/DR If you are a diehard fan of truck games buy it, if you like sims buy it. If you want a finished US map with a 48 states and a total overhaul from ETS2.. well maybe wait awhile and catch it on sale after some more content has released.",

I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the ETS series, and for anyone thinking of trying out the series for the first time.  As for the newcomers, keep in mind this is not a game designed for freeroaming, constantly popping in and out of any vehicle you want, or for professionally managing a business; it's a truck driving sim. You drive trucks under an employer until you make enough money to buy your own truck. From there on you haul various types of cargo to build your wealth. You then move on to expand your garage(s), buy more trucks, hire drivers, and make money. From a broad standpoint, yes it does simulate business, but that's not the primary goal of the game; it's for driving trucks.  Summary summed up: if you want to drive anything you please any time or manage a business from a professional standpoint, this game is not what you're hunting.

Ticking beneath all this like a diesel thrum are the systems that piece each journey together; the acquisition of XP that sees you level up and opens up more trucks and more parts, the growing income that allows you to buy more garages, to hire more drivers and to take on more jobs. There's a satisfying sense of progression that sits neatly alongside your excursions, which themselves can escalate as you move on: longer journeys see you battling fatigue and looking for rest-stops lest you fall asleep at the wheel.  If that all sounds familiar, well it is. Beyond the shift in location and a handful of very minor tweaks - those patrolling police cars, the ability to haul longer cargo and a slightly fancier GPS unit - this is quite simply Euro Truck Simulator 2 with a new lick of chrome and transposed to America, with the front-end and all the slow crawl of empire building it enables near-identical. In many ways, it's a more limited game, too.  More is on its way, and given how Euro Truck Simulator 2 quickly expanded thanks to SCS Software and the modding community's efforts, it's safe to assume American Truck Simulator will slowly fill out. Right now, though, it's an openly modest game - with a £14.99 price tag to reflect that - rather than a full-blown sequel. What you're currently buying into is the pull of those American roads, and the slightly mysterious promise of where they'll head next; Arizona is next on the menu, and after that there's the hope that SCS Software could head all the way to the midwest and beyond.

Not one person has yet taken my interest, even though many beautiful women and handsome gentlemen have all attempted to win my affection. Nothing satisfied me. Not until I played American truck simulator. I first saw the game through various images shared over social media, which made me weak at the knees. 'What were these magnificant beasts?'. My heart raced at these images, and I grew obsessed with this illusive game. Finally, after months of anticipation and the purchase of a very expensive wheel, the game was released, allowing me to finally get inside the beasts I yearned for. I quickly made a profile, navigating the menus as fast as the game would allow me to, hands shaking in the process. Then, finally, I was inside the magnificant beast. My heart stood still, sweat drooling down my face. I began to drive. Suddenly, I began to violently shake as I began to drive. I began to feel pleasure for the first time in my life as a swooped around the Nevada desert carrying 18t of beans to my awaiting customer. The sudden release of pressure must have overwhelmed me, as I blacked out as I got the truck to hit 80 MPH I woke up 3 hours later, my computer screen covered in sperm. My chair leg was in my ♥♥♥, and my ♥♥♥♥♥ was inside my computer, appearing to be so hard it smashed the fans. Best day ever",

I feel this game could have been a great opportunity to build a modern truck sim from the ground up, and improve upon the problems that where apparent in ETS2. However, SCS, instead of improving the formula, have just copied ETS2 problems and all. If you have never purchased a truck sim from SCS before then this is not a bad buy, you will probably have fun.

Things I like: -Long American Trucks (interior is awesome) -Map feels alive and is very detailed (I mean map and buildings not cars on the road) -Awesome American Theme -Truck Customization  -Mod support (Cool mods in the future)  Things I dislike: -Repetitive cars on the road -Speeding tickets (I don't get how it works) -Can't buy old trucks, only new and you can achieve everything pretty fast -Annoying Police, I got a speeding ticket while going 35mph and allowed zone was 55mph.. -AI is still stupid )  Game is currently 20$, is it worth it? If you ask me its pretty fair, if you're a trucking simulation fan I'd definitely recommend it. Also Game size is 1gb so that pretty much tells you how much content you have in it. My guess would be 50-100 hours of gameplay till you unlock and explore everything you get with the base game.  *EDIT* Also game is still pretty unfinished so if you don't want to waste 20$ yet just wait for new updates.",

            "review_text": "I rarely ever write a review on a game but this one definitely merits it. First off I have been looking forward to playing this since the first day I heard it was in development. Now you could call me a fanboy for ATS, but I have hundreds of hours on ETS2. First i'd like to point out the obvious facts that we all know and seem to be the griping points about the game to which I have no problem with, two trucks ( with different configurations ) and two states with 30 cities total. This was known if you read any of the dev's latest pre release blogs. Is it ETS2 quality yet?, no, but neither was ETS2 until the community embraced it and helped the dev's push it to what it has become, an absolutely AMAZING game. The same can and hopefully will be applied to ATS. Yes the initial release is a little bleak, the stock truck sounds are decent, the entire economy is modeled on the ETS platform ( which works perfectly since any of us that have played ETS are very familiar with ) Another gripe ive seen is that the graphics are sub par to ETS2. Keep in mind they went for a grittier look seeing how we're out in the desert not everything is pretty and polished its more sandblasted and rusty. Now if you can look past the initial lack of features continue to follow me. Originally only the boxed retail version of this game was to get any DLC, which the dev's generously gave ALL of us for free including Arizona when it becomes available. Couple that with the fact that they've tripled their manpower to work on finishing the game while keeping up with updating ETS2 thats a lot of work for a smaller software company to take on. I can only look forward to seeing the amazing direction this game is going to progress in the future seeing how the modding community is already full bore churning out content on release day. Here's how I rate the game  - Same addictive game play as ETS2 - New features such as parking methods and weigh stations - Very large map for only 30 cities - improved AI traffic  - mesmerizing scenery transitions  I honestly have no complaints with the game other than a minor gripe about the fine amounts and the 'rolling radars' and a few bugs that obviously are going to be in a new game but overall I foresee myself enjoying hundreds of hours on this title as it progresses. Hands down I would highly recommend this game to a friend",

As they added the Kenworth W900 (I think that's what it's called). I quickly got a $50K loan and traded in my Peterbilt for the new beast :). They also fixed the speed limit issue, where if it dropped from 55 to 35 you would have no time to adjust. Now there is more time to adjust your speed.",

Even those wanting long routes, while there isn't cross country type hauls, there are still some that take you a couple of full 'in game days' to complete.  I have put lots of hours into this game already and am really enjoying it, and excited that more is coming.

On a lighter note i've enjoyed the games attention to detail immensely, even if it is confined to 2 trucks and 2 states for the time being, but ultimately I am 12 hours in at the time of review and the game feels stale, hence nevada better be very interesting and expansive or i'll feel cheated of £15",

The game plays very similarly to ETS2, but with an American flavour. One thing I don't really like is that the police and fines system is a bit annoying. If you're on a road with a speed limit of 30mph and are going 31mph then you will be fined $1,000. Though, that could just be typical American cops, right?  As it stands, the game is currently a 7/10. It's fun, and it is entertaining to just tune out of the world and stick on some music or a podcast. However, it lacks a lot of content and has several bugs that need to be fixed. If it gets these fixes it could easily be a 8 or 9/10 game.",

            "review_text": "Was pretty hyped about American Truck Simulator, but, now, after i played it, i am a little bit dissapointed.  Gameplay-wise, it's ETS2. Not much to say about it, it's the same engine, the same game.   Now, content-wise, it's very thin.  Trucks: Two of them. I know that they said that will be more once the fix the licenses, but, they didn't assured anyone that they are gonna be free. If you take a look at Library page, you will see that these two trucks are presented as DLC. Also, they are not too different one from each other. They look pretty similar, and they feel similar, so, you can basically say that you have only one truck. I don't understand this approach, unless they specifically wanted to sell other trucks. On ETS2, they didn't had this problem, they released enough content from the beginning, even if the trucks had different names than the original ones.   Map: Two states, California and Nevada, with the thrid one being announced as free DLC for owners (Arizona). And the size it's shrinked compared with ETS2. Basically, ATS mile it's shorter than ETS2 mile. So, you will go through all the cities pretty fast. In first two hours of gameplay, i managed to discover 10% of content. And this issue was 'fixed' by making the cities more crowded and adding the police element into the game. Having to wait longer on lights and STOP signs takes time from your delivery, and, getting huge fines makes you have to play more, as you will spend a lot on traffic fines. You are 58 in an 55 limit zone, poof $1000 are gone.   The game it's great for someone really passioned about America, that traveled a lot in the country and can relate with the landmarks showned. Those can be pretty special. The game got that going for it, but i don't think it's enough.   I expect the 'milking' to be extreme in the case of ATS, just by looking on how the 'free DLCs' are looking. Each state will probably be released as DLC and probably most trucks too, so expect to spend a lot of money to have the 'full game'. I'm not necessary against DLCs, but when the game it's designed empty, in order to be filled with payed content in the future, it seems a little bit extreme.   What i hate more about this it's that the ETS2 players getting screwed for it. If anything, SCS Software should show a great deal of respect for their players, as they are the ones that made their game what is today. Modding communities are vibrant and they are the one selling a lot of copies of their games. As an 'reward', there's no official modding support, not even an Steam Workshop.   I tend to doubt the SCS Software marketing decisions. The game it's a big billboard. Instead of milking the players, why wouldn't you try to 'milk' the real companies. Some of them would probably accept to pay for in-game advertising. The game content it's not offensive in any way, some companies allready have their bogus representation, like 'UDC'. When i put 'American truck' and 'advertising' terms toghether, i'm getting the image of the iconic Coca Cola red truck. It's hard for me to believe that brand representatives would be against having their iconic image in the game.   I can recommend the game only if you are really into American culture, if you know the landmarks and you can relate to them. I would not recommend it if you are playing ETS2 already and just want something different. It's not different, you get much more content in basic version of ETS2.",

My only disappointment is the fact that the game only comes with 2 states, California and Nevada, with Arizona coming soon.

It doesn't? Well, whatever. Here are my initial thoughts on ATS:  - It's cheaper at launch that ETS2 was.   Yes, it's technically a smaller game and it's basically the same engine as we got from ETS2, but it's also more affordable. We weren't really promised anything other than their standard Truck Simulator fare set in America, so I don't see a problem with this.  - The graphics look marginally improved over ETS2.  It's true. Many of the textures in ATS are nicer overall than the ones you will find in ETS2. It's not a huge improvement, but it's something.  - There are a few new gameplay aspects.  Perhaps my favorite new addition is the ability to front park when delivering a load. I was never any good at parking the traditional way in ETS2, so it's quite nice to be given the option to earn a few extra EXP for parking the truck in a less than stellar fashion that gets the job done.  Of course, they also went ahead and increased the cost of speeding tickets and whatnot, so that could change the way some people play the game. Oh, and it seemed as it the truck went through fuel a bit faster, but I couldn't really tell with any degree of certainty in just my first few playthroughs.   - They can, and most likely will add DLC to this game.  For those complaining that you only get two states to drive around in, trust me – we will see more. They added new areas via DLC for ETS2, so we're probably going to see the same approach for ATS as well. Once again, although this means added cost down the line, chances are that you'll be able to get a couple DLC packs and still not reach the full price that ETS2 was listed at when it first came out. It's important to put things into perspective, and the reality is that you'll probably get just as much enjoyment out of this game as you got out of ETS2, if in fact you liked that game. You might have to wait a bit longer to get more content, but at least they didn't charge you full price for half a game like you will see with SOME Triple A titles.   Overall, I have to say this game is a win for me thus far.",

Before hand, the already *tiny* map at release (CA, NV, AZ) was made even worse by the developement team's 'idea' of scaling the map *smaller* than the scale of their ETS2 game. Let me make that more clear for those of you that just got hit in the head with a hammer. The Dev team, at one point in time, was completely fine with the game Map in ATS being *smaller* than ETS2. Cause everyone knows Europe is bigger.... Which lead to people traveling from S CA, to N CA, in 30 real time minutes. What a horribly thought out idea. But hey, they are Europeans.  Thankfully that decision seemed to ♥♥♥♥ off enough Americans at a fundemental level that, to their credit, they decided to undertake the 'huge' deal of rescaling the map. A 'huge' deal, which would have never been a problem, had they not decided to scale the map smaller in the first place. But again to their credit, they chose to fix the issue. Easily the biggest issue everyone had with the game, other than being forced to drive around on the Gay Coast that most Americans would be fine to see sink into the Ocean, or Cede from the Union because of President Elect Trump.  I put for this money, and review, in the hopes that SCS will now be more focused on *building the map up* on both ETS2 and ATS, rather than spending time, and my money, on putting out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t paintscheme DLCs every three days.  *SCS Work.On.The.Map. We have community mods that allow us to have paintschemes we want. Add Spain, the rest of Italy, the Balkens, The Baltics, and Russia in ETS2. And get to work adding the other *47* states you still have to work on for ATS. I swear if you start putting out more Paintscheme crap, I will get a refund. I will not tolerate this kind of junk, when so much more important work is still left to be done.* You can crap out Paintschemes with my support, *only once you finish the maps*, and not one second before so.

I cant wait for Arizona to be relaesed, as well as other possible states. Would love to be able to do coast-to-coast drives! I do have one complaint though. There is just too many cops, and theyre too strict. Getting a $1000 speeding ticket for doing 61 in a 55 is frustrating. They should have made it so it was a chance if you got a ticket (like in real life), and the fine should differ depending on speed. Still, Im glad i bought this, its a wonderful game at a wonderful price!",

I find ATS to be more appealing to look at than ETS 2 and the game is a lot smoother which provides a better experience.  While some will say it's pretty much the same what do you expect? Helicopters flying across the sky, Jets dog fighting and cars blowing up. While that would be pretty awesome I don't think it's the style they were going for. I wouldn't mind them focusing on making everything more real, so maybe cops will pull you over for speeding or you'll hear an emergency siren behind you and then pull to the side to let it pass, which would be amazing if they added in though I am happy enough without it.  If they go for ET3 or ATS2 then I would expect something game changinly different like that and more but it's £15 and offers a different look at truck driving which is what it's meant to do.  --Conclusion--  I give the game a 9/10 for being a great different take on Truck driving and a must buy for people who love ETS 2 for what it is and want more of the game but with a change of scenery, if you're new and want a truck driving game I'd recommend this over ETS 2 mainly because I like this one more due to the varying terrains and scenery.  P.S. If anyone thinks this is the final product it's not, they are currently working on an Arizona Expansion which will be free, I would also think that's not the last of it since they did something similar with ETS 2 with releasing content after release.",

I should also mention that I can play the game on ultra settings, so I don't understand why the game would have a limitation like this.  The gameplay is good, as the trucks actually feel like trucks, instead of just light-weighted moving things that will fly all over the place. ETS2 also had realistic trucks. The cities in the game also look better, as they aren't as small as ETS2 and they actually look like the cities in real life, but of course scaled down.  I'm also happy that they are slowly updating the game and adding new states as they go along.  Otherwise, the game overall is good, but seems a little rushed in places, but that is expected for a game that has only just been released and I'm hoping the developers will fix any problems as soon as possible.",

Lowered from 2560 to 1920 hoping the issue will improve, well to my surprise, it did not, so the game doesn't even support current technology across the fact the game was released in 2016, it's internals are good old ETC and acts as new thing even though it can't even do that! I'm extremely disappointed!!! Even the modding community can make the game look and feel way better than the actual developers, I believe that this title is doomed and should be released open source for its existence sakes. Looking back to viewing the trailer for this game year ago, the excitement of how polished the game looks, darn good, time and day, it seemed as if it runs on brand new HDR implemented engine, that's not true, and radio? Nowhere, the cities are empty, highways are boring, intersections and highway bridges and complexity is nowhere real American, it's just a rip from Europe which makes this absolutely horrid to name American just because they changed the road layout, terrain and vehicle models, skins etc. This lads, is the dlc presented to us as a new game? I wish I could get my money back even though I got it on sale, it's waaaay overpriced to my liking. I haven't even see the night in the game, everything from the beginning is set to daylight, very weary and repetitive, time schedule is so tight that you barely make it to deliver the cargo, matter of fact, it's impossible w/o getting the speeding ticket, which also, there is no speed tolerance, perhaps forgiving you 1 mile over the limit. Traffic doesn't random, always that same classic boring bs. Truckers hauling along are ai dead. I mean, I was expecting something entirely different than what I got. Put some high-res textures, dynamic weather with nice storm effects, voice guided GPS! Radio inquiries about situations and responses from other truckers in close and far proximity? No! You give us pedestrians who are at the docking and loading sites but nowhere in the cities?! I'm sorry but this doesn't approve you to name this a standalone game not to mention the name you gave this piece of crap. I guess you just spat it out in hope ppl will love this or turn at the modding community once again. With ETC2 it wasn't so necessary, as it reflected its time of release, but this! This is absolute H@R$E$#!T, once again, I'm extremely, extremely disappointed. Happy new year!",

            "review_text": "I wanted to review this game from a Californian's perspective.   The game is generally on par with ETS2. The parking is harder, but the physics and simulation, along with game play, is about the same. So in that respect its not much different than ETS2. However, since we in America are so excited to get an American version of the game, I really want to comment on that part of it. For me the cool part is to be able to base my garage in my real home town.  First, there are a lot of great landmark and local visuals that make this stand out, even in the smaller cities. I found several local landmarks in my own home town which is fantastic. It's much more 'personalized' than ETS2 was, which is great. You won't be disappointed in this.  However, the big let down for me is the immense mistakes on their map of California's freeway/highway system. It's not that its off a little bit, it's just plain WRONG! It seems that the map developers didn't try very hard to follow any real map, and made up their own freeways and routes. There are so many mistakes it's really sad. Takes a lot of fun out of driving in 'my back yard'.  Another interesting thing is the cities that are included map, and the ones that aren't. It's an odd collection of towns that are included, verses those left out, to be sure. You would expect the major cities to be selected, but it seems the developers have a hard time determining what the major California cities are, not to mention where they are located. Must not have had access to Google Earth or Wikipedia I guess.   Then there is the missing geographic features for the road systems. But I don't want to bore you with flat roads where there should be mountain ranges and passes. Someone told me in a discussion not to expect too much, since it's a 'simulator'. But I wonder what they were trying to 'Simulate', since it wasn't California as I know it (at least not our major cities and road system)? I bring this up because many people are hoping for maps of their own states. I wouldn't get your hopes to high if this is any indication.  But, on the whole, it's a fun game, Is it buggy? Of course. But I'm sure they'll improve on it. Personally, I just hope they fix the map a little better. It was still worth the $20 for me!  ",

It runs even smoother than Euro Truck 2, and the detail, especially in the cities is astounding! I especially like that loads can be delivered to stores, gas stations, etc... The only downside to this early purchase is that it only comes currently with California and Nevada. But SCS Software has a brilliant reputation for delivering a high quality, reasonably priced product as promised. They are offering the first DLC (Arizona) free of cost, and I have no doubt that other DLC's will be produced regularly. I for one will be expectantly waiting for each and every DLC and have no doubt that each and every one of them will be of the highest caliber, as all of their previous ETS 2 DLC's didn't disappoint. They delivered a day early, and I couldn't beleive that they updated the game less than an hour after I purchased it! I highly recommend this game as possibly the most realistic and smooth truck simulator on the American continent. Good job SCS!",

There are sharp edges and the texture used for them looks  like PS1 quality. This is jarring really spoils immersion. - Sense of speed isn't quite right. Keeping to 30mph speed lmit is hard because it is SO slow. - $1000 speeding fines are too much. - A good number of NPC vehicles don't have all four wheels touching the road in certain areas. - Traffic AI has occasional blips. slowing down and bunching up at times on the freeway for no  reason. - It is very hard turning left at some junctions, the are no gaps in the traffic to turn.  For first day of release these things can be forgiven. Please developers, re-do the textures of the hills in Nevada and get all vehicle wheels touching the road, these are my two biggest gripes so far, they ruin immersion.  Is it worth £15? Yes.

There are small details worked into the game world everywhere if you take the time to look, and the environment feels much more rich and 'lived in' then previous SCS maps, as well as uniquely American. As well as the improvements to the environment, there has been some polish to the simulation aspect of the game too (ex: 24 hour cycle with fatigue simulation on as opposed to 20 hour cycle in ETS), and some new difficulty settings were added (advanced gearshift for players with steering wheel). If you're looking into a truck sim just to cover as much ground as possible, stick with Euro Truck Simulator 2 at this point, but if you genuinely enjoy a peaceful drive and taking in all the scenery along the way (and don't mind a few speeding tickets from the very sharp law enforcement) then ATS is a great choice. If you do get bored with the stock game, there are already some quality mods available, with more being introduced on a daily basis, much like with Euro Truck over the last couple of years.",

The only thing that is unclear to anyone looking to buy or anyone that has already bought it is if the additional states will need to be paid for individually, or if they will come in packs like 'Midwest'. It is still a pretty cheap game for what it offers, and I would recommend it if you are looking for a bit more of the same that ETS2 had, but in a beautiful and vibrant US setting which will be expanded on very soon with the free Arizona expansion. Perfect game for Truck enthusiasts or people who want a relaxing driving game in general. I didn't play a whole lot of ETS2, but will be playing more of this since it's in the US.  Pros:  -New Location to Explore! (The US, the place where trucking stereotypes thrive) -Finally be able to relieve your fantasies of being an American Truck Driver -You can do this without the fatigue or stress of being a real truck driver. -A skill system taken from ETS2, but works well nonetheless. -You can manage your own trucking company. -You can customize your trucks and make them the way you want them to be.  Cons:  -Tickets for traffic offenses can be a bit too high and penalizing. (SERIOUSLY, $700 FOR GOING 4 MPH ABOVE THE LIMIT, COME ON!) -The Traffic AI loves to troll you whenever you are trying to yield onto a road, and as such you could be prone to damage, 10 miles before your destination. -Hard to get money in the beginning compared to ETS2, but understandable (The US has a bad economy). -Cops everywhere like its second nature. (Really? You have nothing better to do than stalk a truck driver? Get back to work protecting banks or racial profiling or something)  All in all though, it's a pretty fun game and would recommend anyone who is on the fence to pick it up and try it out. You will almost certainly like it for what it is, especially when you start to mod the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out of it.  9/10",

I do hope the DLC maps will consist of multiple states, otherwise it'll be 2020 or later before they reach the east coast.  It's the same fun, relaxing experience ETS2 is, and an interesting look at how Europeans view America. An example is the ridiculous numbers of wood panel station wagons on the road, and the other classic cars. One complaint, however, is the equally ridiculous numbers of cops. Like everywhere all the time. Some work needs to be done on how forgiving the game is with speeding violations, you can be ticketed almost instantaneously when entering a slower zone if there's a cop nearby.",

I modded ETS to have US trucks, but it just wasn't the same. I am so happy that this is finally here, and moreso that its not just a copy paste of city types from ETS2. The cities now are much more varied and interesting to drive through (although ETS had some interesting places and realistic locales). It's more of the same, and i love it for that.  2 things i think could make this game better: Physics: Boring physics. I would love if they took the series into the Spintires realm of physics. Side roads: These main roads are not all that tuckers face. There are much more inense alternate routes, side roads and dirt trails through mountains, over dank bridges and through shallow river crossings. Truck Dealers: Maybe modders can figure this out, but once youve run out of truck slots, or you have two trucks that take up the same slots, my game crashes. Maybe there could be a custom trucks dealer that has unlimited, self populated slots... anyways moving on.  Modding is just as great as previous titles. The inclusion of a mod manager from the start is helpful and the community has been doing some great things.  Pros: Graphics are just as good, if not better than previous. Sound is tough and realistic. Relaxing (although i doubt its really this relaxing in real life).  Cons: Lack of variety in cities and vehicles (without modding).

            "review_text": " TL;DR : ATS is a great game which captures the feeling of the open road, however is quite limited at this moment of time.  Ahh, American Truck Simulator. What a great continuation to the Truck Sim legacy.  American Truck Simulator is a sequel of sorts to Euro Truck Simulator 2 (however more like a very large expansion), and a very similar game in fact. American Truck Simulator is, well, a truck simulator, where you must build your land shipping empire from the ground up. You start with nothing. No money. No truck. You also have a very limited amount of jobs you can do (low value, short distance, non-hazardous, and normal times only). From there you do odd jobs, getting hired by other companies and driving their trucks, and slowly start to build up your cash reserves. Once you get enough money, you can buy your very own truck, where you have to do maintenance, pay for gas, and all the other fantastic things that come with owning a vehicle. From then on jobs pay more, and you can upgrade your truck, and even hire drivers and buy trucks for them, and they start to generate income on their own, taking jobs and delivering. (NOTE: You can take out a bank loan, instead of doing dozens of odd jobs, but the interest on the loan can be quite a weight on your shoulders)  Now, do NOT let the word 'Simulator' put you off. This does not feel like a simulator. People generally think of boring, tedious, and mundane when they read 'Simulator'. This game is rather fun, sometimes tense, and liberating. Another point I must make is, I have no idea how, but they perfectly capture the feeling of driving, and the feeling of the open road.  As for the visuals, many textures up close look outdated and many would likely agree they could use a new graphics engine. However, in general the visuals are very satisfying, save for the occasional close-up of an NPC driver.  And then there is the world, which likely recieves the most criticism out of any aspect in this game. The world as of yet consists of California and Nevada. However this area is quite large, it is possible to have fully explored it within 10hrs, and many fans of ETS2 will likely be dissapointed at this, as that game had 16 different countries. Do not be worried however, as there is another state, Arizona, coming very soon. The devs plan to add all of Canada and the USA, and potential for a map stretching down to the Panama Canal, however it will be 'vote with your wallet'. Land will be sold in expansion packs after Arizona most likely.  One more dissapointing aspect is the number of trucks available for purchase at the moment. A grand total of  TWO TRUCKS . This is not due to dev laziness however, but rather because licensing/negotiation with the actual manufacturers has been quite slow. More trucks are on the way.  All in all, this game is great, and I highly reccomend it. Even if you are upset about the lack of content at this moment, there is always ETS2 to tide you over until then. Buy this game, especially with the very low price $28.99CDN ($25USD?)",

Let me just say if you NEVER played ETS 2, this game may be alright for you to get you warmed up for things to come. However, if you came from ETS 2, like many have said it feels like a DLC than a base game.  I read the reviews and see the complaints people have about how the scaling is awful. I just feel if we had more West Coast states than just 2. I'm sure the scaling wouldn't matter a much. Also, in your skills menu there's no need to max out Long DIstance because the distance isn't that far as of now.  I know why there's just 2 trucks because of licensing, for I feel people felt it should of been ready by release.  WIth that out of the way, ATS is nice despite it limitation. As I said, coming from ETS2 you feel so limited extremely. Which probably why I can't recommend the game to any ETS 2 players. They would have the taste of more for such limited assets in the game. I hope with the additon of Arizona will add some mileage soon. But it will be modders to the rescue to add some scope and depth to the game while SCS works on DLC... which many hope its not a per state bases and more of a region bases (West Coast, Midwest, South, MId Atlantic, North East/New England).  Let this be a lesson SCS, sequels are always hard to do well because of the success of it predecessor. I know you'll improve the game.",

            "review_text": "SCS software has pulled out another epic simulator for the trucking community with American Truck Simulator.  If you're familiar with the software background of ETS2, you're covered. However, theres a few things to keep in mind with these differences. 1. Truck geometry (size) is entirely different from ETS2, you'll have to relearn your truckspace and angle points. If you're new to it, you won't have an problems learning the geometry. 2. Speedzones are tricky, especially in California (now I see why some of my professional trucking friends try to avoid driving through there). [Corrected - v1.1.1 Allowing time to change to different speedzones] 3. Cops are not very forgiving in CA, so watch your speed and traffic light timings. [Nerfed by v1.1.1 - Alot of folks were verbal, figured ya learn from driving in an area. Guess not for many folks] 4. For now, work on your ADR certs and high value cargo for now until they expand further out of Cali and Nevada. 5. There are weird easter eggs and hidden gems to seek out in the game, you'll easily spot them so I won't spoil them.  A biggie:  1. It is a solid simulator/game with many new goodies that will be coming along the line over the progress of updates/upgrades. 2. It is 64-bit native, so you need a 64-bit machine to run it properly. They still have 32-bit floating around but keep in mind that they stress that it is 'NOT SUPPORTED' in the event you have tech problems. They're slowly phasing out the 32-bit flavor to allow the game to have more flexibility on machines with decent resources handy and not choking on limitations.  The only hiccup I've seen sofar (as of this posting) is that the AI vehicles are hovering on the roadways.  Wishlist for the game (which would liven the experience a little more): 1. Dynamic construction areas (changes to a random location every 30 game time days). 2. Electronic road boards (the type the DOT uses, not the roadside adverts [though, thats also not a bad idea too]). 3. Signs that read 'Reduce Speed Ahead' and 'Construction Zone Ahead'. May help prevent trailer damages in the event an AI plows into the back end when you slam on the brakes due to sudden speedzone changes (coughcalicough). [fixed via Ver 1.1.1 - Time allowance to reduce speed applied. Cops nerfed based on Driver's Level]  Note: In any situation where you see a Prius make a right turn into your right of way. You will crash if you don't catch up on the brakes. For some odd reason, the Prius is suicidal. Sofar, I've seen this happen 7 times in Cali.",

            "review_text": "This game is an anomaly. Basically, if you think you will like it, then you probably will. If you aren't sure, don't. It's a much safer bet to get Euro truck sim since it is much more fleshed out.  In ATS the scaling is a bit wonky. It takes no time at all to get from las angeles to reno, which is stupid becuase that drive is like driving the entire map in ETS. Granted, the US is HUGE and would take forever to traverse if the scaling was bigger.  The start of the game is quite shakey, since there are only two states and two truck companys. I know that eventually the liscencing will come around and all will be good after more states are added. However I think DLC is terrible for video games and I personally would rather of waited a year or two more to get a super fleshed out game, rather than 30% of the content.  Lastly, the police are like, WAY to picky. I realize that trucks are slower and I get that speeding is bad, but still. It's nowhere near that bad in reality.  Now that my major beefs are out of the way, let me break down everything else  PROS +Pretty realistic, true to real life scenery +Overall good gameplay +Good graphics (although very rarely glitchy)  Cons +'Small' map (to scale). +Incredibly small amount of trucks. +Over reacting police. +Slightly messed up AI. +Accidents are either always for fault, or when they aren't you don't get money to help recover from the wreck. +Hud is exactly the same as ETS +Gui is nearly identical to ETS  As you can see my list of cons is larger than my list of pros, howeve I like the game to much to let that waiver my opinion. In all, Most of my issues will be patched in time, but like I said earlier, I would much rather have a fully fleshed out game a little late rather than have a half crap one where you have to wait to get the full experience. It loses it's awesomeness when you have to wait like that, after you bought the game.   TLDR: All in all, it's a solid enough game, and I really do enjoy it. If you think youd like it, then you probably will. If not then don't get it/",

I wont say it is better or worse than ETS but I will continue to play both for a long time to come. If people play ATS for two hours they have gotten there monies worth of entertainment. Where I am from I can't drive to the theatre, buy a ticket to a 2 hour movie with some popcorn and soda for less than $20. The movies is over in two hours and I can play ATS for the rest of my life if I want.

I have nearly 50 hours of real-world time, over a month of in-game time, and I can now say with certainty that I made the right move getting this game now. California and Nevada feel different, and they both have distinct and identifiable areas, plus plenty of fun details from food trucks to coastal basketball courts to shooting stars and even UFOs (!). Driving is challenging but relaxing. Free-roaming or taking jobs from one corner of the map to another adds up to more hours than I would have initially expected, even for those who want to feel truly immersed in the long-haul experience. I am very much looking forward to getting the upcoming Arizona expansion for free, and from how well California and Nevada were done, I expect Arizona will feel 'real' enough also.  Are there issues? Absolutely. There are plenty of bugs which need workarounds, such as not being able to rest in certain places, having a horrible time turning left in AI traffic, brutally unrealistic police AI [easy and free mods available for this] and glaring omission of major cities such as San Jose. However, the SCS team still deserves applause for taking on the challenge of starting to build the USA and capture the different complexities of American trucking.  I am thoroughly addicted to my rig and look forward to stepping into the cab every time to see where the available jobs take me next. I recommend you get into one of your own and drive while SCS's team expands and gives us even more land to conquer.",

Same with mid-roof configurations, they are driven by flatbed and tanker drivers, and most people in that line of work started out hauling a box, which is the lowest paying thing to haul. These guys get the tall sleepers due to aerodynamics.  Day cabs cannot sleep in their cab. They need to force drivers here to go to a motel to get sleep, and charge them to do so.  20 bucks a mile? What???? Not even close. Try 2 bucks a mile is great money. Speaking of a mile, if you go 55 miles per hour for 1 hour of game time, you should have went 55 miles, but you don't, you end up having gone less. Math fail.  400 miles is no where near a full day, but it takes a full day of driving time ingame to go that far. Highly unrealistic in that regard.

What makes this stand out more so, is the fact that you can use the mouse as well as the keyboard with the joystick.  In saying that, the time i have played with this truck simulator has been fun. Backing up your rig to attach a trailer, taking interstate roads as well as back roads, to which some can be a bit challenging to drop off your trailer or make that turn and get the clearance you need to get out again..   All in all, I think the steering could use a slight inprovement at times, i find the steering to not move as quickly as it would normally. With that said, it has some great features like radio for your own music and an option for a radio station link from the web... I do think it would make the game complete to have a shuffle button so you can mix and match your songs that you put into your game....  Graphics wise, I feel that open GL has a slightly better graphic quality to it on a AMD R9 390 Gigabyte 8GB ram graphics card, with HDMI and i assume that it is the default when you select to play..   Since I am in australia though, I would not mind seeing an option for Aussie roads with right hand drives and left lanes.. lol With that being said, I do hope to find some old trucks or if not, i do hope they make a mod that has old trucks like Atkinson and old fords ect.. though i am yet to stil lfind out what models are on this game...  All in all, its a great family game and something that the kids wouldlike, because kids big and small, like big toys like trucks ....",

Luckily SCS has toned them down so that as you progress they get more expensive. Woo!  Also, finally being able to think, 'Am I too close to this car in front of me?' makes me more worried about whats around me since plowing in to people at 55 MPH on the highway because suddenly we're passing through Sacramento or something and the speed limit has dropped to 30...  And finally both games have Workshop support. So prepare to overload your game and bandwith.  So I will have to say, If you enjoyed ETS2, and you want to be more closer to home. Get this game.

And i am going to start with the things that i consider are not perfect (bad things) or this that i would love to see implemented in the game: - After ETS - ETS2 and now ATS, there is still no god damn smoke from the exhaust, wich is terrible. This huge semi-trucks should leave a thick black cloud of smoke, like in real life, but no, still not in 2016.  - You guys from SCS still didn't figured out the people need different engines with different engine sounds on trucks (please consider this, it would help alot of people, not only me).  - Another thing that i figured out is the weather, i just bumped up a little the rain probability and, from storm it changes to sunny weather in 10 secounds, every time.   - What's the purpose of the weight check, every time it goes green, it's just a useless stop from the road. It would be such a cool idea to pick up transports from the black market, you take the responsability for it but somehow you have to avoid the weight check.  - As the time of this review, we still don't have interior lighting, TV with news from weather around the map and accidents, it may sound crazy but it would be so cool to know what road to avoid so you don't wait until the accident area is clear or where to go around to avoid a storm. (Yes, i have some crazy ideas, that will spike the game interest more then a bit).  - Usually the terrain, is bland and boring, but i love from time to time to see a plane / birds.  - The AI is still really really REALLY TERRIBLE.  Good things:  - The map in so detailed in cities in comparison to ETS2, they are so vivid and alive, i was really happy to see this happening, more good things i wait to happend. - People in cities now are alive, they move like real people, they skate, they run etc. - I like seeing when i am driving planes zooming in the sky, crop dusters leaving a trail of smoke after them, tumbling weeds rolling across the road in the desert, abandoned rusty truck on the side of the road. - The new concept of 'rolling cops' (moving police cars) i really like, it's a welcome new thing, but it needs some real work, like they can spot me speeding even when they would not have the visibility (corners, walls, highway exits, etc). Also fines from the cops are terrible, nerf them please for the love of God!",

The reasons why are similar to those of many of the other reviewers of this game. I find it very relaxing to turn on some music and just make a few deliveries. It helps me calm down after a stressful day at work. Granted, these sim type games are not for everyone...which is fine. If you are, however, one of those who enjoy these sorts of games, or have enjoyed ETS2, you should definitely go for this one!  My only complaints are these: One, the AI drivers are awful. I don't know if the devs programmed them to be texting on their phones while they drive (which would be realistic, admittedly), but I for one see enough of these people in real life. The AI will merge directly ahead of you...or directly into the side of your trailer.  Two: The freeways. I am American and have been driving on the Interstate system since I was 15, and have never encountered a T-intersection with a stop sign to get onto the freeway, which is present in several locations in ATS. Making a left turn in these intersections is harrowing, as you must wait what seems like forever for a break in traffic that MIGHT be long enough for your slow-accelerating truck to merge safely - and even then, the AI traffic may just crash into you anyway. It just seems like overpasses and on-ramps should be used in these situations, as they would IRL.  Three: This is not really the fault of the developers, and it's not really a complaint, as I understand the restrictions; but three states is just not enough, though it is a great start! I only hope that future DLC map expansions, which I wouldn't mind paying for, come relatively soon. It would just be disappointing if it was another ETS2 situation (when exactly is France becoming available there?)",

For example, there are local roads crossing a freeway via underpass that go from 55 to 30 and then back to 55 within what seems like 1/4 mile (either side of the interchange).   It's also missing any form of 'Reduced Speed Ahead' signs to warn you about a speed limit drop.  Even with these quirks, the game is visually quite good and very relaxing.

Good: More air travel to make it feel more alive, More traffic for the same reason, insurance system on trucks so you dont spend like 50,000 euros/dollars to fix your truck, better trailer/cargo art, Its in America so you arent swithing sides of the road or kilometers and miles, the speeding system is better because you get a speeding offence by speeding near a cop car so you cant just speed at all times until you are at a speed camera, and this one might be different for you but for you but I really perfer the truck interior and exterior designs. Finally the bad list: Smaller map and expansions are going to be DLC but I have a defense for this being that euro truck simulator is essentily an extention to euro truck simulator which was essentiaaly an extention to german truck simulator so Euro Truck Simulator 2 is 3 games put together and they are starting all over again so the map will get bigger but it might take a while. and i will add a tiny complaint about both games which is my controller has a bad plug so I crash a lot after my controller disconnects.",

            "review_text": "American Truck Simulator was developed by SCS Software as a simulator to entertain and inform players about realistic trucking experiences, as of this writing, in California, Nevada, and Arizona. The game offers a limited amount of realistic trucks and fictional companies to use and transport cargo for. But workshop mods and additions make the game much more funner.  American Truck Simulator, which will now be referred to as it's commonly known abbrevation, ATS, also offers Downloadable Content, or DLCs to improve the overall gameplay experience. Some of these DLCs may include paint job packs, wheel tuning packs, truck packs and State add-ons.  SCS Software also recently remodeled the map size to the scale of 1:20, including a new, free Arizona DLC. This offers a much better experience for players and it will take longer to finish the whole map, and ultimately, building up your trucking empire to the 'maximum'.  Anyways, I absolutely do reccommend buying ATS. If you are into driving, realism and greats scenery this is a game for you. SCS Software offers many new things to this game (referring to it's 'prequel', ETS II) which makes it much better and funner to play.",

Wide turns, traffic not moving so you can merge, cars/trucks blowing red lights and screwing up your paint job, impossible to park without blind-siding yards...it's all here. Even those pesky weigh stations.  If I could ask for more from this game, it'd be the Logs/Time Clocks, as you only get a generalized clock that tells you when you're due for your next 10hr break. It'd be great if you could get out of the truck and explore as well. Give achievements for most coffee drank in 24 hours, worst wrecks imaginable and things like that.  What it does lack that is sorely needed, however, is finer tuned steering control without the use of a gaming wheel/pedals. Both mouse and gamepad turning are tuned to how fast you are moving, and because of this, some wrecks seem unavoidable, as your wheel doesn't turn fast enough to avoid that ever-so-helpful guard rail coming up your left side when passing another vehicle because the game is tweaked to turn slow enough to keep you from flipping.",
