            "review_text": "I've played many, many hours of this in the years before it appeared on Steam and let's get one thing out of the way straight off the bat... it's not a looker. Simutrans originally came to life way back in 1997 (making it the same age as Fallout, Age of Empires and Goldeneye, to name a few utterly unrelated games that it really can't be compared to in any meaningful way) and the graphics were nothing to write home about even back then, so don't be expecting pretty pictures.  However, its lumpy graphics and clunky interface conceal a very complex, very deep game that has been under continual development and tweaking since it was turned over to its community of players more than 10 years ago.  As its name suggests, it's a transportation simulator. Specifically, it generates a map and puts you in charge of a transport company whose goal is to organise transportation of goods and passengers from wherever they are being produced to wherever they need to go. Every industry on the map will have specific suppliers that it will accept resources from, and everything that the industry produces will need to be shipped off to the next part of the chain. You need to buy vehicles to do the actual transportation, build roads, rail or waterways for the vehicles to use, and ensure that no part of your industry chain runs out of materials so that everything keeps running.   As one example, if you decide to make beer (and, really, who wouldn't) you will need to provide glass and grain to a brewery. The glass will have to come from a glassworks, which will need to be provided with coal and sand in order to produce any glass. The grain will come from a farm. The beer will then need to be shipped off to its destination. If the glassworks runs out of coal or sand it will not produce any more glass. If there is no more demand for glass (i.e. if the brewery already has plenty) it will not produce any more glass, and will stop accepting coal and sand. Your fleets of trucks for carrying coal, sand and glass will queue up at the depots and (if you're me) will back up onto main roads and cause massive gridlock that bring any other industries using the same roads grinding to a halt and bankrupt your company while you are afk.  It's very easy to fail at making profit, without resorting to exploiting silly things that haven't been very well balanced (in some variants, for example, great profit can be made by using huge freight planes/trains to transport milk from a farm to a dairy), but very satisfying when you get things right. It's also a glacially slow game at default settings, although the configuration options allow you to alter pretty much any part of the economic, landscape and time settings, so it's possible to set the game up in more ways that any one lifetime would allow you to explore.  I suspect that there's a very, very small subset of gamers who enjoy games like this. If you're one of them, and can see past the ancient look of the isometric map and the ridiculously obscure and wilfully difficult to use interface (honestly, a tutorial or even an up-to-date manual would have been nice!) then give it a go. If you're not one of those people then don't go anywhere near it - it will drive you demented.",

I'm glad I didn't look up any guides, because figuring stuff out is really fun. I even figured out how to make my own maps. You should really get this game, it's free, what do you have to lose?",
