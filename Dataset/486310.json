With Meadow, you get the ambience that Shelter, Shelter 2 and Paws delivered. The art style, as always from Might and Delight, is absolutely breathtaking. I've spent about an hour and a half now, squeaking around the map as a badger cub. I'm adorable. So are the other 20 badger cubs with me. Some of that time was spent trying to climb a hill. Why? I thought there was something on top. Spoiler; there was.  Meadow is relaxing. It's peaceful. It's a walking simulator for people who want to take a walk but also would like to interact non-verbally. It reminds me of Journey, in a way, because you'll come across people who you'll have never met- and won't ever meet again. Your brief time bonding will be characterised by scampering around and cute emotes.  I can't wait for what else they put in. Hell, maybe for those people who do want a bit of action, they'll be survival servers. I don't know. All I know is at present I'm a huge Shelter fan with a huge amount of college-stress and Meadow helps take the edge off.",

I'm a player that rages easily in a lot of competitive type games, and someone that's witnessed me show such anger gifted me this, and the Shelter games as half a joke/half therapeutic help game. I had no idea what they meant by 'It's different. And fun.'. So I installed this puppy to see what I'd get from it.  And my god they were right. This game is in all honestly, VERY, VERY relaxing. I feel kind of weird cause you basically roleplay as an animal, and you develop quick friendships with using nothing but emotes and animal calls, and you have a vast world to explore either by yourself, or with said newfound friends. There is no narrative, no real end goal, no competition, nothing.  I've felt like a complete dork and a little embarrassed, having chuckled so many times at certain situations ive been put in. You don't know who's behind the animal you befriend, and the game doesn't exactly WANT you to know. Just...plops you into a world, with minimal communication besides raw emotions via symbols. It doesn't matter what language you speak. I think this is a great game for those who want to relax, and create your own stories that you will surely remember.   Hell. Let your kids play this game if you got any. It's a fun little experience for those who want a change of scenery.",

In The Meadow By masterseth2003  In the meadow, where the animals play, where the sun shines bright all day, and there's no such thing as 'predator' or 'prey.' Things are so much better that way.  Foxes, deer, and rabbits galore, that's just three, but there's so much more. Eagles in the sky, and frogs on the shore, such, are the things that i adore.  The music, a peaceful tune, keeps people from leaving too soon. Light, from a mystical rune, reflects, the calm, relaxing tune.  The place where animals frolic all day, and happiness is seen every which way. Just $2.99, that's not much to pay, to go In The Meadow, where the animals play.  Only this, can describe a game, such as this one.",

            "review_text": "My Experience in Meadow was quite intriguing. I started my adventure just as a baby badger, wandering cluelessly around learning my 'new life'. Eventually I run into my first social encounter; a Baby Lynx, who happily greets me. I do the same.  Little did I know I would spend so much time with my new Lynx buddy, on epic adventures around the vast Meadow world. We swiftly ran across the Great Plains, Explored Diamond caves, went swimming in a underground Lake, Destroyed massive boulders with sheer barking power (or mews...), Jumped off cliffs and landed without a single injury, and Discovered the Edge of the WORLD! But, all Great things must come to an end. When me and my Lynx friend discovered a pack of Baby Badgers (A.K.A. Newcomers), we greeted them and pranced around. But my Lynx friend started crying, I did not know what to do, I asked 'why' countless times. But in just seconds, dark grey clouds enshrouded the Lynx and when the dust cleared; Baby Lynx was GONE... My friend... My only Friend...  Honestly, I felt like I built a Real Connection with Baby Lynx. Despite there being no chat, it's amazing how social you can be with just emotes alone, you build strong bonds without even realizing it.  I think a lesson may be learned from this. Make the best with what, or rather, WHO you have because you'll never know when it may be the last time you see them again. Either that, or make sure to make friends with an Ninja Lynx that dissapears instantly in smoke...   But in all seriousness, I loved my first experience with Meadow. It's a very casual and friendly game. I ENCOURAGE YOU to buy this game if you Love animals or if you're a hardcore gamer. Why hardcore gamer? Well because I believe this is a nice game to unwind after playing a competative game, it would help you relax, calm down, and maybe make a few unknown friends! But if they game doesn't really meet your kind of style, it's OK to refund, atleast you tried.   10/10 Would be friends with Ninja Lynx again",

            "review_text": "This game is something else. If you aren't good at making your own fun, if you require a more linear game, if you hate exploring or gathering or could care less about being social, this game is not for you. The other Shelter games (including Paws, which doesn't have 'Shelter' in the title but is included in the lineup) are singleplayer and fairly linear (even Shelter 2 has a beginning and an end) so you'll be perfectly satisfied. This game is not a cheaper version of the other Shelter games. Honestly, if you want a beautiful, emotional, mothering game then PLEASE buy one of the other games, they are amazing and worth the money. This game is a reward for fans of the Shelter series who already own the other games and you can get the fullest out of it if you buy the others, see it as a reward for fans of the series and less as a 'pay-to-win' game.   This game is for fans of the animals, graphics and lovely music of the Shelter games that long for something quiet, relaxing and social. It's for people who are tired of swearing and bullying in multiplayer games and just want to have fun with other people in a very simple, rudimentary way. It's for the people who can enjoy something simple, something special, who can enjoy a game of puffball soccer or who-can-pop-the-most-puff-mushrooms, or who just want to unwind after work.   It is said that this game lacks features, and that's totally untrue. There's a big, beautiful world to explore, there are TONS of emotes and skins to unlock (for each animal, too), there are lots of animals to choose from, there is a rudimentary but pleasing form of communication (little animal pictograms) and there are people to play with. If you use what's given to you instead of complaining about everything this game isn't, then you will have a good time. Relax, and enjoy: you don't need to keep looking over your shoulder to see if that eagle is going to murder you or your loved ones.  9/10, fully recommended but it's not for everyone.  Note: I haven't experienced a grain of lag in this game, and my computer isn't particularly high-end (just a Mac desktop). Your computer might, but they are trying to fix the lag so it's your choice to either risk it or wait and see if it's fixed.",

            "review_text": "I love these types of multiplayer games. It's relaxing and you don't know who you're sharing a moment with, which is as much a blessing as it is a curse. If you need a break from action to clear your mind and make some friends, this is a great game for you. Don't expect any survival elements, just a relaxing experience full of adventure.  If you're curious on an encounter you might have, let me tell you about my amazing adventure:  I entered the world as a frog, having been shown the basics of the game while still a badger cub, I decided to explore the world on my own. While I did find various treasures, I couldn't unlock the rune stones on my own. With nobody near me, I decided it best to just lay by a stone and wait. After a few minutes I checked the map and noticed a lone blip near-by. I figured they would be having the same lonely troubles as me and rushed to meet them. I stumbled across a rabbit and we greeted eachother before I led them to the two runes. He followed me as I attempted to meet up with some other animals, having realized the importance of a group. The rabbit, I called him Robbs, and I joined a rather full group and had a great time exploring. Robbs and my unlockabes were fairly synced, so we got our emotes and skins at the same time. Our signature emote was the tongue-out one, which we would sometimes flash at eachother. When the skin change came, I was a little nervous because I was the only frog in the group, so it wasn't that bad that I changed to red, but there were now two white rabbits in the group, so it was a bit difficult to keep track of Robbs. When it came time to swim, I was faster than Robbs, but made sure to never leave him behind and he returned the favor on land, always being sure I didn't lag behind the group. We even split off from the group to gather a gem and some flowers before running back. All in all, I had an amazing experience and was sad when the next skin change came and Robbs bid us farewell. I don't think I'll ever meet someone as great as that bunny and it'll be hard to use the tongue emote again.  If you're out there my white, cotton-tailed friend, know that you showed this little, red frog an amazing experience that she won't forget. :P",

I didn't go in this expecting anything more than a forum game - or rather, some social game with interactions, and hoenstly, that's all it is. It's cute, and meeting others and following them around let me unwind. It's well worth it's price tag, as long as you know what it is going in, and it's very simple.  However, if you're looking for a Shelter game, this is not one. It is TIED to that series, yes, and it is in the same universe, but this is NOT in *any* way the same as the Shelter games. I'm giving this a recommendation if only because I think it's a step in the right direction - a milestone in the way to making a true multiplayer Shelter game. The emotes are definately a step in the right direction, though their use is a little bit annoying. The controls are wobbly, but I didn't expect them to be any better to be frankly honest.  I want to support this company, because I know what they've done before, and I know that, with support, they could make something absolutely stunning. This is not a stunning game, it feels unfinished, something they had planned to make a shelter game and then realised it was far too social, far too friendly, to truly make it as oddly grim as the Shelter games can be.  This is a forum game, and as a forum game? It's worth the price, if only JUST.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR - You will highly enjoy it if you like exploration and collecting things to unlock more things. You'll enjoy it even more if you meet up with other players or bring your friends!  Full Review  Meadow is fantastic and refreshing (I can't believe it's only $3). I literally would have paid $29.99 for this game, or at least $19.99.  I have a lot of great things to say about this game. As usual, it is a marvelous illustration of artwork, both in audio and visual, brought to you by some incredibly talented developers. These guys are artists, not big game developers, yet they have brought us multiple games that each have very positive reviews. That says something about the content these guys put out there for us to enjoy. It's incredible and worth spreading the word about.  There is no reason at all that this title should ever receive a negative review. The few negative reviews I have seen are people complaining about not being able to type in a global chat, having to own previous titles by Might and Delight to unlock certain animals, the eagle not having as many emoticons as other animals, and optimization (which isn't a problem unless you have a crappy processor - you need at least 2.6 GHz). These reviews are unfair, in my opinion, and I'll tell you why I feel this way:  First off, not having a chat box in the game is one of the most interesting things about Meadow. The developers have implemented a system of communication using nicely illustrated emoticons (expressive and directional). These emoticons have worked perfectly for players who are patient and willing to learn how they are best used to communicate with other players. Adding a global chat into the game would completely ruin the experience. The emoticons would be pointless and there would be more bickering in chat than there would be gameplay. Not to mention, the entire atmosphere of the game would be different. Everyone is so friendly and helpful in Meadow because they are strongly encouraged to explore together, and they do this without any biasedness. If there was a global chat, players would divide into groups of friends, leaving anyone not apart of that group feeling left out or intrusive. Meaning, ultimately, the atsmophere would feel less welcoming. Also, trying to hunt for runestones and puzzle pieces would be less fun/challenging if people were calling out locations.  Secondly, this is a $3 game. For $3, you get a massive wilderness to explore with other online players, and four different animals (baby badger, rabbit, frog, and goat) with dozens of skins and emotes. That seems like a really good bargain to me. I don't think it's fair that people should complain about having to purchase other titles in order to unlock animals like the adult badger, adult lynx, baby lynx, and baby bear. Each of these animals has their own story, and I think players should experience their stories before being able to play them in Meadow. These animals are meant to be bonuses for people who own their previous games, Shelter, Shelter 2, and Paws: A Shelter 2 Game (seriously, I felt like it was a really nice extra for having already owned their previous games, like the devs were thanking us for supporting them). These games are fantastic, and honestly, they aren't really that expensive on the Steam store. So the fact that people are complaining about having to buy other games if they don't already own them, is kind of petty. Might and Delight are wonderful and talented developers, and if you enjoy this game enough to want to unlock other species, then you should be glad to support them by purchasing their other titles. Hopefully the increase in sales will encourage Might and Delight to add more into Meadow in terms of other playable animals, emoticons, actions, etc.  Finally, the eagle complaints have got to stop! Guys, come on. The eagle is not broken, and it does not need to be 'fixed.' If the eagles were given the same directional emoticons as other animals, then eagle players would just fly around and look for runestones and then lead other players directly to runestones, which completely defeats the purpose of the game! Also, it wouldn't be fair to let eagles collect essence and puzzle pieces because they would have a completely unfair advantage over other players who are also collecting essence to make it onto the leaderboards.  If anything could be changed or added to the game, I would suggest a quick intro or tutorial for first time players. You really have to explore and learn as you go, but a lot of players seem to get confused because the objective of the game may not be clear to them. Because of this, I thought I would throw in a few tips that I've learned since I started playing Meadow:  1.) You can change animals by going to The Den/Main Menu and actually clicking on the animals sleeping in the background. A lot of people had a hard time figuring this out, so I thought it should be the first tip. 2.) You can view other player's names by pressing the right Alt button on your keyboard. You can change this key in your control settings. I use E because it's easier to press. 3.) You can hit P to open your Puzzle Progress. Pink puzzle pieces reward you with essence and help you unlock new emoticons, blue crystals reward you with new skins for the animal you're currently playing, and yellow crystals help you unlock new playable animals. 4.) You can hit M to look at the map, which is more like a radar. It shows you the center tree, and all of the white icons indicate other online players. Generally it's a good idea to run to a cluster of players. Exploring alone is fun, but exploring with others is a whole new experience! 5.) If you press your middle mouse button, you can use your senses to see nearby players. 6.) Runestones are black obelisks that can be unlocked with two or more players. The symbols indicate what you need in order to open the runestone. Runestones contain blue or yellow crystals. It's worth exploring with a group so that you can unlock runestones. 7.) You can use F to auto walk forward, and R to toggle autorun (pair these together for the best results, imo).  Another suggestion that I think would satiate the community's desire to contact the players they meet within the game is to allow your servers to send info to Steam so that we can Shift+Tab and look at the 'View Players' list. We can already see the names of the players we are playing with, but trying to find them on Steam can be a challenge if their name is more common. It would be easier if we could look under 'View Players' or our 'Recent Players,' which derives from the 'View Players,' list.  This game truly is relaxing and a world of fun. I really hope that Might and Delight continues to add more content. Perhaps they will expand the world into more biomes for us to explore and add new unlockable characters/skins/emotes. My fingers are crossed for foxes and porcupines in the future of Meadow! Thank you so much for such a pleasant experience, Might and Delight!

It's quiet. It's relaxing. It's kinda pretty in it's own cloth-store kind of way. And I enjoyed exploring and unlocking new things.  The game is only running at 15-20fps, though, so that's brutally slow. I'm not sure why the game is bogged down but I'm hoping the devs fix it. It's somewhat tolerable here only becasue the game is simple enough that the low frame rate doesn't really affect much. Yes, it's noticable. Yes, it get in the way.. but it's tolerable in short bursts.   If you're thinking of getting this game and are reading reviews, I assume you're somewhat interested and informed on the title already. My personal opinion is that if you've made it this far, it's worth picking up. Heck, you have 2 hours to request a refund and you'll know in the first 15-20 minutes if it's worth keeping in your library.

            "review_text": "  It's a 'forum in game's clothing'. Meadow has a wonderful map, the biggest one yet in any of the Shelter games, and you can explore it at your heart's content. You don't need to eat, you don't need to drink, you don't need to protect your cubs or fight for them.  This is also an online experience. There's no singleplayer, there are three different servers with three groves each where you can choose to hang out. Whether alone or with friends, Meadow makes for a unique experience you may or may not enjoy depending on your personal tastes.  Do you prefer a game with quests and npcs basically telling you to fetch their hat? Nope, not for you.  Do you enjoy a story-driven experience with a lot of plot? Nope, not here.  Do you want to roleplay in text chat? Absolutely not.  Meadow allows you to choose from a set of animals (which animals you have will depend on what you own from the Shelter catalogue) and each of them has its own quirks, skins and emotes. That's right, emotes. Communication happens through the good old non-verbal channel: you can express your thoughts and objectives through a set of emotes. Body language and calling out is also a part of how you can express yourself.  After all, you're playing as an animal and that's exactly how animals communicate, and really, you don't need a text chat to say hi when you've got an adorable little emote just there. Personally this is one of the features I enjoy the most and I think that not having a text chat available really improves the experience, along with the fact that there's no tutorial. Tutorial ruins the immersion sometimes and immersion is what you need to enjoy this game to the fullest, you learn how to play by simply playing.  After all this is an unique experience. If you're looking for in-depth gameplay or complex plots then Meadow simply isn't your cup of tea and you can move along. If you've played 'The Endless Forest' before you'll probably enjoy Meadow as well.  Then, on a side note: M&amp;D is a great team of developers. For just 2,99 there's a nice amount of content, and more to come~",

Now I can agree with the few that say it can get boring as after you've worked to unlock everything there really isn't much to do anymore; save for enjoying the scenery and amazing art design the Shelter series is known for. The music is perfect and it's nice to have on in the background or to just sit by a fire with friends.

The other downs for me gets cancelled out because it would take away what's unique about the game.   Every time I play this, my brother always says, 'So...you're just collecting stuff. And all those animals are other people who have bought the game.' He's so dumbfounded at how such a game can be fun to me and a whole ton of other people. It's definitely not the game for anyone. I do wonder what I'll do once I collect everything and get all the achievements...but that's for the future me to find out. Maybe add more activities to do like hunting and surviving but just not killing each other? xD  PS.
