            "review_text": "Omnibus is a good game, that would be better if with tighter mechanics. I get the joke of having wonky physics or a bus that easily flips over, but you're going to spend a lot of time in air not playing the game and landing upside down to start the level over from instant death. The joke wears thin quickly.  The joke of odd physics is way funnier when something looks initially real, or when something is going right like racing well in Burnout only to crash into a million pieces. The graphics here are Jaguar level and the bus is too unwieldy to feel like you're doing well.  Imagine if rather than being qwop/happy wheels inspired this game played with the tightness of controls Rocket League has. The levels could be scaled to be harder and you'd have a more fun game, one that was overall less frustrating.  Omnibus is still a good game though. It's really varied in terms of level type, and the final boss even has you use all the basic mechanics to beat the game (something that many modern games forget to do.) You can also skip any level which is nice if you get fed up. I beat the game at 5 hours skipping 2 levels.  I'd really like them to take another shot with this concept. Take the silliness out of the controls and put it into more of their inventive level ideas!",

This game is a lot of fun, but it becomes really frustrating if you try to do some challanging stuff. Also, this game taught me what to do if I was driving a bus, which has no brakes.  I give it 9 bumbers out of 10, yes you hit that many bumbers in this game.  ",
