            "review_text": "I very much wanted to like this game. I have enjoyed text-based adventures in the past, and I hoped that this would be a fun way to role-play as my own created hero. Right off the bat, the game doesn't really do anything to explain how it works, or what you are suppose to be doing. So with little direction, I created my character and am offered to perform one of ten actions for the 'turn'. The first action I saw was 'go on patrol' (or something similar), so I went ahead and tried it. I saw nothing. So I tried it again. Still nothing to respond to. So I went and used the training option for a few rounds to build up more points to spend on stats/traits/powers for my character. Then I noticed a button to track down villains. So I spent TEN TURNS trying to track down a single opponent at level 1. Finally, I managed to find them and start a battle. Unfortunately, this is where it got even more confusing. The game battles are determined by 'seeds' which seem to be the total offensive 'rolls' of the attacker pitted against the total defensive rolls of the one being attacked. If you score high enough offensively, you hit; or vice versa for the defending hero/villain. There are several things that affect rolls such as traits, positioning, move accuracy, stats, and various other factors. But the problem here is that I honestly have yet to figure out what dictates a hit, or a dodge, or a reduced impact, or anything else. It seems to cryptic. One time I actually managed to roll a 421 defensively against a roll of 24 from the attacker, and I still got hit for full damage. It simply doesn't make sense to me.  Now all of this could simply be chalked up to me simply not understanding the game fully, but there is NO EXCUSE for my next experience. I made a new character just to test patrols, and gave him balanced stats. I ran him on patrol over 150 times and never found ANYTHING. My character went depressed from lack of motivation from doing nothing, and that results in a gameover. That was when I decided to quit before I hit two hours so that I could refund the game. Its just poorly done.  Pro's ------- -You can create a custom hero from a large selection of portraits and move-types  -Seemed to run fine  Con's ------- -Confusing layout -Unrealisticly low chance of discovering crimes (at least during the early phase of the game) -Poor explainations of core game mechanics -Sloppy combat text descriptions - It just seems as if it presumes to much.  (I have removed the no audio Con. In all fairness, BGM or Clicker audio is not required by any means for a text-based game to be enjoyable)  _____  Update: Take this review with a grain of salt, honestly. I jumped in and purchased the game having been a moderate fan of text games (The Dark Room on IOS, for example), and I was even more motivated by my love for comicbook fiction. After reading some feedback I do realize now that perhaps I would have had a more enjoyable experience had I started a hero at a higher tier so that I could handle and possibly even encounter more villains. But I am sure that the limitations put in place by the lower-ranked hero system are not intentional as it seems to negate any sort of drive to start from the bottom and work your way up; whats a good comic without an origin story?",

I REALLY LOVE THIS DEVELOPER, TEW 2013 and WMMA 3 and 4, are so damn good. Unfortunately this isn't as well off. It isn't bad by any means, but it could get boring for most players as you play for a couple hours. Please don't pay $19.99 for this game. It isn't worth it. I paid $6.99 and I think that is a good enough price to play this game. Also check out the above greydogsoftware games, you won't regret it.",

The $20 they ask is NOT worth it you might as well buy 2 copies of CSGO for that n pass it out to a friend.. it is a GREAT $5 game but it is robbery at $19.99   2/10 (would be 6/10 if they didnt rob people at $19.99 for a single player MUD style game)",

            "review_text": "The only bad point this game has is not being able to play as a villain. Other than that, the game's a grindfest (something I don't mind as long as the grind doesn't feel tedious,) and also a tool to create your own universes and fill them with heroes and villains. Sure, the creative process takes time, but once you're done getting the right pictures, stats and powers, and crafting the world to your liking, you could play any character of that universe - or try your luck as a 'nobody' hero who's just starting out.  One other point that may be seen as a flaw is that NPC heroes/villains don't level up/down as the player does, but this may be a good thing - Since balancing the number of heroes and villains is hard, and villains are more often than not in the losing end of a battle, then the game could end up being a world populated by invincible heroes beating up weaksauce villains.  I know some will say that the whole 'psychological profile' part of the game is broken and impossible to play with, but that is not true. Game mechanics take some time to figure out, but once you do, you'll be going up in the heroic ranks easily, and be able to keep your hero's social/mental state outside the 'you lose' zone. True, sometimes a bad choice can screw you over but no death is permanent in the game (at least for the player - NPCs can and will die a lot if you set deaths to be frequent) and if your character is not cutting it, then you could always try a different approach, or use the in-game editor to fix your character up. Yes, it's still cheating if it's a single-player game, but the important part of that equation is 'single player game.'  This game is a game that will give countless hours of fun if you are into the kind of games it is, doesn't come in small pieces you have to buy separately, and has a built-in editor. Too bad I won't be able to play the villains I create.",
