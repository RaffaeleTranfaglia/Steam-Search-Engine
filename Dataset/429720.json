The only thing you need to know is make sure the game is installed to the C: drive!  I have completed all the Silent Hill games,  Resident Evils, Fatal Frames, Condemneds, F.E.A.Rs, Amnesia, Penumbra, Outlast,  and countless other horrors. IMSCARED does something none of these could ever do. It achieved the ultimate goal of a horror game, it went further than just being a game. It was a real, paranoia induced horror experience. I'd write an in depth piece but that would just ruin the experience for you! If you love horror at all, YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS!   Be warned though. It IS watching you.",

The relatively spoiler free version of the gameis that you have to escape from the nightmare you've been put in. The graphics are great at selling the otherworldly atmosphere and the sound design is also super creepy. It uses both jump scares and atmosphere versus relying solely on jump scares, making it a winner in my book. My only real complaint is that sometimes the puzzles get to be too obtuse. Most of them are good brain teasers, but some require seriously out of the box thinking. A bit too much for my tastes.  Still, the atmosphere and creativity at play here is great and worth checking out. Like I said, this is a game that is beter left unspoiled, which is why I've been so vague. With the cheap asking price, you could do a lot worse than this.",

There may be horror games with better graphics, better mechanics and yes less bugs (I got stuck on some walls at some point) but never has a game made me feel like I am feeling right now.

            "review_text": "imscared: a pixelated nightmare or maybe its just imscared the freeware version is called pixelated but the steam version is just imscared in my library   because this is one of those games the obligatory twisty twist heres a short review; dont buy it. you can avert your gaze now and play the freeware version instead of this which i havent actually played but its probably this but shorter and freer so just play that if you want some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in twists. going back to the actual review imscared is a walking simulator horror game where you solve all of your problems by walking and picking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up while the game tries to scare you except its not scary and pulls some pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t near the end of the game. maybe im horror desensitized now considering i beat amnesia and that wasnt scary but whatever write your own review â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ juggler. im sure there are better and scarier walking simulators out there for free or not.   now that everyone who who wants to keep their imscared virginity gone i can safely talk about the only reason this game has any attention whatsoever which is the twist. the game does this meta â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ which is summed up as what if game was alive and because game is life the game interacts with your computer in a meta way which sounds interesting. the game pushes this to the limit of intentionally crashing and sometimes playing a sound effect while youre out of game once it does and adding/editing text files in an imscared folder. truly my fear has reached a zenith unknown by sentient beings. this feature is seriously what has propelled this game into any sort of spotlight and its poorly utilized every time it gets dragged up from the depths of meta hell. like for real there are two things this game uses the meta â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for: text files and a single semi jumpscare thing and the text files are all puzzles that suck â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. so does the jumpscare but whatever. the game also tries to tell its story or some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ via those text files in cryptic and mostly uninteresting fluff paragraphs to go along with the stupid puzzles. i guess thats the extent of the meta â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as well as the game crashing when you die. if you are buying this game thinking it is some sort of superb fourth wall adventure you are wrong. this game is bad. i seriously wish i could write more about the meta â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but i cant because its just so not there. all of the puzzles with meta are seriously just you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing with text files and if that sounds fun â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you.   the gameplay is walking simulator. i am so glad walking simulator has become a legitimate genre on steam. the entire concept of walking simulator is ridiculous and yet omnipresent among â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games. this is one of those games. the entire game is just walking around and away from enemies and pressing e to pick stuff up or interact with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because the rest of the game is not scary horror. its basically a worse version of amnesia in like everything. ive already said it before but every single puzzle is just finding the right thing to press e on or the sequence of things to press e on. thats it. that and the meta â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ which i said before. more importantly though the game pulls some serious asspull near the end where it actually requires you to have all achievements to progress while also not giving you any hints on what those achievements are. most of these achievements are self explanatory but there are definitely a few that could be easily missed and i missed three on the first playthrough plus theres one thats almost impossible without a guide which i used. i can only assume its trying to push the meta adventure envelope here too except instead of fostering a community of people who explore the game like yume nikki it makes everyone go look up a walkthrough on youtube to avoid potentially hours of backtracking through â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ youve already been through to find a stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥ achivement for this stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. unlike yume nikki this game has nothing interesting to find or explore so i dont know what the dev was doing with that. and yeah you do have to backtrack for all of them all of them are based on pressing e on things or looking at â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   anyway the horror. the horror is horrible. life is horrible and so is this game. the horror seems to be based on the sort of hidden agreement you might get a jumpscare sometimes and that incredibly low visibility plus being chased equals horror. like im not even joking about how little you can see there is an impenetrable wall of fog forever surrounding the player almost all of the time. it varies in distance but still it seems to exist only so the player gets super spooked when the monster is five feet in front of them before they see it. the game also enjoys being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing loud as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for most jumpscares and other â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ which makes me more annoyed than scared because this game has caused me slight physical pain instead of horror. its really just not scary and none of the gimmicky â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it does makes it scary.   the graphics in particular help absolutely nothing about this game. yeah its a pixelated nightmare i know but was the title not changed. running from a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in pixel face like come on son. the games environments look decent enough but none of them were scary which is a problem when this game is betting every single farm on horror. the game gets much worse in the second half when the face thing chasing you suddenly and inexplicably transforms into a girl thing chasing you which they actually manage to make more hot than scary im not even joking. this is a mostly featureless pixelated white thing. if you ever do play this game to the second part pretend to make johnny bravo advances on the ghost girl so that the game crashes when you touch her and you dont have to play anymore. for real though dont play this game. for real again this game isnt scary looking ever.   then we get to the sound. you know i think that this game actually did the ambience sort of well. it had a sort of vintage low quality freaky record player approach that worked pretty good and was different from the generic whisper/cave sound/whatever that ive found in like every other horror game. the sound effects though. the sound effects were alright except for the ones that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kill your ears holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ why. sometimes the game decides it is in the best interests of all parties involved to emit a piercing ear destroying sound wave for reasons i assume are loud = scary. its laughably bad especially when you finally get to the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in end of the game and the game pulls this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ repeatedly to the point where i was actually laughing every time it occurred because of how ridiculous it is. like holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ kill me now. anyway im done with the review im not talking about the plot because thats on life support so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you heres a conclusion.   for a game that probably totes how innovative it is for breaking the fourth wall the pixel â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics and boring walking simulator gameplay say otherwise. it takes no leaps in game design or anything else that would make it truly remarkable. its not even fun as a non horror game. its not even fun as a horror game. its just not fun. it seems every gameplay mechanic was built to accentuate the horror instead of being good in its own right like what amnesia tried to do with its puzzles. i wont say amnesia went further than tried though. thus enjoyment of the game entirely depends on how much of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you are and how much you enjoy being scared. if you are a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who enjoys being scared just play amnesia anyway.",
