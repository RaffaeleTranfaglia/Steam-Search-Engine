I seriously didn't expect such a good game when I decided to give it a try, without knowledge about the game at all, with the excepting that it was a puzzle platformer.  It is in my opinion one of the most overlooked indie games I have played, that totally deserves more attention from puzzle platformer fans.  Overall, very good game.",

            "review_text": "And Yet It Moves is an indie puzzle-platformer, released back when indie puzzle-platformers weren't a commodity yet.  The mechanisms are simple: navigate levels by running, (weakly) jumping and, more importantly, by rotating the level around you. Rotations are made by steps of 90° or 180°. You have to be careful though, because you can only fall from so high before getting crushed to death in the process. And you keep your momentum even after rotating, so don't expect to cheat death by a last-minute rotation.   You will suffer tens or hundreds of deaths, but AYIM remains causal and mostly frustration-free, thanks to infinite lifes and the most generous distribution of checkpoints to ever grace a video game. Which also makes the gotcha-unfair kind of deaths much more tolerable than in other games.  The graphics are made of paper collages and give AYIM a look that remains unique and distinct, even all these years after its release. I sometimes wished for more variety though, as there only are 4 or so 'themes'.  'Music' is made of blip-bloop noisy soundscapes, which works very well but, again, more variety would have been welcome.  Beating the game should take about two hours, and I think that's about tight: the end came just before it would have started getting too repetitive. If you're so inclinded, various modes (speed runs, ...) are available to add replayability, but I think most people will be content to just play through this relatively basic game once.  Overall, AYIM has enough personality to warrant a recommendation. It's certainly much better than what I expected from the 'mixed' Steam user reviews. Because it was offered in several bundles, it lies unplayed in many people's backlog. If that's your case, I encourage you to give it a try. I think it's good enough to recommend a purchase, but there's no question that it's a bit short to justify the non-sale price tag.",

You're not likely to revisit it for years to come, and you'll beat it in a day or two, but And Yet It Moves is a relaxing and simply fun title that's worth picking up if you see it in a bundle or on sale for very cheap.",

Thus the game does feel a bit short. I prefer to play this with a controller as it feels more natural for a platformer style game (I didn't play much Jazz Jackrabbit or Commander Keen back in the day) and the trigger buttons are perfect for the rotation mechanic. The puzzles aren't too hard and are all the visual style puzzles that don’t require an explanation. The momentum mechanic is difficult to get used to as it's very easy to pick up too much speed and not be able to land without breaking apart but it is a nice change from the standard 'your character can only jump an x distance before dying'. I recommend this game as a casual game to relax with for a short sitting as that's how I feel it was meant to be played.",

Because the levels are comprised of ripped and torn up paper, and even your character is paper, it looks a lot different to almost every game out there, even now, several years after its release, considering a lot of indie games go for the 8-bit look.   This is a very fun game, but it still comes with moments of frustration. The tilting of the screen to move between areas is done pretty well I thought, but there are stages where your timing and approach need to be more than exact, and it can get frustrating dying 20+ times in a row. While it does get repetitive, you're basically doing the same thing the entire game, just walking and rotating the level, it does look really cool and makes for a different game world.   It's a nice little indie game that you can lose yourself in for a bit. If you haven't played it, pick it up, maybe when it's on sale, and give it a go. 7/10",

This game is indie because it's a bunch of torn up paper, like the paper bags you used to get your groceries in before you started using canvas bags to be even more sustainable, and especially before someone told you that paper bags actually cause more pollution than plastic bags because they take more energy to produce. And the sound your character makes when he dies is a sort of 'swoosh' sound that some guy makes with his mouth, which is totally indie. In any case this game is pretty great and if you're high because you got some dank nugs, this will either be a great experience or far too complex. Warning: game has bats. Hunter S.

            "review_text": "You probably remember feeling frustrated playing some platformers when you were younger; there was always a platform outside of reach, really high up, and you had no idea how you could reach it. You wanted to change the direction of gravity and just GET THERE. Well, 'And Yet it Moves' is an indie platformer with the goal of satiating that appetite for gravity-redirection. It's a simple concept: let the player change the direction of gravity at will, so he can reach those places.     The Good:    * Very interesting graphical style. Everything is handmade and polished with love.  * Innovative gameplay mechanic: you rotate the screen 90 or 180 degrees in either direction, which affects the direction of gravity and the screen rotates so that 'down' is always at the bottom of your screen.  * Relaxing atmosphere. The music is soft and mellow, but does get repetitive after some time.     The Bad:    * The 'genre' of this game is not a platformer as some reviewers might suggest. The genre is 'maze navigation,' and that is unfortunately not a type of game that I personally enjoy.  * I feel like the default controls for rotating the screen are backwards. The right arrow-key should turn the maze clockwise, not anti-clockwise. Fortunately these can be changed in the options menu.  * The camera sometimes zooms very close into the player's avatar (for no reason?) which is VERY FRUSTRATING for a maze-navigation game. It inhibits the player from seeing obstacles from a longer distance.  * The game has 'gotcha' deaths. For example, a random floor may break out from underneath you and kill you. This is not the worst thing given the game's high frequency of save points, but it's still frustrating to suddenly die when you think you're just chillin'.    The Ugly:    * Just not very fun in general. It took me about 30 minutes of playtime to realize this game just wasn't for me.I got to chapter 2, level 2 before I got bored. (There are 3 chapters of about 4 levels each).  * After the 'rotate the world' gimmick fades off, the game is essentially a 'avoid fall damage' simulator. You will try getting around (over?) very simple objects many, many, many times per level without falling to your death. Fall damage is calculated very frustratingly and mysteriously. Because the world rotates around your player, it makes it confusing why your avatar dies after falling from what is realistically only one foot off the ground.    The Verdict:    And Yet it Moves is exactly the reason indie games are indie games: a major developer would have never risked funding a game with this unique gameplay mechanic. I really apprecaite the game for its innovation and risk-taking, but as it turns out, the major developers would have been right not to fund a game like this: rotating the world is simply a gimmick and does not add to the appeal of an otherwise interestingly-looking game. Part of the issue is genre: it simply does not work as a quasi-platformer. I would have liked to see the developer try for a lemmings-style game, or a tower-defense where the creeps always fall 'down' and sending one group to a danger zone my cause another group to drop into where you defenses are weaker. We can be glad that future developers can learn what NOT to do from this game.",

Some recognition should be made for them not going down the 'Retro pixel' route that most talentless developers at the bottom of the development ladder take. Instead they decided to attempt actual art, despite being talentless. A bold move which results in predictable disaster.   Shoddy scanned in textures and the most abysmal hand drawn art that makes Napoleon Dynamite look like Leonardo DaVinci assault your eyes in this monsterpiece. I actually had to rinse my eyes out at a chemical spill sink.   Gameplay is woeful. It's a bland platformer with a level rotation mechanic (this is meant to differentiate it from other platformers, but many of those have already tried this). They're not making platformers better, they're making gaming worse. The art is so poor quality it's really hard to control the gameplay because it's distracting.  Technical aspects also plague this game - no 4K support, overscan on fullscreen rendering the game unplayable unless you go into windowed mode if you own a monitor released this decade - it's hard to say if there are any other issues because the graphics are just that bad. I'd rather throw my PC out than play this abomination again.",

Within fifteen minutes you will grasp and understand the small amount of amusement this game offers, while at the same time growing tired of playing it with each passing minute. It is a lesson in poor game design and lack of creativity. There are barely any sounds nor music. There is no charm, fun, creativity, nor intrigue. And Yet It Moves is another independent showcasing of what game development should steer clear from. It is a cheap, short, flat, unexciting, unexceptional, deficient attempt at game design. There is nothing to see nor experience here. It is a freeware game disguised with an exorbitant asking price from developers who obviously lack shame and humility. And Yet It Moves is inadequate in every fathomable way, and it exemplifies everything that gaming should not be about. There is no actual game content and no game play. It is self-conceited to make up for all of its failures and shortcomings.  And Yet It Moves is mediocre.",
