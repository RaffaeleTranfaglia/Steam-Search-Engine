    "description": "B.U.T.T.O.N. is a physical party game for 2-8 players. Step back away from the computer, race to the keyboard/controllers through physical space, and do whatever it takes to win (or to avoid losing). Act like a monkey, jump up and down, wrestle over the keyboard/controllers, cheat your competitors, and above all, expect the unexpected.",

I prefer when playing with other people to play with Xbox 360 Controllers since they are alot easier to play with and you dont have to worry so much about braking them. The game is very simple, you read what is on the screen and do it accordingly then you get pushed to push the button that you are assigned to multiple times or not at all. It can be rewarding and frustrating to play with friends who cheat and try to throw off your character by pushing your button. The game is good but can get old really fast when it says the same thing in a different way a couple times. I recommend this game to people that have friends or want to do something different with their better halves. Its simple and fun, but frustratingly maddening all at the same time.",

This game gets boring easily (put it down after 15 minutes) and its not often you find 8 people in your study so the lack of multi machine multiplayer is dissapointing. This is a game that would be better suited for the WII but even then wouldnt be worth anything.",
