They just like casual crap' - but if you look at my steam profile you'll see I have hundreds of hours game time in MANY games - from casual to rpg to MANY others.  But about this game - yes, all the characters are females in relatively revealing clothing, and yes their cries when they're hit are suggestive. Personally, I do turn off the voices - It's not that I think it's bad, or even 'inappropriate' - I just don't need it.  I actually REALLY like the designs of the characters - what's wrong with being a good looking woman in sexy clothing?  'But they're just ♥♥♥♥s! They're asking for it!' no.. no they're not.. that's a VERY sexist way of thinking. For many women, feeling 'sexy' is actually empowering and shows that she has CONFIDENCE in herself. It's how they BEHAVE that determines a '♥♥♥♥'. But that's a whole nother discussion for another time.  The art is beautiful and very well done, and I love the new backgrounds that are changing as you go up in the realms.  This is a good clicker game, and I see updates are going on to help improve and balance the gameplay. I really appreciate that. It shows the creator really gives a damn.  The only thing I could possibly say is one downfall for me? I'd love it if there were some sexy bishounen male characters that would pop up from time to time. Yes, the main target audience for this game IS men - but there will be girls who play too. And if men think that they're allowed to oggle hot women, they shouldn't be uncomfortable with women oggling hot men too!",

Also, it's dangerous to go alone, take this tissue-pack (For nosebleed of course xD)  Sakura clicker, you must know the other games.. right? It's not much different, except this one doesn't really have a conversation But they have some voice act for the girls (monster girls in case you didn't notice) Even though it's only voicegasm-act There's nothing much things to do except clicking until your mouse broke and you win  'Also included is 800+ moans as you defeat the monsters.' The game description said it already It's like steam monster clicker! But better plot and better reward xD  TL;DR If you want to play clicker game with a real plot This is it! This is the game!

And I started playing the game just to see anime girl boobs. But I kept playing for the actualy gameplay.  The concept is simple: you click to collect gold, you upgrade your characters, and you keep doing that. But wow. I'm surprised at how many characters there are, both monsters and allies. You can also go up to an extremely high number of gold. Eventually, you can 'rebirth'. Which you basically just start over with special currency that you can use to permanately upgrade yourself/allies.  A lot of people in the reviews said they just leave their game sitting there. All this does is allow you to collect gold. The bosses will be too tough to beat if you don't upgrade your characters. Leaving your game to farm gold does help, but it's a slow process unless you have done a lot of upgrading.  About the nude mod: it sucks. Don't play this game just to install it. I actually preffered the girls with their clothes on.  I absolutely recommend this game. I thought I would hate it but am now pretty addicted to it.",

This is a hentai game in about the same way that the moon is made of cheese. From a distance, someone uneducated could percieve it to be true, but it's just not. At most it's Ecchi, but the scantily clad anime women don't actually undress, pose in any manner that is remotely provocative, or try to make romantic advances on the player.   The moaning and whining sounds risque at best, but you'd have to be severely innocent to be able to get an honest fap out of this game. Yes, the game does move at a slow crawl, but it's an idle game. It plays it's damn self when you close it, and then you come back to it. And you do other things. Nothing terribly new here. Some folks complain about a lack of monster variety, but I'm guessing they only played a few minutes, and never got to higher levels where things like dragon girls, harpies, and bunny girls start to show up.   Perhaps the pacing for revealing new monster types is too slow for folks? It's meant to be slow. Found it fun to play while doing a lot of other things, which I am pretty sure is the intent. The different moans, while amusing, do run a bit old after a while.   Thankfully there are options to silence everything if you want to. There are in game purchases, but they don't in any way affect the gameplay, which actually strikes me as a very honest free to play model. Buying outfits is not to enhance the gameplay: it's strictly there to support the developer, and you don't have to do it to enjoy pretty much everything the game really offers you.  I'll probably unlock everything on this game over a period of a month or two, like with Clicker hero, before I get bored of it.  The game may also have interesting updates in the future. We'll see.  Also, by all accounts, better than Gone Home.",

Another thing I really liked about this game was the character customization. While I couldn't figure out how to change my gender, I was greeted with plenty of other customization options such as changing my outfit, hair style, hair color, and even my face. The graphics seemed to be very simple at first, but as I played the game I understood the deeper meaning as to why the enemies looked like what they did. Although there was no tutorial, the controls were very easy to learn and master. The sounds in this game were definitely very pleasing to listen to. The DLC in this game is an amazing addition to the quality of this masterpiece. The developers of this game are true geniuses for making this beautiful work of art. The only thing that could make this game better is online multiplayer, which I'm absolutely sure many people would enjoy. Although I might consider this a revolutionary free to play game, the highest i can give it is 7.8/10 because it has too much water.",

You could see these features as the games way to pull you in, just like a good opening paragraph.   This game is practically endless, but can have a completionist end. To 'complete' Sakura Clicker, you have to basically get every possible spirit upgrade. Spirit upgrades are basically this games way of making you want to play it more. You get spirits by restarting the game. You can only restart after getting a certain way into the game, which is usually inbetween Zone 13 to 20, with 20 being basically the have to restart point early on in the game, because of how long it takes to kill anything. These spirits allow you to buy upgrades (which I am hoping will have a definite end, if not, I will be spending way longer than anticipated playing this time waster of a game), which give you buffs for when you start over, to make you feel overpowered, and progress through the game faster, slowly reaching to the point where you quit last time, and hopefully passing that point.   Now do I like this game? Well yeah, and it's not for any idiotic reason, like enjoying the moaning sounds (I have had the game muted most of the time, so that I can do other stuff while it is left in the background), but it is generally because it is a good time waster. If you see this game as anything but a time waster, then you have generally suprised me.  If I would have to critique the game, I would say that it had a hard time running it along side normal internet activities, without giving my computer lag issues. This isn't necessarily a problem, because I can close the game, and just check on it within however long I chose to leave it dorment in my Steam library. But despite this not really being a problem, I would love an option to get rid of these laggy features (I am guessing the money flying all over the place is the main culprit for lag).  I will recommend this game, because it will continue to fill in the gaps of my bored, shut in life. If you have nothing better to do, get Sakura Clicker, it's not like scrolling down your Facebook newsfeed, or watching dumb Youtube videos, are in anyway better than clicking on big breasted Anime girls.",

If the initial game wasn't free-to-play, I would have felt cheated. And I am rather glad that what actual purchases you can make appear to be cosmetic and not some pay-to-win scheme. Still, there doesn't seem to be any endgame to strive for.

(ex: '1.)' )  Im just saying if you enjoy any hentai games this is exactly!... not what you are looking for. This game is basically a cookie clicker thats not on a web browser(so a download and application mostly like everything else on steam, i hope o-o), But! i would recommend it! (not for kids obvisouly) if you enjoy, or have a moan fetish or something jk lol, clicker based games that you basically 'click to win' say per say. I do at the time of this review have about 10-11 Hours in the game so im kind of addicted at the moment but it did just release as well a few days ago as per this review (7/30/15). So basically at the end of the day the only thing that sells in this game is its probably more for men (not leaving out some/alot of gay people such should i say as women actually (well im digging my grave i know XD sorry.. but i meant for this game. if and so, plus or minus) since there is only women/female enemies/bosses not forgeting you play as a female as well, as the apparent eye of the beholder of the sexiness and beauty (as per the world and or also anime) this game is directed for the male audience more than the female audience.(majority of it is sexual themes QUITE LITERALLY.)  1.) I recommend this game for people who just damn well love breaking their mouses on clicking as fast as they can (me) on the objects of sorts (cookie, guns, mine and, hot babe here and there until they yep thats normal :D ,etc. ) so basically i recommend predominantly horny male cookie clicker fans this game or just an anime nerd for some reason or wait THE ART WHICH IS CLEARLY IN THE SCREENSHOTS.(also im an anime like nerd of some stupid sort so yeah(an otaku? idk lol)) but still i like the game and all so have fun you probably horny 12 year olds jk i actually did have fun playing with my girlfriend on this game so lol. (and btw if you dont have headphones turn off the sounds unless you want your parents or neighbors thinking your watching porn/hentai or somehow making it o-o (auto-click) just good luck its fun.)    (basically, basically, basically, basically....... thats how many i used here thats a count of 4 so im gonna start putting counters in my reviews for 'basicallys' now XD lol btw this is the part where you leave and i also leave good day lol)",

You basically just click the girls to damage and defeat them and move on to the next area. You earn gold from defeating them which you use to upgrade your MC [aka the clicker] as well as buy upgrades and party members [which act like Grandma, Cookie Farm, stuff like that] Just like in Cookie Clicker, you'll get to the point where you don't really need to click as much anymore, though you'll still probably need to to complete the boss fights because those are timed. The girls also moan a lot when you hit them, so be wary of your sound volume lol  As for the DLC, it's purely cosmetic. Buy it if you feel like supporting the devs and changing up the look of your MC.  In conclusion, this is a free to play game. So just go and try it. You won't be disappointed, unless you're expecting more than just Cookie Clicker Anime Style.",

It's a clicker game, and for that, it's a very good one.  Pros: Great music and soundtrack! Good job! Also good voice acting for the moans, but I keep that off because it's too distracting, but that's just me. Anime girls that are mostly naked. Whats not to like? Lots of unlockable upgrades and characters! You will still always have something to upgrade, a new hero to unlock so they can help your character deal more damage. It collects look even if the game isnt running. I know this is standard of most clicker games but after seeing a few that dont, I decided to point it out. The bosses are very hard! Jitterclicking is a must. Did I mention how great the music is? I have found this game not to lag me at all, even with 2 other clicker games open, and skype, google chrome, and minecraft open as well! Cool! Lots of achievments! Cons: DLC is all pointless, but really I want to see the main character in a bikini so bad…. I may need to buy that dlc….. The nudity warning is really unjustified, and so is the age limit, as far as I can tell there is no full nudity (yet). Though it does come close on some characters, no full nudity. Dont really know what the age limit is for.  Verdict: 9.5/10 would download again. Is free and looks amazing, with no DLC that is forced upon you. Have fun wasting your life!",

            "review_text": "There isn't much to say about this game besides the obvious, so heres a copy pasta   n what way is white knight a dumb insult? What exactly do you mean? It's a term that subverts one of the most prevalent literary themes in the adventure stories and fantasies of our childhood. Was there ever a child who didn't pick up a toy sword and imagine themselves to be the civilized hero protecting the weak from from the forces of evil? This trope is relevant to all of us. These stories made enacting justice an absolute virtue and we grew up imagining ourselves as 'white knights' saving the weak from the uncivil. We lived out these fantasies in our imagination and learned that it felt pleasant to be a purveyor of justice, and some of us started to desire that pleasure too much.  That's a problem because the adult world is too complex for that trope to play out as cleanly as it does in stories. An author gets to tell you who is good, who is oppressed, and who is evil -- and this makes the justice of the hero's actions crystal clear. The author's white knight can commit to their campaign with absolute zealotry and the reader is free to revel in pleasurable justice. However, in real life it is often impossible to say who is good, who is oppressed, and who is evil. This is where the problems begin. Lets say I hold a position that I know is virtuous, and I see someone being oppressed by a person who I know is evil. I step in, fully committed to my attack, because I know that it is appropriate to take pleasure in administrating this justice. But are my acts really justified? Is it right that I derive pleasure from them? The fact is I am only acting on my PERCEPTION of reality. Maybe my perception squares with reality, but maybe it doesn't. There is a huge problem with enacting justice when your view of the situation is distorted. This is the premise of one of the most influential novels of all time, The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha.  Its about an old Spanish man around the year 1600 who is obsessed with romantic novels about knights and chivalry. After much isolated reading he becomes manically deluded and starts to believe that he is a knight and that he must set out to revive chivalry, undo wrongs, and bring justice to the world. In a way, Don Quixote was the world's first otaku (a person obsessed with particular aspects of popular culture to the detriment of their social skills). The story plays him for the fool he is, and we laugh at his unwavering commitment to a deluded sense of justice. He even attempts to rescue maidens who are under no threat, in need of no rescue, and are utterly shocked that he believes he's acting on their behalf.  Don Quixote was a cutting satire of the trope of the romantic and chivalrous knight. The phrase 'white knight' now encapsulates everything Don Quixote had to say about the issue, and calling someone a white knight is the same as calling them a Don Quixote. It is a shorthand way of telling them that the real world is more complex than the delusional fantasy of justice they are committed to.  So 'white knight' is not a 'dumb' insult. It's an insult that draws power from a rich history of romance fantasy literature and one of the most significant satirical novels of all time.",

I am one who gets addicted to clicker games, but never has a clicker game ever made me want to strategize into beating a boss. Maybe it's the boobs, maybe it's the thighs, maybe it's the moans, maybe I just really want to hear them call me a pervert and ask for more still?  It's simple japanese in this game, so their words are obvious when they 'stop!' 'sorry!' 'pervert!' and of course, my favorite, 'more!'   Is that all you got? It's a simple clicker-game, where a pervert can be free and well, get the points they need by defeated all these beautiful girls and bosses. Sure, it gets repetitive, but the new harems that come in once in while is a nice treat that can make you go 'Oooh'.  Well, i'm very late to this party, but I wanted to write a review anyway!! I only spent 3 hours on it, but it was three hours straight that I ignored everyone, got called a pervert endless times by my parents, and 3 hours worth of feeling some kind of way over their moans for more...  Save yourself.   Dont play this.  But if you do, make Haru your priority, and the last one to hire, first one to upgrade.",

Until or unless the trading cards are relabeled correctly as 'collector items' specifically for this game, I can only come to the conclusion that Steamworks have been scammed into promoting this with certain features to get money for themselves and whomever they allowed booster ability.  Unless you're a fan of the artist or clicker hero type games, which you honestly could be going elsewhere for anyway, this is the absolute WORST form of begging I've seen.  Don't offer trading cards when you can't unlock booster. Stop advertising the feature, it's dishonest and scummy. If there hadn't been trading cards, I would have been happy to have bought and kept the DLC, but you lied, so no sale.  tl:dr DO NOT PUT ANY MONEY INTO THIS GAME AND JUST PLAY IT FOR FREE, FALSE ADVERTISING ON CARDS, SIDE STEPPING STEAM TAXES BY LINKING TO A PERSONAL ARTIST ACCOUNT PATREON SUBSCRIPTION  DO NOT BUY DLC FOR THIS GAME DO NOT BUY CARDS FOR THIS GAME UNTIL BOOSTERS ARE FREED FROM THIS HOSTAGE SITUATION  The Steam DLC doesn't count towards booster unlock.  In game only to unlock, no in game shop, only in game purchase option goes to a patreon and all discussions end with 'just buy off the market' or they'll even say, 'gems', but once again, this is ignoring the very glaring problem of not being able to get the booster unlock.  The discussion page even has a sticky post that says cards are coming...half a year ago with a n/t = no text. Clearly, people have booster capability and the developer is ignoring questions on how others may also obtain it.  Not being able to unlock booster while others obviously have seals the deal, I know a racket when I see one, but just when you thought broken and discontinued items on steam were bad enough, this is clearly misadvertised as having 'trading cards' when the low amount and high prices for the cards AND BOOSTERS clearly screams some of somebodies buddies were given the feature so they can sell the cards while others weren't. At a ransom price for cards in general. ...30 cents for one reg card.  Is this a f2p that I can spend 40 dollars with my steam wallet or a hostage situation?  I'm going to look around for someone to make this right, but for all intents and purposes, DO NOT BUY DLC IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO UNLOCK BOOSTER, SOMETHING IS TERRIBLY WRONG HERE AND IT STINKS.

Rumor has it that other places can satisfy that curiosity. While there are moans, they quickly become a nuisance and I muted all sound in the game after the first hour. After a few hours of play it becomes obvious that even playing the game is optional. For 9 hours or more I simply muted the game and had it run in the background. But it turns out that the best way to gain more gold is actually to turn the game off and come back in a few hours. Also, once you get an ally to auto attack, it becomes optional for you to play even when the game is open. So this is a clicker that you don't need to click after the first two minutes, and is more efficiently played by turning it off. Even at the price of free, this isn't worth it.",

You get a lot less money than most games as well.  Graphics are mediocre at best, and gets a bit boring because there is nothing going on little animations when the enemies get hit and when they are defeated. You can customize your own character but its quite limited without spending money on other customizers.

Now, keep in mind that I am never one to complain when sexy women are involved, quite frankly I quite enjoy it. I am not one of those people to go around whinging about women in video games being un-realistic and objectified.. However, there is a border in which certain things cross where it's no longer a game or something to be played to have fun with, but just to act as free or cheap fapping material.   Sakura Clicker, the latest entry to the Sakura series is disguised as an action packed, fast paced, exciting adventure, click to win game and it's nothing of the sort. You launch the game and it plonks you straight in-front of two beautiful anime girls, one is your character, the other your foe. Click away and of course, the moaning begins.  It saddens me that things like this come out disguised as games, why? Because it proves to everyone whom accuses games to objectify women, to in these cases be completely correct. Not only that, but they are designed to pull you in and keep you addicted.  Mind you, that's not even really my complaint behind it. The mechanic of clicking is not my argument of it not being a game either, I've been wrapped up in playing them many times before and the addictive facor always plays a part in keeping you clicking away. No.. My main points against this is that there is no premise in which this is set upon, there is no story, there is no advancement, you are just given 10 cute monster girls that increase in hit points as you go along and that is literally the entirety of this 'game'. There isn't even a level counter, which I honestly think would have added immensely to the game  All in all, I don't find it very tasteful, but on the premise of just being a clicker, it's as good as they get, especially with the bonus of DLC pretties. Want to have gift wrapping on your cute anime warrior? Go right ahead it's all there!  For the fact that there are so many fapping and one handed jokes, you can do better than this. Do me a favor, open your web browser, find yourself a good hentai website and wank that way. Least you don't have to click on the screen for moaning to be heard.",

If you're looking for an Idle / Clicker game, I would recommend something else if you're looking for just the gameplay and not the aesthetics. This game looks pretty, but it doesn't get very far with the gameplay at all, and it gets fairly repetitive and boring real fast, real quick.",

And sadly, I was dissapointed. This is much more basic to Clicker Games and does nothing new; and when I mean nothing I mean the exact same things as other clicker games, except with anime chicks dressed up as animals wearing too little clothes. All you do in this game is click and upgrade to get better. The waves are endless and sadly, I felt there was just nothing to keep me going. All the enemies are the exact same, the moans soon just get repetitive and the soundtrack isn't that good. So unfortuantely, I can't give this game a positive; even for the people playing just for a wank. Search it up ONLINE. Trust me: much better.",

Since the game is free, there is no harm in just downloading it and giving it a try yourself...unless you will feel awkward having your Steam friends notice that you've played it. If that's the case, please read on.  The game consists of clicking over and over again on enemies to defeat them. Defeated enemies drop gold which can be used to power up your character or hire assistants (who don't appear on screen) that will damage enemies continuously. You can purchase special moves, and there are various rewards (like a permanent increase in all damage dealt) for reaching certain level milestones for your helpers.  Like most Sakura games, the graphics are gorgeous--though you'll have to forgive the developer for reusing enemy sprites. All of the monsters are actually scantily clad women who moan as you fight them (you can turn the moaning off if you find it embarrassing or distracting). You can change the look of your character, and a variety of DLC packs are available for greater customization.  The reason I don't recommend this game is because it only seems to be fun for the first hour or so. After that the difficulty starts ramping up much faster than the level of your character or helpers leading to grinding and frustration. I would prefer a smoother experience. For me, games like this are only addictive if you can continue to feel a real sense of progression. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you, I'd actually be willing to recommend it.

Overall,  • Really repetitive gameplay, even for a clicker game.  • One song for the entire game, it doesn't even change for each themed Zone. Lazy.  • Not enough hair colors and eye colors for your custom girl.  • The DLC is, as others have mention, is nothing more than putting clothes on a dollmaker. Not worth $0.99 per article.  • It would be more fun to have clothes that cost in-game currency than actual currency.  • Once you hit the 100aa's the game will start to lose its charm entirely and just turns into a grind or a waiting game.  Maybe someday Sakura Dollmaker could be a thing, but knowing Winged Cloud all they ever want to make is ecchi games that take themselves too seriously. To the point of being cringeworthy.  Also why are there shirts?? Why would you want a shirt of this game? Why does a shirt with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anime girls come in female sizes?
