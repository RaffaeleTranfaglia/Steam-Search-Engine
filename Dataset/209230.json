No wonder they have an achievement just to watch the whole thing without skipping. No one would watch them otherwise...  Nice game to get 100% achievements on and not too much work getting either.",

            "review_text": "Short HOG (it took me about two hours) with a few cool ideas. You get a medallion early on in the game, which gives you different powers to use as you progress (eg strength to break things to find more objects). The VOs for Holmes and Watson are good, but unfortunately Henry isn't the best. The ending is rather abrupt, but the last cutscene is really cute. I reccommend this for a sale because of the length (although I did skip some puzzles).",

            "review_text": "Normally I am not much into hidden object games. More an Adventure/RPG type of gamer. But this game is done very well. It is very loosely based on 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' (actually so loosely that it has little to do with it ), however the creators just made a game that is fun to play and that is more important than trying to make a game realistic or following some story.   Contrary to most adventure/casual games this has quite a lot of different kind of puzzles. For instance, one based on planar graphs, a puzzle based on rotating groups of tiles (which I found the most difficult yet solvable after a little thought), a few about identifying objects in a scene etc. It is nice to see a game with such a variety. The renderings are awesome. Don't expect much animation though the game is mainly still pictures with some animation happening when you solve a puzzle but the game still looks gorgeous.  Another thing is that the game isn't too easy yet can be solved without a walkthrough. There are also buttons that let you skip a puzzle when you are stuck or ask for help. I skipped one puzzle ( the one where you have to compare, the painting of a vase, to the 'real thing' and find the differences) because I needed to quit).  I clocked in about 16 hours.",

            "review_text": "Let's be honest, it's a Hidden Object game. It succeeds very well in being a Hidden Object game. Most of the puzzles can be solved with a bit of logic, but if you've played some of the puzzle games like Professor Layton or Puzzle Agent, you'll be able to solve many by memory, rather than logic. Most of the hidden object areas aren't the hardest and there's a good hint system to help you out. Voice acting seems to be by the same guys who do Watson and Holmes in the other Frogwares games, if you're particularly attached to them. If you like Hidden Object games, this is probably a game that you will enjoy for a few horus. (PS... This isn't exactly how the real story goes... This is more... Sherlock Holmes with superpowers and time travel... But hey, Sherlock Holmes with superpowers and time travel, right!?)",

            "review_text": "I would only recommend this game for two reasons: Achievements, and its novelty. Other than that, I dunno why you'd even want to buy this game.  If you want a good Holmes game, go play games like 'Holmes vs. Ripper', 'Holmes: Awakened' or 'Holmes: Nemesis'  (Note that these are truncated names I tend to use).  Achievements aren't too difficult to get, as they usually involve solving puzzles in X amount of time, solving X puzzles in X time, and things like that. But the game  needs  to be played through twice to get everything, which is a pain, especially when you hit the Charles door puzzle. Augh. But once you've got the 'Golden Hound' achievement, you get another perfect game added to your profile. Yay.  Speaking of puzzles, most of them involve finding stuff in a screen of messiness, which can be painful because you think you find everything, and then you realise the object is placed in the stupidest place (Apparently, a crude drawing of a candle on the side of a door  actually  classifies as a candle object). Besides that, you have generic puzzles and all with varying difficulty, some better than others.  As I mentioned before, the game has its novelties. How so?  For starters, you get  superpowers . Like, time-travel (selective moments only), super strength, telekinesis and some other 'totally logical' abilities to help you solve the case. I gotta say, out of the entire Sherlock Holmes Humble Bundle,  no other Holmes game has this feature . Probably because it makes less sense of the game with its very existence. But still novel.   And the Hound of Baskerville? I didn't think they'd take it seriously as an actual Hell Hound, and defeating it requires a mystic ritual involving odd runed stones.    What about other aspects?  Character development ? Pathetic, and didn't really help the story at all. Amusing, if anything?  Interface ? I don't recall much about it, but it was  okay .  Story ? It made less and less logical sense the more I played it. Especially at the end   with the puppy what's-his-face gifts to Holmes  .  Overall, I guess the best rating I'd give this is a measly 6/10.  At least it's better than 'Holmes &amp; the Mystery of the Mummy'.",

The worst part about this is that there is no save game feature and thus when the program crashes one has to start a chapter all over again. Replay a few chapters more than once and watch one's frustrations rise. STRONGLY AVOID.",

The supernatural story is an affront to Holmesian reason, the voice actors are poorly cast, and the visuals are often of poor quality. Moreover, the hidden object scenes are roughshod and the puzzles range from dirt simple to frustratingly unintuitive. There are certainly some redeeming qualities here and there - an excellent map, for example - but the overall experience is just a little sub-par.",
