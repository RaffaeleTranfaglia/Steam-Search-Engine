Upsetting, people put EFFORT into this. Not the youtubers though, a lot of them sound like they phoned this in.",

            "review_text": "Surprisingly, this was a great play ( well still is). I have completed the game twice, on easy and medium. Each difficulty makes the game more challenging (to no-one's surprise) and with each level of difficulty, makes the game more fun. Maybe you want a relaxing 2D platformer with the easy difficulty or whether you want to play the Dark Souls of 2D platformers with 1 life pug mode.  This games story is ok. It is nice to see the well known Youtubers all come together in one game and fight along-side each other. The references are fun. However, it suffers from something that I call 'Mario Story Disease'. Main Villian steals something, Main character goes to get it back, goes through endless hords of enemies by jumping on them or killing them in any way, fights a variety of mini-bosses to get to main one, kills main boss, the end. That sums up the story. Its witty, but lacks a unique factor other that 'duuh, my fav utober is there, duuh'. That isn't unique Conclusion I would give this a game a: 8.5 / 10 - It is really fun - Controlls well - Got lots of recognisable faces - Likeable characters and lots of development - With some really good character development. However: - The story is predictable - Lacks the character development which I was expecting - Co-op is local ( I think) - Repetative after a while.  I have been BabyFace, and that is what I thought of Pewdiepie: Legend of the Brofist.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game because I'm a big fan of PewDiePie, but... The gameplay is weird, especially jumping mechanics. There are times when you jump around enemy like crazy, and can't hit them. Characters tend to slide off platforms, they might also jump and reach the platform, but somehow not land on it (and fall to their death in most cases). This happened especially on holiday maps (Halloween, Valentine's Day and so on) Also, the gameplay is repetitive, you go from place to place, kill the boss after few arenas, and so on. Level designs are ok, but could be better. Artstyle and music are really nice. Voice acting is decent, I believe Markiplier did the best job. Extra note: I didn't play in Polish (I switched to English) but I can see why people are complaining about translation, looking only at achievements section. It's both bad and cringy. In the end, I give this game solid 4/10. It's not the worst, but could be (and should be) a lot better.",

The art style and frame rate are great.80% of the acheivments took me 8 hours to get. THERES SO MUCH POST GAME CONTENT! All the levels are designed well... kind of. 4 levels were so long they were grueling. The halloween, christmas, and valentines day levels. The halloween is meh, christmas ones look innovative but are full of gimmicks...but the 'Love is in the Air' level is so grueling. I actually wNted to get over with it. This game ran at 1600x1200 60fps with only steam in the backround, and ran at 25 FPS while OBS recording at 60 fps. To give you an idea. While this game is short the replay value makes up for it in every way. One small problem is the dialogue. The writing is funny and nice, but the voice acting (CinnamonToastKen and Jacksepticeye specificly) sounds slightly rushed. The voice levels are all slightly different. Some voices are echoed and fast when they dont need to be. PROS MEH CONS Replay Value There is and adult joke with pewds and cry, Rushed voice acting Level Design Because im christian i didn't like it, but it Holiday levels characters didn't get offended. I just shut off my monitor General ------ fight on hard+ is  'I axept da kontrakt' for 30 seconds. honestly unfair frames  art style I'm not a pewdiepie fan and dont watch mature characters youtubers, so i didn't get all the refrences. short yet structered story humorous script 9/10 would buy, dont even wait for a sale, gte it now!",

Obviously the voice acting isn't going to be the best in the world. They are commentators, not actors.  Would I recommend this game? Yes. It's great fun and a great little time killer.  Pros: -Challenging -Funny -You can play as different characters -The music is awesome!  Cons: -Sometimes the character you are playing as does not respond when you move it (this is on keyboard, not sure about controller)",
