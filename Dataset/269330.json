            "review_text": "Chronology is a fairly short but fairly fun puzzle platformer that will has a delightful story and uses gameplay mechanics similar to Giana Sisters without the brutal difficulty. The story is about an old scientist who wakes up in a devastated post apocalyptic world and finds an item he can use to go back to the past. He uses this power to go back and confront his mentor who is the cause for destroying the future. Along the way he meets a genetically engineered snail with the power to freeze time.   I found the characters heartwarming especially the snail. The old man had a bit of a crotchety disposition but it's understandable if your mentor plotted behind your back and used your research to destroy the world. Who wouldn't be a bit crotchety about that? Overall I found the story fun, the puzzles were well done and I only looked to a guide to figure out one of them. So to sum it up, this is a nice little family friendly game. Featuring solid controls and puzzle mechanics.",

Meh, he's a minor character anyway and sacrifice was needed in order to save the world. I can't help but compare Chronology to The Silent Age (another timey wimey game), and in my mind a game like that shouldn't be too easy like The Silent Age. Chronology has everything: good puzzles, rememberable characters, sacrfices, anti-hero and a deadbeat villain.",

I didn't like that I finished the game too quickly, because I found it a bit too easy. Bago games mentioned that this was a mix between LIMBO and Braid, however those games provided me with a more interesting and longer gameplay.",

It's a simple platform game but the puzzles involved make very challenging at times. I have to say what I loved the most about this game was the art. I found it beautiful and I loved how detailed everything is for a 2d game. The soundtrack was a nice background to the whole game. I really liked the song they used during the credits. I think the only downside to this game is how short it is. I would have loved to continue playing, I had a lot of fun and there were quite a few chuckles to be had over the commentary between the two characters.  All in all it's a decent price but if you can get it on sale like I did, then it is a game I highly recommend you pick up.",
