Even when running on the minimal graphics settings on a strong, capable computer, the highest FPS achieved is around 15-16FPS, rendering the game utterly unenjoyable and unplayable. I rather spend $5 on an overpriced piece of used tissue. Please don't even consider pulling out your wallet for this title.",

            "review_text": "Pretty with soothing music, and that's about all the praise I can give it. The physics is pointlessly frustrating. Your ball has a ridiculous amount of inertia, meaning that most of your time is spent hitting obstacles and standing still -- even worse if you're trying to proceed upslope. It gives you just enough side-to-side pseudo-3D 'freedom' to screw you up by running you into ground roughness that throws you off your path and sends you into pits, and if you try to take advantage of that to find better routes, you run into invisible walls. I am not an unskilled gamer (I've made it through most of I Wanna Be The Guy) and I still found myself stuck for upwards of three minutes after falling into the first pit in the first level. The provided step isn't high enough for your jump to get you out, and trying to build momentum by running in circles in the pit slams you either into invisible walls or the step, both of which stop you dead, so you have to basically wade around in molasses until you manage to bounce off the step at just the right angle to hop back into play.   That, and fighting with the game to gett its screen resolution right on my dual-monitor setup, was my entire 15-minute play experience. Game deleted with prejudice.",

Also, starting menu is bugged, and you can select any level even if buttons are not lit up.  I can only recomend it on a VERY deep sale in a bundle, since it is mostly just a showcase of Cry Engine.",

I played 1 hour and these are my opinions:  Pro: + Beautiful graphic. + Almost Free Done  Let's see the Cons: - After 5 mins the music is a little bit annoying. (Especially when you fall down from a bridge at 20th times.) - Camera is shaking when you try to jump over the bridges. And, you are falling down... - Position of the camera change it's angle sometimes and these changes are enough to roll down from the middle of the plank. Thanks. - The Ball is heavy but even a smallest stone can drop it away a little bit to change it's direction. Not good when you try gain speed to roll up on a plank to the higher platform.  If these problems don't annoy you, you will get a good challenge.",

I later on managed to launch 'Level 1' movement works, but feels a bit sloppy. Couple times after jumping I lost all my speed and jumped backwards.  At least the game looks nice.

You should pick up shiny orbs as you progress. Why? ♥♥♥♥ if I know.  This game is a whole lotta nothing. It's pretty and it has physics, and that's about it.   Level design is atrocious. It's 3D but would've been better in 2D. There's platform physics, but sometimes that means jumping on platforms floating in water. If the platform dips a little because you didn't land perfectly in the middle, guess what? Lakitu decides you fell in anyway and takes you back to a checkpoint.  Whoa what a surprising twist! I thought I was gonna cross over that bridge but that Lakitu guy cut it and I fell into the water below! Then he fished me out! Why? ♥♥♥♥ if I know.  You know what's a great idea?  Make some levels with the progression towards the camera so you can't see where you're going! Make a double jump ability that kills all x-axis momentum! Make the game use 100% cpu power to get 40 fps! Who uses GPUs anyway. Make sure some inputs stay locked in so you can't control your speed sometimes! Make sure you reuse entire level sections, but at night time so they can't tell!  Every loading screen and pause menu has the Cryengine splash on it. Sometimes you run into walls that have red blocks saying 'REPLACE ME.' This is a glorified tech demo that someone wanted to make a quick buck off of. My friend bought this for me for 50 cents to make me squirm.  He succeeded.",

First things first: I love the graphics and the ambiente of this little Plattformer, and thats also why i would recommend this. The Gameplay and the levels are somehow repeditive and not really challenging and also pretty short (I played through all the levels in about an hour or so).  So IF you -like me- play games just for theyre stunning graphics and IF you have a good discount on this one (full price is to high in my opinion) ---&gt; buy it :D",
