            "review_text": "I dig this game. You level a human, elf or dwarf by entering dungeons with randomly generated encounters. Leaving a dungeon without dying means you get to keep the loot you earned, so fleeing to fight another day is a good idea. The goal is to complete all dungeons and rescue the local baron's daughter from the villain. Kind of a classic theme and gives you something to work towards aside from filling up your skillset and upgrading your gear. Gear seems to be also randomly generated, so you get different combinations like elven sword of the bear or leather cap of the owl, depending on makeup and enchantment.  You definitely feel the progression, even if you have to go into a dungeon multiple times to kind of grind levels, because everytime you enter a dungeon it gets a little easier, and you get a little farther. I'm just about to take down the spider boss of the forest dungeon after it handed me my butt last time. For a simplistic dungeon crawler there is a lot of rich dialog and story atmosphere. Definitely addictive. You want to keep getting strong and getting farther, and it doesn't suck away a lot of your time so you can power through or play it in short sessions casually.",

I found that i just ended up using blitz skill first to one shot every enemy with no semblance of strategy. If you cant beat an enemy then just go back to town and start over, one shotting enemies until you get bored. I made it to level 20 before i gave up.",

            "review_text": " Skilltree Saga  is a bad concept well executed. Some game designer evidently concluded that gamers love managing their equipment and progressing up a skill tree  so much  that the sensible thing to do would be to offer a game that strips away all the other elements of an RPG, and makes the player responsible for inventory and skill-progression management of a character who is otherwise a complete automaton, progressing from one randomly selected monster to the next, and battling them entirely without your input. It's boring and tedious.  On the plus side, the graphics are pretty and the background music is pleasant, although the sound of 'your' character and the monsters he fights endlessly making the same repetitive grunts at each other gets aggravating quickly. The English translation is rather weak, too.  Bottom line,  Skilltree Saga  removes too much autonomy from the player, resulting in a pseudo-RPG that's a very small step removed from being a clicker game. If that's the experience you're seeking, you're probably better off just playing a clicker in the first place.",
