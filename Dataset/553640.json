As you follow the narrator's omnipresent voice, you will see through ICEY's eyes and learn the truth about her world. The narrator will constantly urge you in one direction, but you must ask, &quot;Why? Why am I following his directions?“ Obey? Rebel?",

            "review_text": "Time Played at review's writing: ~2 hours  Jeez, this game...  Okay, so, it's a Meta-Narrative 2D Action Platformer. You start the game and think to yourself, 'Okay, a lot of this narrative is gonna be told old-school, through the on-screen actions of the performers, cool.' Then you beat the first boss, and everything gets turned on its ear. Suddenly, you're kicked back out to the title screen after seeing faux error messages and a 'system reboot.' That's where the real game, and the real narrative, begins.  Now, clearly, I have not discovered a lot of what this game has to offer just yet. But I'm already rockin' close to half the achievements, so it's probably a fairly short game. That definitely works against it, but, and this is a big but, it's a compelling game.  There's not much else I can say that isn't spoiler-y, unfortunately, but I'll say stuff anyway, so if you don't want spoilers, from this point on, you've been warned.  The Meta nature of this game is very interesting. No, ICEY isn't the first game to have done a meta-narrative like this. It definitely takes some inspiration from The Stanley Parable, in that the game reverse-psychology-encourages you to explore by doing literally the exact opposite of what the narrator tells you. The narration is in some dialect of Chinese. I don't know enough to tell you if it's Mandarin or Cantonese, or some other dialect, but I will say, as an English speaker, it's not off-putting. The subtitles are mostly short and succint, not really detracting from what's on screen, and the bits where the narrator is chiming in because you're not following his instructions are still delivered in such a way that the emotions in the dialogue come across, language-barrier or no.  The Action itself is fairly simple, and follows a lot of tried-and-true methods of other spectacle fighter's, like Devil May Cry or God of War. Major difference here is, there only seems to be a single weapon, unlike the other titles I've mentioned, but the combo's are very satisfying, and once you've learned a few of them, the rest become very intuitive. For first-time Spectactle Fighter's, this is a great learning point, allowing you to build the skills necessary to get those Triple S combo's in Devil May Cry.  The 'Platforming' in this game, I'll argue, is non-existant. It's a platformer in the most basic sense, where there is stuff to get to, and you have to find a way to get to it... But it's super easy, since you can dash, along the ground or through the air, indefinitely. And you know what? I don't feel like this takes away from the experience at all. In fact, it's a really important mechanic for finding the secret rooms that this game is just absolutely flush with. Dashing into the sky to make sure there's an actual ceiling and nothing above you is really important for finding some of the secret areas, many of which I've already found, and many more I'm bound to find, I'm sure. The infinite dash seems like it could break combat, but it doesn't at all, since most of the enemies move around quite a lot, making dashing good for closing distance, but that's about it. Though, spamming it around to get the dodge attack could be a little cheesy, but I haven't been able to get that tactic to work reliably.  Speaking of the combat again, the animations are lovely. Most of the enemy stuff is pretty well telegraphed, so getting the Dash-Riposte is generally more about skill than luck, but some of it is still twitch-reflexes, with some enemy attack animations being decidedly shorter than others. Again, as a learning point for Spectacle Fighters, this game is a great starting point because of that, since -most- of the enemy attacks are fairly well telegraphed, but all but the most basic enemies tend to have at least one attack that's nearly insta-fire and requires that internalization of the animation and the twitch-reflexes to reliably counter. The character animations are great too, and ICEY herself looks fantastic, almost like something out of Shadowrunner, a sci-fi samurai.  The music isn't top-tier, but it's certainly not bad. While a bit repetitive, it's not invasive, so once you get to that point where you've heard the same track 25 times, you tune it out instead of hating it and wishing it would die.  I kind of love everything about the art-style. It's sort of new-agey, almost in the vein of anime, but distinctly different and unique. On top of some of the weirder elements of the art-style, like the very clearly 3D rendered computer monitor that makes up part of the meta-narrative, to the flashing images of real eyes in the monitor room, to the reptilian eye that covers your screen in the Monitor Room when meeting the Yellow King, this game takes several strange, disparate elements, and somehow makes them all feel like they belong.  And getting back to the narrative, at least to where I'm at, the game doesn't try to blow your mind too hard. I think this is a good thing. I'm not saying it won't blow your mind, (or mine, when I get there,) but I am saying that it's content to let it build, let you see some weirdness and go, 'Okay, what,' then sweep that under the rug for a while and let you get back into the rhythm of the action, waiting for the right moment to blow you away. It's not crazy and it doesn't throw shock-factor into the mix, like some games in this vein do or could. Instead, it actually is building an interesting, compelling narrative that compels you to try and figure out just what the hell is going on. And it does it subtly, with every little thing appearing to be a hint or a clue, but certainly, some if it is bound to be red herrings. And on that point, the writing is just superb, leading you by the nose just enough to keep you curious, but not so much as to make you feel like the action is a slog to find the good part of the game.  All said and done, I really can't recommend this game enough. As a huge Spectacle Fighter fan, I worried that the combat might be too shallow for me, but it's incredibly satisfying, and the strange narrative makes every encounter and every challenge feel like just that, a challenge worth overcoming in order to discover what weirdness lies around the next corner. Or, you know, on the next screen. Add in the keen sense of humor that'll absolutely hit home for any hardcore gamer, and you've got yourself a real diamond in the rough.  I bought ICEY on sale for 10$. Even with a lot of good games, it's not often that I say this, but I actually wish I'd bought it at full price... Which I think would've only been like 11$, but still, I absolutely think the Developer deserves every penny of that. More even. Knowing what I know now, I'd honestly pay 20$ for this game without reservation or regret. If you're a fan of 2D brawlers, spectacle fighters, meta-narrative games, or cool art styles, buy ICEY.",

            "review_text": "Not as good as people say (minor spoilers ahead).  ICEY is a 2D brawler littered with repetitive meta humor. Every joke follows the same formula: You don't do as you're told and the narrator gets mad at you. Then some random 'funny' element is added to the mix and you get a tiny piece of cryptic (but boring) background info.  I'll be brutally honest: If you've played The Stanley Parable, this game will probably bore you to death. The combat is great fun, until it gets old an hour or two later (enemy variety is very low, though some of the bosses are nice). But the meta elements just don't work. Why? Because this game has actual GAMEPLAY.  Meta games tend to have barely any gameplay, to the point where people argue they aren't games anymore. As a result, the meta/humor/narrative takes the spotlight. You simply don't have all that much to do in those games, so you might as well hunt down those narrative parts. They're the driving force behind those games.  In ICEY though, you have a solid, enjoyable combat system, as well as an upgrade system. Those clash heavily with the meta elements, because they stop you dead in your tracks - in an action game. The action pumps you up (especially on hard mode), but then the game forces you to listen to some lame joke for several minutes, killing all your momentum with trivial rants. And yes, it always goes like 'Why aren't you listening? Are you stupid? Why won't you do as you're told? I worked so hard on this!' Sound familiar? That's because it is - and it repeats over and over again. ICEY is the 'funny guy' who keeps telling the same joke all night long. It gets old quick.  Speaking of lame jokes: I am sure the humor works well in Chinese, but without an English voice actor to sell those lines, you might as well not bother at all. Not a single moment worked for me. None. Instead of being entertained, I was wondering how much fun Chinese people must be having with the game. I am also very versed when it comes to meta-level content in videogames (Stanley, Talos, Pony Island, the list goes on), meaning the novelty had worn off for me before I even started playing the game.  Sadly, ICEY adds nothing new to the mix. It doesn't take any risks and it doesn't try anything interesting. It doesn't iterate, it copies. All it does is take some of those old jokes and recycle them over and over again. There is a moment when the narrator's phone rings, and it is used TWICE, in two rooms next to each other, and both times for two different jokes. Haha, his phone is ringing. So funny when it happens for the second time about two minutes later. Yes, both jokes take vastly different turns, but it still feels cheap and unimaginative - in a freaking game about meta humor, where creativity MUST be king at all cost. The only time I nearly, barely chuckled, was when someone got shot (I am not even joking).  Another issue I'm having is the way sound is handled. The soundtrack is pretty badass if you're into electronic music. But for some reason, the devs failed to make the tracks loop properly. I am not sure if it's my PC or just how the game works. But if you can't even loop your music properly, don't even think about receiving a thumbs up. This is as basic as it gets.  'Luckily', I've had far bigger issues with the game's design. So thumbs down for it regardless. It's a real shame. Because after all those raving reviews and impressions by people I actually like and respect, ICEY turned out to be a decent (but way too small and short) action game that uses old and outdated meta humor as a crutch. Both, the narrative and the gameplay, are severely lacking in depth and variety. I wish the devs had settled on one of the two, rather than both. Because this is neither solid, nor liquid. It's average at best. But I am not that forgiving.  I had high hopes for this game, but ended up terribly underwhelmed and disappointed. Yeah, you can buy it if you want. It's not that much of a waste. Just be aware that people with more experience are unlikely to find anything of interest in ICEY. If you haven't played Stanley, chances are you're going to have a good time. Mine was very mixed though. The only thing I enjoyed was the gameplay, but there simply wasn't enough of it.",

Lovecraft references, so this didn't have to go to far past that to impress me, but it did.   ICEY is a refreshing meta game pushing the boundaries of expectation within games, yet in a way in which is still has beautiful graphics and fast-paced gameplay, and is riddled with humor.  There are multiple references to external media, philosophical questions, and rapid action gameplay. The game references H.P. Lovecraft, Silent Hill, The Yellow King, 1984, and more that I'm finding the deeper I go.   This game surprised me a lot for the price. There are still some glitches I encountered, but the experience of the game as a whole has been enjoyable enough that I can look past them. The easter eggs are very interesting, and fun to discover. Reminds me of The Stanley Parable, The Talos Principle, and of course metroidvania style games.",

I'm sure some of you will enjoy it, but personally I didn't. The controls are strange, which is fine, but the tutorial is very lack luster, and I was left confused for my play through wondering how dodges worked. I discovered combos were a thing right at the end of my playthrough. Combos didn't seem necessary when I could just as easily button mash and still kill the enemy just fine with no damage taken. The upgrades are also a little bit underwhelming. I would love to see the upgrades add more variation beyond pressing J and I repeatedly. OST is alright from what I heard, and the art is nice to look at.   My main problem, is the narration feels very forced at times. I understand where the inspiration for this game comes from, but it feels like the game was created purposely to try and push players not to listen to the narrator and to go out and find stuff, rather than surprising the player with the ability to ignore the narrator. I wish ignoring the narrator was just more subtle. Other than that, the fourth wall breaking is a nice touch, but it feels, again, very forced, as if the game 'breaking' or 'getting to an unfinished level' was so forced that the narrator, or game creator, tried so hard to force the player to experience that moment. I didn't feel like I was discovering things I wasnt supposed to, just because it was so easy to leave. Good moments involved the game going into some sort of console and toying with its own playability. I would've loved to see that expanded upon, as it instantly reminded me of games like Pony Island and SuperHot.  Aside from that, I'm sure some of you will enjoy the game. Give it a try if you've enjoyed The Stanley Parable and games of the like. Just for me personally, it wasnt a game I enjoyed.",

Controls are pretty tight, visuals are flashy and gameplay is equal parts power trip and tough scrap. You'll know when you're doing well, and when your flashy combo ends in you getting faceplanted into the ground it'll snap you back into difficult positioning challenges. Encourages exploration, both with risks and rewards, and the reaction based combat options know whether or not you actually reacted or are mashing with tears in your eyes.  Overall highly recommended - and you can't just say no to a game that pairs a straightforward game with meta concepts, and still makes time to add in a little humor here and there.  Definitely worth it on sale, and would say it's well worth $11 - God knows anyone reading this has probably shelled out more for less.",

Reading the subtitles is necessary if you don't understand mandarin but the dialogue is translated well. Combat is fun and flashy. Of course, there's also a dash which functions as a parry and lets you counter attack. Secret areas are common and the game really encourages you to explore. Absolutely worth the price of admission.",

The Narrator is enjoyable even when you make him go crazy when you refuse to obey him.  Alot of the achievements are well thought out. Had to go out of my way to get some of them.   Game never felt cheap, sure there are some difficult bosses, but nothing that cant be handled with proper knowledge of the games functions. ICEY's just dodge make a lot of tough enounters a joke. and speaking of Combat, Combat is fluid, never felt clunky. Every enemy has a flaw that can be used to strike that critical blow. Even when they started throwing previous bosses at me as regular enemies, there wasnt a single time i felt like i wasnt in control.  Lots of hidden goodies and even hidden dialogue if you decide to go off the beaten path. Hell the narrator will scold you for doing so. but theres not much he can do aside from get mad. Some hidden goodies lead to different endings, all of which you have to do to see the 'true ending'.   Game is very colorful, ICEY herself is a site to behold as her body modifications dimly glow, even in combat when you're dashing around turning enemies into scrap the art direction looks stunning. Had very few if any frame drops.  Challange factor is there as well, i did a full playthrough on normal difficulty. (Which took around 5.2 hours to 100%) And there were times that i actually felt challanged but never felt as if i couldnt win. Aside from a completely optional boss in the opra house.  My only real gripe is that it felt to short. But man was it Worth playing, right now its like 10 bucks on steam, its worth getting.",

I enjoyed each boss battle (Jack was my favorite) and I really liked that you could go back and fight them again if you wanted to. The ost is outstanding and really kept me interested. A rather short game though. If you follow the narrators instructions to the letter I reckon the average gamer could finish in 2-3 hours. The most interesting factor about this game is it's Stanley Parable-esque storytelling (lacking an English narrator, but I'm okay with subtitles). Unexpected in a Hack n' Slash but it works out pretty well, giving you little asides from the main story.   8/10",

Good:  Fluid combat (even though a bit simple) Funny narrator (if you know Chinese and those references)   However, I strongly suggest a revised script for a good English voice over (and also get a better ICEY voice heh?)",

            "review_text": "The visuals are stunning! Buy it!  ICEY is a great game. While the game can be short, especially if you take certain shortcuts: the gameplay is both compelling and the storytelling offer great replayability.  Combat in the game is aesthetically pleasing and very satisfying. While, as others have pointed out, that you can bait the dash-counterattack to great effect to easily beat every boss and mob in the game, mastering the combat system clears it much faster and in a much more satisfying and visually appealing manner.  While the voice-actor is speaking in Chinese, they convey the story well. There is the innevitable translation problems where it probably sounds much more fitting in the native tongue as opposed to whats on the subtitles. Regardless, it is fairly well done.  The game does have an issue of linearity though. While it does offer numerous branches and fair diversity following the main story, the branches themselves are usually one-way forward, occassionally allowing a second option. While this isn't really a problem, it's something of note.  I enjoyed my time playing this game and it was well worth the price.",
