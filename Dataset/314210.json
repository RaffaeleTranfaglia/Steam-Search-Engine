    "description": "Classic 2D platforming that blends elements of: Nikola Tesla, puzzles, inventions, 1800's-era undead and a sprinkling of the maniacal Thomas Edison. Throw in a dash of randomly generating level sectors, a zesty squeeze of items and a pinch of indie love... Tasty!",

            "review_text": "Tesla breaks my heart. I really wanted to like this game. The art style is gorgeous, the music is on point, the snarky narrator is great, the premise of the story is pure gold. But the controls of movement, guns and other gadgets, feel unresponsive, sluggish. That would be just fine if the focus were on the puzzles, but the randomly generated levels often put you in situations where damage is unavoidable and would require responsive, fast platforming controls to get through. Constant spawning of zombies, camera issues that obscure navigation, all conspire to make Tesla Breaks the World! a rather frustrating (infuriating even) experience.",

            "review_text": "On sale for $2, it seemed like even a game with less than stellar reviews would be worth a shot, and how do you go wrong with Tesla?  God how I was wrong. Right off the bat, the game has no intuitive feel to it. Most of the few levels I could deal with was fighting zombies, but the way you do so is that you effectively grab one zombie in your gun, then shoot that zombie at another. There's a whole realm of issues with that. First of all, there's a long animation of the zombies coming out of the ground before they can be interacted with. Then there's that when you do use this, the zombies bounce straight back at you so if you're remotely close to the zombie you're shooting, you end up getting hurt by your own shot. 'That can easily be avoided by not being close to the zombie' you say. Well, the field of view is so small, and so much of this involves narrow platforms, that that is an incredibly difficult thing to pull off. Plus, there's a max range for the gun, so it limits you to relatively close quarters combat with something that is distinctly not close quarters suitable.  The view is also a huge issue because it means it is extremely difficult to see where you're trying to go, especially leaping from ledges, as a large part of the time, there are jumps that one makes just presuming there will be something to land on when you get there. This could be forgivable if not for the fact that it seems like the terrain is semi-randomly generated, and so each time you die, you end up in a new landscape so you face the same issues time and time again, rather than at least being able to learn the particulars of the level.  The game has, theoretically, checkpoints, but with how poor the level design is, it feels like there should be more checkpoints. It also should correspond much more to events, as, for example, you find a pigeon to help you, but that's in the middle of a long stretch with no checkpoints, so finding that, going on a ways, then dying meant having to go get the pigeon over and over again, rather than having a checkpoint where one finds the pigeon in what I'd consider a more reasonable manner.  If this game is on sale at it's full price, don't buy it. If it's on sale, don't buy it. If someone offers it to you for free, decline.",
