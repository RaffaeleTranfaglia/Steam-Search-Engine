            "review_text": "Probably one of my worst game purchases ever.  Bought this because all the reviews were positive at the time I added this to my cart. Apparently this was supposed to be an old-school point-n-click adventure game, and being a fan of this genre (been playing since the '80s) I couldn't wait to try this one out.  Sadly, the horrible - and I mean   horrible   - English put me off so much that I just couldn't bring myself to continue playing. Whole sentences need revision, and the vocabulary is so,  so  bad that it's face-contortingly jarring. And it doesn't help that there's a relatively large amount of reading and text involved.  Add to that a very amateurish feel to the whole thing ( this game plays like something that should be free ), and unoriginal, uninspired puzzles that have extremely poorly written instructions (not that they're needed - you can figure things out on your own, but why write instructions when they're incomprehensible and would be of no help to anyone?), a tired, badly put-together, barely there,  somewhat-of-a -storyline, and I seriously wonder how this game got greenlighted.  And the movement makes absolutely no sense - screens roll up and down, when you're supposed to be walking forwards or backwards respectively. Why?!  Oh, and objects aren't labelled, and there's no way of telling if they're 'active' or not.  All in all, this game feels like some 9-year-old kid made it in his spare time.   This game should be free. And even then, I would not recommend it.",
