Once you start you it’s difficult to stop. + good graphics and sound + not frustrating to play + replay ability by unlocking higher difficulty settings The more you play, the more stars you collect to upgrade your plane – this element of the game is important otherwise you will have problems in the later levels. It plays perfectly with an XBOX 360 controller. I highly recommend this game if you like shoot 'em ups you will not be disappointed!",

            "review_text": "I liked this game quite a bit until I got to Stage 5. The difficulty spiked up about 200% and I'm going to have to grind earlier levels quite a bit to get enough upgrades to pass it, I'm afraid. This game was originally a mobile game, as I've recently discovered, so that's probably why it has such horrendous difficulty spikes. There's no cash shop though, so you just have to grind your way through the upgrades to progress if you're not a 14-year old with superhuman reflexes.  And that's the problem with this game. I don't mind a little grinding, I'm an old-school MMO player. Back in my day, grinding's all we had and we liked it!  In this game, to unlock later stages requires you to earn badges in previous stages. Badges are granted for things like killing Y% of the enemies or collecting Z% of the coins, getting through the level without getting hit, picking up all the civilians scattered around, etc. Once you get all four badges on Easy, it unlocks a tougher difficulty for that stage with a new set of badges. To get a stage unlocked you have to have completed the previous level AND you have to have collected X number of badges.  As you go through the game collecting coins, you can spend those on upgrades for your ship. This adds a neat RPG like progression system. The graphics are nice, the music is cool, the gameplay is smooth, but once I hit Stage 5 it wasn't fun anymore. What's wrong with Stage 5? There's this nasty energy pulse that chases you the whole time. If it hits you, you lose all ability to fire weapons and you just have to skate through the rest of the level not getting hit. Not fun. Or you can keep running from it, which means you have to juke and move CONSTANTLY, which makes aiming at enemies and picking up civilians quite a bit more difficult. Sometimes you need to go left to dodge a projectile, but that's where the energy orb is so you can't go that way. Ugh, it's just frustrating.  So, I'm giving this a thumbs down. It's too grindy, has huge difficulty spikes (I think because of its mobile P2W origins), and frustrating mechanics.",

            "review_text": "This game is ridiculously fun when playing with a friend. However, now that the LAN I bought this for is over, I find it incredibly difficult to play. I don't mind a bit of a challenge but it's difficult to the point of not being very fun when you try to beat the later levels or complete some of the challenges by yourself. There is also a level half way through where they take away all of your guns and that level is terrible even with a friend.  For a game that is so much fun with a friend, I hope they add online co-op. I would then consider changing my answer. If you mostly play solo, I would NOT recommend this game.",

I don't know how they came up with screenshots that have so many bullets in them. Another bad thing in the game is that instead of making enough maps so your upgrades grow stronger while completing missions, they make you repeat the already finished maps to collect the stars (money) to buy the upgrades. The game is somewhat entertaining even with the flaws mentioned, but there are better alternatives to spend your money on.",

            "review_text": "Fun game, but... No co-op like they say it has. For the life of me I can't get second player on the game. It keeps saying 'Press A for second player' and no matter how many times I press 'A', I never get a second player. Frustrating.  I didn't realize that it was 'local Co-op' and not 'co-op' so bought a game for my sons account. I chalk that up to my skipping over that part in the description so I don't fault the game for that. I missed that in the description. But, I do fault the game for not allowing the second player to play for local co-op, we tried to salvage the evening by just playing it on my computer with the 22 inch monitor. We ended up going with another game after wasting too much time getting the second player plane to show up.  [See edit below] I would recommend it if you don't ever, and I mean ever, plan on playing it in co-op mode. Although, that said, why not just get the game for your phone for free. The only reason I got this for the PC was so my son and I could play together.  Edit:  The only thing I would change in my above review would be that I got it working with the controller. But my recommendation still stands based on: 1. no keyboard-keyboard local co-op 2. no keyboard + mouse co-op 3. each time a new round starts does the controller get red or purple? Roll the dice and prepare to get confused. It drove me nuts because I would get used to red and then next round I was purple. WTH? I'm still using the controller and my son is still using the keyboard. Why the switching up of colors? I finally figured out the pattern to somewhat get the same color most of the time. But still kinda stupid. 4. no auto fire for the controller plane. So I sit there with my thumb mashed down for minutes at a time. Talk about thumb fatigue. The keyboard plane gets auto fire, why does the other one need you to fatigue your thumb. Lame. 5. no useful information in the help file. There was nothing in there about a controller being required for the game. 6. I'm still looking for where it says in the game description that a controller is required for second player. Still haven't found it. I definitely would not have purchased the game for me and my sons account had I known this.  Now, to be fair, I do like the game on my phone. I easily gave it a 5 star review on Google Play as it deserved it. But I just can't in good faith give a recommendation for a $10 game on a PC that falls this short. I've paid far less and received far more in other games. I guess I got suckered in on a game on the phone and thought it would be equally as fun on the PC, and I think it could be with the proper forethought in gameplay/interfacing.  I know I'll get flamed for this review, but in hindsight I would not have purchased the game knowing what I know above. Or at least I would have seriously hesitated. So because of that I'm leaving this review to help other gamer's make an educated decision.",

Challenges are fun. But announcer is getting annoying after awhile. Muting is not allowed. Also you can not pick a plane or modify your plane visually. It's always red. 9 stages are not enough. Like i said, it is a retro game without modern touch except graphics. You should buy the game,no matter what. It is so fun:D",
