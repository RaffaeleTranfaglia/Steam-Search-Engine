            "review_text": "I'll admit that this 'game' isn't for me, but I'm writing this review to get more talented people working on this. This game (sandbox) is a precursor to 'Worlds Adrift' by having players design islands for players to fight over. The tools are very comprehensive, and some truly amazing sky-islands have already been made. I expect to see some high-quality stuff when the full game comes out.  I don't actualy like it, though, do I recommend this sandbox? Well, it's simple: I know that many other people will enjoy this immensely. I prefer my beauty to either require struggle. The most 'beautiful' game I ever played was either Call of Juarez: Gunslinger (which can be pretty hard at points) or Subnautica (where the most beautiful parts were either fraught with danger, or very hard to reach in the first place). WA: Island Creator doesn't really do that. The maps are all good, some of them are just better, so I find it hard to enjoy the beauty of the game. There isn't any effort involved on my part. Imagine easting by having foor teleported into your stomach. Would eating still be fun? No, not realy. That's how I see it, at least. If you're the kind of person who went on all the field trips to art museums at school, this might be for you.",

            "review_text": "Uhm... No. Not in its current state. It needs to be optimized. It needs improvement all around. Tools are clunky, unresponsive or over-responsive. Where is the water? Performance is terrible considering the poor level of detail you can get from this. Graphics are indeed lackluster. For this kind of performance hit, I'd expect to see something decent on my screen. Can't recommend this at the present. To make things worse, these guys are essentially releasing sub-par tools and asking the community to do the heavy lifting. If you want me to do any heavy lifting, you need to give me something worthy of the effort. I've used too many world-builders, terrain generators, and similar tools to find this program remotely acceptable. I want waterfalls pouring off the sides of my island. I want sun-shafts filtering through the trees. I want something more. Too quick to rush something into release. Same problem a lot of devs have it seems these days.",

This game actually looks great but I can't play it because it just crashes over and over again. I gave it about five chances but none of them made any improvements. Is it just my computer or the game? It also comes up with a message saying: Oops! The game crashed! The crash report folder named '2016-08-093132' next to game executable.    HELP ME PLEASE! I really really wanna play this game so badly.",

            "review_text": "I have anxiously been waiting for Worlds Adrift to announce a release date for the full game, since I first heard about it months ago. I was lucky enough to get in on some NA test servers, and after getting a chance to play a version of the full game I have been thirsty for more. The Island Creator is one of the best ideas I have ever seen a developer release to it's fans. It's beneficial to the developers in many ways, and it allows people a small taste of the game before it is released. It's also free, which gives me a good feeling about the developers, and the direction that they are taking for the game, and how they want to interact with fans of the game.  That being said the Island Creator is really fun. It gives you alot of creative tools to work with, and ton's of freedom to use your own creativity. The developers are also updating it and adding new usefull features all the time. The other great thing is that Bossa Studios have been activly listening to their fans, and gathering feedback about the Island Creator, and ways to improve it. It amazes me that a development team is so responsive and in touch with it's fan base, that they actually care to hear opinions about a small side project of the full game. They even have been showcasing some of the Islands on Twitch that they like.  I can't wait for the full game to be released, but at least I have something to mess around with until then.   If your thinking about downloading this, just do it. It's free, and super fun to play around with. If you have used any 3d modeling suite like Blender, You will understand the controls right off the get go. It is pretty intuitive, and easy to figure out how everything works. I have a fairly powerful computer with a 980Ti, so I don't know how well it runs on weaker systems. It runs very well on my system.  Thanks Bossa, I appreciate you releasing this tool to the public. It is pretty epic.",

            "review_text": "I have been looking at this game with passing interest for some time now, and only happened to notice this island creator had showed up on the workshop. It was free, so I decided to try it out. Normally I'm not a very artistic type, but I found that just playing with some of the tools actually allowed me to make some interesting, dare I say pleasant landscapes without much effort at all from mass-placement and -texture tools. And given all of the other more precise options, I can see this being a very powerful tool to others to make some really neat locales. The idea that players could make these to be in the final game is a really incredible idea, so if you're following this game, you really should try it out in my opinion.   Additionally, with the option to try out your islands as a player, it makes this a really neat insight into some of the early mechanics of the game. For once, the grappling rope actually impacts obstacles, and overall the physics seem to be building toward a fun game. (Side Note - you CAN reel in the grappling hook with the SHIFT key, took be a bit to figure that out.)  Overall, this is a really fun, free tool with a lot of impications for players, and should definitely be checked out if you're interested in this game. In my opinion, this free demo shows a lot of promise for the game as a whole, and definitely piqued my interest in it that much more.",
