Instead of the rotating world sideways game mechanic that fez has poncho has a move forward &amp; backward thing (which is still rather unique &amp; cool) &amp; instead of wearing a fez you wear a poncho lol.  Last level was worth getting to the end for, was pretty lol &amp; a few moments there was like omg the game is trolling me!   Overall, the game was kinda half way there for me &amp; just felt like too much of a fez gimmick. Does not do the game any justice by being compared to fez as fez is such an awesome game. 5.8/10.",

Puzzles and challenges lie around every corner and although some of them can be tricky, sometimes a leap of faith will solve all of your problems! During my time playing the game so far I have thoroughly loved the gameplay mechanics as well as the music in particular, the music for each level matches perfectly with the visuals and gameplay making the experience so enjoyable itâ€™s hard to put Poncho down.",
