More importantly, the host of bugs that leave the final product quality trapped in what should rightly be the early development phase are now permanent, since Ubisoft has long since stopped providing any fixes or customer support for it. I don't blame them; no one likes to be repeatedly reminded about their shoddy workmanship. On the other hand, they shouldn't be asking money for it either.  Thanks to insanely die-hard fans of the series, there are numerous mods available online to improve the game. Still, you shouldn't have to clean up someone else's mess. Stick to SH 3 and 4, two really nice games for this genre.",

The game runs smoothly and I've never had a problem with my saves. Other than that it runs fantastic and is pretty difficult at times.    Tbh I'm not sure if it's because I have a Uplay account prior to this and understood the hoops to jump through to play the game with out modding it or any of the fussy stuff keeps saying in the comments.   Maybe It's the fact that my computer is as old as most of the kids in elemetary these days who play COD on late nights till their mom tells em to gtfo.  Either way, if you're looking for a bit more immersive Sub experice then get this one other wise just get the safer purchase of SH4.   8/10 Could have added more varity to the whole ship and better communcations with other subs.",

But Ubisoft Poland dropped the ball by removing everything that made Silent Hunter great. There's no level of customization of crew and equipment anywhere near the older versions. There's no developing your crew, or betterment of your men, instead you get derpy yellow ! quest giver's without quests who just repeat the same lines about their family, and usually bug out and insist they have something new to say but repeat the same thing. This could have been great, the graphics are really good for it's era, even still, but the let down is in the depth and the missions. You'd think removing ALL the customization and RPG aspects would have been to allow them to add more missions and more game depth, but nope. Oh, and all versions are censored German versions where nothing historic will be depicted on your otherwise authentic U-boat.",

Right out of the gate it wouldn't even load because UPlay reported that some Ubisoft service was down. I finally worked around that by downloading UPlay from Ubi's website and launching it that way. The tutorial in this game is horrible -- it shows you how to shoot at surface targets that don't move. It doesn't enable control panels that you're supposed to use during the tutorial. At no point does it teach you about diving your submarine, how to operate submerged (i.e. running out of oxygen, depleting your batteries, etc). The first mission brief after the tutorial asked me to choose one of two missions and neither one was available to select on the map. After restarting the campaign a few times they finally showed up so I selected one where I needed to sink some merchant vessels. While on that mission I surfaced my submarine but the game thought I was still submerged (even though I'm walking around on deck). Because the game thinks I'm submerged my deck crew won't come up topside and my CO2 is continuing to accumulate. After sinking a few ships I check my mission status and find that it has not recorded any of my kills as progress towards the mission goal.   I spent more time restarting, saving/loading, and searching forum posts for workarounds than I spent actually playing the game. This is not even an alpha game at this stage.",

My first silent hunter was number 3 and then bought 4 and the uboat expansion. uplay has only given me 1 problem but the auto saving in this game helps if you forget to save on your own. I do enjoy being able to walk around your submarine but i still wish it had shotcuts to the different positions for faster reactions.( I bet mods have put that in). In my opinion this game is easier and harder then the other silent hunters. easier in that in the hours i have played I have not experianced 1 dud torpedo and a lot of my kills are are only involving 1 torpedo, unlike the other games were it mostly takes 2 and 3 for the bigger ships. but it is more challenging in the part were there are many more destoryers in this game in my opinion and do a fairly good job at hunting you down. also a trillon planes off the coast of brittan that bomb the crap out of me. For me this game is great without any mods, and probably better with them. but like I said the only parts about the game I dont like is there is not any postion short cuts and your flack and deck gunner crews are almost pointless and you should do it your self 100% of the time.",

Sadly, this game does NOT live up to the high standards set by its predecessors.  The main flaws include the following: Uplay DRM to play the game. Game-breaking bugs and flaws that will sometimes prevent you from even progressing, or on occasion, will reset your progress to a much earlier point. -Examples of this include:  -When opening the periscope view the game instantly crashes to desktop with no crash dump, report, or warning.  -Some enemy units will disappear in full view of the player without explanation or warning.  -Certain story objectives are not acomplishable due to the game not tallying kills properly.  The main reasons to enjoy your time in this game: All gamebreaking bugs aside, the game looks beautiful, and is a good platform for mods (assuming you are allowed to, I wouldn't know as I have only played the stock game). The mechanics from the old Silent Hunter games are somewhat present, but the game is much easier than it's predecessors.  Overall: Don't buy this game, buy Silent Hunter IV or Silent Hunter III ",
