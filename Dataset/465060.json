    "description": "A sequel that isn’t afraid to be different. EXZEAL is the followup to TRIZEAL Remix, but it’s much more than a simple rehash. Choose between multiple ships and specialize in each one’s weapon system. Will you focus on shooting, shot charging, or close-range attacks? In EXZEAL, it’s your choice.",
