            "review_text": "This is an average tower defense, for 1.25€ it was an OK game. If it is above the average free browser TD, it's way below the best PC game in the genre like Defense Grid or Plant vs Zombie. On most levels you cannot build paths with your towers and are limited to a few emplacements. And with only 7 tower types, some of which are only unlocked in the 2nd half of the campaign. This gives for little variations and low replayability. Basically you use similar tactics on most levels.  There are a few neat ideas, the campaign plot which follow the historical events, perks, customizable towers, surprise events. But in the end they didn't add that much.  15 hours to complete the campaign on medium difficulty. Hard difficulty don't add much. With all perks unlocked, the game balance is partly broken. And with the proper perks replaying the campaign on hard was actually easier than the first playthrough on medium difficulty. Decent for a low price but there are much better TDs available.",

            "review_text": "iBomber Defense Pacific begrudgingly earns a thumbs up from me even though a 'meh' would probably be more appropriate. The game is tower defense game ported from mobile platforms. It takes place in the pacific theater in WW2 where you fight the Japanese in land, air and sea battles. There are predetermined spots in each level where you can place defenses to repel the enemy forces (kind of like Kingdom Rush, but usually with greater concentration of hardpoints).  First the positives. The game is probably the most strategic tower defense game I have played. There are inter dependencies between the turrets so you probably want to place them in certain configurations to maximize your income and/or damage output. So also need to pick from various perks (Fallout'esqe) and turret upgrades so your strategy on a given level can potentially change based on that. The game also lets you fast forward time and pause it if you wish; if you pause the game, which is slightly unconventional, you can redirect your turrets adding a strategic element (ie, 'micro') that many other titles lack.  As for the negatives, the graphics are somewhat bland, but I guess acceptable. I found it really hard to tell the difference between enemy units so it is sometimes tough to prepare sufficiently until your turrets have engaged the enemy. My bigger gripe is that this game is $4.99 on steam vs $1.99 on the Play store. Why the PC gamer gouging that seems so prevalent with mobile game developers? Sick of these companies who do a PC release as an afterthought and still charge a big premium.  ",

            "review_text": "Yet another Tower Defense game and i belive there are more to come!  Ibomber Defense Pacific is a Typical TD game and a sequal from the Ibomber franchise (which i have had the pleasure of not playing). I cant realy tell whats so amazing and diffrent from other TD games but it is a Solid TD Game.  The Mechanic in the game is no more than place diffrent tower with diffrent specific skills to prevent enemys from reaching your Base! The towers you get to Place is the Turret a fast shooting but low dmg output, The Cannon with long range and heavy damage but slow, We got the bomb tower which slowly generate bombs that you can drop anywhere on the map, The Flamethrower who burns and slows enemys. The Comm's towers who increases the range of other towers and provides extra income. the Missile tower who shoots medium hige damage in an area (works best in straight lines). and the last tower the Anti Air tower.  During the Missions or maps you can complete secondary objectives often killing crates or buildings on the map or defend specific objects! After the mission is complete you are awarded with points which you use to uppgrade your tower. you get more points if you complete the secondary objective and/or if you dont leak and all your towers survived.  There is also a Level progression in the game where you earn some xp after each mission, the only important thing about this is that you can unlock some perks to your own benefit. The game alows you to use up to 3 perks, the perks can increase your starting money of each level or boost the defense of your tower etc. it does help sometimes and it gives you a reason to continue play to advance in rank and increase score.  The Whole Game is good for an TD and the difficult level is well balanced through the game, but i dont think it is an amazing game.. the game whould be good on a mobile phone to kill time when your not close to your PC. I would rate this game 4/10... i dont like TD games! ",

GFx 8-10 SFx 8-10 Gameplay 10-10  The gameplay is easy to understand but harder to master but dont worrie as you level up it gets easier to beat those levels in glorious victory. Grafix is nice for the eyes and fits the game nicely. SFx and music is nice.  I recommend this game as it gets addictive to beat your friends scores and to level up and put more perks to your army.",
