            "review_text": "Banished is a distillation of what a lot of city-building fans missed from newer SimCity games. It’s a smart, fun twist on the concept -- instead of ruling over a metropolis through a mayor’s lens, you play a more intricate role in the development of a small colony. Every citizen is somebody you can see and control (though not directly), and your role is to see that your citizens are well-fed, happy, and warm through the long winters. The result is a more nuanced and satisfying game than the EA flagship franchise which inspired it.  Every Banished game starts on a randomly generated map, where you control a small band of settlers (about 10 adults and 10 children) who have ostensibly been banished from wherever they came from. You have nothing but the minimal supplies they carried with them, and the resources of the land around you. Your first objective is to survive the coming winter, which you can do by building houses, creating a source of food (a fishing dock or gatherer’s hut would do), and a source of heat for winter (firewood). All of these things require resources such as lumber, stone, and iron, which your citizens can scrounge from the land around them.   After the first winter, your options explode. The basic idea is to increase the population of your town by building homes, while balancing the basic needs of the citizens with the resources required for those needs. Every citizen in your town is a resource as well; the player personally assigns jobs to accomplish every task, and must make sure their labor force is well balanced and not spread too thin. Should the population dip and you no longer have enough farmers, for instance, the consequences can be dire.  All of this may sound a little daunting, and it can be, but Banished provides a helpful tutorial at the outset to ease the difficulty curve a bit. I was able to get rolling with my city and survive my first winter with its help. The mechanics are satisfying and relatively deep, although after 20 hours or so I found myself finding a groove and more or less following a formula for increasing the population of my town. It was still fun to see my town sprawl across the map (which can be sizeable), but the gameplay got a bit tired.  Banished does come with robust mod support and for those who find themselves growing tired of the gameplay, there is an extensive library of mods which breathe new life into the game. Colonial Charter is a large mod which adds an incredible amount of new content and greatly extends the life of Banished. It’s great to see mod support for a game like this, and it’s a shining example of why we should see more mod support for games going forward.  Overall, I’d recommend Banished to anyone pursuing that city simulation itch, but finding themselves disappointed with recent EA offerings. Populations of your city won’t rocket into the millions, but the level of control and visibility into the workings of the simulation is very satisfying. It’s a game which, while probably inspired by games like SimCity, does plenty to establish itself in this genre with new ideas.",

            "review_text": "Banished strips the complexities of the city-building genre to their essentials. Shining Rock Software has rolled the genre back to the middle ages. There's no sewer system to manage, no power grid to maintain. Just a group of settlers pushing into the wilderness, and a wilderness that pushes back.This simplicity creates a focused game in Banished. It starts as an intimate simulation and grows to be a taut, strategic experience.  Banished feels more like a survival simulation than a traditional city builder. I was plopped into the middle of the wilderness with a dozen people and some supplies, which they immediately began consuming. The race was on to clear enough land to plant crops and build houses before winter.  Each step in this arduous process is shown off by delicate animations that give life to the individual tasks. And each of those animations has a one-to-one relation to the city's production. Ask a citizen to fell a tree, and watch as they chop it down, carry back and deposit a single wood resource into the town's storage. Banished's towns look like a busy little ant colonies from afar, but all the activity is something more. The game rewards careful study, and those rewards made me begin to care about my little citizens.  At the expense of making laborers anonymous, Banished provides an enormous amount of control over their virtual lives. The game's mechanics are closely tied to the cycle of the seasons, so in the spring and early summer I shifted everyone into the fields for planting. In the autumn I pulled laborers out of the mines to bring in the harvest. With such high-level strategy driving my decisions, I felt like a leader, not just a deity pushing at abstracted levers. While I couldn't get to know my citizens as individuals, I had control over their lives.   This worked perfectly until the mid-game, where the simulation gets tedious. Once I pushed the population over 50 workers it became less about dictating the free time of each individual and more about the careful accounting of performance of the population as a whole. But at this level of gameplay, Banished struggles with giving players solid feedback on their actions. For instance, a gatherer will roam the area around town and carry back little baskets of roots and berries. But when the forest has been picked clean they just mutely wander. You have to zoom in, below the trees, and check to see if their hands are full. When you're tracking a small population of workers on a one-to-one basis, this is fine. When the population has ballooned, it becomes a major frustration.  The struggle for information makes Banished especially difficult at points. As I swung wildly from feast to famine and back again, lots of people were left cold and hungry. Entire towns died off before I had an understanding of how to cycle through methods of generating food in order to reliably collect enough to make it through each winter. And even then it was more guesswork than fact; let's try hunting more this year, fishing more the next. While future towns benefitted from my experience, Banished put me through an emotional wringer to earn any pride I felt for my little ant farm.  My only comfort during these tough times was to zoom into the gorgeous fully 3D world. Banished looks phenomenal, and it ran without a hitch at maximum settings, even in the late game when my town of nearly 200 began to sprawl across several screens. At such a large scale Banished resembles a little clockwork machine with hundreds of tiny parts. And as the movement began to slow, the complexity of the simulation allowed me to easily pull off the gears and reassemble them in clever ways. When a disaster, say an infestation of insects, began to attack the crops, I pulled workers from the quarry to quickly bring in the harvest. At the same time I repositioned workers from the coal mine to clear more land for fast-growing, alternative crops. It was a joy to find that sometimes my improvised solutions even worked.  Banished demands your attention. It's a game that shows instead of tells, and at times I wish it had told me more. I failed over and over again as I got my bearings. But the grand scale of those failures just made my improvements feel all the more genuine. Past the steep learning curve and trial-and-error gameplay of Banished lies a methodically crafted labor of love that is as precise as it is thrilling.",

            "review_text": "Recently i spent quite some time in this game to form some opinion.   For a long time i was looking for a city-building game what is closest to Travian. If you are familiar with this browser game, you are awesome. If you are not, dont worry just check it out, to get some sense what i am going to talk about.   In Travian you start with main building, some resources, you have couple citizens and you try to build and grow your city.  Banished is in some sense just like that. Yes i know you can´t build army here and be victorious in this way, but me personally i didn´t care about armies in Travian. My biggest pleasure was build my city, take care of my people, to trade and stuff.  I can do this in Banished, with higher level of survivability, where my decision what to build and when to build matter more. I have to take bigger care about my people. Not only i have to be sure they have enough food, they need to be warm in winter, they need suitable living conditions and so on. You also need to pay attention to age of your citizens and you need to make sure you have replacement for them when they die, so you wont end up with a ghost town. Resource management is also big plus for me, as well as current diversity in buildings. I adore tone and theme of this game and so far it was nothing but fun for me. I am aware of a fact that in some point i can get bored, and that replayability might not be case of this game when you fully master all mechanics, and when you find some solid path to build your hamlet to magnificent town.  I dont have really much bad things to say if any.  I love it, and i will for some time.  9/10",

            "review_text": "This game caught me a bit by surprise, with my purchase entirely decided by an intense longing to play Settlers 2 again, and that it looked very pretty. It's about making Medieval civilization in the wilderness, starting with a group of twenty hardened fiends who have been BANISHED (the game doesn't say what for but I think murders), and seeing how big you can get. There's no external military threats, it's just a question of if you can balance your expansion, production, transportation and all that other stuff that makes a town tick, without everyone dying. Pure sandbox, no aim in mind beyond what you want to set yourself.  My first few settlements predictably toppled over, when we ran out of food/firewood/clothes/all of the above, but eventually I settled into a nice, soothing rhythm of building and consolidating. Stuff takes time to happen, so you can't charge around building farms and smithies and whatnot, you get there gradually, and with planning. Secure basic food, fuel and shelter in the first year, scavenge materials, plant trees, open a smithy a few years in, maybe barter for some chickens, a few more houses, a bridge over a stream...seasons tick by at a leisurely pace while you think about what you want to do in the next decade, or how you're going to create enough food to support the next twenty people.  It's not frantic, and once you know what you're doing there's not much that can surprise you, but sometimes you just want to do that, build up your little decorative fishtank of farmers and quarrymen. I think what it sets out to do, it accomplishes excellently, but the lack of surprise and novelty will (I think) stop me playing in the long run. There's nothing grandiose to shoot for, like Pharaoh's monuments, there's no pressing reason to keep expanding. Beyond occasional gimmicky disasters, you're mostly going to be staring at the streets, weighing up whether a tunnel would be a good use of stone, and adjusting the worker distribution to pump out a few more iron tools.  It's relaxing, it's reasonably deep, it's pretty, just don't expect too much in the way of an epic saga and you won't be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "Let me just say right off the bat that if Banished were a game of SimCity's scale, it would definitely land into my 'top five favorite city-builders' list. And maybe it will, once mod support is finally added.  If  it's actually added. Dear god, please just add it. It's going to lead to amazing things, I know it.  So what are we dealing with here? You've probably seen the words 'city-builder', 'survival' and 'strategy' words getting tossed around. Imagine SimCity set in medieval times, but on a much lesser scale. Remember Stronghold 1? Take the economic aspect out of that. Add Children of the Nile to the mix, minus all the monkeys. Splice those suckers together. Bam! You get Banished.  If that sounds exciting to you, then by all means, go nab the game. But first be aware that:  -  There are no quests, no war, no enemies, no money, no research . It's pure and simple 'build' and 'survive', or 'build to survive' in this case. Also trade weed for chickens! Exciting. -  There are randomly occuring disasters to spice up the gameplay,  but the rate at which they happen remains a complete mystery to me. My last hard game had none occur during the 50 years span. My normal game before that had two tornadoes in a row. Ho hum. -  All in all, this game doesn't have much to offer : if you're familiar/experienced with the genre, there's a good chance that it'll only take you a few playthroughs to figure out the game's mechanics and grow a large town, at which point it becomes a very tedious experience... Until you start anew. -  Finally, there's no end and no goal . If you really MUST have that sense of 'accomplishment', you're gonna have to resort to achievement hunting, or set your own goals.  BUT!  -  There's STILL a considerable amount of depth  in this game. The only way to truly succeed is through careful management, strong infrastructure and a wee bit of luck. Do you enjoy bossing tiny pixel people around? Then boy oh boy, is this the game for you. -  It is ridiculously addicting , so you better get some coffee before tapping that play button. Don't say I didn't warn you. -  The lack of a goal is not necessarily a bad thing.  While it may sound off-putting, that's where your imagination comes to play. There's not much room for roleplaying here, but planning your village's layout and dealing with terrain obstacles on each newly generated map is fun and exciting, like in any sandbox game. -  IT WAS MADE BY ONE PERSON, FOR GOD'S SAKE , so mad props for that!  My verdict? I certainly got my money's worth here. Good city sims are a rare sight nowadays, and the (hopefully) upcoming mod kit just might improve the game tenfold with the help of community. So good luck, and full speed ahead.",

The game is extremely punishing to those who go in there thinking 'Oh it's just like Sim City' lol. No, it isn't. This game is very detailed in almost every aspect to how your town is from the overall health of your citizens, happiness, and, how many jobs are there avaiable as well as citizens.   I mean seriously this game has a graph to keep track of progress of every little thing from resources, to population, to supplies. This game is very well informative. Plus the tutorials are also a big help. The developers really put a lot of hard work into the game. Just make sure you keep your citizens happy and use critical thinking skills in applying to the needs of your citizens and you should be fine :)  Plus this game has a modding community behind it. To make the game better or slightly easier for newcomers to the game.  The only downside to this game is the overall 'disasters' In this game it's either natural (tornadoes, fires) or medicial (diseases, and such). With that being said, The game doesn't have any bandits, wolf attacks, or neighboring towns for you to take over. Lol, yes i know what your thinking 'But um this is a building city simulation. Not some sort of RTS conquest' and yes i get that. However the disasters happen rarely. Sometimes not at all. This game is a great time killer. But that is actually the problem. Lol, i want to be more active with my village. Maybe trade it with other villages that I have created, or defending my town from bandits and wolves, or take over other towns that are randomly generated on the map. Perphaps share the world space with a friend who has the game as well?  If the developers are going to make a second Banished game. I sincerely hope they add more 'disasters' in the game. It's a great start, plus the game overall should keep you busy. Not everyone will like this game because of these elements or lack of certain elements. But hey who knows maybe a modder will make something like this in the near future? So don't get your hopes up  All and all. If you like delicate city building simulations. This game is for you. ",

It's not like the Sim City games (The GOOD ones, so definetly not SIm City 2013) or Cities XL, which I do not own but I've soon my friends who love city building games play it and it looks good and they say it's amazing. No Banished is different from traditional city builders where what you build is dependent on the money you have and what poeple want. In those games you're the mayor of your town of &gt;insert name here&lt; and you are there to serve the people that move in because that's government. In Tropico you are the dictator and you have a lot more freedom though the things you do may get you in trouble and it won't take long for you to figure out what to do to succeed (Still a fun game though with a great sence of humor). In Banished, there is no one to please, no income, no hand holding and no dumbing things down just because things should be simple.  Banished adds survival and RTS elements to the city building genre. You start off with a few people, a few resourses and no real instructions (which would be nice for a few things.). It's like Minecraft, there is no shame in going online to look up information on what to do and you may end up failing many times before getting the hang of the game and even then you still need to be careful. What you end up doing is creating farms, houses, tailors, woodcutters and other jobs slowly and allocate the amount of people you want to work that job and you can even adjust the max number of people allowed to work on that location. And if your like me, at least early on, you'll find yourself constently re-allocating people depending on the season. That's another thing that this game has is the seasons which will affect things like crops. For instance, you can't grow crops when there's snow during late Autumn through Winter, so during this time you move people from growing crops to other jobs.  Now one might think that since the player relies that much on the citizen's A.I.'s, if the game is glitchy then they're screwed. And they'd be right. HOWEVER, that is not the case here. Aside from one issue I had with crops that might be due to the A.I., I never had a problem and seem to be someone who gets glitches most gamers don't get. It's so well made that when I fail I have no one to blame but myself. The game did what I asked it to but I should have done something different. This game is so optimized I've never had a problem with frame rate and it takes up such a small amount of hard drive space! I find it amazing that this game was made by one person where games like Day One: Garry's Incedent are made by a group of people and fail on things like collision and even things that can be fixed by simply changing a number. (Seriously, why can't the gun in that game kill people who are wearing nothing but a piece of cloth?) Or even big dev teams with a big name company backing them releasing broken, incomplete games (Looking at you EA).  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city building. This is a game that can end up taking a lot of time out of you day. I bought it on a Friday and Sunday night I realized that not only have I not reach year 100 yet but it's actually 1 in the morning Monday and I have homework I forgot to do. This is something that has never happened to me with any city building game. Here I really felt incharge and what I say I want my people to do they will and when I fail, it's not to a glitch or poor A.I. but to my own mistake. 'I should have had more hunters and less fisherman.' or 'Should have made my sheep farm bigger.' I'm not even really one to play these types of games because I always failed at Sim City as a child. This game has definitly held my interests and I would even say it might be worth getting when it's not on sale. (Which pretty much when I buy all my games)",

It feels like a gamer designed it, instead of a big company driving a studio to push something inferior out on an artificial deadline.  There's room for improvement, but nothing that interferes with game play or fun. This game is simply a pleasure to explore. It's only $20! Can you believe that? I can't!

            "review_text": "Okay everyone, I'm just doing a quick review of Banished to give you a general idea of whether or not you might like this game. I'm not going into deep strategies here, but I'll try to give some pro tips. Thanks for reading.  Banished is about a group of people who have been banished from their homeland and must re-establish themselves in their new land while trying to survive exposure and deprivation. It's essentially a city-builder where your enemies are time, weather, starvation, sickness, and poor planning. You start the game by setting a few basic conditions that will determine much of your fate before you even begin. In my experience, even on the easiest settings, I rarely have a group last more than 20 years. I haven't studied any strategy guides or gone into the forums much, so I'm sharing just what I've learned through the school of hard knocks.   Banished can be an unforgiving game. If you frustrate easily, you may want to give it a pass. Let me add, however, that when your strategy works, there is a sense of an actual accomplishment that many far less challenging games fail to deliver. And you're going to need some type of strategy and some luck to survive more than 7 years in many instances.  After you've made your starting choices, you hit the ground running. You can let the clock tick along fairly slowly, but where's the fun in that? Pause the game, have a quick look around, open your most critical reports and let them hang on the edge of your vision, assign initial tasks to villagers, and pump the clock up to 10x speed (if you get bored easily like me--otherwise, just let it go). You may feel an inclination to go big, but I judge that would be a mistake. Don't clear huge areas of land or build the largest farms you can in the hopes that you will survive the first winter--you probably will regardless of what you do.. but that second winter might be your end-game even so. There will be time for going big later after you've learned the basics.  Go moderate, but go quickly. Consider these as your first tasks (not necessarily in this order, but order can matter a great deal while you're learning... and even after that). Assign a few builders from among the general laborers. Clear some land. Plant some modest farms and an orchard or two. Build a place for the firewood provider to do his job. Bump up your resource limits for food and fuel. Keep the list of future tasks assigned fairly short so you can change strategies easily when you're first starting out. You'll need more storage space. You'll need more tools. You'll need more iron, stone, wood. You'll need more fuel and food. You'll need medicines, too. The list of tasks keeps rapidly expanding, but choose wisely and try for some moderation. Don't be afraid to switch people around to whatever job is most needed at the moment. Keep in mind, too, that if things get moving along in a good way, you may be faced with a population explosion that might rapidly deplete one or more essentials. If you run out of fuel or food and someone dies of old age or starvation, you may have consigned your settlement to a slow withering death, or a quick one depending upon your skill and luck.   Never give up. You may find yourself down to three people, but if they are hunting, fishing, or engaged in some other food production activity, and if they have enough fuel and other necessary items, you can bring them back from the brink. Just be careful. An abundance of good things combined with a population explosion may leave you without the resources to keep from going over the other direction--then you run out of food, your older workers die from some cause and your children are left to starve or freeze to death. Did I mention the game can be unforgiving? Or perhaps the younger ones already died, and there's nobody but the old and infirm to keep things going just a little longer. Okay, this is getting a little repetitive, but the game can be just that at times.  Banished currently has an active modding community, though the mods seem pretty much limited to tweaks: a new type of building, an improved harvest rate, better schools. Consider adding some. Using the right mods, you can change some important aspects of the game that can give you enough of an advantage that you find yourself lasting longer. However, in my experience, having a few mods does not necessarily guarantee a stroll through the park on Sunday afternoon. A few dumb mistakes could leave you without the things or people you will have to have to survive your first 5 years. Who knows? You may even decide to mod it yourself and make it just the way you'd like to play it. Or not. The choice is yours.   If you need a big pay-off, I don't think there is one. Nothing in the game gives me any sense that there is anything more to hope for than to survive and grow as a community for one more year. Also, watch out for the time dilation effects. hahaha... No, but you must seriously pay attention to the passage of time in the game because it looks like the seasons pass and only a year has gone by, but your people seem to age far more rapidly than they should. And death is always waiting for your people. Watching and waiting. It's all a delicate balance that you must maintain. Fortunately, there are tweaks for these things as well if you desire to change them.  I think that's enough to give you the general sense of how it plays and what it is. I hope that helps. Thanks again for reading. The game isn't for everyone, but it is worth playing. If you played it before, consider trying it again because, even without mods, it seems a bit easier than it did when I first purchased it--I think the developer may have taken some of the community feedback to heart, in other words.  Peace.",

            "review_text": "Banished is basically a city builder that requires you to start from scratch. Before recommending it to anyone, you have to ask yourself what type of city builder are you searching for? Below I will mention what Banished provides from a unmodded perspective.  A. Challenge - In the beginning of gameplay you will be challenged on how to keep your population alive at times. Once you learned the ropes and strategies, the challenge to keep your population alive is not that difficult. But then again I've played this game quite a bit. B. Buildings - Banished in the unmodded format provides limited buildings. If you build a stone house, then that is all it will be, a stone house. Buildings don't evolve like in a civilization style game which means the buildings stratisfy evolving into more efficiency or the graphics change with the next generation. Banished buildings stay the same unless you use mods. C. Sandbox - Banished can provide hundreds of maps you want to start from. The map seeds are practically limitless. This allows you to construct a new village/town facing various dynamics of land types, weather, and bodies of water. D. Micromanagement - One aspect to this game is you micromanage jobs, resources, crops etc etc. If you don't like micromanaging how many people are working as a farmer vs miner, then I suggest you pass this game up. A large part of this game is micromanagement. E. Modding - The game was designed to be modded. There are numerous mods out there that allow new buildings, crops, jobs, etc. etc. The only downside to modding is many mods disable the achievements.   There are some downsides to this game but it depends on your tolerance level. A. AI - The computer AI sometimes get very annoying after a bit. The computer AI is the citizens. Citizens go idle once in a while, which results in them being non-productive. An example is you are building a house, the builder almost finishes the project but then he/she goes idle and stops working. The only way to get them out of the idle phase was reload the game. B. Timesink - Expanding your village and creating a higher population takes lots of time. If you don't mind playing this game passionately for an extended period of time then no issue. On the other hand if you have limited time to dedicate to building a village up into a town, then I would think twice.  Overall, the game is fun for a while but over time, once you played it over and over, it gets kind of boring. When it is on sale I recommend buying it cheap. At full price I would say it is not worth. If you have lots of time, enjoy micromanaging a village, and understand the aspects of keeping a population alive that was banished to a land, then by all means I would recommend.",

Not to mention that, apart from an AI bug I actually prefer to keep (animals walk under water when they travel!), the game appears to be completely bug free.  I do, however, have to warn you that this is also one of the hardest in the genre. Expand too slowly and you'll be stifled by old age; expand too soon and your town will starve to death. The resource management is key, and is incredibly sensitive to fluctuation. Find yourself on a downward spiral, running out of resources? You're probably already doomed. Managed to harvest in excess? Store it up so you have a buffer zone. Not enough workers? Accept some nomads, or help your population to breed.  The game might appear to be a little shallow - once you've built all that appears in the menu, that's it - but I promise you, there's so much to this game if you're interested in making a successful, expansionist town, especially if you're after the achievements.  It's not a quickfire game either - you need lots and lots of patience to survive, and even more to master it. Before you know it, you'll have spent hours on this game without achieving much, but having grand goals for your town in mind.  Very hard to put this game down!",

You have to be careful at all times and carefully watch the interactive statistics if you would like to play it as an expert. Otherwise it's really hard to survive in most of the random generated maps with challenging conditions. (Mountains, harsh climate etc.)  Everything is so balanced in Banished, graphics are beatiful and more than enough for such a game, atmosphere is beatiful, each building has some different skins to choose from, seasons are perfectly set, climate changes are perfecty shown, economy chain is perfectly set(there is no money or gold in the game), you can see the whole life span of your citizens flow in front of your eyes(Each citizen has a unique name) and so goes on.

You could say playing Banished is 'Zen-like' because there is no overbearing external pressures - you are merely massaging your production systems for optimal output. But don't rest on your laurels - there is the ever present slow burning drain on your resources - you consume resources to live and build. If you fail to plan ahead your town will wither away: because you didn't store enough food, tools, or materials.   The first 100 citizens is an engaging challenge, but then it becomes repetitive - until you hit 300+ citizens when you start to struggle against the natural limits of expanding your large town.   Banished was developed by one man, and while I praise his talent, I can't ignore the following issues. The trading mechanic is very basic, but that is 'ok'. There is no stupid combat mechanic like in the Anno series, which is 'great'; The variety of external threats is still pretty good. The production &amp; building requirements are simple - which is bad, ok, or good depending on your love of complex systems (but this is a city builder game you are playing).   In comparison to the Anno series, Banished is very basic in many ways. Banished doesn't have the huge variety like in the Anno series (crop variety is not real variety). In Anno 2070 there are many ways to optimise your production because of the intricate production networks you create - but this is not possible in Banished (because it is all AI determined) - but this may be a good thing you prefer your city to be easily understandable.  I highly recommend Banished as a good introduction to city builders because of its almost elegant simplicity. When you get bored, which you may not, then try Anno 2070. ",

This game tests your managing skills and your ability to work out what you need and when you need it, to keep the city going. Banished is based in an era where technology is not around, so farming, tree cutting, tool making and other similar jobs are done by hand/humans. This make the game simple by there being no upgrades, however for your city to grow, you need to build more houses so the people of your town can reproduce growing your adults population which in turn creates labourers which you can use to set a direct task i.e. farmer or blacksmith, or simply leaving him/her as a labourer to collect stock from the areas around your town coal/iron etc. By evolving and building up your town, you need to make sure that it has sufficient food wood/coal to survive the winter. This game is based on seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) which is broken up into 3 sections early middle late. Surviving before during and after winter is one thing, but to survive with enough food for your town during all seasons, or being able to help the sick, or even put out fires is a constant battle. This game make take an hour or two to understand, and you may wipe out a town in a process. But this is the Banished experience. Every person play this game differently, and it is great to see how people setup their towns if you buy the game as it is only $20 and play a few hours you too will enjoy this game.",

            "review_text": "This game is great. It is solid gameplay at a fair price. It is more challenging than your standard sim because everything has direct consequences, moreso than in other sims. For instance, if let yourself run low on tools, you will quickly find that people don't work as effectively. People that don't work effectively are mining for the materials that the blacksmith makes to make the tools. So you run out of iron, coal, and logs to make tools. Farmers, hunters, and other food bearing people need these tools. So then you starve and your village becomes a ghost town, all because you let yourself run low on tools.   The game mechanics remind me of back when Stronghold was a good game, a couple releases back. There were things in Stronghold that I wish were in this game, such as taking wheat to a mill to make flour that you take to a bakery to bake bread. More of a 'tech tree', if you will. But the few elements that this game does have (metal, coal, various food types, wood, etc) are done extremely well.  Banished has some fresh ideas as well, such as crop and animal diseases, various human diseases (filthy nomads!), and schools. Regarding schools, educated villagers perform better but are a drain on resources until they graduate.  The graphics and sound are great for a game at this price point, and I only suffered one crash to desktop in my over 500 hours of gameplay.  About that.. The insane amount of time you see that I've played Banished isn't entirely accurate. One of the things I enjoyed with the game was to see if I finally created a self-sufficient, self-surviving village, and then I would go to bed and leave it running. 9.9 times out of ten I would wake up to see that I didn't think things through in one area or another, or that a tornado had come through, or my pastures were diseased, or....  If you like sim builders, and are up for a challenge, Banished is definitely for you!",

When you build farms, you don't just have a farm, you are allowed to choose between a dozen food types. Your main resources are wood, stone, iron, coal. Which you harvest in familiar ways. The options are what stand out to me in this game. Other simulations might have you build farms for every 10 people or some other fixed value. In Bansihed you have choices. Lots of choices. Lots and Lots of choices. You might start the game only knowing how to farm squash. But everntually you will be able to have over a dozen fruits, vegetables, and meats to choose from. You have farms, in the typical fashion, but you have orchards now. This allows your brewer to use any fruits, or wheat to make ales. You have fruit and nut trees. You have over a dozen food choices to from. Corn, pumpkin, squash, wheat, beans, and more. Easily worth the $20 i dropped on it. I missed it on sale for 15 by a few hours.

            "review_text": "First up - I am growing to hate this game! It is strangely, one of the most frustratingly fun/addictive games I have played in a long time. I hate it, because substantial hours of my life are going to be devoted to playing it!   The premise is this - you start off with 4-6 exiled/wandering families (from where we don't know/care) and it's your job to help guide them into starting their new life together. There's no specific time periiod given (to my knowledge) but it's when people used wells to put out fires so it's a few years back in history! You have to build the town from scratch, while at all times making sure your villagers have enough shelter, and food (and not just one food either; this isn't one of those games where everyone can live off fish for eternity, you gotta mix your meat with your fruit and veg to maintain health in the long term). This is where the problems start!    There is no researching buildings. You can build whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want, as long as you have the materials to do so. However, you have to use some advance planning in your head because while you're trying to figure out the precise place to put your town hall, one of your families may be starving or freezing to death because you haven't built a house or assigned enough fishermen/gatherers to maintain your food stocks. You also have to be careful with your raw materials because once those trees are gone, it's going to take a few years to grow new ones. Sometimes, your fatal flaw is just bad luck when a tornado comes through and tears through your cattle farm - now you have to plan for a harsh winter without the meat you were counting on!   Banished is the game every other city-building sim wants (and should aspire) to be in my humble opinion. It is not an exciting game by any means - you won't be set upon by wolves or Orcs and there is no set objective, except to help your villagers live a long and prosperous life, but once you get a good township going, he sense of achievement speaks for itself! It is city building in it's purest form!",

Unfortunately no one had a proper sex education and did not have families. instead they just grew old and frail until one day a group of immigrants came and took over the land. Many years later a tornado left a young child and a few elders stranded on an island with just enough resources to stay warm and fed for a decent amount of years.

In Banishedl, your enemy is Nature itself, along with the cruel reality of trying to survive in this harsh, unforgiving world. The learning curve will absolutely take time and likely see your people and towns die off as you fgure the game out, but at the same time it's brilliant at displaying information in a manner that is concise, relevant, and easy to consume. There aren't a thousand menus and as many things to build, which to some may appear too simplistic and dumbed-downed; however, I believe these are positives that make the game easy to approach, but very difficult to master.  There are several ways to build your town in order to fulfill your people's needs, and the game allows your to assign specialized jobs to help keep your people focused on the tasks you ned done most. Overall, this is a wonderful game that will punish you for being greedy, for trying to expand too far and too quickly, and sometimes despite all your hard work and cautious preparations, Nature comes and burns down your homes or blows away all that remains like the Big Bad Wolf.   I can see myself enjoying a great deal more time with this game, and hope to bring my people a flourishing society!",

My chickens refuse to stay in their pens and instead stand around the vilage square.

            "review_text": "Banished is sometimes peaceful, sometimes brutal, but very fun. There's something really satisfying about striking just the right balance between population growth and resources. If you're not careful and you build too fast, or make a few bad decisions, you may find yourself facing a cascading infrastructure collapse leading to a slow, painful death for your community. Use up too much wood and then they have no heat. The food workers start freezing to death, leaving the wood cutters to starve to death. Then the blacksmith runs out of wood to make tools with, and everyone's tools start breaking with no replacements. Within one season, your bustling town of 50 citizens dwindles down to 20 or less, and you're scrambling to fill essential jobs with a freezing, starving workforce. All kinds of other things can happen too. Too many kids and you can't produce enough food to feed them. Too few children and your workers die of old age with nobody to replace them. The whole game is a knife edge balancing act where the repercussions of one decision might not be apparent for an hour or so, but by then it's too late.  This is a game of suspense and tension, punctuated by moments of relaxing tranquility. At least at first. Eventually you start to get a handle on the mechanics and it becomes a little easier, but there are still random events that may happen, or surprises around the corner which you haven't adequately prepared for. As of this review I've put in over 22 hours and so far I haven't seen any major disasters, just the occassional diseased crop or fire breaking out. By now I've gotten to where I'm starting out on 'Hard' with 'Harsh' weather and I'm doing okay. My last town went from about 48 workers to 20, however, because I wasn't building enough houses and people weren't having children fast enough. Thankfully I had a Town Hall, so a group of nomads joined up and I was able to bounce back. My goal right now is to import one of every type of seed and livestock, and have farms and fields set up for each one. After that, I'm not sure if there will be too many other goals I'd have to keep playing, except perhaps to obtain a population of 500, maybe 1000. Hopefully by then the developer will have added some new building types or new mechanics to mix things up a bit.  I've played Tropico 4, Sim City 4, Sim City Societies, Towns, the Stronghold series, and several other RTS's, and I enjoy them all for different reasons. This game doesn't have the economic and public policy complexity of Tropico or Sim City, but what you get instead is a constant sense of battling the elements and keeping your people alive. The primitive setting, with fishing, wood cutting, farming, mining, and a cycle of birth and death, along with weather conditions and seasons give Banished a visceral, earthy vibe that no other game has. It's pretty amazing for what it is, although without some new systems or gameplay elements, I don't know if I'll be able to get 100 hours out of it without it going stale. However, I suspect 40-60 hours should be easily doable, and for a $20 game, that's a great deal.",

I've thought about getting SimCity since it first released but that lost its luster after the first month of issues they had PLUS they didn't offer it on Steam! The price is the game is spot on if not a little less then I would have thought.   The gameplay itself is really a lot of fun. I see a lot of posts about people getting up to 200+ citizens and being able to hold it after 10-15 hours into the game. This I have yet to accomplish. I am up to 60 citizens but unforunately just made a huge mistake of not watching my food storage. It was over 6000 forever and I just forgot to keep checking it. Then all of a sudden after a baby boom, I am out of food and trying to save my entire town from dying off.  The controls are nice as soon as you get used to keyboard shortcuts. Rotating buildings are important as well as building roads. Basic run of thumb is use roads for everything, it will make citizens travel much faster.   It also took me a while to figure out Markets, what I tried to do was to have 2 small towns connected via a road with my forresters in the middle. For the most part this worked out as long as I made sure that I had equal things on both sides to minimize the traffic between both areas.   The only part that is really difficult to keep up is mining for Iron. It takes a lot of people and I am consistently finding myself trying to figure out how to get more.   Overall, it's a great game.

This game is really amazing, and the only complaints i have is the limit of food types, there being only 16 i think, and a limit of professions.

Quite a while ago I discovered this game through GenerikB's spotlight. The game seemed so different from other city builders. Instead of visibly being able to see the balance of needs, you have to watch what happens to the town and figure it out from there. People are dying, they have low health, they are cold. Whatever the issue is, instead of simply looking at a graph - you have to check each of the steps. Is there enough leather? Enough variety of food? Are the deaths random or do they have a cause? Enough producers? Enough manufacturers? This game is about fighting to stay alive and creating the simple basics it takes to create a township. Banished's gameplay is balanced and user-friendly. At the very beginning there is a learning curve and the very first town is likely to die due to some oversite. However with time, frinding that balance becomes easier. This is where I have a few problems with the game. The game itself is wonderful, but what keeps the gameplay going is the mods. Making modding very simple has added many more hours of gameplay to it. These mods make up for what the base game lacks. The base game is very limited, there are only so many different types of buildings and once you've mastered the ins and outs of the game, Finding the proper balance becomes too easy, and expanding into a large town becomes dull. The character pathing needs to be improved, as that shouldn't have to be modded. Adding more variety and complexity to the games, and what keeps coming to mind is the Colonial Charter mod. It adds the opportunity to treade and create new items that would let the small town get more moddern items and luxeries. Each item has it's own purpose, and the step to create the final product requires time, space, and massive rescources. These final products end up in small numbers and sell for a high price, allowing the town to buy more expensive items that it's lacking. The base game lacks the 'end game' entirely. All the fun is during the initial struggle to survive the first few winters- it needs more variety and substance for after the town becomes established.  For anyone who is considering buying the game, if you like rescource management games this is the game for you. It's well worth the money, and it will be a long time before you fully understand the working of the entire game. My complaints are coming from the point of someone who's put in 98 hours of their life into this game (and absolutely will continue to put more hours in) . All of my issues and problems arose once I became very expirenced with the game. If you end up loving the game as much as I do, adding mods won't be a problem. There is only a moddest number of mods out there, but each one seems to address individual problems. Some revamp the entire game, like the ones previosuly mentioned, and there are many small mods that change bits and peices that create the game to your personal taste.  Be prepaired for brutal beginnings, there will be death.",

It has taken the quite bloated survival genre and managed to blend it with city-building to create an experience that is not only original, but addictingly fun to play as well. One thing Banished does very well is immerse you in your village and create an emmotinal attatchment to your town. You feel a sense of loss when a town that you have been playing for several hours finally succumbs to disease, or hunger, or lack of resources, or accepting in too many of those damn gypsies roaming the countryside!   Many players familiar with the Tropico series will know what I mean when I say that many city-builders suffer from loosing their difficulty as time progresses and your town becomes larger and more prosperous. What really sets Banished appart from other city-building games is that the difficulty scales over-time, but it does so in a way feels organic and natural to the game. For the few years or so (aprox 30 minutes of real-life time) or so your village might be constant under threat of hunger and freezing to death in the Winter. Once you manage to get that under control you realize you now need more workers, so you focus on building houses. Then you realize that your immidiate vicinity is running out of resources and you need to start the investment in a mine and quarry. Then you realize you are out of workers. So you accept more of the country-side roaming gypzies in. Then you realize you need food so you start farming. But then you realize you don't have seeds. Your village starts to die, but miracuously a trader comes by with seeds. You snatch them up and your village begins to come back to life. Then everyone gets smallpox and the house of cards comes out from under you.",

Nonetheless, a light difficulty and disaster toggle might allow the more casual experience to have some fun. Development expects to implement modding later, but at the moment, the game is still working out some late-development bugs and compatibility issues. Read the latest news to know if you're able to run it on your machine.  The game's technical approach is considerably difficult to learn, but the advanced techniques it allows means you and try to establish your own goals, or you can quickly adapt after a sudden disaster.  Disappointed with the mess that was 'that other city-building game that had umpteen bajillion problems'?

I downloaded it and began playing immediately, and at first it seemed absolutely fantastic! I couldn't believe how well done everything was. The graphics are great, the maps enormous, the interface, music, and gameplay are all fantastic. However, as I continued to play, I found that there were still a lot of wrinkles to be ironed out, should the developer decide to take the time to do so. The most glaring problem, by far, is the food-shortage issue. As soon as your adult population breaks the 25 - 30 mark, you will inevitably find that if you don't have EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM producing food, you will wind up with an unmanageable food-shortage. Very soon, your people will begin to starve and die at an alarming rate. Either that, or you'll do what I do and transfer almost three-quarters of your workers over to food-production. Which of course leads to massive shortages on other essential resources, like wood for your fires, iron to make tools with, etc... Now I believe that the solution to this is supposed to be to educate your children so that they are more productive when they reach maturity, but if you do this then they will not be able to work until they are 20 or so - rather than going to work at age 10, if they are uneducated - which leaves you with another kind of shortage; a shortage on workers. It's all extremely frustrating because there seems to be no way to balance the equasion, so you are pretty much doomed to failure. This is just my experience of the game. I think that if these issues were ironed out, it would be all-around awesome.",

I still wish there was a little more content, but for the price it is still worth it. The graphics are not the greatest, but is still good enough for the price. The AI can sometimes do things that frustrate the gamer, such as inefficent use of time. For example, the villager needs to build something, but instead of getting supplies(tree logs) accross the street at the supply stash, they go out into the wilderness, cut down trees, take it back to the supply stash, drop off, then go back and pick it up again. Doesn't make sense. It doesn't happen every time, so I don't know if it is a glitch or what. Most of the time the villagers do what they are supposed to.

A bottom up simulation sets the foundation for this game while a harsh unforgiving environment supplies the challenge. Barns store your resources, markets collect resources from around the city for citizens, and people gather food and supplies from the markets into their homes. People need to eat, idle, and stock their homes with perishables in addition to working. Resource management is crucial and a schedule for building is essential to surviving the first few seasons. Every resource you fail to produce for any reason can kill a substatial portion of your population. Inefficient resource gathering placement can cause you to squander land for resource sinks that could otherwise be used for utility. My only complaint is that the game seems to get easier the larger your city becomes. Once you're over a hundred people you have the man power to ensure a constant supply of every resource. Losing 20-30 people will likely resolve your resource problem and you'll only have to make minor adjustments to your job assignments. The fun is definitely in the early game.",

When some of the only complaints you can level against a game are that the 'trader arrives' sound is the same as the 'fire in the city' sound, causing a few seconds of panic, it simply underscores how good the core game is. The openended nature of the game means sometimes your city building will stall with no end game goals to reach, but the desire to spread to new satellit communities, and the dire consequences that can make a once bustling city into a ghost-town if you expand too quickly, make for city playthroughs to consistantly be enjoyable.

            "review_text": "'Banished' is the purest city-building game on the market. There is no external enemy to vanquish, no quests to fulfill, and no help with resources along the way (a la Tropico). Players must turn a group of banished settlers into a town using the resources at hand and proper balancing of roles.  As far as that goes, the game hits the mark. The first few years of any map are tense as the possibility of failure looms overhead. As your city grows, you are faced with new challenges or setbacks, either because of random events (infestations, tornadoes, etc.) or resource depletion (out of stone, out of available workers). If you're a fan of the genre, you should check this game out.  This isn't to say that there aren't deep-seated flaws with the game. Even on the highest difficulties, the game is quite easy after a certain point. Some forward thought eliminates most challenges. Build a trading post early and you can set aside some food and firewood in the early years of abundance to help out in lean seasons. Keeping up with firewood demands by building stone houses after your first few frees up leather from hunting lodges to be turned into coats, which then can be sold to traders, thus providing a passive source of income. Once you're over the hump of the reasonable learning curve, your town becomes unstoppable. You learn, for example, that building a church, hospital, herbalist, or tavern is pointless. Food variety and a graveyard will keep health and happiness both at 4.5, so save your resources.  Lastly, this is an indie game, built by one (very talented) person. While certainly impressive, it means that you can only expect so much. The endgame is nonexistent. At a certain point you're growing your town for the sake of growing your town. But if it's self-sufficient and pratically runs itself, why bother? If you're not aiming towards something, why upset the balance? Suggestion to the creator: *force* the town to grow (e.g. make happiness plummet if adults don't get their own house and/or don't give the player the choice to refuse nomads).  In sum, you have to expect your mileage with this game to be limited. Don't buy it on the promise of what is to come. It may not be reasonable to expect one person to be able to fix everything. It's not clear that modding can turn this game from good to exceptional--that's usually the opposite of what happens. As it stands, $20 seems a bit steep, but $10 seems perfect.",

Obviously a game like this follows in the footsteps of other games like Anno, that are also city building games.   The game comes packaged in a very small download and at an affordable price, and with the huge mod content available, the game really does manage to live up to other games in the genre... To an extent.   Banished isn't nearly as complicated as a games like Anno are, but it also has a different focus that is quite brillient. Namely survival. Your settlers will die in this game, if you do not keep them alive. There are no other threats though, just the risk of starving, freezing or burning to death, work accidents, natural dissasters and illness.   The game is rather simple but difficult at first, and finding out how to balance things out is the tricky part.   Other reviewers have mentined lack of consistency in the game. I have to agree with them. Sometimes a fishermans hut will provide 500 fish per season, with only two uneducated fishermen working there, and at other times a fully stocked with educated fishermen will only provide 100 fish per season. It's not that this is unrealistic, it's just that the game offers no explanation on why this is.   Once you master the few tricks to building a city in this game, it becomes frustratingly easy to play, and at some point your only enemy becomes that wood and stone moves further and further out of your reach, but at this time, you will have reached a point in the game where it doesn't matter.   The game makes a strange leap, shortly after starting. At first, the game is about survival, but then suddenly, you're building churches and town-halls. There is a middle part missing there. A middle part where you build bakeries, butcher-shops, windmills and more. The mods go a long way to remedy this, but I'm not reviewing the mods here.   All in all, it's a game with a lot of good ideas that will definitely challenge my view of games of this genre in the future if they fail to implement the great ideas of this game. Sadly it failed to take with it good ideas from previous and older games, and for that reason I find it rather lacking.   Still, for it's price, it's a very nice game with a really good modding community. Anything the game is missing now is slowly being produced by modders.",

It's pretty easy to get the hang of and the tutorials are good (slightly boring, but most tutorials are and they do give a decent explanation of the game) The buildings look great, but would like to see more in future updates. :) The maps are pretty sweet, plenty of room, but not really a lot going on- generally a lot of forests and rivers with the odd annoying hill/mountain in the way and you only get two choices, valley, or mountainous.   Edit- Having played this game more since i wrote this review (mostly since MOD support has been released, as i did get bored of it when i built everything in a very successful town) i would just like to add a few things. MOD support is now (mostly) up and running though there are still some issues, which i am sure will be sorted soon. And though there aren't a considerable amount of MODs (yet) the few which have been released are brilliant! And have really renewed my interest in the game, as i now have several more buildings i can build plus more animals, crops and things and this is just the beginining. I can't wait for more. :)  Though the one thing that bugs me is that each time you download a new MOD you have to start a new game as it cannot add that new MOD into an existing game, as it crashes.

Is a game where you play at your own pace, marking your own objectives or trying to get the achivments of the game.  Graphically the game looks good, the sound and music accomplish their work.

Managing an entire community is a daunting prospect at first but the learning curve of banished isn't steep.Now granted you will make mistakes that will cause your entire village to starve,freeze, burn to death etc etc.But each time you do you will learn and get better at managing your people and resources.  Banished has a charm that draws you into the world and makes you want to spend hours trying to survive just a few more winters.  Though banished does not boast any combat or invading hordes of barbarians the game does not suffer because of it.It is a fun and enjoyable experience that will make you feel warm inside when your long term planning prevents a food or clothing shortage from devastating your village.

Well, the wait was finally over, and I was almost tempted to let it slip by. Then, recalling my past enthusiasm over the title, I decided that $20 was worth the risk and clicked 'add to cart.' That was one of the best buys I have ever made on Steam.   I cannot get enough of this game. I admit that due to a hectic work week, I have not been able to invest as much time as I would like into the game. Still, from the moment I completed the outstandingly crafted tutorial, I knew this was a favorite. It brings back all the fond memories I cherish of the glory days of Stronghold. It truly captures everything I love about this genre. If you are on the fence, allow me to kindly push you off. Buy this and don't look back. It is deceptively complex, and you will quickly discover that violence is not necessary to create a tense, pins-and-needles game of survival. Granted, you will experince most of what the game has to offer within the first 10-20 hours of play, but don't let that deter you.

You're not getting a broad game with whiz-bang graphics. You're not going to get something that's going to get your pulse going. You're not getting something that's going to give you the feeling of dominating the world.  You're getting a software toy in one of the purest senses of the word. You're getting a suble, refined and elegant experience that allows you to build a simple medieval village. And once you've done so, you sit back and take pride in your handiwork in crafting that village. That's it. That's the entire point of the game. It does this marvelously.   There's no invading goblin forces. There's no magic. No gold to give to the king, no Robin Hood, no mysterious cave to explore. There''s no foozle to kill. There's a lot of things Banished is not. It is a narrowly tailored game about staying alive and sheparding your village towards being a vibrant and sustaining place to live. Your principle opposition is the environment itself, creating a balanced ecosystem and trying to maintain that balance as simple factors like weather, village width, population aging and a bad havest try to throw it out of balance. It's both simple and complex at the same time.  The game is complete and the developer is done with it. From my standpoint he crafted a thing of beauty. Personally, Banished is one of those games I revisit from time to time and I always have a great, relaxing experience doing so. It's like putting on your favorite sweatshirt. It fits well and it feels great.  Now for those who want more, there are Workshop Mods including the comprehensive Colonial Charter mod that add so many different options to the game. So if you like buildilng games with an attention to detail then Banished is for you. It remains one of my favorites in my ever-growing Steam library.

In the early years, you'll get attached to these people, and you might struggle to survive. Or you might prosper, only to have a fire or a hurricane rip out the heart of your settlement and leave you in deep trouble.

            "review_text": "This game is so much fun, a real indepth way to play this city builder/management type game.  It has a bit of a steep learning curve which can be off putting to new players to this type of game but it is highly rewarding when you understand how to play.  Basic Overview -  It is your job to make sure your colonists (towns people) don't die. Simple. You build building with certain purposes and have to assign your people to work there, otherwise its an empty useless building. Now how do you keep your colonists alive, well you have to do a number of things. Keep them warm Keep them fed Keep them happy Keep them healthy  Now to do all this you need to create houses for your people to live in, create buildings to gather food which you then must assign a number of your colonists to do which takes away from your general workforce. While doing this you need to set up material gatherers, such as wood cutter, stone cutters and iron miners. All need there own buildings and you need to set colonists to work there. Now we run into the problem that you need more colonists for all these jobs, but having more colonists means more food needed. So we build more houses and hope more colonists are 'created' and the young ones born can actually reach maturity without dying of cold or starving. Now we have some more colonists and all the jobs are filled, yay!  BUT WAIT  Your tools are running low, idiot you forgot to build a blacksmith to create tools! Your poor people are carving rocks with their hands, this aint minecraft! So your production of EVERYTHING slows down about 80%. Now you start to panic because your food is starting to deplete at an alarming rate. You quickly build a blacksmith and just in time to start producing tools. phew!  Now you decide your little town is able to sustain it's self and you think 'maybe i should expand, but what should I do' Well, you can choose so many different paths. You could build a trader on the water and try and get some new things such as farm animals or seeds for your very own farms. Lets say we build the trader and they arrive and they have cows for sale. Now there isn't money in this game, you need to fork over your hard earned resources for these cows and ofcourse you need 2 of them otherwise they wont reproduce. So you hand over ALL your precious stone which has killed many of your people to gather in hopes for these cows.  Whoop, you have cows now. But they need a pasture. So you build one and it's big, bigger than you expected. You assign some people to tend to these lovely cows. Almost straight away they start producing milk, this was a good trade. Now you've had these cows a while, 2 cows has turned into 10 cows but your pasture isn't big enough for any more so any excess cows start to be slaughters for there meat and leather. Your people get to eat meat and now you have some strange leather. You build a tanner/tailor to craft these pieces of leather to create clothes to make sure your people dont freeze. Also you have left over clothes and you trade them with the merchant for another type of animal, maybe sheep for mutton and wool or maybe some chickens, you can have so many eggs.  Anyway i've been rambling and unfortunatly a disease has now popped up and you being silly forgot to build a doctor and it wipes out half your population in a matter of minutes. This hit was hard, you can sustain your new population with it's high demands and they slowly starve to death.  They're all dead now...  What would you do differently next time, maybe cows weren't a good trade? Have fun!  10/10 - Would do it again   The vanilla version of the game is perfect as it is as it gives you enough variety and space to explore good combinations of how to use the ingame economy. On the other hand, I couldn't play this game without the MODS. I have played it enough to enjoy it and after a while it becomes a little boring because they're isn't enough. But the MODS, mainly the one created by BlackLiquid, add SOOOO much to the game! they add so many new things to influence the economy and make your expierence just so much more fun and difficult.  I have been playing this game since it came out and I still return to it today, it's fun and always able to provide a good challange,",

Easy to learn and I'd say hard to master but everything I've read points to an existing meta that will generally lead your town to lasting success. Luckily, there's already some great mods which add an impressive amount of new layers to the core gameplay. Did I mention hypothermia? That's a bad one too, it'll get you if you're greedy (like me) and put aside too much firewood to trade and don't leave enough for the townsfolk to keep themselves warm. I try to justify mass negligent manslaughter by telling myself these people were probably Banished for good reasons; dog-haters, theater talkers, or vaping enthusiasts.

Then, after reading various posts in the forums here, I began to have a realization of the mechanics of the game. Understanding of the How's and Why's of the way the game works. Before long I had purchased 3 Banishes and installed them on all three of my computers in my home. My wife plays on her Vaio Laptop and my brother in law and I play on separate desktops. We have very few problems with the game and if we do it is usually our fault due to a decision we made with gameplay. I have over 300 Citizens in my town of Sandusky and my wife, sad to say, has over 400 in her town of Richville. (This fact she constantly derides me with) My brother in law is still struggling with a population of 95. Keep in mind that even on Easy it is not an easy game to conquer but it is very challanging and enjoyable and well worth the dollars paid for it. I recommend this game very highly to the City Builders who are interested.",

For example you will get to a point where almost all of your people die and you realize you made a mistake... 3 hours ago! It really is a Zen like experience, where you get emotionally attached to your beautiful village and than watch all your people die from hunger, cold or even a tornado. And you immediately start again. If that is something that sounds fun to you, I would recommend you buy this game even for the full price, it really is worth it. However if you don't suffer from a mild case of OCD and actually like games that are more fun than frustrating, I would rather recommend any game from the Tropico series. Banished is actually pretty similar to Tropico.  As I mentioned, the game has some problems. - On some HW it runs on the integrated GPU instead of the dedicated GPU - Some elements of building are not visible enough. Specially building in forests and around hills - One house not having enough food can result in hundreds of people dyeing - No way to find buildings that have been plotted down and not built yet - Traders keep bringing you seeds for plants you already have - The game can be very repetitive and there is not much to do once you build a large town - No modding support (or at least not Steam Workshop)  All in all this is a great game but only for certain people. I will look forward to any updates, DLCs or mods. I even bought it for my girlfriend and she also enjoyed it very much.  4/5",

When I first purchased Banished it looked like a nice game that I could play and not really pay much attention to it while I'm doing other things on the internet and for the first hour or so it was that way on Medium difficulty but not for much longer. After hitting a population of 30 I quickly started depleting my food supplies and my entire town died. That was the point at which I realised that this is not just a simulation game, it's a strategy game that is extremely rewarding when you take the time to plan out your town and penalizes you severely for lack of forethought and expanding more quickly than your economy can handle. Slow and steady with apropriate infrastructure expansion is the only way to expand without your town imploding upon itself.   Banished is a very accessible game to start playing but is by no means shallow in its mechanics. Easy to grasp, difficult to master is the name of the game and that's refreshing in a game nowadays. Banished could be faulted for its lack of in depth explanations of each building's mechanics but discovering them for yourself is half the fun.  The tutorials give you a strong enough grasp of the game to get started but to be honest I didn't even do them until I wrote this review for the sake of completeness.   Pros:  The game looks good.  Easy to play but difficult to master (Can be a con if you're looking for a super casual game) Cheap (The 20 dollar price tag is well worth it for this game.) Coded by 1 person start to finish. (If nothing else it's just impressive.)  Cons: Visibility could use some work. It's difficult to spot problem areas in your town if you don't know what to look for. UI needs a few usability tweaks. Villager AI can be unpredictable at times.  Overall: 8/10 Great game",

It is more in building stuff than ordering them around, like building a fishery to produce food, building a lumbermill to get wood for your woodcutter to produce firework for your houses for winter, and building a hospital to combat diseases. Basically you build stuff then watch them construct and operate the buildings. You watch as your little group grows to a 100 and more as years pass affecting your whole colony in their survival. The game also offers: managing the jobs and production of your citizens, item production (tools, clothing), trading, winter, and disasters. Like I said, It's different from other City builders since it has survival elements which if you fail to satisfy, its game over from starvation, hypothermia, disasters, and diseases.   PROS: - Smart AI - Great macromanagement (you are mostly laid back as your town grows) - Simple and easy to understand - Great season transitions with varying effects - Challenging with a high possibility of losing if you mess up - Various building choices (blacksmith, tailor, orchard, crops, mine, quarry, etc.) - Mods - Little to no bugs and glitches  CONS: - Missing management tools (food/resource consumption control, multi/combined jobs, population control) - No endgame stuff: mega buildings and decorations (the endgame is basically you filling the entire map with your town and surviving for years)  CONCLUSION Highly recommended to buy if you're into City building/Management games with a challenge much like dwarf fortress.

It's a resource management town builder, and we've all played these games before such as Towns or Gnomoria but this games feels different. One of the differences is graphics, there much better here in banished mind you if you've notice some of my games i don't really care about graphics as long as the game is enjoyable. The game play differs somewhat from let’s say towns in that micro management isn’t as in depth (a little let down providing that I’m a slight control freak). In Towns you can manage a whole supply chain for example wheat to flour to bread, in banished you can manage thing like food production but lets say you have a brewery that requires wheat if you've reached food production then no more wheat will be cut (even if you don't have any) and so no more alcohol. But small things aside this game you just feel more responsible to your community and so waste hours on end trying to maintain your village though famine, epidemics, and tornadoes. And when all go’s to hell the anguish of watching your village fall to pieces is just s_hit. I highly recommend this game to all those who enjoy Management type games i assure you you wont regret. 8/10  P.S. I did buy this in the steam Xmas sales so I spent 4.99 USD",

            "review_text": "Banished is a fantastically atmospheric, albeit barebones, city builder set in pseudo-colonial times. You start off with a handful of ragged outcasts thrust into the wilderness with a mission of building your own civilization from the landscape. Because of its small scope, Banished is also much more personable than more robust city builders; instead of managing multiple cities or even a nation, you start with four to six families and grow to a few hundred people (or more, depending on how long you wish to play a map). This isolation combined with little charming touches, like knowing each citizen's personal info, excellent ambient sound design, and a slower paced game speed, makes Banished the most atmospheric fictional city builder I have played.  Although there is a rough 'progression' to what you can build via resource requirements, any building can be built at any time depending on what your city needs. Real strategy comes in properly timing and planning your construction; While Banished is a pretty laid-back game, a sudden influx of nomads can bring diseases or cause starvation if your city isn't prepared and construction takes significant manpower and cross-profession coordination. This flexibility can be overwhelming for a new player trying to survive their first winter but thankfully Banished's tutorials are well constructed and actually worth playing through even for veterans. Your city's growth (and essentially the game's difficulty) is tied to how much or how little you want to build, leading to a more relaxed game than most city builders.  Even though I loved most of this game, I spent a lot of time fighting with the villager's AI. While Banished strictly doesn't have win/lose conditions, it is heart-breaking to watch your citizens die from starvation while they are harvesting crops or gathering fish. Other AI issues emerge much earlier in the game, like farmers acting like laborers and not tending their fields during the summer. Laborers also seem to act erratically; when you assign multiple removal tasks, they seem to work in arbitary priority. Constructing multiple buildings is a huge pain with trying to coordinate the laborers with the builders; I eventually resorted to laying down a 'building plan' and mass-pausing construction, unpausing one building at a time to be built. Maybe I don't understand all the intracies of the AI but 50 hours in and I'm still frustrated and often resorting to using the 'Increase Priority' tool.   Banished is also missing many things that add challenge and depth to other city builders. This is essentially the 'kiddie pool' of city builders with no crime, polution, budget balancing/taxation, or non-essential buildings. With 31 construction options, everything you build is for managing food, housing or supplying citizens, or transportation needs. There are some minor trading elements but its mostly there to keep your city growing once you run out of certain resources. Once you have a stable city running all there is to do is make it bigger while avoiding starvation or disasters. The same could be said of many games but I always look forward to building a sports stadium in SimCity... here it feels like it's just food, food, and more food.   If you haven't played a city builder before, Banished is a great place to start. Veterans looking for a more laid-back experience will get a few dozen hours out of this while alt+tabbed with something else. Nothing here is groundbreaking but what there is is a great change of pace from playing certain other sims at Cheetah speed.",

I liked it then, but it wasn't completed, in my opinion. The game lacked content and the games became repetitive, tedious, and boring.   --Enter mods --  The developer opened the game to modding and breathed life into this game. Don't get me wrong, the game could have been fantastic all by itself if the developer had added some much needed content and story, but the community mods fixed all that.   You can add mods right from the game menu now; you can get extra buildings, items, etc. You can d/l mods that add story to the game (albeit linear). But the mods fixed this game and now I'm going to give this game a definite thumbs up and a definite recommend -- before I would have said wait it out.   The graphics are good enough. The RTS is great (much better with mods). The ability to fail was, however, greatly diminished with the mods (the only downside to certain mods).   If you like casual RTS games, miss Sim City, and want to plan out a city, but hate Ubisoft (Anno), get this. You'll not be sorry you did.",

The reason of 6 is because one man did everything, the game is visually appealing, and it is addictive even though the game punishes the player harshly for the slightest mistakes.  Now the reason for the lower score than most give is because the mechanics and math don't add up. This game is more about producing mass amounts of food and firewood, beyond what your villagers need. The villagers hoard greats amount of food, most of this lays on the kids that do nothing but idle around town and repeatedly gather food/firewood for their homes. This would not be an issue if it did infact aide the family, but atlas it does not. Because the parents will still stop the production of their job to go gather food/firewood for their homes. Kids are more annoying than Sims 3 newborns to me.  The villagers even educated will switch jobs way too much which can cause issues with the economy of your village. Educated people as far as I see are no better than uneducated. I've seen both idle, produce less, and randomly do stupid things.   The hospital is just used for diseases, which makes it a rather dull building wasting a single villager, and in fact I've seen that the doctor isn't that great no matter if educated or not. They simply don't cure like they should to waste that much stone, wood, iron, and man power on it. The herbalist is a better doctor, but they don't cure diseases from what I can tell.   Once you hit a large settement, your villagers seem even more stupid and do some crazy things that cause them to die, starve, or what have you.   Disasters. Well they do come randomly but your villagers are beyond stupid and don't do anything about them. Tornado will strike and they are like OH look! Pretty!..then die. Your town catches on fire and it seems like the villager's don't care. No matter how many labors you have they will walk right past the well and not try to put out the fire. But they will soon have issues over deaths and other stuff that the disaster destroyed. Idiots..the whole lot of them.   There is more I could post, I did the math of the mechanics of the game. It took me quite a few hours to achieve the information, wanting to adore this game. But when it came right down to it, the mechanics and math do not work good together. There are some tweaks needed to adjust the balance of the game.  Now if you don't mind mainly providing a mass amount of food and firewood for stupid villagers this game will be great for you. But if you are like me and think some logic should be applied, the mechanics of the game should be somewhat close to the numbers..then I would suggest you wait. There is no combat.  There is suppose to be a modkit coming. This could greatly aide the game. I play it now because Gnomoria is kinda broken right now, Age of Wonders 3 and Elder Scrolls Online isn't due out yet. Once these games are up or fixed. This game will likely fall into the forgotten games of my library. But I will watch for updates and the suppose modkit release.",

Once you've learned the extent of the stupidty of the AI and how to build to compensate for it, the game isn't much more than a food production and distribution simulator. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, depending on what you're looking for. It's the game's simplicity that allows you to tinker without worrying about your entire town collapsing because you took your eyes off the ball for half an hour as you looked around the map for where you wanted to build next and how you wanted to do it.   Unfortunately, the simplcity also extends to production and building types, both being severely limited. Easy enough to fix with mods, though. Unfortunately, what is not fixable with mods is the AI.  Is it worth $20? Depends on what your expectations are. If you want a fun, simple city builder that has no real point beyond the aesthetic, it's well worth it. If you want a game that appears just complex enough to let you feel like a pro and haunt the game's forums, regurgitating basically the same thing that's been said half a dozen times already in the same thread then this is the game for you.  But if you want a game with complex, intuitive AI and the ability to control more than just where stuff gets built and how many people work there you may want to wait for a sale.",

            "review_text": "Banished Review-  Banished is an overall impressive game that looks stunning, has very entertaining gameplay and good music. Made by just one person, it impresses me even now.  Technical stuff- I will get all the technical stuff out of the way first.  The game looks extremely pretty and tranquil without much effort. The texture quality is not brilliant but the way the models are put together makes them look absolutely stunning. The reflections are seriously good looking and the shadows really do bring the entire scene together.  Banished can run on just about everything at a decent framerate. On my old very low-end PC (struggled to run practically anything on low) I could pull off about medium, 1080p and 40fps. When I got my rig, I maxed it all with about 300-400fps. However, very large towns (population 1,500+) will lag on practically anything, as the engine cannot handle all of the different AI at once. Also the game is only about 200mb, so it is a very fast download.  Gameplay- The gameplay is excellent.   You start with about 20 people in the middle of nowhere (with three difficulty options, affecting what resources you get and what structures are prebuilt) and have to build a town to support this exiled group of people. The tutorials will give you enough advice to get your foot in the door and allow you to get started, but a lot is left for you to discover, through trial and error and many, many deaths.  Every single individual has their own AI, telling them if they have to work, if they have to eat, if they have to warm up. You can assign jobs such as vendor, fisherman or teacher (besides many others) and the citizen will do that, between eating and staying warm.   Although the game looks very tranquil and calm it is extremely punishing. Many of your towns will succumb to illness, or famine or other forms or death in massive numbers, that will leave you knowing not to make a town like that again. There are disasters that will burn or blow you people away in the form of a tornado, or kill everyone with flu, or kill all their crops with insects. Thankfully, they are not all too common, can be prevented with wells or hospitals, or can be switched off altogether; but what is the fun in that?  After many, many hours you will have a formula for making a town which will survive whatever the elements can throw at it and then you will start to get bored. But never fear, for the modding community is alive and active for this game. Mods such as Colonial charter will completely change the game and add hundreds of hours of new content. Many, many mods can be found across the internet only needing to be extracted, placed in the game folders, and activating them through an in-game menu. Also, Banished has Steam Workshop support; so many mods can be installed with the click of a button.  One final point is, after a making a few different towns it can get quite repetitive at points but most of the time it is very fun to play.  Music- The music in Banished is excellent but does get repetitive as there are only 15 tracks, just play your own music over the game if you want something to listen to.  The music is very calm and tranquil and suits the entire feel of the game.  Overall-  Pros- • Brilliant graphics and performance • Challenging, but fun gameplay • Excellent modding capabilities • Very nice soundtrack • Very rewarding gameplay  Cons- • Lack of content means it can get boring after a few 100 hours (although modding can fix that) • Repetitive gameplay at points",

One thing that can feel strange in this game is that you don't see 'gold' or 'coins' or any type of 'money' management in this game. You just gather resources and food and build while the population evolves.  I recommend this game if you like Settlers, Sim City, ...

            "review_text": "Don't be put off by how many hours I've put into Banished so far, my review will simply be covering what I have experienced so far and my current judgment of the game.  If you're looking for a very accomplishing, difficult, village-builder, Banished is the game for you. I'm personally a fan of strategic city-building games, such as SimCity and Anno, but I believe the confusion when people first look at Banished is that it's like other city-building games. Well, it's not at all.  Sure, Banished has a lot of familiar aspects. Overall, you must realize that the setting of Banished is that you have a handful of villagers that have been banished -- you are alone in this part of the world and will never see anyone else. Banished is a game that revolves completely around your village and village alone, I use the word village quite often because you will not have a city in Banished. There aren't any structures, unless you use mods, that could really qualify as a city, and you'd have to be pretty lucky to actually achieve the size of a city in this game. Starvation and natural disasters WILL end you.  Perhaps the way this game functions is appealing to some, but to me the game becomes repetitive and can become very boring at times. The only reason, I believe, that people have so many hours on Banished, is because the game is very slow. You can actually increase the speed/rate at which the village develops, but at best you want to 2x the speed and micro-manage properly or else things will go terribly wrong. So far this is my fifth time starting the game, the other four times my villages died from starvation or the winters were too cold. Banished is definitely a challenge and will be fun the first time you 'beat' the game.  If I had helped develop Banished, I would have created a more lively feeling in the world that it generates. I believe that Banished is lacking a very social feel, there should have been other villages/cities you could interact with. Perhaps there could have been more conflict than just building a successful village by placing the right buildings at the right time and in the right order. Banished also could have been very satisfying with a multiplayer option, be it servers, LAN, what ever.  Do I suggest Banished? Yes. I bought the game when it was on sale and I believe that will be the only time that Banished would be worth the money. You will pour many hours into the game, become frustrated, perhaps quit a few times, but you will be satisfied and overall I believe that if you enjoy construction and strategy, Banished is perfect for you.",

During a particularly stressful time in my life this little gem popped up in the steam summer sale and has received most of my attention since.  In this game, you play an omnipotent and omnipresent overlord of a small and yearning-to-thrive midevil hamlet. Starting with a handful of people and a place to store goods, this simcity-like simulator encourages you to build your little hamlet from nothing into a bustling town. In the process, you need to manage your people's heath, happiness, hunger and warmth.   Banished is a very calming exercise. You have no invading hordes to worry about, no political alliances to manage and no trade routes to maintain. This is city management at its purest form. Like SimCity, you may have some disasters.. a sickness here, loss of crops there.. but these 'disasters' are few and far between and often easily managed. (Though, admitted, I did have one early game in which a tornado decided to just roll right through my town killing all but 6 of my people.)   The goal here is to build. With building comes additional management. Placement becomes key. Pathing becomes a puzzle. Your little dominion grows into a bustling small town. Your blacksmiths tink tink tink the days away. The chatter of your folk is omnipresent. The harridness of the small town grows into a bustling small city.  This is your world. You created it.  Cathartic.

And honestly, the castle building was one of the most fun parts of Stronghold, so Banished already had that going for it. Banished is a humble game; it knows what it does well, and it does just that, and not much more. I can definitely appreciate that. It isn't about killing, or destruction, or anything violent. You start with a small band of villagers, and work to scrape out a meager living on the barren rock. Over time, the village develops and grows, and becomes more prosperous... or not. It all depends on the decisions you make.  My one big critique is that the achievements are disabled by mods. Since I largely play a game until I unlock all the achievements, then don't play it much more, I was disappointed that I couldn't try out some of the mods that make the game a bit easier (and more fun). I understand why the developer chose to disable achievements with mods active, as there are some out there that are pretty powerful, but there are also harmless mods (such as translations) that would be nice for users who don't necessarily speak a language the game is issued in.   Banished is one of the few games I've played in recent history that receives a solid recommendation. I can't think of much I'd change about it, except perhaps make it a hair easier. After all, the point of games is to have fun (and to be challenged, to an extent), but it's hard to have fun if you realise you've been playing the wrong way for the last six hours and need to restart. Also, I'd include a disclaimer in the mods section that says achievements will be disabled if you play with them. That's not an intuitive concept, and it seems like it could be a huge waste of time for someone achievement hunting if they don't realise that mods do, in fact, disable the achievements.",

Maybe an expansion pack would turn things around? Anyway, it's still a fun little game, and at this price, is still worth buying.",

You start out with your basic world options and it tosses you in with some settlers and supplies varrying based on diffiulty, that's the easiest point in the game. The game gets tough as hell as it goes on as you'd expect but in some unexpected ways.  The biggest thing i always had was villagers, never enough but always too many. You have to assign villagers to jobs to get resources and to get more you need homes to encourage some 'spawning' but i'd always hit a point where all my villagers were old and in death beds and for years i'd be stuck without any sort of youth to take over, jobs would start to fall, winter would kill people along side famine. Now on the opposite side i always had an issue with having too many people working so nobody could run off to clear land for me and i'd have to pick what area of the village suffers. Don't get me wrong, i like the challenge, it's not just point and click to win you have to be ready for a generation to fall off the earth.  The biggest issue i have with the game by far though is the AI in general. I'd have a path set up and nobody would use it so traveling would take twice as long, i'd have people assigned to jobs they wouldn't do for a week, projects would lay dormant for years, it's hell.  One thing i love to death about Banished is just how easy it is to get into, sure it's tough as hell eventually but it's so easy to start up and just get a game going. Overall i'd give this game about a 7/10 it's got some issues and the difficulty ramp is pretty steep but it's a great game with some nice workshop stuff.",

Excellent use of zoom based detail. Excellent use of weather elements. Animations are clear, but not overdone. I run this on a really weak onboard graphics chip and it's still going strong.  Gameplay - Again, its so engrossing that you will need to set alarms for yourself to go to bed at night. Everytime you solve one problem, another creeps up. I've gotten a lot better at staying in front of trouble, and staying well stocked, but it's a challenge. Especailly when you get over 1000 citizens. Some things stabilize.  CONS  Graphics - Sometimes the weather layer is so thick that it stops you from getting things done. (Which may actually be the point now that I think about it).   Gameplay - There are some frustrations with the AI. Sometimes people will drop dead of starvation while carrying a box of food to a barn. One one hand, I know these people are really representing the society as a whole, that their sacrafice is a result of low food stores and distribution, and I shouldn't be so bothered by this. But on the other hand, each person in the town is so detailed: Name, gender, age, education, clothing, kids...Heck! You can even use a tool to see the path they use to get to work. I'm surprised that they don't have some piece of AI that says 'forget the greater good! I'm eating this cabbage before I die!' There's just no self-preservation meter.  All in all, totally worth the $10. I've got 50 hours of gameplay in so far, and I'm only writing this review, because I had an outbreak of Cholera, and I just needed to take a break before the possible death spiral.",

However it should be improved in the future (Add-On) because some parts are not realistic. For example in every society there are troublemakers and outlaws and even external threats, however in this game don´t exist any militia or police for control this kind of social and military problems that might arise in every real society. Thus in my opinion despite this is a “pacific” game it need also to have walls for protect the city and some (real and needed) professions like local militia (or soldiers) for keep the peace and order in the city in order to be much more realistic. Despite this flaw buy the game you will not be sorry …",

            "review_text": "At it's heart, Banished is a simple game, but it is not easy. I have found it very difficult, at least at the start of a new game. It feels like, to me, getting everything almost perfect is critical to the survival of your people. Don't think I'm complaining, though! Getting a city to flourish is so incredibly satisfying, all the more so because it doesn't happen every time. There is a real sense of accomplishment watching your city grow.  However, it also means that problems you encounter are very difficult, sometimes impossible, to overcome. This game really teaches you that hindsight is 20/20. I would advise having a few different save files.  City management games can easily become tedious, but Banished has never felt so. There are definite stages. The founding of your city is, as I said above, the more difficult. Once your resources are sufficiently built up, you enter a stabilization phase, building population and expanding your city. The endgame is mostly trading for unrenewable resources, and can get a little monotonous, but it takes a while.  Banished is a truly beautiful game. The graphics are detailed without being overdone. I've never had lag or framerate issues. The soundtrack is similarly engaging, without being distracting.  The controls are a bit odd, but comfortable once you get used to them.   The Workshop is full of useful or fun mods, addressing balancing/peeves or creating new buildings.   All in all, 7.5/10.",

It's constant growth, all over, until you just can't take it anymore, the inefficiencies of your production cycles, however minute they were, are having a compounding effect and before you know it the healthy food production you thought you had plummets like a rock and it's late summer or later. By spring you've lost 10-15% of your population and you no longer have the manpower to work your system. Firewood production breaks down, there's nobody gathering new logs, fishermen are fiddling around but not catching anything - they're freezing to death because the hunters have stopped gathering leathers and your tailor, what tailor? plucky fishermen, the odd gatherer, the priest, they're holding on. You shut down the mines, markets are down to one vendor, throw everyone at food production but it's too late, you're out of firewood and winter is coming. You're doomed.

Choose between resources to produce and buy others from traders or choose to be an isolationist and make everything for yourself. If you choose to be an isolationist, you will be rewarded with an achievement if you manage to survive and build to 300 people. Believe me, the achievements in this game are hard to get. If you somehow manage to get them all you are a true banished master and you have to show something to show off to your friends and to me.   Two major strong points of Banished: Lots of replay ability, new challenges with every random map. The achievements, and the general feeling of satisfaction of a proper running town.  The weakness: The limits you can develop a single town, at a certain point you just have to scale your town up (2 tailors, 2 blacksmiths etc.). The overhead it introduces makes the game harder but you can’t do much about it. Personally I haven’t reached this point yet, but that’s where the relative low review scores come from.

I also realized that after I had gotten to about 100 people in the town, there really wasn't much left to unlock or explore, because I'd built every type of building and explored how to make things run efficiently already.  Then, mod support was added. There are also now a ton of mods, some of which drastically alter the depth and balance of the game, and those are worth a look once the base game gets too stale, though I recommend at least trying to play the vanilla way to start.  Even though I'm pretty bored with Banished now and it seems like it's not going to be updated any further, I still can see myself coming back to take another crack at the game later on, maybe trying some new mods people have created.

What if you were forced out of civilization as you know it, to live in the wilderness? How do you think you'd fare? Banished asks those questions, opening with a dozen or so outcasts seeking to make their way in the wilderness. It's a humble setup, but the game is masterfully constructed with dozens of interlocking mechanics--the perfect foundation for a stinging emergent narrative and a focus on empathy in the face of a Malthusian world.  People, more than anything else, are your vital resource. They need homes, food, decent clothes, tools, emotional support, medicine, and more. Every mechanic, every building you can place, and everything else you can do relates back to that central theme of survival. If you can't gather enough food, your people die. If they're stuck outside for too long, or don't have warm clothing, they die. Each time you fail as their leader, you're reminded of the loss with a grating sound and a yellow gravestone. These serve as a one-two punch to punish you for failure because losing citizens makes it that much harder to keep up the resource flow. One fewer worker means you can't gather food, stone, wood, or anything else as quickly. When children die, it's even worse, though you likely won't know it for some time. As your population ages, you eventually lose more than a few citizens to old age, and the best way to replace them is to give your younger citizens houses in the hopes that they'll reproduce and bolster your future numbers.While the process of survival is never-ending, holding out against the elements amid the hostility of the untamed natural world is a small but powerful personal victory. Villagers have names; they're born, grow up, and eventually die under your intense supervision. Banished reinforces the human drama with its brutal difficulty and negative feedback loops. It's fertile soil for some of the most remarkable emergent storytelling around. With relatively few, well-designed mechanics, the game weaves a powerful tale of empathy and desperation and is a high-water mark for narrative elements that mutually reinforce mechanics. Even better, this is a very human story divorced from the Western tropes common in the loosely imperialistic messages of other, similar games. It's just you, your people, and their strong desire to live.",

The graphics is neat and distinguishes - mainly because of the setting - quite from modern city builders which really gives it a good feel.   There are a few things I would have loved to see improved though.  - more buildings. It's quite interesting that despite all other city builders doing it differently, here all buildings are available from the start. However after some time it gets quite boring as you're basically building the same old all over the place. More variety would have been nice. - resources. After a while, all my mountains were plastered with iron and coal mines. Once a mine has been stripped of coal, you can't just change to iron. If one resource has been stripped, the other resource has been stripped too. The counter basically counts for all resources together. Eventually, you will run out of resources. Keeping the map running is difficult then, because tools need iron, without iron mines you have to rely on the trade boats, eventually with bigger cities, the trade boat with tools won't come often enough. - trade. Sometimes trade just doesn't make sense. I.e. some items could not be traded for certain other items. If that would be random I could understand (as in trader has requests too), but I remember trying each time and it was the same goods I wanted to trade-in that the trader didn't want. Rather odd. - Stone quarries are quite big and once they've run out of stone, nothing can be done with them. So you'll also start plastering big massive holes into your area which then can't be used anymore at all. If at the beginning you put one of those stone quarries into the wrong spot that will block your expansion, then you basically screwed up your hole game.  But these problems are small compared to the fun I had with the game. Certainly something to be recommended. I hope at some stage it will get some expansions or DLCs or something to extend the content a bit. Multiplayer would be great - a feature often requested but rarely implemented. :-)",

The complexity of towns can become overwhelming, and a lot of the achievements are pretty hard to get, even on the easier difficulties. It really immerses you into the world of being Banished. You have to change your crops out every now and again so your villagers can stay healthy and receive varied nutrients from food sources. It doesn't just encourage crop exchanging and looking for more than one type of food, it practically enforces it if you're not playing on the easiest difficulty, otherwise your town won't thrive, it'll just make it by. There are some mods from the workshop that I'd say should be part of the base game, but overall this game, its controls, and how it flows is just marvelous.  Build houses.

I've played 2 towns so far and spent 10 hrs on each, both are still going strong even after fires, famine, lack of tools, and a bout of freezings but I have come close to loosing everything multiple times. Really I just lucked out and had some very well timed visits from merchants that saved me. This game definitely makes you think through your actions and requires almost constant attention, but thats fine because so few games actually require your full attention to suceed these days. While there isn't a way to WIN, the winning is just not loosing, which can be extremely difficult.   While the game doesn't have as many buildings as something like SimiCity, it doesn't really need it to be a good game. Though, it does have amazing potential for expansion in many, many areas such as food production chains, multiplayer, luxeries production, etc. These could be either through mods, which the Dev has stated that he will be adding support for in the future, or expansions, which the Dev has also stated he may do.  While some are having issues with bugs, at 20 hrs I've yet to run into a single bug. The Dev also clearly cares how the game is recieved as evident by the extensive bug testing before release (actually postponing release to do extra testing) and his diligence in clearing up or providing work arounds for those that did sneak past his testers.  I would recommend this game to anybody who enjoys city builders and/or survival games with a warning to prepare for a challenge.  10/10",

But child labour is frowned upon apparentaly, so they don't work, but die of starvation. So you make sure laborours are assigned from one job to another, say, herbalist from farmer. BOOM, yellow fever comes around the corner. No herbs anymore, people die. After something like that, slowly rebuilding what is left of your population is very rewarding.

            "review_text": "This game is simply incredible, considering it was developed by 1 guy. The reviewers complaining about lack of content miss the point - and challenge - of the game, which is to grow your town's population as high as possible, overcoming various obstacles like starvation, freezing, and malnutrition. The bigger your population gets, the more exciting the game becomes, because the threat of extinction is always lurking just around the corner. A single wrong decision, which may appear completely trivial at the time you make it, can spark a chain reaction that kills off your entire town.  You must carefully juggle dozens of factors to strike a balance between population growth and population management. Mass building houses in the early game may seem like a good path to explosive growth, but will inevitably cause mass starvation because you don't have enough food production.   Some of the game's features do seem a bit quirky, as your citizens follow a very strict set of rules. For example, a farmer goes to work on a farm; when he gets hungry he must go home and eat the food he stored there; if there's no food he'll go back to work, and starve while carrying the food he just harvested. While these features may seem nonsensical, they require you to plan your town development down to the last excruciating detail.  The biggest challenge of this game is to avoid making mistakes. As mentioned, a mistake usually won't become apparent until long after it's made. Trading away some of your stockpiled tools, for example, may seem like a good idea since you're not doing anything with them, until years later when your population suddenly expands and you face a tool shortage, which destroys your town's productivity, and naturally, leads to mass starvation.  The game also throws in a number of what I call Venus Flytrap features, ones that look too good to pass up, but are really invitations for disaster. Best example is Nomads, uneducated citizens without tools or cloths who offer to join your town and boost its population growth, which is after all what you want desparately as your natives are dying off from old age and not procreating fast enough. Aside from introducing diseases that may wipe off your town if you don't have enough hospitals ready, nomads will almost always start a butterfly effect that decimates your late game economy. A not-so-subtle, anti-immigrant sentiment from the developer, but oh well, nobody's perfect.   A golden moment of the game was when a 71 year old male Teacher shacks up with a 17 year old student, and when the latter turns 18, gives birth -- priceless. If only I took a screenshot.",

It's a colony simulator, and it makes you think about bare necessities rather than empire building. You start out with some basic supplies, but have to get everything else from your surroundings. It's a very laid-back, relaxing game--until you realize your firewood supply is low and winter is approaching, or you've used all of the available stone and can't build a bridge to the only place you have room for a quarry.   In the simplest terms, this is a management game. You have to balance a large set of priorities, moving people and resources to different functions throughout each year. But if you keep your people fed, clothed, housed, and healthy, you'll build your village into a thriving town, and eventually into a city.   At the low purchase price, this is a must-play for anyone who enjoys simulation games.",

Indeed, I catch myself pondering the most efficient building placements so that my hunters and gatherers don't have to travel too far for too long. I calculate and analyze ideal farm sizes to maximize their food production per farmer. I agonize over the realization that I must build new homes for my young citizens, or face a slow and certain decay through stagnation. I worry about the sustainability of my village. Knowing full well that stone, iron and coal are finite resources that once gone, are gone. Sure, I can plop mines and quarries but I cannot reclaim that terrain once they have been exhausted. Is that sustainable?  Again, it's rare a game that does this to me. Even the all mighty Civilization series rarely has me thinking this deeply about the game when I'm not playing it. The remarkable thing about this game is that despite everything I just said, it seems very uncomplicated at first. And in truth, it is pretty basic. Feed your people, provide them shelter, collect resources, EXPAND!   While that's all true. If you go about this process in a blundering or powergaming fashion, you'll do just fine. Until about your 25th year when you realize you've made a terrible mistake. That you've been repeating that terrible mistake each season. Your village is doomed, and there is little to nothing you can do about it. Assuming you realize your mistake at all.   Usually what happens, is you're suddenly faced with an unexplained catastrophe from a mistake you made as many as 10 seasons ago. This mistake could slowly lead to starvation, or even death by freezing when you run low on firewood and warm coats. You'll focus all your attention on resolving it. Yet, it's not until after your village dies and you walk away from the game that you analyze what went wrong. Thirty minutes later, you're back at the game vowing not to make the same mistake again.  The game features an option to toggle disasters like disease, fire, tornados, even pest infestations. Often, however, the biggest disaster to befall your village is you, the player. Will your banished villagers survive you? Get this game now, and you'll spend hours trying to find out.",

Building houses so the villagers make new ones. But you can't just rush. Because many kids means many mouths to feed without manpower. And the starve to death.  You try it again: This time you got your foodsupplies under control and you produce new villages like before. It seems to work pretty well. And you're out of firewood. Everyone dies.  In this game you can't just rush. You have to your (the games) time. Otherwise you die. You have to balance repopulation. Or you die.  It's genius.

I went through 3 cities before I figured out how to control the food shortage problems and the population problems. Things to keep in mind: people will not have chilrden unless you build more houses and they will not complain if you forget to. They'll just all die off of old age, leaving you with a population of deer. Unlike Rome &amp; Pharoah, you do not HAVE to build beside roads.

As sad as it is, you get emotionally attached to your little settlement, as it grows from a band of people and a wagon, to a little village, to a town and beyond. It takes a couple of 'tester' villages and a few run throughs of the tutorial, but once you get going it's difficult to stop playing.  The most refreshing part of this game is the absence of combat. Focussing on the trials and tribulations of keeping food on the table, logs on the fire, a spring in their step and the doctor at bay is a whole different ballgame... and a challenge I'm enjoying much more than building an army to wipe someone out.  Just before writing this review, I lost my first villager to old age - living into his 70's - after a career in Farming, Building, Fishing and Mining. Poor Ranson, he'll be sorely missed. Though I wont miss him anywhere near as much as Merrick, who was trampled by a boar whilst hunting. Odd, considering that I've yet to see a boar in game. RIP Merrick.  I've yet to experience any actual disasters - but at the moment over half of my population are 60+, with the rest either children or students... In a couple of years I could find myself down to 10 people... I guess that's close enough to a disaster.  Well worth buying, even if it wasn't in the sale. 10/10.",

This goes for both Board games (L'Harvre, Agricola, Stone age, etc.) and Video games (Towns being one of the biggest turn offs for me). So it was with a bit of hesitation that I opened the Store page to Banished, a higher resolution game of building a settlement from nearly scratch and making it survive. I purchased it yesterday, and for those people who want a short, quick review: TL;DR GET THIS GAME.  My play time right now is very limited. I have only clocked a few hours of this game, but I PLAN ON CLOCKING MORE. Please take this into consideration while reading this.  Starting from when I viewed the original trailer upon its release, I had hope that I may finally turn around my stroke of bad luck conscerning games like these. The game looks beautiful, runs smoothly even on somewhat dated systems, and the feel of it as you watch it run for the first time is very good. It may sound weird reading that last sentence, but it is really the only way I can explain it after seeing many games have a small lag time from when you see the title screen and when you can actually select anything from it.   The game comes with a tutorial that has a decent amount of depth to it, explaining and teaching you the basics of how to start up a small community of workers and labourers, and then does exactly what SHOULD happen after this stage: Leaves you alone. This game is set to be a strategic development game, so I would have been slightly put off if the tutorial held your hand the whole time while explaining when, why, and how you use each and every building. After learning the basic controls and solutions to problems players would experience in the first 15 minutes of game time, I found it pleasantly surprising how much of overall setting creation players get. Different seeds can be loaded, Resource availability, starting conditions, weather, even Disasters that may or may not be toggled (Cant wait till I get hit by my first tornado! :D) are all at the players fingertips right before s/he dives in to playing god.   During actual gameplay, the thing I like most is the freedom to do what you want, whether or not you will actually SURVIVE. My first town considsted of houses, a foresting agency, a fishing dock, and a mine. And by the 2nd or third year i had run out of food, had too many workers working the mine and dying of starvation, and realistically got my butt whooped by the in game Mother Nature after a half hour of game time. Starting again, I made a new town with more food production and less of other resources. Another failure, most of my food supplies died off during winter. Oh Well!  Time and Time again I have lost to this game, be it by starvation, population lock, disease, cold... And every time I lose I find myself renewed and refreshed, ready to start again and push my town further. The difficulty of the game is high, and a player will definetly need a good sense of planning and forethought to expand greatly, yet I think anyone who enjoyed games like Prison Architect, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Towns (Yikes!), and even the old Sim City games would easily fall in love with this piece.   So to end my Wall of Text review, I leave you with a Pro/Con list:  PRO  - Looks great  - Easy to navigate HUD and menus  - Freedom  - Plenty of replayability  - Lots of fun.  CON  - Difficulty is fairly high.  - (From what Ive read) Some events such as diseaased crops only give visual cues, like changed colors. Considering my play style, these might be hard to notice.",

            "review_text": "When I saw this game I was a little mixed. It sounded like it might be fun, but I wondered if it would maintain my interest. With no combat or any real meta goals besides simple survival and growth I feared it would be fun for a few hours then lose it's appeal. Add in that the price tag and I wanted to mull it over. I obviously decided to take the gamble and found myself extremely suprised and delighted. The game is deceptively simple. I say that because although the goal, gameplay, are straight foward enough, it hides a great deal of subtle complexity.   I remember my villagers starving to death the first couple times because I built two fishing piers. I figured food's done go enough. Wrong..... the amount of fish caught depends on the season, perhaps the proximity of one pier to the next also...... I'll have to tinker with that. In any case winter came fishing went kaput villagers quickly devoured the meager stockpile and that was all she wrote. That's only one of many small but meaningful complexities this game offers. Others hide you don't realize it was a mistake for a few years, then the light comes on as you see the error and must scramble to correct it before all you've worked for comes crashing down. If it takes you to long to figure it out the problem may well have snowballed beyond correction.   Because of it's seeming simplisity it is very relaxing, almost as though designed to lull one into a false sense of security. The lack of combat of any kind and focus upon survival seems to have been a very wise choice. No real bugs, game runs smooth on my old dual core processor. If I have any criticism it's minor. You can't choose your starting location on a map... period. Second regardless of the difficultity level you start each map has the same start location. The first is more a personal thing. The second however can make some maps, at hard difficulity at least, much harder than others. The same is probably true for the others to a degree. This lack of consistancy can be an annoyance, particularly when you start a map in a spot survey it and think there's no way, I'm gonna get screwed this way sooner or later. Then you have to go back and randomly gererate a new map. Getting the difficultity levels to be consistant from map probably by making the spawn different for each would put the final polish on an already excellent game. Here I'll grant I haven't played for to long yet and perhaps my skill or lack of it is giving me this illusion.  In the end if you enjoy a city builder, this one will not disappoint you. It will let you unwind, and at the same time keep your gears turning planning and considering each choice you make carefully. If your more combat oriented, sorry no soup for you.  ",

It is just you (&amp; your community) against nature.   It is simple on the face of it yet that never leaves you without anything to do. It's always a careful balance of managing resource while slowly growing your community. In fact, Too many more options and it would become complex and cumbersome. (Not that I would turn down further content to develop my towns further but it certainly doesn't 'need' anything else right now)  Furthermore, it is being developed by one man. Every single bit.

Still I would recommend the game as it is fun to see the builders do building stuff and feel the minor frustration of when sickness or fire tries to destroy the world. Banished reminds me of the old times, when we had the first Simcity or Serf City/The settlers (Google it young ones). Those were great games back then and still is!  Good things: + Nice player camera + Easy to understand menu’s + Decent graphic and good performance + Could be modded to greatness?! + Relaxing, no enemies  Bad: - Game is “mentally” short - Short on stuff to build (Old Simcity had more buildings and control.) - No goal, really, no goal (Like playing Serf City without enemies or friends.

It's very fun (especially on hard) and lets you build your city where even small mistakes can have big consquences. My first playthrough I had people freezing from lack of wood, then I had a tool shortage because of not building a blacksmith, which then led to almost everyone starving to death. You might want to watch a few getting started videos online to atleast get you going. Overall it was like no other game I've played before since you are so focused on population growth, expansion, preventing distasters, etc. instead of things like war (there are none). I think Banished is a unique one of a kind game.  Positives: + Good graphics for a city builder + Unique fun strategy game + Good variety in how you can choose to play  Negatives: - Not much map/tarrain/climate variety. They are all just randomly generated maps of hills mountains and rivers with the only climate option being mild/fair/harsh. - Some controls could be updated like being able to move people out of their house or assigning a specific person to a specific job but it can still be done with some playing around.

            "review_text": "Banished is a great experience with excellent pacing, a serene outdoorsy soundtrack, layered strategic town building gameplay, and a focused art style. I'm 20 hours into this game and I'm still finding new wrinkles.   Every game starts you out with a only a few families and a paltry amount of supplies. You command your settlers to transform a chunk or untouched wilderness into a successful town. You have to manage inventories of wood, stone, and iron resources, and make sure to make enough food and firewood to last the winter. You can expand your settlement's population by building houses for new families to move into.   The bigger your town gets, the more you can accomplish through whatever path you choose. Need food? You can farm crops, farm orchards, forage, fish, raise livestock, hunt, or trade. You can also mine coal and iron, quarry stone, and trade your resources for exotic seeds from distant settlements or a few chickens so you can start producing eggs. Choice is everywhere, and the game encourages you to try out new apporoaches. The level of strategic detail is impressive, but that doesn't mean the game is very difficult. The game does a great job of using the seasons to establish periods of surplus and times of famine. It's not a click-fest, success at the game is about following and anticipating these seasonal patterns.   The UI is really well done, because it's completely customizable. After you get of hang of it you'll find yourself sticking the info boxes around the edges of the screen like post it notes. You can have as many on the screen (or as few) as you want.  There's no combat but there are natural disasters, and you're really battling against time and nature. There's no story mode but the game does a good job of pulling you into your settler's lives by having nice touches like be able to build cemetaries and watching them fill in one by one (especailly in the early years, each death really hurts), buying a handful of cattle and seeing little calves the next spring, or having to deal with an infestation in your walnut orchards. The balance to this risk/reward gameplay allows you to tell your own stories.  It's not the most dazzling game graphically but the art is well done. The AI is pretty good too, with every citizen having different tasks depending on the job that you assign them. Banished might be too slow placed for some (though there is a fast-forward button), but for me this game scratches the same itch as any good sandbox game.",

The mechanics of the game are well implemented, and the controls are simple enough. I really don't have any complaints about Banished. Once you get the hang of it you will have a blast playing. You will either have a prosperous village or one that falls apart within years. It mainly depends on the way you set things up. If you make it too hard for the workers to get around, or over populate, etc. you will run into problems. You will probably fail multiple times before making it a few years with a semi-populated village. I actually found this to be nice though, as a lot of times 'city-builders' don't really require much thought in strategy form. The game is very good and well worth the money once you get past the learning curve. Go ahead and pick it up if your into city-builders, or even standard rts games. You'll be happy you gave it a shot.",

I like SimCity games and this is a very good game of that type, which is why I bought it and why I play it. While I think the game is very playable it does tend to get boring after a while.The reasons are I run out of things I can do. Since the only way to be successful in the game is to have a happy and growing population, I feel there should be some way to help that growth along since just building a few houses doesn't do it. Also I think some of what the traders come to trade with are way to high as it is very very hard to build up much of any kind of surplus to trade with. Plus I would like to see more things..Uhmm like flour grinding mills for example. Bakeries perhaps, make more jobs available for the population. The few professions in the game is basically what any town needs to grow. But there is room for growth beyond just surviving one disaster after another. Plus it would be nice to see some building changes, ie: add ons or something besides just stone to brick. I get over a hundred population in the town and I started getting bored as nothing changes or there is nothing I can do to change the look of the town beyond a basic scheme. Which is okay and I am not complaining as I like the game and suggest it to everyone. But I am suggesting changes and things that would make the game much more enjoyable. As far as problems or gremlins I didn't experience any of those. The game played very well on my system and doesn't take but a moment or so to load up. It is a very addictive Sim building game but I would like to see it developed much more as like I said I get a little bored after about a hundred pop and I am looking for that reset button so I can start again.",

Not recommended for anyone looking for a casual city builder - this one really requires a lot of effort and patience to succeed! The nature of the game means that half your town can be wiped out at any moment and you'll have to find a way to save it. If that kind of thing frustates you, this might not be your game. But if you love strategy, steep learning curves and constant challenges, and if a survival sim/city building hybrid sounds like your cup of tea, this is definately worth it, and you can't argue with the price.   I'd recommend  not  reading a whole lot of tips when you're first starting out, because a lot of the satisfaction comes from figuring things out yourself (especialy when 'success' can be snatched away so easily!), and you'll learn far more by seeing what doesn't work first hand.

You'll need firewood to survive the winter, food of course, and housing for all of your banished. A strong foundation will carry you far.

I never cared much for beauty and tend to build more functional cities, however, the mod support this game offers allows one to build whatever one wishes.

            "review_text": "The Journal of Arde A Banished Tale  It started in the late spring, we were banished from our homes and sent out into the wilderness with nothing but potatoes, some hide coats, meager iron tools on our trusty wooden cart. We found a beautiful valley and started the town of Quentiss.  It was rough the first season; I started by building the local fishery so we could get a sustainable food supply. We built it right on Lake Quentiss at the mouth of Fiddlemagee Creek. The fishery supplied over a thousand fish per season (with four fishermen working) but we needed to have more food than just fish. So we build the Forestry service (to ensure we had enough logs to keep building) and next to it our first hunting lodge. The hunting lodge provided us with roughly 320 venison each season (With one hunter) and 9 leather so we could make hide coats (It gets cold in Quentiss in the winter). Across the street from the Forestry service I then built a hut for the gatherers. This is the ideal location for them to find berries, mushrooms, onions and roots. The Forestry service will ensure the forest is there providing logs, which attracts the deer for the hunters and ensures a stable growth of mushrooms and berries. Next door to the gatherer’s hut we build our first medical hut, the herbalist. Again, this was ideal because many of the needed herbs to keep us healthy are only found in the Forrest.  It was our first winter and we ran out of firewood as we were completing our first home in Quentiss. It was a very cold winter and the entire town, population of 12, all huddled in my home for warmth when they needed it. Next on my list to build was the woodcutter’s yard. By the end of late spring 2, we had firewood. Next I built the black smithy and tailor’s shop. We were running low on tools by late summer 2 and needed to have tools fast. The blacksmith has kept us in great shape since. We also have over 50 hide coats thanks to our wonderful tailor Matience. Unfortunately, we were running low on iron that we could find on the surface. We needed to build a mine.   I started work on the mine in the winter of 3, the problem we had was not enough stone to make the mine. So I spent the majority of year 3 &amp; 4 gathering enough stone to build our iron mine. By late autumn of 6 the mine was open and we had a miner, Sandell, mining iron for our smithy and anything additional we needed to build. I gathered enough stone to build a second mine and built our first coal mine. This coal will allow us to upgrade our tools from iron to steel and get us more “bang for our buck” for our efforts. There is a plan to start work on our first quarry soon but we are still low on iron and a lot of iron is needed for our quarry.  As for the town as a whole, we are doing well. We have over 6,000 food, everyone is healthy and I am approaching 64 as we enter late autumn 9. I have given up building and have joined my husband Ailee in hunting. I like hunting as much as I liked building but it suits my tired body to hunt more than building.  Quentiss will need a graveyard soon as I feel my end nearing. My children, Ernellion &amp; Jadence, will want to visit me after I am gone.  With peace and respect to those that follow me and read this, Arde  (P.S. If you like and enjoy other games like Sim City, Civilization, etc., this game is a good one to add to your library) ",

Good: City sim with a different twist then I've seen before Keeps you involved, especially with allocating the work Good looking enough Enjoyable learning curve.It's rigid but enjoyable  Cons: Unclear about specific roles (what do farmers do in the winter, why would i keep them as farmers?) Certain buildings are needed to survive, while others feel thrown in to make variety.   Overall: I'm enjoying the game, and I can see myself playing it for awhile. I've had 0 issues running the game. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new city sim who enjoys a little (but not tons) of micromanagment.  ",

That isn't to say that things can't go downhill while you are busy with other things but once you get to a certain point the town can practically run itself.  The learning curve is a little steep. First attempts at playing often result in half the town dying of some cause or another but it is easy to pick up after a while.  Personally I find the random name generator amusing as the vast majority of characters are not given names that even resemble any names that I have heard of.   It does have it's quirks (people dying of starvation while there is still food in the stockpile, the blacksmith refusing to switch their broken tool for the one that they just made, people randomly wandering to a far corner of the map and dying of starvation ) but over all an enjoyable experience",

Its very frustrating to watch because once you assign jobs, even if your citizens are happy and healthy, there is no guarentee that they will do anything more than f*** all. With a smaller town this is ok as the area is small enough that it doesnt effect the village too much but once you get to your larger town you will find that the strings of fires and tornadoes coupled with stupid villagers is enough to make you want to smack your head on a wall. However, though it could use a hell of a lot of work, it could be a great game and its a great idea. Disasters such as fires have more then just the loss of buildings, it can mean loss of food/tools/clothes which really makes you think about where to place your buildings which I think is great! My main problem is that villagers will rarely stay in a job for more than 30 seconds on x5 speed. If villagers worked more consistently this would be a very enjoyable but challenging experience.

I like this sort of game, it's a rewarding form of logistics management that, in this case, doesn't go overboard with endless details that detract instead of add to the game. Not many people want a Dwarf Fortress level of insanity and this manages a pretty reasonable balance.  You manage your population with housing, your food supply though everything from gathering to fishing to farming, your professions with tools and resources - it's diverse enough that the tutorial levels are very helpful. The tutorials do miss a couple of key things though, a good example is housing. I had initially assumed that people would breed and I'd be told when a new house was built but this isn't the case, the people wont reproduce if there isn't housing already waiting, by the time I found out the population had dropped to the point that there were too many sustainability problems to keep it going.  It's a surprisingly hard game to describe without sounding dull - but anyone who has played the genre before wont be surprised by anything found here. You have to balance expandsion with population with production capacity. Though another thing that could have used more of a mention is the trading. Trading is going to be very imporant to you - it's the only way to get animals to raise for one. It's how you get additional seeds for new crops as well and, probably most imporantly, stone.  Stone is probably my biggest complaint about this game. The earth may be made of it, but you're still going to run out. First problem is that there just isn't enough free stone on the surface. You can run out of everything within a reasonable distance long before you've got more than a modest village, compounded by the fact you should be building stone homes (stone homes are very important, they use a fraction of the lumber that wooden homes need to stay warm which can lead to a runaway fuel resource problem). There are quarries to be built but they require a lot of man-power which isn't feasable at the start and create a pit that is forever-after a useless patch of land once it runs dry. No, the only way to get stone (and eventually iron and coal as well since mines are also terrible) is to trade for it. Because of this, lumber seems to be the only truely infinite resource as long as you set aside land for forestry.  In addition to needing to trade for many of these things, you may also need 2-3 trading ports to get the trader you want appearing - they don't all carry the same types of items or the same selection of them each time. It does feel like an additional burden at a pretty early stage and could probably be fixed if quarries were simply a better choice. Make them slow to mine but an endless supply. Or limited but can reclaim the land.   That said, it shouldn't be so much as to scare you off the game, just a consideration to take into account. I may update this review in the future as my town grows but for now it's a recommendation and if you like they style of game, certainly something worth $20.",

Banished takes civ-building to a whole new level and although it may be said that this game is relaxing to play, trust me - when the influenza strikes or the crop harvest fails, you will be sitting on the edge of your seat working out whether or not your people will survive.  The graphics are very pleasing with several types of housing to choose from and plenty of options for customising your village as it grows. With the added realism that you can't instantly remove structures (they have to be emptied then taken down by builders), extra thought needs to be made when placing them. It's amazing how much time you'll spend admiring your town as it grows.  I'm hoping this will be the start of things to come for Banished - there's scope for developing this game further with things like horse &amp; cart transport, shops (luxury goods), currency, inter-city trading routes, even, dare I say it, defensive structures..?  The only thing lacking at the moment is some ability to control what merchants will bring - until your first visit from a merchant carrying livestock, for example, you can't order any. So after 31 years I still don't have any sheep, cows or chickens!  Still an amazing achievement for a single developer. Well done.",

It wont be invading armies that destroy you, it will be the cold, hunger, disease to an elderly population with noone to replace it when they die, and they will die. It is these factors which I enjoy about this game and as a game that is suppose to focus on survival it does a very good job at executing it and promoting a sense of parnoid tension throughout. It is difficult because it is suppose to be difficult and there will be a lot of trial and error, but that what makes that rare moment when everything is working smoothly very satisfying and it challenges you to think beyond skyscrappers and focus on food for next winter or whether I have enough children to carry on the city.

Mismanage your workers or focus on the wrong buildings early on, and you might stand there with two or three settlers left, or even worse, with every inhabitant of your settlement dead. And there are no new settlers appearing from nowhere - only children born in your town, who need years and years until they start to work for their own food.

Lets review the Pros and Cons Pros: -Very few bugs. (Like all games there are a few that are hard to run into, but still exist) -Town's Folk AI is amazing. Unlike most other games like this that ive played, the ai on this game dont end up idling and dying off after a few hours of gameplay.  -Versitility. By this, i mean there are many different ways to play the game. You can be resource hungry (and hoard loads of stone, iron, wood etc) You can be population crazy (and create tons of homes along with an abundance of food) or you can be exploration / settlment crazy (and expand across the map as fast as you can) -Difficult. As this may be a con to some, i think the difficulty of this game adds to the gameplay. Ive made towns and thought all was going great, until winter came and 1/2 of my town froze to death, then due to the lack of farmers, 1/2 of the remaining population starved to death, only to be left with a handfull of school children which were slowely picked off by the cold. -System requirements. As i run with a pretty 'top of the line' pc, i know several friends that play this game with old school computers with no problems and without having to adjust quality settings.  Cons: -Trading. Sometimes when the trade merchant is supposed to come around on his boat he doesnt. Making waiting on him tedious. Though realistic, it adds a little bit of frustration when expecting shipments. -Travel. All your citizens walk everywhere they go. therefore if they find the need to travel across the entire map for something stupid, they will most likely freeze to death or starve to death. Though this is fairly uncommon, it is irritating. -Tutorials. The tutorial is EXTREMELY important in this game. But it doesnt cover everything, making you run to youtube for the rest. It takes some time to learn the game because of this and the tutorial is slow and boring. Not so much of a con, just a personal complaint from every time i go back to play this game.  Overall: i'd give this game a 9/10 because of its excellent development, smooth ai, and lack of bugs.  the -1 for its repetative-feeling gameplay and lack of expansion. 9/10 would starve the school children all over again.",

            "review_text": "Banished is a town-/village - building simulation with some refreshing new ideas, spiced up with some long-lost components which were not seen in this genre in the last few years.  Whatever you build or command, it has effects for at least several (playing minutes), if you don't fast forward the game speed constructing several buildings can easily take 15-20 minutes, based on their location and the materials needed. The workers have to clear the construction side from rocks and trees, have to bring the materials to the spot, and after all this the construction itself can begin. Since your workers are not only workers but also human, they got to do lunch-breaks, or go home to warmup from time to time if the temperature is low.  Banished simulates much more than many other games do, not only the single working processes of the workers, but also their life outside of work - getting food and firewood for their homes etc. is simulated for every individual villager (a thing the big 'Sim City' didn't manage to achieve).  Interesting fact: The game was crafted by one (ONE!) developer, this man kicked some big game studios' asses. The graphics aren't up-to-date of course, but they are still nice to look at, especially considerung ONE (i cannot stop to mention this) single person took care of all aspects of the game.  The game isn't perfect, but it is getting patched constantly and also will get mod-support soon, which will make the options and possible content explode.  If you are into the genre, dare to give this little gem a chance.  And please- eventhough it's DRM free, buy the game. People who invest that much of their freetime, taking the risk of all that time being lost because their game gets lost in the abyss of the videogame market, deserve it.",

If that doesn't sound interesting, this is not the game for you.  The graphics are great and the variety of action is amazing in a game that as an amazingly small footprint.  There are bugs, glitches and weird behaviour, but nothing to distracting and somethings which could be part of the game.   Like when my farmers did not plant their crops one year. Could be that as with the orchards that occasionally need to be chopped down, my soil was overused. But without some notice I was left to assume that it was bug. Luckily my town survived.  These bugs could be devastating. Some will mention a fisherman starving while carrying food and yes I can see that as frustrating. But they should be able to get to their home to eat quickly or you haven't setup a very nice town. If you imagine them as robots that walk for hours to pick up an entire tree and return...wrong game. These people work for a while, then rest. If its cold they go in to warm up. Make the job easy enough that you could do it and your townsfolk will thrive.  The bugs that bug me, are labourers clearing trees from a building location, hauling the logs to a stockpile, putting them down and then picking them back up to take back and deliver to the same location. I understand the programming logic must be complicated for so many different sprites. But I wish they'd just leave it.  Otherwise, there is nothing that slowing down alittle and taking your time won't solve. You need to err on the side of caution. It took me 4 years of storing a little ale to get enough for the chickens. In the end it was all worth it.  Next come the sheep!",

Like with life, there is no aim to the game, even when everyone dies the game continues, albet a little less interesting. if I had to give it one it would be to create long lasting stable society with a happy and healthy populus. You'll quickly find that iron and stone, resources vital for construction and maintenance, become rare, and you'll need to develop strong trade routes or even mine for it. The best source of food comes from Gatherers huts though 11 X 11 farms are useful too with 2 people each and nearby storage. I'm a huge fan of bean farming as beans feed everyone. I'd also watch out for building too many homes in one area, I did once and ended up going from 800 people to almost 0 . Again a fantastic example of how even successful society's collapse. You also need to plan ahead, especially when resources are in short supply. One of the issues I've had on a small few of the random maps is some villagers get bugged and do stupid things, like walking miles through the woods for no reason and freezing or starving to death. At this point it's almost worth giving up as the maps bugged and populus will keep dying.   Overall it's a great game, and though it seems simple it's kind of deep too.",

I run a slower computer at the time of writing this and I don't get very good frames but because it is managable I haven't quit the game.    Removing buildings/resources is simple and quick. The AI is very good and has a simple way to do that kind of stuff. It is also easy to understand the buttons if you have never played a city-building game before.    Diasters make the game seem difficult in a way since you are always worrying about your city being destroyed and some gamers like a sense of worry and fear. That will be good for these type of people.    Those are just SOME of the things I like about this game. You should check out the game for yourself and see what you like about the game.

It provides a challenging learning curve with an approach to city building I have not experienced before. I cannot tell you how many times I had all my people die to starvation. So when you finally get a self-sustaining economy that you can sit back and watch, it feels extremely rewarding.  Pros:  Re-Playability, I could play this game over and over and over. The procedurally generated world just allows for new experiences purely based on the environment you play in.   Achievements, this is partially linked to re-playability because the achievements give you ideas on different ways to try and sustain your economy, for example the One with Nature achievement where you can only live off the land.   Graphics, the graphics are low poly but suit the game so well.   Rewarding, as I said early, this game has a lot of really rewarding moments. Nomads arriving at your town, completing achievements, etc. This is what keeps me coming back.   Cons:   I had trouble coming up with cons so this is mostly a suggestion. I wish there was a way to easily save a seed that you like to play on. Currently I just have a few saves that are at the start of the game before I do anything and just load whichever I want to play but this seems like a bulky way to do it because I now have to sift through all my other saves.

It feels like, to me, getting everything almost perfect is critical to the survival of your people. Don't think I'm complaining, though! Getting a city to flourish is so incredibly satisfying, all the more so because it doesn't happen every time. There is a real sense of accomplishment watching your city grow.  However, it also means that problems you encounter are very difficult, sometimes impossible, to overcome. This game really teaches you that hindsight is 20/20. I would advise having a few different save files.  City management games can easily become tedious, but Banished has never felt so. There are definite stages. The founding of your city is, as I said above, the more difficult. Once your resources are sufficiently built up, you enter a stabilization phase, building population and expanding your city. The endgame is mostly trading for unrenewable resources, and can get a little monotonous, but it takes a while.  Banished is a truly beautiful game. The graphics are detailed without being overdone. I've never had lag or framerate issues. The soundtrack is similarly engaging, without being distracting.  The controls are a bit odd, but comfortable once you get used to them.   The Workshop is full of useful or fun mods, addressing balancing/peeves or creating new buildings.   All in all, 7.5/10.",

Your enemy, at first, is the environment. You'll quickly realize, however, that your enemy is actually the people you want to protect.   I decided to run with this concept and to fight against some of the silly things my citizens did and found the game to be enjoyable! These settlers like to stop harvesting food so they can walk 300 blocks home to eat the same food they were harvesting. They walk right past the materials they need to construct a house for their children to live in so they don't freeze to death. They walk all the way across the map to get a tool when there are 500 in storage next to their own home. The list goes on and on. Because of this, I swear my citizens are suicidal.   I decided to not make it so easy for them! They'll die when I dang well decide they can die! In over 100 hours of game play I learned how to control my own population growth. I learned how to get people fed when they didn't want to eat. I learned how to keep them warm when they refused to wear a warm coat. I swear its like I'm raising a two year old. I need an airplane spoon mod that makes buzzing sounds when my food count is low!  In a weird twist of fate Banished casts your ally as your nemisis. If you enjoy an unforgiving challenge then I definitely recommend giving Banished a shot! If you think the ai should do all the work for you, steer clear.",

That simple concept is what makes this game great.  Banished is essentially a real time city builder game, where there is no real end goal, apart from loosely aiming for the in-game achievements. Set more or less in a medieval era, you must run your town, providing food, shelter, education, and a generally good quality of life to the citizens of your town. The core of the game is around balancing of resources, and making sure all essentials are kept in check. No food and citizens starve. No shelter and they freeze to death come winter. No healthcare and a plague could wipe out the populace. Now trust me when I tell you that when your resources become imbalanced and a shortage of something occurs, civilisation can fall very, very fast. This created tension, and when you are trying to push your town to the limits, avoiding this certain death can make the game so addictive, because in the back of your mind you know this game will be unforgiving if you make a mistake. The graphics are also tidy for a fairly simple game.  The brutality of this came can also be a downside however, as if you have spent a lot of time building a town for something to go wrong and it more or less dies out, rebuilding or starting from scratch could seem too much work for some players, so they might just give up there. Also there is limited replayablity here. Granted if you play this game to its potential it should get you 40+ hours (thats how long my main playthrough lasted, max pop ~980), but there's not too much incentive to play on after hitting the 900 population achievement, apart from going for a few of the more challenge like achievements.  Summary: Pros: -Simple concept -Addictive gameplay -Tidy graphics -Unforgiving gameplay creates tension  Cons: -Unforgiving gameplay could be frustrating -Somewhat limited replayability.  Final Verdict: 8.5/10 A very good game for a few dozen hours fun. Highly recommended.  ",

While I love many other city builders this one is clearly different. The challenge is left to the natural, such as running short of firewood in winter, peeps starving due to an exorbitant population, or running short on workers due to slow progression. There are no 'artificial' type scenarios which one may experience with other strategy games.  I find Banished completely immersive and can lose MANY hours while playing. Zooming in and watching this stunning game is truly addictive. Watching your peeps move goods, listening to them tinker, from relaxing to the sounds of rain, to hearing the animals. Can even have ASMR benefits, no? Just me maybe.  Banished may take many playthroughs to learn all the intricate details required to perfect this fine balancing act of a game. Once mastered, however, its appeal may dwindle. While there are many tricky achievements to get, there is no campaign mode for example to keep your whistle wet.",

            "review_text": "Seven out of ten.  Banished is a slow paced town builder, set around the later middle ages of history, you and your available families build housing, storage, work places and try to create a flourishing city. The game has the pacing of molasses in winter, but at least initially it's good that it is that way as it gives you some time to work your way around things such as the menus, structure placement and citizen arrangements. You can also turn the game to 10x simulation speed if you're more impatient, but it's still a rather tedious game. Banished like all city builders echews combat for a peacful experience of struggling against different foes such as starvation and disease, space management. Foes that should not be underestimated as the intial contest for your life can be surprisingly difficult without proper attention. Once you have it figured out, it's quite quaintly enjoyable to build your blocks of houses, your city center with the town hall and market, and your pastures out in the fields. Banished though, does run a bit dry lacking a certain depth other city builders have achieved before it. You realize not long in that there simply isn't much to do over the first hurtle, and for a city builder, it's very lacking in the creative aesthetics that grant such enormous replayability to the other games of its kind.  Speaking of aesthetics, Banished wins me over just slightly in that regard. It's a rather pretty game in a quiet way. Watching the trees grow and fade over the seasons is just a touch of pleasantry that carries further than I might have thought. The buildings are well modeled and textured, though I found the villagers themselves to look a bit outdated. Water, and weather are nothing special but they do alright for the game, but the most disappointing feature is perhaps the single looping track that plays for the game. Okay, maybe not just the one, but the music while good is just lacking and gets a bit tired before you've even finished your first town (Discounting an early death as the hands of cruel nature).  In summary, Banished is a slow game and a good game, the problem being there just isn't enough of it. Worth it to pick up on a sale, perhaps not at full price.  Unofficially, the 'Colonial Charter' mod (Available through the workshop) adds some considerable value to the game, adding to nearly every aspect, perhaps even tripling the games content. Should you play the game, I heavily recommend trying this and other mods to add to the experience.",

            "review_text": "Almost more of a survival game than a city-builder.   This is one of those games that I turn on when I want to play something but not need to use two hands or give constant attention to. It is slower paced, even at 5x speed, but it scratches an itch.   Achievements are varied and some require actual thought and skill which is nice. If you don't pay attention, things can go downhill fast, though. When that happens, it's hard (though not impossible) to recover.   I enjoy the graphics and the pleasant soundtrack. It's mostly soothing though. It would be nice to have a more urgent soundtrack when things start going downhill.  One gripe is that scrolling starts to sideshow when there's too much on screen (like lots of trees).   Another is that the trading ships are not very user friendly. You have to be patient if you want something specific from them (even if you 'order' it). Would also be nice if you could have more outside contact or interaction.   Recently added mod support is giving new life to the game by adding more resources and such. Some can be game breaking, some can be essential.  It would be nice if there were a storyline or more of an external impetus to do things. After you get past the 'are we going to starve next season or not' hump, there's not a whole lot I feel like I need to do but just grow bigger.  Also, the farmers could use some love. I find they start harvesting too late or are too inefficient. With the first snowfall often coming in late autumn, I lose a lot of crops. Some wheelbarrows or pulling in other helpers would be nice.

The textures, models, and graphics are all incredibly pleasing to the eye. In my 19 hours, I haven't encountered any graphical errors or glitches. It runs extremely well on my medium-to-low tier rig.  The soundtrack is very calming and aways seems to fit the situation that your town is in, When I find myself running short on food or in the middle of a very harsh winter, the music will become more intense.  It took me forever to figure out how to get my village to sustain itself, but it was challenging in the fun way, not the irritating way.

            "review_text": "Who is this Game For? ================== Something that’s important to clarify with Banished is its classification as a city-builder. I don’t want to get too far into a discussion about semantics, but Banished is less of a true city builder in the same vein as the SimCity games, and more of a game about survival, expansion, and fighting against both the elements of nature, as well as the innate desire to progress. So while this game is for fans of ‘city-builders’, you need to understand its a little less builder and more of a survival and expansion city-builder.  Is it good? ================= This tension of total failure and destruction prevalent in the game keeps it exciting and engaging throughout. Knowing that at any time things could go wrong helps keep you on your toes, a constant reminder to take a moderate pace to expansion and think through every move. Banished utilizes this fear of failure to encourage you to find the best build orders and locations, and as well as adopt early population management strategies.  Does it have any problems? ======================== However, this is the crux of the game, and because the building mechanics are fairly stripped down to their bare essentials, the amount of enjoyment you extract from it will depend on whether or not the tension of survival clicks with you. Mods might be able to fix this for you, but your mileage may vary.   Final Thoughts! ==================== It’s a bit of a shame, because the core of Banished is so solid and rewards careful play, but it emphasizes a shallow expansion rather than one with any real substance. It challenges you to make your city bigger and bigger, but not necessarily better or more advanced. On the bright side, mod support has been promised in the future, and there is definitely a ton of potential for the community to pick up right where the developer left off, as well as expand in all sorts of wacky and fun directions.",

They have only the clothes on their backs and a cart filled with supplies from their homeland. The townspeople of Banished are your primary resource.  Banished is a load of fun, but can be quite challenging, one moment your town is booming, and the next disease wipes out half your people. its a very unique city builder, instead of levels or time to build, you simply need materials, and then your people build the structure. you can build any structure at any time, provided you have the materials. of course, like any game, it has its pros and cons, which i will list here.  Pros: -Very enjoyable, unique gameplay. -has infinite playability, as its just as challenging when your population is 400 than when its 25. -a wide variety of mods are available, making adding new content simple. -very basic concept, making getting into the game very easy.  Cons: -Very difficult to get started, i reccomend you look up a tutorial on how to get started. -Poor citizen AI system. the citizens are hard to control, and really do what they want, rather than what you want.  Overall: i would rate this game 8/10 1 point lost for the difficulty of starting, and another 1 point for the AI system. i would highly reccomend getting this game, its fun, challenging, and can be run on just about any computer you can get on.",

When you think your food reserves are enough, and that unforeseen baby boom happens and half your population ends up dying to hunger; it's unfortunate. You still have the surviving population to work with, and all the infastructure all ready to go for when you reach a higher population again. So you adapt your strategy, your food reserves are booming, and you once again have the high population. But now half your population dies again to old age, because majority of the surviving half from the previous catastrophe is much older than the new generations that followed. Ok... Adapt once more - focus on food, force the remaining population to baby boom. But once again, half your population dies. Why did they die this time? Not enough workforce between the old men and the toddlers to forge and distribute clothing, firewood, and stone houses(opposed to wood houses) for warmth.   You have to micromanage every factor, every citizen, every need for survival on a grand scale to build the ultimate utopia. Balance is the name of the game. Oddly enough, the only thing you don't have to worry about it being raided by bandits, invaded by neighboring settlements, or being eaten alive by wolves..  6/10 Would be higher if there were wolves.  Good for a cheap game. You can play for maybe an hour or two to pass the time.

Could be the great soundtrack, how easy it is to just pick up and play, or the pretty graphics.  There are a few problems, though, apart from the tutorial. AI seems to be all over the place. I tell people to do one thing and they just end up doing whatever the hell they want. Nothing gets built for like 3 months until the builers finally stop gathering resources that we don't exactly need. You're also not told what each job does, exactly. For example, I didn't know laborers went and gathered resources. At the beginning all they did was wander around aimlessly doing nothing. Only after a lot of messing around did they finally start cutting trees down and getting stone. This is mostly because of the first problem, the tutorial.

With 120hrs on record, I haven't yet found a rhythm that can help me ascend to the greats and build a town that doesn't fall apart over a small span of time. One second I have more food than... Well, I have a lot of food, and lots of tools and resources and the works, the next minute my citizens are dying off and my town is up in metaphoric flames.  But I think that's the beauty of this game. I've played consistently on either easy/medium difficulty with disasters off, and I *still* can't exhaust the avenues of this game. There's such a learning curve, it's astounding. One day, perhaps when I have 300hrs on record, I'll graduate to turning on natural disaters, but we'll see... There are some complaints that there isn't much to this game, and I suppose when you look at the 'tech' or the buildings you can produce, that's correct, but the very fact that the game can be so simple in concept and yet so complex in its gameplay and its outcome - shows this game for the gem it really is.  I will admit that some of the negative reviews on here that point out the sometimes frustrating AI have a fair point, but every game has its issues, and I think these downfalls are more than made up for by the beautiful style, gameplay, and concept. Couple this with a beautiful and relaxing soundtrack and you have a game that you can never stay mad at when it kicks you in the teeth and wipes out your town, because it was all down in the picturesque landscape with a soothing track to keep you distracted. Another comment on here I think perfectly sums up why this game is worth every penny: you can leave this game for months/years at a time (I know, that's how I play it), but then you get the powerful urge/itch to play it, and nothing else will fill that void other than Banished. It is timeless, and I genuinely think it'll be classic in an age when we're looking at countless CoD sequels etc.  The playability is further boosted (if you could boost it any further) by the vast array of mods that open up the possibilities with more buildings and new mechanics. To name but a few, the mods by Redketchup will add at least another 500hrs to your gameplay.  So, I think for the mere price of £15, if you're thinking of getting Banished, think no more, buy it now!",

Depending on your chosen level of difficulty - various options available in the start new game menu - You start off with a number of families, supplies and sometimes even with structures already built. Your little town of banished families grow up, have children, grow old and die. The strategy comes along with making sure their basic needs are met: Food, warmth, shelter, health, tools. Educated citizens are well worth it, but then maintaining all of the needs depends on how mnay working adults you have available.   Despite the amount of time I have on record I still get sucked into each new game I start. Added on the CC colonial mod addition and while the same basic needs are there, the variety of 'how' to meet those needs is significantly expanded upon and will allow the creation of your very own kingdom - if you can get everybody to survive and reproduce enough to have the citizen count for all the jobs.

Amonst thinking I was doing things right, then takes me eyes off the tools for a moment and suddenly everyone is starving to death because they can't procure food fast enough due to the lack of tools. For awhile, I stopped playing thinking it was too hard and somewhat unfair (the land generation can be pretty cruel though).  After coming back to it again, learning a few tricks for myself, I saw the game a bit better. I managed to get a population of 1000+ people and getting about 70% of the achievements in 1 town. It was a really fun endeavor to reach that milestone for me.  The game has a few flaws of course. Workers living and working on opposite ends of the map, the tiniest hills are a pain in the butt, old people taking up living spaces from young couples who I need to make me more children but can't because the old people just don't die..., and then there is the lag. I have a pretty decent (not high end but more like medium end) rig but as the town gets bigger you WILL notice the lag, espically if you run at 10X speed. My 1000+ town caused so much lag at 10X speed that 5X speed ended up being faster... and even that was laggy. (8-11 fps VS 18-22 fps).  A few other issues pop up every now and then but in the long haul, the game is enjoyable with a good touch of challenge. It feels pretty rewarding to see the town grow. After that though the game loses replayability unless you are going for 100% achievements. (have fun btw.... 200 years is like 72 hours of running gameplay, twice as so considering the 10-20 fps you get with large towns).  I recommend the game, but only if it is on sale, honestly. It'll consume a good chunk of time until you've played it through like me.",

Let me tell you what you do in it: -Get banished from the kingdom of ?????? because you and the rest of the inhabitants did ???????? -Grow crops -Dig giant holes in the ground -Dig giant implied holes in the side of a mountain -Have a family of two hog the first and only house in the village so far while everyone else freezes outside -Occasionally have a trader row (just row. there's no land trade to speak of so even if you're in a relatively flat area where you'd expect caravans you just get one ♥♥♥♥ in a row boat) and try to barter some beans with you -Make a church so the already insanely happy people are even happier -Make a tavern so the already insanely happy people are even happier, and drunk -Make a hospital so everyone doesn't die from the chicken pox or something -Make a town hall so you can get pretty graphs and detailed accounts on how many potatoes Joe Blow has stuffed in his kitchen cupboard  And, well, that's pretty much it. Nothing wrong with that. It's a great start and I do enjoy what little there is. My issue comes with the 'completed' status and the fact I've seen maybe one update since I bought the game several months ago (which as far as I can tell was mostly just bugfixes). There's simply not enough game here.  Like I said, it's fun. I won't deny I enjoy watching my little lemming men run around, chop trees, and build roads so straight and villages so organized it'd send the Romans into a fit of envy. I'm just left wondering 'what about all the other stuff?' Where are the wild animals that tear lonely loggers to shreds if they venture too far from town? The bandits and barbarians who threaten to raze the city if they don't get a tribute of food? As far as I can tell getting banished from ?????? for ?????? (It really doesn't fill you in on any of this. I'm sure someone will pass it off as 'leaving it up to the player' but anyone with any idea of how to write things can tell you that's lazy writing) was more of a blessing than a curse, because if you don't make outright stupid decisions your village will be flourishing in a matter of years, and there's just not enough to threaten that prosperity. The winters mean less and less as your wooden buildings are turned to stone and your leather coats are lined with the wool from the sheep you traded six trillion beans for. Outbreaks are handled quickly and efficiently by the magical witch doctor that just rubs some plants on the afflicted's face until they're suddenly better. The only thing that will eventually theoretically threaten your village (assuming you play this long before getting bored) is running out of room for graveyards from all the people that eventually die from old age, and I'm sure even that could be avoided by keeping everyone happy enough they don't care Old Man Jenkins's carcass was thrown into the woods for the nonexistent wolves to tear apart. I'm not really angry. I'm just disappointed. There's too little game here where there should be, and I'm finding myself questioning the legitimacy of its 'completedness'. I'm sure I'll be Not Helpfulled into oblivion by the raving drones that insist it was money well spent and can't take a lick of criticism, but all I can say is welcome to the reviews section, kids.",

            "review_text": "Banished is a strange game. It has a great aesthetic - especially in the winter - that is compelling enough to keep you coming back for more. There's nothing quite like the sight of your little village covered in a blanket of snow, smoke billowing out of every chimney. Aesthetic, however, isn't really enough to hold your focus for too long. Other reviews go into great detail about what you need to do to succeed but it can be summed up in two parts - gather resources and breed.   At first this can be a fun balancing act to play out. Too much breeding and you're resources will start to dry up fast, too little and you'll struggle to get those resources quick enough to sustain your population much less grow it. Once you find the happy medium that works for your village you can plug along fairly well, at least for a while. Banished is big on throwing natural disasters at you - or at least it was for me. In three consecutive playthroughs I had things moving along wonderfully when a tornado would touch down and level my town. My population was decimated and despite my best efforts all three towns eventually died out.   Overall, that's the issue with Banished. It's not so much a city builder so much as it's a city survival game. The AI doesn't help, either, as citizens of your town can be frustratingly foolish. More than once I watched a citizen wander into the forest looking for food only to starve to death out in the wilderness when there was a surplus of food sitting in the barn for them. An even worse example for you: I once had a town starve to death despite it being flushed with productive farms. Over half of my population were farmers, herdsman, and fishermen and they still somehow found a way to starve to death, all of them. There's nothing more bleak and yet ironic than watching a farmer harvest his crops, the only person residing in a town of once over 50, slowly starving to death. And rest assured, the farmer died just like all of his friends and family, starving to death in the middle of his field.Throw a tornado or fire in on top of that, leveling a perfectly good town in its prime, and the game can become painfully frustrating.   Banished is not a bad game but like most of the reviews on here, I'll tell you the truth - there's not a lot to it. You can build a sprawling metropolis if you want but there's nothing to do with it. There's no end-game, nothing to strive for beyond trying to surive as long as possible. You can't go out and get revenge on the town that kicked out your founders or even interact with other villages. Your only contact to the outside world are solitary traders, the only evidence of life outside of your village. This game could be easily be cast as settling another planet for the first time, it's that empty. If you can get it on sale for cheap, buy it. It is fun at first and, like I said, can be beautiful in a quaint, colonial kind of way. Just understand that after a while it will lose its spice.",

I think the asking price is a bit much for a game that gets boring very soon after you have played about 20 hours. For a city builder, it's unique in that you have to manage a wide array of basic resources to survive. However, it's also very short for a city builder.   Once you attain a population of about 300 or more, there simply is no reason to play the game any longer. There needs to be a 'next-level' for players, after they've built past the survival stage, where grander buildings, regional conflicts (perhaps building an army for defense), or new villager specialist professions become available.  I've been waiting for almost a year for updates in this game that would bring it to the next level, and offer a fuller building experience. I've held off writing my review in lieu of the developer's promise to improve the game. Yet, alas, it seems those promises were false.   If one has money to spend, and wants to try something different for a small amount of time, they maybe will feel ok spending the $20.00 on this game. However, If you want a more enjoyable long-lasting game, buy Sim City 4. It's also only around $20.00 and is far superior to this game.",

You do the same things over and over and over again working slowly -- emphasis on the slowly -- to expand your settlement. If you expand to fast you die; if you expand too slow you also die. Leaving you with this middle ground of 'just right' expansion speed that really makes the game incrediably dull. It takes forever to do much of anything, and for large chuncks of the game I was waiting on the merchant to bring me animals.   I gave up after 10 years with out a single merchant bringing animals. I did have the same guy turn up six times in a row selling the same single type of fruit I had started with.   That really sums up the game you can be doing everything right and end up screwed over because the AI is just awful.   I'm sure other reviewers have mentioned the issue where people starve because the farmers won't go harvest their crops -- that happened. But even worse than that was the total illogical issue where the game seems to struggle with allocating materials in logical ways.  Even with low caps set on EVERYTHING that used wood were still freezing to death because EVERY SINGLE OTHER THING that needed wood got it before the woodcutter. It's so frustrating to have to micromange things that the AI should be smart enough to figure out.",

It's basically a really neat city builder kind of game set in a pretty simple medieval-esque setting, no combat, no deeper overlaying faction mechanics, diplomacy, nada, just survival in the wilderness, and making your little halmet grow. And that's really cool and great and all -- when you have everything perfectly and tediously set up beforehand.  See, the problem is, that as your town starts growing, your citizens AI begins to act haywire.  Even getting them to their very best, ie issuing them warm coats, giving them proper education, making sure they are healthy and well fed, and clear stone paths to their general work areas, they will still get stuck in these asinine chain of actions that can ultimately kill your town or make simple instructions take up towards a while year.  Like take a builder for example. You instruct your builders to build say, a fishing dock, relatively nearby the town, set that junk to be prioritized (which is a function that does virtually nothing).  The builder will (not neccesarily in this order, and also sometimes several times until completion): 1) Go pick up stones from the entirely opposite end of the village to store in the stockpile 2) Go pick up food twice 3) Walk to the construction site, store some building materials, and do something entirely different 4) Go visit the herbalist 20 times 5) Walk to the construction site, and then decide to walk all the way back home because he feels cold 6) Walk to the construction site, build 1%, and then go do something else 7) Go build 3 tiles of road somewhere else 8) Go visit the herbalist, again  And this sort of thing applies to any profession that has the citizen walking anywhere, so imagine what a sucker I felt like seeing my 15 laborers ignore cutting down the prioritized tree farm for a whole year and making my town freeze to death twice.  Like damn man, I used to play Dwarf Fortress of all games, so I really do want to consider myself to be patient with strange AI behavior, but this game just gets absurd with that sometimes, to the point where it can be completely game breaking.  A lot of people talk about how the game is hard too. And sure, it can be a bit of a challenge early on while you set everything up, but once you are starting to stabilize things you kinda start to get the impression that a large part of the 'difficulty' is actually related to how terrible the AI can be at doing their tasks.  So look, it's a pretty sweet game overall, so by all means do buy it and try it out. Just be prepared to savescum and get endlessly frustrated by your citizens AI a bunch.",

I've been cutting trees like Isengard and it wasnt enough. So you'll want to go with coal mines, right? 30 workers in a coal mine makes 7000 coal at max which is not enough. And each person eats 100 food per year so in big picture you exchange 30.000 food for 7.000 coal. And that's a lot of food.  This issue made me crazy so thats why i stopped playing.

            "review_text": " Intro  The game type is not only sandbox, but a  full  sandbox game: indeed it lacks any type (really any type) of goal. The game genre is a strategic medieval city management with stunning graphics and it has (maybe) the better season system I've ever seen.   Pros  - 3D graphic and visuals are wonderful; - music is good also if there are just three or four songs and that's it; - season system is really realistic and well represented into the game; - in the first game the morale will be destroyed by death of a family member and the cemetery is used also to replenish it: it's totally realistic; - trade is another realistic thing: to me is ok but for someone could be too much 'real'.   Cons  - total lacking of plot and goals: just survive in a random generated land; - it gets repetitive: any scenario will force you to find the same configuration of buildings to survive (i.e.: forester+gatherer will be the first of your problems in any scenario also with food buildings). The total absence of research and progression in time will render the game just more repetitive: it's merely the same building after one hour of play and the same after twenty; - no campaign and no friend or enemies to interact with anyway no interaction at all with anyone; - after you've decided a scenario is done (because resource is limited or because you're satisfied or because simply you've no more building space) the only strong reason to play another one is a passion for the Steam achievements.   Conclusion  Banished with some more attention and variety could've reached the Olympus of the strategy games. Unfortunately the game is really survive and that's all. Apart from that this game reminds me the first in The Settlers serie: ok in 1993 graphics are not like that :) but the concept is the same. I abandoned The Settlers at the sixth level because I found it repetitive: any new scenario brought more or less the same challenges but at least they are masked with some interaction with enemies and a progression in difficulty. In Banished I felt the same sensation... at the first scenario: for me it's inconceivable to have the same let's say configuration at the first hour and at the tenth. Nothing evolves in Banished.  So to appreciate or not this game depends on the type of player you're: I have limited time to play, I love plot, character/condition evolution, research, development and of course strategy. If you're like me, then you could find this game frustrating and maybe found something better to invest the limited time in. If you have plenty of time to invest in playing and you cannot sleep until you've obtained every Steam achievement in the universe, then definitely Banished it's for ya ;)",

            "review_text": "To start of: Banished is a city builder type of game in the same vein as Age of Mythology, Anno series, The Settlers, Children of the Nile, ect. But how the game differs is in its design philosophy: Namely the game isn't so much about upgrading your settlements like in many of the aforementioned game and combat doesn't even exist at all.  This is where the greatest enemy is the environment itself. Unless you play on a very easy setting - you will be controlling a small group of people who settle in a quite cold biome resembling the northen europe/russia climate which means; very harsh winters and a single harvesting opportunity in autumn.  The game takes place in medieval times - they live in relatively poorly insulated tree houses which require fuel to sustain heat during the winter. The fuel is either coal dug from mines or firewood chopped from regular lumber. To keep this resource in a steady supply thereforth becomes a priority.  The other challenge is farming. In most other city builders you can sustain your population with relatively low amounts of farmers or less amount of effort, more in vein with the modern farming revolution that allows more farming with less manpower. In this game however you need to dedicate at the absolute minimum 50% of your population to gathering food from different sources. This becomes a rather important issue throughout the whole game regardless of your population size. Since farmlands take up a lot of space, it presents an interesting dilemma for how you're supposed to plan your village. It doesn't work very well to try and plan like a city where farms are at the edges of society. Instead they need to be an integral part of where you put your housing for your people. If you think this is boring to read about - then you might not like this game. It is very important part of the game sadly that the game is very unforgiving about. Sometimes famines happen due to a overconsumtion of a few families, which makes food gathering so very important and even a relatively short famine has devestating effects that are nigh impossible to stop - often reducing your population with 75% which in turn makes it harder to gather food.  When you get the food situation under control - you then need to make sure that your villagers can surivive the winter. Since climate gets quite cold during the winter you need to make sure that they have enough fuel. Thankfully this isn't as big an issue sometimes and can be helped in a number of more ways than farming. For example; in addition to providing more fuel you can also provide coats of leather, wool or both (which you aquire from livestock and hunting). You can also upgrade your houses from wooden houses to stone houses. Stone being a more difficult material to gather and requiring more manpower makes this largely a very late game thing. Especially when the woodcutters start to run out of convenient space and any reduction in your citizens needs are incredibly helpful. The benefits of building stone houses early exists but are ultimately rather small to begin with.  This sort of makes winter an easy thing to deal with for anyone knowing what they're doing, and really - these are the only two needs for the citiziens to be satisfied. There are two other needs which are health and happiness but from what I've played - and I haven't played a lot: I haven't seen any need for satisfying health or happiness. My citizens live up until the 70 ages which in my opinion sounds like a massive lot in those times. Especially considering that most age related diseases starts at 40 - 50 years of age and only escalates. With that in mind I think that the game's idea of people's life expectancy is a bit unrealistic.  Happiness is satisfied in two ways: Religion and Drinking. You can build chapels and taverns in the village where the population gathers to pray or drink their problems away. But there's no interesting dynamic to them. Everybody in the village seem to be able to become a member of a church, but they don't seen to take any time off to really go and pray. But I don't know if it's the same with taverns.  Health is satisfied in two ways too. You can keep your citizens healthy through a varied diet so growing different corps has a benefit in that regard. And there's also a herbalist building which gathers herms in 'ancient forests' which increases health as well. Since the game doesn't seen to have any mechanics of sickness (of exclusion of diseases which are not cured by herbalists but by doctors in a hospital), the importances of placing herbalists seem to be more trouble than it's worth.  Diseases like I mentioned before are another aspects of the game: Namely catastrophies. These events are either fires or diseases. These seem to happen very rarely with low populations so again - it's a late game thing, but they're easy to solve. In the case of disease: Putting down a hospital or two makes it so that all sick people gathers there and are kept from the rest of your healthy population. Often they even get cured there somehow and can later return to the workforce with a surprisingly low amount of consequences. You combat fires by placing out wells around the town for your citizens to pull water from. Since I never have experienced a fire - I cannot even tell how that mechanic work.   So to summarize: This is a game with a bunch of elements, that it tries to keep realistic. You mostly sit and wait for your workers to grow crops, grow the population, put down more places where crops are supposed to grow, waiting for them to gather materials (which I forgot to mention, but it's takes a long time and requires a lot of manpower). Sadly the game just isn't very fun. There are no interesting dynamics in play here. Yes people need to eat, yes people need to be kept warm. These are good basic mechanics, but what about town events or entertainment or traveling minstrels or raiders? The village seem so very isolated and it makes the game seem so much more barebones than its competitors. I think the game could have used some more time to think up better dynamics because ultimately it's boring to watch people strolling around and collecting stuff and waiting for opportunities to expand. This makes the player a slave to the game instead of the other way around which I think it should be. I like city builders a lot but this is in my opinion a poor one. You might still like it thanks to its difficulty but for me it was not a lot that I felt was worth going through the difficulty to make it feel rewarding enough - thereforth I don't recommend this game.",

Where to begin.... i could say the same thing as so many other 'farmers starving while harvesting' but i wont. Instead how about a crop field being worked by 6 farmers (max) not clearing the harvest before winter takes it away, mind you my storage barns are right next to the fields. How about the respawn rate of herbs and gatherer items. Even placed in a dense forest they drop off very sevrerly after the 2nd year. lets talk about the ai pathing, even with stone roads placed to every building/field/stockpile they still decide to cut a straight line to their destination. while on the topc of AI how much sense does it make that a single person living in a home takes 300 units of venison and 150 units of squash. even with a market the people take way more food than they need. Moving on.... the mining and stone cutting speed OH MY GOD. a whole year to mine 45 iron with 10 miners, again stockpile stupid close to the mine. Also the aging system, children take 3-4 years before they become laborers or students but people can die of old age in 3-4 years, really. By year 35 i had a lost probably 45 citizens to old age. i get maybe the shortened lifespan due to primative conditions but it wasnt that friggin short.

On the other hand there's not much challenge once you “figure it out” and so the replay-ability is not there. Overall, I might think $10 justifiable if it were a final game (and give it a different rating then), but as it's not complete yet I think it's overpriced considering what you get. If you are considering this purchase, I would say wait until a 'final' version is released and hopefully some more features will have been added to justify the cost (and hopefully the price won't go up).  The Good  What Banished does well, it does really well. It is quick to learn and much of it is very intuitive. Most of what you need to know is right in the tutorials which don't suck up your time but leave you feeling like you are ready to tackle the world.  The interface is easy to use and you won't find yourself going from window to window trying to figure out what just happened and why. There are information windows, but these can be kept open and put out of the way so that “the game” is what's going on in your city, not how goo you are at micro managing.  The graphics are great and large cities look amazing. I would love to be able to zoom in more and maybe follow a person around from their perspective, but what is there is really good. One bit that I found wasn't great was the lakes and rivers which (on some maps especially) when you zoom out far enough looked kinda like someone used a pain tool to draw them on the map. The solution, of course, is to not zoom out too far.  Once you get going on a city you do tend to loose yourself in the game, at least for the first 200 citizens. The whole “just one more turn” effect applies to this game (even though it's not turn based) until you reach larger sizes. It's easy to play the same way a good wine is easy to taste. (Who am I kidding, I'll drink any wine.)  The Bad  Banished is simple to learn and easy to play because it's an easy, simple game. Yes, you will have a challenge on your hands to figure out the secret to starting a successful city without losing settlers, but once you figure that out there's not much left. (I should note that I've never played anything except the hardest difficulty.) This is NOT Dwarf Fortress (complex and hard to play), but it is also not Sim City (complex but easy to play).  The list of challenges in the game include:  (1) Not dying that first year (or two). Once you figure out the trick this is no longer an issue. (2) Surviving minor disasters. People (and crops) die, get used to it...and plan for it. (3) Surviving major disasters. Few and far between in the games I've played, but having a large enough stock of everything seems to make this more of a hassle than a game-changer (with the notable exception of fires). (4) Build big and accomplish some challenges (things like population levels, # of buildings of certain type, etc). These are not in-game challenges and they don't have in-game rewards (that I've noticed), so there's not much point to them except to say you've done them.  The lack of challenges means that the game suffers in the replay-ability aspect and fails to hold attention beyond managing to create a large city (which is easy, just time consuming).  There is also a distinct lack of variety in the game. This can be seen in both the graphics (well done, just not many different homes, bridges, or wildlife as examples) and the basic resources (logs, stone, and iron metal – no different types of these things, that's it – oh, and coal which is all but useless). You can't plant trees along the paths or build a monument to yourself in the centre of town. The one exception is crops – there are many different types here which can be used to make a city look interesting (they are really not needed to survive, or even thrive, at all).  The lack of variety means that every city will look and feel about the same and there's no way to put your own signature on any given map. You will be able to mod the game eventually, but that seems like it's up to the players to make it a good game, which I have never bought into.  Final Thought  So, on one hand I *do* recommend the game because it's well done and for the first few tries you will have great fun (for me that was about 20 hours). On the other hand I *don't* recommend the game because there's just not enough there to justify the cost. However, if more features are added or if you see this game on sale...",

My Cons: I read that this was a simulator game, i was under the impression simulator means to show someone how to do something or hands on, ect. That is not the case here, you are given zero instruction, and you can't even control the people.  They do all the work, all you get to do is click the icons that you want to build, and you watch them build it. Thats it.  I was disappointed in reading how this was a building strategy game (one of the tags it has) yet there is no strategy involved, you can click an icon and the place you want it, thats the strategy.  Sure people die of starvation, but logic is to have food production.  That is not simulation, there is no 'hands on' type work that teach you how to survive or build. If i knew this beforehand, i wouldn't of bought it because i feel there is a false description wether it be by the tags on the game, or the description itself about the game, i don't feel it was accurate.  If i knew that your entire 'simulation' is clicking icons and places them on the grass was the main idea here, i would not of bought this. 4/10",

In the beginning I restarted the game a handful of times because I couldn't get my village to survive the first winter. Loved it! I'm a total sucker for rogue-like permadeath grinds where you have to start over again and again to optimize your approach. Well, that didn't last long. About 20 minutes in, I never faced defeat again, not even close. I stopped playing when I reached year 60 with a population of 104. By then I had long built everything there is to build. I always made sure to have an abundance of resources. Quite an easy task to be honest. All you need to survive and thrive (numbers based on 100 citizens): - 2 fishing docks --&gt; fish are the most failure-proof food source - some other food production like gatherers, orchards, crop fields - 2 forest lodges --&gt; logs for construction and firewood - 2 wood cutters --&gt; firewood to fuel houses - 1 mine - 1 quarry  Probably forgot something, but that's it really. Then simply build the literary handful of service buildings (like hospital) and enough housing lest you wind up with a retirement home and no fertile youngsters for breeding purposes.  I played the game mostly on 10x speed and it was still boring and slow as f***! After a couple of hours you've seen everything and you can deal with any disaster. Got some epidemic? No trouble, folks will automatically visit the hospital and get cured. Your cattle is infested? Slaughter them buggers and cut your losses. How would that be a problem when you have 6000 fish stored (which amazingly never rot, must be some Asian fermenting technique going on).  The game is boring because it's easy, lacks content and becomes repetitive after a mere few hours. There are some mods out there which add more content, but that only prolongs the inevitable. Still a good, almost bug-free indie-effort, no doubt. If you feel like getting it, wait for a sale!",

It offers a simple 'village builder,' where you can lay out your town as you please - no need to worry about setting up inefficient trade routes between islands (here's looking at you, Anno) or spamming area-of-effect buildings (SimCity) throughout the map. You build what's needed (a quarry to cut stone out of the ground after you've scavenged everything from the surface, for example), scale appropriately (farms to produce food as more families populate your town, for example), and you should be good-to-go.  Alas, it is not so. The AI - your townspeople - will ruin the experience of building a settlement for you.   Simply put, the moves your AI townfolk will make are terribly inefficient bordering on the outright nonsensical. Once your town seems to reach a certain threshold (greatly exacerbated in the 'mountains' style maps, where small pockets of population separated by terrain features dot the terrain), your workers will simply scramble in random patterns while resources go uncollected, buildings lay incomplete, and food goes to waste.  Don't count on workers to live near their place of employment - instead, count on workers to live in a random pattern, where they'll necessarily need to run all the way across town to get to work, only to find themselves exhausted at the end of the journey, turning around to get something to eat or warm up at the house - while the aforementioned projects lay idle. Your townspeople will, despite having plenty of food or resources stored for use, starve themselves for lack of time to collect and use those resources as they run clear across the expanse of whatever settlement they live in...   Unless you're extremely tedious in building housing immediately prior to putting a new production site down - something that's not feasible unless you're spending a ton of time deliberately planning every move versus 'going with the flow' of managing input/output as resources are built up or dwindle under the strain of new citizens - you'll simply watch your town(speople) self-destruct under the weight of the AI's ignorance. Not for lack of resources, mind you. Just that they're too stupid to locate closer to home, even if you intend for the queue to line up that way.

Pathing in the game is atrocious and often can leave your people starving due to poor prioritization of tasks by the AI. Characters pace back and forth in an endless loop in many cases.  All this game needed was a bit of flare. It could've adopted some flavor like Dwarf Fortress and made craft goods with a bit of personal touch by the artisan, or added some personality to the characters, or added some kind of replayability at all. The only thing you find in a map is water, rock, iron, and wood. It leaves nothing to the imagination and frankly I got bored.",

There are so many ways to make the town sustainable that once you get even a basic grasp of the(simple) game it feels impossible to fail.  After ten hours I have built two completely different types of towns and at the end of both games, mind you there is no end you just get so bored of playing that map you stop playing.

A city-building and resource management game reminiscent of Dwarf Fortress with a pretty GUI and a heavy antibacterial wipedown, Banished puts you in charge of a band of serfs, throws you into the wilderness, and tasks you with gathering resources from the environment in order to build a functioning settlement. Wood, stone, and iron are necessary for building structures. Tools and education keep your peons productive, food and clothing and shelter keep them healthy, and liquor, church, and corpse disposal keep them sane. Provide all of the above and your population will grow into a happy, healthy ant farm.  The problems lie in how basic and generic the game is. There are only a couple dozen structures to build, and with no options or upgrades for any of them, there's very little strategy to it; simply build everything as you can afford it, and make sure it's all densely packed with easy road access and ample wells around in case a fire breaks out. The environment consists of water, ground, and mountain tiles, with no unique resources or features to break up the monotony. Your citizens have no personalities, few unique traits, and cannot even be differentiated by skill - they can be Educated or Uneducated (which provides a slight penalty to all job performances), and everyone wields the same omnitools for all jobs. If the game provided the player with some concrete goals to aspire to, or made the world a bit more antagonizing, and made the losses from the few disasters it offers a bit more devastating, then maybe there'd be some fun here, but it's a pure sandbox game whose only goals are the Steam achievements, all of which involve playing for obscene amounts of time and stockpiling useless luxuries. It could be improved immensely with the addition of silly cosmetic buildings and structures, or some kind of lore or storyline to add flavor, but there's nothing of the sort.  I can appreciate what Shining Rock Software was trying to do here, but Banished just doesn't take any chances and isn't anywhere near being feature-ful enough to maintain interest. It's a nice demo, but let me know when you've got the rest of the game ready.",

Let me explain:  Tools are a  very  important resource in the game. Without them, your civilians  can't build things.   Naturally, when a tornado or a fire destroys your storage barn, you're going to have to rebuild it- right? Well, that's the thing- you can't. When your storage barn is destroyed, absolutely everything inside it is  apparently completely unsalvageable  also destroyed. It all disappears; food, tools- everything. Without tools, you can't rebuild another barn. Without a barn, you can't store food, without food, your civilians die in minutes, and that's it. Game over. I even tried building an  extra  storage barn on the other side of town, to spread my resources, but the game doesn't let you control what goes into your storage barns, so my civilians did not use my emergency storage barn, and it just sat there, empty.  You can store tools in your trading post, but- get this- the only way your civilians can access them is if they are moving the tools TO A STORAGE BARN! So the tools just sit there in crates, unused, even though you desperately need to use them.   There is literally nothing you can do to prevent even a perfect town from being completely wiped out within seconds by a spontaneous tornado, at any given moment. It's the most ridiculous, out-of-your-hands 'game-over' you'll ever experience. The random disasters should be there to set you back, not to break the game completely. I'm amazed that this could be overlooked by an otherwise very talented developer.  tl;dr: The game forces you to put all your eggs in one basket, and then stomps the ♥♥♥♥ out of the basket, and all you can do is watch, grief stricken. Otherwise, it's a great game. If they fixed this bug, then I'd give it 8/10, but until then, it's a 5/10.",

The game should be easy when played in the 'Easy' mode, but it isn't. The inevitable end for a large percentage of players is the entire population either starving or freezing to death.

            "review_text": "I have been a long-time lover of city-builders, and I was very excited to play Banished, but upon playing it... I found it very lacking.   My biggest problems are with the mechanics, which are the most important ones in a game like this. The whole premise is that you need to build a suitable village for a group of people who were ( assumably) banished. You start out with some basic food, tools and clothes, and then you are on your own.   The initial set-up is challenging. I had to do a lot of juggling with the jobs that my villagers occupied, because some jobs would stall or pause in certain seasons or without enough resources. This is not necessarily bad, but with the mechanics of Banished, this becomes a down-right nightmare. Say I have need of food, and I assign one of my miners to become a fisherman instead. Randomly, one of the miners will be chosen to fish - no matter the location of his house. So this man will spend far too much time walking to his destination to work, and he is only effective when he works at the location I assigned him.   The food crisis is over, and I assign one of my fishermen to be a miner... And it is not the same man i had as a miner previously.  In the end, this means that nobody lives near their jobs, and that their effectivity is greatly reduced. With perfect play, this can all be prevented, but that brings me to the next point;   When you have everything settled...... there is nothing to do.  There is no king you need to keep happy, there are no politics of any kind. Buildings always have a direct function, and so they never take more than half a day to build, unless you do not have the materials. When everything was going well I found myself bored, but as soon as something got out of hand, there was almost no way to effectively turn it back around without massive losses.   There are tons of small aggravating things in this game; - If you build too many houses, the people will stop marrying and making babies, because each person occupying a house.  - If you stop building houses, you will get the problem that people will ALSO stop making babies, because there is no more room in their house for a child.  - Mines and quarries are so ineffective that they are downright useless, and the few stone/iron resources given on the map run out quickly -There is little to no character to the townspeople, and there is not even a line of text for them to show unhappiness with. They only have stars to show their happiness, which can be fixed by a church or a bar.  -Some buildings need to be in remote locations, but the people that work at them do not live in these buildings, forcing them to walk a far way and waste valuable working time.   I had very high hopes for this game, but compared to the citybuilders I was used to by the time I got this game, it was a big disappointment.   On a more positive note; the music and visuals are very enjoyable. When played casually on the easy difficulty, I found it a very good game to relax with, and it was satisfying to see the farmers harvest their crop.  I do not recommend it for people that were looking for a citybuilder like Ceasar 3 or Children of the NIle, but if you want to have a relaxing time building a small village with bland villagers, this game is good.

            "review_text": "This game starts out fun, and then it gets annoying. It is the little things that make this game unplayable. Mainly how people starve and freeze to death all the time.  When you think you are doing well on food, think again, because in a minute you will miraculously having starving citizens and have no idea why. I wish the game showed who wasn’t producing good and who is so you can focus on high yield food options. *People freeze because they are too stupid to occupy one house to stay warm. Everyone wants to sit in their own house having to heat a single house for one person instead of a few houses filled with a couple people. This should be reworked. Also the fact people go through coats in a few years. I have had the same coat for over 10 years and it is fine. People freeze outside too fast. *People are just stupid. They go far away to chop down a tree, then don't even bring back the materials with them.  They also have too many kids, especially when your adults are starving, they selfishly have kids to have more mouths to feed. There should be a Governor after you build the federal building to tell the people to stop having kids. Or you should be able to be given the option to kill off older people or kids to preserve the community as a whole. On the other hand when your people are in desperate need of kids, they seem to not produce. Again, the government would help force this.  *People are also too dumb to move into houses close to where they work. I know everyone wants their own house, but when things are tough, people need to move into houses close to work, even if they are occupied by others, for the greater picture. Also farmers need to learn to harvest their entire crop before dropping off harvested portions. My farmers end up harvesting 1/16th of their crop, then packing it up to go take it to the storage. Harvest the entire thing and let the Laborer do the picking up. The farmer can help after his whole field is done being harvested. This would prevent 1/2 of the field getting wasted to winter coming too soon when he is busy transporting the food.  This game sadly, is only playable on a level of fun when it is heavly modded. The way it is by itself becomes unplayable, and unfun very fast.",

Good game to paddle with for a few hours, and explore the buildings; but once the honeymoon wears off you'll find you will close it angrily and never open.  If you can't see where I am comming from with the AI, here's a few things that I found myself annoyed at: - Villagers dying of starvation whilst holding food - Villagers ignoring buildings that are not connected by land mass but only by bridge. - Animals walking through the rivers and wandering through mountains (Not really that annoying, just rings of poor code) - Villagers constantly using coal when there is a huge coal shortage and tool shortage. - Villagers spend most of their times walking around on unrelated tasks to their purpose. (Is not solved by better building placement beacause they seem to prefer certain buildings over proximity)   I could go on and on about the AI, but I've made my point. Mind you, this will only really affect you right at the start or 100 pop in, when said issues will certaintly starve off half your town until food supply can cope, and rinse and repeat. A city builder and manager is entirely focused on having a decent AI, and if it's not there: the entire game will suffer tremendously. ",
