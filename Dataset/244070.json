            "review_text": "Ace Patrol is a turn-based air combat game. If you've ever played a civilization game in your life you will instantly recognize the hex grid across which you direct your squadron. There are some really neat concepts here; each pilot has their own flight competencies which enable them to take increasingly more aggressive maneuvers. As you navigate the battlefield you must take into account all of the factors one normally would in a flight combat simulator. From the angle of attack and altitude all the way to the direction you’re currently banking, every aspect affects the options you have for your next turn. It’s a neat game, but I would love to see it brought back with more graphical polish and a more robust tutorial. During my time playing, everything felt very disjointed and fragmented. It’s not a bad little strategy game, but doesn't feel fully realized.",

            "review_text": "Sid Meier's Ace Patrol is a fun, although highly unrealistic at times, turn-based strategy game set during The Great War (aka World War I). How much you enjoy it, however, depends on several factors, all of which shall be discussed in this review.  The first thing many gamers on Steam will notice is that the graphics aren't particularly high-res and the options menu within the game is severely limited. You can't even set the game's resolution and as far as I can tell, there's no anti-aliasing at all.  The reason for this is because SMAP was originally an iOS title.  What's the difference between the iOS app and the PC game? The mobile game is free, but requires that you pay for additional content. The PC version demands payment up front, but there no additional fees, optional or otherwise. The iOS version also uses a touch-screen interface as well, while the PC uses the mouse.  The game's audio is quite nice, especially the sound effects. Whenever you move one of your planes you hear the associated propeller-driven engine noise. It even changes depending on damage or what maneuver you're attempting to pull off.   The music fits the game, although I turned it off. This wasn't because it was bad, but because I generally dislike background music in games.   Unfortunately, your pilots' voices (the few times they speak) are sometimes weird or just plain buggy. One of my German pilots had a voice that sounded like someone had slowed down an old tape recording. It was amusing, but somewhat creepy at the same time.  The gameplay is standard turn-based fare, with some RPG elements tossed in. While in combat, your planes move over a hex-based battlefield, and have to keep an eye on their location. If they pass over an enemy base, for instance, anti-aircraft guns will fire at them. Fly into the clouds and you'll have temporary cover.   Your position also determines when you can fire at the enemy and how much damage you can potentially do. Attacking an enemy from a higher altitude generally inflicts more damage on them, just as lining up shots while on their tail. Likewise, trying to attack an enemy while head-on or from a lower altitude does less damage and exposes you to return fire.  The RPG elements come into play by leveling up your pilots. They can gain rank and medals, including ace status. If you win missions and have less than 50% damage on any pilot, you gain a bonus that can be applied to any pilot. These bonuses improve weapons, flying, and armor.   After a certain number of kills, each pilot gains a callsign, which denotes a special ability, some of which are offensive and other defensive. Examples of offensive callsigns include 'Deadeye' (long-range attack and better accuracy) or 'Executioner' (potential to kill enemy during first attack) while some defensive callsigns are 'Lucky' (anti-aircraft guns do no damage to you) or 'Grease Monkey' (repairs plane faster).   Each airplane also has its own stats, which gauge its speed, maneuverability, climbing rate, diving rate and hit points. Some planes have extra features, like a rear gunner or a machine gun mounted on the top of aircraft itself. These features let you shoot behind or up above you, when normally you could only shoot straight ahead.   If one of your pilots is shot down behind enemy lines, he'll be captured and become a prisoner of war. All prisoners are automatically exchanged every Christmas, although its possible for a pilot to escape. If your pilot was shot down within friendly territory, he'll be sent to the hospital and have to heal up before flying again. Finishing the mission with a severely damaged plane also necessitates repairs, which temporarily removes your pilot from active duty.  At the beginning of this review, I also noted that SMAP is unrealistic at times. How so? Well, for starters, you can play as one of four nations when playing a new game: American, British, French, and German. The problem with this is the campaign always begins in 1916, one year before the United States entered the war.   In addition, there are active-duty female combat pilots, when there were none at this time (or at least, none officially part of those four nations' armed forces). No pilots ever die, either. They can be captured or wounded, but that's it.  Of a somewhat more minor nitpick in regards to realism, the ranking structure makes no sense at all, and fails to take into account each nation's differing ranks and language. I know this doesn't really make a difference in the game as rank is meaningless and imparts no benefits of any sort, but it's still annoying if you know better.  So... would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you really like turn-based strategy, and the military and history inaccuracies won't drive you up the wall.",

            "review_text": "Sid Meier's Ace Patrol is the first of two Ace Patrol games (the second being Pacific Skies), and is, to me at least, the better of the two games. To sum it up, Ace Patrol is a light strategy game where players control a 4 man squadron on the Western Front during the First World War. It's not a bad game, but it has it's quirks. Here's the details:   Graphics - The first thing players see, and what gives the biggest impression because of it. Graphically speaking, the game is either sort of cool or really ugly depending on your preference. A lot of people say the graphics look like a Android ported game, and, from what I understand, it's because it is an Android port. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the game is more about tatics and strategy than graphics. I think the cartoon esque graphics are fine, and they seem to fit the game, even if they are somewhat glitchy at times. Rating: 3/5   Gameplay - Gameplay is fairly good. I find myself having that one more turn addiction I get from other Sid games, although not to the same affect as I would from games like Civilization. Gameplay consists of cotrolling a squadron of up to four pilots in tatical air battles over the Western Front. The goal of each mission varies, with everything from balloon busting to escort duties being available. Squadron members can 'learn' new maneuvers, which makes them more effective in combat. The same happens with enemy squadrons, which means the game gets progressively more challenging over time. Unfortunately, this means if you haven't been able to upgrade a squadron member, he\\she becomes rather useless as they basically become cannon fodder. Overall though the replayability is fairly high, even if some missions are bit repetitive. Rating: 4/5    Sound/Music - As can be expected with a game like this, music is basically non-exsistent. There's some at the beginning and end of each mission, and some for the menu and that's it. What's there isn't bad, and music isn't really needed. Sound on the other hand is really good. There's sounds for everything. From machine gun fire to explosions, it all sounds pretty good. There are a few bugs where the sound gets garbled, but this can be overlooked as it doesn't happen often.  Rating: 4/5    Overall, the game is good as long as your willing to overlook a few glitches and to some extent, depending on your taste, ugly graphics. Gameplay is solid, and the game serves it purpose of being a light strategy game. If your looking for a more casual gameplay experience, are just looking for a decent WWI game, or just want to try one of Sid Meier's gaming experiments, I recommend it. If, however, your turned off by cartoony graphics or shallow gameplay, then I would skip it.  Overall rating: 6/10",

I watched a few videos on YouTube to see what it would look like. After looking up solutions for the issue I found out that while I can play games with far better graphics on my crappy hardware, this mobile port won't start whatever I do. For 5€ this game feels like a rip-off, but I got got it as part oh the Humble Sid Meier Bundle from a friend, so ... it's just another entry in my list of games I won't or can't play.",

            "review_text": "Delightful turn-based air combat. Every turn is an agonising choice as you choose between maneuvers. The game mechanic of trading altitude for speed and advanced maneuvers is breathtaking in its clarity, simplicity, and plausible authenticity.   The early days of air combat lead to a game of jousting and attack runs, both sides clawing for altitude and position, weaving in and out of clouds and flak zones, trying to line up a shot or trick the enemy into lining themselves up for another pilot's power dive kill shot. Taking to the air knowing you're facing a supremely skilled enemy Ace is a daunting prospect as he dances his bird across the sky, crossing your engagement lines in a lightning sprint and performing daring aerobatics to bring himself up into your squadron's six, but even the best pilot can find himself hard pressed if he lets himself get caught at low altitude, exhausted by constant high-gee flying.  It's a light, tight, satisfying game that shows its mobile roots on the surface but the underlying design shows an understanding of what makes a game work that dwarfs most AAA releases.",

AGAIN I REPEAT DON'T BE PUT OFF BECAUSE GAME IS A PORT FROM THE IPHONE!  Now that I have told you that, let me tell you why you need to get this game if you like taticle turb based strategy games such as Frozen Synapse where you attempt to get into the best situation possible so that you may obliterate your enemy, than this game is for you. Here are the basics. You control a squad of 4 WW1 airplanes. You do missions ranging from shoot down all enemy pilots to protect your recon plane. You must than issue orders to your pilots based on their abilites and manuvers to complete the mission. Use each of them to cover the other. Deal with altitude, cloud cover and evasion. In other words, the combat is deep and satisfying. Missions can take anywere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes depending on how you play and how risky or safe you play.   How much gameplay is there? I've played 3 hours so far, still British (which is the first nation you get to play as) and just started the 3rd level out of 5 (I believe) After that you get to pick the next nation you play as which has different mission types, locals and planes.   The graphics suit the game just fine, a bit cartoony but not over the top cartoony. The planes have nice modles as does the ground. But your not playing this game for the graphics, your playing this game for the combat. Again, think games like Frozen Synapse or Advanced Wars mixed with the Hex Based grid system of Civilization V mixed in with Altitude, upgradable manuvers, cloud cover and hours of fun and strategy.  The game never feels cheep when your plane is getting shot up. More than likely there was a way to forgo the situtation you are in, but you can undo turns, keep going and get your self out. Some missions only allow 1 pillot while others require all 4. But you have to manage your pilots. Each pilot has a different skill set of manuvers ranging from rolls, loops, ace moves and many more and even a special perk such as being able to shoot from farther away, copy all plane upgrades or escape from POW camps. So you have to look at the mission your going to do and pick the best pilot(s) for the job.  There's still so much that I didn't cover in this review because I havn't even touched the surface of this game. Am I filling this review full of BS and lies? No. This is all true and better than I can explain. Should you get this game? If you like deep tacticle strategy games, than yes.",
