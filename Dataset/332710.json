            "review_text": "1Quest is a turn-based game that frankly doesn't do the best with that idea. Some might say that turn-based games are too slow and need to be sped up, but 1Quest takes that idea in the wrong direction. One misclick can ruin an entire playthrough fairly easily. Controls are not very clear and while customization is insane, the lack of a tutorial left me confused, so confused that I doubt I got even 10% of what this game offers. But with the GUI and lack of a tutorial, I don't relaly want to find out more. Perhaps with the addition of a tutorial and a way to plan out moves better, I'll reconsider.",

            "review_text": "A simple rogue-like which may be appealing to the newcomers or tablet users.  Pros: + Simple rogue-like design  Cons: -Art design (Especially color palette is terrible; sometimes it is difficult to see monsters) -Lazy effort: Shallow, no deep gameplay. Procedural generation doesnt excite or adds to replay value due to bad and simplistic map design. -Too simple for a rogue-like -Sound effects are terrible (That kind of sound design havent been considered as acceptable even in C64 era).   Final verdict: Since its cheap, it may deliver some 2-3 fun hours to newcomers to the genre. Other than that, simply avoid it. There are far too many great rogue-like titles in the market. 2/10",

A few different classes, all very customizable, but you will have to take the time to figure out leveling to get the full experience. I'm still trying to get the hang of the overall feel of the game, but I do enjoy it, and it's cheap. I'd say if this is on sale definitely pick it up.",
