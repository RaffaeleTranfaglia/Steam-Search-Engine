The game features 5 stories, each per character and a final act that ends the game. Each character has a mayor flaw and fear which they have to conquer. Make sure to save frequently! I had the pleasure to replay 20 minutes of gameplay after i clicked the wrong option...  Oh and, what a WONDERFUL voice cast. I truely enjoyed every voice work done in the game, especially Benny, Ellen and Nimdok have a wonderful voice.",

            "review_text": "A dark, existential point and click re-imagining of one of the best short stories ever written. IHNMAIMS is a classic adventure game that is difficult and thought-provoking.  The game has aged well all things considered, game-play is standard fare of the genre. This game is in many ways a lot like the old Sierra adventures in that you can actually lose the game (die) and you should keep a pen and paper handy to write stuff down. The game lets you play each of the characters stories in whatever order you chose, which is a nice feature.   An excellent choice for the adventure game fan.  (I have played this before and re-bought it on Steam that's why I only have 5 mins on record)",

            "review_text": "English version  (polska wersja poniżej)   I have a difficult time writing about I Have No Mouth and I Must because of my personal attitude towards this game. While I consider “The Longest Journey” the paramount of an adventure experience and believe that everyone should at least try this game, in case of IHNMaIMS is more complicated since, clearly, it is not a game everyone can enjoy.   First off all, IHNMaIMS is kind of The Elder Scrolls of adventure gaming, and for more than one reason. Firstly, hardy any point and click adventure gives player such freedom of choices. Secondly, much less on a positive note, this is possibly the greatest bugfest in the history of adventure gaming. When deciding to play this game one has to be prepared to face game breaking bugs that will inspire either restarting one’s adventure or a ragequit. Still, while IHNMaIMS forums are choke-full of bug reports , I was lucky enough to finish at least three different versions of this game without any problems.  Secondly, people who prefer solid mechanics and comfortable gameplay may (and probably will) completely disdain this game. In IHNMaIMS everything seems to be secondary to narration. If you prefer story over anything else, then that is not an issue, but if you want to play comfortably know this: this game has a nasty habit of playing with the gamer. Not to spoil too much, it often may look like you have to do something bad to another character (kill is such a nasty word…) or a group of characters to gain a particular item or simply progress a story. And when you finish that chapter you discover that said item was completely useless. On the other hand, the character’s alignment / sanity is of great importance in this game, and it is affected all the time, exactly by this kind of choices.   Thirdly, it needs to be said that to fully appreciate this game, some basic knowledge of Freudian psychology is needed. Especially the ego, superego and id and the dream symbolism may come in handy.   So, what does this game give in return ? Probably the most emotionally engaging experience in the history of adventure gaming. The world (or worlds) within this game is rich and congruent, storylines are brilliant and characters are captivating ( The game goes to great lengths to make one feel compassionate even for a sadistic scientist of a totalitarian regime). Also the way the puzzles fit into the storyline is truly brilliant. For example (not much of a spoiler, since that’s the very beginning of this particular chapter), the first day of the Benny’s storyline. Benny’s body has been completely mutilated during the years of merciless torture, his bones have been shattered and forced to grow together in a bad way, his vocal cords have been torn out and he is generally a mess. Consequently, first he has to learn how to eat, walk up the stairs and how to communicate with others.   Finally, for the game that’s nearly 20 years old, the graphics are still pretty impressive. The backgrounds are dark, moody and full of detail. Still, It should be appreciated how authors made almost every important item clearly visible.To conclude, let me just suggest running this game on ScummVM, a free tool that enables many graphic and sound options as well as some bugfixes – which in this particular game helps a lot.   Wersja Polska  Pisanie o I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream (dalej IHNMaIMS) przychodzi mi z trudem ze względu na fakt że jest to jedna z tych gier które zdefiniowały moje podejście do przygodówek. Inaczej jednak, niż w przypadku „Najdłuższej Podróży”, która niezmiennie jest moim „numerem jeden” w świecie point and clicków, nie mogę IHNMaIMS polecić każdemu.   Po pierwsze, można powiedzieć że ta gra jest swoistym „Elder Scrollem” przygodówek, i to z więcej niż jednego powodu. Podobnie jak seria Bethesdy daje wolność wyboru niespotykaną u innych przedstawicieli danego gatunku. I podobnie jak „Scrollsy” jest aż po same brzegi napakowana bugami wszelkiej maści i kalibru. Odpalając IHNMaIMS trzeba być przygotowanym na błędy które mogą uniemożliwić jej ukończenie, zmusić do restartu całej historii, albo spowodować ragequit. Inna sprawa, że ukończyłem co najmniej trzy różne wersje tej gry, nie natrafiając na żadne poważniejsze bugi, więc da się też „zaliczyć” ją bezproblemowo.   Po drugie, ludzie ceniący sobie solidną mechanikę ułatwiającą rozgrywkę na każdym kroku prawdopodobnie znienawidzą tą grę. Jakie problemy można mieć z mechaniką w point and clicku? W IHNMaIMS wszystko jest drugoplanowe względem opowiadanej historii. Osoboy ceniącym sobie w grach przede wszystkim angażującą narrację nie będą miały z tym problemów, niemniej ta gra potrafi momentami być bardzo złośliwa. Zamierzenie. Żeby uniknąć spoilerów wspomnę tylko że nieraz może wydawać się że jedynym sposobem zdobycia jakiegoś przedmiotu czy popchnięcia historii na przód jest wyrządzenie mniejszego bądź większego zła któremuś z bohaterów pobocznych. Kiedy już gracz zdobędzie dany przedmiot, okazuje się że nie jest on do niczego przydatny, podczas gdy poczytalność bohatera –którą tracimy bądź zyskujemy, zależnie od dokonywanych decyzji – odgrywa kluczową rolę w opowiadanej historii.   Po trzecie, żeby w pełni docenić IHNMaIMS, przydaje się podstawowa znajomość psychologii Freudowskiej – ego, super ego, id, symbolika snów. Bez tego niektóre fragmenty gry mogą wydać się niezrozumiałe.   A co ta gra może dać w zamian? Prawdopodobnie najbardziej wciągający horror science-fiction w historii gier przygodowych. Świat (czy raczej światy) przedstawiony tutaj jest bogaty, mroczny i fascynujący, historia ciekawa, a postacie wielopoziomowe i wzbudzające sympatię (nawet sadystyczny doktor z obozu zagłady – bo i kimś takim przyjdzie nam grać) . Jeżeli zaś chodzi o zagadki które stawiane są przez graczem, uważam je za szczytowe osiągnięcie jeżeli chodzi o łączenie narracji z mechaniką rozgrywki. Przykładem niech będzie początek historii Bennego (nie jest to wielki spoiler – pierwsze 5 minut rozdziału). Benny jest uroczą postacią – jego kości zostały połamane i zrosły się w paskudny sposób, struny głosowe zostały wyrwane z jego gardła, twarz ma pociętą w drobną kratkę – ogólnie Benny nie jest okazem zdrowia. Oczywiście ma to wpływ na zadania przed jakimi staje – na początku musimy nauczyć go jak komunikować się bez używania głosu, jeść (!) i wchodzić po schodach (!!).   Mógłbym o tej grze napisać wiele więcej, ale kończy mi się miejsce więc słowo o oprawie: po prawie 20 latach grafika ciągle robi wrażenie. Tła są klimatyczne, pełne szczegółów i wspaniale kształtują mroczny obraz gry, budowany również przez klimatyczną muzykę. Warto wspomnieć że autorzy dokonali niemal cudu sprawiając że na tych pełnych detali tłach prawie każdy istotny dla fabuły przedmiot jest widoczny. Na koniec wspomnę jeszcze tylko że najlepiej uruchomić tą grę przez ScummVM, darmowe narzędzie udostępniające w starych przygodówkach wiele opcji graficznych, dźwiękowych i naprawiających wiele błędów – co w przypadku IHNMaIMS ma niebagatelne znaczenie.",

            "review_text": "Okay I love IHNMAIMS. The story was great, the scenarios had a wide rage of challenge to them, and over all the different scenery was great. I do have a few criticisms of the game although...  The Save Game Glitch: When I was on my second scenario (I went Ellen then Gorrister) I kept one saved game because I didn't think I'd need another. The problem with that was I had to quit the game for a minute. When I went back to my saved game, Gorrister wasn't on screen. I could not advance through the story and I had to restart my game. The solution? Keep like a butt load of saved games on you I mean really save save save!!  Nimdok's Scenario: The story was fantastic but...it is EASY to advance through this scenario to the point of no return without specific items you will need. You have to do it a SPECIFIC way to advance in the story. The solution for this one is to read up on his story before hand or you definitely won't know what you're doing. I mean unless you are hardcore willing to go through the scenario a billion times I will reccomend you do this.  Endgame Strobe: During the endgame portion (no spoilers) at points the screen will start to flicker, possibly due to the graphics. This is easily remedied by going to another screen.   Otherwise the game is very playable, it's fun, and it's easy to get invested into the story. Just make sure to read up if you experience problems, there are others out there who have the solutions!",

            "review_text": "I can't properly describe the happy dance I did when IHNMAIMS got re-released on Steam a few months ago. As a young lad the demo of this bleak, creepy adventure game had haunted me, but never did I save enough allowance to buy the full game before it disappeared into the ether. Now, at last, I can revisit it and experience the horror for myself... and discover it's not all that horrifying, but it's still a fine adventure game.  Well, the premise is horrifying at least. The mad supercomputer AM has obliterated humanity, preserving only five individuals to torture for more than a hundred years. Now AM wants to play a special game with them, one that could result in their freedom, if they can overcome their fears and regrets. Each of the characters has some dark secret that AM has used to torture them; one was a Nazi doctor, another had his wife committed, and so on. You chose which scenario to play through, and if you die (yes, you can die in this adventure game, but it's only a temporary setback) you get to choose again. The gameplay is what you'd expect of an adventure game, though my impression is that this one is lighter on the item collecting and combining and more on interacting with the scenery and other characters. It can be a bit of a pixel hunt at times, and some of the puzzles are a little obtuse owing to the nightmarish nature of the scenarios AM concocts.  What really got me was the voice acting. I didn't even recall the game being voice acted when I was a child, and honestly the game is probably better served without it. The godlike supercomputer taunts his victims like a stuffy DOTA player ridiculing his team. The one woman of the group talks in some seriously dated 90s forced ebonics that gets pretty cringeworthy at times. The writing itself generally holds up, but there are occasional tonal shifts where a character tries to make a funny in the midst of confronting their horrors. Sadly, this one isn't quite as atmospheric and creepy as I had remembered, but it's a solid enough adventure game from what I've seen. And the world always needs more unique adventure games.",

This is frustrating and the fact there is a novel of this means I can without any guilt turn the game off and go read that instead.

            "review_text": "I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream is a bad game.  This 1995 point and click adventure, incredibly loosely based off Harlan Ellison's 1967 short story and co-designed by Ellison himself, shows its age and not in the usual way, though not in a way that marks it as the bad game it is. Those particular reasons are timeless.  Throughout the game, you're taken through five 'psychodramas', which you can choose at your own leisure and each centering around a particular character with their own sordid history full of metaphor and mental allegory reminiscent of Psychonaut's own Dreamworlds (though obviously, this game came first), and an end sequence. There are a variety of actions you can complete in each scenario that either lowers or raises each character's 'Spiritual Barometer', a basic morality system that, given the completely arbitrary and unsignposted actions that alter them, is thankfully nearly completely worthless on its own.   The art design is fantastic, with the intentionally ugly humanoid sprites laid thickly on richly detailed backgrounds that range from rusting iron plates to cerebral nightmarescapes, to one incredibly memorable locale that invokes the late H R Giger's biomechnical designs. The animation is negligible, which is more than acceptable given the time period the game was made in and the memory constraints developers had to work with, but does its job well enough.  Voice-acting and dialogue within I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream are executed very well, along with the noticeably good sound design in general, but have aged into campy and ridiculous conversations and reactions.   Playing as a tortured girl having a mental breakdown from confronting her [Hymen Highwayman] shouldn't be funny, but when the [Hymen Highwayman] in question is a Saturday-morning cartoon villain and the follow up is a sassy one-liner accompanied by a hilarious uppercut it's impossible to take seriously. This permeates the entire game. AM doesn't sound like a malevolent god going steadily crazy inside his suffocating shell, he sounds like the Joker phoning in his lines after a particularly strong hangover. The entire script has fermented into a vassal of ham and stifled laughter.   Only exceptions to this are Benny and Ted, the former who despite the massive overhaul to his character still comes across as a convincing racist military officer, and the latter whose entire storyline and character are just weak and forgettable. Despite the obviously unintentional retrospective of the narrative it's still enjoyable on its own.  None of the above remotely contributes to why I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream is a bad game. At worst it'll make you sad that, if you played it like my own playthrough ended up, you won't leave this game with the sense that you have truly managed to appreciate Ellison's narrative and tackling of themes that are usually not even whispered about in videogames, but with a steaming sense of frustration, regret that you ever bothered with the game, and a throbbing headache from having to replay the same sections over and over because you didn't managed to abuse save-states as much as they obviously expected you to.  'Unsignposted Dead Ends'. Innocuous actions which lock you into an unwinnable state, that the game does not notify you about or otherwise point out at all. You just wander around until your ever-decreasing cup of patience runs dry, trying to pick up another loose thread on the game's already obtuse and thoroughly unenjoyable puzzles, wondering if you're just missing a vital interaction or you have truly just screwed over your playthrough and you don't know how, when or why. One of the most hilarious examples had me complete an action that locked me into a dead state at the beginning of a scenario, but still let me get through almost entirety of of the scenario anyway, only locking out the last ten seconds of puzzle before the ending. It happened an average of once per scenario, each necessitating a complete restart if you've saved at the wrong moment.   Don't buy this game, folks, save your time, money, and the few non-aching brain cells you have left on something else. Anything else. It's not worth it.  And the game was designed like this on purpose. Someone sat down, and decided that assuming you had to pour water on the electronics a second time due to dialogue, or giving the pliers to the wrong starving victim at the wrong moment, was going to lock you out of completing the game and they weren't going to do a damn thing about it, not even update that otherwise useless hint book of theirs. Why?   I Have No Clue And I'm About To Scream.  EDIT: As ridiculous and insulting as [Hymen Highwayman] is, Steam censors the alternative so they get the ridiculous and insulting name for a sexual assaulter, and their filter can blow me.",

Maybe because I'm still not used to these kinds of games, but some puzzles require a lot of trial and error before you can be able to work something out.

Dear lord his voice acting is horrible. His German accent is the most cliche accent I have ever encountered. I could not take him seriously.  That small problem aside, the game comes from an era where game length was increased by mandatory replay. Each time you play a character through, you can make bad and good choices, but making bad choices will ultimately make you lose the game. And a choice you made 15 minutes earlier will irrevocably make the game unfinishable.   The game does a horrible job of giving you feedback. When you do something right, it will play a jingle that blends in easily to the games music. Maybe you will see something light up on the portrait. Otherwise, there are no other cues given.  I wanted to like this dark deep look at human nature, but like almost every game I've played from 10+ years ago, our nostalgia is overwriting our experience.  If you want the experience, just watch someone play it on youtube.",

It's also worth mentioning that Harlan Ellison's voicework is top notch!  However, I did have my gripes. The method in how you interact with things has not aged well. It can be very inconsistent. Sometimes the game wants me to 'use a door' other times it wants me to 'walk to' a door in order to proceed to the next area. Also, some items have you go on a bit of a pixel hunt. There were times when I had to use a guide. The item I needed was right under my nose, but the way it blended with the environment made it unclear.",

My only issue is the voice acting, and while I understand why Harlan Ellison would want to be AM, it takes me out of the moment.  I wish that someone would remake this game with time-neutral dialogue, newer voice acting and updated graphics. If remade, this game could become even more of a dark and meaningful masterpiece it already is. I enjoyed playing it, and would like newer generations to also enjoy it, but I feel that certain aspects of the game will turn off future audiences.  Which is too bad, because the story is amazing.

Each character's psyche and story is unique, and the mechanisms that lead you through each of their exploits, as well as the final chapter, serve to not only deepen the characteristics of each individual as well as the lore, but lets the player learn more about these inherent fears, and possibly even something about themselves.  While the mechanics are fairly basic as well as the hidden 'moral' system, it is still an enjoyable and interesting ride, especially considering the ability to have multiple endings. The point-and-click genre of games is fairly known for having obtuse puzzles every now and then, and this one is no expection, but taking into account that the ultimate 'good' ending in the game was suppose to virtually unreachable, it serves a purpose. The pixel graphics are still very well crafted, and the music and sound design are to be expected from this era.",

While most of the enigmas can be solved using the in-game hint system once you get a hang of it, it wouldn't hurt having a guide nearby just in case, especially if you are going for the 'good' ending. Some scenarios are way easier than others (Ted and Ellen are the easiest, Nimdok is average difficulty unless you want the good ending, and Benny and Gorrister are really hard. The ending is practically impossible without a guide, unless you're an adept of die and retry, harcore level).   Besides these technical questions, I have no mouth is a haunting, beautifully written and artistically flawless game like no other. There are different ways to finish each scenario, and I will get back to it after I have managed to shake the anguish that comes with playing and finishing the game for the first time.",
