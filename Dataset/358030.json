            "review_text": "*Note: CRT-style filter's 'curvature' and 'scanline' effects can be customized or turned off altogether. Don't let that keep you from getting the game.  Some key features of this game are:    Quirky, fast-paced battle system--turnbased, but fast-paced. Tactics will vary from your typical JRPG (a good thing).    Surprisingly interesting and different story from what I expected so far. Although the dialogue/characterization isn't top notch, it's decent. If I find a certain character annoying, it's probably because that character is just an annoying person, not because he/she is annoyingly portrayed.    Random encounters can be largely skipped while exploring; a huge boon, considering the nonlinear dungeons and secrets sprinkled throughout those as well as the world map itself.    Music is mostly catchy 8-bit style chiptunes reminiscent of (but higher quality than) Dragonquest and other NES-era games.    Fullscreen or windowed mode.    Customizeable controls, via editing a text file--easy, human readable format. Support for Numeric Keypad keys is forthcoming according to the developer but not yet enabled (8/5/2015).   The developer is involved in the community and personally helps with troubleshooting, takes suggestions, and generally seems a cool, likeable guy, too. =) A huge plus, for me.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who remembers and enjoys 8-bit or early 16-bit era RPGs. It has some modern quality of life features mixed in with oldschool aesthetics and some quirky twists on old mechanics.  It's not the biggest, baddest indie RPG on the block, but it's different, nostaligic, and just fun to play.",

            "review_text": "Classical JRPG with some improvements: - Annoying battles while you are exploring? Ignore most of them - Farming is boring? Adjust the difficulty and leveling-up speed  Secret places to explore and rewarding secondary missions. The story is the typical become-a-hero with some humour drops, but the focus is put into the clan rivalries.  Missing: - Translations - A map - AAA graphics   :P  ",

The writing is simple but entertaining. The gameplay pushes what it is in creative ways. I sat down to see if I wanted to stream it, and looked up an hour and a half later. When I did stream it, I accidentally marathoned it.   Secret areas galore, hidden sidequests, clever bosses. Possibly multiple ending sequences. in about 15-19 hours I think I probably only hit 70% of the content.   You can keep playing after you've beaten it and explore the world again, which I've yet to do as well.  ",
