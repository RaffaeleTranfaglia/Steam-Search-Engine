All the achievements are easily obtainable with the right amount of planning. It's fun to use trial and error to see what works when killing the serial killers. Had a lot of fun and can't wait for the next three episodes to be released! The easter egg achievement and alternate endings add good replayability. There will also be several lol moments when you fail miserably, but that is part of the fun!",

            "review_text": "This is a completely new review. My last one only told of my experience and nothing about the game mechanics. First off, you control 1 of 4 teenagers at any given time that can be cycled through at will. There are different ones in the 4 episodes that come with Lakeview Cabin Collection, although Cabin 6 is in beta currently, you can still play it. Each 'movie' is set in a different setting with (obviously) different characters and maniacal serial killers. Some of them even have multiple killers... I'm looking at you Cabin 4...  The game really builds a sense of dread as you take down the killer with one blast and you approach him to see if he's dead he'll inevitably pop up, bash you, take your weapon and murder you. From that, you'll be so shook up, while you may have 3 more characters to formulate a plan, they will likely all perish in a rather gory fashion until you wise up and search for more supplies hidden and use them to your advantage with your surroundings.   The game does not shy away from dark and gory subject matter either as a lot of my screenshots can attest. All in all, it keeps the surprises coming. It consistently will make you jump. You know the little pixellated killer may pop out or is just on the other side of the door, your heart rate won't care, it will climb. You will get panicked. Then you'll die and try again. It's a very fun game that has basic puzzles you uncover through exploration and using the tools at hand rather logically.   Sound also plays a major role. You may find certain items by listening when you throw something... is that a sock that sounds metallic when thrown? Must be something inside... Is the music ratcheting up when nearing a door? That psychopath may be ready to pounce out... just maybe...   It's impressive what a one-man team was able to produce on this. The level of detail for pixel graphics and the sound is impressive. Wind chimes blow in the breeze. There's a day/night cycle with some light weather effects. I couldn't recommend it more.",

The original archtypical horror tropes, the campy music and atmosphere... A harking back to the good old days of horror.  The game can't be described in a single word, it's fun, hilarious, challenging, addicting and even for being a 2D game, scared the crap out of me multiple times. It's truly a labor of love from the developer and it shows.  I bought this game for 7 dollars but would gladly have paid the 10+ for it.... it's worth every cent. Massive amounts of replay value. The solutions to all the games are very flexible... No two play throughs will be exactly the same. Plenty of hidden easter eggs as well, very cryptic puzzles and secrets. You'll definitely need a guide to finish these games but the fun is in learning the mechanics and testing different things out for yourself.  Highly recommended for any horror fan / horror game lover.",

            "review_text": "A Splendid Horror Homage   Lakeview Cabin makes me jump, but not in the cheap way so many other horror games seem to. It does it In the proper way, using atmosphere, timing and many of the tricks from the well-thumbed slasher film rulebook. The game uses sound and score superbly in this regard, the sudden cries of the crows seem filled with portent, the creak of a rafter, a door opening somewhere off screen. It all helps build the tension beautifully. The charm of the chunky sprites and backgrounds lend extra heft to the stabs of panic inducing action, too. The cute pixel characters offset nicely against the horrific situations.   For me, each episode of Lakeview gets better with every attempt. While the challenge of getting one character to the end of an episode without significant blood loss would probably not be enough to keep me playing, it is the detail in the design of each distinct episode and the individual stories that have me returning for more. All the episodes are challenging and amusing in their own macabre ways, each having more emphasis on certain of Lakeview's gameplay elements. If I had to pick a favourite it'd be the puzzle heavy Episode 5. The supernatural elements are clevery used and the suburban setting is perfect, right down to the kid brother's toy laser gun.  My only criticism is one that could possibly be chalked up to my own inferior grey matter. I simply cannot fathom what to do in episode 4. It's great fun to play but invariably I end up with every character reduced to a fine pixel paste within ten minutes and not the foggiest glimmer of a clue about how to progress on the next attempt. As far as I can tell the aim is simply to be suddenly butchered in the most amusing way possible.   As an homage to 70's and 80's horror and slasher films as well as classic adventure/puzzle games they don't come much better than this one. Looking forward to Episode 6!",

            "review_text": "The Lakeview Cabin Collection is a surivival horror action puzzle game for STEAM.   Before I talk about what I disliked about it, let me talk about what I enjoyed. It covers several genres of horror that I grew up with, from the killers, to the scenes and settings. The nostalgila factor alone already makes this game pretty good.   I like the art, it's retro, while still having it's own style and being able to separate itself from all the games that use the entire concept of retro art it's whole selling point.   The game also manages to be able to tell a story in a very basic manner without needing to have any sort of text. And I respect that. They did it in a much better way then Scott could ever hope to do with Five Nights At Freddies.   Now for the bad. To begin with, the controls are kind of wonky, it's going to take you awhile to get used to the very minimalistic controls they use. The game uses 'context senestive' icons to let you know when you can perform an action, but it isn't always clear what it is or what it's used for.   The hit detection in this game is terrible. 9 out of 10 times, an enemy will hit me before I even get remotely close to it, but the game, for whatever reason, seems to think I need to be right on top of an enemy to attack it. There's hard and then there's poor programming and this game could use a better combat system. At least give players the same attack reach the enemies do, that's only fair.  While the game advertises itself as a 'sandbox' game, the reality is, each 'feature' feels like the developers had a very specific idea on how the features should be solved. There's a lot of junk laying around, but a large majority of it simply doesn't feel useful in any sense.   It's kind of like Lemmings. The developers had a very specific idea on how every puzzle should be solved and while some people managed to avoid it, luck out and still win a stage, many others were left scratching their heads.  Finally, the puzzles in the game are simply atrocious. Many of them, you won't understand what's going on unless you watch or read some sort of guide. It suffers from the same 90's adventure point and click game issues, where nonsensical actions result in a reaction that helps you. From banging a lady on a bed to find a key, to pooping in a toilet to drop a stuffed bear, the end result is, what were they thinking?  Here's the thing, I appreciate the game and the concept of it. There's a lot of it I actually do like, but so much of it has made me so frustrated that I had to stop playing. The developers clearly workd hard on this product, but a lot of times the direction and mechanics feel really off.   At the time of writing this, I could have gotten a refund, but I decided not to. But unless you have a great mind of super obscure puzzles, unfair mechanics and bad hit detection, most of you would be better left off not buying this game. I suggest you play the FREE Lakeview Cabin game first, it's a java based game and will show you everything you need to see to decide to buy the game or not.",

Once the mystique of witnessing an uncensored drunken orgy get brutally interrupted by a neotenous, axe wielding psychopath wore off, I started to realize how terribly this game is designed.  But even design aside, I could forgive the needlessly convoluted item system, and I could forgive the wonky controls and questionable art style (even by pixel art standards). The real issue with this game is that it is presented as a 'sandbox' experience...but there's just not all that much to do. Think Scribblenauts, but without any kind of creative canvas at your disposal. You're basically just running around as long as you can, picking up rakes and turning wood chippers off and on...and throwing that red-headed, open-shirted man♥♥♥♥♥ into it for sleeping with your girlfriend....until the maniac comes to kill you.   And don't even bother with Lakeview Cabin IV. It is beyond monotenous. It's just a 'mouse-in-a-maze' type of situation. By the time I started mapping out a path through that slaughterhouse, I was very, very tired of playing already.  I can't really recommend it, honestly. Save that ten dollars and buy some delicious nuts and berries or something. I wish I could have.",

The 4 chapters start at 3 for some reason and each has their own team and theme. In Lakeview Chapter 3, it’s a bunch of spring break types vacationing at a cabin haunted by a murderous duo. Chapter 4 seems like a page pulled right out of The Hills Have Eyes with a little Texas Chainsaw massacre mixed in. Chapter 5 is a Jason-Freddy combination and Chapter 6 practically screams Alien. The content is all episodic and can be entered in any order you choose from the movie theater hub level.  Stages in LCC can be a bit cryptic as you start each one in somewhat peaceful conditions and it may seem as if there is nothing to do except wander around. This is an easy mistake to make as just about every stage has some sort of timer before various events are thrown into motion, potentially sealing your doom if you are not prepared enough. Each stage has a variety of weapons for you to fight back against the killers with, and careful use of combined forces is absolutely necessary if you want to be able to take them down.   If you plan on playing this game without a guide, expect to spend a lot of time doing trial and error before you finally figure things out. Some chapters are pretty obscure so don’t feel bad if you have to pull up a guide for help as there are plenty in the steam community. Either way, I managed to put in around 13 hours in Lakeview Cabin Collection which is a great deal for the price. Worth picking up if you’re into cheesy 80s horror movies and enjoy a good puzzle-mystery.  ",
