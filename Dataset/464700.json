However the optimization is downright awful, with FPS being between 10 - 20, when KF2 runs at 60 on high settings. I will recommend it because it's a short, free and very cute game, but the optimization needs to be fixed because choppy gameplay is not fun and instead makes the game frustating.",

            "review_text": "PROS: - Its beautiful, great if you want beautiful wallpaper for your computer - I love the stats grid mechanic - It runs at playable to fast framerates, even though I have a r9 380x and a FX-6300  CONS: - I wish the game was more clear and less linear since I skipped over the old mans dialogue and I didn't get past figuring out how to get a damn coconut - I would also like better music as I loved the hawaiian theme but the music seemed plain - I would also like a little more personality in the npc rather than a middle age women giving me inspirational quotes about weaving baskets - The dictionary thing that tells you hawaiian words and the 'press R to read about ' is a bit gimmicky - The storyline is a bit repetitive   OVERALL / tldr: Playing it felt much like windwaker but no where near a copy. Beside all it's flaws its a fun game and I would reccomend the game but I would have a guide next to it so you know what to do.  FPS: Min - 16 (During Beginning/Credits), Avg - 44, Max - 60 (fps capped at 60 but could probably faster)   EDIT: Thanks to the Guide I made it past the coconuts :P  Guide:        Achievement Guide &amp; Walkthrough&nbsp;",

THAT was a different story.. it's much harder than you'd think, but.. still quite enjoyable. easy to complete, and has a cute story. Overall though, Maui is a nice free game with a windwaker-esque feel that can be finished 100% in less than an hour.",

            "review_text": "Maui is a free game. It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played terrible. I guess the character you play is called Maui. Has a story from ancient Hawaiian lore and uses Hawaiian language. Has Steam achievements, some are easy.  Hard to figure out where your character is hitting in combat, combat is very bad. Enemies and friends look the same. Gameplay and cutscenes is very Laggy. Keyboard and mouse does not work completely, missing keys and is not in the Controls help, Requires and shows Xbox Controller in controls, but it does work with Saitek controller somewhat. The music is nice hawaiian music but there is No background music mute button, you will get tired of hearing the same clip of music. The camera control lets you view the void or object in the way. Has No graphics controls and No sound controls. No selector for choice of controls. Uses checkpoint system for saving.  Devs really need to make some changes.
