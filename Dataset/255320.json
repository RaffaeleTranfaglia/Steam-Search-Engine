            "review_text": "This game is a great throw back to the classic point and adventure games of the past. The artwork is great and fits the bizzare feel of the game and its colorful cast of insane characters. And the story is great from begining to end, though it does get very dark as it progresses, even with some genuenly shocking revelations. I had my guesses of what would happen but I was way off. If I had anything bad to say about the game, the controls point and click interface glitched every so often making me stuck on a puzzle because I am unable to click on an item that is clearly regestring in the game. Also, just like the p.o.c. games of yore, you may be stuck on a puzzle for a very long time til either revelation or gamefaq comes to you.",

Love it that no matter what weird combination tried, there was a remark for every one of them. Not just the standard: this does not seem to work.  I am currently replaying the game to get all achievements. And i really do not do that often. Actually , this is the first adventure game I replay.   On the downside, some solutions are a bit farfetched. I had to peek 2 times in walkthrough because I got stuck.  I seemed to have tried exactly what was the solution, but in a wrong stage of the game. That and in some cases lack of logic (at least for my brain) made it a hard game at times.   8/10",

I missed that extra sense of humor the sequel is constantly showing, and I had to patch it to continue, but it's worth it because it really is a little unknown jewel. The story is engaging and the characters are super lovable. Too bad after playing the sequel, E&amp;HTB's plot becomes so much more evident from the very beginning - so I very much recommend that, unlike me, you play them in the proper order! ;)",

Droggelbecher!  ++ lovely art style, especially Edna, her face is adorable ++ exciting and twisted story with a dark atmosphere ++ great sense of humor ++ unique, crazy/goofy characters and dialogues ++ some diffucult puzzles  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Meiner Meinung nach Daedalic Entertainments bestes Point &amp; Click Adventure, welches Geschichten aus einer psychartrischen Anstalt in einer solch überaus witzigen Art und Weise erzählt, dass sie einen leicht die Tatsache einen mental kranken Patienten zu spielen, vergessen lässt. Edna macht einen recht wirren, zerzausten und verlorenen Eindruck und eindeutig eine Macke, die zusammen mit ihren unterhaltsamen Reaktionen während der Lösung eines Puzzles und Untersuchung eines Items perfekt ins Spielgeschehen passt. Droggelbecher!  ++ schöner und passender Zeichenstil, ganz besonders Ednas liebenswertes Gesicht ++ spannende und verdrehte Story mit einer düsteren Atmosphäre ++ großartiger Humor ++ einzigartige, verrückte/alberne Charaktere und Dialoge ++ einige schwierige Puzzle",

            "review_text": "Not bad, but held back by its painful interface and UI. The game was conceived as a Masters Degree project for the lead developer and has since been distributed as an official release.  The game tries hard to be developed in the style of an older Adventure Game from the 90's. The interface is just as clunky and uncooperative, the inventory is just as much a pain to open and close, and it is just as hard to interact with objects as it was for one of those games from the early 90's. There are multiple ways to interact with objects and there is no easy way to pick and choose which one to use other than go through a clunky menu to find the interaction method or the object to use and then click on the object. It does discourage mouse-searching or throwing objects at each other until it works because you don't want to have to work the interface, but alas - this is one thing adopted from the early era of the genre which Daedalic did not yet smother in bed. I do appreciate how breaking down early adventure games with this release managed to give Daedalic the tools it needed to put together it's later games, but the mess you have to deal with in this game is just a pain.  The story follows Edna who begins the game in a padded cell because she is obviously crazy and her only companion is her stuffed rabbit who speaks to her. Her first task is to escape from the cell and go on to find out why you were locked up inside it in the first place. The story is well written, and I was interested in finding out what happened to Edna, what's going on at the asylum and meeting the other inmates. The dialogue is well written if a bit repetitive, especially if you are trying to find the answer to a dialogue puzzle, you may hear the same thing over and over again. The translation is quality work, with only a little germenglish disrupting things. I honestly didn't think too much of it and thought it a part of the asylum setting.  I have no complaint about the puzzles other than the repetitive dialogue I spoke of above. The difficulty ramps up gradually getting harder toward the end. You do have all the tools at your disposal but finding the solution or making attempts is hampered by the clunky and annoying to use interface.  At its core, this is a good game. It is held back by how far it tries to emulate early adventure games from the 90's. There is such a thing as being too retro where you not only duplicate what made these games successful and fun to play, but also annoying and difficult to use.",

Here we have a java background that loads the game. How many incompatibilities. And worst of all. It's NOT written in Java. It has a java layer running it. That means that the loading from place to place is slow.  Second Negative is the places. Ok. I like adventures. But my God. All the game except the end is in an asylum. I was freaked out. I wanted to see something different. The story to progress. Psychology.. You know!  Third negative are the incompatibilities that make the riddles NOT to be solved. The game stucks. Some people posted some solutions in the forums, don't remember some reviews too. But here we are playing . We have fun! Write the software for windows and Linux or Macs for Christ shake. You sell this thing.  The positives is that is a game with cartoon graphics and some story. It is also a great adventure , enough hardy for the hardcore gamers.  BUT with those negatives I can't recommend it. Sorry!",

However, there is a bug in both of the endings that you can choose if you choose to play in English, if you choose the Harvey ending, it will tell you what happened to the characters, and then finish the song, then loop 'Edna bricht aus' endlessly. Same with the other ending, but with just a blank screen, and music looping. However, this error does not happen if you play in German, with the credits rolling fine on both endings. Strange.",

But when I realized this is a 2011 game? Even for a university project, you'd think there'd be a few patches to make this a little more playable. The game kept freezing and crashing - you better be saving often lemme tell you, especially with some achievements; one of the puzzles glitches to impossibility unless you are playing in the original German; and no matter which ending you choose the credits get borked to the point of restarting. Buy it on the cheap for a few hours of good fun and a boost to your stats while having a few laughs along the way.",

Despite the cartoonish style, the ending sets Edna up as one of the most  believable  characters I've seen in a video game.  The ability to talk to all of your inventory items (and get a response) is a definite plus.  NOTE: If you play in English, there is a game stopping bug. Visit the community guide (  Fix for broken kitchen menu puzzle and both endings  ) for help and you're golden.",

            "review_text": "Update 2: Game ending/credits is currently bugged unless you put it in german. That means if you want the deja vu achievement, you need to have it in german till the credits are done.  Update: Originally I gave the game a thumb down, so the review has alot of negativeness to it. After I started using a walkthrough the game was alot more fun, because I could progress faster. It even made me have time to look at the achievements, and want to complete them all. Currently missing 4. The game is great, but it's so huge that the boring part was trying to find all the things to progress. My suggestion is to progress till you can't get further, and then just move over to a walkthrough. The game is worth completing!  The original review: First of I love point and click games and I have already finished 'Edna and Harvey: Harvey's new eyes', which I liked very much. To start of simple. This game is not even close to Harvey's new eyes.   To make a long story short, I think there are only a few things that makes me go thumb down instead of up: Graphically it looks much cheaper than the other game, which is weird because it came out AFTER the first game. It doesn't even have any way of changing the resolution. Keep in mind that this is not something I would give thumb down for. I often play old games, and it's never really a problem as long as I have fun....  And fun is the next problem. I like to complete games without a walkthrough, and sometimes it can be really timeconsuming, and requires a lot of patient. This game seems to be really confusing sometimes and very messy. I have played without walkthrough all the way, and it seems like I have unlocked most of the areas in the game at this point. The unlocked areas are now so wide, that I have problems with how I wanna spend my time. Sure I have some 'to do things', but it sure as hell ain't that easy to find!  So really. The game is great, buy it; especially if you don't care if you use a walkthrough or not (I might need one soon), but keep in mind that if you play it without it's gonna be really hard. It has been so far for me, but I'll give it a few more tries before using a walkthrough. And well that's one thing about this game. Search and you will find. My problem is really that it's really alot to search!",
