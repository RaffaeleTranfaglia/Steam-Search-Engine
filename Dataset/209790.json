            "review_text": "Splice is a puzzle game about manipulating genes; puzzles consist of moving individual cells into a predetermined pattern within a set number of moves. When first launched, the cells seem troublesome, erratic, and difficult to handle, but after a few sequences their patterns become obvious, allowing advanced assumptions and predictions to be made. While the puzzles start easy enough, the introduction of utility cells which can extend, duplicate, or destroy other cells slowly ramp up the difficulty. Later puzzles can be difficult, yet remain fair and can be overcome with enough thought and tenacity; this allows Splice to blissfully incorporate a nice balance of increasing difficulty without moving into the realm of the absurd or impossible.  Visually and audibly, Splice truly shines. Minimal graphics and a haunting soundtrack add a surreal quality to the puzzles. Even on the more difficult levels there is something soothing and beckoning about the looks and sounds being offered to the senses. For a puzzle game, it is difficult to imagine a style more inviting or enticing.  The only deterrents are those common to the genre; if you are not immediately struck by the puzzle type there will not be a sudden change in the gameplay. The puzzles are diverse and interesting, but never leave the general concept presented from the start. Length has also been mentioned as a negative, but with the epilogue, Splice totals just under 100 puzzles which seems more than reasonable. Other puzzle games have offered nearly limitless levels, but often those levels seem to sprout from random generation and not through individually, well thought out puzzles such as those found in Splice.

Cipher Prime continues to quietly make games that blur the line between  art  and  game . No other indie developer uses sound and music so well to evoke emotion and stir curiosity. Splice is a moving experience. I wholeheartedly recommend this thoughtful, compelling game.",

It's pretty simple - most of the early levels are a breeze, and even the more difficult ones don't take too long. The replayability of the game comes from 'angelic' levels, where it's possible to do it in fewer moves than it allows you - getting these levels in the minimum number of moves proves to be much more difficult.  It's fun, the music is relaxing, but you shouldn't expect it to take more than 2 or 3 hours. You should determine your appropriate price based off that.",

The initial puzzle groups are quite simple, but challenging puzzles emerge near the end of the game. The interface is minimalistic, but functional and visually appealing, and the soundscape is nice as well.   For Linux users  Steam Achievements and Steam Cloud are not implemented. The game runs through Wine, so you can attain achievements that way if you are so inclined.",

The relaxing and easy to listen to music make it even easier to get lost in the mind-flexing elegance of Splice. Successfully manipulating a strand or completing a sequence is often quite rewarding.  Splice is a well rounded and well made game. There is no aspect of the game that is really lacking, and at the same time there isn't anything that's unnecessary.

It really is hard to explain in words, but essentially you are splicing or splitting cells to make them form a specific pattern. Certain cells follow certain rules, so you need to think several steps ahead to make sure you are following the correct path - the fewer moves you use, the better. As the game progresses, more complexity and new rules are constantly added. In addition to being mind-bending and unique, it is also really pretty. And being pretty never hurts.",

            "review_text": "Splice is a very unique puzzle game. It's basically the concept of creating a specific binary tree with special nodes and moving smaller trees (splicing) to make a goal pattern/layout. This gameplay is very logic dependent and an intriguing concept, but the game doesn't provide much context to your input or any form of hints system. They do offer a sort of time reversal system and a simple undo, but some of the design decisions are questionable to me and this game could have benefited from a clearer input tutorial.   Things I really liked about Splice: the atmosphere of the game is pretty calm and soothing with a beautiful soundtrack and very ambient aesthetics; some of the angelic solutions (optimal moves to save as many splices as possible) are brilliantly designed; the concepts don't overstay their welcome too much with only 7 levels per sequence and the levels can be solved fairly quickly unless you get stumped.   Aspects that didn't click with me: minimal tutorial/context to input (a tool tip or two wouldn't hurt when a player gets stuck; just have a setting in the menu to enable/disable hints if they are purists); unfortunately a lot of the levels feel very similar to others and portions of the main sequence levels don't distinguish themselves particularly well; clearer menu system from the select screen to help identify potential angelic levels would be appreciated.   I got stuck for about 10-15 minutes on around 2 or 3 levels for the main sequences, but I didn't really care to plan my moves as I started to lose interest by that time [I was on the last series of levels]. The epilogue levels have some really neat puzzles and patterns they want you to understand, but it started to feel a lot like Computer Science work to me near the end and it might become too much pre planning with all the combinations for some folks.   Overall, Splice gets a Below Average Recommendation unless you're a Puzzle aficionado and for those people it would be an Above Average Recommendation. Splice is a neat experiment that can provide a cerebral evening or short bursts of puzzle solving split up into smaller segments over a few days. I'd just suggest keeping your Google-fu handy to get hints or some tools nearby to draw out the various combinations.",
