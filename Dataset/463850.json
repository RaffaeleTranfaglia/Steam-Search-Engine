Like, I don't say you should not buy it because of it, if you feel like just being silly for about an hour, then this game is for you. But after that you probably wont play it again, if it gets an update with a few more levels, then I think it would be worth the money, for now... not so much.   Still not a bad game though, just a bit expensive.",
