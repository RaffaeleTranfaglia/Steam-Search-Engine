The system in Vanishing Realms is far better which once you have something in your hand its your choice with the trigger to drop it. Also using the grip to say throw a spear make it easy to throw the controller as well.",

It's not too long right now, but it is fun. I enjoyed the magic mechanics, and the way the AI fight. The high quality motion capture animations the creator makes for a living come in handy with the golems and skeletons I've noticed. They move smoothly, and the AI itself counters attacks quite well. I look forward to more, and I hope other games learn from the combat in this one.",

            "review_text": "The following is basically my inner monologue while playing this game:  Okay. So I can pick up a sword and place it on my belt. Cool. Old fashioned guns? Neat! Oh hey, a bow and arrow with infinite supply of arrows! I can hold a fireball in my hand? I'm ready for anything! Oh hi zombies and skeletons. Yes, my bow is very overpowered. Uh oh, they're getting close. Time for my sword. Okay, forget the bow. I'll just keep a fireball ready and stab everything else. Fireballs are overpowered. I'll keep one in each hand and use the sword if I have to. Oh crap! They're trying to surround me! Swish with sword franticly and cast a fireball spell! Whew! That was close. Just a moment to rest.... what just hit me? AAAAAAAAAAAHHH! GIANT SPIDER!!!! WHERE'S MY SWORD?? And I'm poisoned and dead....   The following is my actual review: The movement supports both trackpad and teleporting for whatever your motion sickness tendencies require you to use (I used teleport but you can switch at will in the menu). For most games with swords and throwing mechanics, I'm always worried about my low ceilings. However in Spell Fighter, I didn't have any problem. Swords are effective no matter how you swing and fireballs are gaze guided. There's a nice training area you start at so you can get a handle on the weapons and spells before you're thrust into battle. I'd love to see more from this developer and more games in this style. I could easily see the next Skyrim being played like this. If you've got a Vive, you owe it to yourself to give this a play.   P.S. to the developer: Love the tiny raptor! Keep it in or give it its own project!",

            "review_text": "Pros: A fun fantasy title that goes to show that games like Skyrim and Mount &amp; Blade could be very successful in VR if executed properly. Combat is innovative and varied, with plenty of weapon combinations, whether you prefer using guns and spells at a distance or getting up close and personal with melee weapons. The game even has pad-based movement, which is an advantage over teleportation for those that prefer that sort of thing.  Cons: The inventory system is still quite glitchy. Weapons can occasionally just fall off of your slots and even disappear through the ground. The spell-casting system is intuitive and easy to learn, however the fact that you need to install third-party software in order to use voice-activated spells is a considerable drawback. Melee combat can also be a bit wonky at times, with your attacks occasionally passing through your enemies harmlessly.  Overall: Not a bad game. Definitely worth a look, and certain to give you a good idea of what sort of adventure games are possible on VR platforms.",

            "review_text": "Yes try it of course. Spell Fighter is free and I'm grateful for that. It's not polished though. I'm worried mostly about the combat and movement which is most important in a game like this. For the movement, the trackpad speed up/slow down mechanic is atrocious, and it should never turn the player. Personally, I would implement a regular single speed d-pad movement mechanic, and let the player turn around. Forget teleportation in a large scale game like this, it becomes tedious and not fun. I didn't like holding the grip button, again the theme here is tedium. The guns reloaded too slowly and got me killed. I think changing just these things would make the game better. Others please chime in. I liked the bow and the sword very much and it's great to see a larger open world game like this in VR. I want more, but I want better mechanics.",

            "review_text": "Great experiment of how to make a Skyrim-style game in VR.  This is definitely an experimentation on how an Elder Scrolls-esque game could work in virtual reality. Because of that caveat, it has faults. The largest (to me) is losing items on the ground. You're basically hovering a half-foot above the ground at all times, so if a weapon hits the dirt, you can't retrieve it. This leads to me usually spawning weapons on rocks or platforms so they're at chest-height for me. This is exasperated by having to hold the grip buttons at all times or losing your weapons. changing this to a toggle would solve that for the most part.  The movement will almost immediately cause nausea so switch over to the teleporting mode. DON'T BE A HERO! IT HURTS! The teleportation can cause issues if the walking figure gets stuck, but it's little more than a nuisance. I worked around it pretty quickly.  Overall, since this is free, it's a phenomonal look into the future of Western RPGs in VR. Throwing fireballs is satisfying, and blocking skeletons' swords with your own feels cool, even though you can get through most fights by wiggling the remote like a goober. Ultimately, I found myself legitimately trying to sword fight just because it felt more rewarding.  It's hard to describe how intense the combat is in the moment. It truly feels like you're fighting for survival. And there are great dangerous scenarios you can stumble into that makes the world feel bigger than it really is. One house in particular left me feeling like I'd made a horrible mistake in exploring it. But that experience was profound.  Overall, it's cool enough to give a try. After all, it's free!!!",

The swordplay is really fun and the animations of the enemies is very realistic. I felt like a true knight. I didn't use the spells except to heal myself after fighting. The voice controls didn't seem to do anything.   I agree with some of the other posters about the spiders. They were terrifying. I tried shooting them, but my gun ran out of ammo or and one of them charged at me. Scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. They haven't seen the last of me though.   Thanks for making it free. I look forward to what this becomes.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic game. Haven't finished the current version yet, so I don't know how expansive it is, but I have gotten into the dungeon so have gotten a fair taste at how all the spells and weapons work. I have not yet tried downloading the Voice Attack so don't know how the voice commands compare to manual. Good atmosphere; the skeletons use a lot of footwork during swordplay so gives a more urgent feel to the combat. Guns are cool but not OP, as they provide limited shots or slow loading time. Spells are also cool but the casting speed and reset times prevent them from being OP as well.  I find tracking movement more effective than teleportation, simply to move around during swordplay, but the one thing that got me was the 'smooth' glide of movement. It actually gave me a bit of motion sickness, which I am not usually sensitive to. I feel like a more natural 'head-bobbing' feel as is native in Unity would be helpful.  One other problem I had was grabbing my long gun while going for my sword. I think the 'box' for grabbing the gun might need to be shaven down to not include the barrel, as I didn't encounter this problem while carrying the handgun.",

My only disappointment with this and other trackpad games is that I find the movement to be absolute cancer and that's why I can't wait to try and get either the Cyberith or Omni to takeover that role away from the trackpad.",

I'll be keen to play updates as they come out.   1. It uses a modified version of teleportation where you teleport to an AI version of yourself that tries to walk to your target, this feels weird, as you don't jump to where your focus is. 2. Having to hold the grip to keep your weapon in hand is awkward, the grips on Vive are not great, and although it's hilarious to drop your sword in battle, it gets annoying after a few times. 3. Audio isn't spatialised, can't tell where and how far away baddies are. This is a big deal, get some 3Dception in on it. 4. Spiders need more audio. They siliently killed me, and felt unreal. 5. Controlling spells without the voice input is pretty rough. I should try it with that enabled.  ",

A regular teleport would work fine. ・ The weapons are limited and difficult to use. I picked up a spear, but it actually holds the spear where you grab it... ie, if you grab the pointy end, you just hold it by the pointy end. It should snap to a reasonable holding position. ・ The enemies were hard to find... I had to travel all around the village, then found a path out of town... at which point some skeletons finally came. ・ Combat is uninteresting... Because the weapons have no weight in your hand, you can just swipe 2-3 times a second, and kill stuff easy.  If you're desparate just to try something... I guess it's free. But don't expect much! Hopefully the devs keep improving on it, because I think melee combat would be fun in VR!",
