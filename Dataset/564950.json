    "description": "Starfighter Origins is a 90`s style space combat simulator inspired by games such as wing commander, Freespace and star wars. Combining a focus on single player action and favouring full space combat simulation over dog-fighting, Starfighter Origins looks and plays great using a Gamepad and also supports HOTAS.",
