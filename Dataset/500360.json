            "review_text": "EDIT: The developer got into contact with me after I posted this review and clarified that this game is actually more of a test than a set of fully working minigames. He also asked more about problems that I had, showing that he really cares about the game. I'm changing this review to positive, but know that the minigames are in a VERY rough shape at the moment, and that they exist more as concepts to try for a couple of minutes rather than games to play for any real length of time, which I do think could be made more clear on the store page. I'll leave my previous review below just for reference.   I didn't want to be 'that guy' that reviews a free game as being bad, but honestly, there's just nothing to this game. Ignoring future updates, there is zero reason for me to play it again, and that's after 19 minutes of playing (most of which were spent seeing how broken the archery mode was or trying to get teleporting to work).  First thing first, teleporting didn't work until I restarted the game... Not a good sign.  The goalie mode works. Three cannons shoot balls at your net, and you use giant hands on poles to protect your goal. Nothing wrong with it, it's just not particularly exciting.  The drone fighting mode might have potential. Currently, it feels like Space Pirate Trainer if it had been made by one person in a single day. The gun doesn't have sights, the sword bounces lasers in random directions, and the drones' flight patterns are just weird... I mean, it's playable, it's just not fun.  The archery mode... Wow. The bow kinda works, except that the arrow always looks fully drawn. The enemies can find you and walk towards you. You can teleport as much as you want, meaning that there is no reason for you to ever die. On top of that, I quickly found a spot up high to teleport to that made me invincible, completely breaking the (already quite broken) game... Oh, and a slight touch from your bow will instantly kill the enemies, meaning that there's really no meaning to even shooting them.  The biggest problem that plagued all three minigames was that there was NO haptic feedback. Literally every other Vive game I have ever played (including other freebies) has had haptic feedback. To block a goal, blast a drone, or shoot a bow with zero haptic feedback just feels so very wrong.  I get it. It's a free game that's possibly made by a single person. However, putting another obviously incomplete game on Steam is only hurting the Vive (I see people dissing the Vive all the time because all they see is shovelware). If this game was marked as early access, I'd wait to write my review. With it NOT being early access, though, I don't feel like I'm in the wrong for calling it out for what it is. Giving the game a positive review JUST for being free isn't helping anyone. I downloaded it after looking at the good ratings (which I realize all just basically say 'it's free!'), and I just feel lied to. Mark the game as early access or get it to a MUCH more playable state and I could see myself enjoying it and giving it a positive review.",

This is like an indie version of The Lab, so don't expect any depth... Just a few fun arcade-style games.  (Careful with the 'teleport', though. Hopefully he'll change it, but for now it could make you nauseous if you overuse it)",

They were easy to exploit, and the fact that the lobby is so barren is unfortunate. I think this should not have been released as is, and the creator should have waited to add more content instead of leaving all of the empty frames.",

Oh and then i teleported through a wall into the outside!! ****!.  I think its better to teleport using the fadeout mechanic - being 'thrown' across a big room is freaky!! I killed all the robots - they ran out sadly and I had to come out! - would love to see a big end of level boss! A 3d berserk?  Really nice work on the robots though - very satisfying to sweep the legs!  All in all...A great test bed of games! loving it!",
