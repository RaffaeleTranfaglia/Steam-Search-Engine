Is Heavy Weapon Deluxe really a screed about the division of self from society and how we are in truth a greater, unperceived whole, meaning our identity is beyond our control and indeed an artificial construct we bolt together piecemeal from the social experience of those with whom we identify?  Dammit, Sartre, stop making me think and just give me Peggle 2 already.",

The game also lacks any sense of appropriate resolution control and resembles the poorest of poor, half ♥♥♥ attempt of a port. Do not buy.",
