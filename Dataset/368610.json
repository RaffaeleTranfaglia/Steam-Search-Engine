            "review_text": "I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that the original Enchanted Cave is not only one of my favorite Flash games of all time, but one of my most-played games of all time.  I spent a good 50 hours or so with the original version on Kongregate and would come back to it periodically. When I saw that a sequel had not only been made, but had a Steam version too, it became one of the few times I've instabought a new release sight-unseen.  The Enchanted Cave 2 is very similar to its predecessor. You play as a rogue adventurer who journeys deep into a 100-level dungeon in search of loot, monsters and glory. Along the way, you find relics, potions and new items, and if things get too dangerous, you can always 'escape' with a pair of magical wings and try again with the gear you collected on the way. Combat is done automatically by just walking into enemies, and there's a semi-randomized aspect to the floors you visit - no two are the same.  It's pretty impressive what the creator, one-man dev studio Dustinaux, upgraded in the interim between games. Chief among the improvements is a massive skill tree system that has three distinct sectors. You can choose to upgrade physical skills (combat, defense, experience boosts and HP), magical skills (MP, new skills) or a general utility set (gold earned, potion efficiency). It actually gets quite challenging in later floors as you gain levels, because XP gains become minimal and you have to prioritize what you want to upgrade.  Instead of a simple splash screen in the original, there's now a town that you can visit in between runs, which has NPCs, shops and more. It even incentivizes the plot by making it possible to rescue NPCs trapped in the dungeon, who escape and become shopkeepers or bar patrons afterwards.  From a story standpoint, things haven't changed much. The story is pretty much exactly the same as before - there's an evil sorcerer who lives at the bottom of the dungeon and is trying his best to kill you, via subterfuge and the numerous enemies he summons on each level. The only difference now is that he isn't so blatant about his intentions, and you can find journal entries written by him in secret areas littered throughout the dungeon.  The one thing that makes the game so good is that it's addicting as hell. There's a definite sense of 'one more run', and you're constantly on the lookout for better gear, relics and potions. You can craft your own upgraded gear with special attributes, pick one of four character skins to use when raiding and try to fill out the 'Museum' (a place that houses all of your duplicate relics).  There are a couple problems of note as well. Despite the inclusion of Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong Country) as composer, the music is... underwhelming, considering his pedigree. Likewise, it can take hours to finish a run. Don't be deceived - there are enemies you physically can't pass without significant grinding.  That being said, the Enchanted Cave 2 is just as immersive and enjoyable as its predecessor. While it's not necessarily a true roguelike, it offers enough fun for anyone who's looking for an adventure with lots of variety and grinding. There's even a New Game Plus mode once you complete the dungeon for the first time.  Definitely check this one out.   For more reviews, visit my Curator page,  Alex's RPG Recommendations  !",

It uses up some good time when you just need to waste it. 7/10",

They will miss me if I play much more..   This game is brilliantly done, seriously. Well done! My only complaint is I'm not sure it explained game features that well, or maybe I skipped the tutorials? I never knew you could craft potions until I looked it up online. Also I really wished I had seen more quests before all the people dissappeared. I didn't know about that until late game, maybe you should have forced one on us, or forced a chat with a quest person. Also it's hard to tell what exactly the stats for weapons will do.  Anyways, other than that I had a great time. Would have bought it for $20-$30.  Btw it was kind of weird how the levels are layed out on the level chart (before you enter the cave). It's not even.. and skips a space after 50? What's with that?   ",

I decided I wanted to see how far I could get without grinding gems (after beating first run twice). I did grind first run through to fill museum. I ended up strong enough to beat the final boss without potions. After that, I went all the way to Newgame+7. I beat the boss in Newgame+7, but that's obviously the last one. He hit me for up to 5250 and I had 5390 hp. Took me 360 large mana pots to win. The only way I'd survive Newgame+8 boss is to grind gems. I made level 46 in Newgame+7, which is all skillpoints assigned, so there wasn't anything else to acheive really. Grinding for the sake of grinding just isnt' my cup of tea.  Still, was quite enjoyable and I feel I got my money's worth with 85.1 hours on record.",

However, there's something about charm and simplicity of this game that appeals to me. Even though I shouldn't like it, I do.  I have noticed as I try to 100% the achievements that grinding through the same levels over and over again to get items that just won't apper has gotten monotonous and frustrating. Luckily, the gameplay becomes mindless enough that I can listen to music or talk radio at the same time and still enjoy myself.",

There is a Flash version of it, but its just a 'lite' version with less floors and features overall. The gameplay is rather simple but still alot of fun, and it has a decent replayability value. The graphics are typical oldschool RPG-style and fit the game well.  For the low price its a VERY good choice to pick up, besides the amazing music by Grant frikken Kirkhope!",

Seriously you can replay the whole game with everything getting stronger, and stronger.  B) The price is a steal for how addictive it is. I played this game for over six hours strait when I first found it on Kongate. Only to turn around and loose my half way finished save due to a system failure. I went out and bought it right after that because this game is just FUN!  Now I'm going to admit to some people it could get repetitive, with each five or so levels having the same monsters that you need to kill to power up for stronger monsters. If you're not sure this is for you, then I'd suggest trying it for free elsewhere, and use that to make up your mind. I don't regret my purchase, and I spent way too many nights up too late playing this game.",
