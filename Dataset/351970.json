            "review_text": "This is a great game for JRPG fans. This is NOT good for casual gamers. If you're already familiar with the 'Tales of' series, you know exactly what you're getting into. For those of you who only know Tales of Symphonia, this game is very similar, with a very improved combat system, and a bit shorter. If you liked other entries in the series, you'll probably enjoy this one as well. It's a little bit more complicated than the others, though. If you like JRPGs and aren't familiar with Tales games, this is a good place to start.   Fun: 8.5/10   Gameplay: 9/10   Graphics: 10/10   Audio: 10/10   Replay Value:  There's a New Game+ option with extra difficulty modes and other options that you can change from one playthrough to another, so if you're a completionist, you might want to replay up to 3 or even 5 times. There's also a DLC chapter focusing on a minor character.  10/10    Let's get this out of the way first: Tales of Zestiria is a JRPG, but it does not have turn-based combat and is not a grindy game. In fact, your characters' levels matter much less than what equipment they use and how you control them in the real-time battles, both of which are based on some systems that are difficult to understand at first and brushed a lot of people the wrong way (see below for an overview). The lack of a need to grind, the presence of a good Quick Travel system and the lack of needlessly big, empty regions (except for one) mean that the game flows very well, and except for a single bit near the end which doesn't even take 15 minutes total to clear, it never feels like battles and simple puzzles are being tossed at you just to increase play time, as it often does with so many other games of the genre.  The game's localization was very well-done. One particular character has a thing for puns and 'dad jokes', which are very hard to localize because often they can't be translated and you have to come up with a new one along the same lines. The English versions of those might be one of my favorite parts of the game. The English voice acting is also very good for the most part. I don't know Japanese, so I can't compare, but the English language audio and text are on point.  The story is nothing exceptional, but good enough and well-told. The soundtrack is really good.The game world is immersive, there are interesting NPCs and sidequests, and I had fun just going out to explore places instead of actually following the story on several occasions. A big part of the game are the correlated Skills and Fusion systems, which I enjoyed playing around with, but which also frustrated many people. I'll get into those below.  There's an unofficial patch that allows the game to run at 60fps if you care about that sort of thing.   SPECIFICS  As I mentioned, character levels aren't as important in Tales of Zestiria as they are in the average JRPG. It's possible to take down an enemy twice your level or to be defeated by an enemy half your level, all depending on how you fight and on what equipment you have. Equipment stat boosts are much larger than your stat growth when you level up, but even more important than that are the Skills that your equipment comes with. Two otherwise identical weapons that happened to drop with different Skills on them can be significantly different from each other, depending on what other equipment you're wearing. In the beginning of the game, Skills aren't that important, but as the game progresses, they become more and more relevant. Certain bosses simply can't be beaten if you don't have the right Skills equipped.    THE BATTLE SYSTEM  When you encounter an enemy, a wide circular area will be closed around you to form the field of battle. You can move around freely,dodge, block, attack and defend in real time, and issue generic commands to the party members you're not controlling directly (spread out, focus on the same enemy, focus on attacking, focus on defense). By pausing the battle, you can enter a menu and order any non-controlled character to use a specific 'arte' (the game's name for attacks, special moves and magic). You can also change which character you control mid-battle. There are five elements (Void/Non-Elemental, Fire, Earth, Water and Wind) to which enemies can be weak, neutral or resistant. In addition, each element is associated to a status ailment (e.g. Water to Poison) and a character stat (e.g. Void to Attack). Every single arte you use will have one or more elements, and every arte of a given element has the potential to cause the respective element's status ailment or give you a buff to the corresponding stat when used. Enemies also have Types (e.g. Flying, Armored, Beast) against which certain attacks are strong. An attack that's strong against an enemy type will deal bonus damage even if that enemy is strong against the attack's element. There are three numbers to keep an eye on during battle: your HP, your SC (Spirit Chain) and your BG (Blast Gauge). BG is used for certain especially powerful artes and for a unique mechanic called Armatization. SC is what you use for actually fighting. Your maximum SC is always 100 and everything you do in battle except running and blocking costs some SC. SC recovers over time during the battle, but if you attack too quickly or too often, you'll run out and have to wait. The lower your SC goes, the slower it recovers.   SKILLS  Each character has five different equipment slots, and each piece of equipment has four Skill slots. There are a total of 50 different Skills that can give you anything from stat boosts to increased HP recovery, protection against an element or status ailment, added damage against certain enemies, etc. These Skills are organized into a 5x10 grid where each of the 5 lines corresponds to an element and each of the 10 collumns corresponds to a theme (e.g. the first collumn is stat boosts, the 9th collumn is increased damage of the respective types). Every Skill from currently equipped gear will be active on that character's Skill Chart.  Skills can be combined for added bonus effects, which can be even more dramatic than the basic Skills themselves (such as reflecting 30% of all damage of a particular element, having an extra Blast Gauge or gaining a 20% Max HP increase). The Bonus Skills depend on where skills are on the 5x10 Skills chart. There are three types of Bonus Skills: Stack (multiple copies of the same Skill), E-Union (two or more adjacent skills in the same horizontal line) and G-Union (all five Skills on the same collumn). Equipping two of the same skill, for instance, reduces the time you spend staggered by 6%. If you have multiple stacks of two, their effects add up - a stack of stacks, if you will. This means you can become completely immune to certain status ailments by equipping the right skills.   FUSION  Every piece of equipment you get will have at least one skill and up to four. In weapon shops, it's possible to fuse two pieces of equipment and combine their skills, while also improving the equipment's stats with each fusion. Slots that have the same skill in both fused weapons, or any skill in one weapon and a blank slot in the other will keep that same skill in the resulting fused weapon. Slots that are empty in both weapons will continue empty. Slots that have different skills in each weapon will end up with a third skill that is different from both. Because of this mechanism, through fusion you can create equipments with the Skill set you want, to match your play style or enable a specific strategy against a particular foe.   CONCLUSION  If the above description of game mechanics didn't scare you, and you enjoy JRPGs, you'll probably enjoy Tales of Zestiria. If not, then you've probably stopped reading already anyway, but don't buy the game. That is all.",

            "review_text": "This happens to be one of my favorite series of JRPG'S.   Pros: Graphics are nice.  Quick to work/patch peoples issues. Story is pretty indepth, side skits (little side conversations) are hilarious. Artes are decent Save points are plenty along with Quick Saves Music is fantastic Tutorial is explained Auto Mode is included, fantastic for grinding.  HUGE areas to explore. Achievements are there but not 'Killed your first mob! Good job!'  Cons Artes aren't as in depth as the other Tales games Some of the characters feel a bit off and impersonal for me, which ruins the atmosphere. Not selling the Soundtrack on steam (Yet) Taking out the JP song, issues or not, was still fantastic A bit confusing with all the added 'things' to fights. 'Auto' mode (fighting) is fantastic until it comes to a *boss* or *Main mob fight* and it's like it goes stupid.   Right now, I can in good faith recommend this game AT it's current price to someone whose interested. I am no where near finished and have spent a bunch of hours running around and checking every nook and cranny trying to find chests, herbs, ect. If you're new to the Tales series, it's a nice place to start. It IS different in degree of difficulty and direction then the others, but for a PC starter, it's perfect in difficulty, exploration and story. ",

            "review_text": "At nearly 12 hours into the game I have to wonder: am I playing the same game as everyone else?  The story thus far is miserable. 12 hours of play and I couldn't describe most characters to you. What do they want? What drives them? In Tales of Vesperia, within minutes of meeting of meeting the protagonist you understood his motivation and got to watch him and his friends grow over the next 40-odd hours. In Zestiria, I still couldn't tell you why the protagonist, Sorey, is even on his adventure. He seems to have shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Meh, let's save the world.' He's basically the character equivalent of plain, dry toast: inoffensive and uninteresting.   If characterization is paper thin, the plot is almost see-through. Most villains vanish, defeated, within minutes of meeting them. Schemers will tell you their entire plan at the drop of a hat. Whatever amorphous Big Bad lurks behind the scenes hasn't made so much as a single appearance. The party seems to bounce from area to area without any lead-in or world-building of any kind. I don't care about where we are or what we're doing because the game hasn't given me a reason to.  Yes, the combat system is messy, needlessly complicated, and arcane. And yes, the combat camera just loves to point at walls or the enemy's ankles. Honestly, I could live with that.  But I can't live with the fact that, after half a DAY of play, I don't care about these characters or this world.",

Haven't been a fan of the pay-gated costumes for some time now, but that offense is especially horrid in this one. It was bad in the xillia games too, but those games have a lot going for them. The combat is a step it the wrong direction entirely. It's slower than previous entries, and more restrictive as well. The fusion mechanic is poorly implemented, as you're much too weak without it, and much too powerful with it. Not only that, but it severly limits your combat options. This game is a horrible grind. levels mean very little, and instead you get stronger mostly via equipment and skills, which by itself is a good idea, I think. Unfortunately, it's another poorly implemented idea. Plot is worse than usual, even by tales fare, but at least the skits are pretty fun. Twists are easy to see for miles.  If you haven't played the other tales games, I recommend literally any of them that have come out since symphonia over this. Just skip it and hope Berseria is good.",

            "review_text": "Tales of Zestiria is almost passable if you enjoy Tales games. Awful if you just like RPGs. I am usually a fan of Tales games however Zestiria leaves much to be desired. It's actually the first in the series that I could not bring myself to complete.   The plot is cliche, none of the twists that you would expect out a Tales game were there at all. There are no betrayals, no surprises, no complex moral issues; and how could there be? Every single one of the characters is introduced as a flat anime cliche, and remains a flat anime cliche. The only interesting protagonist is unfortunately a temporary character.(mainly playable in paid DLC no less). The villains are equally as bad, there are less than half a dozen named villains I could even remember. The setting is rather bland and the world's lore works off corny premises that leave a lot to be desired.   The gameplay is where the game becomes truly cringeworthy. If you insist on playing this game, please play with a friend. (3 friends would be ideal, but for some reason this entry in the series only supports two players). The AI does not recognize the mechanics of the rock-paper-scissors system of gameplay, making it sometimes easier to simply set them to block and do nothing. The battle system has gotten rid of the aerial combat Tales of Xillia, and combat is now ground based.  Progression is also non-linear. Leveling up is essentially useless, skills and stats are strictly tied to equipment. This allows you to customize your characters strengths as you see fit, however it ends up taking a long time to assess whether a piece of equipment is an upgrade or if your shiny new sword will actually make you weaker. This ends up creating a long grind for the correct skills, and skill combos to maximize the strength of your characters.   Graphically this game is only a small improvement over the PS3 games. Even though Some settings are larger and more detailed than in past games. The game runs at 30fps, and is fairly optimized, but it seemed enemies on the map were sometimes rendered at an awkwardly lower rate for some reason.   Overall Tales of Zestiria takes far more steps back than it takes forward. Of the Tales Games I have played it has by far been my least favorite, as such I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the most die hard Tales Fans.",

This is also my first review so bear with me pls :P  Pros: +Good story. +Very good Animated scenes. +Character animations are really good. +Lots of Exploration and optional content. +Likeable main characters(Though they have cliche personalities.) +Your team's AI is good at supporting you. +Good humor(Both between character converstaions and item/monster descriptions.) +Wide range of enemy variations(apart from some of model and palette swaps), especially for equipments.) +Awesome and memorable soundtracks. +Attachments have physics. +Little fun skits for nearly everything.  Cons: -I said that AI is good at supporting you right? Well...thats the most that they can do. In fact they are so selfless, they don't even care about themselves most of the time which they often get KO'd and that is not really good when you want to achieve a good grade or win the battle. -The only bug?? I've encountered is that sometimes in game menus(like shops or equipment screen etc.) the confirm button doesn't work. -The skits that can be easily missed if you don't really know how to get them and there are lots of skits in the game. -The combat can be frustrating sometimes. One of the reasons is that most of the enemies move fast as you. When you are alone with horde of enemies and low at hp, you need to get away and heal yourself right?.....Oooh boy, good luck with that, since you will need it. -The ending of Alisha's DLC story....like wtf was that ending?? Even the achievement you get from it makes fun of the ending. It was a good troll 8/8.  Mixed: +/-The battle system is confusing and hard to keep up sometimes, but its not extremely hard. +/-The endboss was kinda lackluster but eh, I enjoyed it anyway and it was cool so I'm forgiving it.  Sooooooo......would I recommend playing this game?  Absolutely! As seen in it's screenshots and videos, the game is anime styled and if you are not really fond of animes and alike, this game might not be for you.

All-in-all it's a very good first port of a Tales series to PC. It follows the Tales formula of innocent youth facing a harsh world that was popularised in Tales of Symphonia and overcoming adversity with the power of friendship (though not Tales of Graces f 'FRIENDSHIP'). The characters are written very well and feel like they could be real people facing the struggles within the game.  Pros:   Constant frame rate in battle. There have been no dropped frames inside battles.   There is different AI patterns based off of difficulty. I noticed this when I was fighting a certain boss earlier in the game. His attack patterns were more stragetic in trying to stagger me instead of just trying to attack through my combos.   Humorous dialogue. A lot of the skits have been localised fairly well and feel like they keep the original tone.   Cons:   30 FPS lock. Before this review is obliterated by the dislike button hear me out. There's noticeable input lag when trying to do big combos during the game. There are times where a combo should have been fired off but it winds up not happening because the input was received on the wrong frame. It is jarring to have this happen repeatedly in a fight where you need to be able to stun-lock/combo-lock your opponent. I really do hope that Tales of Symphonia on PC is not just a direct port of the PS3 version which is similarly locked at 30 FPS.   Level pacing. This may just be me playing on Moderate/Hard on my first playthrough but there is a crushing level spike with every new area. Where most of the level spike can be off-put by mastering the dodge system and having a lot of Battle Skills active, the level spikes make it feel like grinding is the answer to a lot of the progression problems.

            "review_text": "POST-COMPLETION REVIEW: I had a lot of fun with the game, mainly the combat. The story was lackluster. Charactes were fun, although they didn't really grow as the story progressed. Compared to other Tales games it fell short. However, I'd still recommend this game. It's beautiful, once again combat was fun (despite the AI) with a good amount of skill customizations and abilities, and if you don't mind the generic story, it's a great game. I would not recommend paying full price for this game though. $54 is a bit excessive in my opinion. Definitely pick this up at $40 or less!  PRE-COMPLETION REVIEW: Enjoying the graphics and the combat. This is a great Tales game to pick up if you're new to the series as it's not too long or grindy (Compared to some of the other games, you will still drop lots of hours in to complete this game) the combos are really easy to string together. Lots of different difficulties. I found the normal mode to be too easy.  The characters are alright, I'm enjoying the full cast more than the full cast of Vesperia. The AI is pretty awful in boss fights, I generally have to tell them to defend while I solo the boss. The story is a little lacking as well, not as long or as 'compelling' as some of the other Tales game.  All in all though, this game is a fun time. There's lots of humour, lots of little side quests you can do. Combat flows pretty nicely. Good entry level Tales game, but keep in mind it's a long game compared to some others, and there's some stuff you'll have to learn when it comes to equipment and the 3 different types of 'artes' and what it effective against what.",

            "review_text": "So, Tales of Zestiria. First of all, I'll inform you that I'm a bit of a “Tales of” fan, but with them being scattered across various consoles, I've played only 3 of them before Zestiria: Symphonia, Abyss and Vesperia. Given the background, I'll make some comparisons, but I'll try to stick to the game to itself.  I'll start right away with my overall impression, then if you'll like you can read the details behind my opinion. Tales of Zestiria it's an okay game: it's fun, it has interesting characters, the music is awesome, the battle system is quick paced. However, it's a bit of roller-coaster, with highs and lows, hits and misses; some aspects of the game are too simple, while other are too complicate. I'll stick on a 7,5/10 as a numeric value. If you're a “Tales of” fan, prepare for many changes; if you never played a “Tales of” game, this is a really nice JRPG, that needs some work on some things. In both cases, it will be a good experience!  So, why 7,5? Let's find out  Zestiria is a JRPG, so it's the usual mix of exploration, puzzles and battles, which are in real time: you command directly one of the characters in the party, while the others are guided by the CPU, that follows a series of guidelines customizable by the player. It's basically an action game, quick paced, fast, fun and enjoyable. However, you can still coordinate the attacks of the whole party, giving specific commands if you want to take on the battles with a more strategic approach.  Now, the system has really changed from the previous “Tales of” games: you don't have a mana bar, but rather an action bar, that depletes when you attack or when you dodge, but it refills automatically if you defend or simply stand still. You don't have 'basic attacks' as in the other “Tales of” games, but rather different techniques (Artes) that you can use. Point is, the close combat Artes common to all the characters (the Martial Artes) are 'linear': you can do four attack in a combo before being forced to reset it, but the possibilities are very limited. At the first attack, you'll have to pick one of two specific Martial Artes, at the second one one of four specific Martial Artes and so on; at the second attack you can't pick a Martial Arte that triggers only at the fourth move. And it's a bit of a pain, since every enemy has weakness related to specific attacks. There are ways to break their resistance of course, you are playing with four characters after all so one of them will be able to strike hard the enemy when you can't. But aside from that, the combos you'll be able to create are impersonal and limited: back in Vesperia, it was GORGEUS to see the characters fighting... I made a 300+ hit combo in there! That was SO fun! Zestiria, however, becomes too repetitive too quickly. Of course, you have other types of melee attacks (the Occult Artes) and the classic long range magic attacks (the Seraphic Artes), so there are still possibilities, but still... This battle system feels like a bit of step backwards in order to make new things. They also added lots of battle rules and specific actions that are simply too many: it's nice to improve a fighting system by making it deeper, but I think they got too far. They also added a range of 50 skills bound to your equipments: from them, it comes most of the fighting power your characters will be able to acquire; you'll also be able to fuse equipments to either power up existing skills or making new ones. But even here, it's a bit too much: as I said, 50 skills. You really need a guide to understand how to get the desired result.  In short, they took many risks, some paid off, some didn't. It's still enjoyable, but it feels like they added too much to renovate the system.  The characters are enjoyable; we've seen better in the “Tales of” history, but we've seen worse. Overall, I liked them, some more than the others (Edna, Dezel, Zaveid), but I didn't actually dislike any of them. They're good, they work well. The plot is a bit traditional (chosen hero needs to defeat the big evil guy), but the characters interactions and developments make the story interesting and enjoyable. The game world feels a bit small, compared to other “Tales of”, and it needs more sidequests... But, credit where it's due, they gave you a hint system to tell you where you need to go to trigger the sidequest... In the past, you needed to be at the right place at the right time and they rarely gave you a hint about it.  The music is AWESOME, I really loved it, it pumps you up during the fights and it makes you feel the emotions of the characters.",

There are some minor issues like the game not using the dedicated GPU by default and VSync not working unless you enable it in your graphics card's control panel, but I can imagine those being patched in the near future.  The (in-combat) gameplay is fun, somewhat intuitive and depending on the dificulty settings quite challenging (duh). There are some details that I really like, like a 'have-I-talked-to-you-yet?' icon above NPCs and some about which I wonder why they are even in the game (the so called Treasure Detection triggers at like 3m distance to the chest. Nice.).  Can't say much about the story obviously, but from what I *have* seen so far it's a not too dark story as you'd find it in other JRPGs with spirits, apparently dragons and knight-princesses that wear rather, uhhm, unprotective armor. Well ok, it's not as bad as I made it sound, but it's still a JRPG.  The soundtrack is great, even the usual 'you're travelling around the world' music is great and doesn't get boring.  So I'd say give it a go if you're into this sort of stuff, and don't if you're not. I am though. Have a nice day :)  EDIT: The story just got a bit darker.",

PROS skippable cutscenes  orchestrated music  zaveid's theme  atmosphere and character art design  all swords and umbrellas have their own model assets, so you can watch the cutscenes to see them all    CONS  game has a butt backwards sense of progression: never in this game did i feel like i was getting stronger, rather i felt like the enemies were getting stronger and i had to grind, get better gear, or use cheese stunlock strats to keep up with the increasingly HP spongey enemies.  story is a real hit or miss  equipment fusions and bonus skills are too grindy  some side-quests are actually required for the main quest  objective markers are missing half of the time  battle camera glitches out when battle starts near collision models (walls)  friendly ai does not block, sidestep, nor use freerun to evade  friendly ai does not sidestep to reduce casting time for spells  friendly ai often gets you killed, ie: enemy is casting a spell and the friendly ai runs in and attacks with a hidden arte  weakness and resistance system is gimmicky form of 'strategy', as long as you can chain together multiple hits while the enemy is in hitstun/stunlock the game will give a weakened bonus  text tutorials. ffs this doesnt help explain anything while in real time combat.  combat and ai are framerate dependent. the game breaks if you try to unlimit the fps.  FINAL THOUGHTS  if a modding community comes back to adjust some of the combat and equipment mechanics, this game's lifespan and replayability will definitely increase.",

So far the game is really good. The music is really good, I've found some tracks I like a lot. But...I can't say this is my favorite Tales Of game, and from what I know, I don't think it will become it either. The battle system isn't as good as Hearts R or Graces F (Those are my two favorites of the series. Still really want to play Vesperia but haven't had the chance) and I'm not a fan of the human/seraphim difference.....but the biggest problem lies in how Alisha leaves the party (And early on to boot). This leaves the game giving you only 2 humans. That's not even enough to switch to someone else. Not to mention I don't really like Rose much.  The story is great but the gameplay seems kind of bland compared to others Tales games. In others, you must switch party members and do without people for a while....here....well you don't really have that except for the crucible locations. Also, for some reason, I just don't feel a desire to try playing the other characters in this game. Xillia 2 had Gaia that was fun to play as, and Xillia 1 and 2 both had Elise which could be fun if you get good at toggling Teepo. (I had an interest in Muzet but forgot why. I think it was a good balance and good aero combat character). Hearts R and Graces F both had a bunch of fun characters. But Zestiria, they don't really work so different from each other (At least as far as I know).  Hopefully the next 2 Tales Of games in development will turn out better. Please don't make this mistake again. I'm ok with a party member leaving, but give us enough different people to replace them with. Two humans just doesn't cut it. Still a great game but there are better Tales Of games out there for people getting into the series.  *Edit* I have now beat the game. I'd say it's the best game for 2015. But still not as good as Graces F or Hearts R but still great. Now I'm trying to find things to do post game outside of the DLC (I do have it though).",

The difficulty settings were really a step in the wrong direction, the harder the difficulty you select for the game,the less EXP you will earn,you will earn more gald but you will just spend more time farming enemies to get to a higher level, the only challenge this creates is whether or not you have the patience to keep playing the same things over. 3.

Much of this game consists of overly large areas with high ceilings, but said spaces feel empty when there's little but one or two enemies to occupy them. The cities look all too uniform, with no real distinguishing features to set them apart from one another, and this only gets worse inside building-dungeons, where the color schemes of the walls/floors/ceilings are so similar that you feel like falling asleep just looking at them.   The game is locked at 30FPS, and this doesn't have much effect on the game. However, there are times when it's quite noticable, like in the animations of distant enemies, as well as a close up few enemies with particularly fast animations (bats for instance). Minor graphical glitches are evident, but not more than you'd expect from a new release. Aside from that, it performs well. As an added bonus, the game supports resolution scaling tools like NVidia's DSR flawlessly.  That said, this game is a worthy successor to the 'Tales of...' series (as well as a solid JRPG, something Steam is short on), and while it isn't my favorite of the lot, I feel like my money was well spent here.

And in true JRPG fashion, don't sink too much love and grinding into the Aerith, because she leaves you at the end of disc 1.",

I dont know why the Tales Games are not as popular as the Final Fantasy series. The combat is as good as it gets in RPGs is incredibly fun, you can get by with button mashing, but for higher difficulties, you need to know what your doing.   The plot is your typical JRPG stuff, a good vs. evil, wtf are they talking about, etc. Characters and writing is very good. Edna made me laugh on multiple occations.  Keyboard controls are a little awkward but customizable enough to make it work. Control support is there and reccomended.   Its good, buy it, support it so more games like this will be released on PC.",

            "review_text": "Tales of Zestiria brings Bandai Namco's latest entry in its long line of fast-paced JRPGs to Western audiences, and notably for the first time to PC via Steam. It sports a cheery anime style and offers a meaty ability system for players to delve into, as JRPGs tend to do, capped off with the series' well-known (and trademarked) action-based combat.  The story follows a young man named Sorey, who has been raised away from humanity and early on in the story discovers he is their saviour - their 'Shepherd'. Along the way he meets entities representing the various natural elements and that he is able to fuse with ('armatize') in combat.  Combat is the defining feature of any Tales game, and Zestiria makes a few tweaks to the system such as battles no longer taking place in a separate arena. If there's a rock to your left when you encounter an enemy on the map, it'll be there during battle.  The rest of the combat system remains fairly intact - for the uninitiated, that includes chaining combos, a mix of physical and magical abilities, and an elemental strengths and weakness rock-paper-scissors system.  The fusion ability that Sorey unlocks early in the game is incredibly fun and powerful, but there are also genuine tactical reasons to not fuse. It's not like a Final Fantasy-style limit break that you just want to fire off as soon as it's ready, though doing so is rarely a truly terrible idea.  What really lets Zestiria down, though, is its equipment system. Each piece of equipment can come with up to four skills on it which represent a tile on a grid. Match the tiles either horizontally or vertically to enable bonus skills, and fuse matching pieces of gear together to create stronger gear with the skills you want... or in theory, that's how it works.  In practice, it actually restricts you - you make your way to the bottom of a dungeon, kill the boss and he drops an awesome weapon, but you can't use it because it doesn't have the right skills, breaking your horizontal or vertical lines, and equipping it is a net stat loss. It's a really unsatisfying feeling.  Zestiria sits in an odd spot within the market. For fans of the series, and JRPGs in general, it offers little in the way of surprise, and while enjoyable does come off a little trite. Gamers of this persuasion can probably pick up Zestiria with little fear of a poor experience, but shouldn't expect to be completely blown away.  Newcomers, however, are thrown head-first into the game's convoluted equipment and fusion systems. The game does offer the option to (further) simplify combat, but its true intention is to remove any necessity to correctly upgrade your equipment.  Outside this, enjoyment will come down to the individual's tolerance for Zestiria's anime influence in its appearance and in its story. If you're more of a cringer than a cheerer, then you may not want to follow this Shepherd.",

If you hate Tales games, why are you even reading the reviews?  I wasn't sure how well the Tales series would do on PC, and only pre-ordered because at the very least, it looked like ToS would be a bonus. After playing a few hours, I gotta say, I'm very pleased. The problems I saw in reviews on YouTube haven't appeared yet. The camera has been fine to me, the combat is pretty well balanced, and the controls are pretty good. A few buttons I'd pick better bindings for, but mostly just because I'm used to other games. I can't really think of much to complain about so far. The plot is cheesy as all Tales games are, with so much emphasis on friendship and working together for a better world etc., but I'd just be disoriented if it were any different. The tutorial at the beginning is kind of annoying, with all the times a window pops up or you need to try some certain thing in battle regardless of whether it's needed or not, but it doesn't repeat itself too much, and does make sure you learn the basics for the game before you jump in and get yourself confused and frustrated. A necessary evil, I guess. Overall, it's a Tales game, and a pretty fun one at that.",

Regarding the latter, I still dislike Mikleo's clothes and Soreys stupid ear feathers, but after our 70 hours together I love them far too much to care. I loved them enough after 2.   However, The game does seem have Lower Production values than Xillia. The Field environments are far better spatially designs than the blobs of land seen in Xillia, but in parts are very, for want of a better word, polygony. The town and dungeon areas dont seem as well designed as Xillia but they arent quite so polygony. Possibly because most of the dungeons are ruins which could be made from repeatable rectilinear assets which would reduce the work needed.   The battle system is a bit of a departure from previous games. The battle system has been gradually become more are more 3 dimensional in each installment, and using the battle ability 'Free and Free' completly removes the 2d axis you traditionally fight on. I didnt. The ability to fuse with the different seraphim characters in your Party is good to really mix up the playstyle, whether it's for defensive reasons, in order the withstand a bosses blows, or just for when you get surrounded by enemies weak to water and want to maelstrom them into oblivion. The camera is not great. It is what it is.   One thing that has come under fire is the abilities on a grid system. It is quite complicated. There are 50 abilities which all occupy a grid. Line up 2 or more horizontally you will get different elemental bonuses, or of you get all 5 in a collumn vertically you get a stat boost. For example for the first collumn grants you 10% boost on all stats. However I was fearful of losing this bonus after I had gotten it and as as a result by characters were wearing 1st and 2nd tier equipment far too late in the game for them to be doing so. I later opted for equiping all the strongest equipments for their various strengths and making small consessions for certain abilities to make up for a characters weaknesses or provide abilities beneficial for certain bosses. For example I equipped Sorey with 3 peices of equipment with the Lindwer ability, providing 45% more damage against dragons (15 each), and the bonus for stacking 3 was adding an extra unit to my blast gauge (blast gauge being expended for fusing and special attacks).  The Strong point in this game in the characters. They are so likeable. I didnt think anyone would replace Jude Mathis of Tales of Xillia at the top of my list of most likeble Tales Protagonists but Sorey may have done just that. Theres lots of skits that expand on the characters, and even the enemy information is full little tidbits of Lailahs puns, Edna's snark and insults directed at Mikleo, and Sorey being so enamored with the little gun carts the goblins ride that he wished to be the first Goblin Shepherd (all the while being lightly chastised by Mikleo). Theres something quite refreshing about opening the enemy info mid boss and have rose making a Joke. Theres also a fair amount of fun in the item descriptions as well (Soreys not allowed to touch Mikleos hair, not since the incident) and its these little touches that really make Tales of Zestiria.   Theres also a good soundtrack, a few pieces being outstanding, an overall improvement on previous games in the series.   If the question comes down to whether its better than Tales of Xillia then the answer is no, but that comparing an excellent JRPG with a very good one. If you have a PS3 play Xillia first. If you dont this is still worth your time and money.  I only meant to write a short few words to show support. Whoops.  And Meebo is my Precious Angel.",

The voice acting is hit or miss thus far, but is not distracting.  Combat is as you would expect from the free-motion system, and the customization of items and purifying of malevolence will add a new depth rather than just 'get to new town, buy new weapons' that it has often been in the past for Tales games.  The story is intriguing, and can be confusing if the player is not paying attention right from the start. Don't skip scenes early on, lest you not understand the core communication aspects Sorey has with Mikleo in comparison to someone like Alisha.

It's got a good range of resolution options, even going up to 1440p for my monitor. Preset graphics selections, FXAA support, draw distance, and a few other things to modify for graphics on top of that. It runs smoothly without any signs of stutters or crashing.  The biggest caveat for some would be the ugly textures in places and 30 FPS lock. However, I'm able to forgive them as it's a port of a PS3 game. Allowing higher than 30 FPS would have broken the combat system, according to the developers.   Still, hopefully with this game successful, they'll see PC as not a place to port, but as a primary release for future Tales games. And maybe those games will be designed around 60 FPS from the get go.  For the game itself, I can't judge. Only 30 minutes in. But so far, it seems to bring the standard Tales flavour, with its own unique charm. If you love Tales games, you'll love this game.  EDIT: After 3 hours of playing today, I've experienced a few graphical issues. Screen tearing and flickering happens extremely rarely, but it's noticeable when it does. However, this happaned maybe once an hour.   The battle camera can also be an issue: But only in the specific instance of battle starting while you're in a cramped area (like a doorway).   Still, these two problems are not nearly enough for me to not recommend it. In those 3 hours, most of my experience was good. The battle system is deep, and a good flow of tutorials and new mechanics means that it won't get stale for awhile - even once they stop I'll still have a lot to learn.",

If you're a fan of the tales series it seems to be more of the same. I expect the same tropes and new twists on some things.  The skits are a return to Tales of Graces with full character models instead of the usual boxed heads. The combat is focused more on the main protganist with the other characters able to enhance him better (without spoiling too much of the plot). It is an interesting mechanic. Xillia 2 locked Luger in place for the entire game (allowing you to play anyone but he had to stay in the party of four). In Zestiria while you can control any character you choose (just like most other tales series) it's in your best interest to stick with the main protagnist as you add more members to your crew. Additionally you have to have a human in control and there are other limiting factors to potential party make-up. I'm taking a 'wait-and-see' on how much this ends up bothering me.  I haven't had any issues with the PC port and have been using my PS3 controller with no issues. I also switched to the keyboard/mouse controls for a little bit and those worked fine as well. English voice acting is also well done.  The equipment/crafting portion of the game seems to be a bit more convoluted then it needs to be, but I think as time wanes on I'll figure out my way around it. Also the addition of being able to slot things into the zone (eventually this happens to avoid spoilers) that level up the monsters might give the player control to keep any zone relevant to your level.  I will say that the motley crew didn't start to round out really well (even skit wise) until Edna came along for me. So if you're finding the crew to be a bit dull or not your cup of tea... tough it out until her.  I look forward to losing more time to this game!",

Visuals are crisp, Japanese voice acting is solid, and although I am only 4-5 hours in, the stage is set and the story is beginning to build nicely.  Add to that a battle and ability system that has the potential for a large ammount of versatility and, thus far, this becomes a game that would belong in any collection, and an absolute staple of a JRPG one.   9/10 so far, with a point docked for some truly ridiculous skits in the DLC.

            "review_text": "Alright, so first of all, i will be comparing this to 'Tales of Vesperia (360 Version)' quite alot since thats the first Tales game i played and its known as one of the best tales games, So prepare to die, Eggbear!  Tales of Zestiria. Where to begin....  The story is pretty good, its a bit generic with the whole 'Chosen one' saving the world from 'Evil' concept, but overall it was quite good. The main character isn't as good as Yuri Lowell from Vesperia, but i still quite liked Sorey (I just hate how his name is pronounced, i expected it to be Sorei, its So-Ray..  Graphics were pretty good, the artstyle was nice, the animated cutscenes (not the ones that are In-Engine) were beautiful like they always are, i will say however, Vesperia's artstyle was a bit nicer, felt warmer, Cities had a distinct feel to them....   Gameplay includes lots of mashing buttons (Its best to not randomly mash tho, good to learn what all the skills do and when to use them so you can quickly mash out a 4 hit combo that the enemy is weak to) and also alot of talking to people or just watching a scene. I was surprised how much death was in this game compared to Vesperia, in Vesperia its implied that you do kill every monster and most humanoid enemies aswell, but you don't really see them die, get stabbed, cut or bleed, They would usually just fade away, where as in this game i did see alot more of that wich was a bit diffrent than what i was used to in a Tales game.  Game length: An average playthrough takes between 40-60 hours, can take more if you farm alot, I did most sidequests on my first playthrough, as far as i know i missed one or two, i also skipped the EX-Dungeon as i didn't wanna spend 5 hours at 6 AM running around with LV 70 Enemies.  Characters: The main characters and notable characters you encounter throughout the game are well designed, pretty well voiceacted (though Mikleo in the first 4th of the game is a bit hilarious) and they all have a good chemistry between eachother, i dont like the whole Alisha issue however and that did sour me a bit on the character on a whole.... so i made her wear a goofy moustache and large goofy glasses. -Main Character is pretty generic, he however loves archeology, so thats cool. -Mikleo (Meebo) is pretty simmilar to Sorey, but he's alot funnier as he gets annoyed easily -Pun-Master Lailah... She likes Puns... i dont... -Edna, Rita without any emotion, and lacks tidal wave spamming. -Dezel, obessed with revenge, has shark teeth (must be annoying to keep that sharp) -Zaveid, Exactly what i'd imagine a young Raven to act like. (I know Zaveid is not young, he looks young however) -Alisha, I WAS ROBBED OF MY SPEAR USER!!!!!! -Rose, You'd think a human with knives would be better than a Dog with a knife... she's not.   Combat: I am very used to the Vesperia system, where aslong as you learnt a very easy system, you could combo almost any move into another forever and just keep doing damage forever aslong as you had enough MP (MP? forgot what Vesperia used) aswell as the overlimit system. Zestiria's combat system is extremely annoying at first, it will take you some time to learn it, you get punished if you try to just mash random attacks, it wont work well unless you play on Simple.  Equipment System: So this section would normally not exist, its an RPG, it has items and stuff, what did you expect? Well..... Zestiria screws with equipment quite alot... In Vesperia, if you ever entered a new area there was a high chance that a new item you found was an instant upgrade or sidegrade, where as in Zestiria.... gear has its default stats... and randomised skills on the items, and an annoying system to combine skills.  If you're the kind of person that loves to read guides and look at spreadsheets and charts just to become the most powerful... you will love this system... I didnt, I would have liked the Vesperia system of 'This item is the best, its always the best' and not 'Hey... go farm 1000 items just to START making the ultimate weapon, then do it again for all your characters'  Conclusion: Zestiria is a great 50-70 hour game that can possibly turn into a 400 + hours game depending on how much farming and how many ng+'s you wanna do. .A game with great characters and artstyle (Its extremely anime styled, i mean Cmon... its a JRPG, what did you expect?) .Good Story .Good Controls (if you use a gamepad, have not tried keyboard yet) .One of those games able to give me shivers down my spine every time there's a cutscene (IN A POSITIVE WAY.....yeah... i know... I'm weird..) .30 FPS (60 with a mod, pretty easy to install, seems to update every 2 days or so, with an automatic update process)  Sadly the game had a lack of Rita Mordio, Edna was a somewhat acceptable substitute, but it's just not the same...  oh... and theres alot of puns... like alot... you might facepalm a few times... or audibly groan..",

Combat is complex (as in opposite for simple) but controls are complicated and poor; character empowerment is not dependent on levels or gold directly, but requires dedicated grinding for items; the plot aims to be serious but is too generic to be taken seriously; among the named, unique antagonists only the main Bad Guy gets *any* backstory (cmon, r u srs?); character development is weak; there are 'events of worldwide importance' all over yet nothing really changes and the whole world feels static. There are character costumes; but they get no love besides DLCs.

            "review_text": "Dear Bandai Namco Entertainment of Americaz,  This iz my sincere review of Talez of Zestiria for both PlayStation 4 and the Personal Computer. The first thing I would like to congratulate the developer teamz on, iz being able to deliverz a solid PC port of a Talez game. It haz great controlz, and graphical settingz (though it would've been nice if it had Fullscreen Borderless.) However, there are some thingz I would like to point outz that have given me some annoyance or troublez. The first of which being that the game has no minigamez, at allz. When I camez to Katz Korner, I was expecting at least one minigame or something, but I waz saddened to find nothingz. Gone are the dayz of being able to play Talez of DB on Talez of the Abyss, and limited to only listening to an epic cat songz, re-watching Skitz, Re-watching anime cutscenz and beating up a Toitlez for the good of making a point. This isn't the only issue I have thoughz, I'd like to point out that the game'z new equipment direction iz a bit strange, giving only HP on orbz obtainment, or via Sage, is a bit annoying, and making levelz practically meaningless iz even more so for casual playerz of the franchize.  Furthermorez, the game'z story is a bit lack-lusterz in comparison to prior talez gamez, and seemz to be slightly rushed. The game also copiez a lot of the story designz from a game known as Legend of Legaia, and I'll admit, I preferred that game more than this one. Even after all that, I did get a healthyz 45+ Hourz out of it on PS4 before pushing the game to itz limitz by forcing everyone'z statz to maximum on PC, this caused the game to be shortened to about 20 hourz or less, far less if you just skipz all the cutscenez. While I admitz, Talez of the Abyss is the longest Talez game title in the seriez, it would be nice if we got something on that scale again in the futurez. I really liked how Talez of the Abyss was able to make uz think there waz a final boss coming upz, but then it waz like 'Nopez, we liedz, this iz only aboutz 1/3 the gamez.' I hopez you will readz these wordz with utmost seriousness. While It lookz likez this iz a silly response, this iz a serious review of the gamez.  Sincerelyz, Ian Carlsonz Madisonz Wizconsinz, USA  P.S: Toitlez, Katz and Cowz for life. Alsoz, do considerz a more darkz talez in the futurez, one wherez the worldz is destroyedz like Final Fantasyz Six (Threez in Japanz.) Or Likez Wildz ARMz.  Oh alsoz, I only reccommendz this game if youz want to supportz the developmentz of more Talez gamez for PC. Otherwisez, get it on PlayStation 4.",

I haven't played any of the other tales games so I cannot compare them to each other but as a rpg itself i loved it. The characters were endearing and their personalities made sense and didn't feel forced. Some people may argue that Sorey may have been whiney and a goody two shoes but he stayed true to his character till the end which is to always to look for the good in people and will always try his best to avoid killing. All of the characters felt real and they had good interactions with each other if you were to watch all their side stories. Their actions were understandable and even the villians had a good reason for their actions which you may sympathize with.  If you played above the normal difficulty the gameplay could be a little tricky. Heck even normal can be hard sometimes but you'll get used to it in time. The grades for each battle with normal mobs was heavily dependent on time so if you want a good grade you have to kill them fast. The gameplay was also quite flexible and different types of combos and moves could be used to counter a certain type of enemy. Martial artes, hidden artes and seraphic artes had a type of rock paper scissors affinity which was cool. Armatization, where a human and a seraph becomes one, may seem quite op at first but you will come to realise that its not all powerful and sometimes its better not to armatize.  One thing i didn't like was that when the mobs detect you (and they probably always will unless you approach behind them with rose's silent step support action) they will chase you like hell and unless you have windstepping from your wind or water seraph, you won't be able to outrun them and you will engage in battle which is bad because your SC bar drops when you engange in battle. So resting in inns are actually quite frequent unless you saved some of your herbs.  If you love open world rpg you will love this.

There were some seemingly complex features and a lot of it I found unintuitive... I get the game has to teach them to the player but surely there are better ways than this immersion-breaking method.  In the short time I played I also found the dungeons and locations very static and uninteractive (and sometimes needlessly big and open). Walking through empty uninteractive room to empty uninteractive room with little to no interesting sights became quickly grinding on my experience.

            "review_text": "Tales of Zestiria is the first attempt at a full 3D combat system by the Tales series and it largely falls flat. The story is what you expect in a typical series, but there\\'s numerous problems with the game and you\\'d think that a company that has been making these types of RPGs for nearly 20 years would be learning from their mistakes. First and foremost are the controls. They haven\\'t been adopted to fit the 3D style. Holding down now often means holding back, and your character runs backwards when you try to use down + attack or down + arte. Another problem with the game is that you only have 2 human characters to use at a time. One human character can only be partnered up with one of the Seraphs, spirit like beings that only some people can see. The result is that even though you have four characters in your party, you can only use two. I also hope you don't get too attached to the heroine of the game because she gets replaced halfway through.  A serious issue I had with the game is the fact that Lailah is somehow bound to not speak about the past. The emphasis of learning your own answer through a journey is important, but the fact that she withholds crucial information throughout the game makes me feel like everyone is an idiot.  Another problem with the game is that the enemies have huge amounts of super armor and invincibility frames. Super armor is when the enemy breaks your combo and become immune to stun and knockbacks for a period of time. Invincibility is when they are immune to all damage while they are performing their attack. This occurs far too frequently in the game and many enemies activate it after a fixed number of hits, automatically ending your combo, even if they are airborne at the moment. Ironically, many of your character\\'s powered up transformations hit very rapidly and very quickly, allowing you to make high hit combos. The problem is that this automatically triggers the enemy\\'s auto response that makes them invincibile, largely making this feature useless.  There are some massive changes in this game compared to the other ones. Levels mean nothing in this game as it only gives you additional HP and the ability to equip more Skills (you can get more of those points from finding stupid monuments in the game than leveling up though). Stats are acquired from new equipment and killing bosses, not from leveling up. They also changed Grades and Skills to be unlocked by acquiring achievements. There are hints as to what you need to do to unlock them, but it quickly becomes something tedious. For the first time there is also no dedicated healer. Instead, everyone has a bunch of small heals, nothing that is meant for the entire party. Compared to the previous installments of Tales of Xillia and Tales of Xillia 2, this game has a worse story and worse gameplay.  The only good thing about buying this game was that I received Tales of Symphonia for free because I pre-ordered a terrible game. Hopefully Tales of Bestiria will improve on the combat and the story.",

The characters: I never really liked the lead in Tales games, they are mostly boring and pretty uninteresting, sometimes even unlikeable (I'm looking at you Luke) - Lloyd being the exception - but I don't mind Sorey to be honest. So that's something! The rest of the cast is interesting and the interaction is again really funny.  Graphic and sound stuff: Graphics are fine, but you can see, that this game was developed for the PS3, the music is in parts really damn good and never bad.  Gameplay: The gameplay/battles feel definetely a bit dumbed down from previous entries. It incorporates the weakness/power hit system from Zillia 2 and tries to bring a bit more depth into the game by introducing the armatizing feature (combining with a seraph character of the different elements), but it removes the freedom of binding martial artes to any button and the attacks have a specific spot in the combo. Like certain attacks are always the third in a combo and so on. I certainly miss the option to bind my 16 (or 20? has been a while) different attacks to every button I choose to and execute them whenever I want to, like in Zillia. Only hidden artes are bindable and very limited (5 can be bound at any given time), so overall not a lot of freedom there. Of course there's no cooking and no wonder chef... you have to buy food when you sleep in an inn.  The bad stuff: - Little variety in your party setup: it's always 2 humans and two seraphs, but as far as I've gotten now, you only have two humans at any given time, so you can only experiment with different seraphs in your setup (4 so far) - The camera... god damn this camera... especially in narrow hallways or near walls... - Countless tutorials but some stuff is still confusing. Like leveling your weapons, I've still don't really get it, mainly because I can't memorize the 50 different boni and there 'place' in the matrix... To really make a good item you need a tutorial or a reference sheet I guess - The game cheats... a lot. A lot of the time enemies are able to become invulnerable and stay invulnerable for easily half a minute or even more. While you are not able to stagger, damage or incapacitate they'll pound you down and this way you'll lose several battles or at least party member, which will instantly destroy your grade rank for the battle. It gets worse and worse as the story progresses. There were several battles against bosses where I was able to keep the whole party alive up until the boss decided to stay invulnerable for half a minute and kill my party... with maybe 1000 points of health left. There is NOTHING you can do ... just die and reload. -the party ai: they are stupid and will die a lot, which will cost you a lot of grades... a LOT.  Technical stuff: The game runs great, the 60 fps patch/mod really makes battle feel smoother and the game overall is really stable. I didn't have a single crash, so that's nice.",

            "review_text": "It is a jRPG , it is a Tales game.  Speaking as someone who had played almost every single Tales game out there from Phantasia ,Abyss, Rebirth , Destiny , Destiny 2 , Destiny remake ,Symphonia , Graces F , Legendia ...etc ( beside the Tales of dungeons and spin-offs ) ,it is hard for me to recommend this game to anyone , even to diehard Tales fans.  Zestiria does has a likable Artstyle and game graphics, dated but likable .especially if you are the sort who enjoy watching Anime and playing RPG ,which is why you are checking this game out .  The character dubs are decent and since the game came with dual languages on Steam, for those who like watching their Jap-dubbed anime with English subs , this should be familiar.  Comparing to the Playstation 3 version , the graphics in the game have also received a slight upgrades and the characters looks a lot sharper , the game environment and background is 'cleaner ' . It is however , still primarily a Playstation 3 game so don't expect anything you will see from the triple AAA games in 2015. One of the major complains from the fans is the game is still locked in its good old-fashion 30 Frame rate . It shouldn't be too notice-able unless you are a graphic and performance police , but even by the general standard in 2015 , a 60 fps solid port will make your fans much happier , Namco Bandai.  Additionally , there is a fan-made mod that seems to enable 60 fps but I have had occassional game crashes with that , so I wouldn't recommend installing it ( at least at the time of writing this review )  And what makes this Tales game special ? This is apparently the Tales team first effort go Open-world with Tales game , the world map are pretty large to explore and traveling from town to towns may take a while , with the occasionally interesting discovery . Despite of having a larger world map , most of the location are still somewhat boring and bland to look at .  The combat system itself is pretty fun , your typical Tales - smash N smash . Easy to play , hard to master . And great thing is this time you get to quick-switch among all your active party members in the combat , nobody is left behind.   So why wouldn't I recommend the game ?  Because the Game Story is a complete mess. And that is actually an understatement .  Not only the writing is a disaster , the presentation is boring , the game setting uninspiring , game characters also lack depth , almost making less sense than your local music channel. To be fair , the Tales team did attempt to grow out of the jRPG stereotypes and try new things . While the open world seamless combat transition works pretty well here , Bandai Namco had hired a proper writer , because many of the game aspects are not only getting old but becoming worse.   It's a jRPG , many may argue the recent jRPGs don't really has good story , but this one has probably one of the worst out there.   TL;DR : good port from the ps4 version , with pretty fun combat at first which eventually gets too complicated , grinding for high end equipment takes years , story doesn't make senses , plots a mess .",

Nothing you learn throughout the whole progression of the game changes anything that the main character does. It is a straightforward and linear narrative. Slowly learning the backstory of the previous Shepherd through memory fragments doesn't actually reward or change anything your party does. Also, the biggest story points almost always fall utterly flat. Speaking of linear, the same could be said for most of the dungeons. They are almost all comprised of long cooridors opening up to square rooms. The wide open spaces of the outside world also feel very barren. The Fusion mechanic also feels very much like a gimmick, but there were other issues with the combat as well. The camera can be unforgiving in its positioning, which makes the game feel very clunky at times.  If you go into this game expecting to find a dynamic cast of characters like Tales of the Abyss or Tales of Vesperia, I'm sorry to say that you will ultimately be disappointed.",

(Graces,Symphonia,Vesperia,XIllia and xillia 2) I found this game unsatisifying. (warning mechanic spoilers ahead. But no story spoilers)  Pros- Over 45 hours of gameplay garenteed.  Armisomething - It's a cool concept. But again. You get 2-4 ARTES. per armisilation. Yep. Your just using auto attacks or the same spell OVER. AND OVER AND OVER again.   I.. i can't honestly think of anything else    Cons Lack of artes. - In all other tales games you'd get an array of artes ( see rita mordio art exhibition on you tube) on this game however you get 7-11 artes each. This is EXTREMELY dispointing as it makes combat dull and repeative.  Uninteresting characters - Besides Edna who has a unique personality everyone is just plain and bland.  Lack of character development - Yeah. This is a big one. The characters do not develop. They litterally are like ' hey. Let's do this for no reason. Oh The world needs saving? better not give a back story' I cried in nearly every tales game. But i felt no emotional connectivity for this game. Considering it's a Rpg. 60% of the game became dead to me.  Mystic artes are a let down - The artes in this game are not flashy at all. Ranging from 1.3-4 seconds of animation. with little to pathetic damage. In most instances it's really not worth using it as to save your party from dieing.  Lack of devil arms - Yeah you heard me. No devil arms. Just some paper weaponry that has zero stats. Can't scale and you can only equip skills on it. ( which trust me, only means 10% increase on damage or so. really worth equipping a higher tier weapon)   Seperah - Yeah. The magical beings are a huge let down. They are litterally just humans. I don't know how characters can tell them apart. They don't have any physical features that let you know they are devine beings. Come on namco atleast give them elf ears or something!  In conclusion: If you played all the previous tales games go for it. it's going to be a long wait for the next game but please please please consider getting a previous titles. the gameplay is less grapical then xillia and less interesting then paint drying. sorry to say of course.",

The rest of the characters are not as intriguing as Alisha. Since I bought the game I will still try and finish it, but It is taking me forever because the characters are so boring and dull.  Game play is average.   The story is very simplistic.  Characters are boring (aside from Alisha).  I do however like the dialogue in the game.  TLDR:  My advice is to play the first hour of Zesteria, if you really like Alisha, return the game and never play it again. If you really like to play Sorey and Miklio, keep the game and play. Rose has to be the most boring heroine I have ever played lol...    EDIT:   I have to add a little more about why I am not recommending this game.   -I really feel that the characters are mediocre (not including Alisha) when you compare them to many good JRPG games. I am currently playing Tales of Symphonia and the characters are just 10x more beautiful which makes everything about the game 10x more entertaining.   -Sorey has to be one of the most unrelatable/boring heros i've seen in a long time... he has like no depth...  -Don't get me wrong, the graphics, art, music is very beautiful; visually it is a wonderful game. Content-wise it is a boring game. Battling enemies seems tedious and you almost have to combine to fight anyone (which makes it really reptitive).",

(Crache)  Cons: - The story is hard to play through because it's so bland and predictable.  (I feel like I'm gonna sleep for 3 days ohwowIsleptfor3dayswhathappened.)  - None of these characters that you meet or play have any depth to them.  (Except Sorey. He's got feathers for earrings wow.)  - Overworld design is so empty that it's depressing. (But don't worry because there's some completely not-out-of-place glowing Saffron next to this bush.)  - Monolith placement and their exceptional skill at awkwardly breaking the 4th wall.  (Ancient words of wisdom is to not buy this game.)  - The camera in combat is frustrating especially if you're in a dungeon hallway.  (Where am I)  - The equipment skill system is so unnecessary and cluttered.  (Difens -&gt; Defense)  - Combat is all about spamming your armament until you see 'Power Hit' appear.  (Up on the d-pad isn't the answer. Try left.)  - Post-combat dialogue is cringe-worthy.  (Purification Complete!)  - Trying to hit an enemy to start a pre-emptive attack is frustrating when your hitbox is at elbow length.  (SuperSneakyA+yeah)  - Every NPC has 1 of 2 designs. Brown/White shirt with Brown/White Pants. Or a Royal Knight.  (Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V)  - The name 'Shepherd'  (Seriously?)  Verdict: I would rather spend this money on cheese sticks.

Besides that though the game is thankfully voice narrated enough to the point that if you would rather skip the mundane yet still interesting side conversations the important things will still show up regardless.

You will love the Anime(ish) style of graphics - It isn't 'Real' like most games are going for now a days and that is great.  Controls are really easy to pick up both for Keyboard and Game pad (though I would recommend a Game-pad if you have one)  The characters are all different and the style in which you play does often relate to which ones you keep in battle.

            "review_text": "The short version:   Why to buy: It's a Tales of... game on PC. If you're a fan that alone is a good reason to support the release. It’s also a pretty solid port.  Feels like it is probably the best available version of the game -- my only regret is that I don't have a physical case to accompany the others in my collection. Has both Japanese and English options for audio!   Why to skip: Maybe not the best in the series.  The overall design is good but the battles are pretty meh due to how they are balanced. Way too much gear optimization/crafting for my tastes.   The nitty-gritty:   So, this could be overly negative in how it is presented. By the time I had reached the end of a 40 hour playthrough I was pretty tired of the mechanics and level design. However, it still takes strides forward that I appreciate, it’s just that the implementation probably could have been better.   At the start, everything was great.. The areas were large and beautifully presented. The battles seemed more or less on par with any other Tales game to date and everything was peachy. None of the characters outright seemed to be overly annoying or just plain oddly presented (thanks Graces F). The presentation or triggering for skits was a one of my favorite improvements - they now occur predictably at save points and Inns, making it relatively easy to know then to expect them. It takes the stress out of those ‘Oh crap did I just miss one’ moments that sometimes occur in other Tales games.   However, as my playtime increased, I noticed that the dungeons stopped presenting new twists. . Admittedly this is all a part of the fact that there are quite a few extra dungeons thrown in for good measure, but the overall quality seems to dip after a certain point. I should have just skipped what was unnecessary but a completionist bent made that difficult.    The combat system did not help with this either. The overall approach to combat feels like it’s been simplified to the point of being trivial. Magic does not have any actual cost - resulting in no items related to MP consumption even existing at all. Even in the heat of battle it only takes a moment of blocking in order to recharge to full, so there is no point to being stingy on the heaviest hitting moves you have.    This resulted in the next problem, that in order to avoid spending time grinding needlessly you I spent most of the later part of the game just running from Point A to Point B, dodging monsters the best I could through lengthy, repetitive environments. My enthusiasm then fizzed out, resulting in a need to just finish the game to be done with it. The overworld areas are fairly nice and all, but it seems like it could have benefited from a more condensed approach to the design, or less backtracking. This is somewhat managed by the teleportation mechanics but they tend to be finicky on how they function and will often bar you from using spots near to your objective (for scripting/trigger purposes I assume). Perhaps at some point they will get to a system that clicks better, but I’d almost rather they just go back to overworld maps at this point, as they tended to help create a better sense of scope and vastness to the world.   That all being said, I still don’t regret the purchase. It still holds a lot of the Tales characteristic charm and warmth via character interaction and development. They also spent a considerable amount of time investing in the villain's backstory - more than I think any other Tales games has before. While it still has an echo of the whole ‘Just cause,’ reasoning for ending the world, there is much more explanation into the ‘why’ of the villain's motives. Tropes still ensue in excess, it still feels far more well-rounded than I would normally expect.   Also, while I am bothered by many of the finer aspects of combat there are also still plenty of moments in which the system clicks and just feels good. It probably just suffers a bit from the scope of the game, resulting in the same problem I normally have with many open-world games - tons of content is great, but it can also be a pain when you have certain expectations regarding how extensive you want to be in searching every nook and cranny. I would recommend approaching Zestria as either taking your sweet time throughout the playthrough, or by letting yourself skip side-quests to avoid exhaustion.",

Now starting off I do have to comment that I've had to change the voice acting from English to Japanese as what they've done with the dialogue in the game left a sour taste in my mouth with the english voice acting. The voice actors are very good and I won't fault them, but Tales of Zestiria has changed the regular system from the old series favorite of having you page through dialogue bubbles, into making all story relevant things into cutscenes. Now while you can still progress through the text at your own speed by clicking the confirm button, I find that with the english voice acting there is an abudance of awkward spacing between lines that aren't in the japaense voice acting. As I said though, you can always fast forward through dialogue, so it's purely personal preference.  This game was ported in my opinion, BEAUTIFULLY, I have the game running on low settings due to some screen tearing at times, but it hardly takes away from the beauty of the game and the framerate in my personal opinion is fantastic.  The battle system has been enhanced wonderfully with a now near seamless transition from running around into battling in the very same area that you stopped in, say on the world map you get attacked by an enemy on a bridge, well then you're fighting right where you're standing with no break away from the map. Even with my computer occassionally chugging due to the large map on the world map, the game runs completely fine even with you battling in the same area and I've only seen lag from some of the flashier artes that your team uses.  Each of the characters are very endearing in my opinion, I personally had a distaste for Estele in Tales of Vesperia, but the main female lead for this game is fantastic and is very endearing to me as I can tell, unlike Estele, that she truly cares for other people and is willing to go out of her way for others. I thought at first that I would dislike the main character, Sorey, but he proved himself to be a fantastic character with a pretty good personality that stays happy go lucky even in some of the darker parts of the game.  I still have far to go in the game, but so far this game has proven itself to me to be a very enticing entry in the series with certain dialogue options that I'm still curious as to how they might affect things later on in the game. If you're a big fan of the Tales of series, I can personally recommend this one.",

            "review_text": " Gameplay - Battle System (6/10)     Heavily inspired by Tales of Graces' battle system except it is much more restrictive (much more restrictive compared to every Tales game, that was released after Vesperia) since everything is based on 4 hit combos whereas in, for example in Graces and Xillia you could chain combos as long as you had the AC/CC to do so.     The battle system heavily relies on exploiting the battle system's main point, Armatize.     Seraphim characters automatically switch out when they are incapitated in battle if they are partnered with a character you are not controlling and you cannot switch them back for a while, meaning you can't throw life bottles on them when that happens which is really annoying. Additionally some conditions will cause automatic Armatize whether you like it or not.    Glaringly obvious and consistent camera issues in battle throughout the entire game.    Removing shortcut keys (right analog stick on previous Tales games) for setting artes/ally artes is a straight downgrade from previous games, even Phantasia GBA had this.    Seraphim characters' arte pools had to suffer to make Armatize better. 7 offensive spells per Seraphim really?    No primary healer character, each Seraphim has 2 spells that are hybrid healing+buffing spells with EXTREMELY LONG cast times when you aren't using them at the end of the 4 hit combo. Meanwhile Armatize healing spells cost BG but have nearly instanaeous cast time and are very potent, again Seraphims had to suffer due to this battle system.    For certain battles where the boss has a high resistance to a certain element the Seraphim of that element is pretty much worthless. Lailah and Mikleo have a much heavier focus in their respective element compared to the other two Seraphim.    Forced party members. Firstly you must have two human characters in your party at all times (unless the other human who isn't Sorey has temporarily left the group) and Seraphim characters must pair up with each human. If the only human in your party is Sorey you are only allowed to bring 1 Seraphim with you in battle (2-man party) despite the entire Seraphim group being with you. Secondly almost every single story boss battle forces the battle to start with Mikleo and Lailah despite your initial party setup being otherwise, like... why the ♥♥♥♥.    A lot of battles will begin in narrow corridors making it very difficult to move around.    Gameplay - Outside of battle (5/10)     The equipment-skill system is unnecessarily complicated and simply impractical. The skills that come with equipment are very random and you will not be able to get the skill alignments you want unless you really min-max in the end game where it doesn't really matter anymore.    Titles in this game give large benefits when mastered but there are extremely few, part of the fun of previous Tales games was collecting titles...    Extremely little weapon variety and they don't even have menu artwork for them. Even the apple gels don't have artwork.    Fields are extremely large for...no reason at all. There's very few treasure chests in the corners of the map too. Yeah OK they look nice but hills of grass and trees gets boring after a while.    Story (7/10)     The story is a very straightforward collect x powers plot with very little twist or turns in it. Story progression is very linear (the map allows you to travel to different areas but the areas you aren't supposed to go to at whatever point of the story you're at are blocked off or filled with Malevalonce making battles pretty much impossible to win so you can't go that way either).    The story does a good job exploring what's right and what's wrong, what's black and white and staying in the grey zone most of the time.    World/story/sidequest issues either resolve themselves the moment they emerge, the party are simply not allowed to resolve the issue (because the plot point is that the Shepard cannot get involved with human issues...), or they just flat out ignore it and hope for the best (  Alisha gets held hostage at one point, the party initially act according to the villain's demands but then they just hope she makes it out OK after they finish their business without checking her status at all LOL?  )    Characters (8/10)   One thing Zestiria does well is the character interactions during cutscenes. Even during certain serious cutscene Lailah tries to crack a pun to ease the tension or Edna makes sarcastic remarks which is quite different from usual Tales games where cutscenes are mostly only serious or humourous. The most boring/unlikable characters in this game are nowhere near as unlikable as characters such as Asbel in Graces.     Sorey: Not a bad character but he's just very bland.    Mikleo: A bit less naive than Sorey but still very boring. Doesn't help that he has some character overlap with Sorey too (both ruin freaks, both the youngest physically+mentally in the party, both less knowledgable about the world than everyone else in the party)    Sorey + Mikleo honestly just feel like one character instead of two.    Lailah: Pretty funny character with puns and random wacky moments. She also has a lot of backstory to cover throughout Sorey's journey. It's pretty funny when other characters beat her at coming up with puns for the current situation too lol.    Edna: Also a funny character with how she continuously trolls the more suspectible or naive characters in the party. She also has a very sarcastic way of speaking pretty much 24/7.    Rose: Her purpose is mainly to do what Sorey can't.   Such as murdering people  . She's a pretty down to earth character who gets the job done.    Alisha: Likeable character with a strong sense of justice and someone who is willing to work for that justice. Her history nerdy interactions with Sorey are quite nice to see too.   Too bad she leaves the party permanently early on      Dezel: Pretty boring character, either doesn't speak much or the game tries to subtly show that he is looking out for the party but most of the time he's quite distant with the party and doesn't interact much at all.       Zaveid: Really makes the character interactions and skits much more humourous.       There aren't as many skits as previous titles and they aren't nearly as funny as Graces, Xillia 2's. Also many skits require you to sleep at an inn multiple times to view which is annoying.    Graphics (7/10)     Landscapes and dungeons are gorgeous to look at.    Character models use very vibrant colours compared to the previous Tales games which is a nice touch.    Towns are extremely boring to look at in this game, they are all some variation of a castle town besides a couple. None of the towns stand out, compare this to Xillia's Fenmont or Graces' desert or military snow towns.    A few tilesets recycled from Xillia, the forests and caves.    Arte visuals are a lot less flashy than previous Tales games, Graces included and that was a Wii game. I'm guessing they did this to improve performance after the past few games had FPS issues with heavy arte spam.    Music (10/10)   The music in this game is amazing holy ♥♥♥♥. Especially the trial temple dungeons and dragon fights.  The water temple was annoying as ♥♥♥♥ but the music made the annoyance so pleasant, that's how amazing the music is.    Thank you for Go Shiina &lt;3  In general Zestiria is a 7/10, it's an enjoyable game with a decent story and characters but it has some pretty obvious gameplay issues and questionable design decisions.",

This game has potential, but feels rushed. This isn't my first Tales of game, and it isn't my worst experience. Tales of Symphonia 2 still holds that title. This game however doesn't even come close to my favorite, Tales of Vesperia. This story rockets by at lightening speed, and by the time an area is done you barely understand whats happening. Some aspects are dwelled on for far too long, and others come and go faster than Vanilla Ice's career. This makes characters seem schizophrenic. One scene they're serious and cryptic, then the next they're bubbly and clingy. The main mcguffin is 'purity', but it's purity in this bizarre christian sense. One moment that stood out as weird to me was when Edna made a comment about the main character 'guilt tripping a woman into making the first move', the main character then gets yelled at about 'maintaining their purity'. This raises so many questions. I can't be the hero anymore if I shoot a load? What are the logistics of human-seraph relationships? Would this be considered cheating, or polygamy?  With all that said the story does have some fun story bits. If you like JRPGs, and Tales of it definitely has it's moments. They're just no where near as good as some of the previous games. Character interaction is as good as ever, and will bring a smile to your face. I'm seriously hoping it gets better later.  Next the game is tutorialized to hell, and back. I'm 6 hours in, and STILL getting tutorial messages. This combat system is needlessly padded, and complex. I've just started smashing buttons because this is worse than a fighting game. All the combos, artes, elements, combined forms. It's trying to evolve the combat system, but all it does is confuse it. The combat system works, but it definitely takes a time investment to learn everything.  This is a knit pick, but while the art in the game is great, why does the combined forms (I can't remember the made up name for it) turn Surey into a transvestite? Seriously, he grows hair about 5 feet long in what appears to be a pony tail, and wears a dress complete with high heels.  At 6 hours in this is really a first impressions, but as I said my first impression is neutral. I'm gonna keep playing it, but it hasn't sucked me in like Tales of Vesperia, or Tales of the Abyss. I'm hoping it gets better.",

Tales series definitely has been hyped up for a long time and for a long time to come.  It's not wrong, and it's not all that right.  The game definitely has some intense grinding, a ton of achievements, quite a few funny skits, and cutscenes.   You'll cry, laugh, get angry, fustrated.... maybe not in the literal sense except for the fustration. You'll definitely get fustrated. If you never get fustrated, at least once in this game, you're playing the game wrong. But seriously, let's keep our mind out of the gutter. Anyways, back to the main topic, aka the in my opinion reviews.  The amount of time it requires to complete the game is definitely worth it, especially for a first playthrough.  If you're like me, who has the crazy psychotic tendencies to grind a game to completion(story/side story) on the first playthrough; you'll most definitely contribute a ton of hours to the game, averaging around 60-70 hours. Of course, like many Tales games, since I have not played them all, contain a New Game + mode, after you've beaten the campaign. The content which is only exclusively available after you've slaved your way through the final boss.   So far, the game appears to contain a satisfactory amount of replayability.   My review so far:  First playthrough: 8.5/10  Second playthrough: --/10 (still a work in progress)  Content: 9/10  Story: 8.5/10  Replayability: 9/10  Definitely had my hypes, but the ending lacked something to be emotionally inspired in the positive way. If you want to get angry, cry tears of sorrow, and potentially hate life, then I would suggest beating the game in Chaos mode. Because you'll definitely experience some type of negative emotion as you fail fighting some of these boss type characters.   Overall, game is great, enjoyable, and the best part is: No microtransactions, unless you want to include some of the DLC which is not needed to beat the game, and is mostly used for vanity purposes.  If the games on sale, definitely buy it. If not, it's up to you. Either way, it's still up to you. It's your money afterall, or at least I hope it is....  I hope you ladies and gentleman enjoyed my attempt at a slightly funny, and potentially sarcastic review.  See ya'll in the world of Zestiria, or not 'Citizen A who is ignorant to the impending Calamity....'  All jokes aside, enjoy!",

The story is good for the first half, but you'll soon guess everything out in the middle. Then the result just confirms your guess, and you'll feel disappointed at the end.  If the battle system can be 'less' but 'deeper' it would be a much better game. Also they need to make the ending not easily guessable by basically everyone just half in the game.   The graphics is fine, not as astounishing as the best RPGs from 2015 such as the Witcher 3, but it's fine for itself.   I recommend it to anyone who loves JRPG and can get it under $10.",

Oh right I'm reviewing the game, not the anime...

The game originally had a 30fps cap, but you can manually release that and play at 60fps. no problems here  Gameplay 9/10 (Remember, there is quite the learning curve for non-rpg players such as myself)  Well, I don't play RPG's so much as Final Fantasy, ETC. So I had to go through a learning curve. I still don't get some of it, but then again, I've only played 7 hours. I'm sure I'll learn as the time goes on.  Enjoyment 10/10  I really never found myself bored in this game, whether it was the cut scenes or heat of battle, I'm thoroughly enjoying this.  Overall 9.75/10  I really don't see a reason why you shouldn't play this. Sure it's not as good as final fantasy or various RPG's but it's still one I consider to be fun and that's all that matters.

I felt the controls were ported quite well to PC and suited the combat system quite well. While Zestiria doesn't exactly shake up the Tales formula it does an excellent job in refining the series' classic 'Improve your playthrough each time' setup where you're rewarded with benefits in your New Game+ playthroughs based off of how well you performed on your previous playthrough and how thorough you were in said playthrough. The characters are all quite likeable, I'm particularly fond of Mikleo and Edna and their personalities mesh excellently. The classic skits are all wonderfully written and often a good laugh. The story is quite well written and there are a few moments throughout the game that have a particular weight to them that you'll really feel (trust me you know which moments I'm referring to when you hit them.) The soundtrack is of course excellent as they generally are in Tales games. There is of course the usual fun of finding/unlocking all kinds of cosmetics for your characters, the majority being either very goofy or references to past games. The combat is nothing too special, it's a fairly simple variant of the classic Tales combat with the usual one or two changes they do each game but it is quite polished and fun to utilize. All in all this is a game I truly enjoyed and when I first got it I didn't really stop playing it for anything other than to eat, sleep, or work so it can quite certainly pull you into it and get you invested into it.",

It's not the best of the series, especially the story, but it does an excellent job compensating for the generic plot line with some top notch character interactions and comedic relief. Let's break it down all spoiler-free like for you baby.   Plot  As I mentioned in my sterling prelude, the plot line was very generic. It's your typical boy meets world, world needs saving btw boy is the chosen one. It seemed to lack a lot of the twists and turns that typical Tales games are known for, not that it didn't have some moments, both of the serious and of the laugh-so-hard-the-optional-boss-destroys-you-while-you-wipe-your-tears-away variety. Side note: Some blood in cutscenes when people get stabbed would be nice, just what are you trying to teach these kids Bandai? The characters really do save the story from being abysmally cliche, or at least distract you from that fact. And to reiterate, it's not that the game didn't have some gut-wrenching all up in your 'feels' moments, you just saw them coming from like the 5th dungeon away.   Gameplay  The more action oriented Tales battle systems have never been a selling point to me, this one was no different. You will certainly swell with accomplishment as the pieces to this woman composed entirely of rubik's cubes slowly fall in to place. It felt like the tutorial didn't end for me until I was around 30 hours in, and I've played several other Tales games. It is not quite as convoluted as my previous statements make it out to be, but as somebody who likes to understand every aspect of gameplay, it took a while to pick up on all the nuances and complexities of the numerous mechanics.   Overall  ♥♥♥♥ yeah I'm recommending this. If for no other reason than that optional boss killed me a second time before I finally stopped laughing. If you're into JRPGs none of the cons to this game should bother you. Cliche plot, intricate gameplay are all pretty standard for the genre.   And if you aren't into JRPGs, stay away. It'll make a weeb out of you. Seriously. You have no idea how hard it's been for me not to claim Edna as my waifu while writing this, and I pretty much just did anyways. 10/10 might have become a lolicon",

I got a solid 28 hours out of this game from just completing the main story. I plan on doing a New Game+ and also maybe doing the Alisha DLC.  The thing about this game is it is incredibly story driven and at times the story is very cliche but the way it's told, the emotions I felt at certain points. Just staring blankly at the screen as the credits rolled while tears streamed down my cheeks. Maybe I'm too sensitive or maybe it's just that amazing of a game.  The cinematics really pulled this together both the in game ones and the full on anime ones. The skits also were incredibly funny as the characters were so well done, all bringing something different to the table. I loved how funny some of the people were how much after Lailah going on about something weird I'd laugh and say 'I love you Lailah, you're rediculous'.  I won't go on anymore because this isn't as much a review but just my rambling on how I feel about this game (I love it by the way). I reccommend this game completely and you all should go buy it.",
