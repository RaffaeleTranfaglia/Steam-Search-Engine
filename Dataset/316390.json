            "review_text": "Being a huge stalker fan I really tried to give this game a chance. I invested 20+hrs to dig a little deeper than most of the reviews of ppl with less than 1h playtime. Unfortunately it was a waste of time and I came to pretty much the same conclusions.  It's a real shame as in theory there's everything in place to make a great game (crafting, skills, barter, professions and different classes, lots of quest and huge map to explore, pve &amp; pvp etc..) but the overall execution is utter ♥♥♥♥.  Devs are working on a v2 on the unreal engine (beta opens in february). It basically means that despite what they say this game is officialy dead and there's no improvments in sight. Huge potential, terrible disappointment.",

            "review_text": "I loaded the game up and was greeted with a screen of my character which had no body. Alright fair enough, the game has some bugs on release. So I logged in, the game has some weird camera feel to it, it's like my FoV is 50 and there's headbob when you sit still. The game runs... okay I guess for what it looks like and being a mmo. I started a quest, got a gun, and had some of the most awkward feeling gun combat ever. I've played f2p CS knock offs that felt more natural. No iron sights, gun accuracy is random, and for some reason you have a loading bar pop up for every interaction. Want to switch guns? Here's a loading bar even though you already have the other gun out.  I started pelting homeless npcs with rocks, until another player came by and we had a rock fight. Which was interrupted by some random dude clipping through the ground with only his neck and head visible. I then wandered for a bit, found some NPC guards who walked like they ♥♥♥♥ themselves all the way down to the legs. I then decided I had had enough.  RIP STALKER",

            "review_text": "I guess this review is a long time coming. I have 900 or so hours on steam and even played before steam release. I have traveled the sands of gamedom and this is the only game that scratches the stalker itch. Sorry in advance for spelling and grammer errors.   First off to the guys claiming its a terrible clone. If this is a 'clone' why arent the other games on steam? Most of the negative reviews are from scrubs that did not give the game a chance or expect the super kawai, ♥♥♥ circle of tickling, ez mode type of game. The guides on steam can help if you get frustrated or dont like to figure things out on your own. Ok now to the review.   I guess like others I will break it down into a pros and cons list. For me, this is what stands out.  Pro  The atmoshpere is great. I love travelling through the zone. You have to figure out your own paths around the maps. I run my graphics on high setting and get around 45-72 fps, I am playing on and older MSI GT 70 OD laptop my perfromance is decent except for a few issues.  I like the way that clases are set up. Any class can be resonably good at anything. However, classes are specialized. As a druid I can get to tier 4 of assult rifle skills, but only fighter/assualter types will reach tier 6 of assualt rifle skills. However, as a druid I can get to tier 6 in medicine; I can get rid of serious wounds in the field.   Artifact hunting. This is just plain fun. It is a very high risk, high reward activity. You do not simply run around picking them up tanking the anomaly damage. You need to use the Magnetic Grib Device and pull them out. Throwing stones to get the anomalies to 'show' can also get the attention of uhm ... well mutants of all kinds. Again this is a high risk, high reward.  Crating/Barter. This is a in depth and evolving system. Almost everything you find has a use at some point. I dont have a crafter so there is loads I dont know, out side of medical crafting.   Difficulty. Many people dont like this this game becuase it is too difficult. I like a challange. I dont know what else to say. Sure I sometimes rage quite after getting bounced in two anomalies and landing in another to be stuck.   Cool events. They do ingame/store/face book events. The time difference can make comunication with devs and community organizers a pain. You can win. I won a facebook event and got a bunch of good injectors for my clan.  PvP. Base and fortifacation fights are enjoyable , most of the time. The ability to barter at a base makes controlling one important. Running into enemies in the zone is exiting, the fights can be a rush. Fighting for areas like conductor spawns, swamps, wastelands can be super fun The international community makes pvp politics exciting. If you are into that sort of thing.   Name and shame. Aimbotters list are published. I love the tears and derps.  90 % of the gr/web store items can be obtianed in game. Its not easy and requires some investment.   Cons Performance. This is an issue. I have to restart my client after a coupe of hours or when switching to a large map (like caravan). Some times objects, textures, sprites just disapear. This can make gathering items more frustranting and dangerous than it needs to be. Some areas are worse then others.. I am looking at you brutor cave.  Weapon balance. There are many and many guns that just plain suck. Snipers and assualt rifles for pvp. Shotguns for pve. AK model assualt rifles are the end all be all. The Barrett sniper rifle is just insanely difficult to get. Jackhammer is the pve gun of choice. As a druid, I use ak 107, and am working on the skill to use level 5 class weapons (take 10 mill exp).  Grindage. After about level 18 it does get a bit grindy. There are repeatable missions and areas where you can farm massive exp to ease the grind. There is still quite a bit of grinding, and some mission rewards are often not worth the effort to complete once, much less repeat.  Pvp can turn into a camp fire furball. Where people just rush out of the safe zone zerging over and over again. It doesnt happen much, and doesnt last long usually. The situation still is not fun and a waste of time. Some people will try and and grief and camp you. Being a lowbie and fighting some one level 18 + can seem like an impossible task.  Confusion. The game is pretty indepth and the mechanics are confusing. A person using a shot gun vrs a person in full pvp gear with a shield artifact and haor running will do no damage. This leads to people thinking the game is broken or some one is cheating. Fiend ranged attacks can hit you through the smallest of openings.  Over all I love the game. Sure it has problems, all games do. Its up to you to decide if you can take the good with the bad. For me its worth it. The zone is an exciting and fun place. There is always, and I mean always something more to do. There is so much more I could say. The zone is a large and dangerous place. It is not for every one as you can tell by the neg reviews. ",

            "review_text": "Hello everyone,  Szone is a different game, unlike most MMO's or Survival games out there, Szone has taken whats great about a MMO and whats great about a Survival game and they have put it together. If you die, you lose items in your inventory depending what you are carrying, any items equipt will not be dropped, this allows players to have a purpose when killing others, it is not your average tab target MMO where you die, run out, die again, repeat, no.. This mmorpg is about fighting or befriending who you want for whatever reason you want, the purpose can be to take their loot or mabye you have some unresolved conflict with them earlier? Mabye you want to be their friend but you decide you dont like them and want to part ways with their belongings?  What you do is only limited by your creativity, this game has a completely player driven economy, clans take bases which allows them to acquire rare devices such as land mines and then that clan has the power to decide who can and cant have these devices, this is what starts alliances and wars, clans will either decide they want to help the clan in control of the rare resources/devices so that they can get some too eventually or they will decide to wage war to take what they want.  The PVP combat can be compared to counterstrike, rust and dayz, there is bleeding, illness and medicine to heal like dayz but turn the wrong corner and you will die in a heartbeat from a fully automatic AK which will fire similar to counterstrike, the reason i say counterstrike is because the recoil and spray resembles counterstrike more than it does dayz or rust. The Political/RP aspect to PVP could be compared to Darkfall: Unholy Wars or Arche Age, you fight for bases / fortifications, you control the resources, the goal is to control the game.  Now when you start the game you will probably be put off by the mid 2000 style graphics or the unexplaining UI/controls but if you can see past the early game difficulties, this will become a game almost any mmo/survival game enthusiast will enjoy and about those mid 2000 style graphics i mentioned, this game is going to go to the Unreal 4 Engine eventually, it has already been announced, the game is released but still has alot of plans for the future.  I could go on for ages about this game, i have not even scratched the surface about everything i would love to say about this game, all i will say is just try the game, see for yourself, give it a few hours, you wont regret it.  See you in the Zone, Reno  Character name: RenoTheOne",

            "review_text": "Here is my review for sZone-Online,  First off, ive been playing sZone since it was pre-steam.  For a lot of people sZone is a cheap ♥♥♥♥ game, the surface is suggesting this nicely, but getting to the core of the game it is far more, it sure is still rough edged and having balance problems but to the core and the mid to endgame this game is nicely polished and enjoyable, especially with other people to play with.  So sZone gives you a huge world to play with, but the problem is with all this freedom you dont know where to go or what to do, hence you get frustrated at a certain point where you advance too fast and get your ♥♥♥ handed to frequently.  The Fighting is tough and very raw, in PvE as in PvP, getting the system to know can help alot and getting to memorize how it works. This game is far from beginner friendly but if you actually invest time and stick around talking with people and get some guidance, you are off for a good time in this game, it has a good STALKER feeling to it the more you play and the more you advance.  Exploration is key in this Game, and figuring out new things from time to time, if it is how to efficent hunt animals for components and produce advanced goods to sell them with profit. Or go ahead and be that one guy guiding others through the Zone for a bit of money, there is alot of potential for your playstyle. The game used to have alot of different people going about in the game because you cannot suit every role.  Stick to quests and think economic will get you quite far in this game, aswell being curious going about and exploring the Secrets of this Zone, but know your comfortzone dont speed up and rush over your skill level or else you'll have a very bad time.  The Verdict is,  Play it, its alot of fun but try to communicate and get other people to play it, cause the game lives off other people, and cooperating together to explore and to prosper, you'll get only so far on your own.",
