            "review_text": "This is a great game that should please most fans of the genre. The game appears simple on the surface but there is lots of depth that slowly reveals itself upon repeated plays. The power up system allows for lots of customization and the stages offer branching paths that open up harder routes for good players. While the scoring system is a much overused chaining system, it 's a rush to build up the medal value and rack up tons of points. This is a very fun game and it's worth every penny to shooter fans.",
