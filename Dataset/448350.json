            "review_text": " Case #8  is yet another cookie-cutter first person horror game. I'd say it's a technically poor one, but despite the frequent crashes and bugs, it does get an acceptable framerate, so overall it's average for its genre in that area.  Walk around a bunch of poorly lit rooms, pick up items and activate arbitrary event flags so that you can open doors and walk around more poorly lit rooms. If that sounds boring as hell, don't worry. The game also attempts a few jump scares, which lack any followup and thus end up being about as scary as a typical YouTube Poop.  The story is a different kind of bad in each chapter. Chapter 1 sets up the bland 'escape the place' plot common among amateur games. In chapter 2 you have to glitch yourself through a door to get some dynamyte, which you then stand too close to as it goes off in order to set up the next chapter. Chapter 3 is a clone of  P.T.  I haven't played or even watched  P.T. , but I can still tell it's a clone because the level's Steam Trading Card is labeled 'P.T.' I guess when you admit your game is a rip-off it instantly becomes an homage. Finally, chapter 4 reveals that the player character committed the crime that the game said he committed at the beginning, and then ends with a 'To be continued.' So in summary, the game goes from cliché storm to idiot plot to borderline plagiarism and concludes on an anticlimax. What a great way to spend an hour and a half.  It's okay for the game to suck, though, because it's only four dollars, and everyone knows that MSRP is the only metric on which we should base our expectations. Nevermind that good games like  Ballpoint Universe: Infinite  are in the same price point; if it's under five bucks, all standards go out the window!  Seriously, though, ♥♥♥♥ this game with a red herring laser mechanism.  UPDATE: Just noticed that the  vast  majority of positive reviews are blatant sockpuppets (no details, just 'Good game', 'Cool game', 'Nice horror', etc). Peace, this isn't the App Store. You're trying to sell to people who actually enjoy video games; people who are more savvy than you're apparently used to. This kind of behavior reflects  very  badly on you, so cut it out.",
