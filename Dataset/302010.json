            "review_text": "While it is pretty to look at, The Blue Flamingo is rather underwhelming as a game.  1) Control lag and movement inertia. I hope you don't like having fine control over your ship. It makes the game vastly less enjoyable to play as a result.  2) Enemy design is incredibly basic. There's a lot of the same enemy from the last level, who flies the exact same way and shoots the exact same way, over and over, level after level. There are even enemies that litereally do nothing but take a bunch of hits. Nothing remotely interesting starts to show up until you've looped the game around six times.  3) Weapons are dull and uninteresting. Leveling up your shot only increases fire rate. No shot type selection or variety to choose from.  4) Color selection. In most games of this type, certain colors are reserved for important information (such as enemy bullets), so they are always visible and clear. The nighttime cityscape background breaks this basic design rule, as bullets and enemies blend seamlessly into the background colors. Lucky for us enemy fire is absurdly predictable.  5) Menus ignore your button config; you always have to press enter to do anything regardless of what you set for your action buttons. Also they use blinking text to show what you are highlighting, meaning you have to wait a second just to see what you're actually selecting.  In conclusion, The Blue Flamingo has sloppy controls and uninteresting gameplay. Not recommended.  If you're looking for good shmups on Steam, I can recommend: Crimzon Clover, Kamui, Jamestown, Alltynex 2nd, Astebreed, Danmaku Unlimited 2, Ether Vapor Remaster, RefleX, and Satazius.",

            "review_text": "The Blue Flamingo is a bit of an experimental game. Not gameplay-wise but in the way it was built. You see, the game was built entirely using handcrafted models. Effects, explosions and rocket flares were all made with firecrackers and other pyrotechnics and objects like cars are being pulled forward by strings with magnets. It’s really ambitious. But does ambition automatically produce a good game ?  At its core The Blue Flamingo is a shoot ‘em up, meaning you control an aircraft that you can move across the entire screen and by pressing (and holding) a button you’ll shoot bullets (or drop a bomb) while enemies keep approaching in waves. After a few levels the speed in which these waves approach will increase and things get more hectic. If you’ve ever played a shoot ‘em up before you’ll notice the game doesn’t really reinvent the genre. Except for one thing: scoring points.  By killing groups of enemies successfully you’re awarded a coin that you can pick up by moving your aircraft over it. These coins act as your score. At the end of each level, of which there are just two (day and night), you get the opportunity for some target practicing. Targets will move across the screen in all kinds of directions and it’s your job to hit them all. I’m not sure what happens yet if you hit them all, but I’m sure it awards you extra points or maybe even a bomb. Let it be clear that there are no boss fights in this game. After each level you can invest your collected coins to purchase upgrades (which will then lower your score with that same amount of money) or you can decide to continue without purchasing anything and then receive interest over it. So do you want to spend money on upgrades in the hope that you can earn it back or do you take the risk and hope that your current aircraft will do the trick as get you as far as you can. It can be a difficult choice, especially later on when levels get harder and harder. Upgrades are limited to better guns and extra bombs by the way. So you can’t make your aircraft fly faster or give it extra armor. It’s an interesting concept but there aren’t any real rewards. It’s just to get a better high score. And while this might be enough for some people for me it isn’t. If you introduce a risk &amp; reward system I want the reward to something better than just a better score. Give people new skins, different aircrafts or different guns, things like that; something to play for and something that keeps people coming back. But then again, for a small game like this it’s understandable. I just don’t think people will play it for hours and hours, which is a shame considering the amount of effort was put into creating it.  I’m not going any further into the graphics, at least, not so much. Most of the things I wanted to say about it have already been said anyway. The game has a unique look, but because of the filming of the backgrounds things have become blurry, unfortunately. This was to be expected and I’m not blaming the developers here. It was an artistic choice and that should be respected. Sounds are basic and the music doesn’t really fit the game as far as the atmosphere is concerned, but there’s nothing really wrong with it. And the controls are smooth and navigating the screen works just fine without any problems. Collision detection is also good.  In the end Might &amp; Delight managed to give us a cute little shoot ‘em up with The Blue Flamingo. It gives us a unique choice on managing our scores but ultimately falls short because it doesn’t really offer any replay value except for the fact that you can beat other people’s high scores (or your own) on the leaderboards. A bit more variety and content rarely ever hurt a game, but for this price we can’t really complain. Just don’t expect anything revolutionary here.  [Rating: 64/100]",

            "review_text": "This game takes place over beautiful hand crafted miniature set pieces, and each sequence is displayed in stunning 320p with a variable frame rate. Don't worry about missing any of the outstanding visuals in the fray of combat, because all you have to do is sit on the bottom right corner of the screen to avoid 95% of the gameplay.  These scenes are accompanied by an original flamenco soundtrack that even amidst the chaos of battle stands out as being delightful and upbeat, yet exceedingly soothing. Again you need not worry that the nuance will be thrown out with the beat as unrelenting machine gun chatter takes focus, you can rest assured once your mouse finger begins to cramp from constantly holding down the button you will soon discover that you don't actually need to fire your weapon 95% of the time.  You must now be interested in the remaining 5%, where it would seem the cream awaits. Well the game runs out of original content long before you reach it, in fact there's only about 3 levels with unique miniatures and music, after which point you have only repeats as the level number continues to increment. This is perfect though, because there aren't any checkpoints. It would be a real shame, after all, to fall short and be deprived of an ending as lovingly created as the rest of the art content in this game. There isn't an end though, you just uninstall.",

The intended effect of handmade models being used for the game's assets isn't as noticable as you may hope when purchasing the title. The lack of extra lives (maybe you can get them with a high score but I haven't played enough to be very good at it to unlock them if so..) as well as a lack of end-level bosses is a bit of a dissapointment, as huge end level bosses seem to be a staple of this genre of game. Cool concept, and if you want to support the artists endeavor then go ahead and pick it up, but when considered as an actual game is when it begins to lose its luster.",

You fight the same few boring enemies. You make no real upgrades or changes to your ship. Game doesn't explain there is no level saving, which there isn't. Your damage also carries over between levels  (wait.....wha?!) , which is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Oh yeah and they don't let you know beforehand. If you die you lose all progress of all levels. And guess what, there is no healing or way to restore health......yes they were that stupid in game design. You use a boring bullet shooting with no real powers besides some aoe you can use one time then have to buy again. There is nothing positive about this game besides the backgrounds and the music. 3.5/10.",

While I appreciate all the effort put into the graphic department (the whole game graphic has been created from handcrafted miniatures), this game is lazy at everything else: you get, like 1-2 minutes of astonishment for how good the graphic is, and then you realize that you have been conned.  Here is a very short, bulletpoint list, of what it's good and what's not:  + great graphic, everything on the screen looks cool ('The Swapper'-like cool) - almost no contents: 2 stages (the same one, but cycled between day and night) and like 4-5 enemies top. If you get past level 2 you have seen everything - embarrassing controls: the game difficulty is not in the mechanics, but in how awkward it is to pilot your ship  - horrible gameplay: you get money for the kills, but you get to use them only for extra firepower and bombs (no repairs, for instance). It looks as if they where trying to hide how short the game is by making it more difficutl than it needs to be.  Now, I understand how difficult it must be to put together a game with digitized contents, but on the other side, but this game is an embarassment (even more so after I played 'The Swapper').  It would be worth 1-2E top, but for the current price tag, it's a fraud (good thing I got it in a bundle with better games in it...)",

The game does start to pick up at around level 5, but there's no way I can tell to skip to level 5. You can collect coins for killing groups and upgrade your guns and bombs, but it doesn't really seem to do much. Shmups should be precise, but the bullets and rockets shot by the “guns” are somewhat random. The ship itself is also somewhat “floaty”, so you never totally feel like it is your fault when you get hit.   I only played like three times. On the third game I was actually starting to wish I would die soon because it was getting so boring. There’s really no reason to play this.

This one ship has a set amount of health, and there's no way to repair it. It's certainly interesting, but my personal tastes are for games that are a bit more laid-back. Furthermore, your scoring system is the money you get for shooting ships. If you spend some of that money to improve your ship (with a wide selection of two different upgrades!), then you've just cut into your final score. It really makes me wonder if the upgrades are even worth it. Still, you gotta love the full controller support, and I'm sure that a lot of my gamer friends would appreciate the permadeath challenge this game provides, but it's not my kind of thing. To make matters worse, the maps aren't even randomly generated. You have the same threats coming at you at the same times every go-around, which just makes the permadeath that much more annoying. Unless you're willing to pay close attention to the little number that pops up every time you die and seeing a scoreboard filled with higher numbers motivates you to make that number go up, I seriously doubt that this is the game for you.
