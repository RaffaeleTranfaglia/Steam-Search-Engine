            "review_text": "I've got a couple more hours of gameplay on this than it shows. I took my PC over to my Grandpa's house, where we generally eat and watch crappy TV movies every Saturday or Sunday. No one there plays games. Period. Well, no one happened to be watching the TV, so I plugged my computer in and fired up steam in big picture mode, and started to play some Poker Night 2. Once I switched over to A Good Snowman, my family started to ask...  'What the crap is this?' 'Uhm... What?' and my personal favorite... 'You don't have a girlfriend, do you?'  But everyone kept watching. Then my cousin, my age, started to help. It took us about 15 minutes to figure out one of the puzzles, But when we did, it was like, 'ohhhhhhh, wow we're dumb'. My dad came over and watched a bit and laughed when I'd kick the tables or chill on the hedge while we discussed the strategy.  I must have told the game mechanics to five or six of my family, seperately, as they all started to watch and 'help'. My aunt finally plopped down and really started getting into it. I was starting to get bored, and tried to change games, but she started getting agitated and said, 'put the snowman game back on!'  After I handed the controller over, she played with intense concentration for about an hour before we told her we needed to leave. She asked if I could build her a PC so she could play it and other similar games on her own.  Thanks, Snowman team, You guys got some of my family to actually play with me. It's only taken 15 years to get to this point.",

You'd be surprised how much mileage they get with this simple idea. Puzzles are challenging but not frustrating (undo button and a reset button are handy). Pleasing aesthetics and music that ease you into a zen puzzle-solving state.",

I love everything that's been put into this game. It's full of fun.",

It's pretty short - between one hour and a couple of hours depending on how you approach it.  Is it worth the cost? If you enjoy puzzle games or want a short and relaxing experience, then yes. Otherwise you might want to spend your money on something else and wait until it's on sale.",

The puzzles are entertaining, graphics are cute and you unlock more and more of the hedge maze the more snowmen (I'd like to think of them as 'friends' to the monster building them, as all have names) you build which I think is a great idea. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. I liked it and I'll probably be returning to it again and again - if only because it's so sweet.   It's very soothing to play, I think, if you're not the kind of player that gets frustrated with puzzles easily. The difficulty increases the more you play and require more planning when it comes to rolling your snowballs. I haven't finished the game yet, but so far I'd say the difficulty is easy to moderate depending on each maze 'room' setup.",

This itself isn't a problem, but the difficulty curve is. There isn't one. If you're as dumb as me, and you probably are, you'll find yourself staring at the same puzzle for what seems like forever, randomly shifting snow around until you luck out and find something that works. The way it's so complicated and therefore reliant on luck rather than reasoning removes pretty much all satisfaction that you'd have otherwise gained from 'solving' the puzzle.",
