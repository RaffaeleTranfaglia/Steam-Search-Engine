I played this game for maybe 2 minutes and I already know it is a real catch, a sure keeper. I think that with support for every operating system, not including Mac or Linux, like it has will really push it's potential to become a game loved by my family and yours for generations. The art style, the music, and the character design are some of the greatest I have experienced in these 11 years I have been alive. Thanks for reading this, and have a good thanksgiving to those celebrating late. Amen, god bless, Papa Johns.",

The neko man, the Zoro wannabe and more. The music is suprisingly good, the humor is great, the controlls are better then some of the 1 v 1 fighting games from back in the day, the motion capturing is good and the breifs are white. The game has a problem with the fact that it can send you out into your desktop and you can see it at times in the game if it starts bugging out. The controlls are hard to find naturally so look at the manual for this game if you don't want the hardships with figuring it out like I had to. No acheivements or badges and no cost. So if you like 1 v 1 fmv fighting game with alot of humor then this free game might be something for you. Have fun, enjoy and wash your breifs :)",
