It's a great multiplayer action game with great personality, a hilarious game with a great sense of humour and utter ridiculousness, endless customization options, and a very direct and intense gameplay that has charmed us. The great thing about this game is that it allows you to play it the way you want. Seriously.  You'll be able to unlock in-game items, edit characters and customization easily no need to pay for DLC's just play, level up and you are ready to unlock mods, weapons, characters and many more. There are few things which need to buy DLC but isn't necessary, you can play very well after unlocking items without paying a single cent.  It's a FPS game for people who are looking for and it's better to play Gotham City Impostors for free rather than to buy $$ for COD. I bet you'll forget COD, if you'll play this game for once. Theres a lot of fun to play with friends and make if you don't have.  I don't know yet why this game is considering as dead which is not! People are still playing either they are old or newbies but play at particular time period. The matchmaking is a major drawback of this game because it's so freaking slow, but when you get into the actual the game is a blast and so much fun to play. Go ahead.. This game is free and worth to play. ENJOY!",

I literatlly see some of the same players everyday. 2:Servers; The servers on this game are HORRIBLE. Ive been disconnected from plenty of games for no reason. If those two problems were fixed,the game would be spectacular. I suggest playing it, even though it looks a bit cheesy. Its ALOT of fun,and its even better with friends.

A modest map rotation with a yet humbler player base makes for a warm cozy environment where in due time, everyone knows everyone else and you'd likely have a couple hours of supreme fun before moving on to the next big title.  8/10; a skill-based training ground to hone your sniping abilities which will somewhat carry-over to other FPS.

Ok...let me explain what this game is like...Its like a group of over weight, poor kids got together one summer day and decided to start a fight club loosely based on batman. They never really saw any of the batman cartoons but they heard of him from kids at school. So they all decided to gather at whoevers house had the biggest back yard. One kid brings along his brothers new ski googles and a stick he found in his back yard that sort of looked like a gun. Another kid found some oven mitts and a hard hat in his parents basement so he brought those. The only skinny kid in the group brings his dads welding mask and the hockey stick his dad uses to unclog the kitchen sink. Another brings a weed wacker with no gas in it. Another dresses up in foot ball pads and brings along his pellet gun. So there they are. All standing around in the hot sun wondering what to do next. The fattest kid starts yelling out some random rules of combat he thought up that morning on the toilet....and they go to it. Its pure insanity. That fat kid...who made up all the rules that first day...he became a video game designer. And that my friends is Gotham City Impostors.",

            "review_text": "I actually learned about this game from my Father. He had played it on the Xbox 360 and I hadn't ever seen him play before. A bit of people started to say it was really bad, but once I got into it I enjoyed the game. It -does- lag a few times for me which doesn't matter much as it only lasts about maybe a half second at most. Others have said they've gotten massive lag spikes, but I assume that might have been because of their internet. The game is wacky and silly which is why I love it. The customizations are amazing, but the guns -can- be a bit undefeatable if you had just started the game and don't know how to get around them. I do not recommend this for people who come into it and expect for it to be like Call of Duty, because it is not. There are crazy different gadgets that add into the games. They can be unpredictable and deadly as ever or totally predictable and harmless depending on the person on the other end. Overall I do recommend this game for anyone who likes to giggle at their game and customize their character with just pure craziness.",

            "review_text": "Gotham City Impostors is a fun, silly FPS about about a ton of batman stalkers who are obsessed enough to dress up like Batman, buy guns and try to abolish an entire other team of of people who are obsessed with The Joker and are trying to destroy The Batman stalkers. The teams are called 'The Batz' and 'The Jokerz'. You have a huge selections loadouts, guns and even characters, When you go into a game you have a selection of loadouts, the options of loadouts change everyday, So you might like the paladin loadout, It might dissapear the next day. I forgot to mention all of the loadouts have names like Trapper and Paladin, But you always have your custom loadouts, But before we get to that lets talk about the characters, Now there are alot of characters or 'Impostors', the only thing that sets them apart is much they weigh and whether they are a boy or a girl, Some are very fat and some are very thin, The skinny ones go faster than the more obese, Thats really it with the impostors. Customs Loadouts are a concern of mine, see this game is Free to Play but you need to buy special DLC in order to have any of the weapons, You will eventually get 'Unlock Tickets' but really, It feels like I am playing a demo of the game, I mean its fun trying the daily loadouts provided but if you want to stick to one playstyle you have to pay, This is kind of a Pay to Win game, The only reason I think this is Free to Play is because players are attracted to F2Ps or the fact that they were extra successful, I mean games like Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2 were huge and if they costed money they wouldn't be that big. So technically this costs money for the full game but you can play a free version with not as much content. There is no competitive I am aware of but there are many moments where you can yell 'MLG!!!' there is no campaign but I no one really cares. I can't really use this to judge against the game but its crude, its only to fit the attitude of the game but whenever the batz win the game it says 'who's laughing now ***clowns!?' and the catch phrases are edgy as well but as I said I can't use that to judge against the game. If you have a crap computer like me you'll get 20-40 FPS so it runs mediocre on bad computers, the graphics are cartoonish but right on!, The maps have an interesting atmosphere that I have never seen in any other game I've played, The people look interesting as well their character designs show how obsessed they really are, their not the most relatable folks but gameplay makes up for it, I love the games Icon or Logo its a cartoon batman but it looks actually hand-drawn, He appears on the menu, loading screen, lobby screen etc. The game is Very fun, it kinda has a strange senstitivity though I cant describe it but you'll know it when you play the game, There is a common bug were you start out with no keybinds, What the heck?. Some of the keybinds are confusing and uninmportant. If you ever accidentally rebind 'look right' to left click you might rebind it and move your mouse right and it will say 'Mouse Axis X is already set to look up, do you want to set it to look to look right?' despite that you can press 2 and everything will be set default but you will have to reset custom keybinds. Anyways Gotham City Impostors is a fun game with a good style, despite its pay to win style 8/10",

Plenty of options to allow low end systems to run the game nicely or to give decent hardware some extra eye-candy.  Sound is more than adequate with some great character taunts and stuff. Music is very appropriate to the setting and not annoying at all.  Usual MP game-modes with some twists.  It doesn't actually feel like a pay-to-win game to me so far. Play to unlock seems to be working fine for me ...   You can start group games with people on your Steam friends list or join through standard matchmaking.

Aside from all that, this is the best free game i have ever playes science Smite and Tribes Ascend! the gameplay and graphics are top notch and the costomization is unieque and this is NOT a pay to win game AT ALL!",

Of the 4 game modes, only deathmatch is played these days, no answer for that either. The dying out of it's fanbase is the only flaw in this game. It is very even when it comes to play type, every loadout has a counter measure to it, so there's never a way of purely overpowering your opponent. If you lose, it's your fault, not the game.",

Gotham city Impostors is what happens when grown men and women give in to that urge; (no not the one about dressing as a princess) dressing as Heroes with costumes inspired by Batman and Villains with costumes inspired by the Joker and go to war in the streets, amusement parks and industrial building of Gotham city!  Using weapons and gadgets inspired by both the ones Batman uses and the Joker’s sense of humour; it all ends up just as twisted as it sounds: jack in the box bombs, home made gliders and even home-made rocket launchers shooting out bottle rockets!  There’s quite a few costume pieces that can be unlocked in the game (or if you really are crazy: Bought with Microsoft points), allowing you to dress your character up like crazed hobo versions of Batman and the Joker!  You can even wear nothing but a mask, cape, underwear and rollerskates!  A very fun game, with the ability to find a play style that should suit anyone!",

You are also able to stack an in-game currency to get nice pieces of cosmetic gear to suit up your character There's also a leveling progression system that allows you to unlock more gear and advanced weaponry.   It's F2P and if you haven't played it just go and do it ya plebs. I like this game, it had great potential, but when the developers ignored it, it just lost its touch, what sucks is the internet connection, the fact that people ONLY play deathmatch and theres a fair ammount of bugs and glitchs, but overall, its fun and similar to Team Fortress 2, i hope valve will one day come into it and fix this game...before its all ogre.

Personally I love the grapple gun the most, simply grappling across the map is entertaining. I can't tell you how many times this gadget save my ♥♥♥ when I ran out of bullets in my clip. The costumes can be bought with in game credits (something which is quite a rare sight for me though I'm not complaining).

The idea seemed weird, a PvP shooter that takes place in Gotham City but almost little to nothing to do with Batman or the crass menagerie of Gotham's villains - but I think that makes it work. Instead of being 'superheroes vs. supervillains', you take the role of one of Gotham's more latently psychotic citizens and you fight others like you in small arenas with a surprisingly diverse array of weaponry and gadgets.    But that's also a downside. The game uses a system where you are awarded in-game credits for matches you take part in, and you get bonuses for various events such as winning. You can use these credits to buy more weapons and gadgets. Which is standard for many F2P shooters, but also standard to the F2P shooter is the inevitability of being in a match against somebody that has a jetpack while all you have are roller blades. True, the two can't really be compared since they are two different pieces of equipment with different functions - but none of that seems to matter after you get Superman-punched for the 20th time.    Frustrating? Yes. But it's also strangely motivating, after eating pavement for the xth time, it was only then I noticed I had been playing much longer than I had intended and was feeling engrossed in the entire experience of the game. Even when you get killed, the player who killed you utters one of several pre-determined lines of dialouge that range from snarky to snarky but kinda charming.    I haven't played the game that long, so I don't have much more to say about it - aside from that is IS an experience. Its unique, fun, and interesting. Definitely worth a try.",

I would say that the maps could offer far more crazyness in their design but they're good enough. The game offers a bit of verticality, in that you can glide and use your grappling hook to attach to buildings and what not in order to give you momentum in the air which is part of the fun of the combat.    The weapons are generic though. Some are fun to use but they're nothing you haven't seen before, in one way or another. It's just riffles, swords and bombs, most of them don't even look different like in Bioshock, they do look like generic riffles. Sometimes I felt I was playing the first Resistence game. Don't get me wrong, blasting and slicing is fun in any way, shape or form, but like I said, for a game that embraces crazyness, it's not crazy enough in some basic regards.   You can costumize your character for the different factions, being it the Bats or the Jokerz. It's somewhat limited, however the items (such as masks and bat-symbols) are so much fun and over the top that I didn't care.   That being said, if you are a Batman fan like myself (...which you can probably tell right away), you won't find much of 'Batman' in this. The Jokerz play like Joker's regular goons but the Bats are copycats of Batman... with guns. So they do play the same which is a missed opportunity in my opinion. The characters may look like they fit in the Batman world but that's about it. The gameplay does nothing new and you could pretty much insert any other characters in the game and the result would be the same. The novelty runs fast on this one.   However, I still recomend the game. It's free. And it's fun. You should definitely try the game, who knows, you may actually enjoy it. It's just too generic for its own good, which is a shame, but there's still fun to be had and it plays like a mix of Team Fortress with Quake. Only not as good as that sounds.   Do try it. You may enjoy it more than I have.",

            "review_text": "Extremely fun game. It's a cartoony, fast-moving fps with some interesting weapons and gear. Unforuntately not too many people still play, and the developer/publisher has long since pretty much abandoned this title, so don't expect any improvements to the current state. But the current state is good for a good several hours of enjoyment.   It's not perfect, my biggest problems with it are the occasional random freeze-ups and a couple instances of server lag and server connection loss. The lag and connection loss have been fairly uncommon in my experience thus far, but since it's a peer-hosted game, this will of course depend on the host that you happen to have. The freeze-ups seem to happen at least once or twice per match. I've seen a theory that they happen when someone enters/leaves the game.   Also some people may not like the fact that all of the content is heavily gated. The unlocks do come fairly fast, but weapon unlocks seem kinda rare in particular. However the great thing about it is that when you get an unlock key for something (weapon, gadget, body type, passive, etc) you can look through the whole list of items available and unlock any one thing of your choice without any sort of level requirements.   Some of the real cash purchases are kinda pricy imo, larger packs like the 'impostor kits' in particular, but I'd say the f2p model is pretty fair because you don't really need to spend money to compete, provided you learn the game and play well (and get a few level ups and unlocks).   My one somewhat-major gripe with this system is that the loadout slots seem to only be available through those pricy impostor kits i mentioned, which apparently limits free players to only the original 2 custom loadout slots (plus the handful of random loadout the game offers on rotation). I'd at least like to see the loadout slots be available for purchase individually and inexpensively. And maybe it wouldn't kill them to give you one free slot as you level up (I've yet to get one at lvl 42). (Yet to get one at whatever level I am now which is like 80something. So by now I'm pretty sure you never do get that third loadout slot for free).  Another somewhat-major gripe I have with the game in general is that they did that really annoying thing where they decided to make microphones always-on by default and there's no option anywhere to disable them. This is often not a problem at all..unless you get that annoying 12 year old screaming into his microphone. Unfortunately muting someone is also pretty clunky, from in-game you have to hit esc to bring up the menu, go to the players tab, and find the person you want to mute and click 2 as you hover over them.. So usually it's wiser to just mute everyone in one go.   And another problem is the match-making system. It doesn't necessarily always work right, and you might end up standing in a lobby by yourself waiting for other people while another lobby fills up. Exiting the queue and entering again sometimes fixes this. Though some times it just does seem impossible to get a match started, due to a combination of bad match-making and/or just not having enough players around.  Though there are threads on the forums on how to change your region if there are no players at a certain time, basically you go to your steam options and change your download region and restart the game. This has had success for me, but naturally if you change your region to halfway across the world your ping will most likely not be exactly perfect.   But the game really is damned fun, so I've been more than willing to put up with the flaws I've encountered.   To be honest, I'm edititing this review after going back to the game after a while of absense, and lately I've not enjoyed it quite as much as I did earlier. But I did get something like 70 hours out of this game, so yeah, I still highly recommend trying it. And it's free to play so it's not like you really risk anything.",

I tend to get more enjoyment from this game than I ever do in TF2, not trying to bash TF2 at all. TF2 is a great game too! The community is vanishing though, so it needs all the players it can get! I have to admit that there are some problems with matchmaking, and the fact that you can only get into team deathmatch now these days. Since there are no dedicated servers, players are chosen at random and they host the game. From time to time you get a terrible host, and the game lags out a lot, making it near impossible to play. When you get around the bad things, and get good hosts and people with decent loadouts, this game can be really fun! If it weren't for the constant problems, I would give this game a whopping 10/10. Sadly, due to these problems I am going to give this game a 9/10, which isn't much of a big difference from 10. This game is just that good!",

It plays like a slightly watered-down Team Fortress 2 with more maneuver options and weapon attachments. You are a poorly-costumed copycat of either the caped crusader, Batman, or his psychopathic arch-enemy, Joker. You join into combat with other poorly-costumed copycats against another team of poorly-costumed copycats and the best team of poorly-costumed copycats wins.  The Good: -The Customization: You are able to customize how your bat-fake or Joke-killer look with various logos, outfits, and what have you. -The Payment: The use of money in this game is almost purely cosmetic as you can unlock the same stuff with the proper amount of grind. -The Maneuverablity: It is really easy to get around the map and get to high points and other advantages. It is also very creative in it's methods. Example: One of my most diffcult choices in the game, mode of transport: Skates or Hangglider?  The Bad: -The Gunplay: Every weapon does roughly the same damage, barring any attachments added. It eventually goes down to, what I like to call, 'rock, paper, scissors' gameplay, -The Lack of ID: In game, it can get pretty difficult to identify if the person you are shooting at is on your side or not at times.",

            "review_text": "GC Impostors is a multiplayer shooter developed by Monolith and became free-to-play after a year.  Pros: There are not many levels, but those are well-designed, which is also true when it comes to the characters and weapons. Overally interesting and unique ideas in gameplay. Different gadgets and addons let you play in your own style. Good character progression with plenty to unlock and purchase, even on the 500th level. Visual customization options are nice, you can have your very own look on both sides. Challenges, achievements and feats are expanding the content range. Good humour and theme. I got a lot of packs after my purchase of the original.  Cons: Terrible lag, performance, server, and other issues making almost impossible to play the game. I cannot play the game even on the lowest settings. Worst game of all time optimization wise. Matchmaking is the same as before, so you might get onto a server where 80% of the players have bad ping. Also, there are server connection losses and other stuff to entertain you if you bored. Only a few game modes and a handful of maps. Some overpowered weapons and gear. With packs purchased through steam better equipment can be obtained early. Content which can only be unlocked via purchase. No actual expansions, maps, weapons, anything added for years. Not many players nowadays.  Overall, after more than 2 years of my purchase I still cannot play the game smoothly. The performance only slightly improved. It is a shame that good ideas were ruined by incompetent optimization.   OVERALL: 7.0/10 (FAIR)  Graphics: 8/10 World Design: 9/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Sound: 8/10 Replay Value: 7/10 Performance: 4/10",

            "review_text": "Will try to make this short  The game: GCI is a team-based shooter just like others you've seen, It features a decent amount of game modes and customization (clothes, weapons, profile, etc.) and works on the basis that on particular levels you can unlock something. It's kind-of like TF2 but with no set classes, and Batman V Joker based (don't play this if you hate either, as you'll be forced to play as them half of the time). Tutorial teaches you some of basics, but proves insuficient once you start the real thing (it's mostly 'stand and do this).   Pros: + Fun, fast paced, game + Good Customization Options + Stupid enough to make you smile + Decent amount of game modes (around 5) + Doesn't seem Pay2Win, but you really have to know what you're doing with your first unlocks (or save them). + Good balance of weapons, however as I mentioned you will need to level if you want access to any non-starting weapon. + Cool movies, but weird ones, what did you expect?  Cons: - Only one game mode is playable (Team Deathmatch), seriously, I queued every other game mode 3-5 times with no success. - Matchmaking doesn't exist, first online game (level 1), level 120 or so on the other, not even kidding (there's no stat boost or anything, but he has access to a lot of equipment and has a lot of exp that a new player just doesn't). My side had a level 90, rest of us were 1-8. - Both things might be because of this, but not many people play this. (Dead game). - You can only play as Batman or Joker. No Robin, No Catwoman, No Riddler (I'd love to play as Riddler, so it was a huge letdown) or any character you'd like to play as. - Only 6 maps. Yup, that's right, 6. Each of the game modes can be played on any map as far as I know though. - You can't change video options in-game, so you won't know if the configuration you picked runs smoothly until it's too late.  The opinion: As a light game or mod, this could be great, however as a full-blown game, with barely enough players that only allow for the simplest game mode, not worth the disk space. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, will keep you really entertained for a while, but you'll get bored sooner than later.  The rest: If you want something stupid, go find another fun multiplayer game. If you want something FPS team-based, go find another game. This game has a correct balance between both, but doesn't excell in any for it to be truly destacable. Nothing sticks out really, it's just a mixture of everything we've seen in MMOFPS., nothing original (apart from the funny disguises).   Recommendations: * More promotion, no players kills this game instantly. * More maps. * More disguisable characters, only 2 makes it boring. (Just change the name to order v chaos or something). * Joker small part of the tutorial (maybe in-field to help you get the hang of it?) * Altough it has a great start, still needs a little 'unique' thing for it to be a game on its own and not just 'the same game, but stupid and with batman' * Maybe in-game option change? That only screws you the first couple times you play, but could potentially screw you up a lot... * Rest is really good.",

(why!) if i want to stare at stats for 1 min ill look at them while the next game is starting. movement is off in this game too. it really looks cool and the intro to playing is funny but after that the game doesn't just go downhill. it drops off a cliff doing a nose dive into a punji stake. i wouldn't play this again if i got paid.

So you freeze due to lag, then your toon is locked in place by weapons fire, you die, the game can barely handle all this and you're still moving in slow-mo (if at all) when you respawn.  Skip it.
