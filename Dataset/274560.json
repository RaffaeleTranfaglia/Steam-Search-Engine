            "review_text": "Later on, mankind uses AI driven machines to wage war, yet this invert releases when the machines turn on their masters. To fight this risk, your top of the line pilot takes to the sky in an old travel to counter. The machines are summoning the land, sea and air so your battle won't be straightforward.   At first I felt that Change Expert didn't much issue with a story as the elucidation for why you are controlling an old stream against bleeding edge foes is simply revealed several levels into the beguilement. It doesn't have any kind of effect nonetheless, as no reason is relied upon to partake in some old school, level shooting movement. Disregarding the Shocking Engine controlled visuals, Change Master seems like it was detached straight from a nineties arcade machine. Unmistakably time has been spent on making the ground look fascinating with effects like trees affecting in the wind and mountains that climb up into the screen however the general effect is somewhat frustrating. It could just be my own slants, however the sensible style visuals essentially look a touch too much troubling for an over the top style entertainment like Bombshell Expert.   I can't accuse the contrasting qualities in any case, as the delight takes you transversely over unsettled areas, mountains and oceans, with a couple levels shrouded in haze or solicited in snow. There are irrefutably minutes where the diversion benefits look and there is emphatically no nonattendance of enemies to shoot at, yet there is nothing that really isolates the visuals from the pack.   Change Master is a genuinely coordinate shooter, yet there are a few novel things that make it worth a minute look. Firstly, enemies attack from both the air and ground and you use two separate fire gets to attract them. Weaving through shots while shooting on the right plane can be questionable at in any case, yet it soon ends up being second nature. Completing levels compensate you with experience centers and shrapnel. Experience centers are tallied up to fabricate the level of your fly, which prompts to prizes, for instance, more weapon spaces, new weapons and a liven of your choice. The preferences keep running from better covering to speedier slugs or strong laser and there are lacking levels to pick each one of them so you have to pick carefully. The shrapnel is your cash and is used to purchase the programmed rifles, rockets and bar firearms and moreover shields and exceptional strikes that make your specialty so significant. There are more than 20 weapons to peruse and the position on your fly matters which makes it diverting to mix and match to see what the results are.   The campaign mode felt to some degree longer than what you generally find in the class and upon fulfillment you can start a harder, New+ playthrough. There are similarly three inconvenience settings to give everyone a sensible shot at beating the entertainment. Enemies attack in substantial numbers and on Run of the mill or higher, the ones that you miss returns for another go, however the way that you have a shield and protective layer meter makes things stunningly less requesting. Shooters with one hit executes can perplex, so Uprising Master is a conventional introduction to the class that won't drive off newcomers.   If you understand blazed on the fight mode or feel like you need some extra experience and shrapnel you can explore different avenues regarding the Engagement mode. In Struggle you find the opportunity to pick a level from any of the ones that you have viably opened to practice or farm experience and shrapnel. Fundamentally more fun is the Versus mode where you play one beside the other with another player and can mess up their entertainment by sending enemies to their side of the screen. The Battle Chains mode works the same as Versus however rather than playing against some individual dynamically you challenge their recordings. If you complete the test you can send it back to the principal player who then need to fight with all the extra tumult that you brought on in the midst of your playthrough. The test increment quickly and this mode can end up being exceptionally addictive, however finding diverse players is not that basic right at this point.   I had a lot of fun with Change Master however this may be a result of me playing shooters since the start of the arcades. More up and coming players might be less thoughtful about the dull visuals and rather non particular sound. The controls regardless, are responsive and the preoccupation most likely packs a test, however isolated from the versus modes it doesn't by and large rise up out of the pack. I really favored the thought so in a perfect world LGG can make a turn off, which genuinely increment the era values.

            "review_text": "Many dubious elements make this game to be far from correct:  User interface is not very good: very little text font and not very well situated armor, shield and combo panels. Shop could have separate windows for air, ground, shield and superweapons, and show you precisely how the weapon works in another window. Instead of this, you have the not very handsome shopkeeper looking at you.  Inicial firepower is ridiculous. Enemies gather on screen even on later stages.  Has  two separate buttons for air and ground shotting . This is the worst idea ever! At minimum firepower it becomes frustrating: you shoot at the ground, air enemies get you; you shot at the air, ground enemies overflow you with bullets. There are even some bosses which can only be hit by ground weapons, which have usually the less damage.  Game probably expects you to grind money for weapons.  Enemies and scenaries seem to repeat themselves instead of being separated by theme or appearance. The result is monotonous levels, all of them very alike.  Bullet patterns from enemies and bosses do not seem to be very polished. There are moments where you will simply take damage whatever you do.  Enemy waves do not seem to have a lot of thought behind them. They seem random and sometimes they stay on screen until they are destroyed, whith at early levels can create an extremely tough situation.  Sometimes the game zooms in and you have less space to dodge bullets with no apparent reason. Also, when the screen turns ninety degrees it doesn't look very dinamic or game-like.  Your ship is not very pretty.  Story is just some scattered paragraphs.  Yes, this game is cheap. But mainly it lacks some more mind work on its gameplay.",

            "review_text": "Revolution Ace is an Old School bullet hell inspired game, but with a couple modern twists.  The core gameplay itself is basically the same, lots of enemies and lots of bullets, and you gotta shoot them all down. And at the end of the level there is a lovely boss battle awaiting your arrival.  If you are a fan of bullet hell shooters, this is a sure go for you.Especially since this game possesses a few extra things to it.Like ground targets, a level up system, bizarre water physics, a nice co-op mode, a versus mode, an 'offline' versus mode(basically like a highscore system, where you challenge your friends to beat it) and Hank your trusty engineer.  If your not a fan and got some spare cash, you might just give it a try, it is a nice and fun time killer.But the main campaign does drag itself a bit, possibly due to the leveling mechanic.  The game can also double as a nice bonding experience with a brother of friend due to some stages an insane mode being quite challenging, thus possibly requiring the aid of a partner to best them.  All in all it's a solid game, but it haves some issues, but it stays true to the genre besides it's added components. I'd recommend it, but don't expect a masterpiece.",

Keep your name simple and your progress will be saved!  Kids these days... Can't even keep it alphanumeric. Back in the days we had 3 (three) alphanumeric digits for our highscores at the arcade and still knew who everyone was.  We also didn't just ditch a game (or write a bad review) if there was a problem, without even checking if there's a solution. We had our Commodores, Apples and Ataris and we MADE games work!  Anyway...  As for the game, it's cool. I got it for 19 Cents, which is a steal. It's got cards and achievements, mappable controls and controller support. Gameplay wise as a Shoot'em'Up it does many things right, which will, over time, make you look past the not too shiny graphics. It's Unreal Engine but sometimes you might wish it was hand-drawn 2D instead.  To keep this short, there are extensive positive reviews by other people on here that I mostly agree with.

It also tries to modernize itself with a league of features, some good, some bad. To give a quick, and concise conclusion to this review? I would PERSONALLY rate RA as a 'Maybe/When Cheap' where you're paying cheap for the game itself. I got it for 20 cents, and my friend and I enjoyed ourselves. But for the majority of that time, we were enjoying each other's company in Co-op and not the game itself. Unfortunately, since Steam has only yes or no as an option, and I feel Yes is too strong an affirmation for this game, I'm picking no. Now I'll explain the Pros and Cons:  Pros: - The game has functional co-op for the most part, and while I'm sure the Devs might argue otherwise, I feel it was built with co-op as a main intention. I believe enemy HP is cut down somewhat in single player and the ship number is based on difficulty and not whether or not it's SP or MP. Also, the way the gameplay works, it has encouraged teamwork between the two of us beyond 'both of you shoot at it until it dies.'  - The game's versus ideas are great. The idea of being able to do offline challenge modes that escalate between you and your opponent, while done before, seems competently done. Direct versus is fun as you watch your partner do better or worse than you in certain areas, constantly trying to outdo one another's score and take advantage of competitive-only upgrades and modifications to equipment. Kudos to the dev for making their random levels work with this system as well by supplying the same seed to both clients.  - The game DOES fill a niche that we haven't seen met recently. At the heart of it is a game that wants to be 'Raptor: Call of the Shadows' if it were made today, with technological and game design advances. However, it can and DOES need improvement, the sort a Revolution Ace 2 would hopefully present.  Cons: - The perk system hurts the game because you cannot respec them, either grind ridiculous hard to have all of them or start over with another profile. It also directly gates off better weapon variety, weapon slots on your ship, and eventually, objectively superior weaponry/equipment.  - Weapons (and WEAPON SLOTS) being locked off by leveling means you don't actually do as much damage as you need to until you hit those high levels. And even then, it often doesn't feel like enough unless you've properly specced yourself. Another casualty of this is the feel of these weapons. They have generic sounds and since they don't tear through ships HALF as well as Raptor's or Tyrian's do? They not only feel weak, but are confirmed so. Complicate this with a A2G and A2A system where you specifically have to choose between the two (EVEN IF YOU HAVE WEAPONS THAT CAN DO BOTH, UNLIKE RAPTOR!) and the game makes you dance to its tune more than it needs to.  - A regenerating shield system that attempts to harp Raptor but falls flat because it requires you to stop firing, a bad idea for the following reason. It would've been better to just make it regenerate if you avoid being hit for a while to let you choose between staying in the fray and keeping it from getting out of hand or waiting for half to full regeneration in relative safety.  - Enemies come back again. Depending on the difficulty they can come back once, twice or thrice, or infinite times. You WILL have moments that feel less old school American shmup like Tyrian 2000 and more Japanese Bullet-Hell Shmup like Crimzon Clover, without the tiny hitbox grace that the latter trades off for dying on hit. Being overwhelmed is not only a very real possibility, it's a very real likelihood if you're not doing so well.  -Some enemies are incredibly annoying to deal with. Later levels involve enemies that quickly fly across the screen spamming bullets. I can only imagine the nightmare of Nightmare Mode, where you're trying to hit them knowing they'd stick around indefinitely if you didn't.  -Very inconsistent artstyle means you'll be facing enemies that look hobbled together from a variety of artists...because the credits demonstrate they WERE. This also means garbage like white bullets hidden by clouds and bright blue bullets that nearly match the background sky.  -A pointless storyline. Yes, shmups are usually games that don't need a plot, but the random blurbs you get every few levels hint at a mastermind and/or cause between the malfunctioning war machines...but doesn't at all elaborate, instead constantly presenting WHODUNIT? possibilities. Having no plot at all is actually BETTER than that.  -Their amazing water effects sounds great until you drop a super bomb on it and it goes through the grounds. They wanted to make that a special note? I'll make it a special one here.  Overall it's a game that I feel is playable, outside of a few bosses who apparently don't have synced up attacks in co-op. But it's a game you'll play through and occasionally pick up again for co-op purposes, not a game you'll keep coming back for more. Hence why I'd rate it as a Maybe, but since there's no Maybe and the cons outweigh the pros, a No is a must.",

Hardcore in the original, controller throwing sense of the word - but as rewarding as it is cruel. It tweaks my buttons in all the right ways. To get the most out of it, you should absolutely play with different character profiles, and explore different tech and perks as you level up - some just won't work, some will make things considerably easy. And remember to grind for scrap (the game's currency) - it's easy enough to get, just by playing the game. The random levels are a great touch that adds essentially infinite replayability.",

The Story is barely present, the enemies blend together after awhile, and the weapons are 'eh'. Oh and get this, the proccess to Revolution Ace  is called 'Shmupgame'. Really? It seems that not much love went into making it. No offence to the creators if in fact some love   did   go into making it.  If it had a   better   story, or on the go weapon upgrades, then I would like it a little better. But as it is  it's just kinda bland. I did like the challenge system of posting recordings of your runs and challenging other  people to beat your score, and the abillity to send enemies over to your opponent when you do well is nice.  That being said, I did have a little fun playing it, if my play time is any indication (nine hours as of writing). If you like playing every single shmup that you happen accross, then give it a go, otherwise can't recommend.",
