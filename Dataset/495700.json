            "review_text": "This is for me, the best point and click adventure of all time. It is superbly written, have great voice overs and everything is very intriguing. This is actually the CD-Rom version with all the voice overs.    I totally recomend this game. A timeless classic of it's genre that even today didn't meet it's match. The story is absolutely smart. The puzzles are not easy. The characters are very likeable and interesting.   If you can't handle the pixelated graphiqs, the remake of this game is on steam and very much worth your time, altough Tim Curry as the voice of Gabriel Knight is dearly missed.",
