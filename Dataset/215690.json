    "description": "Ghat's story is far from over: Zeno Clash 2 picks up where the deliciously brazen first game left off. After 4 years of waiting, the sequel to the surreal first-person brawler brings more variety in combat and levels, and even more bizarre storytelling into the beguiling world of Zenozoik.",

            "review_text": "As much as I liked the first game and was looking forward the second one, I stopped playing it after 2 hours out of frustration. I do not understand the design choices here, almost everything got worse.  ZC1 gradually introduced you to fighting moves, ZC2 presents you an overwhelming tutorial and then gives you zero hints during the real game. The fighting system in ZC1 was perfectly fluent, it seems very clunky in ZC2. Most of the interesting moves deplete your aggresivity bar, and once it is empty (very soon), you're stuck with just basic punches and the fight gets slow and tiresome. The moves in ZC2 are no longer intuitive, but are artificially created. There is needless complexity in having not just a fast and a strong punch, but you can use both for both the left and the right hand, and you need to alternate between them to achieve combos. Combos are the strongest artificial example here, you need to remember how to alternate between left and right attacks in order to achieve them. There's nothing logical in that. Also, it's very difficult to kick someone on the ground now. Simply put, it no longer feels like a real, brutal, raw, intense fight.  Introduction is also lacking in other areas, not just fighting moves. When you start the game, you find clams containing items, but you can't pick them up, and you have no idea why and what they are for. ZC1 told you that by eating fruit you regain health. In ZC2, there is no such hint, and all of those items are brownish or greyish something (I haven't recognized what they should represent), so you're left wondering. At least some tips would be nice.  The story in ZC1 was at a reasonable pace, and interesting, mostly using hints than revealing things. In ZC2 everything seems to be happening really fast and doesn't make much sense. It's like several book pages were missing between each of the cutscene. Moreover, it seems to go directly against the story in ZC1, the main character completely switched sides. Very confusing.  The open world - why?? ZC1 was very linear, but it made perfect sense, it was a freaking brawler. ZC2 seems to feature 'open world' which sports large open areas interconnected by portals and loading screens. First it breaks immersion, second it leaves you running around not knowing what to do (the map is so useless!) and the annoying critters respawn every time you enter the area again. The checkpoint system is the last straw - not knowing when the game was saved last and having no ability to save manually is a disaster in an open world game with large open areas.  Technically the graphics is OK, but for some reason I liked ZC1 graphics better. Surround sound support is broken, characters voices are nearly inaudible, you have to switch to stereo in the operating system.  It's a pity, I was looking forward so much to this game.",

            "review_text": "First off, if you haven't play the first Zeno Clash, it will be impossible to grasp the continuing story. So go play that first. Beyond its awesome melee combat system, words still don't do this game justice. It's just something that has to be experienced firsthand. This second Zeno Clash builds upon the first making it more open world, adding a few usable items for your character, and adds some new combat moves. The story, characters, monsters, weapons, and scenery are just as wacky as the first. The only thing I didn't like was the new 'Lock-on' feature which seemed to make combat a little more clumsy than before. Other than that, this is a brilliant sequel.",

            "review_text": "Zeno Clash 2 successfully improves on all of the shortcomings of the first one. And let me tell you; I had a blast playing the first one and I had even more fun playing the second one, even if it had a slightly higher learning curve in the beginning. Let me sum it up:  First; the graphics have been improved. It now runs on UE3 and it shows. It's sharp, runs at 60fps and looks gorgeous. The environments and characters are simply amazing. What a great world ! ACE Team sure knows how to build an intriguing, weird world.  Second; the world is now bigger (unfortunately still a bit too linear) and has sidequests. Third; Ghat (main character) has more moves, including the awesome looking and easily executed piledriver.   Fourth; you can now bring allies into some of the bigger battles. It also introduces co-op, so you can run around and fight bad guys with a buddy. Tell me that that doesn't sound cool, right ? Hell yes !  At the same time it also has some flaws, thanks to these new additions. Let me sum those up: The world is bigger, yes, but it's still divided into hubs. So instead of using one big world, it's split up which throws you a bit out of the experience every time you have to travel. These portals also look a bit out of place.  Since battles contain multiple enemies it's hard to use some of your newer moves. And while your allies are somewhat helpful, they can also get in the way when you're fighting (inconvenient when friendly fire is on). The game also locks onto enemies automatically, so you'll have to switch around a lot. My advice is to disable this in the options menu so you can move around freely and lock when you feel you like it.  And like always, whenever a game is awesome, we don't want the experience to end too soon. Zeno Clash 2 isn't short, it's about 8-9 hours long (including all sidequests), but still on the short side for an 'open world' game.  I had a great time playing it, and I truly hope ACE Team will earn enough money to give us a third game of this wonderfully realized world. We'll know in a few more years. In the meantime; buy this and show them your support.  [Rating: 87/100]",

By the way, about the sound, my favourite enemies are marauders, their faces covered with bag like masks, so they sounded like they shout into a pillow. Actually great effect, so energetic, so exprressive. Sometimes I just load game to fight them and to listen to them. Minuses: pretty linear, there is almost no choice. Also, some puzzles are just 'do the same several times' mixed with brawls. From the middle of the game you get some instruments to interact with environment, and you'll be confused whether you're able to interact with it or not. So, it's a good game. I had no intensions to play it actually, I don't rememer where I got it. However, I played it to the end!",

But the creativity behind it maybe left enough of an impression that I splurged on a sale for the sequel.  Regardless of the money, I don't feel playing through this game was time well spent. The world is bigger. It's less linear. There's more exploration and more characters. But those weren't problems that needed to be addressed or improved from the first game. It's like the developers focused on all the wrong things instead of working on any of the actual issues. The gameplay is still boring and limited and frustrating. The characters and the writing don't have any emotion in them, to say nothing of the flat, dull voice acting.  What did make me happy was the lore and history of the universe getting fleshed out. That was the best part by far. Inevitably, it was drowned out by the other elements, and we're left with a story not worth telling. The events of these games don't actually seem to affect any real change for either the characters or the world they reside in.  I have to give some props to the art direction. There are some beautiful moments of pure imagination. I'd probably buy some of these landscapes and levels as artwork. The problem is they're more fun to look at than to play through.",

It takes the worst of both of those elements with a confusing map with may off-limit or insta-kill areas and a levelling-up system which forces you to go on a treasure hunt rather than reward you for playing the game.  Zeno Clash 2 has forgotten what aspects made the original fun, i.e. punching wired humanoids, and layered that fun under too much that's new but poorly thought through or poorly implemented.  I just wanted to beat-on beings but I seem to be forced to wonder around instead.",

            "review_text": "Zeno Clash 2 is probably one of the most unique games I've ever played. It was a very strange and almost 'magical' experience from beginning to end, and the game progressively got both stranger and better. To summarize Zeno Clash 2, the game is basically a first-person brawler that takes place in a tribal acid trip. The game is entirely in first person (except for cutscenes, of course) including the combat, which is based upon stringing together combos and avoiding damage from enemies. There are also a few first-person shooting and puzzle-solving elements to the game that come into play at some parts. The controls felt tight, but the combo system was obtuse and the combat felt too simple, even with the additions to it that the player periodically acquires. While I will admit that the gameplay itself is kind of weak, it has some legitimately interesting mechanics, as well as a handful of gimmicks that, while gimmicks, were still interesting and fun to play around with. One thing that really bothered me about ZC2 is that you can't jump or crouch. I feel like the lack of a simple mechanic like a jump button reduces the depth the world (and therefore exploration) has, and was a lazy cop-out by the devs so that they wouldn't have to put invisible walls/barriers in places they didn't want players to get to. The highlights of Zeno Clash 2 are definitely the setting and art style. The setting is something very special in ZC2 as it is completely unlike anything I have ever encountered in a video game before. To best describe it, I would say that it was influenced by Morrowind and the Oddworld games, both of those being games with very unique and distinctive settings that ZC2 draws from in order to create something very unusual and interesting. There are great plains and mountains with strange creatures walking among them (my favourite being the 'ballsack shrimp', a species of walking dog-sized shrimp with its eyes hanging like testicles from its body), huge forests with mushrooms and trees the sizes of buildings, and ancient tombs with dark secrets, as well as the occasional pocket of civilization (more or less) here and there. It also reminded me of Star Wars/Dune at some parts, especially with the desert city at the beginning of the game. The atmosphere of the game is very bizarre and outlandish, but also quite strong. Every area feels different, and all of them have something that completely sets them apart from the others. This makes the world feel big - really big. It helps even that at one point, you get to see pretty much the entire continent (which you've been travelling across the whole game) before your own eyes. There's even a neat day-night cycle, and the time of day will change as you transition between places, making it feel as if you really did travel a long distance when you change zones. The writing and story of ZC2 are also better than I expected. The game has a decently detailed backstory, and it's subtly expanded on throughout the game via legends and characters that the player encounters. There's quite a few characters in the game, but none of them are given too much focus, except for Fathermother in the beginning and the Golems towards the end of the game. Indeed, the story in general isn't given much focus, although a few events did happen during the campaign that were interesting or unexpected from a writing perspective. Instead, the game is centred on exploration and backstory, which is something that develops more and more as the player covers more content. This increases the emphasis on sidequests and exploration, but allows the player to go through the game at their own speed. Overall, Zeno Clash 2 is quite an experience. While it's not exactly the paradigm of innovation or perfection in gameplay, I believe that the gameplay provides a decent canvas for the player to delve into the other, more unique aspects of the game. It's also fairly short, so I recommend this game for anyone who's looking for a game that's original without being pretentious or half-♥♥♥♥♥. Someday, I will play this game while high.",

It's a bit more narrative-heavy; you uncover the history of Zenozoik instead of wandering mostly aimlessly looking for fights, but the story is satisfying and the environment/character design is still satisfyingly weird.  Then again, there was a real appeal in zeno clash (1) in that nothing in the world had any sort of explanation. It was a weird place populated by weird people(?) doing weird things, and it was up to the player to just accept it. The setting I felt was diminished somewhat by making it (marginally) 'realer'.   Also the sun and moon gauntlet completely trivializes combat. Try to avoid using it.",

The 60 point metascore is completely wrong in my opinion, as the game is in a genre of its own, and thus really not for everyone. The only real gripe I have with it is that there is no challenge mode or arena thing like there was in the first game. The game also has a co-op mode.",

As far as the gameplay goes, I found the controls tricky (getting the right sequence of mouse clicks to pass the tutorial took me far more time than I'd like). Though it turned out that didn't matter anyway, as pressing both mouse buttons down at once to perform a double punch, followed by kicking my enemy once they were on the floor, did the trick most of the time.  The gun design is very intriguing, reminiscent of the weaponry in the film Videodrome. But firing the guns was mildly disappointing, to say the least: they have the same kind of effect as a child's popgun, both in terms of haptic feedback, sound and damage done to enemies. And they break after firing them about 4 times. I decided to stick to fists and feet.  I didn't play for long, but during the time I did, I didn't have a clue what was going on. Working out where to go next seemed next to impossible, and I got around mainly by chance. I wasn't really sure who anyone was, who I was, where I was, or where I was supposed to be going. The dialogue didn't help: it is extraordinarily difficult to follow, obtuse, bizarre, and poorly translated, with the quality of subtitles from a Chinese martial arts film translated by someone who speaks English as a second language. But charming nonetheless. I didn't play the first Zeno Clash, but I get the feeling that if I had, I would still not have a clue what was going on.  Despite all these flaws, I found it entertaining for an hour or so. The experience of playing it is kind of like being inside one of those avant garde Czech animations you sometimes see on TV at 3am, but with fighting.",

But the issue with Zeno clash 2 is the gameplay compared to its original.  Alot of the fighting mechanics have been generalized and arent as fast or tactical. You will find one combo and stick with it, while doing anything else is just style points. So if you are planning to play this, have fun kicking and smacking these weirdos. Dont think too much about being effective.  It may have lost a sense of accomplishment in its combat, but the game is alot bigger. I do think its the conversion from source engine to Unreal engine.  In anycase, it is a fun game but more worthwhile for the world and maybe co-op.",
