            "review_text": "5/10 I'm hesitant to recommend this game for a number of reasons. It's not worth its full price and is hardly worth getting at half price. I did enjoy the game, but I believe I got this for less than half price. Worth a consideration for 60% off or more.  Negatives: -Aside from the first 20% of the game, it feels like you are watching a sloppy brainstorm type proposal for a visual novel. It doesn't have much direction, and the direction it has is imprecisely dragged out, making a lot of the story repetitive and monotonous. You could say the limbo in the novel has realistic effects. In Sekai's defense, it is probably extremely difficult to get excitement out of a limbo concept -The same 5 or so backdrops are used for about half the novel -The music is not an enhancement to the novel at all. It sounds like filler, honestly. Other visual novels have mastered this while this one hugely underutilizes music -From the beginning the story is nonsensically depressing. Stories can be good and sad, but at times it honestly felt like I was reading about mysticized teen angst, and the suffering was mostly self-pity  Positives: -It is cute -The ending isn't extravagant but satisfying considering the quality of the story -If you don't need a story with progression and would be satisfied with just keeping company with mediocre characters for a few hours, it is entertaining -There are a handful of endearing moments between characters  I enjoyed it considering my discount and the fact that I had nothing else to do for like 4 hours. (lot of idle time recorded)",

            "review_text": "I like this game, but if you have no experience with this writer or visual novel in general, I won't recommend it. Go get Narcissu instead (It is free on steam by the same writer), and come back if you end up liking his style of writing.  To put it simple, it was a short and sad story about a girl becoming the lord of a never-end raining world. There wasn't too much happening with the plot. Rather, it was the mood that kept me reading. The male character was a depressed salary man, but that didn't affect the story. (The writer's other work, Sumire developed by nekoneko soft, incorporates the setting of a depressed salary man way better.) After finishing the game, you will unlock the bonus content, which is the full game of Narcissu 1 including an extra little chapter not in the free steam version.  I like the game music. It fits the sad and depressing story. The artwork is hm...I doubt if anyone can fap on it, but you never know. I bought the game when it was super cheap during summer sale, and it worths the money.",
