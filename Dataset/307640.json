            "review_text": "Stick RPG 2 has two different sides to the game. One side is a time management sim featuring wild goose chase quests, and the other side is a top down arcade brawler. Both sides completely different from each other, and both are necessary to master to complete the game.  As a sim, your character has to make money through working jobs, gambling, and performing various tasks. Doing favors (quests) for individuals will help you aquire different tools, which will ultimately lead you to the game goal items. As for time management, you have to decide what jobs and tasks are worth your time to work to build up your bank and character stats. You can also develop a love life interacting with potential mates. You also sometimes have a choice on how to accomplish certian tasks, but there are very few choices offered throughout the entire game.  As a top down arcade brawler, it feels very similar to Hotline Miami, but everyone has a life bar, and you can't pick up weapons off the ground. You can build weapons through quests, shop at the weapons store, or sometimes even win them as fight rewards. Some battles will only allow you to fight with your fists, but there are also battle grounds where you can exploit all your weapons.  As far as the overall experience goes, it feels really unpolished and unfinished. Prices of various items and services are very inflated, forcing you to spend a lot of time working jobs to develop a solid bank account. It is also frusturating working a job and losing stats on a bad shift (on the job accidents, with no insurance options). You also can have lucky days where you get a substantial bonus on your shift, but you can't adjust the odds in your favor for these events. On a funny note, your strength stat will make your firearms stronger for some reason, and you have unlimited ammo, so running blindly with a machine gun or flame thrower on full auto is an acceptable tactic. As fun as it is the first two or three times, it gets old really fast.  The game feels more like a prototype for something really awesome, but definitely lacks a lot of ambition, and needs to be tweaked. I do recommend it to hobbyist level game designers who want ideas for implementation, but need some direction. For everyone else, pick it up as cheap as you can (I got it for $1), and waste a good 4 to 6 hours before you give up on it. It isn't so bad, it just isn't all that great either.",

They were my primary source of flash games, I was even big on their forums and had a brief tenure as a moderator before I graduated and found better things to do.  I played SRPG1, 2, and a LOT of Stick Arena. I've been around.  I will say, immediately, that this is not a twenty dollar game. I find that quite a bit high for something that (probably) isn't even being worked on much anymore. I got it for four dollars, I'd put it's value at anywhere between 5-10$. So anything in that range or lower during one of Steam's various sales - I'd say nab it.  It's a simple game where you flail around four maps findings things to do. Slowly working up your cashflow, grinding out some stats that ultimately unlock more things to do. It's a neat distraction and functions as any browser-based flash game would. A simple distraction before work, or something to do with Netflix on the side. It's simple and fun, and there's not too much left to say.",

You can own a business, become head of every job, etc. The game is good if you liked flash games back in the day. Combat is fun, purely action based and can be challenging at times.

            "review_text": "Back in 2007-ish Stick RPG was one of the best games that has ever been developed by XGen Studios. Though fairly simple and short, Stick RPG was a great game for its time. However, when Stick RPG 2 came out, it has improved upon evry aspect of the previous game.In case you might not have known, there are two versions of the game; There's the free browser version and the 'expanded' Steam version. Though both have similar features, the director's cut gives you access to another area to explore, more jobs, full access to cheats that you would otherwise have to pay seperately for, etc( All the info is in the game's description I'll make it simple and list off the pros and cons of this game:  Pros: -Combat plays similarly to Stick Arena: Ballistic (A game also developed by XGen Studios) which is not perfect but not bad at all either - A VAST number of jobs to choose from and max out -Several weapons at your disposal with varying ranks and tiers -each job has a certain benefit that sometimes can be useful -'Moral' game (game let's you to either pick the good path or bad path)  Cons -There are times where it stutters a little while transitioning to another area or to combat mode -Relationship feature is a bit lacking -Prices are a tad bit too high  Verdict: 8.9/10; This game serves to be a pretty fun time waster/RPG game. Though some aspects of the game are a bit annoying, you might not bother to notice it when you're strolling around the city, boosting your stats, and beating the living bejeezus out of each and every foe. If Stick RPG 3 is a possible thing in the future, I hope that XGen Studios can improve on making it even better than this installment. ",
