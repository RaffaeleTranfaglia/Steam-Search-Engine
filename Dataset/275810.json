            "review_text": "Well, it's a 'match-3' as they were made a decade ago. Graphics are crude/cheap when compared to today's standards. Still the genre may appeal to some players, like it does to me. As the title says, the goal is to contruct wonders by retrieving stones from background you have to break. There are 7 wonders and each wonder has 7 levels. Each level must be cleared. At wonder 4 or 5, some background tile are doubled. As bonus blocks, it is the usual : 4 block align, 5 block align and every 4 bonus used, another bonus appears, this one destroying several tiles+backgound at random. That's the extend of this game, which I finished in two hours. Once done, you can do a rerun, but with (unselectable) harder difficulty. Oh, and expect a lot of 'no more move' in this one. Thankfully, it's not at your expense as it redraws the screen freely when that happens. On a playability note, once you move a tile, you can't move any other until the screen has settled. That means that all raws cleared because of your move must happen and you cannot do anything until it's done.  I rank this as a difficult one, mainly because of the few varied bonuses. Some tiles are really hard to reach.  Last, I installed this on Win7 and it ran without problem. Although, mind the resized screen for any other app that may run in the background :)",

            "review_text": " Brief Synopsis :  7 Wonders of the Ancient World is a casual tile matching game where in you 'build' the 7 wonders of the world by matching lines of 3 or more of the same shape. Doing so breaks the tiles behind them. Break all the tiles on the board to proceed to the next board. There are 7 levels in the game, each consisting of several sub levels. In total, the main game took me about 3 hours to play through.   Long Review    Story : The story in this game is pretty flimsy, but in a nutshell, you supervise the building of the 7 wonders of the ancient world. You do this by creating blocks (done by breaking tiles on the board) and moving cornerstones down the board (done by matching shapes) for the workers to collect.    Graphics : The graphics are pretty standard fare for a casual matching game. They're simple and, with the exception of the workers, fairly static.    Music/Sounds : By far, the best part of this game, in my humble opinion, is the music. It's rather catchy, and despite it playing in a constant loop, it didn't get tiring or turn me homicidal (always a good thing).    Length : I was able to get through all 7 wonders in about 3 hours, managing to get the second highest title reward in the game. For Â£5, this is a bit short for my liking.   Replayability : Carrying on from above, 3 hours isn't really a good length for the cost of the game. The game does allow you to go back to previously completed levels to try to get a better score, so it is slightly replayable.   I do tend to enjoy matching games and find them to be quite relaxing. As such, my recommendation, if you are the same as I, is to get this game when it goes on sale at more than 50% off. ",
