            "review_text": "This is a game for lovers of mazes, block-pushing and item manipulation. It is a puzzle game based on the old BBC &amp; Amiga XOR maze challenge for anyone who may remember it from years ago. For those who don't remember XOR think Repton, Boulderdash, Chips Challenge but with emphasis on forward planning to solve the puzzles.  The graphics are really nice and well animated and the levels are challenging once you have completed the tutorial and maze sections.  There is no level editor sadly (but maybe the Developer will add one?) which is a shame as there is so much potential here!  All in all a very good puzzle game with retro styled mechanics which provide a good challenge.",
