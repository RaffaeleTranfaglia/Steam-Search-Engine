            "review_text": "This game has a lot of polish and attention to detail, but a few things keep it from being a must play.   It seems to suffer from 'I designed the levels so I know where everything is' syndrome. Secret parts of the level that you discover by repeatedly bumping into walls (while every move is counted against your 'grade' at the end). An unknown number of scientists to be rescued. Hit the exit too early? Aww you missed those 4 scientists who were missing and we didn't tell you about.   No checkpoints, no saving. If you want to play a level and not have to repeat any part of it (they are broken into 3 stages), you must play it completely. I suppose this wouldn't be so bad but the levels do feel like a chore after the first time through.  Speaking of which, the absolute worst design choice was the very last level. It took what enjoyment I had found in the game, threw it in the dirt and used its cloven hoof to ground it into non-existence. Finishing became a chore instead of a goal.  I feel like the game changed its personality mid way through. At the beginning, we learned the mechanics of the game, Everything moved like clockwork, see, plan out your moves well! Then we run into some elements that aren't bound by this rule, hmmm.. curious but we can work around it, and even use it to our advantage. Soon enough, there's fires raging, enemies exploding, and immunity from step-time seems to be a crutch that the game uses to ramp up difficulty. There are times when they teach you about a elements and enemies and there are others where they kill you to teach you and you restart the level.  There are some clever puzzles that make use of the elements and weapons in the game. I think that was the most satisfying part for me, but as the game evolved it became less enjoyable.  All in all, great graphics, sounds, controls. The levels are well designed and I didn't run into any game breaking bugs that forced me to restart a level. However, lack of checkpoints or free saving and repetition seem to be a way to artificially extend the play time, particularly on the last level.  6/10 - pick it up on sale.",

            "review_text": "I got the game in April's Humble Bundle Monthly, so I did not pay full price by any means. I had some enjoyment with the game. The mechanics work out fine and it is some kind of action-strategic-puzzle game. You maneuver your ship turnwise. It sounds weird, but with each turn, your enemies move as well, so it is not comparable with a Pokemon game or Civilization by any means. It plays out conveniently and the idea is nice. There is no story though (until now) and only once in a while a sentence of dialogue at best while you are rescuing a scientist or the game introduces a new game mechanic to you - whether a weapon or a hostile target. This game feels like a PC game but suits a phone a lot better. You do the same thing over and over with a few twist and turns maybe, a new enemy type or so. The game works well and looks really nice, but I doubt I will play this a lot longer. 15 bucks would not be worth it in my opinion.",

Cute visuals, up-beat music, quirky dialogue, and a casual game experience make the game good for the casual crowd. Not too difficult and the mechanics get a little repetitive after awhile, but overall a fun experience.",

            "review_text": "Nova-111 is an excellent puzzle game with some really fun innovations to a pretty stale genre. If you like old-school 2D puzzle games like Adventures of Lolo, then this is for you. At first, Nova-111 seems like a typical turn-based puzzle game on a grid. But quickly you learn that some elements in the environment are in realtime. For example, you have to juggle turn-based enemies with realtime laser turrets. This makes for some very fun maneuvering. At first, all your ship can do is bash into enemies, but as the game progresses you gain some additional abilities like a smart bomb and a teleport gun that lets you move two squares in one turn. (And more powers that are better left a surprise.) Overall the game is not very difficult but if you want to save every scientist and find every secret area (while also minimizing your damage and number of moves) then you can make yourself a real challenge. The enemies are fun and varied with interesting patterns to memorize. Not to mention a lively sense of humor and polished art style. Recommended for puzzle lovers!",

This is one of the games that will probably be dominating my summer.",
