            "review_text": "I'm no expert at games like this, and obviously I haven't put that many hours into the game yet since I just got it. However, I will try to explain why I fell in love with this game at first sight (from an analytical point of view).   Side note : I'll be honest, I was reluctant to buy this at first simply due to the price and even found myself regretting the decision once I opened up that CC menu, but it was indeed worth it and I'll explain why later.  At first glance this game doesn't look like much. Just another dumb 2d flash game, right? That's what I thought. The first time I loaded up the game as a knight I wasn't expectig the damn near perfect swinging animations from my sword. Almost every good thing about this game took me by surprise. I was blown away by the amount of production value and time and effort that's just so apparent in every corner in the first few starting areas.    THE COMBAT   The combat is lovely and fluid and beautiful. It's everything I could ask for in a hack and slash rpg because unlike in Dark Souls you can perform Air Combos and finish off with a powerful downward strike which obliterates your enemies into a mesmerizing spray of red liquid. The enemy/boss ai works well to keep you on your toes and wastes no time punishing your mistakes and trying to put you in inconvenient positions. I got ♥♥♥♥ed up several times by The Sodden Knight (First boss) yet, had I known that you could roll that probably wouldn't have happened quite as much.   LEVEL DESIGN  Verticality is a must in 2d plat formers like SaS and it goes all out with the vast amount of detail packed into every area and the subtle creaks and croaks of old, moldy wood as you step on a board that may even give away underneath you due to pressure. The pick ups and drops are all easily attainable and don't divide into the action too much with long, tedious 'bend-over' animations. For once the developers decided to make it less of a fetching task to retrieve your lost currency (in this case 'Salt') in a Souls game. And, they did it by making a beast out of your salt which you have to kill every time you want to get your salt back. Otherwise, if you die again, as suspected, you permanently lose those piles of salt you worked so hard to attain and have to start all over from 0. Luckily to retrieve salt from a boss you don't have to kill him all the way. Just take his health down to a certain point.   SOUND DESIGN  Sound is a wonderful thing in this game, any game for that matter. It adds to the authenticity of being able to imagine these places. Hearing things adds levels of atmosphere to a setting. The rapid splashes of rain and mist and the sound of wind blowing through grassy fields gives the game that flavour; sells the vibe. I can't wait to get back into the world every time I hear that, it's amazing.  The music on the otherhand, even if there's little of it, is pretty good. Although it's very minimalist music, the background ost does well to add some tension throughout the areas you encounter. The boss fights are all made very epic with the addition of those fantastic chords. I believe there are like 2 boss fight tracks and 2 background tracks: In total 4 songs which shouldn't be too much of a problem given that the rest of the game is a masterpiece.   ART/VISUAL DESIGN  Last but not least we have the visuals. As I mentioned before, the visual effects of the blood spraying look absolutely mesmerizing. Some other visually stunning achievements would be the heat distortion near the torch flames and what not. It's always the little things like that which get my attention. Also, despite the mildy childish and cartoonish look of the world and it's characters, there is a certain level of realism to it all and I've come to like that a lot about it. Especially in the darkest areas is where the game's art direction can really stand out. It's so unique and interesting.  All in all this game is great because it was made well. A couple of glances on the surface don't mean much with gameplay this brilliant it will definitely have you hooked for hours no matter what your experience with rpg's is. I did my best to try and avoid references to Dark Souls and the like. Now I should probably stop typing because I've been typing this review for about an hour and a half now and I have exams.",

An adequate port thus far with no obvious issues.  As for the gameplay it is the lovechild of 'insert From Software title here* and *insert metroidvania title here*. There are no huge mechanical twists to be found.  That said, what it does, Salt does well. The combat is tight and brutal, and the platforming is snappy and satisfying partly due to a ledge-grab mechanic.  The art style is nothing to write home about. Adverage indie-title quality, with some personality of it's own.   tl;dr  It's a Souls clone. But it is faithful to the source material and fun.  Art: 6/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Port: 10/10 Overall: 8/10",

Sanctuaries act as hubs for leveling up (which is done by collecting 'salt' from enemies), branching your skill tree, and talking with vendors. Tech Tree is locked so choose skills/abilities wisely. Losing salt when you die makes death a consideration when chosing to battle enemies who might be stronger than you. This lends itself to somewhat of a grind for salt/leveling up at the begininng of the game but the grind is just enough to let you get a feel for controls. I used my Xbox One controller in lieu of a mouse/keyboard and it works great - would highly recommend going this route. The different character classes seem to offer lots of great replayibility.",

The graphics and particularly the animations are well executed, especially after parries. The subsequent reposte is always brutal and elicits the same feeling you get in DS.   I see other reviews that mention they are trying to avoid the comparison, but I think this is a love letter to those games. They captured both the aesthetics and the gameplay mechanics, yet it has a unique flavor of its own. The only thing it's missing for me is true multiplayer (internet), but that's a minor complaint.",

Beautifully crafted, with massive world, ton of items and very entertaining gameplay. Basically, you get Dark Souls in 2D world, with almost exact same game mechanics, such as stamina-based combat, brutal difficulity and great scenarios. Also, platforming side of game is very nicely made, almost on level of old PSX Castelvania. Definitely recomended to everyone.",

            "review_text": "Definitely one of my new favorite games and easily the best platformer i've ever played. I went into this game expecting an homage to dark souls and i got that and so much more. the combat system, the salt used for levelling up and upgrading equipment, the sparse story told through item descriptions and npc interactions...it's jsut so lovely and perfect. the many sanctuaries around the world that can be upgraded with various npcs that provide various services as well as area bonuses. like dark souls, salt and sanctuary has something like covenants (called creeds) that you can level up in and collect bonuses from. the skill tree is massive and reminds me of path of exile's humungous skill tree. regardless of your starting class, salt and sanctuary allows you to create a fully customizable character that can be proficient in anything. i really like the branding system. i've only found 2 'brands' so far, but one allows me to use certain obelisks to reverse gravity in certain areas and walk on the ceiling. the other allows me to jump off walls. i'm sure there are more out there and i'm curious to see how they help me progress through the world. the 2D platforming nature of salt and sanctuary combines with the branding system to allow for more vertical gameplay than dark souls could pull off. i also really like the way you can unlock shortcuts between the sanctuaries and that there are even little hidden checkpoints that act like sanctuaries and restore your health/potions while on the way to certain bosses. the 2D nature also gives a certain advantage to the bosses in that they only have to attack in one of 2 directions. it adds a certain level of challenge to not being able to dodge left or right, but only forward and back. the many different weapons have their own attack patterns that add some depth to the combat and the fact that you can transmute them into other, potentially more powerful weapons is pretty amazing. all in all, i can honestly say that i like this game as much as the souls games. if you like dark souls and platformers, don't wait-just get it. the only downside to this game is that there's no multiplayer. but there's local co-op, which is almost as good.",

Maybe I'm unlucky, but I've come to many garbage short comings in dark souls, and S&amp;S is no differnet. Both games have their bugs, though dark souls has much more in my experience. Now don't get me wrong, I love dark souls I've played the first for 150 hours and the third for 300 hours, the second... like 40, but I'm not here to talk about how much I love Dark Souls. I'm here to debunk alot of these negative review complaints.  Git gud.  In all seriousness, people have complained about the dodge mechanic. Yeah, it's not easy to use, but it's not easy in dark souls 2. You learn how to make it effective. I've made a character that can dodge everything; once you understand the mechanic it becomes very easy. Folks have also complained about the blocking, in which I rebutle with, 'What?' if anything, the blocking is overpowered. Some have argued against the skill tree, but they don't provide enough info on why they hate it; the skill tree system seem pretty good to me. Some one eve complained about stamina, just raise you're willpower, that increase stamina. others have complained about health, which raises through overall level and not alot. If you wanna tank get some solid armor and upgrade it, at nearly 300 hp I can soak a ♥♥♥♥ load of damage with heavy armor. Another complaint is that you can't finish the game with starting gear, I disagree. People have also said that the keyboard controls are ♥♥♥♥♥, yee they are, but you can rebind them to fit your needs. My last point is that the game isn't even that hard. I had a harder time in the first Dark Souls.  So to close my stupid rant with, Git Gud. Seriously, if this game is hard for these negative reviewers that say, 'Dark Souls is difficult but fair, S&amp;S is unfair in it's difficult' than I have no Idea how you even finished Dark Souls. This is not more difficult the Dark Souls. To me both have been unfair in it's difficulty and I love them both for it.  Edit: if you don't like platforms you may want to consider you're options more than those who like them or don't mind them, though I hope that would go without saying. Personally I hate platforms, but this game is amzing, plus I have loyalty to Ska Studios, I've loved their games for a while. only platforms I ever play: Dish Washer was good, Vampire Smile was good, ZP2K9 and ZP2KX where Amazing, and I Made A Game With Zombies In It was hilarious but also not a platformer.",

Each swing of your sword/whip/hammer/reaper/axe/spear will go through it's full animation before you can do anything else. You can't just spam attack as it will leave you open for attacks.

Medium version: Buy this game if you like Metroidvanias and/or Dark Souls.  Full Version: This game is too awesome. Yes, I mean 'too' awesome, as I want to continue playing it even though I need to go to bed. I want to play it when I'm at work and I want to play it when I'm playing other games.  I'm a big fan of Metroidvanias and I think I have a fairly high standard when it comes to them. Any old game with the basic elements won't do. The only games in the genre that really stand out for me are Super Metroid, Axiom Verge and Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. That's not to say I haven't enjoyed any others, but these are the ones that set the bar for me. Salt &amp; Sanctuary is easily in the same league as the mentioned games and I will be recommending it to people for years to come, I am sure.  So you have probably heard that S&amp;S is basically 2D Dark Souls. It has many of the elements; classes, branching upgrades, geography that gradually unlocks and loops back into itself, no map, stamina, parrying, etc. Don't be fooled into thinking it is purely a derivitive work though. Obviously S&amp;S is inspired by Dark Souls, but it has enough elements to give it its own style and flavour.  If you haven't played Dark Souls then just know that this game is hard and requires patience. The combat feels responsive, but you cannot just go in blindly mashing. Even basic enemies can kill you quite easily if you let them surround you or get a full combo on you. You have to learn each enemies behaviour and then adapt. This makes the combat really satisfying; an enemy that you think is really hard eventually becomes easy (easier?) and there's always a fresh challenge as new enemies appear. There are loads of weapons, spells and items you can use to customise your character and different weapons have different move sets.   I mentioned there is no map and at first I thought I was going to be in for a tough time as my sense of direction is terrible (even in games). So far it hasn't really been a problem for me and early into the game you gain the ability to fast travel if you find yourself lost, although I actually haven't used it yet. The way the world gradually opens up means you will likely be familiar with any given area before it starts to connect to other areas so confusion should be minimal. I have no idea the full size of the world, but the area I have explored so far feels bigger than the whole of Momodora 4 (great game regardless) and I expect there is still a significant chunk I haven't seen based on various impassable doors and things I have seen.  Anyway, I could go on for ages, but there's no point. There are countless videos and essentially if anything I've said appeals to you, you should just buy the game right now. You won't regret it and if you do, there's always the refund option.",

Great work especially for such a small dev team.  I feel like I have to adress that at first glance it may seem like a clone of dark souls, but in my opinion it's in many regards superior to it. The platforming is immensly better compared to the often forced and imprecise platforming in the souls series, the parry timing is clearer (partial parries aren't a death sentence, like in DS3), the mechanics behind reclaiming your experience are better designed, the level up system is fairly unique (though reminiscent of the Sphere Grid from FFX) and other things.  There are some problems of course, like questionable hitboxes (e. g.    Red Lord's followup attack, Queen of Smiles' spinning attack    and some weapon ranges), the content gets slightly diluted towards the end of the game (the areas seem emptier, though that enhances the atmosphere as well), for souls veterans the different take on rolling might be frustrating (minimal i-frames, requires you to roll through enemies), the parry timing is perhaps a little to lenient and some item descriptions are somewhat lackluster.  Recomended for fans of the 2D Castlevania games (SotN, AoS, DoS, PoR, OoE, ... ) and the souls series, just remember that this is a standalone game, with plenty of its own mechanics and quirks.",

            "review_text": "Some games cause rash. A rash you can not scratch. And when you don't get more of the scratch to the itch that plagues you, you end up sitting in a dirty street, cooking up a bottle of Jenkem over a burning trash can, injecting it into your worn out cockvein. This is not a review about a game that helps you, but one that only makes you just a little more broken.  Salt and Sanctuary is a strange game. Many people say this is the lovechild of Dark Souls and Castlevania: Symphony of the knight. I beg to differ in this judgement. After playing and completing this game I can say that this felt more to me like a mixture of ghost's n' goblins regarding the visual athmosphere, mixed with a platforming experience close to Ninja Ga(y)iden and a combat system like final fight, all dipped into a semi deep RPG manager with a rather large world you need to explore without any map whatsoever.  Apparently this game was created by a 2 man development team consisting of 2 brothers. That is to say rather impressive. The last game with such a small dev team I played was Dust:Elysian tale. And coincidently it was an Action RPG like this. Seems like those are a go-to place for Indie devs. Not complaining though, at least not about those 2. Well, maybe a little. This game has no story, and what little of rudimentary tropes there are fly directly out of the window the second the game finishes the tutorial sequence with a supposingly impossible boss fight against everybodys favourite tentacle monster, never to be seen ever again.  A thing I have to give Salty Sanctuary is, that it appears to be a highly customizeable game. You can play a caster, a ranger or a knight, even with slight variations inbetween each class competently, resulting in a completely different game experience. That, and limiting yourself even more if you wish to a no-magic mode, nude mode, or even if you so desire (no idea why you wanted to but hey) a permadeath mode.  I played this game like so many other on PC with keyboard and mouse while my character was a medium armored knight with a big weapon. I refused to use magic and was able to conquer the thing without ever using a shield. Not gonna lie here, the first 1 or 2 hours into the game were so bad that i contemplating requesting a refund for this. For some reason the menu management is really bothersome. When i tried to acces different screens or option menues those windows usually closed when i tried to browse them. Almost anytime when i was trying to use the mouse, the game refused to register the clicks or blended the mouse out of the screen, which caused me to end up more then once buying several units of items not in one stroke, but buying them one by one, sometimes several dozens. It sucked. The presence of of monetary currency that is not 'Souls' left me dumbfounded, as many of the items you can buy for money stop being useful 2 hours into the game. Next time just say each and everthign for salt.  The combat system is fittingly deep. You can chain weapon combat of smaller arms together and juggle opponenets around while big weapons usually oblitere them in one strike. The combat is meaty, full of blood and explosions. Quite fun. Dishonorable mention: The hitboxes. This game has one of the worst problems with hitboxes I have ever seen in a game. It's even worse than Dark Souls 2. Usually it's enough not to hit the enemy, but the thin air before him. Many enemies have difficulties judging your attack reach as well. This is all topped of with an almost useless dodge roll that has no invincibiliy frames whatsoever. You can still manage to win the game with it only, I am the living proof of that, but its more difficult than it needs to be and the utility is just not present in the same magnitude as you would expect it for a game that is shamelessly dickriding on the success of dark souls. Some of the bossfight were either also flat out boring or ridicously imbalanced (With one or two of them so much dysfunctional that I am willing to give a golden ♥♥♥♥♥ award for one of the most broken ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bossfights in my entire life), but honestly said, the combat with those is rather mixed up most of the time and you can tell that the dev trieds really hard to make the frequent boss battles as interesting as the limitations of a 2D engine would humanly allow. So I am willing to forgive that. With the exceptions of Bosses stealing Souls and not giving it back when you defeat them. That needs to change.  What little music is in the game is pretty nice. It fit's the athmospere of the game and sometimes even gave me flashbacks to ye good old diablo 2, when you listen to guitars being stringend at the sight of some nicely piled up corpse mountains. However, therein lies the problem. There is not enough music. At all. When i finished my first playthrough i felt like i only listened to maybe 6 tracks, excluding a brief and exclusive track for the final level and the unique theme for the final boss. Here's hoping if there will ever be a S&amp;S2, that it has a significant bigger track library. Hopefully even with NPC voiceacting, because that is sadly missing as well.  Overall visual design of S&amp;S deserves praise. It's very good, with a small exceptions. The enemies, bosses, weapons and armor designs are top notch. There's a lot of them and they are all clearly distinguishable from oen another. Given some of them are flat out stolen from other games and rebranded, but they all look nice, faithful to the golden age of videos games in the 16 bit era. The Player characters and friendly NPC's do not get a cut from that cake. They are flat out ugly and look like anorexic deformed aborted cat fetuses, You can customize them but thats like putting a pig dress and painting it with make Up. It remains a pig, no matter how you look at it. This goes as far that some of the characters even get grossly distorted eye disabilities as if there was an invisible carrot floating over their head that genuinely freaked me out the first time I saw them. Luckyly you don't have to endure that for long, once you get a full encased helm to shield your eyes from the butt ugly mug of your toon, so that you have a splendid time exploring the dark and depressing dreadful landscapres to their fullest extend. I would say that the world feels, just like dark souls 2, like an amusement park of atrocities, but the well connected and vastly different from each other levels actually do make sense within the content of the game. No spoilers though.  The game is surprisingly big for it's price. To the point where I wondered how many more hidden corridoors the devs could have put behind gated walls. If you like exploring, you will like this a great deal. Not explicitly the most difficult 2D game I have ever played, as the nature of a grindy action rpg bites itself in the ♥♥♥ the more knowlegdeable and skillful you get and your gear advances. But thats what NG+ is for.   If you like a RPG game with considerable jump-run episodes, above averge difficulty with reward-faktor of if you like to insert some nasty burning ♥♥♥♥ into your urethra from time to time, you can consider this pleasantly presented brawler with a price tag below 20 Euros as recommended. Remember: Winners don't take drugs. Except Jenkem. That's 100% natural. Good Evening. ",

The brands are a nice addition to the formula as I like the added flexibility to the movement of the character.  The game is full of shortcuts between areas, but you will almost never use them as you can just blow a horn to go back to any sanctuary you like. The boss fights are decent, many of which involve figuring out what resistance to wear and what the boss is weak against, then provide a beat down. I like that the bosses have phases that increase the difficulty as the fight goes on, some of which make the fight a lot more tense.

Regardless, Salt &amp; Sanctuary is a beautifully visual and ambitious game that does indeed take a lot of its inspirations from the Dark Souls games.  Having recently gotten into the Souls games myself, the controls do take a bit of getting used to. But once that's squared away, it's easy to see just how well the Souls influence affects S&amp;S in just the right way. A prime example is dying and losing your salt, thinking 'Alright, I'm just going to rush there, get my salt back, and get back to my sanctuary', and then getting skwered by spawning bandits and attack dogs (I'm not bitter at my stupidity, I swear).  The visual asthetic is a little muddy when things get close and I sometimes miss bottles and salt on the ground, and I wish there was an easier eye-catching jump between picking up an item and seeing what it is off to the side, but that's a personal gripe and as with the controls one gets used to it over time and it becomes easier to see. The addition of a skill tree helps easily visualize what build one wishes to go for. The sound and ambiance is quiet and foreboding. A trademark of Ska Studios alongside the visceral juiciness of blood and blades, the music and tone is well-played throughout the game (so far, in my case) and the boss music is appropriately tense and reactive to the situation in comparison. Executing an enemy has a satisfying SQUELCH and even opening bottles sounds weirdly gratifying. Storywise, there isn't much. There's text in the beginning to give some opening composition, but it's brief and gets the subtly gets the point across that the story may not matter all that much.   The game is deep, beautiful, and lavished with evidence that this was made by Dark Souls fans, for Dark Souls fans. With Ska Studios's signature elements and talent, this is the best of both worlds and highly recommended. Even if I am a biased fan.",

I highly recomend this game to fans of the Metroidvania genere and Dark Souls series, and even people who are fans of modern rpgs like Dragon Age or The Witcher who looking for something new.  The art style is intentionally bleak at first, grey hopelessness and undead enemies paint the dreary shoreline with woe as the enemies shamble about... then you enter a dark cave. The fog is  gone , there is no grainy filter anymore, the color is vivid and everything pops, it's jarring, it's frighting, and it's beautiful. Each area of the game has it's own themes, and even the horrifying places like   The Red Hall of Cages  , while spattered with gore, are beautifully and thoughtfully done.  The enemies are tough, but you get visibly stronger as you level yourself and your weapons up, and when combined with responsive controls, you get revenge on tough enemies pretty quickly. Leveling up seems daunting at first, but with a little research, you'll find a goal near the end of a tree, and map out a handy path of upgrades.   Salt and Sanctuary is also pretty build heavy. If you're interested in doing well in this game, I'd recommend doing some reading while the game downloads and installs. There's all kinds of weapons, armors, and styles of magics to specialize in. You also choose a creed as you play (think Dark Souls covenants) and these decide which sanctuaries (bonfires) you have available to upgrade and what kind of equipment is available to you. Furthermore, each of those sacnctuaries has 4 upgrade slots, so you have to think about what to upgrade the sanctuaries with as I have yet to find a way to undo the upgrades.   Bosses are a big part of the game, they are unforgiving and require keen observation to recognize very punishing attacks. If you are stuck on a boss, you are stuck because you are not good enough. Luckily, you can get good outside on those tough enemies, and it feels less like grinding when you're fighting for your life in some of the later areas.   Just like the Souls series, while the bosses drop loot and lots of experience (or salt as it's called), the real reward is catharsis. When I beat one boss I was stuck on for hours, I beat him because I leveled up my greatsword a few times, and leveled up a few times more. I didn't just win, I whooped him. At first I was only doing 4-5% of his health per attack, and I couldn't find many opportunities to attack, after some dramatic frustration and leveling up, I was carving away huge chuncks of health, unconcerned about his attack. It was a very  visceral  kind of success, and that describes what this game is well.",

It has platforming, and I love it! Compared to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t platforming of Charlie Murder, this game is amazing. It makes all platforming satisfying, and any mistakes you make are your own once you get the engine down. I noticed someone complained about lots of platforming around deathpits, and there's two or three areas that force you to do that. The biggest issue I had was with a couple of the bosses, who were really cheap, until I found out their sweet spots for dodging. I'd like to thank the developers for putting so much love into this game. Comparing this to my time in the Dark Souls games, I much enjoy this more even though the only online function was the message bottles.",

            "review_text": "I like this game. It's fun, it's worth your time and your money. Comparisons to Dark Souls is inescabable, but this game really has far more in common with classic Metroidvania's than it does the souls series and. Imagine an inferior Symphony of Night with Dark Souls levelling system and enemies who can kill you in a few hits and you've got a decent idea of what you are in for.  Positives are the game is beautiful, the combat feels meaty and appropriately visceral. When you smash the living crap out of a zombie you really feel it through the screen and the abundance of gore and sound design. You kinda have to play it to really appreciate how bloody satisfying it is to crush your enemies and watch the body parts fly across the screen while the screen shudders with your power. It's glorious. The level design is also interesting, not quite the masterpieces that are classic metroidvanias but varied and packed full of varied environments and enemies that challenge you in different ways.   The problem comes from the fact that most of the game's 'difficulty' comes from bad platforming (there's a reason there is no platforming in Dark Souls, playing this game will make you fully comprehend why they didn't even include proper jumping in the Souls series) and enemies/bosses whose attacks are wildly different than their sprites and animations. You can definately appreciate the meticulous way Souls bosses are designed to be tough but fair while playing this game, where bosses can sometimes string together unavoidable death-combos, meaning that there is a significant element of luck to beating them. It might take several tries to clear a boss, not because of skill, but just because if whatever RNG determines which attacks they do happens to hit a certain order there is practicly nothing you can do to survive.  Anyway, In DS when I die it always feels fair or earned, here you just roll your eyes the 10th time miss some jump and fall to your death. In a game where dying can potentially cost you hours of progress in terms of Salt(souls), it feels like a pretty poor decision to put so many 'make this jump or die' segments. The game is full of them, especially towards the end, and it's a problem. For every death to an enemy I think I had 5 deaths to just bloody falling off some ledge that my character decided they weren't going to grab this time, or when my air-dash move just decided not to go off. It's frusterating and makes you understand exactly why there is no platforming in Dark Souls.   The plot makes no sense whatsoever, and I never really felt like I was being guided along a journey. The designers really adopted the minimalist story design of DS, but they didn't seem to realize that DS does a ton of world building and storytelling through the visuals, gameplay, and the overall layout of the game. You always feel like you have a direction and a goal in Dark Souls. Here I'm just kinda going from area to area killing bosses who I have no clue about or why they even exist or really what I'm doing aside from a vague 'save the princess' mission that I still don't fully understand.    TL:DR? Flawwed but fun game. Get it if you are a fan of either Dark Souls or Metroidvanias (but especially the latter) but be prepared to deal with some occasional poor design.   ",

It provided a enjoyable difficulty. It was never extremely frustrating or difficult.   The game has a skill tree; no abilities in the tree but there are different armor/weapon tiers, attributes upgrades, and expanded potion slots to be obtained.   Beat it in about 9 hours with a greataxe/warhammer most of the game. I even considered playing it again.

All the core mechanics are here: Range, melee, magic builds and hybrids, stamina management, equipment/weight management, fashion, and my beloved parrying to name a few so I felt right at home. I love the tweaks they made to this system as well, you get 2 weapon sets to adjust, and when one is equipped, the other doesn't effect your weight. Also parrying animations are legit and can distance other opponents. There are different combos you can perform from standard X, X, X ground combo to X,Y,(X or Y repeated) air combos. Using magic is really satisfying as well in my experience whether you need to zone or distance yourself.  Initially I didn't feel very drawn in to the world until I discovered that this game has something no other souls game has. Something I hold very dear to my heart and is becoming harder to find in any games these days. That thing is local co op. I had already played an hour before my older brother picked up the sticks and joined me, so I made a new mage/dex build while he went holy knight. We have been hooked ever since, I love how dynamic our methods in fighting can become as we increase our abilities to crush our foes. There is just nothing like playing along side a sibling or good friend in a game that requires both of you to always be on your toes. It is harder with two people and that is just the way we want it.  Now I haven't been exposed to Metroid or Castlevania so I can't use those as reference, but I love the way maps are designed for platforming, moving up and down, it all feels really smooth. Exploration is great as your field of view won't show you everything and you never know what you will find next. If my brother would die late in a stage's progression, I would have to make a choice to either return to a sanctuary and revive him or keep moving forward hoping I find a new one. Sometimes I found one, sometimes I came across a boss who wanted nothing more than to rip me to shreds. Oh and bosses have more than 1 phase like Dark Souls 3/Bloodborne.  All in all I highly recommend this game co op or not, it makes you work for success, and feel like a total badass while you do it. We are still learning a lot and have a long way to go, and I can definitely see the replay value this game has to offer. I give Salt and Sanctuary 3 thumbs up, 5 gold stars, and a burrito from your favorite mexican restaurant.",

And, I LOVE Bloodborne (more than Souls) - perfect mixture of the platforming genre with the action-RPG genre! I strongly recommend picking this one up!

Directions can get sketchy sometimes if you're easily disoriented or checking out a new area for the first time without realizing that it borders another previously explored area. Still, the map is pretty well laid out, and even without using fast transport, walking from anywhere to anywhere else isn't too punishing.  I wish there was a respec option. Even with a penalty, being able to try new builds without starting a wholly different character would be very much appreciated. Still, the flexibility of the tree is nice - reminiscent of FFX's sphere grid. The little bits of lore on each node are nice too, for those who enjoy that kind of thing.  A word of caution: some NPCs give quests that cannot be continued if the NPC isn't found and chat options exhausted before fighting the area boss. This can also happen in some rare cases where bosses may be fought out of 'order.' Just check the wiki perhaps, if completion in this manner is important. Winning the game and building properly are not dependent upon it though, so it's more a matter of collecting all the acheivements, lore, and crafting mats.",

Specially because mobs don't have a pattern and they can just do batshit crazy combos out of nowhere. As it seems some of them don't even have stamina so they can spam their attacks and block as much as they want. I think in games like these, mobs have to be similar to the player in general like they must have similar pros or cons. While you cant even block anything properly, a mob in the begining can take hit after another without even a scratch and attacks and blocks like he doesn't have stamina at all.  I'm really hoping that my opinions are like this because I just started the game but I think I'm kinda familiar to this type of games so I think I'm not completely wrong about my observations. By the way, I already beat the first boss and reached the second so I don't think I am a bad player)      ",

            "review_text": "Holy Sh*t, this game... You try it for the first few minutes and you instantly fall in love with it. Salt and Sanctuary is basicly a game inspired by darksouls, But in 2D. The gameplay works the same: Be reckless, you get ♥♥♥♥ed over, Instead of souls, you have Salt and you spend those to level up and upgrade your gear.  But compared to darksouls, this game stands out on it's own very easyly; Gameplay wise, it's rather different since it's a 2D game, the atmosphere feels claustrophobic once you enter in rooms, sometime in total darkness wich forces you to use up torches to see in the dark or to equip something that will give you a few hits of what's happening around you. Another huge feature of the game is the skill tree. In this skill tree, you start somewhere different depending of wich class you choose at the begining. the left side of the tree is mostely Oriented toward spells, sightly over it, Daggers, then swords, Hammers and so forth. Each point spent in the tree gives you stats that will help you toward choosing your playstyle. For exeple; if you want to do a knight, you'll probably go to the top left where the tree have alot of STR upgrades, It's also where you'll find the skill required to weild better swords (Weapons range from level 0 to 4.) And along the way, you could also reach in the Heavy armor mastery skill along with shields, and some upgrades to your stamina and carry weight to be more efficient in close combat.  Another similar thing to the darksouls is the fact that the world is one huge map, only difference is than instead of bonfires, you have Altars, where you can praise an entity. (Little tip; depending of your awnser at the begining of the game with the first NPC, you can actuly get different entity.) And in this altar, you can donate idols wich will spawn an NPC that will aid you in your journey (Merchant, Blacksmith, traveler...)  Another thing is that if you get in an aleready claimed altar, you can level up like normal but cant donate anything unless you join them.    though some NPCs might not apreciate it...     Another thing that's different from darksouls is the curency. Yes it has salt. but it also have Gold. Gold is used to buy things from NPCs. Meaning that you don't have to worry about farming up as much souls to get the gears and items that you want. Though, if you die, you loose a good 10% (I think it's 10%, from what I experienced.) of what you acumulated so far. So yeah. This is a basic summary of what the game is like.  Pros:  +Challenging +Looks realy smooth, The animations on the characters and enemy are realy satisfying to watch +The game ambiance is very well detailed and imersive. +Alots of variety in the class you'd like to play +Controls very well with a keyboard (No clue about controler.) +Enemys and bosses are fun to fight against...  Cons: -...But some bosses are ridiculously easy if you have a good shield. Only exception are the ones that deals elemental damage. -I got lost. Alot. The game isnt holding your hand at all to show you where to go, wich is a bad but also a good thing since it encourages you to explore. -The platformings sections with certain enemys shooting you at a distance can be pretty anoying.   Final note: 8.5/10 . The game is realy great, specialy if you love the souls series. Most players that liked those will get familiar with the game very quickly, and it's friendly enough to let new players play it without worrying too much.",

            "review_text": "While abit rough around the edges, this is an exceptional game and I am glad that I gave this one a second chance.    While I wholeheardetly recommend this game, it is   NOT   for everyone.      Are you easily frustrated?   Do you feel uncomfortable, when you are thrown into a game without any knowledge of what is going on and why or if any of these things/items/options are important?  if this applies to you, I would advise you, not to bother. The game throws you into the action and expects you to read, obvserve, learn and test stuff out for yourself. It also is crushingly difficult in some parts until you figure out what to do and not always is the challenge on the fair side. Trial and error are part of this game to a certain extent.   The first few hours in particular are very unwelcoming. You stand on a shore, get asked what gods you believe in, give a random answer, ask yourself, if this was something important(it was) and embark onto your salty journey. Everything is grey, it is hard to distinguish beween monsters, traps or chairs sometimes, enemies are cluttered everywhere and you begin to ask yourself, what you are trying to accomplish with aimlessly wandering about.  Because you also don't have a map. Then you level up for the first time and take a look at the skill tree. And holy mother of god, what a cluster♥♥♥♥ of skills it is. You decide to put points into random stuff. Might be useful at some point.   In short, the first few hours are a confusing mess and a mental state between satisfying monster killing and mild annoyance because yo do not seem to know anything.   And then you get further in. You leave the first 2 areas behind. You discover a weapon you find satisfying to use. You decide to level up you skill tree in accordance with that weapon and suddenly realize, that this abundance of perks to choose from is a really simple structure of classes and suddenly makes sense.  You find a few shortcuts and slowly begin to understand, how the world is structured and how to get around it.    (you will still get lost, but you know now that whatever path you follow, it will eventually lead to someplace familiar again)    You will meet a few NPCs and fragments of a story are beginning to form. There now is this sense of slow progression, the feeling, that everything is coming together bit by bit, the further you delve into the game. You are now hooked to Salt&amp;Sanctuary.   This game is surprisingly big. I's say, you need about 15-20 hours to complete it(or even more, if you are like me and love to throughoutly explore, while getting lost like an idiot repeatedly)  It has a good amount and variety of weapons.   It has a scissor greatsword.   A second playthrough is almost a given, with all the stuff you can find and/or miss and the different builds to make.   It has a greatsword that is also a scissor.    also worth noting   This game is an hommage to Dark Souls. It has alot of names and mechanics out of the souls series, stuff you will recognize. However, it is NOT a 'souls-like' or anything along those lines. This is 100% a metroidvania game and a good one at that. If you try to play this the same way you play a souls game, you will have a hard time.     Conclusion    This game is fun, hard, full of content, really immersive and not always fair. If you are able to cope with its little flaws and oddities, you will have a gem of a game for a good price. May the Salt be in your Flavour.",

Yes this game is hard. It's also very reminiscent of Dark Souls with a pinch of Metroidvania thrown in. The brands you unlock along the way give you access to old areas that were previously unattainable and your skill tree allows for some prety deep character customization. So most of the hype was on point.   However, what many people seem to have missed in their rush to compare Salt and Sanctuary to other games, is that this is a really fun game, set in it's own fully realized game world. I've enjoyed every frustrating death and every rush of adrenaline that comes with defeating a boss or uncovering the next area to explore.  Highly recommended, more than worth the $20 I spent.  4.5 stale salty crusts out of 5.0  Oh, and it has local co-op as well! Which is a nice and salty butter cream icing on top.",

The similarities to Dark Souls come mostly from the difficulty and leveling system, which is basically identical. But the 2D platforming and exploration parts of this game are truly excellent, and I've had a blast trying to find my way through the dark caves and the towns and everything in between. The game is really reminicent of old NES games where memory played a huge key. There are lots of traps that, should you run into them, may damage you significantly or even kill you. There are a lot of enemies that may die with one hit, but if you fail to see them, or mistime a swing of your sword, those enemies can kill you and you lose all your salt to level up. I really liked the emphasis on memory in combination with 2D platforming and exploration since it's exactly what I wanted this type of game to be.
