            "review_text": "NyxQuest is a great puzzle platformer. Sure, there are better looking games out there, but I like the style and the setting. I do admit they could've used more detailed textures, but it's a Wii port, so I can't really complain. Other than that, I can't really tell you much more about it. You have the ability to fly to get to higher places and during the game you earn extra powers so that you're able to move big statues and blocks for example. There's a bug that prevents the game from saving, so you need to do a little bit of work to be able to save at all (or you have to restart from the beginning every time you play it).  Despite that I say: thumbs up. Definitely worth it.  [Rating: 74/100]",

Only once in the entire thing did I get frustrated enough to stop, and that turned out to be my own damn fault, not the game's. Wonderful.",

            "review_text": "NyxQuest is a graceful little platformer with exceptionally tight control, a unique and detailed aesthetic, and a wondrous little score that not only surprised me, it delighted me almost the entire way through.   The platforming with flying and floating controls combined with using the mouse to move various objects in the environment just feels fantastic. The level designs and puzzles are cleverly built around all the skills at your disposal, and the game's pacing is such that it builds upon previous challenges while it doles out new mechanics and powers for you to play around with very quickly.   The only real sticking point is the stage entitled 'Field of Argos' which may drive you up the wall in frustration with its somewhat unfair randomness, but perseverence and quick reflexes should see you through with enough practice.  For the quality of game you're getting here and the price point, you absolutely can't go wrong with NyxQuest.",
