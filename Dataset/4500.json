They will almost always try to stay in cover and even flank you (including mutants). The game offers a massive open world with a variety of places to explore.   The storyline is marvelous, full of intrigue and is guaranteed to get you hooked and the variety of side quests will never let you get bored. Various factions react differently to your actions so keeping all of the Zone happy is tricky, but well worth it.  The shooting part of the game is realistic. Weapons can get stuck and can shoot blanks as well. From afar you won’t be able to hit jack ♥♥♥♥, but point blank, damage output is massive (especially with shotguns, go figure). There are a few bugs, I am not gonna lie, such as some graphic issues, NPCs can get stuck inside of walls and obstacles etc.  And of course, best Cheeki Breeki experience.  Bottom line, if you’re looking for a good story and a game where you can explore I would highly recommend this as pros largely outweigh the cons.   9/10  ",

            "review_text": "Honestly, I understand not everyone may like it, its dated and at times clunky or cheesey, confusing even and sometimes frustrating, but if youre able to overlook the simple flaws it has, beneath is an incredible gem of a game.  Its based (very loosely) on the Russian novel 'Roadside Picnic' by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. (Which is a fantastic novel Id also recommend) I have yet to play the sequels but Ive heard this is the best of the games. There is also a movie titled 'stalker' that once again loosely shares a similar plot to the games and novel.  The atmosphere and chills the game produces is fantastic. It actually scared me senseless at sometimes and the enemies you fight are unique and interesting, even if you may tire of killing them over and over as there isnt too much variety, but the game remains fresh by supplying you with new weapons, locations, items, artifacts, armour and other loot that keeps you sastified throughout your playthrough.  The look of the Zone and the areas around it are incredible. You feel a sense of dread and fascination as you walk into open areas filled with destroyed facilities, communications stations, army bases, abandoned towns and villages, Stalker camps and strongeholds, safe zones and pieces of land scorched by anomalies that will turn you into paste or burn you alive.  Very fun exploration too as the Zone just looks great. Collecting artifacts and making profit feels rewarding and the battles are nerve gripping at times. Play with headphones at night for best experience (seriously though) There are basic survival needs as well, the character must eat periodically, bandages are used to stop bleeding, medkits heal greater wounds and later on radiation, infections, burns etc. Some enviromental suits protect against these things too. Different ammo types for practically every type of weapon..  I could go on and on, but you really should just try it for yourself! Definitely worth it! It usually goes on sale quite often too, so grab it during one and youll save a bunch!",

            "review_text": "This is the first game i've sat and researched in 7 years and this is why...  Usually when I play games I switch off, hit keys/buttons and just zone out the day, s.t.a.l.k.e.r shadow of chernobyl does the absolute opposite. I have learned in my limited amount of playing that complacency equals death, there is no relaxing, there is no zoning out there is only concentration.  The atmosphere of the game, sound engineering, tonality of the setting and the ambience really give off that feeling that you aren't in a playground, you are in a world where one wrong corner and one stray bullet can stop you dead.  The best way the developers could get that message across to the player is when you first step out of sids bunker, there's a random series of beeps, the wind blows and sometimes a cat wails in what is probably its last moments.   The wind blows emptily through the tree's in the distance you can hear the droning about the zone being a deathtrap and a first time player can feel extremely out of their depth, confused and lost. That feeling of dread and confusion will stick to you throughout the game, that feeling is your survival instincts, a gut feeling you never really understood until now.  The first thing many players including myself learn is that you aren't a walking death machine, you are frail and the zone let's you know that with a swift death, a death you will repeatedly see until the game crushes your precogniscent mindset on how you play shooters. You will reach a point where you will be angry and the game feels too hard and unfair but deep down, you know it was your own error that killed you so many times.  Learn the mantra: 'The zone gives with one hand and can take with the other.'  Next comes your rebirth, you become cautious of everything, every noise, every voice, bang, scream, growl and even your own footsteps. You learn the cordon like the back of your hand, you study where the dogs go and how the boars attack, you watch the military patrol, you'll probably get brave and after earning enough seeking artifacts you'll bribe the guard to let you through the railway bridge. You memorize every stash you find, you break every box, you loot everything and you drag yourself, heavy footed to the newbie village, down into sids bunker and you unload your winnings.  Then, your second lesson begins; you aren't a mule, you cannot carry every gun in the eventuality you will need it, you don't need 30 cans of meat or 50 medkits, you will never need to carry every AK47 you find. Yes I know i've played fallout and yes it kills me to leave stacks of guns on the roadside. But you need to train that out of yourself, if not, you will die and lose it all and it's that crushing choice between leaving a nice heavy suit at the bottom of a ladder or suffer a grim death at the jaws of a pack of dogs that will be your making.  Learn the mantra: 'Greed Kills'  The third lesson is one that takes time to practice and patience. The zone does not work to your advantage, you are a guest in the zone and everything there is designed to kill, you will become aware that even the air itself can kill you. One thing that terrified me was anomalies, I initially thought after studying the cordon that anomalies were a semi-visible entity that could be easily avoided, how wrong was I when I walked straight into an electro anomaly, and a burner, and vortex anomalies. The third lesson took time and plenty of error to get right, bolts are key in passing through new areas safely pay attention to the beeping you hear that's your only way of knowing they're nearby, that and always staying mindful of the other noises around you.  Learn the mantra: 'My ears precede my eyes'  The forth lesson in one that you should have been practising since day one in the zone and that's foreplanning; ensuring you have the ample equipment for the job. The landscape of each mission can vary massivley so preplan your travel. Read about the areas online, ask the stalkers about the surrounding areas, learn all you can, because even with that knowledge you can still be taken by suprise.  Learn the mantra: 'the enemy of my enemy will also kill me...unless I know they both will already'  The fifth and final lesson is discipline, knowing your environs is all well and good but understanding that the previous four lessons are not merely one time tips but a collective of constants is key. Repeating the same processes over and over becomes almost habit the act of stop, look, listen, wait becomes second nature, this is when you begin to fully understand the game you play with the zone. The game isn't to win and kill everything, it isn't even to be the best, it's about being the one who knows when to pick their moments, the right equipment, the right time of day, the right moment to move from building to building.  S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl isn't your average game, it's a lesson in life in a way, it's a mantra in itself that if you give up, you'll only feel sour about doing so, if you fail repeatedly then the way you're doing it is wrong and most of all if you relax for just one second you could get your face inverted by a bandit with a sawnoff.",

The game offers a huge choice of Eastern Block and NATO weaponry, and big number of items.   There are occasional bugs here and there, but nothing that breaks the game. I also recommend playing it with Complete Mod installed. One thing i sorely miss with Complete mod though, are some NPC speeches, such as:  - 'Get out of here Stalker. Get out of here Stalker. Get out of here Stalker' (Duty guard in Bar hangar) - 'What are you, deaf? What are you here?' (General Voronin in Bar/Duty HQ) - 'Hello-Hello' (Professor Sakharov in Yantar/Scientist Bunker) - 'I said come in, don't stand there!' (Greeter/Guard in Bar)",

            "review_text": "The Stalker series is easily some of the most fun I've had playing a video game in recent memory, surpassing even AAA titles. This is the first, Shadow of Chernobyl, and it's a very enjoyable experience.  Now that that's out of the way, I'll move on to the important stuff.  When you fire up a STALKER game for the first time, one of two things will happen; either it will load without incident, or the game will crash. It's a fact of life; the sun shines, it's currenty 8:00 AM as I write this, and STALKER games like to crash for no particular reason. Disabling the Steam overlay in-game and fiddling with the graphics options, or disabling whatever mods you may have active seems to fix most problems, but sometimes you'll get a bug that, no matter what you do, will not go away. In that case, it's time to hit the Internet and hope that someone has a fix, which, more often than not, they do.   When you do get the game to work, start it on a higher difficulty than normal. Sounds stupid, but there's a reason for that. STALKER does a lot of weird things to the guns on lower difficulties, including making a certain amount of shots (both your's and the enemy's) fade completely out of existence before hitting the target. If you're wondering why your gun isn't hitting anything even thought you've got the crosshairs on your scope lined up right on the target's head, that's why. Also, everything on the low difficulties is a bullet sponge. You are too, but only until the end, where the enemies kill you by so much as staring in your general direction. You still die fast on the higher difficulties, but now the enemies will, too. Just remember to save often to prevent crashes from erasing the last hour of progress.  If you've gathered one things from that last paragraph, it's probably that the game is pretty hard. It is, although it's also fair. You die after a few hits, but so do most enemies that aren't armored or bigger than you. In addition, every human enemy can be instantly killed by shooting them in the head with any weapon in the game (although you will need armor piercing ammo to do the same for the guys in the late-game). If you can deal with the iron sights and semi-automatic fire rate on your assault rifle, you can get through the game without much issue, although it's still a good idea to invest in better guns and optics; the iron sights on all guns tend to be a little bit hard to find. By that, I mean that the sights are off, and the bullets like to go everywhere. On the starting Makarov handgun, for example, the sights resemble a brick set between two other, differently colored bricks (although, to be fair, this is how Makarov sights look in real life). The bullets also go a little higher than you would expect. The rifles have the same problems, but they can be fixed by grabbing a scope and slapping the two together. And hey, you can take the scope off when it's time to upgrade your equipment, so you're not stuck buying another one!  Speaking of equipment, there's weapon degradation in STALKER. The good news is that, unlike the other games, you can sell your stuff no matter how broken it is. The bad news is that there's no way to fix the stuff you like. So, if you found that Desert Eagle chambered for 9x39 rounds, you might want to be careful how you use it, because that gun absolutely wrecks everything and there's only one in the entire game.   Oh yes, there's also load times. They're not that bad, but there's a lot of them. Whenever you go into a new area, it takes a few seconds to load, so get used to that.  The good news is, that's pretty much the extent of the bad. Now, let's talk about the good.  STALKER has managed to blend elements of RPG games and FPS games in a good way. It's still a FPS game, mind you, and it doesn't have experience points or any way of leveling up, but it does have a healthy amount of inventory management. During my playthrough of this game, I spent more time messing about with my guns and ammo than I did in Resident Evil 4. Be warned that bringing up your inventory does not pause the game; you can still move while rearranging things, and enemies can still attack you. If you want to pause, hit the ESC key.  The Zone is an excellent setting full of whimsy and terror. I spent just as much time frolicking over hills while drinking enough vodka to give a troubled Soviet general alcohol poisoning as I did crawling through decrepit buildings with my flashlight on, hoping a Bloodsucker wasn't waiting around the next corner, ready to tear my throat out. It really captures what it feels like living in modern-day Russia, except Russia in real life has more mutants than in STALKER.  The guns are a bit finicky, but the shooting feels fun and rewarding. The recoil is harsher than in most games, which is all the more reason why you should use semi auto.  Disregarding the crashes, the game runs pretty well. I only saw it start to sputter in a few cases, and it actually didn't crash on me that much. I believe I had an issue where it crashed whenever I tried to start a new game, and after that, it crashed two or three more times, but both of those were fixed by just firing the game up again. It wasn't as bad as New Vegas, that's for sure.   So, should you buy STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl? That depends. If you're a fan of open-world games like New Vegas, then you will enjoy this game. I highly recommend it.  ",

Also it has a pretty decent story, though one you can easily ignore due to the massive amounts of side-quests there are.  In short... it's kinda like a Russian Fallout, though set in Ukraine.

            "review_text": "I enjoy Deus Ex and System Shock 2 as much as the next person, but for me S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernoybl towers over the first-person shooter genre.  It's that chilling feeling gotten by wondering across the bleak open landscape while hearing dogs howling in the distance (this being one of the very few games to be able to pull off outdoor daylight horror), It's that weird moment when you see some invisible monster for the first time and realise the game's surreal underbelly. It's the beautiful atmosphere created by the lightning. It's the tension built by running around trying to find that one last bit of radiation protection before you die of radiation poisoning. It's that feeling of satisfaction when you finally manage to fight your way through a group of clever AI enemies, or the stress built by panickingly trying to drink enough energy drink to simply run through them.   Or, more broadly - it's the perfect mixture of challenging difficulty, fantastic atmosphere and great survival mechanics which make it so special.  The game builds itself on creating tension through its inventory management system and creates such perfect results through it. Funnily enough, early in the game I found it annoying that managing your inventory doesn't pause the game and sometimes I stopped dead in the middle of combat because I was too heavy to move, but by the end I realised that was such an incredible way of building tension. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is, after all, a game of scavenging and half the fun of the game is about deciding whether you can afford to go over to pillage a befallen enemy, work out what you need to take and if it's not too heavy to carry without getting killed.  But great survival mechanics and a really well balanced difficulty don't make a game on its own and the other main thing which really makes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. stand out is its gameworld. It's such a beautiful, desolate overworld and as much enjoyment as the challenge was just running over the baron plains with dogs howling and boars roaming around with some odd shots in the background. Even, the main homehub of Rostock has this incredibly eerie and desolate feel about it.  There's just this exquisite balance of challenge and ambience which make this the perfect FPS. Played alone, at night with headphones it is quite the experience.",

The world has been crafted really nicely, the atmosphere gives you the feeling that even though people are struggling to survive their's still hope IF your willing to put your life on the line. Only thing I disliked was the sheer amount of enemies that would be in nearly every single firefight, I mean seriously! You expect me to liberate an entire base by taking out nearly thirty something enemies? Now that might be an easy thing to do in CoD or games similar to that, but this is way more hardcore and death can come as easily as you sprinting around a corner only to be one shotted by a dude toting around a shot gun. ^__^",

But it isn't, your in a Cordon zone of the Chernobyl area that has been abandon since April of 1986 due to NPP4 catastrophic failure rendering the environment hazardous to live in. Yes, the place dose exists for real, all locations are based on real locations in the real zone. Life is still going on everyday for the people out side of the zone. The Stalker game series is inspired off the book 'Roadside Picnic', which is a short science fiction novel written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky in 1971. More information on this book is available on a wiki, and the book is also available in English now. The game is a open world exploration as well as mission directive, Remember that.  Shadow Of Chernobyl is the first release of the stalker game series, not only is it less buggy, but the most mod friendly. I been in this zone since the first release of the dvd 1.0 in 2007. Back when modders were just starting out the great mega big mods that change the game story such as AMK, Inferno, Oblivion Lost, and Priboy came along pioneering the way to the mods of today. Matter in fact, some of the modders works can be found even in Clear Sky's dbase files like AMK is listed, some of the team even has scripts in it.   Here your in the Cordon off Zone in which has become a prison. You can get in, but you can't get out. There is trading with traders, and different factions that may or may not care for you. Many dangerous anomalies to contend with, and artifact to collect and sell for money. Have to watch out for the areas that are radioactive still. One of the things to remember is question everyone and trust no one. Being skeptical with a gut feeling at times is better than a fire fight, When in this game it is important. It also in this game you have 3 alternate ending, pending on how or what you do will decide the end of your fate..   It works on win7 64 bit, you may want to check in the forums. There has been complaints pending Operating systems causing issues with the game. The stalker community out of many I have seen is the most helpful there. It seems every stalker dose what they can to help you. And a good community like that is a nice thing to have.  ",

Some people might disagree with me, but considering that the game came out by a small unknown Ukrainian company and that barely any computers could run it in high settings is pretty mindblowing. After having done a playthrough of both Vanilla and a modded version, I would prefer the modded version since the Vanilla has extremely horrible weapon accuracy, and the mods can add so much new to it. There's even multiple endings in the game, depending on how you play the game. This game is also really immersive. And by really, I mean extremely. This game is considered a 'Horror game' by many people, I can say that it's both true and false. It's terrifying because as you walk through the forests, ruins of Pripyat and the lone roads of Chernobyl, you WILL feel more alone and deserted. There is other Stalkers, just like you around the Zone, whether they're Bandits (Which are hostile and will attempt to ♥♥♥♥ up everyone in their way for money.) or Loners (They're non-hostile, but your greed will decide their fate). You can also decide your own pace in the game, which I find really cool too. You can basically do a run through without getting any gear and money and make it to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant within one hour, only your general experience will put a stop to your actions. But yeah, you can do so much in the game, whether you feel like hunting mutants for the hell of it, or hunting people for their stuff which you can sell.  If you haven't bought it by now, do it. This game is extremely good RPG elements too. If you're just looking through the review for cool mods, I would recommend Stalker Complete Mod if you want the game to be free of bugs and have some HQ textures added.  If you're looking for some new content, like the cut mutants being added like Zombies (Not to be mistaken by Zombified Stalkers), Izloms/Fractures (Which like the Zombies are also mutated humans, just creepier) and Burers. It also modifies the game, AI placement-wise go look up Super Mod Pack on ModDB. Oh, it also adds hundreds of new guns along with unique and really good ones and adds HQ textures for the existing ones. Super Mod Pack is the best mod I have tried for the game, so you might go with that.   Welcome to the Zone, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.",

            "review_text": "The start of the bleak ex-bloc survival shooter. STALKER SoC is an example of a systems-heavy open world FPS, that does an amazing job of demonstrating the broader potential within the genre. The mix of exploration, survival, hostile environment, and warring factions, makes for a much more compelling setting than any standard military or tactical shooter. The story of SoC is particularly strong, despite leaning on an amnesiac opening, and with multiple endings, you'll at least want to keep a few save files on hand. Travel and exploration are both dangerous and rewarding. Managing your inventory is a challenge, requiring mastery in itself. If you go into Stalker expecting to be an RPG-style pack mule, you'll be disappointed. For all that it does so well, and the ways in which it innovates, I don't feel that the game as released is truly 'complete'. While I'd recommend playing it in vanilla, for your first run through (and you'll probably want a second), I can't recommend 'Oblivion Lost' too highly, when it comes to revisiting the game. Previously empty areas of the map are filled, new creatures introduced, and others taken to a superior state. If you ever wondered how the 'Psuedodog' got its name, you'll figure that out pretty quick, in a playthrough of Oblivion Lost. If you're a fan of the FPS genre, this is a must for you to experience. The Zone is not for the feint of heart, but it is a pivotal stop for FPS fans.",

STALKER is has some bugs, silly voice acting (some characters only have one line and will repeat it every time you come into view: google 'Get out of here stalker', or 'I said come in, don't stand there'), but overall it's a great game.  Similiarities and differences: STALKER is most similar to Metro: 2033, probably because they are some of the same people who made it. It is not very similar to Fallout 3, other than the large world (Fallout 3 is much larger) but there is no level system, no experience points. Just reputation with factions, which basically means 'Did you kill any Duty members? Did you kill any Freedom members?' since these are the only real factions in the game which don't initially hate you.  Mechanics: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is an exploration based game, if I had to call it something. The world is filled with anomalies that hurt you as you stand near. Throwing a bolt in the direction of one will activate it, showing you where it is. Expensive 'artifacts' will fall out of them sometimes, and they will have various effects on your character. For instance, there is one that increases health regeneration but decreases bullet defense, and all other defense. It is terrible. There is also my favorite, Moonlight, which increases Endurance and decreases electrical defense. Endurance is the system of sprinting, carrying things, etc. If you are over-encumbered, and you walk places, your endurance will slowly go down. If you sprint, it will instantly go down. Having an endurance boosting artifact is one of the best things in the game because it gives endless sprinting when below 50 KG and longer sprinting above that. You cannot carry very much and must be very careful with inventory management.  Side-missions will reward artifacts and special weaponry. They have a time limit. One set of side missions unlocks the 'true' ending, you should save multiple times in the end of the game to ensure you get that, and look up how to unlock these side missions before going into Chernobyl.  The storyline has you going from different areas into the game, until you get to the top of Army Warehouses, which is the end-game area.  The shooting mechanics are very nice. Everyone, including you, has low health. Guns are inaccurate, damaging, and have bullet drop. Headshots are very powerful and can lead to a quick death, which makes this game hard for you too. There are many different guns and armors, many different bullet types. Rifles, Grenade Revolvers, Handguns, SMGs, shotguns, gauss gun, rocket launcher, sniper rifles. You can equip one major weapon and one pistol at the same time. To switch them out, you need to go into inventory.   I love this game and it has a great open-world exploration aspect of it. Anomalies, bandits, mutants, and monolith are your enemies and the zone watches your fights.",

The exclusion zone is beautifully created and the bleak atmosphere is captured well. There are plenty of weapons, not weapons different because of stats but different unique weapons that can be modified with a scope or a grenade launcher. Artifacts can be collected and used for additional stats like protection against radation or bullets.  'You kill two blood suckers and your health is down and the screen stars to swim and that moment of dread when you realise that a controller is nearby!' that's horror!

The lore and information introduced in the game's encyclepedia is not only interesting but vitally useful as well. This is the ONLY game I've ever played where reading the ingame lore compendium or encyclepedia entries as they unlock is rewarding! Enemies are challenging and frighteing, especially when you encounter new mutants that you don't know much about. You have to be aware of your environment when fighting so you don't back-pedal into a lethal anomaly or radiation patch.  Only 10 is hours in but I am loving the adventure of this game.

Only lack i find here is the lack of multiplayer, since i think this would go great in multiplayer, however it is bearable since it's a 2007 game, when gaming wasn't so full of multiplayer. I was always attracted to these types of games, so i might exaggarate. I just have 11 hours so far but i'm ready to go deeper into it, now i need to go to the lab X18 which is known to be the most scary, it's night time so i'm at the bar preparing for the day, another thing is a lack of skipping a night, this is my 2nd night, and i need to wait, it's around 0.5h. You see all these games about surviving in a post apocalyptic world, like DayZ, well, stalker started it, and it started well.

STALKER definitely offers a unique 'gritty' experience that many other games won't ever aim for.

Dodging bullets, I sprinted back to the first HQ which started a firefight between the military and stalkers. I hid in an abondanded house, while a quest giving npc caught a bullet with his face and died. I failed the 'quests' he gave me but I got to scavenge his body and took his guns and money.

'S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl' has an amazing atmosphere and a challenging difficulty unlike most other shooters. Instead of running and gunning, you need to approach objectives carefully and plan your route through areas, which make gunfights feel more real. You also need to eat, treat your wounds, take anti-radiation drugs and manage your inventory.  The A.I. is pretty good, and will live its own life whether you participate in the game or not. You will run across non-scripted events like faction clashes, mutant vs stalker fights and even mutants vs mutants brawls.  A lot of guns are customizable, there are various armors and outfits with different stats for use in different situations and there are artifacts scattered around the world which will improve (or worsen) those stats.  This is one of few games where I can just stay in one place for what feels like hours, admiring, listening to and soaking in the rich atmosphere. But in the other end of the spectrum, there are places that I don't even want to visit because of the horrors that awaits there.  I highly recommend playing this game on Master difficulty, even if it is your first time playing, to get that real S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience. Successfully finishing a raid or quest when you know that death is always just seconds away just makes everything so much more rewarding. Instadeath is everywhere, so remember to save often!  The community has created lots of mods, ranging from graphical improvements, bugfixes and in-game tweaks to complete reworks of the game mechanics and content, which all adds to this game's replay value. This community is still very much alive, even though the game is seven years old at the time of writing, and new mods come out every now and then ('S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Lost Alpha' being one of the latest).  My personal mod recommendations for enhancing the game but retaining the 'vanilla' experience are:  - Zone Reclamation Project (ZRP) - bugfixes and game tweaks - S:T.A.L.K.E.R. Weather Overhaul (SWO) - A new and better weather system - Absolute Nature and Absolute Structures - Texture packs - Less Bad Nightvision - Slightly improves the night vision - Shaders MAX - Lighting engine improvements - Brussell's ENB - Adds bloom, motion blur and depth of field (DoF) and further improves the lighting  Today's wave of survival games need to learn from THIS game when it comes to atmosphere, loot, gunplay and build upon its environmental ideas.

I'm sure many agree with me - it was my first venture into computer gaming many years ago (2008 is when I picked it up originally, I believe). Set in and around the area of Chernobyl (obviously), the world is open for you to explore and discover your identity, as you are an amnesiac. The games' structure is pretty evenly paced for the most part, however there is a very, very steep learning curve at the beginning if you are used to run-and-gun style games (particularly the first mission, where you are outnumbered and unequipped to handle the situation if you don't use tactics). You'll encounter everything from run-of-the-mill thugs and highly trained soldiers, all the way down to mutated beasts and telekenetic monsters throughout your journey. Overall, the game is a bit buggy to this day, and most people enjoying this title won't be computer-savvy enough to iron out some of the fixes possible.

For the more intuitive PC gamer, the XRay Engine is highly moddable and the mod scene for STALKER is large and incredibly high quality. A vanilla playthrough is always recommended for first-timers, but subsequent playthroughs are much better with mods, as you appreciate what the mods change after experiencing the genuinely oh-so-lovely horrors of vanilla.  Gunplay is fun, voice actors laughably bad, and the story is surprisingly good with bits of lore from books, science fiction, and even inspirations from the real life Exclusion Zone. One of my most favorite games of all time with incredible replayability and modding potentional, and an early example of an indie game before indie games were the fad of the day. STALKER is not for everyone, and takes a special kind of mindset to love, but for those that connect with it, nothing else compares. It is a game of legend.

It's a semi-open world game where you can explore areas to find stashes and run into other stalkers and their respective factions. The stalkers are those that roam the zone, the area within and surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. As you can imagine, the zone is infested with pockets of radiation that can cause severe harm, strange monsters roam about, people fight for survival, ecologists are simply trying to study, and you're at the center of it all.  In the game, you play as the 'Marked One', a stalker that was left for dead on a 'death truck'. Luckily for you, a fellow loner/stalker finds you and takes you to Cordon, where the gameplay begins. Because you're rescued by a fellow stalker who is employed by the local trader, you're tasked with a few missions and he also helps you set up your PDA where your sole mission that was already there is to 'Kill Strelok'. Who is Strelok? Well, play the game and find him, dammit.  The story is really intricate, but let's shift away from that as it really boils down from going to area to area and accepting missions, sidequests, fighting in an arena for money, trading and selling goods, collecting weapons, ammo, etc. The story is really good by the way, but I just wanna talk about the gameplay. It's an FPS, duh. It's not like other FPS games, though, as it's more open in your choices, there are dialog options, albeit limited, and you can swap armor. It's not exactly an RPG, however, as there is no leveling system employed. And it's not a full on horror game as it's not terribly scary, there's just some really bizarre creatures that you run into. Most of the time, however, you'll be shooting other humans.  The atmosphere is grimy, grey, and at some points, yellow, but not in a filtered Fallout 3 kind of way. It's natural lighting. Well, technically artificial, but you get the point. Buildings are destroyed, people speak about staying alive, playing guitars around a fire pit, smoking, laughing, drinking. The atmosphere is really cool with both the characters and how they interact and the world, itself.  Pripryat shines in this game, the devs clearly took the time to research the city, the blueprints of the city, and I believe they visited the city as well, considering the devs are Ukrainians. As the devs are Ukrainians, that means the spoken language is accurate, the facial designs are accurate, etc. These guys knew what they were doing and they also did the scientific research as far as radiation pockets and possible effects of an expanding radiated zone.

People are paying money for STALKERs to recover strange artifacts from the hazardous anomalous areas of the Zone, so the eggheads can maybe find something to benefit humanity as a whole.  Try to regain your memory, explore the Zone in a sandbox-style environment that lets you go where you want, without being shoehorned into linear corridor-style level progression, discover who you are, where Strelok is, and how he fits into all of this.  ♥♥♥♥ call of duty, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is where it's at.",

It felt like a serious Fallout to me and gave me the creeps a few times.

            "review_text": "(Just a note: I played this game on the highest difficulty and WITHOUT MODS and don’t come crying to me saying that you need to use mods for a better experience or something along those lines)   Stalker shadow of Chernobyl is a free roaming fps game.   Stalker takes place in what’s known as the zone after the nuclear incident in Chernobyl which has ruined a lot of the landscape, turned most animals into monsters, and poisoned a lot of areas with radiation and has created what are called anomalies which are murderous whether effects in one small spot, you play as a stalker (which stands for scavenger, trespasser, adventurer, loner, killer, explorer and robber) known as the marked one, you have amnesia and you are left with a PDA saying to kill some guy named Strelok, the story is almost non-existent but that doesn’t matter because a lot of games I play the story takes a huge backseat and doesn’t really matter that much.   Stalker’s gameplay revolves around exploration, combat and completing quests and side quests which will give you rewards given to you by various people you’ll come across which will be marked on your PDA. In stalker you have an inventory system very similar to resident evil 4 where it’s a grid and each item will appear as a diagram and will take up space on the grid only you can stack all items, there’s weight limit with the inventory system: once you’re above the weight limit your stamina will drop extremely quickly if it will let you sprint. You have various suits and artefacts that you can find which all have different effects on the player such as resistance to radiation, reduction to how much you’ll bleed out when you are shot, an increase in stamina etc. You have a hunger and thirst system which you’ll need to use drinks and food when an icon appears on the right side of the screen, you’ll have to drink vodka or use certain medical equipment for when you have radiation poising and you’ll have to use bandages and med kits to stop you from bleeding out which both of these are notified by an icon that will appear on the right side of the screen. You can also trade items with various NPCs. There are also various enemy factions which you’ll come across in this game.   It’s extremely difficult to say what’s to like about this game but one thing I can say is that this game is strangely compelling but it comes with a few glaring issues and problems.  Stalker has some of the worst gunplay I’ve ever seen in any shooting game, most of the time you can’t hit what you’re aiming at, regardless of the distance between you and what you’re shooting at, regardless of whether you’re stood still or moving, regardless of your posture, regardless of whether you’re spraying or using burst fire or single shots and for the most part regardless of what weapon you’re using. However if you turn on the crosshair, unless the gun has a scope, hip firing is significantly more accurate than using iron sights,well when you put it on paper you are more accurate firing at a wall using iron sights from a distance but this magically disappears when shooting at an enemy, and hip firing is generally more effective against enemies and it also doesn’t help that the iron sights are horrible in this game and seriously get in the way. Even if you are going for the “realistic” way: DON’T, because iron sights are useless in this game (they’re better in the two sequels though)   The combat is just far too inconsistent in this game. In most games the enemies can hit you most if not every single time and the damage output is consistent and varies game to game, in Stalker the enemies have a completely random chance of hitting you, they also have a random damage output, so sometimes you’ll get just a scratch but others you’ll die instantly. A perfect examples of this is where I had to defend an area from a bandit raid, I was about 50 feet away from the enemies, they seemed to be unable to hit me until one of them suddenly and randomly did and I died instantly. You can go from an enemy noticing you and killing you instantly in one shot, then reload a save but this time that enemy might not be able to hit anything even when you are banzai charging towards them with the knife, which I have done before. Your success all comes down to retrying until you succeed because you got lucky, it doesn’t ever feel like skills matter in this game, and it’s, not like reaction time matters or anything in this it’s just ridiculous. There is the argument of “it’s trying to be realistic” no game is properly realistic, none, not even something such as Arma 3. I guess quite a fair bit in reality with wars can be down to luck but nothing like in this game.   when you reload a save, the enemies go back to their starting positions and sometimes their starting positions are behind you and you’ll get killed right away when you’ve loaded a save.  The movement in this game is almost headache inducing it does this really sickening head bobbing when you move, it sways to the bottom left and right really quickly.   I’ve had an extremely difficult time deciding whether to recommend this game or not, I guess it all comes down to whether you think you can put up with these problems and I’m only recommending this game because I don’t hate it enough to not recommend it. Though after several playthroughs I like it significantly more than the first time I played this game.   I have played this game with some mods but to be honest, you should just play the vanilla game because the mods don't really make much difference or properly improve the game, they all pretty much update the graphics, improve one or two features, overlook some of the issues and then add new ones on top, a lot of people say “oh it fixes all of the bugs”, well I can tell you I’ve played quite a bit of the vanilla game and I’ve NEVER come across a bug. There’s also a trend that’s been going around for a while with games such as the Stalker games, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and onward, where people think playing it with mods is better and they become complete elitist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and have a massive go at people for playing the vanilla game and look down on them as if they are sub human. You can’t just ignore all of the problems with the vanilla game and say “oh but with this mod it’s great”, that’s like taking some really crappy games such as Ride to hell Retribution and that claiming playing it with mods is good, and the vanilla game matters the most. ♥♥♥♥ this trend, and all of the elitist people who support it.",

Let me start by saying it's as buggy as maggots in cow ♥♥♥♥. If you can't deal with that, I can't recommend the game. You're going to have at least one crash. In my experience, I actually had to heal manually-- using items on bodies crashed the game.   I'd look past the bugs though.   Stalker SoC is the perfect mix of story, combat, world-building, and atmosphere. It tells the best over-arching story of all three games, and has a mixture of good combat and good atmosphere.   Stalker Clear Sky has my favorite combat and gameplay of the series, but it seriously lacks purpose and meaning. It DOES have atmosphere, but not in the lonely, horrifying way SoC and CoP focus on.  Stalker Call of Pripyat has the best atmosphere, focusing more on side-missions and powerful events, but it doesn't feel like anything massive is going on. You're a guy in the Zone who has a hard life and sees bad things. The atmosphere here is perfect BECAUSE you aren't important, but the sense of scale is toned back.   Stalker SoC doesn't do combat or agency as well as Clear Sky, and it doesn't do gripping side-missions and stories like CoP, but it DOES build the world for them to exist in. Without SoC's worldbuilding, Clear Sky and CoP wouldn't have as much oomph as they do. You wouldn't feel as connected to the Zone. You wouldn't be a stalker. Which is why you're here anyways, right?   Buy SoC and play it first. Get connected, have some feels, get cheeki breeki. Play Clear Sky and operate with other stalkers. Feel cool. Rage at the bugs. Then buy CoP and play it last. Let it translate all the feelings you've developed into one concise experience. It'll make a lasting impression on you.   Then get ready for the memes. If you've gotten through the first, you've essentially branded 'im a dank slav' on your chest. Have fun. You're in the cool kids club now.",

Gameplay is good, combat is phenomenal and so immersive, AI is good but can't take cover, throw grenades and so on. Story is great, multiple endings. Music is fantastic, sounds are beautiful, but limited. Not much voice acting, except for combat, where it's hilarious cause they speak russian and I don't.  Great storyline, and immersiveness. Has proper multiple endings, including 3 endings which you can fail in and obviously this ends the game earlier. Super immersiveness, great environment, ambient sounds and okay stealth system. My only major problem is no fast travel, so if you wanna go back to earlier areas you have to walk there, which takes like an hour if you have reached the Duty base.  Another problem is that you can't fix items, so if your weapons starts jamming or your suit is damaged, you can't repair 'em and you have to buy new ones, and that's super expensive.  Lovely game.

            "review_text": "I'd like to call this game the child of Fallout 3 and Metro: 2033, but that implies that it's more epic than it is.   I never played the vanilla version. The word was the graphics were horrible and the bugs were rampant. I went straight for the user-end patch that offered a complete graphical upgrade, bugfixes, that sort of thing.   Stalkers are basically looters inside a series of zones polluted by Chernobyl's alternate timeline fallout. Your character was discovered amongst a pile of bodies outside a military truck, and you are nursed back to health. The only thing you know about yourself is that you have a PDA with a single message: kill Strelok.   SoC isn't actually that big of a game. Each zone has your assortment of bandits, mutants, and factions that you can ally with or open fire upon. Some encounters are random, dynamic, but some are pre-scripted. The group of loners (your starting faction) that are defending themselves against bandits in the west end of a zone called Garbage will always be doing so no matter how many times you visit, and should any friendlies fall, they'll have randomized replacements next time.   I'll be up front with you - the story is gibberish. I'm not even sure how much of the actual information was missing, but all of it was presented very, very badly. Nonsensical flashbacks appear sometimes, but it's clear they had a sequel in mind to explain everything. That may be the case, but having seen that mechanic plenty of times before, they still half-♥♥♥♥♥ its implementation.   The combat is challenging. There are multiple types of ammunition, some armor piercing and others not. Ironsights, even patched are essentially useless. Bullets go wherever the ♥♥♥♥ they want, and you will waste entire clips trying to get ONE headshot that is EXACTLY within your sights. Scoped headshots on the other hand are right on the money, but it'll be a little while before you can get either a scope or a weapon that already has one. Part of the unofficial patch is supposed to improve the enemy AI. Since I haven't heard anything about it failing to do so, I don't even want to think of how bad it must have been because it's STILL broken. Enemies are obnoxiously perfect shots (you take extra damage from headshots) and yet somehow you can crouch and flank them and they will be completely oblivious - sometimes even ignoring you after you start shooting. Should you sneak around and flank, frequently they'll pour whole clips into concrete walls in the direction of where you USED to be. In any case, get used to reloading previous saves - it will happen many, many times. Especially on the last mission where the enemies are downright CHEAP.   I'm not sure if sleep actually matters, but it's a way to pass the night. Food matters, but there's so much of it that it isn't an intrusive mechanic. Weapons deteriorate in condition but it happens so slowly that it doesn't matter. Storage is a bit of an issue - always store your stuff in blue boxes (never store stuff in 'stashes'). The inventory system in the game has strict encumberance, so if you're a loot ♥♥♥♥♥ it will drive you bonkers. Take my advice and only sell artifacts after you've gotten some starter cash.   The weapon system is broad, with some degree of customization, but the truth is it's kind of wasted on the game. It's just too short. That's not to say there aren't things to do, but if you do minimal sidequesting, the whole game takes you about 20 hours, and it's hard to say how much of that time included reloads. Being that there are two sequels, I see no reason to explore. Most of the side missions have terrible rewards.   The game has great atmosphere. It's nothing like Metro's polish, but it does the job, especially in the underground areas. Mutants are creepy as **** and you'll always have some anticipation about what new kind you'll discover. I feel inclined to point out that only one reload was from a mutant death. The other several dozen reloads were from human enemies, so make of that what you will.",

First, it makes me believe I'm in an open world until I see the first 'move to the next level?' which makes me painfully realize that I'm not really, then it's the way the game tries to be realistic in terms of combat, but I can shoot a guy in the head three times and he's still alive and kicking. And finally, it's that feeling that everything is without purpose. I go fetch some ducuments in some old camp or factory. There are soldiers, bandits, mutants, anomalies. I spend hours getting rid of them because my weapons hardly do any damage. I played this game for almost 20 hours until I realized that I just get frustrated because there's hardly any sense of achievement or progression. I run around and suddenly, when I reach a certain point, I advance to some next level where the story continues. It's a shame because there is so much potential in this game but it just feels unfinished. All I do is go to some place, avoid obstacles, shoot ennemies and go back to cash in some reward. It's not the worst game but after some time, it just gets boring as hell.",

I think a game should be able to stand by itself and that mods should only add to an already great experience.   I really wanted to like this game, and I am no fanboy. I only recently decided to give / series a try. It has a lot of potential and a lot of good things going for it. Never have I had a game produce such conflicting emotions in regards of love and hate.   But in the end, the numerous; and I do mean numerous flaws, ruined my experience. I could write a list that would fill a page or two on just all the bad design choices and all the bugs that need to be fixed. that its a bit riduculous.   Such things like Stealth in this game is so sensitive that its nigh impossible to use. Enemies see you instantly, and once one sees you the whole base sees you. Compounded with the bug that allows enemies to sometimes see and shoot you through walls makes it double worthless.   Sometimes I would load into a new area and find that I spawned in the middle of 5 to 6 enemies with shotguns. Guess what you die. And you will die alot in this game. Almost as bad as dark souls, but most of the deaths in this game feel undeserving. You fail not because its genuinly hard, but because you rolled the dice wrong. You can be shooting and using cover effectively and taking out 5, 6, 7 guys with no problem and then you barely pop your head around a corner and boom headshot your dead. or that guy you didn't notice with a shotgun flank you from behind. Guess what shotgun instantly kill you at close range at the eariler parts of the game.   I could still list many many more problems. Such as the knife is useless and when you shoot opponets and make them stagger (a temporary stun) Instead of gonig 'oh good I can reload or can quickly kill the staggered enemy', Well you can't, because for reasons unknown enemies are invulnable to damage while staggered and shooting them then only wastes bullets.",

Unusual key bindings can likely be fixed, but that won't ever compensate for the fact that there is too many unlikable details that this game posseses. The weapons and ammunition in this game are literally useless. I became trapped in a two or three story building within less than two hours of playing and no matter how many manuveurs I pull and no matter how much ammunition I have, I am f***ed. I don't know if this is just unfortunate circumstance, but when hurt in battle, I will hide behind cover and nobody will show up for a multitude of seconds; they wait for you to open up your inventory to spawn back out and kill you. Yes, gameplay doesn't stop at checking your inventory, and you will die if you aren't unrealistically quick enough.  The characters I've met so far are also boring. They all talk when you walk up to them, but after that you have to read their paragraphs; they don't read them for you. Textures and animations of characters are also primitive considering that this was released in 2007. All you do is run around doing favors for money and information. No interesting, out of the ordinary dialogue, and the storyline so far is dull and all I know of it is the short introduction sequence in the beginning which really doesn't explain very much to keep me interested. The fact that this game lacks auto save doesn't help its cause either.  I'm not the best at gaming, and I mostly play for the storyline. It's not fair to compare games to different games of different series from different companies, but I must admit that games like Half-Life are much more playable and have a more interesting storyline than STALKER, and that's almost a decade older than STALKER.  If you are more into easy but exciting combat accompanied by an appealing story, you've come to the wrong game. I got this game on sale, which is good because this in my humble opinion is definitely not worth its usual $20. I'm sure if I continued to play I would be more interested into the storyline, but the gameplay and combat just kills it for me. I bought the first STALKER only so that I can try it out before I buy the others. I'm glad I did because I have no interest into playing this game ever again.",

Pros: 1) A pretty epic story 2) Fun battle encounters 3) Entertaining throughout the game.  Cons: 1) The constant rocking when walking takes serious getting used to &amp; will most likely make you dizzy at first. 2) Broken English and inaccurate subtitles are sometimes a minor hinderance. 3) There's a serious issue with glitches. Mission glitches, Secret Stash glitches, enemy spawning glitches, &amp; every now and them you'll get environmental glitches like getting permanantly stuck behind or inside and objector even falling through the ground entiriely. 4) The moster AI leaves something to be desired (they are stupid). 5) The saving, although relatively simple (Press ESC, click save, select save spot, confirm, then click return), it does ruin the fluidity of game-play when you have to save every 5-10min or risk losing all your progress. A simple quicksave key would have fixed this issue. 6) Compared to other S.T.A.L.K.E.R games, there's a serious lack of weapons &amp; modifications. In fact, the only mods you can do is add &amp; remove scopes on a select few weapons &amp; an undermount grenade launcher on even fewer weapons. There's also a supressor you can change onto any handgun. 7) Death, you die, a lot! Specifically as you get closer to the end of the game, which frankly, just becomes irritating.  Altogether this game is a conundrum to me, I did like playing the game, but I don't think I would reccomend this game anyways, simply because all of the 'Con' factors &amp; the fact that you have two better choices in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series.",

            "review_text": "Don't let my Steam gametime stats fool you - I've been around the Zone for quite some time... The first STALKER game I played was - funnily enough - the last one released in the series: Call of Pripyat. But eventually, I got around to GSC's debut entry in the franchise. And boy, was I glad that I did. About five years, three playthroughs and one   big   PC upgrade later, I've come to understand and appreciate ShoC for what it was meant to be, buried beneath all those bugs: one truly tense and atmospheric game. ShoC is a distinctive game (indeed, STALKER is a distinctive franchise): if you like fairly open-world gameplay that combines FPS, RPG and OMG HOLY ♥♥♥♥ elements, this is one cheeki breeki game for you.  Thanks to the fine people who worked on the Zone Reclamation Project patch, ShoC was basically transformed from a glitchy, bug-fest (at least upon release) into a cult classic. ZRP, unlike other mods such as the oft-lauded Complete, gives you something really special: a leaner, meaner Zone to chew on, compared to Complete. It's basically vanilla ShoC 2.0 - an ESSENTIAL mod if ever there was one. Complete is pretty good for what it is: a 'complete' overhaul that, despite its claims, really DOES change the gameplay. Quite simply, it's much easier than ZRP/vanilla ShoC (even on Master difficulty) and those epic gunfights where you trade bullets with bandits is compressed. For a game where combat is so important, Complete totally streamlines it. Yet it's still one worth checking out on subsequent playthroughs, as it does introduce a whole host of pretty neat features and spiffy new textures (among bug fixes and the like) but ultimately, you'll end up playing ShoC Lite. It's a really pretty and fairly deep ShoC Lite, though, which is totally fine for those who want that kind of experience. I started with Complete all those years and playthroughs ago on my gimped laptop and while I totally dug STALKER the game, I really am glad that I got to play through what I consider the authentic STALKER experience with ZRP - the changes Complete makes are glaringly obvious if you play Complete then ZRP/vanilla. Complete's good - hell, pretty great in some respects - but it's not really STALKER. Though I am looking forward to trying out mods like Oblivion Lost and AMK for ShoC. There are tons of mods out there for ALL the STALKER games.  For your maiden voyage into the Zone, though, the ZRP and Shaders MAX mods (which improve FPS rates and can even introduce major graphical improvements while retaining a vanilla feel) are trustier allies than all the perfect condition AK-47's in the world combined. Now get out of here, STALKER!",

And yes bugs are notorious although not as problematic as when the game was first released. The latest patch on Steam should suffice, but I also recommend looking into the Zone Reclamation Project mod for a vanilla experience with minor enhancements.   All in all, great game.

That invisible wall, masked by debris, felt like a cop-out to me. I thought I was actually trying to fight my way into the city, like it was supposed to be challenging. But nah.  Anyway, 'fighting your way into and/or past things' is what the main mode of progression in Stalker is, minus the RPG bits (like VATS, or the still-slow-paced real-time combat) that made F3 sometimes feel less fun than it should have been.

I'll be looking more into the problem and hopefuly get to play it more and write a more positive review soon. Though as of now 15 minute waits are not worth buying this game.",

Progress through the game is accomplished by completing the main objectives, as well as a number of optional sidequests assigned by an angry fat man, offering various rewards, though this usually isn't as lucrative as simple murdering groups of bandits and taking and selling their things.   The game is very grim, and even without the spooky story, I had a lot of fun just roaming around and trying to keep my Stalker fed, armed, and relatively radiation free.

I don't mean the game is half-baked like concept art can sometimes be; I mean that in terms of visuals and audio the art style has been pretty much flawlessly executed by the developers    Rich, open world. There's no shortage of places you can loot, find enemies to fight, or get lost and scared in    Varied gameplay elements. It's neither an FPS, or an RPG, or a horror game but it blends elements from all those genres, and it does it well. This isn't a new concept in 2015 but it was fresh at the time    Neutral     Minimal hand holding. There's a fairly linear main quest running through the game but the real enjoyment comes from the side quests and general exploring you can do outside of the main story line. Nothing is fully explained or served up to you on a plate, which in some ways fits perfectly with the bleak and hostile atmosphere of the game itself. This could be a big plus or negative point depending on your point of view    Negative     Has been known to be buggy. I personally have never experienced anything game-breakingly bad, but there's some inherent 'clunk' to it and you're almost guaranteed to notice some strange AI behaviour at times    Can be frustratingly or unfairly difficult. Not necessarily a bad thing if you're a European Extreme kind of guy, but depending on your chosen difficulty setting (it's a lot more fun on harder ones) make sure you save your game regularly   S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is possibly not the best title in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, but I'd wholly recommend it to fans of similar games and it's definitely one of my all-time favourite PC games.

Don't play the game on Novice, because a good percentage of your bullets won't render, meaning you'll click, but the gun won't shoot. It is a game best played on Master edition or not at all, which is fine by me, because all of my bullets do as much damage to my enemies as my enemies do damage to me. This is not a game to play if you fear failure. This is not a game to play if you think you're good at videogames. This is not a game to play if you freighten easy, because this game, though old, will find new ways to terrorize you. Enemy monster-types are not scary because they look the part, they're scary because of what they can do, and they're VERY good at it. Everything matters, not getting to a point in time can cause a man in charge of advancing your quests to die. Not helping out your fellow STALKER may mean that bandits will be there instead of friendly faces. This is a game of choices, and not all of the ones you make are going to be good ones. It's up to you to make the best out of a bad situation, and if that means taking a break by the campfire to chug vodka in an attempt to cure radiation poisioning, in a small encampment, with a few fellows gathered around to talk in a language you likely don't know, well.

The game really has a survival feel. You have to eat every so often, there is limited amount that you can carry and you are not a rambo like in many other games.   One of the things that i didn't like about the game was the limited amount of time for side quests (if you don't complete them, the taks will fail, which is kind of annoying especially when you didn't pay much attention to the side missions). Another annoying thing is that there is no sleeping bad in the vanilla game* and you can't see anything during the night so you can't really do anything unless you get a night vision which is really hard to get for the first days of the game. Also, I would have prefered if the map would be just a whole map not a bunch of sections joined together by loading screens. I guess that was due to the hardware limits in 2007.  Overall the game is worth playing and in my opinion the only mods you need to get that will not alter the atmosphere and experience of the game are:  1) Zone Reclamation Project (ZRP) - this is a patch which will fix the buggs which are common in the vanilla game. 2) Absolute Nature - improves the nature in the game. 3) Absolute Textures - improves the appearance of the structures in the game. 4) Weather Overhaul - adds different types of weather such as heavy rain, storm, etc.  5) Shaders Max - improves shadows in the game.   Last 4 mods just improve the game's slightly outdated and blocky graphics.  *The sleeping bag now comes with ZRP (it can be enabled in the modifier in the gamedata).  The game at the beginning is difficult, but after a few hours I guarantee you will get a decent equipment and you will be fine then.  I recommend playing on Veteran difficulty (it's not like COD's veteran in campaign) to feel the hardcore of Chernobyl. The highest difficulty, Master, might be a little too much for some people.

            "review_text": "I really liked this game. Open world FPS with survival elements and light horror.  You have to manage your hunger and continually scavenge for ammo and better weapons. This is a big factor in the early game but towards the end you may find you have tons of everything if you explore well, diminishing the importance of all this somewhat.  The game's atmosphere is the biggest selling point. Wandering the Zone is quite a joy with the ambient noise of nature, cycling weather effects, a constant sense of danger from either human enemies, mutants or anomalies and a day/night cycle. The nights are dark and full of terrors. The AI groups interact with each other dynamically and the world feels like it keeps turning regardless of your own actions. You could return later to people you've done quests for only to find them surrounded by bandit corpses and being eaten by wild dogs.  The ending kind of dips into one man army territory as you fight through endless hordes of enemy soldiers, but that would be my only proper criticism. The game does suffer a little bit with crashing and bugs but nothing particularly serious after being patched. It does look a bit dated now as well, particularly people's faces, but mods go a long way towards making it easier on the eyes.   ------ There's a pretty good modding scene for all the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.  Recommended mods for first time playthrough;  Zone Reclamation Project:- Required bug fixes and optional tweaks. Absolute Nature:- Environmental texture upgrades. Absolute Structures:- Texture upgrades for buildings and vehicles. Atmosfear:- Improved weather system.  I played with just the Autumn Aurora 2.1 mod which is a combination of the above with a couple gameplay tweaks, new guns and other added stuff. Be aware though that when I played the mod had a serious bug with corrupting your saves if your quest log gets too full, so I had to pick and choose side quests a bit, keep multiple backup saves and do a bit more running back and forwards.",

It really nails the feel of being in unknown territory, not sure of what will be around the corner. My time in Cordon, Agroprom, Garbage, and Dark Valley was some of the best time I've had in any game. Lab x-18, is the the high point of this game. The tension in that lab reached unbelievable levels, a tension that sadly was not recreated in later labs and research stations. The game starts to fall apart for me at Lake Yantar. This is the last time you will meet a new type of enemy which are zombies, by the way this is only about halfway through the game meaning for the rest of the game no new enemies will be thrown at you. Lab x-16 had only zombies in it, no horrifying mutants, no tension. The next zone north of the bar, the army camp was semi-enjoyable, sneaking through the bloodsucker village was very tense. But at this point the game becomes very, very linear. At this point the game becomes a mad dash to the finish, side quests are thrown out the window as you make the mad dash from Red Forest through Pripyat right to the Chernobyl NPP. The end of the game saddens me because it could have been so much better. The last three zones are almost exclusivley fighting Monolith soldiers instead of interesting mutants. The game does make up for this with its multiple endings, which are all very nice. Still for all the faults the end game has I still reccomend it due to its cheap price. But for the the authentic stalker experience I reccoment Call of Pripyat with Misery mod.",

I've died atleast 20 times before I finally gave in to the shoot and cover aspect of the game, and even then i kept dying to that one headshot, or going into a new area thinking i can easily take it only to be proven wrong seconds later. The horror aspect of the game outclasses horror titles with the creepy atmosphere of abandoned labs and nuclear reactors, not to mention the top notch sound quality and creative humanoid enemies. The fire fights were long but engaging, faction wars though simple, provided a lot of interesting time, and let's not forget the birth of Cheeki breeki.   Overall I really enjoyed this game and will be heading over to the other 2 and enjoy my time in the zone. Definitely recommended.  Stay cheeki breeki my friends",

Based on the classic russian sci-fi novel Roadside picnic. The game takes place in the exclusion zone surrounding the Chernobyl NPP affected by radiation. The zone is filled with mutants, strange anomalies and S.T.A.L.K.E.Rs who hunt for artifacts created by the radiation.   The game is an FPS with RPG elements as you progress you can upgrade your guns and gear and join various factions that suit your personal pursuits. The guns are quite inaccurate and do break down and the game is especially difficult as you try to fight off mutants, bandits and radiation. The game's real strength is it's immersive and spooky atmosphere that carries through the game.   I heartily recommend S.T.A.L.K.E.R as a fan of atmospheric games as it's a game I reinstall more often than games like Half Life 2 and Deus Ex.",
