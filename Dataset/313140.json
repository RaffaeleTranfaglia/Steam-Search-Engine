            "review_text": "I came across Blackbay Asylum while it was on sale. Being an avid horror lover, I figured why not give this game a chance; I am definitely not disappointed! I currently have nearly 5 hours on record while on Chapter 5, which for those unaware there are 10 Chapters included in the game. The graphics may not be the most amazing you have ever seen. However, you will not be disappointed as the game is packed with puzzles that will not only challenge you, but also test your ability to retain information.   Some people have complained about 'typos' or the fact that there is no ability to save between levels (that's right folks - you have to beat the chapter or it won't remember your progress). Despite the whining of others out there, I found the typos to be apart of the game's charm as you are playing a psychotic killer who obviously is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, lol. I also want to mention that Doug has a very dry sarcastic personality, which can sometimes be downright hilarious as well as borderline offensive; you will see his personality is based on his limited understanding of the world and society in general.  Also, the inability to save challenged me to focus and complete a chapter either in one sitting or retain where all the clues were so when I came back through I could catch-up to where I was quickly. Thus, I would not let a few minor things that people did not like keep you from this awesome indie horror game that you are sure to love. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves horror, puzzles, or adventure in general!",

Dialogs give nice atmosphere and give good picture whats have been going on. Not too long game for checking it out. Game length is most likely in limbo, but puzzles might take some time to figure out. Game script is somewhat very sick minded which makes it more interesting IMO.  I'd like to see sequal from this game :)",

            "review_text": "Starts off promising then goes into frustrating (combination safe puzzle). Uninstalled as many puzzles are not described properly for you to find a logical solution. Lots of bad spelling typos too (didn't the dev think to use a spell checker or does he suffer from dyslexia?). No proper save in between chapters, so if you want to quit you have to either finish the current chapter or start over again. Chosen resolution and windows/full screen option doesnt save either, so that gets a pain to deal with also. Don't bother with this train wreck and buy yourself something with a bit more spit n' polish!",

Unique part is that you face the scares and the danger as a hulking psychopath, yet you can't attack, or use weapons. Cool story but kind of predictable once you see 'Innsmoth Massachusetts'. Odd characters, chilling music, very dynamic, and creepy atmosphere definitely a recommended buy. Would recommended waiting for a sale though as I don't think it's worth &gt;$20.",

Where it was trying to be entertaining I couldn't supress a yawn. And paying more than 5-10$ for it - especially with similar games that are out there - is probably the saddest part of it all.",

            "review_text": "As previous comment mentionned, this game is a horror point and click without the point part. Pick objects, use them elsewhere. However, when I say horror, I mean comedy-horror. Since the character you're playing is a psychopath, everything morbid you see becomes a joke. Made me laugh some times. Is it worth at -66% ? Maybe, if you like the genre.  You should know however that the only way to save your progess is when you complete a chapter (checkpoints are only used in case you die). Puzzles can take a while to get or to find the right 'key' object needed to move on, but in the end, I highly recommend the game as an introduction to more scary games.",

It has uses many interesting and challenging puzzles that will sometimes force you to think like the psychotic Doug in order to solve them. The game also has some horror elements to it, but I found that they were only scary in the first person parts of the game, which are very few. While the game is a fun play, their are parts in were the solution to a puzzle is hidden in a corner and is very easy to miss, making it seem like the game is impossible. I don't think the game is worth twenty dollars though, wait for a sale for the game to take place before buying it if you plan to.",

THERE IS NO SOLUTION TO THIS (at least not at the time of writing this review) !! The game has 3 FPS, the GPU is under 0% load and you're going to be stuck with this for now.  According to posts by one of the devs himself, they're aware of these issues and they've been able to replicate them. That was back in August 22nd 2016. And so far nothing, no one got it working yet.",
