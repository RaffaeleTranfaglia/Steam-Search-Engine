            "review_text": "Great game if you have 4 poeple to play with also supports up to 8 controllers. Me and my nephews had a great time. Ai is pretty good. If you need to add one or 2. You can setup how ever many you want up to 10 players in all. you can even co-op vs a team of a.i. A.i. has 3 different settings. easy, medium, and hard. Not really a good 1v1 game since once a player gets past the other one all they have to do is drive the puck into the others goal with nothing in their way to stop them. It is still playable with 2 humans just have to add some bots, or enjoy the battle leading up to getting the puck past the other player. There are several maps with some features such as spikes,speed boosters, and bouncers that will affect your player if you hit them, these maps may make it more playable in a 1v1 environment. Overall I definitely recommend this game if you have 4 players or more and It's not bad with odd amounts because you can add bots. Don't read too much into the 1v1 complaint I made, just making sure if you buy it you intend to play with a few extra players. It does have a single player challenge/ camapaign also.  As of 2016.. no release of talked about update on forum.. also with windows 10 and xbox one controllers do not function correctly. Seems to be a unity issue also.. cuase I ahve several games that all use unity and have same issue player turns to left even when not inputting any input. It can be fixed by devs... As Knight squad is agame that the dev has fixed this issue with. Be cautious if you do not have xbox 360 controllers. Do not buy if using windows 10 and have xbone controllers.",

            "review_text": "I wholeheartedly recommend buying ClusterPuck '99. My friends and I went out to buy Cards Against Humanity, but ended up coming home with a Steam giftcard to but Crawl with. We had another $10 leftover, so we looked up 'great steam multiplayer games', or something along those linesâ€”and came across this game. We watched the first trailer (not the live-action one) and it peaked our interest. Then we watched the live-action trailer. We were hooked. We experienced some issues downloading it because Steam was experiencing 'heavy load' at the time, seeing as it was Memorial Day. It was well worth the wait. ClusterPuck '99 is one of the best games I have played in my life. I would be willing to give PHL Collective the funds to make as much DLC or ClusterPuck '00 if they wanted (if I had the money, but I'd be willing to work for it). These devs are awesome and so is their game. I can't recommend this enough. Just make sure you have enough controllers, because everyone's gonna wanna play.",
