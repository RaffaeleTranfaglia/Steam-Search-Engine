            "review_text": "Short Version: Do not buy this game. If you want to play Magic at your computer without investing in MTGO, buy DOTP 2014 instead.  Quite frankly WOTC isnt known for quality control of digital products, but this might actually be the worst designed product with their name on it that I've seen (and I played MTG Tactics and MTG Battlegrounds). I finally decided to try this version out, despite all of the negative things I've heard about it. Surprisingly though, its somehow worse than I expected.  The microtransactions arent the real problem here. Certainly they are there, and that is slightly annoying given that the point of the DOTP franchise is to play MTG without that aspect of the card game. However as a paper MTG player I'm certainly used to that.  No, the real problem here is that the game that you are paying for is garbage. First of all, its one of the most abysmal PC ports I've seen in awhile. Instead of a menu screen, you get a series of icons that you scroll through one at a time until you find the one you were trying to get to. Even in game, the mouse controls are strangely less smooth and not as responsive as in 2014. It feels like the function of every aspect of the game has been sacrificed to try to make things look 'cool'.  And since I'm talking about the appearance of the game. It looks horrible. Why is everything on the screen black and grey? Did someone at the studio decide that the colorful blues, golds, and reds of DOTP 2014 were too pleasant to look at? The whole design of the in-game interface is not only far less convenient and poorly laid out, but also just plain irritating to look at. Are me and my opponent playing MTG in some dystopian sci-fi future where joy is illegal?  But so far I've been talking about the interface, gameplay functionality, and apperance of the game; 'what about the actual card game?', you excitedly ask.  Unfortunately its just not worth it. I continuously feel as though Im playing the sealed gameplay mode of DOTP 2014... except with less interesting cards. And this is the 2015 campaign gameplay. Sure being able to make my own deck with random cards is nice, but if I wanted to make a crappy deck with crappy cards I would play sealed mode. Which I can already do in DOTP 2014. And if I want to play multiplayer or the campaign, 2014 lets me play with some fun Magic cards from throughout MTG history instead of the boring trash you get to work with in 2015.  In conclusion, if at any given time I was unable to go out and play paper Magic with people in person, I would play DOTP 2014. If I was unable to play DOTP 2014, I would play Hearthstone. And if I was forced to play DOTP 2015... I would go read a book.  Learn from my mistake, dont buy this version of DOTP. Dont support their horrible decisions. Hopefully WOTC will seriously rethink their poorly implemented digital business model.",

You are stuck with the deck you pick at the start of the game, which I would not be so annoyed with since you are able to customize the deck in its entierity, but some of the cards required to make most archetypes are behind pay walls...  I will finish the campaign by sheer brute force, but every time I play instead of being happy I get to play magic, I get annoyed at everything this game does wrong.",

I've loved every Magic DotP game and have called them one of the best cost to content bargains available for years. That being said, I was fairly happy to shell out the $35 for the complete edition of this game. This leads me to one of my bigger $35 dollar mistakes in recent memory.   This game fails to deliver on so many differnet facets, I get a headache pondering the rant that I want to fill this page with.   To attempt brevity: In the pursuit of making the game more aesthetically pleasing and the touted 'build your own deck' function, they have miserably failed at delivering the experience given in the other DotP titles.   When I start inspecting the 'card collection' available in this game (which I payed a premium cost that would have reflected 2 expansions for games earlier in the series) the true migrane sets in...   I really have more to say, but writing this out is kind of ruining my evening. So, please, take it from me AVOID THIS TITLE.   Thanks.",

If you don't want to pay this then you are locked out of a large chunk of cards.**** Finally adding the ability to create your own deck from a large pool of cards at the expense of every other enjoyable concept in the previous titles is just... well, bad. You start off with a random starter deck, or might as well be random as you can't see what any of the starters have in them till you make your choice. You are then locked into those cards till you grind away for hours opening random packs of cards. What's worse, is even after spending hours upon hours of your time grinding away to unlock your cards, there is still a large collection of cards that are unobtainable unless you spend $1.99 per pack to randomly get your 'Premium Cards'.

            "review_text": "Firstly I've been playing this game since revised and this is the 6th computer version I've played.  So my basic opionions on it.  1. There is no 2 headed giant. A major drawback for some. I miss it, but I can live without it. 2. Terrible starting decks. It's a deleberate game push towards teaching deck tweeking. And it does lend to the true beginners experiance of not having any cards.  3. The automatic funtions as always have to be turned of. I can declaire my own attackers thank you, and I'll choose when I'm done with a stage. I know they use this for beginners, but it's truely as always anoying and useless. Even beginners need to learn how to manage games stages. 4. The card pool of unlockable cards is one of the biggest of all the electronic versions. Still not enough cards for my taste. But a nice big unlockable pool. And don't pay to unlock the cards, just play for them. Easy enough to get everything but the battle packs. 5. Foils again?! Why? Worthless online; you can't trade them for upmarket value like in real face to face and as always they make it VERY difficult to see which card is which on screen.  6. Multiplayer is a bit sparce currently. It may pick up, I suspect though with people still playing 2012 on here, 2013 on here, and 2014 on here; just massively hampers the number of players. And to top that with no 2headed giant available as of yet... 7. There are no stupid slots you have to pay to unlock! WOOP!  Now you take all that.. and it is still a good version of magic online. Well worth buying and playing. If you love deck crafting this is the best version available. Could use a larger card pool, but at least they are giving you a great lake to play in rather than the typical large pond the hand you. I just wish they'd give us the ocean.",

I bought the expanded edition so after beating Innistrad I had access to a whole bunch of cards and could make my own decks, which is supposed to be a advantage of this game over previous versions. But really with the limited amount of cards there's only so many decks you could make anyway. And I'm not getting booster packs for winning, so I guess I'll have to spend more money to get all the cards. At this point I definitely don't feel like I got my $35 worth.

This time I said to myself 'dude, preorder it, 30 bucks includes 5 complete collections!' That was one of the worst decission I made in my game-buying life, if not the worst (right after Fable 3). I wanted to start with good cards right after the first match. I didn't start with good cards, I didn't even know which cards had the starting decks.   Pros:  - More options to customize your decks.  - Higher AI level.  End of the pros.  Cons:  - The game content said 'Complete collection', which doesn't mean complete. It means 'the complete list of the cards we selected'. You get 6-10 colour cards from each collection (6 green cards from Ravnica, 6 from Theros, etc...). If this won't be enough, selected cards are a laugh at your face. And if that won't be enough, you need to fight 6 matches with your starting deck (should I say di ck instead?) to unlock them. And finally, you won't get 4 of each, some will get 4, some 2. Sad, very very sad. Full edition NOT RECCOMENDED UNDER ANY CIRCUNSTANCES, QUARANTINE. - Menus are slow as hell for some reason. - Slowest game of all those DOTP series.  - Random crashes. Game crashes slowly too. - Pay 2 win system, so you figure out where this is going.  - No fun cards at all. Standard standard gameplay, some good picks for the make up.   Do not expect to find:  - Coolest cards from other DOTP games. They are by far much much worse. - Fun right after starting. Farming cards from the ridiculous starting decks could be a pain in the ♥♥♥ (not for me, cause I paid the money for non complete complete collections)   A complete waste of money, should I have read the forums first.

DIDN'T WORK on my computer originally, had to manually edit config files to get it to a workable point. Obvious Mobile port, used to be PC players had to worry about getting Console ports now it seems we have to worry about getting ports of Mobile games with all their touch screen interface stereotypes intact and quite annoying to navigate with a mouse.  But worst of all it has Microtransactions, Thats right microtransactions in a premium games, sure quite a few games nowadays have microtransactions for speed ups, unlock everything keys. this one has premium booster packs which contain cards only in that booster pack and thus completely unattainable, randomized booster packs at that, which retail in game at £1.49.  So good luck sinking money into this game for those booster pack cards or do as i'm sure numerous will do and hack unlock those cards. i'm sure there are ways and someone is no doubt doing it right now.  Wizards or should i say Hasbro, wizards money centric overlord, decided to market Duels of the Planeswalkers as their entry product into magic, something for those unwilling to put down money for physical and in this case they made an apt product it does indeed introduce you to magic with the slight problem that they expect new players to deck build, having remembered my early days of playing magic, i would just modify a store bought deck it was a while before i started making my own decks but game throws the new players right in at the deep end.  TL:DR Edition.  If your a new player don't buy this game, buy last years, it'll teach you more your learn faster and then once you know the stuff... go play the real game keep avoiding this one.  if your already a magic player, still avoid this game for whilst magic dotp used to be a 'level playing field' its not pay to win thanks to 'premium boosters'  Don't believe me check the forums",

This totals to around 25-30 duels. *Online competitive play with up to four people.  Pros- *(Can be) cheap alternative to playing the actual card game. *Construction of your own deck(s). *Quick way to get some games in if you don't have people to play with or don't want to drive to a nearby MTG store.  Cons- *No premade decks to play as. Only to play against. This forces you to grind up for your cards in order to play online efficiently. *The deck building is pay to win. Premium boosters can be bought that include cards you cannot get normally. This is slightly adjusted as you can only have a certain number of copies for any one card (4 copies of any common, 3 for uncommon, 2 for rare, 1 for mythic). * No two headed giant.  This is the 2v2 mode that has been offered in every DOTP game until now and was a huge reason for me to buy it. *The menus of the game are awful. I don't have too much of a problem with this because I use a keyboard but when I do I am easily frustrated. *The decks you are given are just terrible. Consisting of only commons (from my experience) which requires you to get all of your good cards from boosters. *Some of the opening draws you have will force you to restart the duel.  Overall, if your looking for a solo experience of playing against other players with a custom deck you may want to give this a try.

But who cares right? You got your paychecks. I DO NOT recommend this game to anyone. M14 was much better. PS card pool sucks, restrictions you put on the already bad card pool makes for worse. How could you not even put in some of the cards that make M15 so great? Royal screw it, this game is such a screw up.",

However, the 2015 release is a scam. This game has even fewer play modes then the 2014 release and most of the content requires microtransactions. For $10.00 you get one very basic deck. Going through the mundane campaign allows access to booster decks that will provide few to no additional deck building options and are largely made up of unneeded duplicates. To get access to any of the advanced cards that themed decks are centered around you have to pay $2.00 per booster.   If i wanted to pay $100 for a playable game I would have bought the real cards. I bought this product with the intention (based on previous editions) to enjoy the new content without having to commit the amount of money that the real card game requires. Atleast the real cards have the possibility of some resell value.",

            "review_text": "The reviews of Magic 2015, here on steam and throughout the interwebs, have been unanimously negative. I agree with the overall sentiment of said reviews, with special disdain for the increased amount of micro transactions sprinkled throughout the game. Every iteration of Magic since 2012 has had micro transactions as a way to decrease the amount of grinding necessary to unlock cards, but what's interesting about this iteration is that the campaign play-through, including completing every 'exploration' for every plane will unlock most of the cards with very little grinding necessary thereafter. WotC has charged more for unlocking less. The plan, from my perspective, was to lock the player's deck choice, forcing battle after battle against AI opponents with powerful decks while utilizing the weakest form of whichever deck the user selected. The player then is confronted with two choices: sit through loss after loss (you'll lose a lot in the beginning btw) and slowly unlock cards through boosters (some of which may or may not have anything to do with your deck archetype) or pay 20 dollars to unlock every card available in a booster pack normally unlocked through winning matches. There are also cards that can only be unlocked by purchasing premium booster packs.  What one gets from the purchase of Magic 2015 are the campaign, cards, and the ability to fully customize one's deck. Multiplayer has been severely truncated and only now consists of 1v1, 1v1v1, and 1v1v1v1. The removal of Two-headed giant was extremely disappointing to say the least, but I have recently learned that one team can only have a total of 4 of the same card. I don't know much beyond that when it comes to multiplayer rules governing the universe of magic however. Challenge mode has been removed as a category and implemented within the achievements. The issues is that instead of clicking on a challenge without having to worry about decks, one may need to rework one's deck to complete these challenges because specific cards must be utilized. For example, one 'challenge' requires one to kill an angel with Shadowborn Demon. If you don't use a deck that includes black mana, you'll have to modify. Unfortunately, there is only 1 Shadowborn Demon card in this game, making the completion of this achievement based largely on luck and staying power (if the card is pulled late game). I use life-gain by default so I got lucky because I was able to build up enough life to withstand the onslaught; but most of the creatures cast by Avacyn are flying and if decks have no way of dealing with that, it will be a grind.   The animation on every screen is terribly long. Choosing to go forward to another plane or back to the main menu is a chore because the animation cannot be overridden or skipped and it cycles through every choice before going to the first one. For example, if one wishes to go back to the main menu, by clicking 'Esc', to play multiplayer, the animation will start at the end of the selection and work its way down to the first selection. Check the status of your card collection? That selection is close to the end, so one must wait until the animation completes, cycle to 'Card Collection', click it, and wait as the animation cycles through the other choices (about half a second), load, and then display the card collection.   All in all, what one is  paying  for is full deck customization. It's an extremely high price to say the least. It almost feels like a punishment; WotC gave us what we wanted but had to take back other things to justify the action.",

It's no different from any of the years before it besides the card library.  =======================================================================================  The intro is simply annoying. It plays the same whispering wind four times in a row for each of the devs or publishes and their alienware advertisement (because I need top of the line equipment for a digital card game) before finally getting to the intro custscene which repeats the same whispering wind. This one, you have to sit through a few seconds before being able to skip it. We then hit the Start screen where the player is prompted to click start. There is then a two second delay before the fog ever so slowly begins to engulf the screen and take me to the main menu.  I know this sounds like nit-picking but the menues are beyond awful to navigate. Rather than a standard push button menu or even a left and right option, it's uses a front/back layout so you can see the icons for the options behind your current selection, but the icons are just card portraits. How am I to know that 'Dictate of the Twin Gods' is 'Restart Battle'. How about a clock or a back arrow or a curved arrow or something to symbolize restarting. Anyone familiar with the card will tell you that the card has nothing to do with reversing time either, the icons are simply arbitrary to look pretty leaving you to one by one, scroll through your options one by one and read the text underneath until finding what you want. Oh and guess what. The lingering fog is back.  Even if you do happen to manage to memorize the icons, it doesn't make enough of a difference. The one you're on is selected and focused, you cannot see any options you have already passed and any yet to come forward are out of focus and slightly to the right so you can easily click on them. Guess what, it doesn't matter. I can see that icon in the back and I know it is the one I want to click so I'm going to click it but it only shuffles over once to the next option forcing me to click four times just to open the option I want to get to.  2014 gave me a loading screen inbetween menues that lasted maybe a full second at most. I have a 4 gigahert processor, it loaded and then the game started. That's it. Quick and simple.  The game itself has become increasingly annoying as well. The table pulls itself apart like an antique dining table that has an optional insert every time your attack phase comes up and it makes this god awful clang of a forge when it does this. This all happens regardless of whether or not you are attacking. And guess what. That whole nonsense takes another three seconds per turn.  =======================================================================================  In the end, I used to play M14 to kill a few minutes while waiting for my friends to finish whatever they were doing so we could all play the same game. This terrible design couple with these nuisences have ruined that for me as I spend more time looking at WotC's pretentious smoke effect than actually playing the game.

For about the first three fights. After this, you start having to play against real decks. During the interval of time while you get to this point, you are given about 9 more commons.  The first real opponent is a stall deck based on life gain. You can win it basically by getting an opponent with a bad draw. Your deck is totally inferior. For winning this, you finally get a booster pack. If you had Magic 2014, you get two. You can then go wander and play a few more minor enemies and net about another 7 or 8 boosters. Then you get to the stupid fights.  You are now fighting decks composed entirely of rares with no ability to get any more cards. Replaying fights nets you nothing except for the ones against the all rare decks. Obviously, the solution to this is microtransactions. Just buy the cards you are missing.  Obviously, this is a game built in the style of free-to-plays with all of their nastiest tendancies. Wizards should be ashamed of this game.

Instead we get a barebones version of MTG that does everything wrong that it possibly can. Problems are apparent right when you start up the game; the UI is slow and heavily animated, obviously being designed for a touch screen interface. Instead of being given 1-2 prebuilt decks like in the previous two annual releases, you are given a choice between deck archetypes. However, you have no idea what cards are actually inside your deck before you lock in to using that 'Intro Deck'-strength deck which can really screw you over at the start of the game. For example, I picked a supposedly B/G Reanimator deck but the only reanimator card in it was Rescue from the Underworld (a high costed, slow reanimator that requires saccing a creature as an additional cost). Because you are picking an archetype and not an actual deck, you also don't get unlocks specifically for your deck; while this gives you more freedom in deck construction, new players will be baffled about what they should add to their deck or how to edit it properly. A 'Suggested Cards' tool is available but it isn't very trustworthy; using it with my best deck (G/W tokens), two of the three recommended cards are Phytotitan and Pelakka Wurm.  While you can finally build your own decks with DotP 2015, you will really struggle to put something playable together without buying cards for real money. Buying all the cards in the game will cost you $20 and individual 'planes' of cards will cost you $5 each. If you could just drop $20 on unlocking everything in the game you would be looking at spending only $30 total on DotP 2015. Of course, it isn't that easy... many of the best cards available (including Stoneforge Mystic, Doubling Season, Kozilek, and more) are locked behind 'Premium Boosters' which give you 10 random cards for $2 (physical boosters in Standard cost between $2-4 and have 15 cards each). Last year's gambling mechanic was bad but it was only restricted to the Sealed Deck mode. DotP 2015 has essentially become Pay2Win with these boosters because the cards inside can be used in any game mode, including online.  Speaking of online play, there barely is any! 2-Headed Giant has been removed for no reason and no other game modes have been added. You can only play 2-4 player FFA with your custom built decks; no Archenemy, no Planechase, no new modes. With the addition of deck construction and the rise of popularity in Commander/EDH, it is really disappointing that even that wasn't added.  The only good thing that I can say about this is that they finally added non-basic lands. Deck construction is a nice touch finally but the rest of the game has suffered for it. It seems that in order to release the same game on every platform they had to cut content to make it work on mobile devices. DotP 2015 has a tedious, boring, and grindy single player campaign, no Challenges, no multiplayer modes outside of FFA, and no tools to introduce new players to MTG except for the tutorial. This is the worst DotP game made yet (even worse than the original DotP which was removed from Steam) and not even fans of the series should bother with this blatant cash grab.",

Positives include a catchy theme song, ability to construct a deck to however you like, storyline is not a bad inclusion, opening more boosters to provide anticipation and excitement.  Sadly however the negatives definately out weigh the positives.  You are restricted in deck building to a limited selection of cards after you have completed the campaign unless you which ti invest in 'boosters' to increase your card pool. Matching up against others who have superior cards or/even duplicates or sets of 4 card(s) whom have purchased additional boosters, not only makes deck building difficult, ineffective but also increases the likelihood that you will be demorilised over and over again in matches against other opponents in 1 v 1 or free for all matching.  I generally enjoy purchasing this product for the puzzle games, Last turn puzzles a few years ago were amazing and difficult/challanging. 2014 however showcases some very sub par puzzles games and this year, well, there are none.  I played one game of free for all on 4 v 4 and I felt so far away from the game table I requested my flatmate to provide me a magnifine glass. myself and another player also realised 4 turns in that we had already lost when one of the players threw down some superior cards for which we had not even access to.  This put me off continuing playing this game into the future as really there is no point unless I am wishing to invest into this.  Suggestions would be to at least bring 'two headed giant' match making back, a level par card selection by perhaps charging a set $15 fee from the start and not this 'micro transaction booster option' which is poor oversight in my opinion and perhaps even a tournament mode where equal par magic the gatherers could paticipate tournaments of 10 players etc, round robin to then provide a level based system and a decent points rating for those wishing to climb to the top in rankings over time (by winning more tourney's etc)  Rating,  interface, music score, Story concept 6/10 (as what else can you do with a story really) gameplay campaign 5/10 (as well the AI seems to get the perfect run of cards sometimes :S) Deck building feature, 8/10 as this is very flexible Card selection 2/10 (extremely limited unless additional investments made) gameplay vs human 3/10 (for the reason you will become frustate that you are unable to build a deck that is consistent without investment into more booster packs)  Overall I would probably rate Magic 2015 4/10",

You progress by unlocking boosters from winning game. Freeform deck building is nice but the card selection is rather limited and some cards are unlocked only by paying. Coming back to Magic after all these years I enjoyed it but that enjoyment diminished after finishing the single player and reaching finding out how limited the card base actually is.  Finally it seems the game has this awkward way of 'simulating' a good or bad luck streak for either you or the A.I. You may find yourself get numerous horrible initial draws, or fight an A.I. that seems to do absolutely nothing because it lacks the cards it wants to use.  Seems like Magic 2015 has a lot to learn from other modern digital card games. For a game with such a rich history and universe Magic 2015 is simply too limited to warrant it's 10 dollar/euro pricetag.",

So if you want to play online with other people and not just the AI, then you're going to have to shell out.  But you can't really just play against the AI, either. Opponents get stacked hands and decks, and no matter what you do they play the same way virtually every time. Either you turn the difficulty up and play against an opponent with a stacked deck and the skill to wield it at almost perfect effectiveness, or you turn the difficult down and watch the opponent, half the time, defeat himself with absurdly bad plays.  Since starting the game, I have only seen my opponent get mana-screwed one time. I am mana- or at least color-screwed 9 games out of ten. With a control deck. With 27 lands. It could just be ridiculously bad luck, I know, but the sheer number of unplayable hands I see leads me to believe that there is something wrong with the game's 'shuffling'.  All things considered, this game is only fun if you want to buy all the cards and play online with other people. Single player is a joke and, honestly, an affront to a magic player with a decent level of skill, and the cards you can unlock in the base $9.99 game don't allow for any cool decks to be made--and certainly not a deck that can compete with other players online.",

If you already really like Magic and are the kind of fellow who bought every single other DotP game, you're gonna be addicted by this until you've got every single card unlocked (too bad there's the unholy Premium set which costs a small fortune to unlock). However, you will also be very frustrated because this installment in the series is in a lot of ways inferior to the others. In either case, I wouldn't really recommend this game.  If you're new, I urge you to buy DotP 2012, instead. The decks in that one are the best - there are some really awesome decks in that game.  And that already leads me to the biggest problem with this one, in my view. There are enough people who have written about the abysmal way the game starts you off (which, by no doubt, is designed that way to make you pay money to unlock cards quicker). It is abysmal. And it also leads me to my main problem - the card pool is severely limited. I have picked the Black/Red deck at the beginning of the game. It was based around stealing creatures and sacrificing them. One of the best things about Magic in general (and, notably, the other DotPs) is that you get to improve the strengths of your deck as you go along and collect cards. I eventually saw that I was unable to do that. Sure, I got stronger cards which made my deck stronger - but only very few cards improved on the theme of my deck. Eventually, I simply won because I got to draw and play those strong cards, not because I utilized the mechanics and themes of my deck to their fullest. I thought that I just had poor luck with my booster. I didn't. There simply were almost no cards at all which built on that theme. The best permanent card which allows you to sacrifice creatures was already in the deck.  As I found out about that fact, I abandoned the deck and made a series of other decks, which all disappointed me in the same way - there was little possible interaction between the cards, or the interaction was simply too weak to hold up against the extremely powerful decks you fight in the campaign. Even if you just want to make a powerful deck with strong cards, you will find that, for some unknown reason, certain mana ranges only have rather weak or situational cards to offer. Eventually, I managed to make a deck I had fun playing, and also was able to win with, by combining three different colors so as to have more choice in cards (something which I highly recommend if you find yourself in the same position I was in). The card pool is cripplingly small. By now, I have unlocked every non-Premium card and have already taken a closer look at the cards available. A lot of really popular and neat card archetypes just simply aren't there at all, or are extremely underrepresented to the point that their corresponding cards aren't only very poor representatives of their archetypes, but will also take you a long time to find in the first place. Since I have always heavily prefered Red and Black over the other colors, I mainly noticed which of their archetypes fall into this category; these would be: black reanimation, black sweepers, big black demons which require sacrifice, red board-changing sorceries, red sweepers, red creatures which come back from the graveyard, etc. But I have also noticed that decent blue card draw is very hard to come by - let that sink in for a moment. Let's go back to DotP 2013. The decks weren't quite as good as DotP 2012's, but I still clearly remember some of the decks in that game (while I remember none at all from Magic 2014, on a side note). That game made me learn to appreciate Phoenix creatures, and I had turned into a bit of a fan of them. They may not be very impressive as you initially play them, but as the game goes on, you'll be more than happy to find a Phoenix in your graveyard, and some of them lend themselves to some really tricky plays. There's nothing at all which resembles that archetype in Magic 2015, not in Red, not really in any other color, either.  To add insult to injury, if you play the game on the harder difficulty settings, your opponents will have access to strictly better cards than you have. Sometimes, you may find yourself facing off againt a deck using a similar theme as you are, but with much, much better cards, and more cards to fit the theme.  There is also a lack of just plain gimmicky cards. There are very few cards which would lend themselves to have a deck built around them. Give me Coat of Arms or Adaptive Automaton and I will build a deck around whatever creature type I like. Eh, probably not, since I could only put two of either one into the deck because of how the deck building is limited in that regard - you may have 4 of the same Common card, but only 3 of the same Uncommon, 2 of the same Rare, only 1 of each Mythic Rare. In fact, there's very few cards which promote any creature type. From the top of my head, I only remember there being some cards promoting vampire creatures, for some bizarre reason, and also one card making beasts stronger. There's also a creature which makes goblins worse, so there's that.  Even the Premium set sucks. There's some interesting cards, but also some really bizarre picks. The Premium set seems to be aimed to promote mono-colored decks, but with the most boring of cards - cards which simply say they promote a certain color, but don't really fit their color. There's no fun in Mono-Black without Corrupt.  Take it from a maniac who has unlocked everything in the game - the card pool sucks and you won't have a lot of fun with it.",

I don't have any of the cards from any of the packs except the weaksauce deck you start out with and loose with a lot. I'm not sure if you get all the cards from the packs for doing something, or you just need to waste more money on booster because it's not like I blow tons of money on real Magic the Gathering. I just want my $35 worth of cards that they said 'added to collection', not you can get some cards of the blocks that we allow you to get since you got the complete edition.   Pros- 1. Magic the Gathering is always fun to play online with friends 2. Cool that you can build you own decks finally (Not much of a Pro. I explain why in Cons.)  Cons- 1. A little disappointed that the menu is slow. Not that it's to terrible, just dont know why they haven't figured out how to fix that. 2. Complete Edition, is a complete waste of money. SInce I thought you got five blocks of cards free, so you can hop on and play with your friends. Nobody is looking for a long compaing with a weak deck that wins one out of every four times, IF YOU ARE LUCKY....... 3.NO TWO HEADED GIANT!!!!!! I mean come on guys. You have been making this card game since 1994 and you 'missed' the two headed giant mode. I'm not the only one mad about this, especially since this is like the sixth game they have produced. Very dissapointed in this. 4.Game play is still slow, but I am okay about this. 5.You can't actually build a deck since you have to play hours on end just to get some cards. (I know I haven't played much of this game, but this still stand from mt friends opinion)  Overview- I thought this game would be different from the last ones, but they have proven me wrong once again. This is still just as terrible as the last ones. Maybe, just maybe, even worse than the other games. To be honest, make the 5 block collections that I payed for to have in my 'COLLECTION', whatever that means, and use them to make a deck and play with my friends and this game will be amazing. That's all I want. that plus two headed giant. Can't forget that.I think this can be an amazing game, I really do. Please add this to the game and I will change my review.",

That said I have the following to say: (1) Interface with xbox controller is sluggish  (2) Menu layout: Feels like I am using and old school rotary phone… google it  (3) Game board: Most unimaginative piece of ….  (4) Two Headed Giant: I have played against my friends since 1994, I want to play with my friends… I would even want a 4-way 2-headed giant game  (5) Magic Online (Digital) interface &amp; quality sucks: This is way all the veterans are playing this game.  (6) Combine “Magic Online” with “DOTPW” into one game: Have an “Arcade” mode (DTOPW) option and a “Tournament “mode (Magic Online) option with cash prizes and awards. Allow accounts to transfer from the current “Magic Online” game so that users can keep the cards they have paid for already.   (7) The Digital Era is the future and Hearthstone is currently out playing MTG in all areas (already) except in “in-depth game play” (which only comes after years of growth)   In short MTG needs to commit to 1 platform (Digital Era …*cough*) and to offer all-in-one game (Digital &amp; DOTPW) in which they update and upgrade the software over the years.",

In fact, I completed almost everything except collecting the last set of cards.  Pros : great introduction to magic, cheap price if you buy the base game only, deck building tool, online play is fun. Cons : starting decks are weak, buying packs was too expensive and got corrected not long ago, multplayer is 1v1 only.  This game is mostly done for new players because the game phases are very clear and (after some patching) the mana tap is handled pretty good by the computer itself.  I like the Deck building tool but we are quite limited. We don't have access to any complete set which is alright I guess for a small game, but it would be awesome if it was available.  The deck building tool is ok but it would be nicer if you could draw hands to see how reliable those starting hands are.  Online play is fun but they removed the 2v2 mode and maybe some more. I have never been a huge multiplayer guy but 1v1 only is boring quite fast and now it is the only way to get the premium set as far as I know. Before you could buy the premium boosters at 2$ each which imo was too much for a game that is not related to MTGO at all.  I wish this game was linked to MTGO in some way because it would incite players to try the 'real' thing.   The starting deck in this game are very weak. You can complete the game by adding the cards you unlock over time but it will take a while at first. If you are good, obviously it will be easier and you will know what to change but imo this game is not realy the best thing for experienced players since it is too limited. Its fun, but its not enough for them. With that idea in mind, those starting decks are too weak and boring for a new player to realy get hooked.  Well that's pretty much it ... I will just add a part for Wizzard of the Coast in general here ...   They should realy start thinking smarter about their licences. Imo having to buy your cards in real life and then buy them again on MTGO is pure greed. Sure, they need to make money but this has stopped me at least twice from trying MTGO. I spend a lot of money on real magic cards ... I wish I could have a big discount (not free) by entering some code on MTGO and get the cards I just bought. Anyway ... maybe some day. They also need to make their MTGO client better. Its slow right now (beta one I tried a month ago)  ",

            "review_text": "New to the Duels series, so I have only read about comparisons to previous versions (which sound like the 2015 game removed a lot from). Starting from the top, the UI is pretty poor as it forces you to scroll through and suffer long fades. Moving on to the deck builder, while I'm very glad to have the option for complete deck customization, the interface wastes a lot of valuable space and organization options. Additionally, it is rather infuriating (and DEFINITELY WORTH NOTING) that almost every card in the Campaign and AI's decks are not available to add to your own decks - this drives me crazy since the game clearly has the mechanics of the cards built in. However, hearing that the deck builder was not available in previous Duels games is both confusing (since it's so integral to Magic for me) and reassuring - and hopefully being the first game to feature the deck builder can only mean that it will improve with later iterations.  Multiplayer is fun, however hearing that they removed options like Puzzles, Two-Headed Giant, and Challenges doesn't make sense to me and seems like a strange choice to simply trade features rather than improve them.  All-in-All, if you enjoy building decks almost as much as playing the game, then this game is worth picking up. However if you're looking for long term playability and multiplayer (I've enjoyed multiplayer but mainly because I have a group I play with regularly), then I would suggest researching previous versions of the game to determine whether it's worth it for you.",

As someone who is essentially new to MtG, I wouldn't be too familiar of how the game stacks up against earlier DotP versions (not well). Nonetheless, I must say I've enjoyed the game so far, based on a newcomer's experience.  There isn't much of a story structure (which I believe has always been the case since the dawn of MtG), but I felt compelled enough to prod through the missions. Admittedly, the game feels quite quite short, so it wouldn't be too long before you focus just on grinding, multiplayer or achievements. Speaking of grinding, I didn't mind it too much; it doesn't take too long to complete your collection. This is why I don't really consider it p2w if you decide to simply buy the collection (which defeats the purpose of enjoying the game, but w/e).   The card pool is quite limited though; you'll also be seeing cards that campaign duelists have cards that you won't be getting. As a note, there's no replay value for facing these campaign duelists (which is kinda dumb, as some of them have interesting decks).  The tutorial is decent, but not perfect; Google became my friend for even certain basic mechanics. Oh, and I highly suggest not choosing the black/blue deck to start with; AFAIK, it's impossible being the first boss with it, save maybe a hosed situation (try white/red instead). I was kinda annoyed the deck was saved over from the demo, and even more annoyed I had to restart the game (which can't be done through the menu nor re-installation; you need to go into your game folder and remove a particular file).  Despite all this, I still suggest this game &amp; the expansion DLC, especially when it goes on sale.",

I like the way they have made it a little easier to build decks in this installment, most of it is accessable via gameplay, some is not. In the modern world of gaming this is quite acceptable (it seems). I miss planechase and two headed giant, but for the money the game is pretty good. I've played about 35 or so hours and have yet to even start the multiplayer aspect, (this includes the dlc expansion thingie).  Yes. Things are missing. Some of my favorite cards are not included, and they could probably do with more duel-type cards, but it has the feel of a really nice draft session between a couple of guys with two booster boxes between them.  I've even modified some of my cardboard cards to suit the deck scheme (4 Common, 3 Uncommon, 2 Rare &amp; 1 Mythic per card type).  At the end of the day it is up to you to buy this or not, that is the beauty of freedom of choice, however this is a wonderfully bug-free game that works and you can spend many hours playing.  Unlike a lot of games it is quite enjoyable to get the achievements, titles and personas. Most can be gained by playing whatever decks you feel like, others need to have decks built around them. Like all 'Achievements' they are vapid pats on the back, but hey... Who doesn't want one of them once in a while?  The most annoying aspect of this game is that it takes a rather agravating second and a half to load after you click start because of the whooshing fog noise. Gaah! Darn you wooshy fog!  Right.

I read in some other reviews people complaining about how they have to pay extra to unlock more cards, this is false you can actually unlock all the cards in the game by playing the game or buy the 'special edition' and get all the card unlocked if you're lazy. It'll be nice if they'd bring back '2 vs 2' aka 'Two headed giant' multiplayer option in the next game, maybe even a draft option perhaps? Personally I didn't mind them taking it out since I like 1 vs 1 and FFA more. As a longtime MTG fan, I'd recommend the game to anyone who likes card games and fantasy.",

            "review_text": "NOTE: I recommend this game at $9.99 - any additional 'special edition' upgrades or whatever are a total waste of money and should NOT be where your money goes.   What this is not:   - an online replacement/playtesting tool for paper magic players who don't want to pay hundreds, if not thousands to maintain an online collection.  - worth investing more than $9.99 in - designed for PC  - a challenge for real, competitve magic players  If you can accept these things, then you are not going to be disappointed by DOTPW 2015.   It is a short campaign with a decent amount of replay value, it is better executed in 'most' regards vs. the previous iterations of this game. The AI is generally not challenging at all, even at the hardest levels, so if you are a good magic player, and you concede games quickly to poor RNG, you can easily finish this entire campaign in about 3-4 hours (you will note I have 7.2 hours on record, and that includes a reasonable amount of messing around and farming the post-campaign content)   Duels was clearly designed for tablets, so with that said, you may well just want to buy it on a tablet :), as the menus ask you to 'swipe' the screen with your mouse, which is inaccurate to say the least, and infuriating in more cases than not.   What duels of the planeswalkers 2015 has improved on...   The overall game UI is solid, and is an excellent educational tool for those not necessarily too familiar with the game's rules. The mana-tapping complaints I have seen are really not a concern if you pay attention and use mana-cycling. Not being able to target your opponent's cards by default is something you MUST turn off. No spoilers, but there is a specific opponent where your life is a ton easier if you can target their cards. I would also turn off the handicap of allowing the AI to order your blocks for you - but do so understanding that assigning blocks is a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥ so you may well order incorrectly anyway.   The presentation of cutscenes, videos and even some voice acting is new to DOTPW with this edition, advancing on 'motion images' of the previous incarnation. The underlying story of Garruk and his obsession with being a hunter is nicely realized and while the transitions from plane to plane are a touch, weird, it's all good and nothing that detracts from the overall story experience.   The collection management has decent filtering, the packs you get after each victory generally have at least a couple of good upgrades for your current deck, and by about plane 4 or so, you do get to have some real flexibility in adjusting your deck to handle the current task at hand (i.e. sideboarding in artifact or enchantment removal, etc)   The whole deck building interface is quite basic, however. So don't expect it to make it easy for you to see your deck at a glance.   Who is Duels of the Planeswalkers 2015 for?   anyone who is generally speaking a fan of Magic the Gathering, but is on the more beginner to intermediate side. The tutorial is good, the tool tips are accurate and useful, and the overall experience is very much intended to hand-hold the player with less experience. If you pay attention well enough, you will get a good introduction to core concepts such as the stack, correctly timing your instants and abilities and attacking before playing cards (something the AI does, and the game correctly (for the most part) recommends to you).   Anyone who is a bit more skilled who feels that $10 is a decent value for 7-10 hours (or more if you really get in to the multiplayer aspect) of magic-based entertainment.   It is sad to note the loss of the puzzle/challenge mode. This might have been a mistake to exclude since such things are generally speaking one diversion which entertains the more advanced player.   Keep your expectations low, and this game will be pretty much everything you want - and it's a heck of a lot more fun to play than full fledged Magic the Gathering in the recently launched v4 online client!",

This is Magic the Gathering, but unfortunately kneecapped for reasons unknown. First, the interface is clearly not designed for PC use. It is very, very obvious that it was meant for swipping motions on a tablet or smartphone. 2014 had a similar problem, though not nearly as bad. The UI is also clunky. It takes way longer than necessary to perform mundane tasks.  The problems in gameplay start off with the starter deck. You get a vague description of the deck style, then you get a bunch of crappy cards. Compare to 2014, where the decks started off good and only got better. While being able to fully customize your deck is good, you're again kneecapped by the slow and random progression of acquiring cards. Add to that that the best cards are locked behind micro-transactions and it's a fairly miserable experience. The fact that you have the option to purchase sets for real money that you can fully unlock through gameplay is also a kick in the balls.  The story mode is a big crapshoot. You generally don't have a good enough deck to beat the main bosses right off the bat, and some of them use cards that you can't even get, like scry lands. You end up having to grind exploration zones to get more cards until you either get lucky or can hard counter the boss's deck. The exploration itself is random too. My very first experience was an opponent that used Pyxis of Pandemonium. Only Pyxis of Pandemonium, a card that isn't even usable. until turn 7 (assuming no land drops are missed). Others can kick your ♥♥♥ repeatedly.  I don't really know who this was made for. Veterans will be disappointed with the card pool and overal gameplay, while beginners will learn better with 2014.",

Wish there were more cards to make themed decks easier to build though.   They could allow us to use all the portraits we come across, not just the ones we have now. Some of the AI, achivement, or title portraits look really nice, but you can't use them. Shame, as it would add some extra incentive to go for them. You do unlock some personas, but they're mostly rehashed from earlier versions.  There's still a fun game here, especially in multiplayer. It's just a shame that it's hidden under many inconveniences that add up over time, and monotone grinding (to be fair, it's faster to unlock everything than in 2014).  ---  I had more fun playing the Hearthstone expansion Curse of Naxxramas for 4 hours than I did playing the single player of this for 16 hours.

Although It May be Just To Compete With Blizzards Card Game HEARTHSTONE, They Have Executed It Rather Well In My Opinion. Some Of The Newer Cards And Some Of The Synergy Is Pretty Incredible.  It Brings A Refreshing New Section To The Game To Which Has Usually Just Been A Re-Release Of The Same Game Year After Year.  The Single Player Is Longer And More Enjoyable As It Feels The AI Is Now Alot Smarter And Makes Matches Harder Which is Definately A Good Thing As The Older Magics ( 2014 And Earlier ) Were Fairly Easy.  And Now Onto The Only Con I Have Really Found. THE MENUS. THEY ARE VERY SLUGGISH TO TRAWL THROUGH. But Other Than That It's An All Round Superb Game. For Just £6.99 It It Such Great Value In My Opinon. Especially With The New Features.  Anyway, A Short Review Of The Things That Stood Out To Me.

            "review_text": "So I've gotten a decen amount of time with this game, and I'm going to say its far an away an improvement over the previous styles of the game. First I'll get my main gripes out of the way.  1. No Two Headed Giant multiplayer mode. This was a great game mode, no idea why they didn't include it, it was in the two last versions of the game. Just plain, WTH?  2. The menu system/UI. There is a lot of animation and blur effects while navigating meus that are unskippable and take time. Basically 5-8 seconds to go from one menu to the next section. It's annoying at it's worst. Also there is a blur/field of focus effect in game that makes cards illegible unless you zoom in on them. It can take 15-20 seconds to back out of all the menus far enough to quit out of the game. Also just annoying but not game breaking.  3. The sopratic advertisement for the MtG 2015 core set. They will flash this ad at you in game, maybe 1 out of 5 matches that you launch. It's mildly annoying.  4. No more creating a deck of 40-100 cards. All decks have to be 60 cards. Not sure why they did this.  5. No longer a 'random deck' option during a match. I used to love having it pick a random deck to play with.  6. Premium Boosters. So they're geting into the pay to win category with this. (Given that the physical card game is quite inherently pay to win) But you pay 2 dollars to get a booster of powerful premium cards you can't unlock otherwise. This is bound to ♥♥♥♥ off other opponents online if you play with decks relying on these cards.  7. There are key vital cards missing from MtG 2014, that the NPC players will use against you, like Rampant Growth, and the artifacts that heal you for each color card you play. (Maybe they will get added to the Premium card collection later?)  Everything else is golden, it's basically the Magic game I always wanted them to make. You no longer 'unlock decks' and then grind through 40 wins with that deck to access all its available cards, and then customize the deck with only the deck specific cards. All that is gone. Now you start with a premade decks, and with every win you get a booster that earns you cards to your collection. Then you can go an make a custom deck from your collection, with NO LIMITATIONS! Build any damn deck you want, you're no longer trapped in premade template decks. Also the Sealed Deck concept is gone, because this new way of custom decks makes it obsolete.   I've read reviews complaining that there is less in this game than previous iterations. When it comes to Two Headed Giant I agree. And yes the Challenge mode is gone, but to me I couldn't care less, it was a silly thing, a puzzle game made from magic cards that was all about precision timing. Everything else, is a consolidation into a more functional and efficient format. It's kinda like arguing that 1 lb of popcorn is more better than 1 lb of gold, because it has much more volume. Volume doesn't mean value, and this game has more value.   Previous versions had the 'grind' as I described to unlock every card in a deck, and this game has a grind too, but it is much more pleasant. It is the grind to unlock as many cards as you can to complete your collection. You're now unlocking cards that go into your universal collection that you can use in any number of custom decks. That makes tham way more valuable, and you time way better spent unlocking them than in previous games.   Overall: 9/10",

Finally, we can make our own decks, the way we want to, and collect cards; instead of just unlocking predetermined cards for predetermined deck builds.  My only complaints are that they took a step backwards in terms of the in-game menus. in 2014 they gave us a snazzy list menu that was easy to navigate quickly. However in 2015 they reverted to a scroll-through menu with giant pictures. What's worse is that other than what you have selected, all other pictures are blurred and the text for them disappears so that you cant tell what is forward or backwards other than remembering what and where they are. The other things that bother me are the bright white screens which are bad for people with migraines. Last but certainly not least, every time you complete a multiplayer game, all players are booted back to the multiplayer menu rather than a lobby. This forces you to recreate a game every time, and reinvite your friends every single time. What's worse is that it STILL does not remember that you want your player slots set to PRIVATE, making you take extra steps to kick random joiners that get in before you can set all spots to private and then invite friends.  All in all, custom deck building completely outweighs these issues. Just depends on how much annoyance you can deal with.",

If you do it will unlock everything you earn in the campaign, you can earn all the DLC. If you have played any of the others (2012-2014) it is the same thing they did with the DLC in these games.  The game itself is the best in the series since Planeswalker or MTGO. You can build your own deck finally with only being restricted to the number of cards you have unlocked(you can only have 4 in a deck). You can unlock cards in Booster packs that you earn through beating the trials during the campaign. One thing I noticed that I haven't seen in the other reviews is that each realm has an explore option i.e. explore Ravinca. This will give you a different opponent each time not found during regular Campaign progression (until you unlock all the cards) and each time you defeat one of these foes it will give you a booster pack with new cards. However, there is a limit to how many booster packs you can earn per plane and achievements for earning all the packs per different planes.  From what I have seen it is only getting bad reviews because of the fact that people buy all the DLC with the game and go to play it only to realize that everything is already complete. DO NOT BUY THE DLC. Other than that it is an excellent game for single player MTG fans  ***EDIT*** You will have to buy Garruks expansion. it is only one plane with the cards delved the same. other than that it it is the only dlc you can not earn....in This expansion you are limited to using Garruks deck(through the first play through).   Also when you play online you WILL get your cards when people leave the match early. They fixed it so AI takes the players place and will continue to play.

Like som others on the forums, I also assumed that there was a glitch preventing me from using the decks I paid for until I looked up that you had to progress through the capaigns to unlock them. The campaigns are relatively easy though, and it isn't hard to unlock the cards. If you get stuck on one of the later campaigns try switching your booster cards around.   Unlike other players, I like the interface, and don't mind the slight delay between menu switching. Once you get used to it, you start to adapt by hitting escape instead of using the mouse to back out of some menus. Using both the keyboard and mouse made the navigation more fluidic for me. If Stainless Games decreased the time it took to switch menus, that would be even better through.   The AI isn't perfect, and makes mistakes when you solo, but humans make mistakes too. The AI rarely makes miskes though, and I haven't played any other game where the AI is flawless anyways. The deck builder is excellent, and the gameplay interface is also superior to many other card games out there.  Overall, this is a solid game, and worth my money. Some of the criticisms about Magic 2015 I have read are valid, but for me at least, those problems are not game breaking enough to post a negative review, and depends on how sensitive you are to interface details, profit models, and minor gameplay mechanics. The argument against pay-to-win isn't baseless, but ignores the fact that almost all card games you download on a computer have a similar profit model at heart. In this market it would be highly unusual for any other profit model to exist. As a result, it is to be expected, and shouldn't be a shock to players at all unless this is their first time buying a game that uses microtransactions. Selling a NEW game with a relatively popular title for $9.99 should be a clear indication that the company intends on using microtransactions to pay for the rest of their overhead in making the game. There are also other clues such as player defined tags in Steam, and forum comments, so I am not sure why so many people were surprised about this, and reeled so hard against it after they bought it. This is how the real card game works as well, right?   If you are on a budget, and can't afford anything more than $9.99, then you most likely will still get $9.99 of enjoyment out of the game before you get bored of the grind or how the interface works. If you can afford the microtransactions, or even the $19.99 or $34.99, then you will get that much more enjoyment compared to other games with similar price tags.",

Having the opportunity to play the colours I like, and build the deck I want to play from humble beginnings to wiping-the-floor-with-Garruk powerful was a lot of fun, and it added another scale of challenge to the game. As a fan of previous Duels of the Planeswalkers titles, I didn't feel it was too much a stretch from them at all, and though only starting with one deck can be frustrating, you have the opportunity to create more as you play. By the time I finished the main campaign, I had 3 decks, and had turned the Blue/Black deck I started with into a Blue/Green one that I was more comfortable with. It can feel a bit slow at the start, and your deck may seem woefully underpowered compared to your opponents, but isn't that the point of a game? Start small and work your way up? If they just gave you a powerful deck at the start and said 'Go punch this guy', would you be as satisfied as you would be when you nurture your deck into a well oiled machine of destruction? The duels themselves are no slower than the previous games, and in fact many of them felt a lot faster overall. I had to stop the timer repeatedly to drop in spells, which to me, felt more realistic than having your opponent wait extensively after every single trigger. Finally, the money aspect. I found it wasn't too prevalent at all, and while yes, you can buy more cards, it is in no way a necessity, and it doesn't garuntee that you will win in any case. There are more than enough cards available in the regular sets that put the premium ones to shame, and anyone who thinks 'There's no way to beat a premium deck Q.Q' is kidding themselves, and needs to take a better look at the cards they're given. For casual players, it can seem a bit daunting, but the tutorials provided give a very thorough understanding of everything you need to know, and while they may seem frustrating for experienced players, they are a necessity as with most games.  Overall, I highly recommend this game, it's fun, engaging, and overall more challenging that previous DotP games.",

Many people don't seem to understand that in order for this to work, it is necessary for us to begin with a chosen starter deck, and then earn the rest of your cards. You can easily farm new cards in the first node of every level to enhace and perfect your deck. Also, many do not stop to check the default settings in the options menu. I found it best to try different settings that would benefit my playstyle the best. For example, I believe that you should be allowed to adjust the amount of lands by default on the deck creation screen. Also, it should be easier to understand how to choose which mana to tap for all spells, rather than let the game choose for you.   With that being said, of course I feel there some grey areas that should be addressed. I do not mind if WotC/Hasbro wishes to sell extra booster packs, but all of the cards should always be available to earn in game at a reasonable drop rate. We already payed for the game. We should not feel forced to pay more for it. The artwork is very nice, but whats up with the brilliant white screens? I didn't check but also can I change the card table? Also, I imagine there will be an expansion pack with more things to do like two headed giant, but will there be more new cards? I would also like to see a few more of the older edition cards like lightining bolt, and classic counterspell cards. One final gripe is that I seemed to have trouble connecting to a multiplayer game. It just seems to time out.   Anyway I would recommend this game if you like Magic the Gathering, but I would probably wait for an expansion pack or two to come out to fully appreciate it.

After that collecting cards is fast and easy. Campaign can be replayed with a mission called 'explore [plane name]' i.e: Explore Ravnica, available on each set of missions for one booster pack. There are five sets of missions via campaign. Booster packs offer 14 cards with one rare. That's a lot for getting cards.  Multiplayer battles offer a booster pack after each win. Have a friend? You can easily grind matches to get boosters. Boosters are also offered after almost all campaign missions first time through. There are many new cards and more in general from previous editions of Magic the VG.   There are so many bags of tricks available for seasoned magic players to enjoy an online version with slick U.I and graphics, mostly intelligent A.I and its relevant! that is worth the cost of money.

            "review_text": "Magic 2015 is a game based on Magic: The Gathering where you collect cards, build decks, and battle opponents. They've made several Duels of the Planeswalkers games, and I've played all of them.  Magic 2015 is a huge step forward for the series, yet also a huge step back. It's really pretty frustrating.  This game finally implements the one feature people have been asking for since the beginning: the ability to make a custom deck from scratch. You get a pool of cards that builds over time, and you can build your own deck out of the cards you have, and it's a major improvement. The game has several ways of helping you build a deck, or you can hand-select each card, like I did.  If it wasn't for that, though, this game would be among the worst in the series. There's a somewhat diverse selection of opponents, but the difficulty curve is all over the place. It puts you against a big green deck really early, and that's a tough deck to face with only a handful of starter cards. The puzzle mode from previous games is gone. No alternate play modes either, such as Archenemy or Sealed from previous games. What's worse is that the card pool, even when you've unlocked everything, just isn't quite diverse enough, so there aren't that many great decks you can build out of it. If my opponents can make a Sliver deck, why can't I? As a side note, the menus in this game are really slow and animation-heavy. Magic 2014 had way better UX design... what happened?  The microtransactions in this game aren't as bad as the infuriating Sealed Deck mode in Magic 2014 (I'm still mad about that), but they keep a few cards locked out of the main game unless you pay more to unlock them. They're good cards, too. The white Paragon, for example, would be an amazing inclusion in the Convoke deck. I think they're usable in multiplayer too, so this could be called a pay-to-win mechanic (you can still build acceptable decks without those cards, but they really help).  There are two other pluses that I haven't brought up yet. Fighting random opponents in single player is a good inclusion. I wish there were more, though... there are only a small number of opponents per location. Also, as someone that follows the card game's storyline, it's nice to see what actually happens to Garruk (and Ob Nixilis).  Ultimately, I would still recommend this game if you're interested in Magic, though I don't think I could recommend it over Magic 2014. They're not asking for much with the $10 price tag, and I don't regret having spent the money on this. Magic is still fun. Also, it's nice to build decks from scratch for a change. For now, steer clear of the extra paid content.",

Deck building, although a much wanted feature, lacks alot. The card pool is minimal and doesn't allow for alot of variation, the collections feel like they're pre-built decks from previous games. Multiplayer gets boring quickly, 1v1 doesn't feel that competitive whilst 4v4 is a bore. No 2HG is a big let down. Lots of features are broken, namely the shop and also a click to see the leaderboards results in CTD.

Unlike every other review I've read for the game by people who are immidiately unpleased by the UI or Gameplay, I say it is acceptable.  Firstly, lets discuss what they did well. Now, they did nothing exceptionally, but, a lot of what they did do they did on par. The UI, often credited by even the haters as 'fancy'(although sometimes to a fault), does a good job of reflecting the set the game was built around. As a matter of fact, I feel the team that put together this game was in much closer contact with the group that made this core set of magic. However nice it is seeing old cards and gimics in a Duels of a Planeswalkers game, it isn't really reflective of magic at the time, and if some one would use this game as a learning mechanism to get into magic, I believe it is more important for them to know what to expect from the sets of cards they are getting into. Not some crazy infinite turn combo that they will never be able to pull off without putting in time and money to get old cards that they can't even use in standard which is a common starting ground for new players.  The gameplay is exactly what I'd expect from a Duels of the Planeswalkers game, it plays just like its predecessors. With their special scenarios and silly at times AI. The story, unlike past versions of this game, does actually exist. Is it deep? No, but, the fact that it exists at all is a step in the right direction. I haven't dabbled in the multiplayer as of yet, but I'm certain that plays just like past versions of the game as well. The lack of 2-headed giant is a negative factor, but not game breaking.  The 'Pay to Win' controversy that seems to be surrounding this game is unfounded. Looking at the cards you can get by buying the premium booster packs the game offers you is simply a way to 'step up' your game. Not skip the staircase all together and become a god of the multiverse. If you've played sealed, it's simply exanding your sealed pool with cards of similiar or worse value. You do not need to buy packs to win, and can be just as succesful with the game if you don't want to open your wallet past the 10$. Tied in to that 'Pay to Win' mind set people are getting into is the deck building, which is exaclty what they promised. I for one am more excited for future DLC that expands the card pool in this game then I ever was waiting for new pre-made decks in previous games. The most important question for many of you though is, is the game worth the 10$ pricetag? If you've been a purchaser of past magic DOTP games upon release, I'd say yes. This game offers a unique experience, which seems to be off setting to many people who have played past games, but I've become fairly fond of the game. Hopping on and playing it as much as I did any of the previous versions. If you are some one who would otherwise usually wait for a sale, wait for the sale. Overall, I do recommend this game.",

There are no decks to unlock, only boosters to collect. Beware of the difficulty levels, as this year the game comes with a ton of challenge. For me, the challenge comes from the feeling of being short handed with the cards I have. My decks simply can't be good enough to beat some of the planewalkers, no matter how I build them. A lot of time has to go into grinding boosters.  I am dissapointed that the blocks in the game do not include all the cards in their respective sets. The each block has about 45 cards each. While including every card would have been a staggering task, I can't even build most decks I had in real life from the zendikar block (or the other blocks for that matter).

This one is more aimed at the die hard deck builders and casual stratagists than the casual players 2013 and 2014 aimed at. That said, it still feels like some things are missing. With the loss of 2HG there is no longer any reason to sit down and play with a friend, this was a huge tactical error in my oppinion, as that mode was the main reason I recomended last years verion to friends. The other big missing piece for me, is all the cards you see used that are not available in the game. I know it's not cost effective and there will never be an MTG game that contains huge set lists, but if you're going to show me something in a game or have me using it in a tutorial mission, allow me to unlock it. Howerver, like all games it has it's pros and cons.  Pro's:  Battle UI - it just feels better and has a much crisper look and feel than the last two year's version.  Deck builder - Finally, you can make your own deck the way you want it within the restrictions of the card list  Booster unlocks - there's just something about getting to open a booster pack of random cards after a duel that makes you want to keep going...much better, imo than single card unlocks  Longer campaign play - having to unlock lists of cards and trying to get 4 of each ensures you stay in the campaign mode beating down random opponents for much longer than you ever did in 2013 or 2014.   Cons:  Storyline is still lackluster - you will find yourself skipping most dialog just to get on with it.  Weak starting decks - if you showed up with any of these starting decks to a friday night magic, you'd be laughed out of the building. It takes a couple hours of gameplay to get a decent deck going, and your still going to have to get use to restarting a good amount of the duels.  Lacks beef - there are good cards, staples and new, but there just aren't enough concept cards to really go full on with a stratagy, you will end up with filler cards to cover things that you just don't have available. This also brings about the existance of pointless cards.   So, with that said. I recomend this game to the solo players, deck building enthusiests, and those that frequented the multiplayer. If you are an avid 2HG with friends, stick to 2014. And if anyone from the design team happens to check this(doubtful), get on some dlc or a patch to give me that pacifism that appeared in my tutorial deck but isn't available in the game.",

I've played my way through most of the Innistrad block of the campaign using the Life &amp; Death deck, and I will say this: it's different.  DotP15 is more difficult than its predecessors, but it also allows for more freedom. The cards you unlock do not seem to be predetermined and automatically added to your stable of cards. Instead, each win nets you three cards from the zone you are playing in (Innistrad, Theros, Ravnica, Zendikar) which, if they fit with your deck's colors, you can add to your deck.  The tutorial caters to uber noobs and forces you to make potentially bad decisions in deckbuilding. For instance, trading out a 7 mana Resolute Archangel for the 2 mana Raise the Alarm is a superbly horrible decision. The Life &amp; Death deck has so much other fat to trim it isn't even funny.  But in this game, you are a noob again and it will take time to build up your collection.... unless you want to drop some more cash. Perhaps the reason people don't like this game is that it recreates the experience of being a new magic player a little TOO well?  PRO TIPS!!! -- based on a lot of the negative reviews I have seen so far. You CAN change the mana that is tapped when casting a spell with colorless mana. Hover over the spell and wait a second and the mana that will be tapped by default will be highlighted. Tap the left stick to cycle the possible mana combinations.  Also, those people who complained of the menus going slow, use a controller. DotP was made to be played with a controller, and tapping A will cycle past most of the menu transitions.",

There is a huge riot over the lack of 2 headed giant, I don't like this mode however I feel programming wise it would not have taken a huge effort to put in.   The menus are horrid. You have to scroll through these awful diamonds that look pretty at first but then swells your anger as you attempt to navigate to your destination. In 2013 the menu was less visually impressive but much easier to deal with.   Yes the starting decks are crap but I have often found playing and winning with crap cards at first to be the most fun thing in duels. Perhaps as a modern/legacy player I have grown tired of the uber combos and turn 3-4 wins in the format. There is a certain elegance to using a card that is massively overcosted to achieve victory, pulling off combos you didn't even know existed with cards you most likely have never used.   Overall the game is fully functioning with very quick load times. (I am playing on a freaking intel integrated laptop the trick is to use windowed mode and turn down the resolution) Due to some of the problems I kind of wish steam had a 'meh' option but I would recommend this game due to the fun I experienced playing it.

In 2014 I destroyed the AI, and now the AI is super difficult. It's a $10 game, and I found it really fun. Basically it's like a new Madden. Some people will like it, others won't. The campaign is a good 10-12 long and you have to grind for the cards. So all the people complaining about grinding for cards...why did you even buy the game? Just get some friends and play for real. It really isn't too different from 2014. Good, solid card game. 8/10 Should add card trading and actual planeswalker cards.",

Avacyn can bring out her emancipation angel turn three and return cathedral sanctifier to her hand and bring it out for another three life.  I have been playing against Avacyn for over two hours and finally lowered the difficulty to no avail.  One game I had her. Turn 7. I was going to win. She has no creatures out and no cards in hand. I had two 2/3's and a 1/1 poking her every round. She draws and miracles the Mythic Rare angel card and summons four 4/4 angels with flying onto the battlefield.  I cant change decks. I cant get my boosters that came with the game until i finish the Innistrad Chapter. I cannot earn new boosters. This is all kinds of frustrating and annoying.  7/17/14 -- One day later.  After two more games with Avacyn I finally got past her. I was rewarded with many useable cards from the promised booster packs. I am in Shandalar now... second to the last single player realm. I have not earned an additional booster pack since. Is there any way to earn more cards? Or is this a pay-as-you-go kind of game? I will post when I find out.  7/17/14 --- Continued...

            "review_text": "Game Score: 7/10  Magic 2015 is one of the games that I've been looking forward to. I've noticed that many people would not recommend this game on steam due to the 'pay 2 win' accusations. The truth of the matter is that, if you like to play Magic and don't want to pay a lot for the cards, then this is the game for you. At first the game is really hard and it does feel like a pay 2 win game. But, after playing more and more, I've made my very own deck, because that's a new feature in 2015, and I feel like I'm having a lot of fun.   Pros: *Customizable decks (build your own) *Feels and plays like the card game *Makes you 'grind' like an RPG to get better cards *Good viusals and is great for new players to learn the game  Cons: *Resolution issues *Buggy in places here and there *Rather hard even in the tutorial *You start with one pre-built deck that you can't review  So I'd say that this game is made for new to veteran players. It's fun and doesn't cost a lot to play. People are complaining that the game is 'too hard' or 'pay 2 win' but, in reality, you just need to play the game and you can change the difficulty of the game in the options menu.   Another issue people are complaining about is that the Lands get tapped for you when you are playing a Spell. Let's say a card costs one green and then any other and you have two green Lands and a red. In your hand you also have an Enchantment that costs one green as well. The computer, most of the time, will use the two green Lands to play the first card leaving you with the red Land left over causing you to not be able to use the Equipment Spell that turn. To fix this problem, just hit the CTRL key on the keyboard. It will go through a cycle of combos of Lands that you see fit to the situation.  Overall, I believe that Magic 2015 is NOT a bad game at all. They may have removed and changed things here and there, but it's still a good game. I'd give Magic 2015 a 7/10 score. This is because of the lack of the first deck's information given to you and how hard the tutorial is.",

AI takes forever to make decisions,  gameplay- i started on hardest setting. ran through the campaign. its ok i guess i don't think anyone cares about the story. i started with black/white lifesteal. then i moved on to mono red after i unlocked enough cards. then i made another white/black, just did a black/red. its fun. i love it. am i going to miss 2hg? not really. i haven't played against other people but im sure its the same everyone will be grinding out games to unlock all the cards first.  i was annoyed that tablets got this game for free but i say its worth the 10 bucks, but not really worth spending past that except if you really want the pay to win 'premium' cards.

Here you win boosters with random cards that might give you a good deck, but you can't keep winning boosters so once you got 1 or 2 decks that are outstanding you don't feel motivated to try to go back much.

            "review_text": "Magic 2015: Another entry in the 'We know you want Cockatrice but we're not giving it to you' school of M:tG games.  Compared to 2014 (in my opinion, the best of them since 2012, still not saying much), the game is, overall, a complete step backwards with few exceptions. Near as I can figure, 2015 has a grand total of three positives going for it:  * The initial deck selection isn't bad. You pick your base color, and then a modifying color (yes, you basically do have to start with a 2-color deck, but you can get around that fairly quickly -- see below). The base/modifier colors do create different decks, even if you swap the order; for instance, I started out trying Black/Blue, and ended up finding the Blue/Black deck being closer to what I wanted. So you've actually got a pretty good range of selections from the current Standard lineup to build from.  * You CAN, actually, create a completely custom deck from your available card pool in 2015, which is a MASSIVE improvement. So, play through the campaign a bit, unlock some cards, and then build something resembling the deck you actually want to play.  * If you're really tacky, you can simply buy foil 'stickers' to apply to your deck, 30 for $1. So for $2 you can have a whole-foil deck, land included. Normally I'd say this is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, but considering they're digital cards, screw it, if you want your deck to be obnoxiously holographic, go nuts. It's cheap.  That being said, the negatives:  * Overlay/gameplay-wise, not much has changed since 2014. The actual gameplay is the exact same (taking a page from Madden here I think), but the menus have a fairly annoying 'wipe' kind of effect when you click on something that doesn't initially show that your click actually registered. A pretty minor grievance, but a grievance nonetheless. Oh, and by the way, if you want to cycle which mana you tap, the button you're looking for is LCtrl -- which makes no sense, since otherwise everything is accomplished via mouse. Everything. Except for that one ♥♥♥♥ing button.  * Simple, small things that were in previous incarnations' campaign mode just aren't there. The small, gimmicky side-matches you could play either for the ♥♥♥♥ of it or to unlock more cards just aren't there anymore. I have no idea why -- it would take hardly any manpower for the devs to have included an 'all-Plains-and-Suntail-Hawk' deck -- but they didn't. The little challenges like that, parallel to the campaign, helped spice it up a bit, especially if you're struggling against a certain deck. But, again, you can build a completely custom deck to handle it if you'd like, so I suppose that's a minor trade-off.  * Multiplayer is lacking in so many damn things, and this is really where the game ♥♥♥♥s up. All you can choose is how many players, 2-4, are in the match; no alternative rulesets like Two/Three-headed Giant are even options. This goes without saying, but if you were hoping Commander/EDH, or anything other than (basically) Standard would be available, you're screwed. Hope you like the 2015 set because that's pretty much all you get.  * Oh, did I mention the Sealed Play feature of 2014 seems to be completely gone? Granted, if you can make a complete custom deck, I'd rather do that, but in order to get the cards you want you have to truck through the campaign -- which is, needless to say, not the same thing at all.  Magic 2015 is, generally, a step back from 2014, in my opinion. Too little, too late, Wizards added in custom decks and stripped the hell out of other features many players enjoyed. If custom deckbuilding was all it would take, there's no reason for the DotP games to even exist -- M:tgO and Cockatrice both provide that. If you spent the time and/or money in 2014 to have a handful of solid decks, stick with it; 2015 simply isn't worth the money to migrate. If you haven't, meh, give it a shot if it's cheap. It'll probably be the last game of its sort since Wizards recently announced that they won't be publishing Core sets anymore and the Standard rotation will cycle about twice as fast in the actual card game now, so... it's probably time to just play other formats, honestly.",

You can build your own deck for the story modes in this one which is fun and a nice change of pace. That said, the cards on offer are not especially interesting so far as magic cards go and I found most games very slow and ploding as I worked my way through. Only towards the end had I collected enough cards to make a deck that had real focus and some combo potential. Compared to other online card games it just felt stilted and dull and I know magic need not be like that.  The UI is not great for a PC game, very touch screen oriented which feels awkward with a mouse, but it is better than the last outing of the series.   The story felt especially threadbare and dull, not that you really play a game like this for that aspect of it but it stood out as needlessly weak.  I am disapointed there are no puzzles. This was a highlihgt for me in past games in the series and for me very much missed. It does appear to have robust multi player options, but I simply wasn't interested so I did not try it.",

For something new? - No, few fun hours with new decks, that's all.  Do I recommend it? - If you absolutely loved 2013 and 2014, I'd say buy this, but 2013 and 2014 were far better. I enjoyed 2015 some ten hours or more, but it's not 2013, or even 2014. If you're new to magic, grab 2013, that's best incarnation, IMO.",

Everyone can play and learn the game ruleset in an easy way. Also this game has the deckbuilder feature that adds more fun to the package.   The most common complaint is that you have to grind your way to earn all the cards in all the collections. That it's true. But I don't think it's a bad downside. Every time you win a duel you're granted a virtual booster with new cards. It's somewhat exciting opening the pack and hope for some new badass card to add to your strategy. It's a way to introduce new players to the strategy building side of the game. I'm ok with that.  The thing you have to really mind is the choice of your starting deck just before the last tutorial duel. Yes, one deck and that's all. You will unlock cards and eventually other decks, but you will start with one so be really carefull. Maybe you can read the basic strategy of all starting deck and choose the one that fits you.  All in all, I think that this is the best implementation of Magic the gathering for a casual player like I am. The game is packed with fun and it's not so hard to beat. It has a sense of progression and strategy building all for few bucks. If you are a more serious player maybe you can try Magic online. I'm sure Wizards of the Coast will welcome you there.  See ya.",

            "review_text": "I've commented on this game before, but it was the same as everyone else's critcism. So here's something different:  This is a good game for those who have never played DotP before. You have a limited assortment of cards you can choose from, it helps you with building your own deck, and the card repetoire isn't filled with convoluted spells that might confuse beginners.   They've since improved the 'pay to win' premium packs and allowed players to win them in Multiplayer games. I think this was a wise decision, because it will fill the online servers with more players than it would've had before.   The biggest critcism about the older DotP is you're stuck with the select decks given to you. You don't have much freedom with how the decks are built. The thing is, you're actually given a lot of choice with what you play: Want to play with Zombies? Here's a deck with 30 unlockable cards. How about Slivers? Cool, here you go. You are limited in what you can play in the decks, but if you're building a casual elven deck, are you going to play Llanowar Elves/Elvish Mystic? You probably are, so the game includes cards like that.  They didn't allow you to play a 'powerful White/Green' deck because they wanted each deck to have a theme.   The problem this specific game faces is that it doesn't have any specific themes in the card repetoire given to you. You can try to make a mill deck, but there aren't enough good mill cards. A mono-red burn deck isn't viable because there are only one or two solid burn spells. Reanimation isn't worth it.   You need to always play a well-balanced deck with a good amount of creatures complimented with some removal spells. That's the best deck you can make.   While this game helps beginners build decks and understand what's a strong spell or not, experienced players will not enjoy the changes from 2014. There are far too many issues with the game itself to enjoy it.",

Very hard to build a deck unless you are willing to buy online cards with real money, which you could be spending on actual MTG cards that are actually worth something. AI decks are also very lucky and seem to always get the right cards and perfect mana. I specifically hate the final boss, Garruk, whom you fight twice in a row (after he switches deck 1/2 way through). The second deck is just stupidly good and has some of the best removal, creatures and ramp i have ever seen. Every time i try to beat it, it removes everything right before it has a chance to combo off or he board wipes everthing on your side turn 6 because he can. Fun and good if you cen get it on the cheap, but please don't throw money at it, buy the real cards, much better investment.",

Whoever designed the UI should not be shot, its perfectly fine, and death is not required for the designer. Second, online gameplay is not dead, friends can do private matches, and whenever I have searched a match in quickplay, i find it almost instantly. Thirdly, yes, this game is slightly I-Pad oriented in the deckbuilding system, thing is, if you figure out a fast way to move throught it you can make a fresh deck within about 2 minutes. Fourth, then rethink your choices from now on. The game is not broken in any way, unless you ignore the system requirements (in which case you deserve to crash) then there should be not lag or glitches. anyways, im not going to continue with this since most other comments seem to just be repetitions of previously said things and death threats to the developer.",
