And you can't even win the game, it's difficult af. Oh and btw the minigame uses mouse but the others don't, have fun wasting your time.",

Since i'm not a pixel gamer i liked and find this game very cute, enjoyable and laughable. Have simple challeging, control, colours and moves. The sound is super perfect and addictive. This game maybe or might require use with a controller but I was satisfied using keyboard(I am used to it) without no problem. The price fits perfectly and i would recommend this game to anyone.",
