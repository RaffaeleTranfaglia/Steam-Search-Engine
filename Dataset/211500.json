WHAT A SOUND!!! TOTAL IMMERSION There are so many good things under the hood about this game that I seriously hope it'll become more appealing and known to all the simracers out there. Despite the unclear, sometime shady and mind-boggling business model S3 has adopted, this game deserve and deserve a lot! Don't be intimidated by the cost of contents in the store. You don't have to buy EVERYTHING (even if the temptation is high!). Set for yourself a budget, buy what you're really interested into and possibly wait for big discounts... they'll surely come.

I was looking for an alternative to GTR2 and RRE is slowly but surely turning into that (same devs after all). No 'rewinds', no bumping into other cars without severe consequences (spin), no drifting through corners at 250 kph... Perfect! Love it!  IT IS NO 'Need for speed' or 'Grid2' ('Grid Autosport' was an arcady desaster as well imho). IT IS NOT A GAMEPAD-CASUAL-RACER.  The DTM Experience is great if you are a fan of the DTM Series but as mentioned above feels a little unfinished (no weather change, car setups can't be saved,...). With the last patch there is a multiplayer (Alpha) in both DTM and RRE and tons of other improvements. I can't understand these negative reviews because the best about the game: It's free to try out. I can download and play parts of it without paying anything. And if you love it as much as I do you can buy the stuff you like and want... This game will be the next GTR2 once it's finished. I am really looking forward to each update... Pit stops are announced for the near future!",

            "review_text": "In short: RaceRoom Racing experience is a great racing simulator to those looking for cut-throat competitive AI in offline racing. The multiplayer is shaping up to be great, but in its current Alpha state it's not quite there yet. If you're on the fence, try the free content first and if you're looking to spend a few bucks, consider either DTM '92, ADAC GT Masters 2013 or 14, or the WTCC '13 pack. Money well spent. Look below the review for a comprehensive list of Pro's and Con's after the verdict.   Visually  R3E is a competitive title, on par with Assetto Corsa. Track textures and detail are what you expect them to be in a 2014 racing sim. Everything looks quite sharp and well detailed. Car interiors are nicely modelled as well, leaving only very few wishes to be desired. A few upcoming titles might look a bit better, but we'll see to those as they get released.  Ligthing, color and saturation in R3E seem very life-like and real. Lighting conditions can be selected from one of 5 presets: Sunrise, Morning, Noon, Evening and Sunset, with full real-time transitions coming later down the road.  In the  Sound  department, R3E really starts to shine. Or roar. Compared to other simulation titles like Assetto Corsa, Game Stock Car Extreme and rFactor2, the cars and engines in R3E sound like they have the punch they claim to have. The sound has just the right amount of reverb to immerse you and make you think you are sitting in fact inside of the car you are pretending to be driving at your PC.  On the  driving  side of thins, there is a lot of good to report as well: The physics feel similiar to other hardcore racing sims like rF2 or GSCE. It becomes immediately apparent whenever you push the car too hard, resulting in oversteer and overshooting a corner or massive oversteer and spinning out - or if you are lucky - just a major slide of the ideal racing line.  The game does communicate what is going on under your car really well through the  Force Feedback . With a little practice you can judge pretty well just by feel if you are about to lose the rear of the car, or whether your rear tyres have just locked up. This is really important in a racing sim, and in this regard R3E is comparable to Assetto Corsa and Game StockCar Extreme, but still a little off from rFactor2. To be fair, the FFB in rF2 is unmatched by any other sim.  If you're not up for racing against other people over the internet, R3E's AI will give you a good challenge. They can be either set to a fixed difficulty level (from 80 to 120%) or alternatively to Adaptive AI, which will ramp up or soften the difficulty depending on how well you do against the AI. In general, Adaptive AI is pretty good at giving you just the right challenge. You have to work really hard for a Victory, but at the same time the AI don't leave you in the dust and you always have some other cars to race against. In their general behaviour the AI race hard against you, but fair. They don't bump you out of the way, but they will use gaps to overtake. They will defend their position with defensive lines and not just stick to a single racing line. (I'm looking at you there, Gran Turismo.) In comparision to Assetto Corsa, the AI in R3E is more aggressive, but still fair.  Unfortunately the game is missing an AI agression control, like rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme have. I'd like to tweak the AI not just in skill, but also in agression.  Now, some time for  Multiplayer!  There are no dedicated servers available yet, so you have to hope that your favorite track/car combination is currently running on a server hosted by Sector3 studios. The servers are 'jump in and drive', meaning that if you don't pay attention you might end on a server that has just finished Qualifying and you start a race from the back of the grid. Netcode in Multiplayer is really solid. No cars warping around, no â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t contacts and bumps between cars that are 2 meters apart on screen. The community is okay, you get the occasional idiot who wrecks half the field and other people rage quit whenever they lose too many positions for their tastes, but additional features like ranking systems and wrecker bans are on the horizon for the Multiplayer, as well as Dedicated Servers for everyone.  Now for the most controversial part about this simulator:  The Store &amp; The Pricing : Out of the box you have access to two circuit tracks, a hillclimb track and a bunch of cars from different classes. In my opinion that's decent content for a free portion of a game. Some people might disagree, but everyone is entitled to their opinion I guess.  Tracks and Cars can be bought with  Virtual Race Points  or  vRP , and after the latest update with hard earned cash directly. This alleviates my previous criticism about having to essentially give Sector3 free money in exchange for virtual currency. Prices are not that cheap, but they are reasonable. A new car or track will generally set you back 2â¬ to 4â¬. You can get bigger discounts if you buy more stuff in bulk, or if you get stuff in packs: The DTM '92 pack with it's 5 cars and a ton of liveries is ~10â¬ compared to ~18â¬ when you buy them all individually. Additional discounts are granted to everyone who owns cars and tracks of a new pack: For example, I get a huge discount on ADAC GT Masters 2014 pack, because I already own most of the tracks and cars in R3E already. I think that's a fair system.  There is an option to  Test Drive  all the cars on the RaceRoom Raceway that is included in the game. You can also take part in the free competitions that are changing regularly. Those competitions feature a rotating set of cars and tracks. You don't have to own them to drive them, and if you're fast you might even win a prize!  Recommendations for your first purchase(s):  * DTM '92 pack (5 cars with a lot of liveries) * DTM Experience 2013 (3 cars, ton of liveries, 9 tracks) * WTCC 2013 pack (5 cars, ton of liveries, 3 tracks) * ADAC GT Masters 2013 (7 cars, ton of liveries, 6 tracks)   Verdict : If you have tried this sim half a year ago, please do come back and try it again! The driving physics and Force Feedback have been vastly improved, along with the new and fairer store pricing &amp; discount system. R3E drives just as well as Assetto Corsa, rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme. It has the best single player AI on the market, apart from GSCE and the largest selection of content (sans Modding) of the currently availlable sims.   Pro's  * Good Graphics * Great sounds * Very competitive AI * Good driving physics and FFB   Con's  * Multiplayer a bit bare-bones at the moment * Game can get expensive if you want to have everything",

            "review_text": "At the moment, racesim fans like me seems to live in a golden Age of Racing-Sims as there are a a few promising Sims are out on the market. To put a name to these Sims we've got Project CARS, Assetto Corsa and this game here - RaceRoom Racing Experience (short name R3E). As I was a member of the WMD-Kickstarter-Project for Project CARS I have played it a lot and followed the development-Progress from nearly beginning since its release. I was always impressed by its visual presentation and the dynamic Wether and time-progress...  Then there was Assetto Corsa... they started to release an early access-Version and I can't hold to get into it... In the beginning i was a bit disappointed because of the strange behavior of the Force-Feedback. After I tweaked it a bit I had some Fun with it but I don't become the feeling that I always want to play it. And now coming to RaceRoom Racing Experience... I started playing R3E in the beginning of the open beta-Phase. It was fun in the beginning but only good for hotlapping as other features were in development. After a while Sector 3 opens more and more features and deliver more and more content. So we've got Famous racing Series like ADAC GT-Masters, WTCC, the modern DTM and even the most famous classic DTM from the Year 1992. And that's the point where I got hooked in the Game. Despite the other Games, in R3E i've got the feeling to compete in a Racing-Series known in real live. In the other games the Races feel like a loose mixture of cars out of the game... Together with that R3E offers me the best Force-Feedback and the best Roadfeel of all... Not to forget - the Sound of the Racecars. There isn't any other Racesim out on the market the comes even close to the Sound in R3E. Multiplayer-Races are very great fun with close door to door fights. In the visual aspect - yes it is not that high polished like Project CARS and it has no dynamic weather at the moment, but it is very detailed. Especially the Tracks are very close to the real thing and modeled with a high affinity. There are no unnecessary Trackside-Objects that aren't there at the real track what gave me a more realistic feeling. One of the most important parts of a racesim is the Physics-Model... At that Point R3E at the same level as Assetto Corsa. Together with the better Roadfeel in R3E this game is the winner for me. Project CARS falls back in that point - fun to drive in Project CARS but not more... One negative aspect of R3E is the Business-Model of it. It is called Free-to-Play, what it really is, but only with reduced Content. In F2P you have 5 Free cars and 3 Tracks with 11 Layouts. With this content you can do what ever you want - Multiplayer-Races. Single-Player-Championships, Hotlapping and so on. Together with that, there are always a few Competitions online, in which you are able to drive with Cars and on Tracks you haven't bought before.  If you want to buy something, it can get expensive. But there are a few Tricks to get it in an acceptable range. So you can buy a Redeem-Code for the ingame-currency 'vRP' directly from Raceroom which offer a discount from 10% to 35%. Than you can buy Packs in the store which contains content-objects for a discounted price. The Track-Packs are perfect for that. But you don't have to buy a Car-Pack if you just like one car out of it. Than you can buy that single car and that allows you to drive in Competition or Multiplayer-Races in that Class and other things like that. If you are not sure what to buy, you can always ask at the Sector3-Forum. You will definitely get an answer out of the community - or even from one of the developers. That's another great plus for me, that the Developers are in close contact to the Community and take part in discussions in the Forum.  In Conclusion I just can say, that R3E maybe isn't the best in every aspect (graphics, busness-model), but overall for me it is the best RacingSim out on the market which hooked me and entertained me a long time now. As it is still in development it will even get better. ",

            "review_text": "This game has been receiving loads of updates recently and the more i play it the more i want to. Plenty tracks and cars to choose from to get you going for free.   The game is very brutal to you for your mistakes. Using Apex Hunt for practise will get you understanding the car and track. Hitting corners within cars capability feels sweet with regard to how you have car balanced in relation to amount of speed, braking or acceleration; depending on the line you take. You have to set the car up for each corner to hit that sweet spot of being in control or not.  Brake too hard for a corner and you will lock up and drift wide until you regain grip, brake to late and carry to much speed into corner you are greatly penalised for your misjudgement.   There are loads of Challenges, Competitions and other race modes.  Still finding new features each time I take time to navigate through all the in game options one of which that caught my eye was the ability to capture video and take screenshots from the automatically saved replays from your best lap time for each car and track combination.  7.5/10   Edit 24/11/2016  This games's physics, look and feel with evreything else about this game has just hugely changed for the better.

Now the game is my favorite racing simulation (play it more than Assetto Corsa and Project Cars right now). I'm so glad I gave it a second chance.  Heard about the massive update in November so I reinstalled the game and ran a few races and I was hooked. The physics model is very much improved since 2013. Combine this with remarkably better FFB and it's basically a new game. I took advantage of the Black Friday deal and now have all the cars and tracks. Love running the ADAC GT, DTM, Audi Sport TT, and WTCC cars. Tracks are nicely modeled and have excellent nuances including bumps and curbs. I especially like how well they model the loss of grip when you crest a hill. You can really feel the wheels lift and the car lose grip.   The AI is very good. Just run a few races and allow the adaptive AI to adjust to your skill and you'll be impressed. I really appreciate how imperfect the AI can be, making realistic mistakes and getting into trouble yet not careless and running you off the road. Significantly better than the AI in Assetto Corsa or Project Cars. AI in those games feels like robots hotlapping in a perfect line. Especially Assetto Corsa - very boring AI.   Surprised to hear about so many technical issues in other reviews. Game runs beautifully for me. Graphics are gorgeous and fps are fast and smooth. I'm running an i7-6700k &amp; Geforce 980 Ti so most games fly. This game seems well optimized given the 30-40 AI cars with no stutter.   Overall this game has come a LOOOOONG way in almost 4 years. I went from being a harsh critic to huge fan. Says a lot about Sector3 Studio's commitment to making this game great.",

So I did wait until Dec 2015 to try it out after all the patches and changes that seemed to make it worth buying. I race in iRacing, PCars, Assetto Corsa, FM, FH, and now RaceRoom. The graphics inside the cockpit and looking out to the opponents is probably the best among these sims providing you have a decent PC and can max out the graphics. I give it a 9.5/10 for graphics. The physics are also very good since you can adjust many settings in the FFB. So if you make a few adjustments, then I would easily say 9/10 on phyiscs. And with all the adjustments you get for the feel, then nearly a perfect. The gameplay is focused on DTM and GT3 in my opinion and that is pretty much why I bought it. No other sims have anything really in the DTM class although I am hoping PCars gets into DTM more. So if you like DTM, I can tell you this is the best sim for DTM. I haven't had any issues at all and have to say the negative onslaught this game gets is just not accurate. But there seems to be a few issues. Like with the fuel and tire wear set to real, they don't seem to ever go down. It's 100% all the time so I think that is a bug. And the AI is annoying until you learn how to avoid them. But this is one of the best sims out there in my opinion, especially DTM and GT3. I just don't understand how people can spend 15 min on a game and slam the heck out of it. Their connectivity issues and setup is more than likely their own setup problem. Yes, it needs a little help with car setups too like adding tire pressure...lol But the game feels and looks excellent, It's worth the money for DTM for sure.  Update: 4/30/2016 - RaceRoom is Awesome! I've waited a month after the 3/31/2016 update that massively improved the GT3 and Prototype physics. The new physics and new FFB settings, new car setup, especially for GT3, ADAC GT Masters, DTM, and the new Audi P1 along with Nordschleife puts this sim to the stellar level in my opinion. In addition, the fuel and tire wear now works finally. Neverthelesss, the new FFB meter to check for clipping is very nice. I am very critical of physics and so you know where I am coming from, Assetto Corsa and iRacing have the top slot with PCars a close second. Race Room was just behind PCars. Unfortunately, Forza just doesn't have the physics at these levels, e.g. you cannot feel the rubber on the road and utilze braking to control the cornering accurately in Forza Motorsport at least yet. So Forza is last in the physics ranking among all these. But I am now putting RaceRoom up there at the Assetto Corsa and iRacing level. I am at the point of saying the physics in Race Room, at least for the DTM, ADAC, GT3 and Prototype classes, is possibly even better than Assetto Corsa and iRacing. The sound in Race Room is also stellar if not the best among the aformentioned sims and I am not even using 7.1 yet just stereo. Race Room does not get the recognition it deserves....another point is I am astonished it's onlyh using DX9c where all the others I've mentioned are on DX11 or even DX12. So it blows me away they are getting this level of crisp graphics viewing the opponents cars and interior that they do....congrats Race Room for pulling that off.",

I agree some of the content is too pricey, but for a reasonable price you can grab two or three packs of cars/tracks and have a ton of fun.  The opponent AI and the sound are the best currently available. Handling/physics is great, maybe just a notch behind AC, and the polish of the UI and menus is simple but well done and doesn't feel like a beta like so many sims do these days. No better game out right now if you want to simulate a touring car race season.  If you're a sim racing fan, you should absolutely give this a try and see if you want to buy some additional content.

The graphics are really nice, the gameplay is simple but and it is a big but. The menu system they've tried to do is a little complicated.. Also being a free member ONLY, you get only... 4 cars max and only 3 tracks man. In order to get the other cars, which you can see from the video above you must pay real money for, there is no mutlplayer to date, it is greyed out for now. So they should be releasing it. No multyplayer yet leaves singleplayer only, during there... You are the only racer, you get a ghost car but only 1, no other cars. Boring! The cars you get I think is 4 max but I only noticed 2, the super car you get and a BMW.. Now the handling... It does not matter what mode you select from the 2, amatuer or sim they both drive exactly the same, I tried them both out and both of them handled the exact same no difference to it, you can edit the car setup which is alright but the cars STILL feel the same. I tried to get along with this game, but the massive downfall of you having to buy the other cars and extremely limiting gameplay is a massive no no. I maybe redownload this game in the future for a little mess around with friends, WHEN they release the multiplayer but for now, it is just not ready.",

Force Feedback: TOO MANY CONTROLLS on wheel settings plus these settings get changed for every car, So you have to go through the process all over again (most likely) if you change cars. The default steering was WAY to sensitive so I decreased and then the car felt sluggish and it felt like controller lag.   I never felt like I was racing :-( I also found it impossible to drift due to the problems described with the wheel response and force feedback settings. Maye it's the wheel as I see other people mention the Logitech setups are an issue. I just don't want to spend hrs setting up a wheel for each car I want to use.  The grass / track edges seem suck you in. Is that considered realism?

Unfortunately the game has serious lacks like tire choice, temperature, setups saving, ...  So i don't know if i recommend or not. As a realism-addict-gamer i would say YES YES YES : the sensations you get when you manage to drive a fast car in this simulator are just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ic. As a customer i would say NO : i'm seriously disappointed about many obvious lacks in the simulation, keeping in mind the money you need to spend to own decent car and tracks choices to practice and challenge.   But i could say same thing about our IRL cars: webcams, USB, SDcard etc are cheap and already old stuff from around 2000... so why aren't they supplied by default on every car in the market by then ?  Why do we still have to pay hundreds of euros to get that options on a 10-20.000 euros product ?   By the way you can drive some car and tracks FOR FREE INFINITELY !!  So no surprise if you buy it.

You get what you pay for and the quality here outshines any misgivings regarding prices.  Graphically it's stunning especially with everything turned high and running at 60fps with 22 cars on the track, for which I'm referring to DTM experience, but the hot lapping in the base game with Ai turned on gives you an insight into what the finished game will feel like and in my opinion they have got it spot on.  I can only assume that the base game is yet to be optimised because I get lower FPS on the same tracks, with only a couple of cars out than I do with the 22 cars in a full race of DTM. Same graphics settings for both but with a 10 fps drop in the base game? Sounds are incredible, I've never been so engrossed in the sounds of any game as this one and playing with headphones on just highlights the beauty of these cars. Gameplay is great especially on the Get Real setting, althought the Ai needs a little bit more speed as its currently too easy to catch and overtake. I'm currently using a Razer Sabertooth gamepad and once setup it works perfectly but I can only imagine how much more fun a steering wheel would make this and it's the game which will likely push me to make that commitment.  It's that good that I've bought pretty much most of the buyable stuff, except for a couple of livery options, within just a few days of trying it.  EDIT : May 26th 2016  After having set myself up with some decent hardware to get the most out of driving games I can say that this is my favourite driving experience on the PC. I own most if not all of the PC racing sims but there's something about Raceroom that makes it very special to me, and that's the feeling you get from the overall atmosphere that this sim creates. From the sounds to graphics to driving feel, once set up correctly this is such a cool experience with AI that can keep up and give you a thrilling racing experience.",

I'm going to dive into some subjects a lot of negative reviews talk about and try and explain my viewpoint on them.    Multiplayer    The multiplayer is currently still developping. There are dedicated servers, and you can create your own lobbies. Multiplayer at the moment isn't very crowded, however you can have some good and fun races.    Payment model    Contrary to the Free to Play tag this game isn't free to play. A better tag would be Free Demo, but it seems this can't be helped. I'm going to compare the game with league of legends, because it's a well known free to play game. In league of legends you earn in game currency for playing, and that currency can be used to buy things. Next to the ingame currency there is a currency buyable with irl money. In RaceRoom, there is no ingame currency, just vRP, which can be bought for irl money. That's also why I don't think the Free to Play tag applies.  Now on to the paymeny model. Paying 50â¬ upfront for a game and unlocking all the content is very nice, but there will most likely be content you don't like or feel like playing. In RaceRoom, tracks, cars, trackpacks and carpacks can be bought seperately. Say you don't like DTM, but do like GT2, then you can just buy the GT2 cars. One thing to note is that if you want all the items, you'll be looking at a price quite a bit higher than 50â¬. But to put his into perspective, in league of legends you pay +- 10â¬ for a champion, in RaceRoom you pay +- 2.5 euro for a car.  I should also note that content can be tested for free, so you have an idea whether or not you like it.    Interface    The interface has been upadtes, is new easy to navigate and comprehend, but you still need a mouse to be able to quickly navigate menu's    Some personal insight   I do believe you need a wheel to play this game. You can you a gamepad, but then you're just not getting the complete experience.   The sounds in the game are incredible, especially with the new transmission sound update.  Graphics are great and the game runs on older hardware however there is only Dx9 support if I'm not mistaken.   As an ending I'd say, try the game out, test drive some cars, and if you like it buy some cars you enjoy driving. ",

So. Nice game, but needs plenty of development and as is, it's overpriced.",

This game has come a long way since 2009. Thats right, 2009. its been reworked alot of times, and its always getting better.   This is one of the most fair free to play models in the market. Each track takes hundreds of hours of work. Some of the newer tracks have the cost of laser scanning on top of the time to write it.   Nearly every game out today sells dlc. This base game is free. You $40 to $60 ahead just for trying it. If you like it, then get what you like. If not, at least you did not blow $40 to $60 for a game you only play once in a while.     The cars that come with the game are good enough to get a feel for the game, but if you like the game your gonna need to buy the tracks and cars you want. There are packs available to save you some money. You will probably spend $60 to $80 for the content you want if you like the game. All the content is about $250 or so.  I used this on my Fanatec Wheel, and my x360 controller, both play well.  At this current time most of what this game has to offer surpasses every other sim I have played including A/C. When A/C first came out, it had this beat. Now with a few updates later, it is better both graphically and in terms of physics.  I only wish the game had Daytona Road Course.  I have been a supporter of this game long before it was ported to steam. About 2009 or so. This game really does continue to get developed.",

This is the short version of the review: Pros  +The sounds are superb +The graphics are nice +The car handling is very good  +The tracklist is seems very cool +The carlist is very good (Only racecars, mind you) +The menus are easy to use +The in-game interface is easy to understand +Extremely detailed tuning +The AI is good  Cons -Very limited in cars and tracks if you do not pay for them -You need a gamepad or steering wheel to enjoy the game -Tyres seem to last unrealisticly long (Might just be me, I am not experienced in real racing) -Damage can only be enabled on the hardest difficulty (For explanation, see below) -The pit menu is a bit fiddly  This is the longer version of the review: RaceRoom is a very good simulator racing game. This is how it works: There are three difficulty settings. Novice, Amateur and GetReal. Novice is the easiest. It has Traction Control, Anti-Lock Brakes and Auto Braking. Amateur is the middle ground. It only has TC and ABS. GetReal surely does what is says. It gets real. No assists enabled. GetReal is only usable for those with a gamepad or a steering wheel. On a keyboard is utterly useless. There is a damage model, but it can only be used in the 'GetReal' mode, which seems odd to me. In the 'GetReal' mode, you can choose if you want mechanical damage, only cosmetic or none at all. The game also includes a penalty system for corner cutting. You can set it to different kinds of penalties. A slow down penalty, a drive-through penalty or a stop-and-go penalty (Be aware, you'll have to select to serve it manually. Just driving through the pits to serve a drive-through won't work). When you don't pay any money you get acces to three tracks and seven or eight (could be wrong, might be less) cars. Two circuits and one hillclimb course. You can test drive any car you like as many times as you like, but only on a specific track. For the test drive, you can select the difficulty mode. You cannot test drive the tracks, which I think is odd. The game sounds fantastic and looks very good as well.  The tuning in the game is unbelievably detailed and quite frankly scarily detailed. I daren't touch it.   Overall, I think it is a great simulator which everyone interested in racing should give a try.

Raceroom itself is still in beta and therefore it doesn't have much other than doing practice sessions with AI. I took advantage of a sale recently and got all RaceRoom content for about $70. That's a few dozen cars and 15-20 tracks I think. That's a great price especially compared to another race sim that I've spent about $1,000 on (iRacing). RaceRoom is a lot of fun.   DTM is a little lacking in content (no pit stops, no rain, no mp) but some of that should come later. At least I know the multiplayer will. Even though it's lacking in content it is one very, very good racing simulation. I highly recommend it.",

I did enjoy this game once i realised that it is DEMO but i would very much appritiate if i was told that it is DEMO prior to playing it, the initiall shock was bad.    Game looks and feels great, what little of it i did play allways seemed to be good and difficulity of it was (inspite of my lack of skill) allso fairly aceptable. I did not encounter anny game breaking bugs and my constant out of track ventures were due to lack of skill. So they did pretty god job on that front and i praise that.  Trying to play championship with 2 tracks is stupid tho so i am not inclied to dignify this point too much: content is excellent for DEMO, pathetic for annything but demo.  Car selection is not too sad tho you only have access to 2 overarching categories (prototype and can cars) couple of choicess within each one, fairly solid content for this demo.  I did have major problem orienting myselve in menu, the track, car icons are way too large, list that would expand once you click the specific icon would be better. Furthermore structure of the menu itselve is kinda wonky - it'd be great if you could select category (prototype, can, formula, etc) than went to brand or year selection and than chose liviery. Right now you choose year AND category on one screen (WTCC 2013 example) and than individuall vehicle. it is not very intuitive is what i am aluring to.

            "review_text": "------------------------ Updated Review February 25, 2015 ------------------------ Well, I decided to spend a little more time on RaceRoom Racing Experience, and admittedly, it is a lot better than when I tried it last year. I've been able to complete single player AI racing on two tracks, and I can practice on three tracks. The selection of cars is a little better for being free, but still not enough to really keep you entertained.  I didn't try the online portion of this, partially because I'm pretty bad at this game (I'm more used to Forza and GT) and partially because most people playing online are using DLC that you need to purchase.  This game definitely has great physics, and I'll probably give it another shot using my G27 instead of my Xbox 360 controller. Unfortunately, I still can't recommend it. You can pay for a full game like pCARS or Assetto Corsa and receive a lot more content than RaceRoom can deliver in its DLC packs (from what I'm reading).  ------------------------ Old Review May 26, 2014 ------------------------ During the small amount of time I've had playing this, I honestly don't think this is a free-to-play game. Admittedly, this game feels and plays more like a demo than F2P.  Only being able to play hot-lap modes, with one track (a few variants of that one track, but still one location), and very few cars makes this game feel like a joke when advertised as free-to-play.  While the gameplay is decent enough, I feel that the control of the cars could be a little better. Using a G27, I feel as if I can't seem to turn sharp enough to get through some corners unless I slow down to rediculously slow speeds, and that's only using 200 degrees of the wheel. As a comparison, on Assetto Corsa I can pull decent turns during the curves, and that's using the full 900 degrees of the wheel.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend this. For your simulation fix, I think you'd be better off currently purchasing Assetto Corsa.",

The rest of the cars and tracks (you get a handful for free) cost approx $3/$5 respecitvely. Mind you it is just 1 Model of Car, not variations, like all BMW's M Class. Now the tracks probably are reasonable, but I have not bought 1 to see just how close to the real thing they are. If they are like the included tracks that you get for free, I might be able to see buying a track. Right now you can probably with the Easter Sale pick up 4-5 cars for around $6, tracks maybe 2 for the same $6.   Note, if you have money in your Steam Wallet, you can convert them to the currency used to buy the tracks and cars.  So I would wait and see if they do any really special promotion with multiple cars for a low price. The DTM package, has 3 cars, with multiple paint schemes/team versions, but I don't know if that is really worthwhile. They do include several tracks in the package. So for right now, with the game still, sort, in a beta to release candidate status, depends on who you talk to and what you consider aa final release. But you can clearly see they state 'Open Beta' as of April 10, 2014.",
