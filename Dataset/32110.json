A good number of the sound effects are highly annoying to the point where you will just end up muting the game which is actually lucky for you since the music isn't all that great either. Sound aside this game basically is just a rush to find and match 2 'special' tiles and nothing more since the game just auto-completes the rest of your matches when you do. I don't know about you but I kinda dislike having the game played for me like that. Do yourself a favor and play the free Mahjon Titans or whatever you have on your windows comp by default.  Editing this in because I forgot something else that was rather annoying... the tiles lack a proper sense of depth so it's a pain to tell tiles that are or are not covered in some way. In a lot of cases stuff that looks like it's free isn't and other that look like they can't be used are actually accessible.",
