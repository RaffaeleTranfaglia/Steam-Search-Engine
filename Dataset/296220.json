            "review_text": "I played the first few on the tablet, but this is a poorly translated mess. Or it gives the impression it's been poorly translated because of its terrible grammar and nonsensical dialogue. I'd hate to think who wrote the text actually spoke English.  The game itself is mostly functional, but there are similar games out there with better production value. If you liked the ones that came before it, and don't bother reading anything, you might enjoy it, as it adds a couple of new mechanics in, but I was left feeling pretty disappointed.",

Farm Frenzy 4 is very diffrent in so many aspects, making the game at the same time easier and harder. I'd say, check it out.",

It can be repetive, after the first missions it can get pretty hard (I like it casual). The graphics are kinda silly.",
