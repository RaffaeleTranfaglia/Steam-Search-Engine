            "review_text": "  &lt; Disclaimer!! I got this game for free for reviewing purposes &gt;    Before I start with this review, Let me just say this. This is a fun colorful game that I recommend for the RPG, Turn-based type fans out there, Otherwise you might not like it very much, Because the game's focus is pretty much on that.  So to begin. Mighty Dungeons is a really fun game, It is very customize-able so gives you more choices to go with your adventure.  As you can see in the screenshots, Your character and enemies are icons moving across the map, Which is not really a bad thing it gives the game a more (strategic) feeling. The game is fast, You don't feel that (Come on just move already) part, Because everything goes by fast.  I am not a fan of phone ports (Ios/android) But this one was built again for pc to suit it better, And the devs are doing a great job with it so far.  A feature I like about the game, All those customizing features in it, When creating a new character you choose the game difficulty, Character buffs ( making it stronger ) Enemy buffs ( making them also stronger). You also choose if the fights are turn-based or with a 5 second timer, Also while making a new character you can choose if Perma-Death is enabled or disabled for it, For a stronger challenge to some.  With more than 10 characters to choose from, All can equip certain types of Weapons, Armor, Spells, And more. And they all look very good in design gotta hand it to them.  About 7 Campaigns, Each having 8 levels becomes harder as you progress through, And also a great feature which is workshop, So you can create more Quests, Campaigns, Characters, Weapons, And steam community is very creative, Hoping to see some good stuff.  I like the old-school Rpg style in battles, Nothing too complicated just the basic Rpg type.  The map design is splendid, Gives you a path to follow and to reach the destination, And with every quest and campaigns it gets bigger and better with new designs and layouts, Chests and Cabinet and more to loot, Monsters everywhere, Traps to disarm and Secret paths to find. The quests are easy, Find the thing, Rescue this guy, Kill the Dungeon master and a lot more.  A shop to buy all sort of stuff from, A tavern to reach after finishing a quest, A training area to test your power, And after every quest and achievement you get points to spend to upgrade your hero. Oh yeah also Achievements, There's a huge pack of them in this game.  What I disliked so far is the game's balance, I feel like certain characters are overpowered ( Fire demon ) On nightmare mode, Your hp becomes much lower but damage gets higher, So becomes easy to 1 hit monsters before they get the chance to attack you. So I don't suggest going Nightmare mode, I highly recommend going with the original mode.  Lets go to the pros and cons.    Pros",

            "review_text": "For its price, it is a great beer and pretzel game that is fun and easy to play. One can play a dungeon quickly providing nice entertainment when tight for time. The graphics are pretty basic 2D graphics. Magic and most weapons have a limited number of uses, so you should check your inventory before entering a dungeon. All weapons, spells, potions, and armor is available at the start but it may take while before they are affordable.",

            "review_text": "Mighty Dungeons is a decent dungeon crawling phone game. You move an icon resembling your character around a 2D surface. You move one square at a time and find chests, monsters, and items you can use. When you fight a monster it pops up a static image of the enemy and you can click an attack button or a part of the monster's body.  You have a bunch of dungeons to play through with each one having 8 stages. Each one has different objectives to complete to finish the level. you can then spend money you found to buy new gear to improve opn your character. You will also earn xp points to upgrade certain stats when you complete feats like kill so many monsters, earn so much gold, etc.  The game was fun for a while but after I completed about 4 or 5 dungeons I grew tired of playing. It's a good time waster and can be some fun in small spurts.",
