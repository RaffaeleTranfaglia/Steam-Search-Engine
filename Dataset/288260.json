            "review_text": "A realtime strategy space battle game where, instead of directly ordering ships to move, you 'flick' them like rubber bands. The setting and art are very unique, but...  This game is a laundry list of 'it could have been good if...'   if they had ditched the gimmicky flicking and just made it a standard RTS  if it was turned based instead of real time so you could manage all the crap (it actually seems like it was meant to be turn based but was changed at the last second)  if you could actually issue orders while paused  if the controls weren't so choppy that you end up deselecting the unit half the time you go to 'flick'    The end result is just a mess of fiddling with the annoying flicking mechanic while your ships are shot up in real time with no real ability to pause because you can't pre-order flicks while paused. There are special abilites that differentiate the ships, but most of them also require flicks and aren't worth the hassle. Both building ships and using abilities take the same money resource, but you recover money so quickly that it's never a factor. The only limiting factor is the player's time and attention flicking ships one at a time. Special abilities aren't worth using because that's time you could have spent building more ships (which also requires a flick on the contructing ship) and flicking them towards the enemy.  This could have worked turn based. This could have worked without flicking. This could have worked with the ability to issue orders and flicks while paused. But none of those are true so the game just plain doesn't work. It's a shame because from an artistic standpoint it's great. The gameplay is just horrid though.",

            "review_text": "This game has a really great plot for a singleplayer - this is the material for some roleplaying game. Flicks mechanics are poor, true, but if one can endure those boring space battles with very low level AI then one can immerse itself into a pretty decent story with nice esthetics.  The following is from singleplayer point of view:  Pros: - style &amp; esthetics of cutscenes - really great! - plot is interesting, makes me want to play more - the setting is really original - map of the world is great  Cons: - err, the gameplay is really mediocre with this flicking mechanics - AI is so weak that beating stages is only a matter of time  As many people pointed out - this would have been a really good game if it was turn based.   To be totally honest - I was sucked in by the story and esthetics of cutscenes, but I've played this free access full version of the game. If I was to pay for this game I would have still enjoyed it but not that much.  Buy it if you want to immerse yourself in a great and original setting but beware - the setting and the story are actually more interesting than the game itself. Please read other reviews just to make a smart decision.",
