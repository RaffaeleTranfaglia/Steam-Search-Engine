            "review_text": "Playing only a bit of it, the game is somewhat addictive. The soundtrack is amazing for this game. It's more or less an endurance run, grab a shield to avoid hitting walls and bullets, but also avoid the holes on the floor that end the game. The longer you stay, the more points you have. Other than that, there isn't much more. Multipliers do help.   And I'm sure once this game builds a big enough audience, my name won't be on the high score board. (I'm kinda bad at video games)",

            "review_text": "Great game!  There is no story, and no real sophistication in the gameplay - nor is either necessary. You move a 'ship' around the screen, trying to avoid obstacles (usually blocks or pits, a few moving parts).  Around you is a neon lighted strobing light tunnel and the course itself is only a few meters visible, building itself as you race along.   What makes the game so interesting is the way the music meshes with the gameplay, the way you can, or rather must, lose yourself until there is nothing but the moving ship and the gradually appearing course. You don't have to  think  about what you do, you just have to  DO  it. If you start to plan ahead, you'll likely to crash into a block.  Minimal as the gameplay is, it has a soothing effect - you  have  to be calm to get good reactions, after all.  The controls react instantly, and there is no need to familiarize yourself with the way the game is handled. You might need a few tries to get a feeling for how the 'ship' reacts, but it doesn't seem to have any personality at all - you push the left key, it goes left. No delay, no sliding. Ideally it'll be as if it reacts to your thoughts.   My only regret is that the music restarts when you die in endless mode. Since I die often, it means I don't get to hear the rest of it.   I'm not entirely sure how much I think this game is worth. I bought it for 1.25 Euro, and I certainly don't regret spending that money. Would I have paid more? Might be. I don't know how much I'll end up playing it, but even if I didn't play it any more, I'd consider it money well spent.  Unfortunately there is no demo version available for the PC, which IMO would be a good idea, since you can only experience the game by playing it - viewing a video dosn't tell you halfway enough.",

            "review_text": "Warning: rage quit ahead!  Avoid - Sensory Overload is a simple game that is strangely addictive. Controlling a small racing hovercraft ship thingy, you fly into the screen on a series of obstacle-course-like tracks, which become faster and more evil as you progress.  The game has four level 'styles': Electronic, Minimal, Laserdance and Sythrock. As you may have guessed from the names, each of these level styles has its own musical style to go with it. Each is also unique in terms of graphical and obstacle style, too. For example, Electronic sees you speeding across bright, colourful stages to electronic music, dodging occasional glowing orbs, whereas Minimal levels have a march darker and minimalist theme (and are, I find, the most distracting, graphically speaking).  After choosing a level style you are then able to choose from defined levels or 'endless' mode, which sees you endlessly racing across a randomly generated track in your chosen style until you crash or fall off the track. If you choose the levels option, then you'll find that your chosen level style has four difficulty groups of eight individual levels each, ranging from Easy, through Medium, Hard and Extreme. These are pre-defined tracks, each of which always plays the same, so beating the levels is a matter of skill and memory, especially as you progress through the harder stages.  Playing through the pre-defined levels, you are graded on how well you do collecting bonuses and not dying. Each track gives you two extra lives to begin with, so you can crash or fall off the track twice; on the third such event, you lose the level and must start again.  At this point I have completed all 32 Easy levels with full points (collecting all bonuses and not crashing or falling off the track) and all 32 Medium levels with varying degrees of success. I now find the difficulty is about at my limit: I've only completed two or three Hard levels, and only one of them with full points. I now usually find myself playing a level or two and rage quitting.  The controls are very simple -- just move left or right -- but they feel a bit slow. And when you're on the edges of the track, especially, it can be hard to gauge where your ship thingy is; I've crashed or fallen off the track numerous times when I thought I was correctly in position. I think a higher and further-back camera angle would have been a better choice for the game.  Graphics are simple, but do the job. Music is pretty good; I think I even recognised an instrumental version of a popular song or two in there, but I may have been mistaken.  So, do i recommend this game? Yes, if you can pick it up on sale or in a bundle for the right price. It should keep you entertained for a couple of hours, at least. ",

            "review_text": "Instant classic. If you enjoy those 'Avoid'-type of games where you are to steer left or right to get as far as possible without crashing then this game is for you.   It's not very deep, but there are many different play modes and each level is unique every time you play.   I really enjoy how within a second of dying you are playing again. Crash, hit 'A', back to avoiding again. Superb.  The leaderboards are the best part. Every time you get a little bit better of a high score, you can see your global rank positioning. All games should have this!",
