            "review_text": "Lasting about 3-5 hours, NaissanceE is a surreal exploration puzzle game that is appropriately atmospheric and moody, strange and surreal, sometimes puzzling and confusing, but most of the time something that feels like a trip into a strange, foreign, isolated world that runs by its own rules, rules that you have to figure out to progress and survive.  Only the most abstract of plots exists in the games; You start off the game running from some sort of shadow thing, and fall down to what can easily be compared to the rabbit hole. Your only given slight clues of a narrative, mostly coming from the chapters titles themselves, but the story is fairly simple... Lucy, our character, needs to go down deeper into this abyss and figure out what's down there. However, even without a strict narrative, the game manages to have a lot of personality and engagement. The loose narrative structure, surrealism, strange tripping moments, slight yet odd puzzle solving, and the strange world run by its own rules, remind me a lot of something like Yume Nikki or LSD: Dream Emulator, while it's a very different sort of game than either of those it in many instances can give off a similar otherworldly feel, and like those games, a strange inner-joy to try and explore and learn what you can about this strange, foreign, yet somewhat familiar place,  One super minor complaint is that I thought it'd be interesting if the game had developed more of its mechanics further, the game has the tendency to introduce an interesting concept and keep that concept to but a single section of the game, and never mixes and matches concepts like it could. However, the sheer number of ideas on display, how they're handled and presented, and how many of them strike the mark and work, more than make up for it, and also helps in the element of always guessing what may be coming next.  Besides that, the only complaint I have comes from a few moments. What you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go is sometimes kind of obtuse, there's a few instances of trying to figure out what is the correct course of action to move forward that feels less puzzle solving and either trying to spot some obscure passage you missed or a guessing game with little hint, but again, minor in the grand scheme of things. There is one instance involving a wind tunnel and fans that I found to be a bit too trial and error, and sort of forced you to learn the breathing mechanic timing the character has while running to progress. There are some sequences the game turns more into a timed platformer, and these segments are notably weaker than the times the game moves at a slower pace, while I didn't find these segments bad, it is of note that they did strike less with me than most of the other sections of the game.  The game has several secrets to find, which were a joy to look for and uncover. Each of the chapters felt very different without breaking the flow of the game to what we learned before.  The flaws the game has are minor because the experience during its 3-5 hour run time is thoroughly gripping, strange, yet interesting, atmospheric, a sense of alone, sometimes dips into madness, and I'd even dare to say at times magical. It's a game that managed to capture a series of raw emotions of me whole playing with no dialogue or concrete story. It made me think deeply about things in the human psyche as I questioned my interpretations of things by mere suggestion, it can sometimes be mind-bending in the best possible way, and despite its short length, managed to be gripping from beginning to end. I'd say completely worth it for those who want to take a trip into a strange, interesting world.",

Matter is space, light is time and you are the only sentient being in existence. As you slowly unravel the dream, you pass through phases of ease and unease, and in your psychedelia and hallucinations spawned by a broken brain, you dream up senseless rules, quests and objectives, in order to turn the tides of terror and bliss and slowly progress through your illness.  If you like psychelic experiences, this game is for you. The above contains no spoilers, but is simply the best way I could describe the game. I played through Naissancee in more or less one sitting (about 5 hours), and I'd argue this is the way the game is meant to be played, as it gives that feeling of going ever and ever deeper into the rabbit hole.  tl;dr: totes worth â‚¬15 Note that while the game is generally easy on the eyes, it has a couple of sequences (5-10 minutes in total at most) that will break any person with epilepsy. This is no joke, I had to cover my eyes because I was getting dizzy.",

            "review_text": "Poorly placed checkpoints and an infuriating wind mechanic combine with mundane platforming to turn an incredibly atmospheric and visually pleasing game into a poor experience.  When the tag line for a game emphasizes the look, experience, and exploration mechanics you would not expect platforming sections to be a main focus. The first real platforming sequence is alright, you interact with a unique aspect of the environment and rely on very basic timing to make it to your destination. The second real platforming section though... it just looks so unlike the rest of the game. The fan blades, axels, and gear boxes seem out of place when compared to the environments that you have previously gone thorugh. Combine this with a wind mechanic that will pick you up and throw you to your death if you do not move fast enough and it becomes very apparent very quickly that you're expected to complete these sections at a sprint. Any slow down inveitably results in you being picked up by the fierce wind and thrown into the fan blades which immediately kill you.  I would not recommend this. I came here expecting to experience and explore a unique world made by the develoeprs of this game. I did not come here for a poorly implemented mirror's edge clone.",

I'm a sucker for artful use of minimalism and geometry in games, and this, couple with the most ambient lighting I've seen in a game, and its chilling sound design turn this game into a brooding adventure like no other.  The story, or lack thereof, is best experienced firsthand and left to interpretation, and that's the beauty of it.  If you like running around in big, empty spaces, in a narrative of zero words instead told through the level design, then this game was made for you, as it was for me.",

The actual gaming part of the game is not worth anything, it's actuallly downright bad in a lot of places. (The riding cubes down the wall part, the wind tunnels part, the final 'bossfight'. All awful stuff from a gamedesign perspective.) The breath mechanic ultimately doesn't add anything except annoyance. There is for the most part no direction or hints of where you're supposed to go, but for a game of this type that's perfectly fine, though it does leave you wondering if surviving a long fall means you broke the game and you're not supposed to be where you are, or if you actually found the right path.  It has some very nice visuals in places when it doesn't lose itself in abstract gobbeldygook and goes to the more realistic BLAME!-like environments. Unfortunately the amazing infinite city vibe only reveals itself in about half of the gametime, leaving the other half clambering around in tubes or cubespew corridors. The desert was really cool, but I'm not sure if I got to see all of it really. In most games light is there to help the player, but in this game is there to actively annoy you and make things irritating.   My advice: Play until you see the text ' Breath Compression ' appear on the screen, then exit and uninstall the game. You'll miss out on ' Interlude ' (which really is just 5 minutes of holding forward, but the leadup to the next chapter is great) and ' Endless Dive ', but you won't have to slog through the insipid bullcrap of the chapters surrounding them. Unfortunately the first part of the game is also awful, but it's worth slogging through if you've already got the game.  I can't really recommend this game, even if this is exactly the kind of game I enjoy. :-( This makes me sad!",

At first you explore simple yet confined level structures that very soon give way to absolutely monumental feeling set pieces that will have you in awe. The art style is in itself consistent and works very well, especially when paired with the rather excellent audio design. This visual and acoustic experience seems to always matche perfectly. The game really manages to deliver a wide range of experiences and emotions, from feeling lost in a huge and fascinating world to adrenaline pumping action sequences and solving the occasional puzzle, it does it all very well.  The one thing I especially enjoyed is the at times very clever level design. While being a linear game with areas for you to explore it never feels like it is linear. In fact, I could swear I was making my way through at random or at being driven by interesting set pieces.  Don't however expect much of a story. Not in the traditional sense anyways. Whatever happened or happens is up to your imagination. That is a good thing though.  All in all, if you're looking for a game that will take you on a bit of an emotional rollercoaster ride while making you feel small, forgotten and alone, then play it.  The thing that stayed most with me is the level design. Simply brilliant.",

Most of the music is okay, but some parts are particularly annoying, the 'Chase' sequence in particular got on my nerves.  My only other real complaint is that some of the platforming, particularly the segments involving wind are  ridiculously  luck based, this especially goes for 'Chase' which, in its current incarnation of patches and fixes, is completely unbeatable. Between the losing breaths just by falling the distance from one segment to the next, the poorly designed boosted jumps (the older style I see in videos of it was much better) and the fact that many platforms are designed to fly away literally before you can possibly get to the far edge of them (I'm looking at you particularly, last jump before the enclosed arches) it's literally either completely impossible to beat or reliant on such massive amounts of luck as to be completely irrational. Either way, I haven't been able to get to the end, through literally a few hundred tries, and.... well... from what I've seen, there really isn't an end anyways.",

Seriously though, it took me about 10 hours to complete. The first half of the game was relaxing, slow paced, with moments of stillness for trying to figure out where to go, and the last half is quite simply out of this world and like nothing I have seen in all my 20 years of gaming. I believe it won somekind of Indie Choice Award. And even though the last half was frustrating at times and had me helling at my computer screen (like it could hear me and could change the game because I said so) THIS GAME WAS WORTH THE EXPERIENCE!...

            "review_text": "NaissanceE is a very good game that could have been amazing, if not for a few unfortunate design choices.  In terms of the visual and audio design, and the 'cinematography' of the level design, the game is near perfect. Pauline Oliveros was the perfect choice for a soundtrack composer - in fact the cavernous environments in the game echo some of the settings in which she made some of her most well known recordings ('Suiren', for example, which was made in one of the world's largest subterranean cisterns). The art design choice to make textures minimal if not nonexistent and instead create visual interest via lighting also works extremely well, giving the game a tone both otherwordly and abstract. This is accentuated by the diverse level architecture, which deliberately and dramatically alternates between representational and abstract modes, and plays very effectively with scale.  In some was the most impressive, and for me most enjoyable aspect of NaissanceE is the way the designers managed to explore the various possible permutations of their chosen art style. Despite the fact that in some ways this style is minimalist, the sensation of playing the game is almost one of sensory overload. No one visual element overstays its welcome, no one theme or motif is overused. Uniqueness is the rule in this game, not the exception. If anything, I often felt a twinge of disappointment when moving to a new area, knowing that my time exploring my more immediate surroundings had come to an end.  Game-design wise, there are some wonderful moments. This is a rare game that succeeds in drawing out poignancy on the most intimate personal level as well as real awe and awareness of personal insignificance. Of particular note are the times when the concept of infinite landscapes or areas is played with, but other instances in which the rules of the game world otherwise shift or are temporarily broken over the game's course are extremely effective. There are few other games as capable of eliciting a feeling of wonder and a joy in exploration.  However, there are also some unfortunate choices. While the visual design is extremely varied, the rather puzzling choice was made to have certain reoccurring types of sections that are fundamentally unpleasant to play. I am thinking here particularly of a series of platforming 'puzzles' in which the player must make their way along a rod (often rotating) with various obstacles impeding progress. This idea is re-used several times and not one iteration fails to be annoying.  The controls are generally competent, but for a game that relies heavily on platforming, jumping is remarkably 'floaty' and imprecise, and it can be difficult to judge whether a given drop will be dangerous to the player character. This is made worse by several points in the game that feature strong winds capable of blowing the player character around. This is a fine idea in theory but is here frustrating in practice since the controls already make it difficult to know the exact relationship between player input and player character behavior.  One final annoyance is that even in the 'less pain, more pleasure' version of the game, checkpoints are placed at some very inconvenient spots. As mentioned before, the mechanics of the game alter at various points over the game's course and the game architecture can be very abstract. This results in somewhat frequent situations where the player is forced to guess what the designers intend her to do. There are also several junctures at which the player must make more-or-less split-second choices, the wrong choice resulting in the player character's death. None of these game-design choices by themselves are bad, but when they come together and the player is forced to make a split-second decision based entirely on guesswork and 'game-design intuition' it is extremely aggravating to guess wrong and be forced to either play through a large previous portion of the level or sit through long cutscenes that, though wonderful and fascinating the first time around, feel like adding insult to injury the second. This also applies to some degree to the platforming sections of the game, which can be quite lengthy and are all-too-easy to fail.  Given all this, I can only assume the game did not undergo proper playtesting, because these faults, particularly the last, would have easily been spotted and fixed during a well-run QA process. This makes it doubly saddening that the game was published with said faults glaringly un-remedied.  Nonetheless, despite all this I enjoyed NaissanceE greatly. I admire its ambition and salute the designers' courage in allowing their game to have such minimal explanation, little narrative structure, and in encouraging the player to experience extremes: vast emptiness as well as intimate and claustrophobic detail, dark and light, deafening noise and deaf silence. In the end, NaissanceE is polarizing as well as polarized. For those who find the conceptual depth of the game's art and its deft manipulation of space and light compelling, it is a flawed masterpiece. For those for whom these things are only distractions from its rather clunky mechanics and sometimes unexamined design, it is merely a waste of time.",

If you hit them and they move to the next platform that area is then lit up.

So refreshing to not really have to have characters, or a story, or powerups, or a series of objectives... Just an intriguing world to explore; It's features stark, abstract, and sometimes beautiful, it's purpose unknown, and perhaps unknowable. The music is fantastic when it appears and is always tied in perfectly with the aesthetics of your immediate environment.   There are genuine challenges to be found here and there, mostly in the form of abstract logic puzzles, but what the game really strives to create for the 'player' (perhaps 'participant' is a better word in this case) is a series of utterly unique experiences, eliciting awe, wonder, confusion, anxiety and, in smaller measure, but no less memorably, joy. The sheer scale of some of the environments will blow your mind, while others will constantly challenge your perceptions and deny you a clear, point-A-to-point-B objective. It is one of the few games I have played with the maturity to realise the important role that can be played by minimalism. It has its frantic moments, but they are made all the richer by the quiet, meditative chapters that can be found in between.  You could potentially finish the game in 6 or 7 hours, so based on that alone it might be a bit expensive.

I love Dear Ester and Verde Station, though I hate Gone Home because it's full of modern politics crap. That's why I bought this game searching for some artsy solitude that isn't ruined by some human story no one cares. Or maybe even some Lynch-like stuff, you know.  And I found that NaissanceE is very atmospheric and beautiful in it's simplicity game. Very symbolic and artistic, and makes your imagination go wild. Also NaissanceE is idiotic platformer full of bad design choices, annoying and boring. The game is absolutely empty meaningless canvas that tries hard to give you impression that you need to fill the gaps, but there is no gaps - the game is all empty space. NaissanceE might be a great place to think and imagine if it wasn't ruined by platforming sections and dumb puzzles.  So after NaissanceE my inner hipster is still starving. In the end it's very shallow and dull experience that you probably won't enjoy too. It is just a pretentious and bad designed platformer that tries hard to seem smart and fails even at that.",

Many moments found me motionless gawking at the impressive vista. Yet all the while there is a feeling that one should not tarry for fear of some unseen watcher.  The game is a 3D linear exploration game with the focus firmly on the level design. The developers even forgo textures relying solely on their masterful use of light and shadow. Your odyssey is enhanced by some mild platform jumping and puzzle solving challenges. The only drawbacks in this otherwise satisfying experience were a couple of long 'runs' that required more than the expected amount of restarts which in my opinion broke the sensory flow. All in all a gratifying affair.",

There is astounding large building. # It's like comic 'BLAME!', There is mysterious remains that has trace of human life. And, after 'Going down' level, this game goes to madness. But, you shouldn't afraid to talkative script about madness. NaissanceE express story by visual, then that is one of the most beautiful point of this game. At the end of this strange journey, you will see the 'biginning' at the second time in your life.  Game play: Mechanism of this game is very simple. Run, jump, crouch, that's all.
