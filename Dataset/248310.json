            "review_text": "You know whats unfortunate? Most people will get the wrong idea and will knock this game down. There's gonna be a ton of people who will just glance at this and will simply presume the game is a sonic knockoff.   Like with the recent indie game Shovel Knight, it takes elements from various classic games and makes it all its own identity. So does Freedom Planet with its different game play styles. You have characters that of course are fast like sonic, some fight like Zero from the Mega man games, and another who can bring up blocks via magic and throw them via Mario 2 style.  The gameplay yes, level designs take inspiration from sonic titles, along with bosses from games such as Gunstar Heroes, a bit of Ristar, and just this massive blend of genesis/super nintendo games all into one...yes it blends, do breathe this.   Story wise (no worries about spoilers) feels like a good old Saturday morning cartoon show with funny humor, fun characters, and can still be dark in some areas. Themes ranging from friendships, growing stronger, revenge that shift from various character viewpoints when playing the other characters.    There's a lot going on here, its worth the 15$ definitly with its content, and along with more coming along the way with an expansion which will add an adventure mode for Milla since she's only in classic at the moment, along with characters such as Spade and Torque somewhere down the line.   This game though does get hard at the very last few stages, NES hard but checkpoints are plenty and unlimited continues are in this so its not too bad. Just expect a challenge at the later half of the game.   Hopefully this game does become more popular with people on youtube giving this game more attention such as YOGSCAST and reviewers such as Somecallmejohnny and more, just to name a few. Spread the word, tell people about it, and treat it like the kind of game you'd keep in your retro game collection. No scratch that, treat it like the kind of game that stays fresh and fun for years to come, even after the millionith playthrough. Worth the cash, no doubt about it",

            "review_text": "Before I review  Freedom Planet , a disclaimer I feel important to mention: I have been an alpha tester for the game since April 2013, and am also a moderator of the game's forums/makeshift bug tracker. My opinions are based off not only the final product, but several unfinished builds of the game. I am probably  not  going to provide the least-biased, most-impartial opinion out there, although I will try; take this fact as you see fit.   Freedom Planet  is a 2D side-scrolling platformer, with a heavy emphasis on momentum-based physics and melee combat. Although its inspiration by Sega's seminal  Sonic the Hedgehog  franchise is self-evident, make no mistake; this game plays significantly differently, and hardly in a bad sense.  The plot centers around water-dragon Sash Lilac, a thief who lives a relatively solitary life in a treehouse, and her wildcat companion/roommate Carol Tea, an impulsive character with an amazing physics-defying motorcycle. The two girls rescue an unusual duck-billed turtle named Torque from his pursuers after he crash-lands in the jungle, but in doing so, are thrust into his attempt to thwart the impending theft of an artifact precious to their world of Avalice - the Kingdom Stone, the object that gives Avalice's people the ability to power their various devices and as such live their daily lives. Along the way, they ally with the hound dog Milla Basset, a shy, naive homeless orphan living on her own in the wild (and who is decidedly  not  a rabbit, despite her long ears), and discover the involvement of military leader Lord Brevon, who wants the Kingdom Stone for his own nefarious purposes, but whose origin is apparently not of their world.  The gameplay is pretty simple in execution. You control either Lilac, Carol or Milla (although you have to unlock that last one; she becomes available just for playing two stages of the other two girls' campaigns, but can only access Classic Mode as of writing), and get them from point A to point B, where a Treasure-esque multi-part boss of some fashion awaits, with the intent of slaughtering you. Each of these stages have their own unique hazards and mechanics to come to terms with: whether that's dodging oversized mining equipment, fending off three themed enemy airships, riding the back of a submarine as it bobs up and down in the water or dealing with ninjas on motorcycles, there's always something new being thrown at you, but very rarely is it so abrupt as to be unfair. The usual assortment of power-ups help you on your quest: crystals for extra lives (naturally, although the magic number is 200 instead of the usual 100), health petals to patch up wounds (or to double as crystals when you're full-health), little heads in cages as quick extra lives, and various large crystals that, when shattered, provide you with a shield (themed after Wu Xing, each offering at least two additional hits separate from your health bar, protection from attacks of their element, and some subtle bonuses besides).  The three characters go through the stages with significantly different playstyles:  * Lilac can zoom around like Sparkster with her Dragon Boost, can perform a low-gravity double-jump with her Dragon Cyclone, and generally has the widest variety in her basic attacks. She's also easily the fastest on-foot of all the characters, making her a good all-rounder. * Carol can wall-climb, spin like a certain hedgehog, leap around from jump pad to jump pad or zoom around on a bike that can implausibly drive up walls and ladders. On the flipside, she generally has weaker attacks than Lilac (although they whip out faster) and is slower on-foot. * Milla can fly to a limited extent, can throw objects for ranged attacks (like item boxes or a self-generated block), can deflect some enemy attacks with a shield (itself an attack, as its dissipation shoots outwards; its power increases when combined with a generated block) and can dig things out of patches of dirt; all the typical things dogs do. However, she is slower than Carol and has less health than her companions.  Each character also sees some things the others don't, whether that's an extended version of a cutscene, a different boss or an entire stage solely exclusive to them, further incentivizing playing as all three.  Those familiar with deviantART (for better or worse) might recognize the three heroines. That's no accident; the characters were licensed from Chinese artist Ziyo-Ling, who used the trio many years ago on her dA page (although Lilac's species was changed from a hedgehog to a dragon, to make the inspirations a  little  less blatant). I'm not going to lie, when I first heard of the game many years ago, I thought it sounded like the dumbest idea imaginable to take those three fan characters and slap them into their own game. However, a demo of the game in 2012 quickly changed my mind, with surprisingly strong gameplay mechanics, fluid animations, and catchy music - such that, when the game went up on Kickstarter, I didn't think twice about pledging $30 for beta access (only to bump it up another $20 for alpha access instead).  Fortunately, those qualities have carried through the rest of development. As part of the Kickstarter's stretch goals, the graphics were given a once-over, adding shading to the previously flat-shaded sprites and even touching up the level art. More stages kept coming in, and alongside them several new enemies, difficult bosses and kickass music tracks. I might have had some misgivings with some changes here and there, but by-and-large, this game was pretty much what I imagined when I pledged. I suspect the art style will remain a turn off for some, but for them to skip it completely because of that would be doing themselves a disservice.  I won't say everything's perfect. The plot is pretty good, but doesn't explain some plot events or the general backstory of Avalice well enough, leaving some plot holes that would need to be touched up in future patches (it's tougher for me to gauge as I've been following the game's development closely to catch little factoids in forum discussions here and there, but I expect a newcomer to be left having some questions). Adventure Mode was slated to have various hubs you could visit to access the game's stages and heal up between them, but these had to be cut in the final product, rendering Adventure Mode little more than 'cutscenes, please' as opposed to Classic Mode's 'next stage, please'. The game is pretty easy once you get the hang of how it works, although the final stages and bosses are challenging enough to offset that (plus, it'll still be difficult to do a no-miss clear). The colored spheres you collect from enemies and treasure chests scattered about the levels do nothing more than act as currency for a gambling bonus stage at this immediate moment (a new character planned for a free future update is supposed to make better use of them, but that obviously won't apply to the initial launch). Some of the music fades out and restarts, instead of looping seamlessly (this one never bothered me, but it annoys other people).  That said, do any of those flaws irreparably mar the experience? To be blunt: no. The core gameplay is so much fun that it trumps any of the things working against it. It might be inspired heavily by other franchises, but I think the resulting mixture is something more than a cynical rip-off; it's a spirited little adventure that evokes the best of '90s gaming. Frankly, that's a game worth a look.  At the very least, try the demo linked to from the store page. It'll only take about half an hour of your time, letting you try both Lilac and Carol through the first one-and-a-half stages (Milla being exclusive to the paid product). Who knows; if you're skeptical, maybe playing it and seeing how well it comes together will change your mind.",

            "review_text": "I did not want to like Freedom Planet. The trailer couldn't focus on a single part of gameplay for very long, and it just had the main characters parroting lines that vaguely explain the plot but have little context cohesion. Then again, what's there to explain as far as context goes? BIG EVIL GREEN GUY is destroying PLANET CHINA. You must destroy  Metal Gear  the space invaders before they destroy you!  Without spoiling anything important, I'll just say that I enjoyed every bit of the story. Yes, parts of it were campy and it had a few plot-holes that probably aren't going to be filled for a while, and some of the jokes feel a bit forced when short-rich-kid is onscreen, but that can all be forgiven. Most of it's clean, and it's a light-hearted adventure where you get to be Hero-Pants (not her real name), a badass dragon-girl with hair-tentacles that can do the shoryuken! She's joined by a kung-fu catgirl on a motorcycle (her best friend), a not-evil space invader (who has a grudge against the main villain), and some orphan girl (plot significance unknown for the time being but she does some cool things in the background) on a quest to prevent the theft of a sacred artifact that provides power to the three neighboring countries involved in the story.  No, they never mentioned 'The Three Kingdoms' in 'Planet China.' The writers are more subtle than I am.   In fact, the writing is really good. The villain is competent, correctly identifies the main threats to his plans, and doesn't sit on his rear-end waiting for Hero Pants to come destroy everything. He actively sets effective traps, ambushes, and even gets down to business personally when his subordinates start having trouble with certain player-controlled obstacles. He even gets a torture scene despite this being an E-rated game, complete with interrogation. The writers didn't pull any punches here: a competent villain is a villain players take seriously.  Hero-Pants herself, by comparison, is a pretty flat character. She's the hero, she kicks butt, she keeps a cool head in risky situations, and is the first to jump head-first into any situation where a hero is needed. In short, she's what she needs to be as a character, but she's also a cool big sister to the orphan girl she adopts. Hero-Pants also distinguishes herself by existing in a story where nobody ever criticizes or mocks her for being female, and the game itself never forces her into an awkward, forced romance sub-plot. She may not have much that makes her 'special,' but she's a great protagonist and the writers are awesome for their work on her.  Even in gameplay, the three playable characters have different movesets and playstyles. Hero-Pants is the overall 'best at everything' character, Carol is strong but requires a little more skill to use in melee and has to climb walls like Rockman X instead of just floating or dash-attacking upward, and Milla has less health but makes up for it with ranged attacks and a shield.   The levels are fairly typical for the style of game: you have a jungle level, a sewer level, aquatic ruins, a spaceship, an ancient temple, a couple of snow levels, and the rest of the usual goodies. That said, there are only two levels with 'pitfall deaths' and it's completely logical to have them in those levels because you're either on dogfighting airships or on a spaceship where the airlocks have been opened. There are a couple of moments where the design could use a little polish, but overall it shouldn't be too difficult to get through the levels.  The bosses can be a different story, though. After a few levels they start to reach Rockman / Gunstar Heroes difficulty, which is *extremely welcome* in a platforming game. Part of me hates to admit it, but I actually had to turn the difficulty down to 'Easy' in order to beat the final two levels, and I *still* had a lot of trouble against the final boss in his 'I don't need my giant mech, I'll just take care of you in melee' form. Again, loving that the game doesn't hold the players' hand or pull its punches in the boss fights. It just makes the victory that much more satisfying, just like how classic gaming was.   I think my favorite moment in the game is the boss fight where the four primary heroes team up to battle a giant battlemech while racing through the streets. There's another team-up boss fight in the game, but this one comes out of nowhere and it's  awesome!   Just try not to get too caught up in why the citizens of Planet China use medieval weaponry and armor while having access to telephones, television, cyborgs and 'databases' detailing the lives of the planet's inhabitans.  ___________  As it's sort-of rated to be a childrens' game, I can't say it's perfect. Some of the plot elements are a little dark, but chances are if a kid is familiar at all with video games, they've seen worse. Maybe wait until your kid's nine or ten years old before getting this for them. That said, it's possibly the only E-rated game I've ever played that treats its female characters with the same amount of respect it gives male characters. I could recommend this game for that detail alone, but it has so much more going for it.   Vee's Rating: 'I wish I had hair-tentacles that could do the shoryuken.'",

            "review_text": "The fact there is finally a game like this is a miracle. A sonic fangame gone rogue, its become some kind of astonishing hybrid of all the best Genesis titles, blended together in a fine puree. Some critics will argue that the game suffers from being slower-paced than the Sonic games we are all reminded of by this title--this is missing the point. This is what Sonic should have been all along. Let's get real, the Sonic franchise is not self-sustainable. I've played the old Sonic games and then thought to myself, what if I could have more? I thought about what that would mean, to have Treasure-inspired bossfights in a Sonic game. How would that look? How could you do that with the ring system? I've dreamt of working on a game like this, hoping that it would exist at all, but I kinda gave up on that concept many many years ago.  But here it is. Here it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is, in a glorious mix of Rocket Knight, Ristar, Gunstar Heroes, Pulse Man, and yes of course Sonic. Hell there is even some Megaman in the stage design if you pay attention.  Is it a perfect game? No. Is it the perfect game for me? Oh my god yes. There is not much of a clear difficulty curve until the very end. The first two levels are easy enough but its hard to pick out a boss fight that's anything less than an adrenaline rush. If you don't like the pacing of oh say, Gunstar Heroes... No nevermind that thought. Gunstar Heroes is awesome, screw you. Voice acting, not perfect. There's a super adorable character who the writing and acting side of me can't stand and yet I still find her cute? Without a doubt the main antagonist's voice acting steals the show. Look forward to that! You will also notice some curious sprite imperfections. I won't call them errors just oversights. Game can slowdown at times and will cause button inputs to get lost in translation, sometimes at critical moments. That could use some work if possible, but its something you can compensate for by acting quickly. Some of the boss attacks are slightly cheap. You won't know they're coming the first time around.  Pretend its a Sonic game made by Treasure, then give it an actually attention holding plotline. Real basic stuff but they told it right and most of the characters are actually 3Dimensional. Those that aren't are 2Dimensional and that's more than I can say for the Sonic franchise (or Treasure for that matter).  But don't let any of that fool you. References to Treasure and Sonic team aside, this is GalaxyTrail now. Look what they did. They deserve a career. Give them a career. I will hunt you down if you don't give them a career. Cuz if they get and maintain some momentum people will be comparing future games to GalaxyTrail and Sonic Team and Treasure might become relics.",

            "review_text": "ORIGINAL REVIEW I saw a cat on a mototcycle and had to check this out. This game has ended up being one of the best choices i've ever made on steam. This game is done in the style of the classic Sonic games, but with multiple playable characters with varying abilities. The soundtrack and environments in this game are STUNNING, the character designs are interesting and well sprited, and the bosses are really cool. I've heard complaints about the voice acting, but it's nothing worse than anything SEGA has put out making actual Sonics. The story is kind of cheesy but honestly what do you expect. I really enjoyed the characters personally. For those not interested in cutscenes there's a classic mode that's just the levels all strung together as well. After all these good things though, the best part of this game by far is the actual gameplay. I cannot stop playing this game. I accidentally blew almost 5 hours playing it before I knew any time had passed. If i could reccomend any game on steam right now it would probably be this one.  NEW ONE Ok so I'm sitting here with 100 hours dedicated to this game and I still play it pretty much every day. All three of the characters play differently enough that I've become dedicated to learing all of them, and the achivements for speedrunning and no death clearing are some of the proudest i have on steam. Originally i thought i'd clear this game once and be done with it, but I literally cannot stop playing this game. Once you become experienced with handling this game speedrunning your favorite stages (Jade Creek &lt;3) is a blast. Hard mode is really quite difficult on some of the stages, and it's really rewarding to complete. I cannot recommend this game highly enough if you enjoy either fast games or platformers.",

So the curve was a bit wonky, at least on the normal difficulty level. Cutscenes are a bit too long, voice acting is okay for an indie game.  All in all, my playthrough was the most fun I have had with games this year overall. And in my opinion this is the best modern retro game I have played thus far.

I would recommend that in the (glorious) event of a Freedom Planet 2 being created, that the levels are split into Acts so that individual levels don't stretch out to over fifteen minutes. This helps out in regards to wanting to play a few levels and then having to go out somewhere and lose all your progress. So a level like Dragon Valley (which can take up to around 10 minutes when you're screwing around a little) would be split into Dragon Valley Act 1 and Act 2, with the miniboss of the level being at the end of Act 1, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles style.  Also, not a Sonic 'rip-off', but Sonic 'inspired'. Amazing game in general, would love a sequel. Also, HD sprites would be absoulutely glorious. Go hire the artists of Sonic 2 HD or something.",

And, if you find that you just can't stand it, there are options to avoid it.   All in all, taking into consideration that this is the first major game produced by this development team and that they didn't have a million dollar budget to work with, I give this game a 9/10.

Gameplay-wise, it's impeccable, with just the right blend of difficulty and flow, and the multiple characters give it strong replay value to experience the different gameplay styles Freedom Planet offers.  Where the game stumbles a bit is in the Adventure Mode; right out of the gate, several pronouns are thrown at you and are never given any real explanation. The game just expects you to go along with it's logic from beginning to end. While some explanations are offered, the often-times clumsy dialogue make it difficult to get a grasp on what's actually going on. Humor is hit-or-miss, as is the voice acting. Still, the story has occasional gripping moments that will make up for the shortcomings for many.   Classic mode is there for those who can't quite bring themselves to deal with the plot but want to experience the fantastic level design, art, and music, offering a win-win for everyone. The game is long enough to feel filling without falling into the trap of padding. The level design is fantastic, never allowing you a moment to become bored. Some bosses attack patterns are unforgiving bordering on unfair, but it doesn't quite go too far. Eventually the reflexes will come.   Freedom Planet still holds onto the redundant life system, even though a Game Over really doesn't set you back whatsoever; you start at the same checkpoint you would have were lives not a factor at all. Since it doesn't effect gameplay, it's not really a complaint, but its inclusion dilutes what would otherwise be an efficient and impressively formatted gameplay system.  The Adventure Mode will be the big deciding factor for players. If you're willing to stomach some cheesiness or skip the story altogether, you will have the opportunity to experience one of the most solid platformers of the year. For the gameplay experience alone, you can't go wrong with Freedom Planet.  8.5/10",

            "review_text": "I have to admit, as a backer of the Kickstarter, I wasn't sold on the demo.  But it's come SUCH a long way since then! What I actually played of it, yesterday and today, shows an exemplary understanding of level design that's rarely seen these days. I think the great era of platformers ended with the original Jak &amp; Daxter and Ratchet &amp; Clank on the PS2, there have been some decent ones since then, but that was it so far as the greats go.  This, however, feels like it belongs in that time, but mixes in modern sensibilities. I'll explain.  First of all, it feels like a love letter to the originality of the Mega Drive (or Genesis, if you so prefer), picking the most eccentric of the platformers to draw inspiration from. One of those fonts is definitely Sonic, yes, but it goes further than that. It also feels a bit like Gunstar Heroes, and with just a hint of something like Alisia Dragoon thrown into the mix. The execution of this rather rambunctious recipe is simply sublime. A lot of platformers which try to be like the golden era of platforming have loads of issues either with level design, the controls, or the overall feel of movement. Freedom Planet gets these things right, it has them down pat from the get go.  And to speak to its modern sensibilities -- it has a casual mode, so those friends who found Sonic too frustrating can finally understand what you saw in those old games, it has some memorable characters, and it has fairly decent writing. Now, understand, they're not GREAT characters or writing, but they're definitely serviceable, and better than what we were offered back in the Dreamcast and PS2 days. The voice acting, however, is cheesy, but not cheesy enough to be reminiscent of those days, either. I'd say that the overall execution of this part of the game is very competent, enough so as to be enjoyable rather than grating. But your mileage may vary.  Finally, if I have but one criticism, it's of the aesthetic. Notably of the curves in some of the levels that look like they were cut by na orbital laser scalpel for the purpose of existing within the levels. Some kind of outline, jagginess, or suggestion of naturally formed rock might help. Even just some moss or vines. To me, it's an issue that serves to distract me from time to time, as it is quite jarring.  Furthermore, I think that the floating islands could use some more background decoration rather thanjust their foreground presence. This latter aspect is an area where I feel that lots of platformers fail, old and new. Some get it right, and a floating platform will be held up by a crane or some structure in the background, or it'll have some more presence in the background to give it more meat. I know it's a floating platform, but some of them are really, really thin, and they feel more like floating astroturf for that reason. Just having some background to make them feel more like a floating chunk of rock or whatnot would help solve this issue.  Both of those issues are graphical, so if they won't bother you, you'll love this game. I'd give it five stars, but the distractions and annoyances of the graphical deficiencies mean I have to dock it to 4 and a ½.  Still, that's a very strong recommendation, and it's MEANT to be. This is a pretty groovy game.",

However, it does have it's own original points, so don't exactly expect, say, Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode III or Sonic 5.  Anyway, I found the game to be rather great. The level design was good, I liked the characters, the music, pretty much everything about it. Although, the game does have a bit of challenge, especially in later levels, but that just adds on to the fun of the game.  And the game isn't hard to run at all. While I usually use my desktop, this game actually runs (at around 60FPS in fact) on my Toshiba notebook from 2010 running Linux Mint, so I doubt you'll run into any optimization issues or anything.  Overall, I definitely recommend this game. Whether you're a fan of retro games or just want a good platformer, this game is rather fun. From me, this game definitely gets a 10/10.",

CONS: -The story has some holes to fill but those will be fixed with DLC characters and their stories (for free).  If you like 4th and early 5th generation platformers then this is a game for you! Don't let this fantastic game fall by the wayside!  P.S. MANY people seem to have problems with the difficulty of this game. My first playthrough was on Hard and it felt just right to me, I'm not sure if those that are having trouble are playing on Hard or not. I know that when the game was first released people were having problems, but the developer, in response, put out an 'Easy' difficulty for the game as well as heavily nerffing the bosses on all difficulties except for Hard (with plays just like it did on release day).  So if you are having trouble with the bosses and aren't playing on Hard I can't really say anything else other than 'Get better at the game' or 'Switch the difficulty to Casual'.",

            "review_text": "Freedom Planet is a pretty tight platformer that's kind of like a mishmash of Sonic and Ristar with one character, or like Sonic and Gunstar Heroes mixed with some other thing with another character. The way these characters play so differently while being able to play the same stages is a pretty good indicator that the devs had at least some idea what they were doing. Maybe some of it was a happy accident, who knows? Point is it's good and it's fun.   Look, I grew up on the Genesis. Maybe that's why the game grabbed me at first. Honestly though, it doesn't really make me feel like I'm playing one because of the fully voiced cutscenes and dialogue, which would be a problem if it actually mattered. I'm not crazy on the cutscenes, the story or whatnot, but they're nice enough to consider 'hey maybe people just want to play the game,' so there's a mode that's just playing the levels, and if you accidentally started story mode you get to just skip over all the cutscenes. Good feature.  Now I know a lot of you are saying that the bosses are unfair, that you have to try multiple times to figure them out before you even have a chance. While that's not entirely true, I will say you're probably going to lose a life or two before you pick up on some of the later boss patterns, even if you're perceptive. I know a lot of people would rather die before they tone down the difficulty, but there's actually a great feature where you can lower the difficulty before you load your file. (I mean not that I needed it, but as I said I grew up on the Genesis so I might be more used to the challenge.)  I guess what I'm saying is the game's good and the biggest complaints I'm seeing have workarounds.  ...One complaint though, maybe patch in an audio slider. It's not a big deal in the era of audio mixers but it's a good feature to have so you don't have to mess around outside the game to adjust it to your liking.   GOOD GAME I LIKE / 10",

            "review_text": "A little masterpiece. After playing the demo last year, I was anticipating this game with very high expectations, and it surpassed all of them.  The short story is that this is Sonic, on the top of his career, as programmed by Treasure (on their Gunstar Heroes/Alien Soldier days), with a colorful cast of characters, a decent sense of humor, very nicely-voiced cutscenes with in-game visuals, and vibrant boss battles. All accompanied with excellent digital music and colorful, crisp sprites, all very 16-bit, but without limitations of the era.  The game's story brings an old-China-styled world, pitted against a technologically advanced warlord. On the side of the good guys, we have Lilac and Carol, two adventurers of sorts, who get involved into the events of the game after coming to the rescue of Torque, a commander who was fighting against the antagonist Lord Brevon, a rare relatively intelligent villain, who crash-landed in the planet and attempts to take over a powerful energy source for his own ship, while causing infighting amount warring nations as a distraction. The game is divided in stages with two sections each. The setting and music of the stage changes with each section, so the game keeps changing environments pretty fast, with each stage having a number of unique gimmicks to them. The structure of the levels is a good reason this can be compared to a Sonic game, because it uses very large levels, with massive individual tiles, designed for speed and throwing in loops and curved terrain and so on. However, this is only at a visual level, as it plays in a fairly different fashion.   Each character plays radically different to each other. Lilac herself plays very similar to what you'd expect from a Sonic game, with emphasis on speed, but also good melee combat abilities and combat moves. While running she plays like Sonic, while fighting she plays like Zero from Megaman X4, with upper and downward attacks, a double jump (that also serves as a low-power high-rate attack) and a damaging dash attack. Carol however has weak but fast melee attacks, and can't double jump, but can instead leap forward during jump, giving her pretty good movement capabilities, and she can also walljump, so she navigates the maps in a radically different fashion than Lilac. Her best thing is an unique powerup, a motorcycle she can ride until she receives enough damage. Her speed becomes as good as Lilac, can double-jump, speed boost, and she's even able to ride over vertical surfaces or stairs, while retaining her kicking abilities. If you are skilled enough to keep her bike, she's easily the best. After playing a bit of story mode, you'll unlock Milla, a younger character who also plays even more radically different than the other two, being able to summon energy cubes that she can toss as a projectile, extend barriers that reflect enemy attacks and dispel in a directional short-range burst, and combining both things to create a mid-range beam attack. She can also dig items from the ground and has a limited form of flight. Because of this, she plays nothing like the other two, and traversing maps with her is even more different with the same architecture. She is also far, far stronger than her cutesy looks suggest, being able to demolish bosses with little effort if played right (and she also has the most effective range)  Boss battles are plain memorable and intense. Except the first, which is not a taste of things to come. From stage 2 onwards, bosses scalate in intensity, becoming bigger, more aggressive and way more over-the-top, some even having your companions join in battle, culminating with an really memorable fight against Brevon, who is no definitely no pushover, and pulls off a magnificent display of villainry, using everything he has to fight your heroine of choice. And the best is that you even are motivated to go kick his green ♥♥♥ due to certain events in the late game, making the fight even more satisfying. Some can be tough for some players, but some reflexes and memory will be enough to succeed. It's that kind of game where dying is your fault, as it has no artificial difficulty added to it. Tough but fair.  The story starts off pretty weak, a bit rushed perhaps (Milla becomes best friends forever with the other two main characters in 3 seconds flat), but after stablishing itself, it grows on you and becomes interesting enough to care. All the three main girls are really badass in their own right, and some of the NPCs and enemies are also very memorable as well. Some are even actually kinda funny. And the villain is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but actually does things instead of sitting on his throne waiting for the story to reach him. You get the impression of the guy being an actual threat, and succeeds at doing many things, which kinda motivates the player to keep going to see how things unfold. But well, as good as he is at being a bad guy, nothing can fight SOMEONE WHO CAN JUMP-KICK HELICOPTERS IN THE FACE WHILE RIDING A BIKE.  Also, the amount of enemies makes the fact that you are fighting an army quite believable. Which is a nice touch.  Presentation is spectacular. It uses the same design principles of old-school console games, but with no technical limitations, so it looks old, but shiny enough to look good. Sprite art is animated pretty nicely, uses plenty of vibrant, saturated colors, using many color motifs for each background and playfield. Lots of nice effects give emphasis to every relevant action, with tons of little sound effects mixed in. The result looks very polished and you can tell the ones behind it have a genuine love of the craft. It looks like a high-profile 2D game in the PSX era, perhaps even a bit better.  Sound design is also notoriously well done, with lots of catchy tunes of great quality, every sub-level has its own unique theme and most bosses have their own unique theme as well, so the soundtrack is quite rich and varied. Stage themes range from cheery to relaxed, to calm to fast-paced, and tend to match the environment pretty well. Boss themes are very fast-paced, intense pieces that add to the showy feeling of the game. Sound effects are placed quite well, and voice acting is surprisingly good for an indie game, specially in the cutscenes. No one comes off as sounding bad, and some characters like the Magistrate or Lilac herself have really good voice actors, and no voice sounds like it doesn't belong to a given character.  Replay value is not the best, but if you like old-school games, it's that kind of skill-based game that you can run in half an evening and have fun while at it once in a while. You can collect a number of hidden items in stages, as well as trying score and speed runs for achievements or personal bests. You can also play a simpler mode without story, just gameplay sections, and a time attack mode. There's also a challenge mode of sorts, and a couple difficulty levels. Playing the game with each one of the heroines is really different though, and each one has an unique stage suited to her abilities.   Overall, Freedom Planet is a really competent sidescrolling action game, with a lot of careful polish and dare I say, love into it. It looks great for the chosen aesthetic, sounds great for the chosen style, and while it might look like a Sonic wannabe, it's definitely everything the Sonic Team has failed to deliver after the golden age of Sonic, and much, much more. It is an old formula given years of refinement and care, and the coolness feels more genuine than some 90's 'tude.",

Heavily inspired by the Sonic the Hedgehog series with a pinch of Rocket Knight Adventures, this game is a must-have if you were a SEGA kid.  Freedom Planet has a great sense of speed but not too much where you will constantly crash into upcoming obstacles like later 2D Sonic games. The levels themselves are quite expansive and when you make your way through them you’ll experience challenging boss fights and cutscenes with full voice acting.  Multiple characters which unique gameplay and levels as well as different modes add to play the replayability of this game. I can’t not mention the soundtrack either, which is amazing.   If the idea of an expansive, modernised take on 16-bit Sonic and the above sounds appealing Freedom Planet is right up your alley.",

Which makes me sad, because games that are this well made are truly an experience.  It feels fantastic to play this game. At times, I would forget that the objective was to go as fast as possible. Instead, I would want to wander around the stages, collecting happy colors and sound effects. It's apparent from the beginning just how much work went into this game. It's staggering. Everything blends together into a satisfying mesh of speed and wonder. Gameplay is fine tuned and polished; to the point I was sad that it had to end sometime.  Now, this game is by no means perfect. I do have to bring up some issues. Character development, namely. The game has good character design, but doesn't know how to develop these characters; leading to flat one note personalities. In a game that obviously wants you to care about these characters, it sure has a hard time giving us a reason to. Cutscenes don't reveal anything remotely important about these characters beyond the basics; and by the time endgame came around, I was flipping through mindlessly until the next stage started. Side characters are even more worthless, which is a shame.  A few other minor complaints here and there: having to hear 'Cyclone!' every half minute is annoying, but easy to ignore once you're engrossed in the gameplay and the setting. There's also some reused assets here and there; and honestly it didn't bother me a lot aside from a few choice moments in the game. There's something to be said about a game that can make you disregard reused assets.  When I examine the fine details of this game, I see a lot of ideas that were interesting. Most of the time, Freedom Planet is a fun ride. But, it fails in its additional ambitions. However. when I look at the big picture, I see a game that tried to be proficient in everything; but still managed to be good game overall.",

            "review_text": "Were you a Sega Genesis fan back in the day? Then this isthe a must buy. Were you not a Genesis fan? Then this game is still really good.  Freedom Planet is a platform similar to Sonic the Hedgehog. Similar is the key word here. Do not goin expecting this to be exactly like Sonic. There are plenty of differences. While the speed based gameplay is there, it borrows elements from many other Genesis titles as well including Rocket Knight Adventures, Gunstar Heroes, and Vectorman.  There are three playable characters and they all play differently from one another to balance them out. Some levels and bosses are harder with some characters and some are easier. Try all three to figure out which you like best.  The game has three modes; Adventure, Classic, and a trial mode. Adventure is the story mode andpersonally this is the game's greatest weakness. The story is not bad, but not good either. It is very uninteresting. There are plenty of cringe-worthy moments as well as a few engaging moments but for themost part it is very hard to get invested into it. It is worth playing through once with each of the two characters available in the mode just to see, but unless you really want those achievements, it is best to leave this mode once you have done that.  Classic mode is much more similar to a classic platformer. In this mode you play through the levels without the story in between. The gameplay is very good and responsive, thus his is the way to play the game once you have seen the story. You have access to all three characters here, which offers even more playability.  Time trials are as the title would say. Beat the levels presented as fast as possible. The most notable thing about this mode is that you do not just play through all of the levels from Adventure and Classic mode. There are other trials unique to this mode which is a nice addition and gives this mode a purpose aside from being Classic mode with a time challenge.  The visuals in this game are just amazing. The artstyle is very reminiscent of games like Sonic CD and Ristar. This is the right way to do retro graphics. They aren't Atari 2600 graphics put through filter; they're real 16 bit graphics. Some may be put off by the character designs, but this is only noticeable in Adventure mode. It becomes a non-issue in the other modes since there isn't any attachment to the characters. You just play the game. The music and sound effects are very well done as well. I can definitely hear Sonic CD style music in there, but I get hints of Streets of Rage and Gunstar Heroes all the time. It's good enough to be memorable. I still have themain theme stuck in my head.  On a side-note, I have heard this game was originally a Sonic fan project and just looking at the characters in the story a lot of them could easily be replaced by Sonic characters from the SATAM series. This is not a knock on the game nor is it praising it. It is just an observation and makes me wonder what could have been.  Seriously, this is a game for Sega Genesis fans and platformer fans alike. The gameplay blends Sonic the Hedgehog and Rocket Knight Adventures, the boss fights are reminiscent of Gunstar Heroes and Vectorman, the level themes have similariies to Sonic, Ristar, and Shinobi, and a great soundtrack that reminds of Sonic CD, Streets of Rage, and Gunstar Heroes. The story is this game's biggest downfall but is just a small portion. If you write this game off as furry trash, you are not only closed minded but missing out on a really great game. This game is easily a 9/10 with an uninteresting story dragging the score down just slightly.",

When you have games like Shovel Knight inspired by Capcom, and CrossCode inspired by SNES RPG games, and the granddaddy of fan-made inspiring titles, Pier Solar and the Great Architects, we have too much proof in the pudding that gaming today isn't dead.

Multiple characters with distinct playstyles. High-speed aerial dashing melee combat in a China-steam-laser-crystal-punk playground of a world. An amazing upbeat adventure score that I purchased after an hour of play. A new movement element or substantial game asset you will barrel through every 15 seconds in a world that never seems to stay still long enough to wear out its welcome.  I think that the worst thing I can say about it is that the story, writing and acting are for the most part saturday-morning-cartoon level fare; while some may understandably find this a little cringeworthy, it suits a colorful romp like this. It provides the occasional genuine chuckle and subtle uses of the 16-bit sprites do often express character surprisingly well.  Ultimately, though, it's a bit of context for what one ultimately comes to Freedom Planet to do: Drive a motorbike or a dragon girl through a combination of loops and robots to a backdrop of glowing lights and joyful music.  All in all it's an utter delight to play and behold, and I cannot sing its praises highly enough - a song that will be sung to the tune of 'Dragon Valley 1.'",

Those elements combined make for one of the best games I've played recently.  Diving in one by one, in terms of playable characters, Sash Lilac, to me, derives from Classic Sonic. Hair whips, her Dragon Cyclone, and Dragon Boost make her ideal for blazing through stages with practically no reason to stop. Her personality is very similar to Sonic's with a strong sense of justice and compassion.  Carol Tea, with her various claw attacks, her Wild Kick, and her wall jumping abilities, make her unique for close combat. She seems to me, more laid back, a lot like Tails to some extent, but these are just comparisons. Carol is a major tomboy, if it wasn't already obvious.  Milla Basset... She's actually one of the more interesting characters to me. Her nature, makes her very likeable. Her abilities, with her Phantom Block and laser make for quite an experience, especially when you combine her moves. That and the upcoming update I've heard about, I can see how Milla came to be. I'm honestly excited for that.  The soundtrack, oh man, I love this thing, special mention going to Prince Dail's boss theme, Aqua Tunnel 2, and Fortune Night 2. It's got quite the variety in terms of music genres, and I like that. The bloopers in the cutscenes were pretty funny too, especially the segment where Spade's like 'G****** my coolness.' The level design is really cool too. To me, it follows Sonic 3's formula in terms of act transition. The levels themselves are awesome. and near the end of the game, things get REALLY hectic.  Overall, Freedom Planet made for an awesome experience from beginning to end, and I'd love to see more content come out soon. Anyway, I highly recommend this game.",

The characters' animations are all lifelike and colorful, and the bosses are awe-inspiring. Clearly a lot of work went into all the sprites. There's even a neat little easter egg in the third level where the characters dance!  The gameplay is incredibly fun. The levels are huge, with lots of room to explore. This was inspired by Sonic, so expect loop-de-loops and running on walls, but the overall pace isn't as 'go-go-go' as Sonic is. There are multiple ways to get through any given level, too - so replaying one level can actually feel like exploring a whole new one at times. There are three characters at time of writing, with two more on the way, and all of them have vastly different playstyles. For example, Lilac is speedy and strong, with a double-jump and a speed-boost attack; on the other hand, Carol trades all-out speed for the capability to scale walls, smash enemies with her Wild Kick move, and even  ride a motorcycle!   The bosses are quite interesting - early on, they're pretty simple, but later on, they get crushingly hard. You have to pay close attention to their attack patterns if you're ever going to survive. The final boss smashed me 25 times before I eventually conquered it - but I enjoyed every second.  On the subject of difficulty, there are four modes - Casual, Easy, Normal, and Hard. Casual is easier than easy - you take scarcely any damage, even from the most powerful foes, and your health regenerates to boot. Easy keeps the regenerating health, but you take the same damage as usual; but Hard is brutal at times. If you're looking for a challenge, that'll satisfy alright.  While the story is not one of its strong points, with some pacing issues in the cutscenes, there is a 'Classic Mode' that lets you play through the levels in order without a single cutscene to be seen, if you prefer it that way. Nonetheless, I actually enjoyed the story, despite its cheesy bits.  All things considered, Freedom Planet is not without its flaws, but they're few and far between. For a mere $15, it is definitely worth your time and money. What are you doing still reading this?! Go play it and see!  tl;dr: This game is absolutely amazing. Go buy it right now.",

The boss fights are also very enjoyable as it has a Megaman X feel to it. I would enjoy Sonic games but hated the newer recent ones where you have to speed race to the finish. But what about getting everything there is to get on the level or secrets like in the old sonic games? I enjoy the style of this game and you can either explore or race to the finish without being stopped by much. Has an amazing arcade feel especially with a USB controller. It has interesting puzzles and the level structure is wonderful. The soundtrack is beautiful! (I'm going to purchase the OST soon) and it's just such a great game altogether. I wouldn't be fooled by the cartoony arcade look. It's worth the cost to play this wonderfully written game!

I just knew that it was something that was originally going to be a Sonic fangame before the creator decided to turn it into an original IP instead using the same engine and that people were going *crazy* for it.  I may not really care for Sonic that much these days, but these people're right to go crazy for this. This is the snappiest, most enjoyable platformer I've played in a REALLY long time. I'd even say that I enjoy this almost as much as 'Rayman Legends', even (and that says a LOT). Beneath the Sonic-esque character designs and familiar (and very nicely handled) level design riffs that tip their hat to classic Sonic games, you have a platformer that somehow takes the familiar and makes it feel fresh again.   Really big, long levels that never really lose their momentum and fun despite their lengths, fantastic controls and ultra-fluid combat, the nicest looking pixel-centric graphics an indie game of this type has had in a really long time and REALLY nice music that rivals even some of the best music from classic Sonic games IMO just to name just a few of the things that work so well in this game and elevate it to more than just 'a Sonic fangame that isn't'.  Honestly, I like to think of 'Freedom Planet' as more of a loving, thoughtful tribute to 16-bit/32-bit 2D platformers in general rather than just a better version of *one* of those classic franchises. And if you did that sort of stuff, then go right ahead and check it out. It's a lot of fun!  (PLEASE NOTE: If you're a Mac user, as of 20th June 2015, I recommend you turn off Steam Overlay before playing this game. There's a weird bug right now that doesn't let the visuals show up that's all to do with Steam Overlay for some reason. I'm sure its a bug that'll be fixed in time but for now, bare that in mind before you play. Thanks!)  EDIT: Just after writing this review, I found out that at some point in the game, it gets VERY suddenly hard really, really quickly so unfortunately for players who aren't immediately fantastic at tough-as-nails platformers, then your enjoyment of the game will only take you to the 3rd stage or so before you hit a mental wall.   So I don't readily recommend this game to as many people as I did before now, but its at least worth a try.",

First of all, by just looking at the trailer or a screenshot, you can tell   this game looks gorgeous  : it has one of the most detailed pixel art graphics I've ever seen and the music is amazing. I found the story interesting for a 2D game and playing as the different characters you get to see the story in their perspective (  slightly  ). And the voice acting is pretty neat, again, for a 2D game.  Everybody compares this to sonic but when you play it; you realize how different and unique this game is. There’s a variety of stages with creative gimmicks and   the characters have really original abilities   but you can try this by yourself by   playing the demo  .  Unlike sonic, the game tells you about the danger ahead,   enemies don’t damage you by touching them   only their attacks,   only 2 stages have bottomless pits  , you can’t really get crushed so   there’s no cheap deaths here  . The stages are long but they never feel boring and they contain a lot of secrets with their respective bosses and mid-bosses. It’s more combat-focused since every character has a big range of attacks; that’s why   the bosses and the action sequences are the best part of the game  .    I really don’t see any bad thing in this game  , pointing out minor details would sound very forced. Maybe there’s a lack of information on the characters moves since it looks like the characters have an specific list of moves and attacks but they have much more than what you would think (  I guess it’s fun to find out by yourself  ).  Anyways, I would say this game is   epic   and that’s a word I rarely use. ",

I can honestly say, that this game is one of the best games i have ever played. Let me explain: Pros + Every map is unique. Ff exampe, one map has magic rings to buff up your special attacks which makes it speedrunner map, while another map is filled with hidden cards which are needed to pass through blocked doors. + Every map has its own unique enemies: From little robotic bazookas to turrets which automaticaly aim at you in any foreshortening and fires non stop to kill (like a darn tf2 sentry). + A lot of unforgettable bosses! And what amazes me, i did not meet any similar attacks from each other except shooting.  + Magnificent Characters. Every character playstyle is a big difference. I will put them in order:     Lilac the Dragon has a special ability to dash through all enemy blockades and has Super-Smash-Bros-like fighting techniques.     Carol The Cat is a complex character and she is for neat players. Her attacks is not as powerful as Lilac's, but she can get to places where is hard to get in as Lilac. She attacks as fast as you hit the button. Also she has an ability to jump on walls. Now she might look a difficult character for SOME bosses and easy for other. If you do not like her slow spped, you have to find gasouline. As she get them she picks up `HOLY   BADASS  ! MOTORCYCLE!    Milla The Dog (curiously enough not a rabbit) can use shield, blast shield in front of enemies, throw her magical plasma cube, fly like Tailes and dig the earth for getting good stuff (do not put Minecraft joke here). Also she is a greate helper entire game as NPC.  As addition, friendly NPCs are very useful in boss fights (only places they appear except one map). Not worse than Elizabeth from Bioshoch infinite. + Design. I am speechless here. You won't forget any of these characters! + Story is enjoyable and is put very good. Some scenes look peaceful, some are BRUTAL AND DRAMATIC. + Good humour. Mayor Zao always has a good jokes in any situations. + Game is full of suprises. Try to shuffle character select menu or make up 4 save files of Lilac... you won't regret it. + Voice acting is pretty well done, even if it is not professional. Big thanks to voice actors! + AMAZING SOUNDTRACK! ? 5 songs at least are enjoyable + Secrets. There's no retro game that has no secret items to collect. + Mahjong  ? No co-op mode. I do not know is it needed here.  - Some levels are not fully balanced for some characters.  - Millia doesn't have a story line right now (only no story classic mode). - Future update is longing for a year already.  I recommend to buy this game. Game is still get updates so why not try out its demo right now?",

Carol can ride around on a motorcycle and Milla throws blocks and has a shield. I think anyone can enjoy this game, even those that do not usually like platformers.

(my first sonic game was sonic heroes.)so this is from the view of a gamer who isn't 'nostalgia blind' from my younger years.(CAN SOMEONE MAKE A 3D PLATFORMER BASED AROUND SPYRO?HAT IN TIME IS BASED MORE IN MARIO 64 THAN ANYTHING ELSE!)  So what is my opinion on freedom planet? I love it,i love it,I LOVE IT.  The controls i've never had a problem with,they're fluid and responsive.the levels work brilliantly with the speed aspect much like the early sonic games.(which freedom planet is a throwback to)  The story is ok,a little cheesey in places but gets the job done.  The characters are well done each with their own playstyle(i'm a carol guy myself.)and their own point of view in the story,uping the replay value.  The soundtrack is one of the best i've heard.(special mention going to fortune night part one)and the pixel art is amazing.So much so this is the first game soundtrack i've bought.check my mini review there if you like.  on top of that it's out for the Wii U RIGHT NOW!  after coming back down to the (freedom)planet's surface,i have to give freedom planet a 9/10 with a dark wolf seal of epicness.  if you're still not sure,then there's a demo to try before you buy.  a brillient game for both retro and modern gamers alike. if you want a great platformer with characters you'll love.  get freedom planet.     -ace the dark wolf",

A must-buy if you're old enough to have fond Sonic memories.  The three playable characters also play radically differently - Lilac has a Sparkster-style charge attack that lets her cover big distances of open space quickly and a double jump that doubles as a slow descent AND an attack, her cat sidekick can climb walls indefinitely and has a strong attack that's easy to aim, making her the most conventional character and the easiest to get into altough she can't enter all alternate routes. Finally, Milla the rabbit can conjure blocks, reflect enemy attacks and fly, but has half the health of the other two girls, making her an advanced character that is really tricky to master but potentially the best to speedrun with.  I'm just at the 3rd stage so far, but I can recommend this game considerably - it might just be as good as Shovel Knight if it keeps this up!",

            "review_text": "Ill get it out of the way, this game is very “Sonic” In character design and level design. That’s where the similarities end though, Freedom Planet is a very different beast and really deserves to be judged on its own merits. Freedom Planet is more a action game then a speedy platformer. Sure there are parts where you will be booking it through loop-de-loops but it blends combat in with it seamlessly and the levels lend themselves well to it. See most enemies don’t hurt you on contact, so you have two options. Blaze through the level and hit the occasional enemy on the way or stick around and fight it out. Both options are fine and both have there rewards and the game gives you everything you need to do it.  From the offset the game has three characters to play and all of them play drastically different. There’s Lilac who is more well rounded and great for first time players, Carol who can really kick ♥♥♥ with skillful play and Milla who is meant to be played slowly and more carefully and is really built for exploring the levels and finding shiny things. All of these characters are viable in all the different levels and they even each have there own levels unique to them. Each character is like playing a different game and most of the levels are balanced so every character has there own way of getting around them. There are even areas that only certain characters can access. It can be very difficult to build levels with multiple characters in mind and they have done a great job of it.  I will say some of the bosses can take a while to really get a bead on however the game pretty much lets you try again as much as you want until you finally get it right and that moment when you do can really be satisfying. The game does use a lives system but with how the continues work its really just kind of window dressing which is a bit of a oversight but it didn’t bother me too much. Though that makes going for the games main collectible Crystals kind of moot since all it really does is give you lives unless you care about high scores or bragging rights. I do really wish they could have reworked it cause the idea of doing away with lives period wouldn’t hurt me in the slightest. The reason I stuck with it til the end was because I DIDN’T have to start a level over, I actually had a chance to learn instead of drop the game out of frustration. Lives are a product of the times, when the games were all about eating quarters. I feel like lives are a outdated relic of the past and its just not good game design anymore, hardcore gamers be damned, but really its just a small nitpick on a otherwise great game.  I do want to end on a positive note though. I’m proud this game opted to have not one, not two but THREE female protagonists who are fun and interesting. I will say that while the story itself is pretty good its not super spectacular, But I do like how you get different pieces of the story depending on who you play and it does add good replay value. The characters are what really saved it for me. The writing is fun and the voice acting is also well done for having a lot of unknown actors. Having three female protagonists is really a breath of fresh air in a game industry ruled by scruffy white guys.   I highly recommend Freedom Planet especially if you’ve been craving a Sonic styled platformer like the good old days that feels like a long lost Saturn game. They plan on adding more content for free later including 2 new characters with there own parts of the story to play which frankly im very excited for. Give this game a look.",

In a sea of '8-bit' games, Freedom Planet dares to throw in all that was great about owning a SEGA Genesis into the new millenium. The game invokes not just Sonic the Hedgehog, like people would expect, but also titles like 'Rocket Knight Adventures.' Each of the currently three playable characters play unique to each other and are fun in their own rights. My only complaint right now is that the adventure mode is rather samey for each of the characters. My favorite story is Lilacs, but I feel after you beat hers, you hardly have to play either of the others. Carol, maybe. Milla's came out recently, and while I loved playing her character, the way they handled her story was disappointing. I was expecting to get a new perspective on the game's story, but instead I got some possibilities squandered and others outright ignored. Don't be fooled, her story does not follow the other two. While it does tread its own path, it does so while sticking too close to the originals.  Regardless of storyline hiccups, I found the game itself to be wonderful, and the characters endearing. The game gets infuriatingly hard, but in a good way. If you want to play a 16-bit styled platform, this is the game for you.",

The characters are fun to play as, the level design is excellent and the bosses are really exciting (except for that stupid dragon). If you're in it for the gameplay, I definitely recommend this game. However, I have one gripe with the gameplay. The traction is insane. You can walk up walls or jump into a slanted ceiling and start running up. If the traction was a bit more sane, the gameplay would have no flaws at all.  Now on to non-gameplay related stuff. The music is really great, I love it. However, the voices were really grating. I hated them. Another thing I hate is the story. Normally, I wouldn't talk about the story on a Sonic-style platformer, but they clearly went out of their way for it, with a fully voiced story mode full of cutscenes (thankfully completely skippable by playing Classic mode). The characters are pretty awful, and I don't care much for their designs. Their personalities is where it really hurts though, as they're all pretty boring and annoying. If the cast was more interesting, perhaps I could have been more invested in the story. Also, the cutscenes are absurdly long for this kind of game. They should be much more concise and short. As I said earlier, the voiceacting really annoyed me, so that didn't help.  This next problem is a bit more important I think; The game can't seem to decide if that one city is using a Chinese or Japanese setting. It's an unholy mix of both, and it was really annoying me. Choose one and stick with it, make different places for both, or just make something new.  All in all, I recommend it, but only if you're in it for semi-solid Sonic-like gameplay and nothing else.",

            "review_text": "Despite dozens of games and a legacy spanning decades, Sonic The Hedgehog’s popularity has always puzzled me immensely. He’s one of gaming’s most iconic characters (whose fan devotion can take on an almost religious feeling in some circles), a cultural icon, and still the stalwart face of Sega so many years later. Yet, I’ve never been able to understand how he became that, and continue to be so incredibly popular even today.  His recent offerings have been almost unanimously panned, fans reminiscing about the good ‘ol days of the Sega Genesis, and yet going back to those original games I become even more confused. The controls feel loose, the level designs seem to work against the mechanics, and everything feels like it’s almost intentionally undercooked so as to keep the spotlight on its lead. I’ve tried for years, dipping into nearly every “golden era” Sonic game repeatedly, and have always come away unimpressed and confused as to what it is I’m not seeing that everyone else is. Is it just nostalgia? I’d like to think not.  At this point you may be wondering if I’ve accidentally published the wrong review, but I feel it important to talk about my feelings toward Sonic before I can discuss Freedom Planet. I try to stay away from relying on direct comparisons between games in my reviews, but Freedom Planet is such a direct response to the cries of Sonic fans for Sega to bring him back to the 16-bit era that it would be almost disingenuous not to mention how it relates. It’s also important because it’s the first time I’ve been able to see what it is about this formula that people love, and for a moment make me sad it’s been underserved for so long.  It’s in the way the game moves, speedily and in every direction, characters zipping through loop-de-loops and scaling walls, all while cheekily shrugging it off as no big deal. The way level designs build upon themselves provides a sense of discovery whether you bounce up onto a hidden ledge, or miss a jump and fall within a secret passage. Momentum is built into the levels themselves, and watching it all fly past at a speed you can barely keep up with is intense and delightful. Give it a brilliant chiptune soundtrack and it’s an easy task getting in the zone and forgetting about the minimal input required to get through many levels.  It was a wonderful handful of stages, but then I hit upon the same thing that had turned me off Sonic in the past, and by extension was now eating away at my enjoyment of Freedom Planet. In a consistently tragic fashion, Freedom Planet’s level designs begin a war with its mechanics. It’s a game best served going as fast as possible, and yet after the first few levels it insists on slowing you down constantly, whether to fight enemies, solve tedious puzzles, or retrace your steps to find keycards and the doors they go in. As soon as Freedom Planet slowed down the moment was broken, and I began to aggravatingly fiddle with the slippering platforming controls and awkward attacks.  In any other game this sort of self destruction would be disappointing, but in this case it’s doubly so because it’s the same problem Sonic has suffered from for so long. Even when he’s not the star, it would seem his problems follow anyway, in an almost poetic commitment to making a game that as closely mirrors its inspiration as possible, for better or worse.  This happens again in a less disastrous, almost amusing way, with how Freedom Planet has adopted not only Sonic’s mechanical design but also its narrative aesthetic that has become overly present in more recent games. There’s an inordinate amount of exposition in Freedom Planet, all of it overdone and melodramatic, stretching a convoluted plot across a needlessly large cast that mostly exist for the sake of boss fights. It’s not that the story is bad though that gets me, it’s that it’s a Sonic story with new faces. The writing has the same self indulgent elongation and fabricated self awareness that reads like a rejected cartoon, though at least unlike Sonic the voice acting is shockingly almost competent. I’m not ashamed to admit at times I was almost on board with its nonsense, for which the voice work is solely responsible.  None of this makes the story good, but in this context it’s at least understandable? Maybe expected, even. Where Freedom Planet’s mechanics made me sad with how true they stayed to form, I couldn’t help but just be amused that developer GalaxyTrail had managed to copy the Sonic everyone would like to forget, and merge it with the one everyone but myself loves. It sort of makes me hate myself for not being able to enjoy Sonic and its contemporaries, because Freedom Planet clearly loves the franchise immensely and does its best to carry the torch Sega dropped some time ago.  Whether it’s a torch worth picking up again will probably depend entirely on how you feel about Sonic, and how much you want to revisit his Genesis days in a new form. In that sense it was probably predetermined that Freedom Planet was never going to be my thing. I wanted it to, like I wanted every Sonic game I struggled through to be, but its problems are impossible for me to look beyond. I can only assume they aren’t seen as issues in many people’s eyes, but I can only speak for myself, and continue wondering why I feel like the only one stuck on the outside looking in at all the fun others are having.

With new mechanics introduced in every level, along with brand new enemies with few repeats, the game continues to amaze to the end. The story beats any of sonic's stories in any of his games with better voice acting and more cohesiveness than anything sonic ever starred in.

If you’re going to pass this game up because “furries” then you’re doing yourself a grave disservice.  The story is shockingly captivating right from the opening sequence and despite having zero bloodshed through the game, stuff gets surprisingly dark from the opening cinematic. Plenty of moments where I found myself saying “HOLY ♥♥♥♥!”. This story is not a masterpiece by any sense. Its not going to change how storytelling is done in games. The characters aren’t the deepest things in the world (but you won’t hate them. In fact, you might find one you attach to) and the writing isn’t going to be winning any awards, but God damn, its enjoyable for what it is! Just don’t go in expecting something mind-blowing or profound.  The gameplay for me, is a mixed bag. I like platformers, but sometimes the jumping control doesn’t want to work with me. When I’m gaining speed, about to jump off the edge, sometimes I don’t jump. I heard that its because if you holding somewhat up you end up making the game think you’re doing the look up animation. This has lead to a handful of deaths. I hope it gets looked into an hammered out. I had to adjust my habits and go through the levels at a slower pace to prevent myself from going to my death via that animation thing.  I had beaten the game on Normal, so keep that in mind during the following. HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME DOESN’T ♥♥♥♥ AROUND! Mercy invincibility seems really short or doesn’t exist at all! I had found myself mobbed by enemies just trying to run from them, two or more people shoot me, and then my health bar is gone before I know it! This game is not shy about murdering you constantly. The levels have shades of either “oh, okay”, to “this is cool” and “what evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/♥♥♥♥♥ designed this!?”.  The bosses are the right mix of frustrating and awesome...most of them. At least two of them strike me as “that one boss” and would loathe to fight anymore, while most I would gladly fight again. The final boss fight does stack up and is brutal (just like a final boss should be) and I felt awesome for wrecking them.  Just fix the jump issues and give us a BIT MORE mercy invincibility. My only gripes on an otherwise well made game that I would play again and again.",

            "review_text": "Hey, kids! Do you remember the good old days when Sonic the Hedgehog was fast, cool, and fun to play, with great music, tight level design, and amazing controls?  Well, since Sega couldn't be bothered, someone else decided to give you a brand new Sonic game. Freedom Planet is a 2-d sprite based game that pays massive tribute to the old Sonic the Hedgehog games on the Genesis, HOWEVER, it is, in my opinion, even better than those old classics.  First, the graphics. Beautiful sprite work, with tons of expressive characters who can laugh, cry, hug, tease, hang out and watch a movie...the graphics are amazing, with a mix of polygon esque sprites and traditional hand drawn images.  Gameplay is tight and works well, with three different characters who all move fast, but all have different specials. Lilac is my favorite, who has a double jump and a charge move for massive damage. The speed is great here and the platforming even better. There's lots of unique and organic level design that is just awesome.  Music. Excellent in almost all regards. Very power rocking but also somber at times, with a lot of variety. Better yet is the timing and the sound effects, used for dramatic effect and comedy all in one package.  Story...wait, story? Yeah, unlike the early Sonic games, Freedom Planet has an impressive story mode to go along with the classic arcade mode. It's got tons of great humor, likable characters, and some truly gut wrenching moments here and there...showing just how powerful sprite art can really be. The entire game is voice acted too and while some consider these actors unknown, they rival the best VAs I've ever heard in film or anime. Able to emote and carry a story with the force of their voices mixed with the sprites on screen.  Freedom Planet is the total package. It's beautiful to look at, it's got great music and gameplay, and a story that is, honestly, shocking in how engaging and powerful it is, as well as fun.  Now, no game is perfect, however. The levels go on for just a tad too long and while I had plenty of lives up to the end of the game, the final boss is pretty cheap. Still, that aside, the developers give you infinite continues and lots of check points, so it never gets too frustrating.  This game is amazing...please, support these devs. I'd love to see a sequel.",

Freedom Planet is of the latter variety, as it certainly feels a bit like a Sonic-style game, but has enough of it's own mix of platforming, melee fighting, and amazing level design to differentiate it from Sonic entirely. In fact, long-time Sega fans may compare many things to a bunch of classic games such as Gunstar Heroes, Ristar, and Rocket Knight Adventures.  Comparisons aside, this game is colorful, charming, and overall just fun to play. The bosses can be slightly challenging the first time around, but they are all about learning their patterns. With three distinctly different characters to play (with two more on the way), multiple difficulty settings, and a very late 90's/early 2000's style story mode, this game is more than just a retro indie game that uses elements of anotehr well-known franchise.

The gameplay is pretty solid and fun, but even if you make a mistake or choose a wrong path there's plenty of things for you to explore and discover. The music is awesome, not much for me to say about it other than it was so good that I would have the character stay still just to listen to it on occasion (also considering to buy the soundtrack ;) ). The visuals were very well done, especially near the end of the game where you see characters and stuff interacting with eachother in the background as you progress. One thing that bothered me about that though was that I would get confused of the backgrounds in some of the levels as they would blend into the platforms as it would sometimes give the illusion of a wall being there or my character isn't moving. Didn't happen much, but annoyed me a little at times.   I played as Lilac first as she's the first character you get to choose and it was pretty darn fun. From the looks of most of it and I can't say for sure (so I'll update this later) but it seems like the stories don't change much with diffrent characters so I would just have to watch the same cutscene I watched with Lilac. One final thing I need to say is, the voice acting. Lol is the best way to put it, but putting consideration of what the designers had to do to get this game going I cant say much, but, as my friend said, 'It's Arc Rise all over again'. The voice acting isn't terrible and it ain't aming for an oscar or anything, but I simply said 'It's funny-bad'. Of course it's not that bad to bomb its rating I'm about to give it as the gameplay defines this game alot better and the animation during the cutscenes are full of life and had alot of work put into it. On a side note, you get to choose the classic mode option to play the game without story so there's that. Soooo this game gets a 9.3/10 from me. In 10 years or so this game would be an old time classic to me and I'd play it with a goofy looking smile on my face enjoying sweet 2d-platforming-highspeed goodness.",

        {
            "review_text": "One of my favorite games of all time is Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles. This game was built up to be a spiritual successor to it. It's not.  Although each character has different abilities in how they can traverse the level, this never really comes into play as the levels hardly deviate. Sure, you can get to tiny different sections of the level but all this amounts to is picking up a few gems before the path reconnects. On the topic of gems, collecting 200 gives you a 1-up, much like the typical 100 for a 1-up in classic platformers of yesteryear. The problem is that not only are there too many too close together (there's typically groups on the screen of 15 every few seconds) but getting hit doesn't cause you to drop them so you rack up extra lives very quickly. Playing casually on the default difficulty, I had 25 lives at the end of level 4.  Unlike Sonic, the game puts a heavy emphasis on combat. This works on the weak enemies that scatter the levels but when it comes to boss fights, the game falls flat. Bosses are damage sponges and seem to have random levels of health. The first boss takes 3 hits, the second seems to take anywhere between 3 and 5 'damage phases', the third takes so many hits that it's hard to tell exactly how much damage it takes in total (likely 80+ hits, lowballing) before dying. There's seemingly no pattern and boss fights devolve into mashing attack close to the boss and then running away. It feels really slow and clunky and is honestly dissatisfying. Going back to the topic of regular enemies, fighting them is literally a waste of time. For the most part, they don't deal contact damage so you can run right past them, and they either drop nothing (in the case of small enemies), a few gems (which, as stated before, are so common it's unfunny), or a 'core' which is used to roll a die in a end-of-level bonus game in which you can earn a shield or 1-ups (which you'll have plenty of through casual play anyways) so for the most part, they might as well not even exist. They also inhabit seemingly random sections of the level, with level 3 being a particularly egregious example with streetlight-looking enemies being found in literal dead ends or high up in the sky where you'll rarely be.  While I'm on the topic of levels, it seems like when they were being designed, the scenery was drawn first and then the level was made around that as opposed to the other way around. As beautiful as the levels look, I can't help but be confused by the world's design, with buildings that are cut off halfway by a large pillar and odd, curving geometry on the bottom of platforms. Additionally, since one of the characters' ability is to go up walls, there will often be upside-down 'staircases' on the undersides of a lot of platforms that prevents you from climbing up them, which gets frustrating when you're exploring the level and looking for hidden cards. I love scouring games for hidden secrets, but it feels like Freedom Planet incorporated the 10 cards per level fairly poorly and as a last-minute thing. They're often in random spots that require you to backtrack a bit, in a random spot that you have to detour for, or hidden up high in a tiny nook. Not only this, but when you pick them up, they're often labeled in the wrong order, so you'll pick up card No. 2 early in the level and think you missed the first card and backtrack and search high up in the level, and go all around the different elevations of the level to try and find it, only to give up and move on, find another card, and be told that this card is No. 1. Searching for these cards easily quintuples the amount of time you can spend on a stage and making the game feel more like Metroid or Symphony of the Night, which is fine and all but not exactly fitting for a Sonic-inspired game.  There's a few flaws in how the game handles physics. For one, the concept of momentum is obnoxious in this game. Going down slopes builds speed fairly quickly as expected, but as soon as you start to head upwards at any angle, your speed drops like a stone from a dash to a jog. Like in Sonic, there's springs in this game, but the wall-mounted ones are far too 'weak'. Since you'll naturally be holding the control stick in their direction to be launched by them, there'll end up being a few frames where you're holding the control stick in the direction opposite of where you're being launched from. During those few frames, you'll 'skid' and lose roughly 40% or so of the momentum you would've had. Not touching the control stick has the same effect and no momentum is maintained. Furthermore, for whatever reason you can literally walk up inclines and walls with no repercussions (unless it's a very high vertical structure in which case you'll slow down very slowly and promptly fall back down) and can often continue to move to slopes on the ceiling and walk upside down. And when I say walk, I mean literally walking. Things also seemingly cease to exist once they're off the screen, causing things like a string of bombs to stop detonating halfway through and gems dropped by enemies that fall offscreen to technically be 'floating' in that if you jump past them, head down, then under them, they'll then continue to fall.  My biggest complaint was the poor voice acting and abundance of story in the adventure mode. Some of the lines are cringey and a lot of the time they're unnecessary exposition. The voice acting ranges from average to high school project-levels of bad. I actually got so fed up with it, I had to download a mod that essentially muted the voice lines in the cutscenes. Speaking of cutscenes, there are a lot of them. I like to think myself a quick reader, and even then I found cutscenes surpassing the 5 and 6 minute mark between levels with unnecessary elements (watching the main characters watch TV, watching them eating dinner with a provincial mayor, brooding). The amount of plot and backstory makes it seem like the game wants to be an RPG and not a platformer. Going back to Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles again, off the top of my head the longest 'cutscene' with plot in it is around 45 seconds, during which you have full control of your character. Personally, I don't need or really want a rich full backstory of the game's world's lore when the focus of the game is going fast. The game does offer a 'classic mode' that removes most cutscenes from the game, but then I'm left wondering why I'm doing what I'm doing and how I got from the previous level to the current one. In S3&amp;K, there was a brief cutscene at the end of each level that showed how it connected to the next level. I shouldn't be punished by not knowing the story by simply wanting to not wade through unnecessary pages of dialogue.  What I will give this game, though, are its visuals. The game is visually reminiscent of Ristar for Genesis or Knuckles Chaotix on the 32x and it's simply gorgeous. Even some of the character designs are reminiscent of characters from Ristar. Most of the character designs are decent and original (even if Lilac is obviously hedgehog-esque) and there's a lot of extra frames making animations smooth and pretty. Backgrounds and levels have a heavy Chinese/Mongolian theme to them and while it's not exactly my taste, it's aesthetically sound. Musically, it's fairly good too, even if the Oriental-themed tracks don't do much for me and I find them a bit forgettable but they do their job of being decent background music that fits the mood.   Frankly, the game is spectacular...if you can seperate it from its inspiration and spiritual forerunner. If you can overlook the miles of dialogue with poor voice acting, strange level design, odd combat, and weird physics, it might be worth picking it up when it's on sale. Otherwise, I'd give it a pass.",

Running through the huge worlds while looking at one of the best pixel art is amazing. Collecting stuff is fun, the combat feels nice and the stages are great. Only the stages, though.   This game has one of the cringiest cutscenes and voice acting i've ever seen. Heck, Sonic Adventure had better cutscenes, a game that came out 15 years ago! one cutscene you're looking at 3 girls.. eating food. the other cutscene the game tries to pull out some unnecessary edgy stuff.  And then theres the last 3 levels unlike the other, great stages you will HATE these ones if you're the explorative type.I would rather get rewarded for my exploring not punished, thank you.  *Sigh* now let's talk about the ♥♥♥♥ing bosses.Every single boss has that 1 bs move that will keep hitting you and you will not have a chance to react since the lack of invincibility frames in this game.The game expects you to master these bosses or it will make sure your life count stays below 5 and im only playing on 'normal mode'. this game gets very repetitive with bosses near end-game, i'm talking 5 bosses back to back, people and every single one of them is frustrating and it ruins my final thoughts about the game, which is sad because i really like the first 5 levels in this game i think they're the most fun platforming levels ever!  So overall freedom planet is a great platforming experience but it's completely ruined by the cringey voice acting and terrible, frustrating, trial and error boss fights.  So if you get this game, do yourself a favour and play this on classic, easy/casual mode and avoid all the bad things it does Look the things it does right are amazing but the things it does wrong unfortunately got to the point of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.

There's also three different characters you can play as and they play differently. The devs clearly put in a lot of time and effort on this game.  Now to the bad stuff. The bosses are too hard, and bad part is they're hard for cheap reasons. This is tied into the the character field of view being too close the character. If the camera was pulled back a bit, a lot of the frustration of the bosses would be removed since there are many instances of attacks coming from off-screen blindsiding your character. I'm not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at games but from the halfway point on, some of these bosses aren't even coming down to memorization, just a matter if I'm getting lucky with not getting hit by some off-screen projectile at various points of the fight. The close-in camera also makes navigating the large levels not as fun as it should be. This leads into my next point.  Levels are also too large. I know a lot of people will disagree with this but the stages just go on and on and by the time I get to the third or fourth screen of them, I'm more than ready for them to be over. Pathfinding is also a bit of an issue since there are times when you have to go what appears to be backward to go forward. I do give the devs credit for making the levels multi-tiered but they took it to far.  The story is bad and the voicework/audio recording is very inconsistent. I normally wouldn't care about this in this sort of game since the gameplay is the thing that matters but there is a ton of story bits going on in Freedom Planet. Your character also has audio cues every time they jump/attack/whatever and it can be annoying since you can't turn it off. Unless you read or wrote Sonic fan-fiction at some point, you'll probably want to play the game on classic mode, which from my understanding, skips the story bits.  In short, a game with great animation but unless you're really down with hard, cheap bosses, you'll probably play the game and enjoy it enough until you hit a frustrating road block and just put the game aside. It's not that the game is hard, I've played and beaten a lot of hard games, it's just that the hardness feels like it stems more from poor design in the later portions than a true sense of difficulty. That said, if you're into hard 2-D games, you're likely to have a good time with Freedom Planet.",

This game plays like controlling Amy in Sonic advance 1 and the only physics ♥♥♥♥ up I found myself in repeatedly was walking up walls at relatively low speeds. Momentum works, but the amount of momentum required to run on the god damn ceiling is too little. Also, this game is not winning any rewards in creativity, it started development as a fangame and it shows because the plot feels like it was at one point about the black arms taking the master emerald while Blaze, Marine, and Cream had to stop it. I know I'm not the only one who feels that way but it's easily negligable simply by playing in classic mode rather than adventure. The plot itself also has poor pacing (much like this review) since one moment you can beat a level, get a ~1 minute cut-scene before the next level, and then after that level you get 20 minutes of plot before the next level. I recommend this game on sale, but it's not worth 15 bucks unless you really want every achivement or are willing to do a playthrough as all three characters.",

            "review_text": "What was once a derivative Sonic the Hedgehog fangame where the main character was a hedgehog has now blossomed into a love letter to the 16-bit era of gaming and the surge soda-fueled excitement of 90's culture in general. It's an action-platformer that grabs inspiration from Sonic, Mega Man X, Pulseman, Gunstar Heroes, and even space ship shoot 'em up games like Thunder Force for good measure, and it's a beastly game in its own right. It sports colorful vibrant visuals, a funky soundtrack, and tight varied gameplay which takes advantage of the unique abilities of (as of now) three playable characters and the myriad of obstacles, enemies and tough bosses that they face. The main protagonist Lilac for example can do a spinning-top maneuver to be used as a double jump in addition to dealing multiple hits, while Karol can roll down hills and climb up walls. Milla can materialize blocks, do a Yoshi-style flutter jump and shield to block hits, which should give you an idea of the variety in playstyle that you can employ to exhaust its robust replay value.  Though it is a retro-style game first and foremost, it also boasts a trapping of modern games- fully voice acted dialogue. While shockingly well-acted considering this is an indie game (I gotta give special props to Dawn Bennett and Xander Barriga, the voices of Lilac and Lord Brevon respectively), it's a prominent element in a story that is, quite frankly, a mess.   First of all though the presentation of the story is great, as the sprite animations are lovely and some places (like Lilac's treehouse and Torque's tent) were specially made just for the cutscenes and they're detailed visual elements that are fun to look at. The basic premise is that an evil intergalactic warlord called Lord Brevon attacks a planet called Avalice and sows discontent and conflict between its three resident kingdoms in an attempt to secure the Kingdom Stone, an artifact that could make him unstoppable by doubling the size of his army... somehow. Lilac the dragon, Karol the Wildcat, and later Torque... the alien? and Milla the... basset hound are cast into an adventure to stop him. Though this sounds reasonable enough by itself, the story is plagued with inconsistencies and tonal problems. The intro cutscene shows Brevon decapitating the emperor of one of the kingdoms in front of his son, which is then followed in the main game by useless dialogue of Lilac and her friends talking about cooties. The whole game follows this line, with themes of loyalty, subversion, diplomacy and even ultimatum interspersed with awkward attempts at comic relief and character interactions that go nowhere. It definitely gets my credit for trying because of the splendid presentation and the (mostly) great voice acting, and there are a couple moments in the story near the end that I liked, but overall the big problems soured my taste, and it outright failed to truly garner my vested interest in the goings on of the world and its characters. It's nice that developer GalaxyTrail provided the option of playing the game in 'Classic' mode, which removes the cutscenes between levels altogether, so you can ignore the story entirely if you wish.   Gameplay problems are few and far between, as it is overall an absolute blast (especially the intense boss fights), though I REALLY wish that the special meter Lilac uses to dragon boost could fill up faster, or another option could be present for the player to make it fill up faster besides collecting the blue crystals. I despise the moments where I had to wait for it to refill before I could ascend that ledge the most out of everything else in my playing experience.   Thankfully, lackluster story and characters aside, the gaming experience is what truly matters and that in my humble opinion is a resounding success. If you had any passing interest in the platformers and action games of the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo, I can't recommend this game highly enough.  ",

If you've never played old skool 2D Sonic and wanna see what the fuss was all about, you will ♥♥♥♥ing love this!  If you like things, you will ♥♥♥♥ing love this!

It has lots of replayability and you will need to play each stage several times to collect the hidden cards and don't even say you won't coz you know you have like 100 steam badges coz you love dat ♥♥♥♥! The music is retro awesome but not chip music, its like Sonic CD music, just how sir likes it. The gameplay has a really nice balance between stage exploration and burning through as fast as you can. It's hard too, like I died 57 times on normal hard, but it never feels cheap or unbeatable. It just feels like the game goes 'Im a level boss so I'm gonna act like one now bend over!'

Lilac is the most like Sonic (You'll be hearing 'Cyclone' every five seconds), Carol is more combat oriented (with a Wario bike), and Milla is a slower, defensive platformer (not puzzle-platforming no matter what PauseBreakReviews says). The story is long and cringe-worthy at times with inconsistencies and cutscenes can go on for more than 15 minutes at times, but levels are fun and bosses are fun. Bosses are more like Mega Man because they take many tries to get the pattern down, so it strays from Sonic. I originally played the game all the way through before actually buying it on Steam, hence the short play time.

Freedom Planet utilizes beautiful Sega Genesis 32 Bit sprites, all of which looks BEAUTIFUL and well detailed. the game consists of a fairly easy game controls and yes it is compatable with a Keyboard! and I've mastered it quite well. the game is fun and challanging in terms of puzzle solving, while there are some tough spots the game is fair even after you loose all of your lives you still have a fair set of continues. so incase you need more shots at Braven or that infernal Dragon, you have'll have some more tries even after Poor Lilac and Carol are killed (some in rather horrific ways if you think about it). OH! the game also has the most epic, Kick-♥♥♥ Soundtrack you'd ever heard and well worth buying as DLC. trust me you'll be jamming to it even in your sleep!... which... I have....  Now let's get down to the characters. each one has their own flavor and personality. and from what I understand they have some history to them. I wonder if there is ever gonna be a backstory comic later on?  Carol: a wildcat that I can't say I've played yet, but she has her own fair move set from what I can see in the videos. she even has a motorcycle that YES can drive up walls and on cealings! I KNOW RIGHT! HOW COOL IS THAT!?   Milla: a rather cute Basset Hound. she is introduced early in the game. where she lacks in melee attacks she makes up for in mid ranged attacks with these green blob blocks and a shield. and each one can fire a short ranged blast.  Lilac: A Dragon who is yes our main character and I will admit my favorite! she has the best move set that's fun to play. as I recall She was originally gonna be a Hedgehog but was changed to be a dragon. A very wise choise In my opinion. and was the best thing they could do. while the game was originally going to be a sonic fangame, they decided to make it their own thing (though they've kept most of the style form what I can see). whoever decided to make Lilac a Dragon instead of a hedgehog is the wisest man or woman ever!   each character has their own move set and animations. when left idle they will do things. given enough time they will speak wanting you to get back to the game. though I'm unsure how far this goes. there is alot of content as well. card pick ups for the gallary that includes soundtracks, concept art, and dialog to name a few.  In Closing, I urge, No I DEMAND You get this game, it is the BEST 2D Retro inspired game! infact I will even say this is what Retro Game develoupers should strive. I hope this game grows in popularity, and maybe we might see a sequel! it may have started out as a sonic fangame, but I think it grew into a beast all it's own!",

The game is beautiful and makes the best out of the 32 bits pixel art. The voices are properly dubbed, which adds a nice touch to the experience. This is especially true considering that the story mode has a whole plot that is fully animated and that doesn't skip important parts. The team really worked a lot on this project and the finish touch is there. About the gameplay, it's a good old sonic-like game with lot of mechanics. In fact, the feeling is so similar to sonic that I was at the beginning frustrated to no be able to run as fast as in a sonic game. And the loss of speed right after a jumper is also somewhat annoying. But it's a small matter compared to all the moves you can do. And since you have 3 playable characters, you can replay the game 3 times with a different style of gameplay (but it's not *that* different). The musics are quite good too. Not epic but definitely adequate to the sonic 2d era and pleasant to hear. Too bad I couldn't change the volume of the sounds. About longevity, you'll have a whole day to play for your first run (progression is saved and you can continue from last savepoint). For such kind of game where you run at full speed through the levels, that's really a lot. And the best is that's not repetitive. There are really a lot of various contents. And concerning the difficulty, I find it well balanced and progressing nicely with the player. Bosses are maybe a bit too challenging, especially the last ones, but the infinite continues makes sure that you'll eventually beat the game. Once you finished the game with lilac, you can replay it with two other characters and with new powers, which is appreciable. A timer and a classic mode (no story) is also there for those who want to speedrun the game, which is nice too.  If you miss the old sonic games from genesis megadrive, or if you liked Dust, you really should play this game. It regularly in sales, but I feel it is worth the whole price too.

Much like Shovel Knight, this game is a throwback to all the kickass platformers back in the simpler days that focused more on high-speed fun and enjoyable level design that keeps you wanting to play, rather than the modern day stuff where developers find what sells the most and rehash it until the once perky mounds of enjoyment become saggy and undesirable. Whereas Shovel Knight catered more to the Nintendo side of the old days, Freedom Planet caters more to the SEGA side of things, and I love it for that.  The controls are tight and responsive, the visuals are amazing and unlike most other throwback indie games, don't rely on pseudo 8-bit to give a feeling of nostalgia, the sound effects and music are spot on and really drive the sense of atmosphere home, the voice acting (yes there is voice acting in this) is especially good despite the small development team, and though the story may seem a bit...basic and random, it develops the characters quite nicely and makes you think more of the characters as actual living beings instead of merely icons that exist only to save the day. If there's one thing I have to complain about, it's that the collectible cards for the gallery in each level don't really do anything other than serve as a means to get an achievement. It comes off as more of a nitpick though, as older games had plenty of collectibles that only existed for bragging rights, but it could've doubled replay value if the cards let you view concept art or something after collecting them, as even people who aren't completionists by normal standards would have a reason to seek them.  I highly encourage anyone looking for a good action platformer to pick up this game; it's well worth the $15.",

You will feel the nostalgia from the old Sonic games like Sonic The Hedgehog and Sonic The Hedgehog 2 and 3! Yes the gameplay will feel like Sonic but, It brings out new gameplay features in a 2D game that wasn't available in the past! You can LITERALLY FIGHT you're way past enemy's instead of just boosting like in some Sonic games. The voice acting is incredible for the characters and the soundtrack gives you great songs to listen to! If i were to rate this game fairly; I'd give it a 10 out of 10! Now as for 'trends' through the internet/YouTubers (like myself). I'd give this a TEN OUTTA TEN! (If anyone gets the ref. You deserve a cookie). This game is worth the money!",

This is a wonderful game with great music, good characters, a surprisingly decent story and even has little cutscenes to keep the story moving.   If you liked old sonic games, you'll love this and not because it's a re-tread. You'll love it because it's worth loving and it will bring out the kid in you a little.",

With that out of the way, this game is like a bunch combination of games from the genesis era (mostly Sonic the Hedgehog 3) made into an awesome loveletter to the era its originated from, and it stands on its own great.   There's speedy platforming combined with awesome boss battles. At first the boss battles felt too crazy for my tastes but oh boy do they get excited after you get used to the controls.  The soundtrack is just great, all the content the game got, the multiple playable characters, all the little easter eggs and secrets. I highly recommend this to anyone, no matter the skill level. since the game got 4 difficulties to select so anyone can enjoy.  ",

It easily beats all of the classic Sonic games combined in terms of style and enjoyment. The game crashes occasionally and it can be a bit difficult at first to get a gamepad working (or at least it was for me), but those are my only complaints about the game. The music is amazing, the characters are cool, the level design is excellent, and the story is exactly what it should be in terms of length and complexity.  There are three playable characters, and you have a choice between just playing the levels in order or going through the story. Each character controls very differently, and I can easily see myself eventually beating the game three times to experience everything (the levels are almost the same for each character, but the varied playstyle keeps things fresh). A fourth character has been added to time attack and will eventually be playable regularly as well.  Seriously, buy this game. I wouldn't have felt cheated if I had paid $60 for this. The only legitimate reason for skipping this game would be because you don't like platformers. If you like platformers, even a little, buy this and be blown away. If you played Sonic the Hedgehog growing up, buy this and weep for what the series should be and could have been in the modern age.",

This game is Freedom Planet; a game where you platform your way through levels and beat bosses similarly to the olden Marios and Sonics. It has a story, but I am writing this review late at night and don't have time for a plot synopsis. I've not tried out the other characters, but the ACTUAL DRAGON you can play as is actually very versatile. You can double jump, boost in mid air forward or diagonally, and you have a lot of punches and kicks to throw out as well. The game's graphics are just plain beautiful, and (random tangent) the A.I. system in the 2nd to last level will definitely give you a chuckle when it attempts to stop you in a verbal and an explosive manner. Voice acting doesn't ALWAYS go well in indie video games, but you can play the game in a mode where cutscenes don't exist if you care that much. Then again, 'CYCLONE' will probably be a word tied to this game forever once you play because the voice clip doesn't honestly fit the action. woo, i double jumped. Anyway, this game is pretty great.

It went on my wishlist, which I use as a 'buy later' list and I forgot all about it until my cousin bought it for me as a gift.  The only thing I regret about this game is not getting it sooner.  This game has an excellent running gameplay style that will remind you of certain games with a certain blue guy with red sneakers who, let's face it, hasn't been doing games in this style as of late. If you've played any of the older Sonic Games, the playstyle will be right at home.   This game doesn't mimic the old SEGA style of play however, merely the asthetics. Instead of running and jumping, the game adds an attack button and life counter, and THAT changes everything. The combat mechanic changes the game from stale but still fun to innovative and exciting in half a heartbeat. The mechanics of the attack button are intuitive and fun and the fact that each player has a different style of play makes the game very fun.  Graphics are cartoony and remeniscient of the oldschool while keeping its own new style. The story and graphics match the gameplay seamlessly and the music binds it together into a whole that I honestly enjoy more than I probably should.   The only bad thing I have to say about this game, like I mentioned earlier, is that I should've gotten earlier. This game is a definite must buy for fans of Sonic who are looking for the old school gameplay and a little something new.",
