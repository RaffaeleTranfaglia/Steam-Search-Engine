            "review_text": "Zheros: ~~~~~~   Mike and Captain Dorian are members of the intergalactic team called, “Zheros,” which combats crime in the universe. This time, they are facing the evil Dr. Vendetta who wants to mutate every living creature and transform them into his minions. This is definitely not going be a walk in the park; it will be a challenging mission for “Zheros!”  Zheros is an action / 3D beat’em up game where you play either Mike or Captain Dorian from the Zheros squad in single mode, or you can play with someone else on a local co-op mode. This game is absolutely frantic from the start. You will face several types of enemy as you progress into the game. The most comment one will be the white robots with a triangular shaped head, but you will encounter other really tough ones like the “Space Cow”. As in all good beat’em up games, you have to maximise your combos to get as many points as you can. On top of that, your character will have a shield to protect him/her from projectiles and punches, as well as a mounted gun on his/her forearm to use if you are in a pickle (they are plenty in this game)!   Collect all the golden tokens by destroying the orange boxes and do not forget about the golden star; there is one hidden in each level. At the end of the level, you will be able to see how many tokens you have collected and how many RP’s you will get for them. You will need RP’s to upgrade Mike and Captain Dorian’s abilities; more moves, better shield or more damage with your mounted gun.  Also, there are blue, green and red cylinders; the blue one will help you with your ammunition and the green one will regenerate your health. All I can say for the red cylinder is shoot at them when your enemies are close to them…hehehehe, BOOM!   Levels will also have obstacles, electric grids, lasers and more.  I really enjoy the 3D cartoonist graphics in this game and the animations are fabulous. The levels are fun and challenging. The controls are really responsive. The soundtrack will keep you pumped and help you to beat the upcoming levels.  Positives: ~~~~~~~   - Great 3D cartoonist graphics - Fun, fast and frantic gameplay - Really good animations - Plenty of moves - Achievements and trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - RP not equally distributed in Co-op mode  A great, fun and fast 3D beat’em up game to have in your library. Highly recommended!  8.5/10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!
