            "review_text": "Sword of Asumi is a visual novel set in the Edo period...apparently. I really didn't see any resemblence to the Edo period throughout the game, or any sign that the Edo period was still in effect. They just say that it's the Edo period and according to web site descriptions, this is a timeline where the Edo period never ceased, so technically all of the advancements brought on by succeeding eras never should have happened. I'm looking too much into this.  Anyways, you play as Asumi, whom I can only describe as an awkward assassin with a very rare chronic stripping disorder. At least that's the joke I make, because the writer thought it'd be a great idea to show her changing out of her clothes or laying around in excessive lingerie all of the time for no arbitrary reason. The writer also thought it'd be a great idea to make the main character seduce a creepy, perverted principal instead of quietly sneaking into his office to get what she needed. On that note, I should remark that they ruin this 'highly trained' assassin character unbelievably fast and turn her into a cliche school girl that's so socially awkward, it's depressing. Being able to blend in should be a part of your job as an assassin.  The writer also thought it'd be a great idea to make a martial arts centric visual novel without really having any understanding of martial arts at all. As an example, I bring a quote from the narrative of the game, 'Like lightning, Hikari slides to the side, raising his arms in a classic fighting stance ready to initiate a strong of blows.' First off, wow. That was a thing that was written. Second, a classic fighting stance? Like what? Be more specific. Third, a strong of  blows...what?   The writer also thought it'd be a great idea to present a main character who wants to become a Justicar, who can become one in the end of the game without really understanding the principles of being a Justicar. Example, you can kill the hell out of the principal, indirectly causing tons of innocent murders, or you can kill a couple of innocents yourself. Whatever tickles your fancy. You still get to become a Justicar either way. The writer also thought it'd be a great idea to make day time backgrounds, but not night time backgrounds for the same area. Later in the game, characters will talk about it being night time when the background is clearly bright as day. Near the end of the game, one of the day time backgrounds is blatantly lowered in brightness to 'resemble' night time. I am not kidding.  The writer also thought it'd be a great idea to present 2 love interests that could be completely uprooted from the game and have absolutely no impact on the story whatsoever. With one of the routes I went, I encountered one of these love interest characters a net total of TWO times throughout the story. One of which was optional. The other love interest is simply there to play the best friend role. She also happens to cosplay (EDO PERIOD) and at one point, can make Asumi cosplay as well. Does this change anything in the main story? No, not even in the slightest.  It was clear that the maker of the game knew his audience and I can't fault him for that, but at least give the game a bit more substance. Draw in a bigger crowd than who you're obviously trying to bait into buying and liking this blatantly half-baked thing. If you can't write any better, hire a writer! Have someone else convey your words and story in a less embarrassing way. I mean, you Kickstarted this game, so you had the funding. Not sure where it went though... Probably to the composer responsible for the absolutely maddening soundtrack of this game.  Speaking of Kickstarters, AJTilley (the maker of the game) recently started a Kickstarter for the sequel to Sword of Asumi (to my dismay). He showed off some artwork that was already present on his website. He also introduced a new character that is blatantly a near carbon copy of a character from a series that his target audience is probably very familiar with (Sinon from Sword Art Online). Did he show anything else? No, not really. In fact, he canceled the Kickstarter a couple of weeks later, for the reason that he had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for the sequel. He wanted to Kickstart a game that he had absolutely nothing to show for. The sad part is that it almost met half of its funding, with NOTHING to show for it. Astounding.  Enough of the Kickstarter though. Back on the subject of this game. It's not good. The writing is pretty bad. None of the characters were sold on me. The story is excessively boring and a train wreck. The game as a whole is a blatant bait for fanservice loving anime fans to buy the game and enjoy the main character changing into excessive lingerie that she just happens to be wearing under her regular clothing all of the time for no reason. That's a great two word summary. 'No reason.'  Why does this game exist? No reason.  Why does the sequel want to exist? No reason.  Why am I writing this review? To express my befuddlement at the existence of this game and the fact that the person responsible for it tried to fund the sequel with absolutely nothing to present his 104 backers, who mindlessly funded it anyways. But other than that? No reason.  I will revisit this game though...on a stream, while inebriated. Why? No reason.",

            "review_text": "Right. I am probably approaching this game from the wrong angle, but I was lured into my expectations.  First of all the preview and the intro lead me to believe it is going to be terrorist-hunting, secret plot-uncovering, 'Tinker, tailor...' kind of a story. Well, it's not. In fairness there is a terrorist, but our 'Strong, Deadly, Female Protagonist' spends very little time looking for hir. Instead she is visiting pools, cosplays and blushes when anyone talks to her. She kills people for living, for heaven's sake, how can she be that shy? Long story short: it's a date sim with teeny-bit of a murder built in. The game does not even give us an opportunity NOT to try to start any relationship at the end.  Speaking of short stories: this one is extremely abrupt. It does feel fast-paced, especially if you consider the number of characters it introduces. The steadier development of a plot would have allowed the intrigue to unveil, but no, we have to deal two-week deadline and hence, the” brilliant” conclusions like “Orochi would choose to attend fighting classes, so this non-fighting chap is definitely innocent”. Are you willing to bet the Edo citizen’s lives on this, Asumi? How old are you?! By the way… how old is she exactly? All kinds of frisky lingerie she is wearing would rather suit a woman than a schoolgirl, and yet our heroin blends in the Academy perfectly, age-wise.  Granted, I might be harsh here, due to being caught off-guard. My limited experience of this genre consisted of “Long Live the Queen” and “Analogue: hate story”, both of which were brutal, dark and involving. So this wacky nonsense didn’t live up to the expectations.  All in all: if you are looking for an interesting plot, character’s development and a food for thoughts do keep looking somewhere else. If you are in for a teen romcom… still choose something different, because “Sword of Asumi” does not deliver on this field either.  P. S. To be just: the soundtrack is really worthy of being sold separately. This song is magnificent.",

            "review_text": "This visual novel feature a female assassin Asumi from the Black Clan who is approached by a Justicar Kami to enrol in classes at Battle Academy and attempt to discover the identity and eliminate The Raven within the academy who is planning an armed rebellion and overthrow the current Edo rulers through a major terrorist attack. At the academy, Asumi is introduced to her fellow classmate and immediate dormitory room neighbour Kaori, her academy prefects Mineko and Utsuro, members of the presidential squad Hikari, Keiji and Sen along with additional minor supporting characters.  Asumi's study at the academy begins by being simple and innocent, with the option to attend a choice of course subject to study or practice in and make a good or bad impression on any of the four characters Kaori, Mineko, Utsuro or Hikari she can date, fall in love with and eventually obtain a good, neutral or bad ending.   The story will gain momentum and start to become more fast-paced with the death or dismissal of the academy principal, several mysterious student deaths, the departure of Asumi's handler Kami back to the capital, the arrival of several mysterious black garbed figures, a kidnapping on the replacement academy principal and eventually Asumi expressing her love to a main character and a final confrontation with one of the main characters.  Soundtracks and graphic novel DLCs are great and overall game presentation is good after factoring in background music. It would have been better if the choices to kill or disable a potential hostile enemy Asumi encounters in the story have more far-reaching consequences beyond just a short mention of the person being killed or knocked unconscious very soon after the choice is made. Recommended when game with soundtrack and graphic novel DLC (Deluxe edition) are at discount or in bundle offer as all endings and the entire game's unlockable CG at gallery can be completed in less than 10 hours.",

Besides that, I can still recomment it for 3 reasons: + You can get it for less than a buck. + I had fun at the first playthrough (like 2 hours). ++ Easy achievements for a 100% completionist (+/- 4 hours).  So yes, give Asumi a chance if you have it somewhere in your library :(",

            "review_text": "[Neutral Review]  The protagonist is a young girl named Asumi, living in an alternative universe Japan, where she is trained to become a Justicar: a group of female assassins who fight in the shadows against threats to Japan. Asumi is sent to Battle Academy in a mission to find a dangerous terrorist named Raven while disguised as a normal student.  The game has everything to be a great game. But sadly, the second Asumi steps onto campus, the terrorism plotline is shoved into the background and instead you'll start playing a date sim game where most of your choices won't matter until near the end of the game.  Most of the characters also lack a good background story, being like empty shells. That being said, even though the game is kind of mediocre, you can still have a bit of fun with it. There're a plenty of endings, options (although most of them won't influence the ending you'll get) and romanceable characters. It can be a fun game if you aren't very picky with Visual Novels. If you're, don't even try: you'll probably think this one is a total failure.",

It all disolves way too quicly to be meaningful or even belieavable. I feel that the last few choices unbalance the whole thing cos they seem to have the greatest impact but the game gives only a few dialogue lines to wrap the story up which is way to little to prevent you from feeling unsatisfied.  I still give this VN the thumbs up because it was enjoyable overall and altrough I wouldn't recomend buying this at full price if you get it discounted for &gt;=50% it's mostly worth it.",

            "review_text": "The interactive novel deserves a 'Meh.' Nothing is wrong with the story or art and I even enjoyed my time with it, but the issue lies within the fact there just is very VERY little content. After you have played it once you have seen over half of the content, play it a second time and you will see the rest. Now there are different ending that require choices, but none of these seem to have impact. I got 2 hours out of the story and that is with completing all endings, seeing all paths and completing all achievements. I only used a guide for one ending and found the rest on my own.  Perfectly worthwhile to play if you got in in a bundle or on deep discount, but this sub two hour to 100% completion(my extra time is from idling for cards) interactive novel is not worth the asking price.",

And even though the game has gotten the tag of nudity, there is no nudity to be seen, in this, or any edition of the game as it is now.  Quite the story, with an choose your own adventure visual novel style, like most dating sims. Lots of both major and minor NPC's to create an interesting and at times intense adventure as you try to find the Raven.  If you do want an AJTilley game that does contain nudity, any of the others (with the exeption of Highschool Romance) would suit you more than this one.

As in what if you wanted to be a Libertine/ Hoe, Maybe the Bad Boy / Girl / Principle didn't disgust you? What if you wanted a Harem or Bi-Ending? You're an amoral assassin, maybe you stay without scruples. What if you want to go on a bloody rampage since the characters annoyed you? Maybe before just you confess your love, you say the hell with it, just kill them? What if you wanted to join the bad guys? How waiting outside boat house after verify the bad guys have new principle and kill everyone in the boat house as they leave? After all this character is an assassin and killer, maybe they just flip and kill the red head justicar. Fun game, but they really could have played it more for laughs and give more player control. Wouldnt an assassin pursue fake relationships with suspects, have her way with them, kiss/kill them and have a romantic relationship on the side? Maybe the justicar returns as you body count goes up? (might required a skill based system to see if you survive). Lastly, maybe I choose not confess to anyone and just killing all the suspects early since the justicar is gone.",

Seriously, in time span of less than 2 weeks characters already miss each other without deep relationship? WTF, AJ Tilley... Music is terribly looped and is quite average... doesn't set mood well, it's not good, but not bad (technically). Strong point will be cute graphics and number of them. You can also get app to create your own characters - choose their clothing, hair, etc. However, I noticed that game doesn't include sprites many sprites of emotions - smile, regular, blush, and something else. A few. Story itself is hard to rate (not finished game), however I already noticed some mistakes in texts [check my screenshots, I'll keep uploading more stuff] and some dialogues are dull.  Considering price and quality, I could only recommend it to person who's into many visuals and when it's on big sale (like -75%).  PS: Why people sell soundtracks when you can extract them from game? PS2: It downloads Soundtrack as folder and as ZIP file. So it takes more space than it should.   Edit: I managed to get 2 endings so far. And developer is just scammer in my eyes (prices not adequate to quality). And really lazy person - he's from England, but his text is quality of other bad novels, that had to be translated, like 'Russian Horror Story'. It really reminds me of 'A Detective's Novel', with good graphics, that are only TO BAIT YOU, when you feel naughty and horny. ",
