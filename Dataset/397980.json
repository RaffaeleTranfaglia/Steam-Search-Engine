I sencierly hope that the develepors find a new profession and delete this crap form the store. Nothing more to say to this stupid ugly boring repetetive, exhausting, utterly stupid 'game'.",

            "review_text": "This game is strangely nostalgic and enjoyable, It's definately worth checking out.  Unsure why, but this game gives off a strong vibe of an older game without trying to force the impression like many other games.  To keep my review from being confusing: the graphics aren't great, the enemies are generic and the game itself is as simple as it gets. Still I enjoy playing and trying to beat it.",
