The physics seem spot on, and the AI is just tough enough for someone with my skill level. The genral polish of the game is good and I realy like how you're able to adjust both table position and paddle position in an intuitive way.  The only feedback I have is cosmetic. The bunny mask guy is creepy it would be nice to customize that, there is no door anywhere in the room which just seems wierd, and the couch is in a terrible place for watching TV :)",

Occasionally game reminds you that this is a VR world - be it by letting you hear your opponend through mic com or by dropping a frame or two between plays. Other than that this is solid yes, even for full price (which is not term I use often with Vive VR games).  Also - the AI is amazing. I know I am not pro, so impressing me isn't that hard, but I like the way it plays and behaves between plays. It does feel like real human being! (although it wouldn't hurt if he could say something from time to time - seriously not much of a talker this one).",

Get this game, lets play! :) Even just rallying with the AI is fun, he seems to lack the ability to hit balls that are angled off the sides of the table however.",

I play 'real-life' table tennis with my friends regularly and I can tell you that this comes pretty close to the real deal. I can actually play in the traditional Chinese 'penhold grip' with my Vive controller without any issues - which is freaking awesome! The online features are also pretty neat. Playing against others is real fun. I have met very nice people online already. Unfortunately, there are not that many players around, so sometimes ping might be an issue. The AI is also pretty nice to warm up to. There is also an option to play some mini games, although they are rather limited.  TL;DR: If you love table tennis and want to give it a try in VR, buy this game now! I also think that the price tag is very fair and the game is ever improving! A true VR treasure - one of my favourite games so far for the VIVE :)",

            "review_text": "I love this game. The physics of the ball react exactly how they would in real life. You also get a good workout from this game jumping around the room like a freak. You do need a decent amount of space though. I'd say 2x2.5 meters and 3 sensors (Oculus) would be ideal. To have the optimal online gaming experience, both you and your oponent should have a very fast internet connection. Otherwise you may experience lag and not always be able to see your oponent hit back wich results in you missing the ball. The devs are still adding new features to the game which is awesome. I would love to see an option to turn the world by 90Â° so you can adjust it to your playspace and sensors. I give this game 5/5. Definately worth 10$. Thank you developers for this entertaining experience!",

I donwloaded this the other day and I like so much that there is no need for that ping pong table any more. You can play against the AI or online against others, works very well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone",

After 20+ minutes it's clear that the physics is pretty solid and it's actually quite a lot of fun, but you can't spin the ball so no nifty plays using that. One environment, single or multiplayer some rather simplish minigames. That's it.  Borderline worth it.",
