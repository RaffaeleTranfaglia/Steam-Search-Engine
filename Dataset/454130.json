            "review_text": "  Nil-Ninjahtic: Ronin brings a nostalgia feel that you would get from classic titles on old portable Nintendo devices, with a simplistic style the game has a cleverly laid out retro level design which reminds gamers of that 80's feel when playing a video game. Blaze Epic created a game that is progressively more challenging as you progress through the game, although difficult to master where eventually you have to solve puzzles while defeating enemies and doesn't follow the linear game structure making it hard to predict future events. The game has controller support if you want to play the game in a living room environment or if you are used to the feel of a console controller. If you want a short small sized game that would last 2-3 hours of gameplay that is full of action and adventure then this is the game for you. At the low price tag, this game is a steal, even when it is not on sale.  *Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*",
