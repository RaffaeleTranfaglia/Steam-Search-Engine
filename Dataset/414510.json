Everything is procedurally generated, like terrain, enemies, weapons, items &amp; quests. Planet Xax's war rages on... how is that possible?",

Pshaw, enter an otherworldly adventure of perpetual warfare.  Freeform skill development? Check. Diverse weapon component system? Check. Hoverboard + Grapple Hook across the world mayhem? Check check and CHECK!  If you liked 3089, then I can guarantee you'll like 5089, and while it's more 'expandalone' than true sequel, the changes to the gameplay and game engine are brilliant.  2000 years have passed since the events of 3089, and the planet Xax is falling apart around its inhabitants audio receptors. The Overlord has gone missing and a new Master has risen to a position of influence. The Gold robots find themselves hunted almost to extinction in one last outpost and their Purple enemies are -everywhere-  With a greater focus on capturing bases, and more streamlined gameplay, this is a fantastic game and a worthy successor to the original and provides more 'sandbox' gameplay than many AAA titles. Sure, there's 'boss' robots to hunt to progress the storyline...or you could just strike out in a direction and conquer Xax!  Heartily recommended!",

If you've got your 'VR legs' you *owe* it to yourself to try out 'mixed mode' movement option, which allows 'standard' controller FPS movement using the thumbpad on one Vive controller, but also allows you to stop and use your body to physically walk expore a location, or to physically aim your gun at enemies with your real hands.  The first time I was straffing around an enemy like I would in a typical FPS while using my real life hands to keep my gun pointed at an enemy I was trying to destory- oh man- it was like a lightbulb went off. THIS IS THE EFFING FUTURE!   The Mixed mode VR control is a friggin' model for how FPSes in the future should allow movement. Seriously - I would *kill* to play a like Skyrim with a movement system like this! Once you get a feel for it, it feels AMAZING to zoom around, leaping through the air (again, once your VR legs are strong enought to handle it without nausea).   There are rough edges every here and there, sure, but the dev is very active, and has made *tons* of changes in response to suggestions made after people started actually getting their VR headsets.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR Grinding skill points until you can fight a large boss.  So where do i start...  The gameplay: So you start off without a weapon, so you go buy one and some ammo and start a quest. At the end of the quest you are rewarded with skill points which can be spent on various skills. Every quest is random, and so is the entire world, although with the same kind of quest (for example: Go kill someone, go catch a rogue probe, go escort someone). Once you have high enough skills you will go and fight a giant robot which progresses you futher into the story. Enemies drop armor, parts of weapons and consumables like health. These can be sold or used. The parts of weapons/armour are then combined at a workstation. No weapon parts have the same stats. (This is starting to sound like a guide right now) There are other bases just like yours but owned by the voilet (The enemy robots) which you can take over. There are also buildings with spiked roofs and at the top of these buildings is a boss which once killed will give you a high level item and some conversion points which power other buildings outside of your base. Quests accepted outside of your base will give you a lot more skill points but are harder as you are pretty much always under fire.  The graphics: may not be the best, but they fit with the game.  The sound track: It is unique although there is only about 6 songs, all of which are great but are always playing and are bound to get repetetive at some point (The underground song kinda spooks me D: ).  The weapons: There are Rifles, shoot a single powerful and long ranged bullet, energy rifle, which i assume does the same but consumes energy instead of ammo, launcher, Kind of confusing as one kind shoots explosive grenades (Kind of like the demoman from TF2) while the other shoots like a shotgun. there are a few others but i can't be bothered to write about them and hope you can see the rest yourself.  Storyline: Imaginative. Nuff said.  Phr00t: Fixed my save file when i accidently corrupted it. Amazing.",

It fully utilises the motion controllers . Analog movement can be toggled, teleporting is here too for those new to VR or you can combine the both in mixed mode. Aiming with guns feels fantastic seeing the environments in full 3D with huge structures and skirmishes blows my mind you feel like you are in the game! It's crazy. 5089 also supports coop multiplayer!! So you can share the adventure with a friend.  5089 has full classes and character development too 100's of hours of fun, for less than 6 quid",

So please don’t be afraid about the graphics before you know about the “intrinsic values” of the game. By the way, this game has been created by a single person, who listen to his community! If you have questions or something else, the developer (phr00t) will not just answer you through the community hub – no, you also will get an invitation and he will discuss with you about through the chat!  I try now to list all features you can expect:  • randomly generated open world (also into the sky) with weather system and day-night cycle  • randomly generated weapons, armours, utilities (such as Gravity gun), dropped by enemies or sold at shops • feel free to kill everyone, steal from everyone and build anything anywhere! • different types of enemies and confederate robots (also suicide bombs and UFOs) with randomly generated weapons stats • 2 different factions of robots and a ghost like native life-form called “Xax” • a short story based in future connected with previous games which will be continued by killing bosses • possibility to change the speed of gameplay to match it challenging but not frustrating • earning conversion points and border new areas for your faction • a stats system, which is comparable with borderlands, but even better!!! • great working physics such as bullet drop, - speed, -range, gravity overall • 6 types of weapons composed of 3 to 5 different weapon parts (body, barrel, magazine, silencer, scope) • swords and daggers composed of 2 different parts • bullet based and energy (chargeable) weapons • 7 types of utilities which are also composed of 2 different parts:  2 different types of gravity guns, grappling hook, teleporter, decoy (spawns a supporting robot), hoover board and a crafting gun (to build each kind of walls, turrets, teleporter, planes, …) • 3 types of armour composed of 2 different parts • microchips composed of 2 different parts, which improve your skills • different types of available planes • 12 different skills to spend your points, which determine your play style significantly! • earning skill point by randomly generated quests, border new areas, taking down special enemies • respec your skill points • deadly lightning bolts and meteorites • stealth system influence by different conditions:  noises, brightness, rain, skill points, movement • Virtual Reality, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive (unfortunately I’m not able to test this :/ ) • multiplayer and coop (but honestly there are less people at the moment)   I’m sure there are still more things I forgot about or I even didn’t know now, but therefore give this game a chance and find it out – I’m sure you wont regret it.",

            "review_text": "TL:DR If you have a Vive, this game is good fun, if you have a Vive (or Rift) AND a Virtuix Omni, this game is extremely fun. If you do not have VR, this game is still, fun. :)  5089 is a unique game made by a single dev who is very active in his community, both on a Forum level, and on a direct 1:1 level if you really show that you care. The game is built using both a bit of story and experience from the Dev himself on past games like 4089, 3089, and 3079. All great games in their own right, but 5089 is its own game and is the best of them yet. (IMO)  I don't have as much time into the game as I would like due to life being what it is, but when I do want to jump into an RPG game that has a decent bit of depth, Functional Procedural Generation that puts No Man's Sky to shame (it may only be 1 planet, but dag nabbit that planet is unique, filled with mystery and danger, and overall true adventure at every turn. Not just another rock, checkpoint, or flying cow, but more like Flying Death RayBOT!) and yet it is simple enough that once you get the basic concept down of how to progress yourself in the game, it is easy to play without having to do a lot of thinking and micromanagement planning. Sure some of the gameplay can get a bit samey and stale if you keep doing the same thing over and over, but if you push yourself in this sort of RPG Sandbox to explore way out past the initial spawning point, get a good gang of friendly robots to cover your back, and put your EXP points into the best slots for your play style, you can make the fun keep on coming as you barrel through the enemy base and the bosses that wait for you.  Onto the VR part of the game, while phr00t has done a great job with VR support for both the Rift (through SteamVR) and the Vive (with some good roomscale based design choices), my favorite way to play is on the Virtuix Omni. This is one of the few games that works fantastically on the Omni that allows you to run around on the Omni in the direction you are facing, while aiming/shooting independently with your Vive remotes as you go. It is incredibly immersive and a dang good workout as you sprint around the maps and take bases. Without the Omni the Roomscale is the next best way to play without getting motion sick, however like all FPS games in VR, I don't recommend playing with the Vive/Rift sitting down as the motion disconnect can hit you right in the VR Gut so to speak. You have been warned. (Same warning applies to Minecraft, which is another fantastic game on the Omni.)  Lastly, some people do seem to have odd performance issues with the game, but I am not one of them.  It may not be the most advanced game on Steam, but it is definitely one that provides ample supply of fun.",

            "review_text": "VR REVIEW I reccomend this. I want to say that from the outset. I think it's good, but not without its problems. Some good things about it are its large scope, high replayability and good general gameplay.  The two problems i have with it are the size of the world/movement and combat. I think that the world you have to move around in is too big. You shoot a ball that can roll, and teleport to it when its in a spot you want. This ball can cover great distances. Despite this, you spend 80% of your time shooting the ball over and over and over and over to get from point a to point b. It can also be hard to get into bases, when there are slots in the side that seem like naturally entry point, but the ball doesnt fit inside. This resulted in me shooting the ball into the wall several times until i got close enough to stick my arm through.  The combat could be good. COULD. The problem is that your rate of fire is very low, your accuracy is deplorable, and reloading takes ages with no visual feedback (that i could tell) on how long the reloading actually takes. I understand wanting to have poorish accuracy to make it more 'realistic' or difficult or whatever, but its VR, if im pointing my gun straight at an enemy, the bullet should go at least somewhere near where i shoot. The reloading also needs some work, becuase you have no idea when you will be able to shoot again next, so you're torn between moving (which stops the reload) and waiting to get a shot off.  This game is good. Hopefully they can fix these relatively minor issues that I believe will make the game much much better.",

You can move around the world by walking, stealth sneaking, sprinting and leaping, riding a hoverboard, piloting an aircraft, shooting a telelocator ball or grappling hook, or teleporting. Lots of loot to sort through. Different weapon types - melee and ranged. Different kinds of guns you can build or buy, from a silent sniper rifle to a short range machine gun to a powerful rocket launcher or grenade launcher. Lots of activities to do either on your own or with allies you can recruit - you can complete quests, take down enemy headquarters, take over enemy bases, kill bosses, or just explore the world, steal from your allies and kill enemy robots.
