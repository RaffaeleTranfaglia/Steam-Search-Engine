            "review_text": "Software does some neat stuff that makes building battle mat's accessible to more people and with lower effort. It could use some improvements in utility like copying and pasting sections (placing many walls is needlessly time consuming). As well as camera controls with auto move the camera into looking down perfectly, if you have the camera at a small angle and take a picture then software like fantasy grounds will have a very hard time indentifying squares due to perspective.  The real problem with the software are the business decisions behind it. $30 for the intiial buy in is pretty good. I would have paid $40. However it comes with assets only for the more classic dungeons. Clearly the model is to sell lots of DLC to flesh out the capabilities of the program. The problem here is that the first DLC (published a week into 'early-access' mode and before a number of basic functionalities like I mentioned above are incldued), is $15. If you need only the base software to do what you want then this is probably worth the cost. But if you are looking for a map-making software to invest in for the long-haul then Multiply that $15 out by 10-15-20 over time as you buy all the DLC. The cost is high, and the developer response has been to say 'tough luck'.   Ultimately I would say for SURE wait until this software is out of 'early access' As it may provide you with a better view of what their DLC roadmap looks like. Right now it's dismaying. I suspect that once it is out of early access it might be worth buying a big pack of DLC if sufficiently discounted, but either way you will have a better idea of what costs your opting into.",

I'm also dissappointed with the DLC policy that have me pay extra for what I feel should had been a part of the package right from the beginning.   Closing word: If youre looking for a way to project a map on a TV and play directly on the picture, or just to show of how a cave or dungeon looks, this might be it but it's more or less useless when it comes to a VTT.",
