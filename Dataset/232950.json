A few weeks ago I had to reinstall it, because I got a new computer, and now when I play my bridges almost always fail. Same basic designs from when I played before, but this time none of them work. Then there are the times when the bridge will just *fall apart without reason*.   This game has some serious physics flaws, and what's worse is that there are no truly correct setups as one may work for one level, and fail utterly the next level, even with conditions being exactly the same. This game needs some serious polish. I can't recommend it.",

It doesn't take any real engineering knowlege to get through the levels, or at least not anything you can't look up easily. The game is ok, and feels like something I'd play on my tablet in between classes to kill time. It has no tutorial, and no manual leaving you to figure out things for yourself which is fine most of the time, except when it comes to one or two things like using pistons. Figuring out those can be frustrating. The most irritatiing part of the game is when the materials are so restricted that it forces you to play 'what was the level designer thinking' instead of what would actually be the best solution. If the price dropped to 1 dollar I'd recommend it, if you're into games like this. Otherwise forget it.",

I wish I would have actually looked at the reviews before buying this horrible example of a physics simulator. The controls are not user friendly and the physics do not respond like you would imagine. There are more issues with the game but I don't feel like putting in the effort...since the game makers didn't put any effort in make the simulator it's only appropriate. Nothing about this game is worth $19.99. I would not be as bummed if it was only $4.99 and sucked this bad (which is still over priced for what you get) but at $19.99 I'm totally upset. Can't blame anyone but myself though. The reviews spot all the glaring problems with this game and I didn't even think of scrolling down to read them before I bought it.",

I found this cheap and decided to buy it to get rid of some left over money from my PaypPal account, I honestly regret it despite the fact that I only paid £1.50 for it. Don't buy this game, it's not worth anything and am amazed that Steam is even willing to publish a game like this.  The physics engine is pretty bad regardless of the fact that the whole point of this game is to be based around the physics of the bridge. The stress of the bridge is practically random and makes the game way too awkward to complete a simple task. The bridge sometimes decides to throw parts of the bridge away just by a car crossing it instead of showing any strain on the actual bridge or supports, making it impossible to know what part of the bridge needs improving.  The graphics are terrible and I highly doubt that the recommended PC specifications are completely correct. The shading works correctly but is done badly, the textures are bad, visual layout,ect. The visuals and overlay are terribly designed and makes windows XP scheme look good. You can even see the edges of the map you're designing on.  Another terrible aspect of the game is the audio. It's terribly done to the point it sounds like stock footage and has no variety what so ever, If I play this for more than a few minutes the audio begins to make me cringe.  Finally, the setup of designing is over complicated and difficult to know where the tools are and throws additional tools onto your setup which you will never use or need and covers half of the screen space. The tools are awkward to use and is annoying to remove multiple parts of the bridge.  The concept of the game is a good idea, but it's already been done a ton of times with a lot more effort put into it and has been executed better with less awkward features including the ability to actually complete the game.  I paid 1.50 on a third party site and yet I regret spending it, and somehow the creator thinks that they should sell it for £16? There are millions of games at a much cheaper price I would rather pay for than this with much better concpets, graphics, audio and general gameplay than this. If this was designed in 2003, there wouldn't be a problem, but this was released in 2013. You're 10 years late of a good game.",

The bridges are built from set-pieces and so the trick is to work out the best way of using those pieces to get the result you are after.  The puzzles are simple for the most part, but offer some degree of fun. The physicsl simulation is solid enough and seems to provide consistant results.   There is very little else that can be said about this game to be honest. Its a small puzzle game that offers some very basic engineering challenges. If you like that kind of thing you'll possibly have a bit of fun here. Its not a particually special game nor is there anything very inventive or interesting going on with the puzzles. Just basic and obvious bridge making.   Would I recommend? Not really. If you can grab it cheap as part of a bundle or perhaps during a sale then it might be worth it. However, at the asking price of £15.99 you could spend that money on something much better.",
