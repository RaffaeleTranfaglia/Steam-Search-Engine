The only real failing is that multiplayer is a bit of a wash--you'll have to hunt down folks on the forums if you want to play online.  If this becomes (or already is) available as a mobile app, I'm sure it'll excel. Cheers!",

            "review_text": "Gameplay: Each campaign world introduces a new mechanic, gently expanding Critter Crunch's basic puzzle premise into a diverse field of interactions. The variety of special critters and abilities produces a deep optimization exercise. I had great fun with the puzzle and challenge levels - they encourage studying move consequences that would otherwise go unnoticed in the frenzy of clearing the board.  Controls: Generally quick and responsive, which is ideal for what becomes a twitch puzzler at high levels. However, I wish it took the same time to interact with critters regardless of screen position. Waiting for Biggs' tongue to extend for high-hanging critters needlessly breaks the flow/pacing.  Presentation: The atmosphere of Critter Crunch is beautiful - smiling sprites, vibrant colors, and upbeat tunes. Biggs has so many animation frames that it's fun to pause the game to see what expression the little fellow has at that instant. Funny storyline, definitely the most enjoyable ending within this genre!",

            "review_text": "This game is everything that I hoped it would be. Local co-op with a friend is excellent and we are currently ranked in the 60's. Local versus is a blast. The Xbox 360 controller works like a charm. And by using a program called DS4 Windows my friend is able to use his PS4 controller too. The graphics are exactly what the preview shots look like, somewhat anime-ish with painted backgrounds. I really like it. Music is great. The critters drop down slow at first but if you can survive then the game really does pick up pace, or there is a button you can press to make the rows drop faster. There are a bunch of funny items and tricks to learn. I recommend playing adventure mode first to learn how the game works. But it's also pretty fun to go into local co-op and versus blind with your friend and figure the game out together. Right now we are playing through adventure mode by taking turns and helping one another out (also yelling at each other and making dirty jokes). It's been hilarious. I want it to never end. But even after the main game is completed there are puzzle and challange modes, and always the faithfully entertaining versus and co-op.",

I must agree with another reviewer, I did enjoy playing this on ps3 with the controller more than here with the mouse, it just doesn't seem to have the same feel. This is a must try game even at full price!",

I could happily feed critters and puke rainbows all day. The levels can range from easy to very hard and some may even make you want to rage quit. However in adventure mode you only need to complete 3 per area to unlock the next set and once the other modes are open you can always skip levels and leave the harder ones for later. Overall I think there's plenty of challenge and gameplay for your money and if it's on sale it's a no-brainer for any puzzle fan.",

            "review_text": "I'm not a big fan of puzzle games, but I enjoyed this one. It is basically a twist on color matching puzzle games like Bejeweled (although it is absolutely unique as far as I am concerned). I think Critter Crunch is about as robust as a game centered around a single concept could be.   There are four different single player game modes, as well as two multiplayer modes. The main mode is Adventure mode, which unlocks the other modes and includes some of the challenges and puzzles. Challenges are usually a more frantic pace with a set time limit, and puzzles are more peaceful with no time constraint. Each Adventure mode area has its own unique background, and new gameplay elements are added as you progress for even more variety. The story of a guy studying the critters is shallow but fun. Challenge mode consists of 55 challenges. Puzzle mode consists of 100 puzzles. Survival mode is endless.   For multiplayer modes, there are co-op and versus. I really enjoyed versus where you go head to head with another person with some new powerups. The new powerups are used against the other player and some of them are very satisfying. The mushroom causes hallucinations. Lightning in a jar electrocutes. Etc. The final powerup is unlocked at experience level 12. In order to find people to play multiplayer with, you will probably have to seek them out on the forums.   The art style is very pleasing. The characters are cartoony. There are a variety of painted backgrounds that are nice to look at but don't in any way detract from the gameplay. The gameplay is simple, but it does evolve into challenging and is quite rewarding. The music got a little repetitive for me, but I was never annoyed by it.   As far as value goes, I got this game on sale for $1.46 and have gotten 40+ hours of playtime out of it. Wow.",
