            "review_text": "You find yourself pinned, your pistol only has three bullets.   You hear those damned voices again. You don't know how many are out there, Just that they will not stop until you are dead.   So what should you do? Run, Try to make a last stand? Could you possibly kill them all, Weaken them?    You take a peek out of the bushes and see them looking through the grove to your right. They are sweeping to area in a counter-clockwise fashion and will soon near you. So you grab a rock and lob it in their general direction, in trying to keep their soulless eyes away from your hiding place.   Success! The rock appears to distract the hunters from your impending ousting. You wait for them to turn their backs to you while they attempt to find the source of the noise.   This is your chance! You decide to take out the first hunter you see and make a break for it. You grip your pistol with both hands and start squeezing on the trigger, raising your weapon up in front of you. The crude sights aiming near the sounds of footsteps and crunching of the grass.    Now! You burst out of the brush and hastily fire off two shots into the back of one of the automatons before veering into the opposite direction of the group.   You hope you sent that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to android hell.   You assume you are southbound but you don't have time to check your compass.   'I'll try to find a path out of this place later, the only thing that matters now is that this direction is away from those monsters.'   Inhuman screeching followed by gunshots breaks your train of thought as bullets whiz past you. Your speed doubles and your heart pounds faster than it has even pounded before. You were never a working man, your legs and heart used to feel as if you had just ran a marathon after you went up the stairs.    The fact that you are possibly having a heart attack is the least of your worries right now as a second volley of lead is the more immediate danger.   You make it over a hill and believe you have broken the predators line of sight.   They will catch up soon, think fast! You leap over a fence and sprint towards a nearby ditch. You lie down in an attempt to make yourself less visible and make yourself quieter. You start piling mud on top of yourself to make some impromptu camouflage.   Catching your breath you greedily inhale air for your deprived lungs. You hear voices approach and you slow your breath, hoping that they will ignore you and move past. You hear the wet thumps of metal hitting mud as the pack nears you. Your body tenses up just like the metal demons that are hunting you. You attempt to stay quiet and motionless as they search through the nearby brush searching for you before you finally hear them move on. You lay for what seems to be the longest few minutes of your life before letting out the longest sigh of your life as you reflect on these last few hours and how you nearly died multiple times. The last words you heard before you were deposited on this accursed archipelago echo through your mind.  'Sir, You are being hunted.'",

            "review_text": "Having just finished the game no more than an hour ago, I felt it appropriate that I write an honest review. 'Sir (or Madam), You Are Being Hunted' is a 'procedurally-generated' first person shooter, set in a hilariously extreme British world, where robot gentlemen hunt humans for sport. The game does a lot of things right. The setting is unique, as is the plot. Your job, as the human, is to survive against the robotic apocalypse and track down fragments of a teleportation device that will get you safely out of this 'tweedpunk' nightmare. There are 25 fragments, scattered across five islands. If and when you are caught, the robots will not hesitate to shoot. Should you lose all your health and fall to the ground, you'll be sent back to the place where you last saved. An impressive array of weapons awaits you, however, should you pick and choose your battles wisely. There are weapons ranging from the close-encounter woodcutter's axe to the fine hunting rifle, along with a pistol, shotgun, and blunderbuss. Ammo is scarce, and should be conserved. Along with ammo and weaponry, there are foodstuffs and bandages. If you've ever played Minecraft, you understand that eating food doesn't refill your health. It refills your hunger, which when close to 100%, heals your health. Sir, You Are Being Hunted is very similar. As you traverse the British countryside, your vitality will drop. Eating food will raise that, which will in turn raise your health, should you be recovering from an encounter. tl;dr, This game is great. You'll laugh, you'll jump, and you'll have a heck of a lot of fun. I totally recommend this game, to anyone who enjoys stealthy shoot and loot type games.",

            "review_text": "I have no idea why this has such a bad metacritic score. Maybe im fanboying here, but this game is awesome if you play it the right way. I've started without watching any trailer, without knowing anything about the game. Just after a few minutes I got into the system and immediately felt the survival aspect. After gathering some orbs, a new robot comes into play, which is a cool feature itself, but the discovery of it is the main thing. Wandering through the woods and seeing just a glimpse of a robot you have never seen before, wanting to get a closer look but without risking your life. I have to mention, I don't use the save-function. I play 'hardcore' which adds some more of the survival instinct and makes me overthink my actions. As the maps are all random generated, it makes sense to start over from a whole new map.  As there are 5 different Islands and each one has its own theme, it is again all about the discovery, still in mind that some robot could spot you while you are admiring an interesting building or strucuture. The balance between 'I really want to see what that is' and 'I hope it doesn't kill me though' is perfect.  Like I said, it might be the fanboy effect I'm suffering from, but I got this from various chases through the woods, resulting in a firefight in a small village, while trying to get some robots into a trap I originally set up just to gather another one of these crystals.  This game is brilliant. You really, really should try it if you like the thrill of survival and discovering the mysterious unknown.",

The inventory system is kind of weird to get used it but it teaches you to keep what is   absolutely neceassary  from junk. Overall, I'd say it's a good buy. BUT, and I say this because it should be fixed, after you complete the centre island, the robot spawning on the other islands is crazy. You could do one thing and then be surrounded by 20 robots (I say 20 because this happened to me twice.) You can change the spawing rate which I suggest you do because if you don't it makes the game extremely difficult. Other than that, it's great.",

This is a first person stealth roguelike. It is finished, it works, very well, in fact. It gives you procedurally generated challenges to overcome, while keeping it very obviously british and misty. I love the style and I have not regretted backing it back when it was on Kickstarter. Isnt this the golden age of games where a single game doesnt have to do everything?

Or it explodes and alerts every robot on the island to turn you into swiss cheese. EIther way, I haven't found out yet.  Another great part of the game is the survival aspect. You must always have food to survive. I don't mean a Dead Rat or some gross spuds either. I mean you must always have GOOD food, or in the game's case a lot of whiskey, otherwise you're living on a timer until your Vitality and Health runs out, killing you.  One the the best things is the stealth required in the game. You can't run up to a group of robots later on in the game, otherwise you're asking to get loaded with buckshot. You must sneak up to them, distract them, or my favorite, use a ManTrap on them, which is simply a beartrap reinvented to hunt you. Also, pay attention to your visibility. Robots can spot you from just looking at you so it's best to crouch when they're near and to get a rock or some other cover between you and your hunters.  Overall, this game is great and has a lot of replayabilty considering you can tweak the world generation and the amount of robots. I also think this game would be great if they had more survival features and it was a challenge to survive without the robots.  10/10",

            "review_text": "Being a rural UK resident I really appreciated the rustic, eerie atmosphere of the English countryside presented in this game, an aesthetic that is woefully under-represented in gaming these days. The humour is subtle and effective, but is well mirrored by the genuine sense of threat and menace posed by your robotic pursuers.   Yes, not a lot happens much of the time, but the suspense generated in trying to hide from the hunters to maintain this lack of action (which of course you can choose not to do if you're feeling confident) generates a tremendously engaging experience. Peering towards the horizon to see distant red mechanical eyes pierce the moorland mist fills one with both dread and excitement.   It's certainly not for everyone, but in my opinion the unique steampunk design and atmosphere, along with the replayability offered by procedurally generated environments, makes for a refreshing stealth-survival experience.",

Highly  recommended. •• There isn't really a 'story', but just a brief explanation of what's going on: you're stuck on the archipelago and must collect items to rebuild the thing that gets you out of there. The exploration and strategizing ways around the hunters to get what you need  is  the game. •• You can't hide in buildings or 'save anywhere'. Those things may be OK in other games, but they would absolutely destroy the tension in  Sir . (In fact, the saving system in  Sir  has inspired me to replay Dishonored using only the autosaves.) When you load a save in  Sir , all of the NPCs appear in different places and configurations from when you saved. You don't 'use' saves the way you might in other games. There's no reloading in order to try various tactics against a particular group of hunters. •• If you're a stealth fan, buy  Sir  immediately.",

I'm through now a couple playthrough and I have to say it is quite a great, violent hide-and-seek game. I like the idea of randomly generated worlds which we see quite rarely in games although with todays tech it is more than convenient to build certain games to have this feature. I liked the AI - it payed attention to check out places where they saw some distraction multiple times. And I liked the touch of horror in some robots - personal favorites are the Landowner and the Scarecrow. It's great when you don't notice it, you hear something from behind and when you turn around suddenly a glowing pumkinhead smiles back at you, you unload your rounds (it would be fun if you could shoot yourself in the leg in such frightening moments if you don't aim right), then it minces you in a couple of blows... Or when you sneak through the forest and then for the first time you hear the landkeeper's scream and you open up your inventory and rather drink up all the brew pretending it will make it go away... Another funny factor was when robots started to fight each other. In some playthroughs I've got my first weapon+ammo this way. Love the game! Good work! ;)",

Who very unfortunately gets telly-ported to an alternate dimension of sorts.. Or something along those lines, you know its really hard to hear what the narrator says in the intro. As i was saying.... The poor sod of a scientist gets telly-ported to an alternate (And very British) dimension. Where Robots of the tweed wearing kind, hunt silly humens for sport. And here is where the game starts.   GAMEPLAY:  The gameplay element rolls around stealth about 80% of the time, the remaining 20% are centered on collecting food and SOMETIMES, and i really press SOMETIMES. Attacking a hunting robot, or their dogs. (mangy mutts..)  The main objective is to find and collect the pieces of the experiment that our unfortunate science fellow was working on and transport them to a circle of standing stones... for... I dont know, to finish the game i quess.  But anyway collecting food and certain items to distract the robots are usually found in houses and shanties in the wilderness. Rarely you will find a firearm, which makes fighting those tweed wearing, posh, pipe smoking metalheads alot easier. Unfortunately it also causes a lot of noise and usually alerts every single hunting-party on the whole bloody island...  Anyway for those, trigger-happy, no sense of self preservation types. This game is not for you, since you die. Very very VERY fast.    GRAPHICS:  Not much to say really, i'm not the best person to evaluate the graphical-fidelity of something. But there were a few places where the graphics weren't quite up to snuff... But if you keep in mind that this is still in early access, that is rather easy to forgive. But not forever....   SOUND:  Ambient sounds, 'Bleep-Bloop' Bots and the standart gunsounds. you really cant hear the robots coming easily, which caused me some cheap deaths...   *Needs some work.   CONCLUSION:  Well, i'm not going to say that this is the best stealth-game ever. It has enough small quirks to prevent that.. However it has enough to merit a play, but yet again it beinng a stealth-survival game. It really does not sound that.. 'Appetizing' to some.   So for those who love survival games, i could recommend this rather easily, although with the small issues within it. I could also recommend this for stealth fans, but rather carefully explaining it first...  A solid 7/10.  Its decent in what it does, but as always with everything in an early state, it doesn't do it perfectly. But i still believe this has the material to come a good game, when it is fully ready.",

            "review_text": "Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a stealth exploration game. You've been stranded on a group of small islands, and tasked with finding the scattered pieces of a broken machine, which should help you escape. But the islands are home to strange robots who will attack you on sight.  There are 17 pieces to find, spread across 5 islands whose layouts are randomly generated. They can be identified by a trail of white smoke rising into the air, not high enough to see from behind a building or a hill, but obvious enough that you'll immediately notice if you're looking at it. I like that, instead of just slapping a waypoint marker on each location as some games would do, SYABH trusts the player to actually put some effort in. You might find a scanner that will beep if you're close, but I only had to use it to find the last piece. I found everything else quite easily within 6 hours of gameplay, just by conducting a methodical search.  Along the way you'll need to deal with the various types of robots. To begin with its just a normal human shaped robot with a shotgun, usually hunting in pairs. But over time, more dangerous types start to appear such as robot dogs or robot horse riders. You can decide whether to fight them or avoid them, but you can only save in specific places so you might want to be cautious.  I mostly used the open nature of the islands to keep my distance, only fighting the robots who were guarding the pieces. Guns are not fun to use, they feel slow and weak - probably by design, because the robots struggle with them as well. I had more success by first distracting them either by throwing a bottle or setting an alarm clock, then sneaking up behind and using a powerful axe. Stealth is a tricky thing to get right for me, but I enjoyed this system more than games like Thief or Assassins Creed.  Meanwhile you need to find food, because if your hunger meter reaches zero, your health will start to decrease. If you take damage during combat, your health will automatically regenerate, but only if your hunger meter is high. There is plenty of food available, but you might need to search villages, which are guarded by more robots. Searching buildings can also give various helpful items such as binoculars, matches for lighting a fire to cook raw meat, a map which helps navigation, and more.  Technically the game is solid. Graphics are what you would expect from an indie game, controls are fine on mouse and keyboard, and I didn't suffer any bugs. The most disappointing thing for me was the story. The end was very anticlimactic and failed to really explain anything at all.  Overall I enjoyed SYABH and I would recommend it, if you're looking to play something a bit different to the usual genres.",

            "review_text": "I really like 'Sir, you are being hunted' and I think it's a very special game that deserves your attention, but there are things in this game that stings me in a very uncomfortable way and that may scare away players.     Let's start with the things I liked:      Open world   - First time I jumped into the game I had no idea where to go. North? West? East? South? Stay in Central? In that specific moment of time, I felt the game was drenching me with choices and oppertunities. I like those moments very much and they get rarer each time I play.     Random generation   - This is a part of the game I also enjoyed. When you start a new game you'll have the option to change what biome the islands will have (Except for the center island. It's always rural.) and the amount of enemies you'll face.    The thrill of being hunted   - Since this is a game about stealth, it will punish you for not being stealthy enough and it does so by letting the robots run after you and try to kill you if you've been spotted. Robots will also alert other robots nearby of your presence, which makes the game alot tougher. I have gotten myself hunted and killed a number of times and sometimes a special type of robot will hide in thick patches of forest and wait until you get close enough to them.    And now the things I didn't like:      Graphics and textures   - After about 27 hours of running around on islands looking for fragments I have noticed certain graphical errors such as bricks you're able to see through and houses that looks like tall buildings that just sank into the ground until they hit something.  The textures makes me cringe a little, especially one of the ground textures that reminds me of Call of Duty's digital camouflage but with fitting colours instead of the traditional black, white and grey. Another example of my despise towards some of the textures is in the castle biome. I enjoy walking up in castletowers and looking down on robots with my binoculars but I always notice that the inside of the towers have the exact same texture as the outside which I find to be a little annoying.    The goal of the game   - Collect 17 pieces from the islands. Bring them back to spawn. Win the game. This entire process is quite boring and it prevents me from continuing to play due to all of the motivation that was drained when acquiring just a few of these fragments.  An example of my train-of-thought when returning fragments: 'Alright! Returned 3 in a go and I have ... 9 fragments left?!? *sigh*'  'Screw it! I'll deal with this later.'    The gunplay   - I have to admit that the firearms and weapons lacks authenticity in both sound, look and feeling. The guns have a very basic design and the reload animations are basically non-existent. The revolver's cylinder doesn't pop out of its place so new bullets can get in and double-barreled hunting shotguns doesn't break in the middle. It just tilts itself in a way that makes me think that a hole opens and new shells glide in without me seeing it.  The game compensates this by making ammunition so rare that it is nearly impossible to really observe and analyze how a certain weapon looks and feels like.    Survival   - Survival in games is generally a value that the player has. The player needs to find objects that reduces this value from reaching zero. Survival in this game is exactly what I just described. You walk around and look inside buildings in order to find something to 'eat'. No sound is played to amplify the feeling of eating. You just 'use' the item, it disappears and your hunger has a slightly higher value.     Buildings   - Houses and buildings is a common sight in 'Sir, you are being hunted'. It can get people pretty excited when they can imagine themselfs walking into an uninhabited shelter, desperately looking ammunition, food or tools. Or just seeking refuge. That doesn't apply to this game. Houses in 'Sir, you are being hunted' have the same function as a chest or a crate.  You open it up, take what you need then leave. This will make houses in this game useless if you ever need to take cover in them. I personally wish I could get inside houses when I'm being chased. Getting cornered when hiding behind a giant rektangle is one of the worst ways to die, I imagine. However, this doesn't apply to the aforementioned castletowers.    TL;DR    I like this game. You might not like it. Buy it on a sale. Preferably 75% off. That's what I did.",

            "review_text": "Sir/Madam is a creative and unique approach to stealth-based combat in setting, aesthetics, and gameplay. If you like sneaking past guards, looting buildings, or assassining then you'll probably enjoy this. However if you like replaying 20-30 minute sessions because of the rare save points and punish difficulty, then you'll likely get frusterated very quickly. The goal of the game is to scavenge for goodies, avoid starvation and detection, and find pieces of a mysterious device in a five randomly generated environments.   The biggest problem currently with the Mac verion of Sir is the fairly frequent yet unpredictable crashes every 90-120 minutes. These seem to occur most often in some of the more exotic areas. Being that save points are infrequent, and that there are incentives to not to save often, this gets to be a big problem.  Gameplay-wise the biggest problem is the difficulty. I'm a big fan of high difficulty games, but there is not a large skill ceiling here, so it gets very frusterating even in the early stages. However because of the limited inventory system (and consumable nature of supplies) it is almost impossible to 'defeat' the game by 'snowballing' large amounts of supplies later on, so while Sir is punishly hard from the beginning, it stays consitent until the end.  Another big problem is the most basic enemy type, (which is also the most common enemy type) a bipedal robot with a shotgun. Having a low tier enemy, or a common enemy with shotgun in a stealth-based combat game is very frusterating. The purpose of stealth based combat is to sneak in close proximity to enemies, either to kill them or get to objectives; but if they have a shotguns, then the closer you get the stronger they get. This creates incentives to battle from a larger distance (which isn't viable), or to avoid combat altogether (which also isn't viable). Getting killed in 1-2 shots from full health is can work if it is clearly your fault, and the stealth detection system works well, just not the inability to deal with enemies regularly.  Bandages are also another problem with Sir, being that when you take damage it is possible to start bleeding out until you die. Bleeding can only be stopped by bandages, which are uncommonly found and very rarely dropped by enemies. This makes combat frusterating because even a low-damage, grazing shot on yourself (especially with the abundant shotgun enemies) can be can be lethal if you don't have a bandage. Or if you use your bandage to stop the bleed, only to get another one put on yourself by the next shot.",

Firstly I will state this, I played this game at about 15fps on the smallest window size possible. The text was too blurry to read, the gun was too laggy to aim. Yet despite all that, I enjoyed every single moment of this game. (Note this was because of my laptop's crappy specs, not the fault of the game)  This game looked appauling due to my computer, so I will refrain from speaking about that.  The main robot you find is a sort of stuck up chap, he refuses to speak with anything other than his shotgun. And blast that thing hurts!  And that is the biggest problem I had with the game. However bleeding is calculated, it is too easy to bleed. 90% of my deaths were from bleeding out trying to find a bandage or being murdered trying to apply a bandage. OR applying a bandage but getting shot again and bleeding again!  The next trouble I had was inventory space. It may seem generous when you first start, but when you find a 4x4 sized chunk, you have to clear out so much stuff. AND I DONT WANT TO THROW AWAY MY CROCKERY!  OH Oh oh! Also love the ending music!

Improvising should be something you should always keep in mind while playing. Your butler Walters also helps you get an idea of what you should be doing upon your first time playing. There are a few things that can and WILL screw you over though. Such as the robot's pathing glitching into eachother...on one of the pieces you need to collect. The music (being very well done btw) is a bit of an annoyance. It starts playing when you need to keep your ears open when you've got your face buried in some shrubery and is completely silent when you're being chased.  If you can overlook the small problems/bugs you find in the game then I would say, buy it. you'll get a lot of fun out of it and you won't regret it.

Once you get the basics down, you will find you have stories to tell. And with random, procedurally-generated islands, you can revisit and revisit. And because the game is so open, you can play pretty much however you want to. Tempted to do a 'traps and axes' playthrough next.  Right from the first Alpha build it seemed complete. Everything that's subsequently been added has built upon the experience, in both aesthetics and gameplay. They are pretty much done, now. One more mob to add and one more biome, then a balance.

            "review_text": "Sir, You Are Being Hunted is one of the very few FPS games that actually feels unique. While the gameplay is somewhat limited, with only a handful of different enemies, each of them has a lot of personality, and strenghts and weaknesses that make them very distinct from one another, same goes for the limited number of weapons. The usable items could be more unique... I never found myself using the toy train, or the alarm clock, or the traps at all, as throwing bottles and rocks to draw enemies away from you seemed superior, although you may find better uses for those items than I did.  The game is pretty simple; you start off on the center island, and there are 4 more to explore (N, S, E, W) as you gather all the shards of whatever it is you're collecting that will teleport you off the island to safety. Sneaking around is FAR superior to engaging in combat, which I really found enjoyable, because in real life, you can't stand and have a gunfight with 1 or more other people and not expect to die. The use of the red light emanating from the enemies eyes, as well as their characteristic sounds was perfectly used to help you identify them in the bleak British countryside, as well as build suspense... It's a little difficult keeping your cool and crouching in the weeds while a towering Landowner strolls by, screaming, with hunting dogs swarming around him, waiting to attack and pin you to the ground so others can finish you off with their guns!  I liked that they made building unable to be entered; they would too easily become safe havens against the robots hunting you, and checking them in broad view of passersby while your screen is obscured by the doorways made for some very tense moments... especially knowing that if the big, normally passive robot that patrols them sees you, he'll make very quick work of you with his pistol!  The health and vitality meters worked out perfectly... there are no health restoring items, just food, which you eat to keep your vitality up. This not only prevents you from starving to death (which never happened to me), but the higher your vitality, the more quickly your health regenerates while you hide in the shadows licking your wounds. If you take enough damage, you start to bleed health fairly quickly, and MUST take cover to apply a bandage, even while being fired upon, otherwise you will surely die!  The learning curve of the game is fairly difficult, as you'd expect from a procedurally generated game, but there are infrequent save points that make dying more pallatable; I think the difficulty along with infrequent saving perfectly balanced each other out so that you couldn't be very reckless, as you'd lose a significant amount of progress, while not forcing you to play so conservatively as to completely avoid risks (Nethack, I'm looking at you!). Currently, there's not a huge amount of replay value; the different classes are nearly identical, and all their starting equipment is easily found. I think if they added more classes/items/monsters/weapons/biomes, and made them unlockable by reaching objectives, it would greatly add to the replay value... currently, I can see playing through this game 1-2 times before being completely satisfied with it. Being able to craft some items from the myriads of junk, as well as adding helpful NPCs would also go a long ways.  All in all, I definitely got my $20 worth of fun out of this game; don't hesitate to buy it if it goes on sale! I'm excited for expanded content to come out; more enemies, weapons, unique items, biomes, and player mods could easily take this game from a B/B+ to an A-, maybe even an A!",

Unlike DayZ, you don't get shot on sight, or at least, not often. -Great boat-system, creating multiple areas to go to. -Variety of classes to choose from, which you wouldn't expect in a survival-game.  Cons:  -Sometimes feels unfair; you always have to be on the run. -Not alot of weapons to choose from. -Not really that cheap. I got it during the Autumn Sale for €3.99 (translates to $4.40/3.50 Pounds) -Multiplayer doesn't add much; basebuilding would greatly increase the fun you could have with your friends. -Most of the time, your inventory is stuffed with bottles. aka The loot usually sucks ♥♥♥. -You don't really get anything for taking down robots. -Loot shouldn't just be in houses, this doesn't give you much of a choice of where to go.

If my gameplay strategy becomes 'Run through areas skipping everything, while spam clicking left mouse button on the plot thing' You've made a boring and bad game. While the world is randomly generated and can be immersive with some interested features, the devs ignored requests for a more complex and interactive environment and flatly didn't care during development about doing anything other than getting their rapidly pre-ordered idea 'released'.

SYABH seems to be more or less an outdated looking stealth FPS that we see a lot these days that doesn't offer much of anything new. Also it does not really include any aspects of humor, which was disapointing. The only thing I really enjoyed playing this was the ability to customize the map to my liking, dictating what scenery is located where (though this was really basic and honestly nothing special). The fact that 'looting a house' is like opening a chest in skyrim. You can't even go indoors (it just opens up a menu screen)! No hiding in the houses from baloon riding robotic sirs for me! (which by the way, was one of the few clever ideas to include in the game). Lots of negative reviews say it is fun for the first hour but then gets boring - this is true.

Crikey!  As for gameplay, you'll find mostly anything you'd find in any other so called 'survival' title.  There is food and drinks, but the need for them is only noticed via the ever decreasing vitality meter, which upon reaching zero, also decreases your health.  There are bandages you have to use when shot by robots or hurt somehow, otherwise you'll bleed to death.  There is stealth, which consists in hiding and/or moving silently. That includes not upsetting the wildlife, which will scramble all nearby robots in search for whatever caused the stir.  There are 5 different weapons (at least that I could find): a hatchet (melee), a pistol, a double-barrel shotgun, a bayonet and a rifle, this one very difficult to acquire. There is also a bear trap you can set to catch that distracted robot, or your dinner.   There are also a few items you can use to create a distraction so you can run away, or get the robots over so you can ambush them: a rock, empty bottles, a alarm clock (this one gives you time to hide and prepare before it goes off) and a toy train.  The only good thing it has going for it are the huge open world maps, but frankly, there ain't much exploration to be done. For example, you don't get enter buildings, you just access its inventory screen by interacting with the door.

On top of that, this goal isn't really satisfying and there are no shorter-term quests or anything so you lose track of objectives real quickly.  There are houses and stuff to loot, sure. I started out looting every single one. Then I realized that they are just randomized 'chests' that give you the same garbage items 90% of the time (dead rat, broken plate, moldy bread, a rock). It is super time consuming to just go through one by one and loot every door when the reward is useless. My inventory filled up very quickly.  I got to a new area and finally found a pistol and a hatchet. Great. -Finally- some combat. I found some robots wandering. The combat was awful. Their AI is incredibly bad. You can walk right past them and they will be alerted and see you, but then they will take cover behind a house rendering them useless. They cover from you but end up making themselves do nothing since they are just hiding the whole time. There is no threat there. I ran out of my 6 pistol shots quickly and got bored again.

I managed to find 8 pieces and then was unable to make further progress. I never found any weapons, and only a few bullets.  Objectives: There are 15(?) pickups to find across 5 large islands, and the difficulty escalates with each one. They are not shown on the compass or map (you don't even have a map until you find one). At night(?), glowing will-o'-the-wisps can slowly guide you to them. Or just wander around until you see smoke surrounded by enemies - because the objectives are always surrounded by enemies. You are always forced to sneak up close, then dash in, grab the quest item and start fleeing. The objective items vary in size and can take up up to 1/3 of your inventory space, so you have to leave enough room just in case, to avoid getting screwed as you try to grab the item.  Resources: You find loot in buildings. 90% is garbage, and the rest are either tools or one-use consumables. There is never enough inventory space because items don't stack, and there is barely enough food in the game to cover the most direct route. Scavenging is no longer viable once the difficulty escalates, because you waste more energy sneaking around looking for food.

            "review_text": "This game was on my wishlist for a long time, then it went on sale. This really seemed up my alley--turns out that was mostly the (misleading) trailer. I played through a few hours of mild disappointment, thinking I would just beat it and be done. I had cleared 3 of 5 islands at this point, and had quickly come to expect nothing but more of the same monotonous slog of gameplay from beginning to end.  So I go to the West island and... my boat dock procedurally generated right into a sheer cliff's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. No matter, I shrug it off, as I just finished the mountain island and learned you can jump up about any embankment. At the top of this one was one of the Mysterious Fragments, and some robuts wandering about. HOWEVER, I must have been wearing a stovepipe tophat I was unaware of, as one of them saw me, behind some thick grass hanging off the edge of a cliff. After I use my last marshmellow ammo on them, I sigh and reload. Walking up the dock to bang my head against this, not the first nor last samey, mind-numbing obstacle in this game, a bundle of those robot arms that sprout from water shoot up THROUGH THE DOCK. I decide not to take any evasive action, and the next keys I press are Alt and F4, followed by Delete Local Content. I can't think of a single game that's done this to me, or that I did to it in return. And that was just the straw that broke the camel.  If you are sick of the Tedious Inventory Management trend lately (of course they don't show that in the trailer), and aren't keen on imprecise stealth gameplay in a large smear of mostly empty wasteland, don't pick this up. I wish I could get my money back.",

Wait for more development untill you make a purchase. I may give it another shot if some cons are fixed Thanks for reading and ok sorry i didnt like it no hate in comments",

Sir/Madam, You Are Being Hunted promises that each playthrough is unique, but in my experience not a single playthrough has been unique. You might be looking at the screenshots and saying to yourself 'Hey those robots look pretty good!' and you're right - but nothing else does. I sure hope you like the colors brown and grey, because that's the entire color palate. There are different seeds available, but within 10 minutes you've seen every house or castle or whatever on any given island because there simply aren't enough assets. 'But hey,' you might start, 'this is supposed to be drab and dreaery just like real England!' Aside from being a lame excuse to justify a bad art direction, perhaps that's why no one else makes games set in such boring locals.  Even if you try to ignore the graphics in favor of gameplay, you get a pretty unrewarding stealth game. For starters, the visibility gauge seems arbitrary. I swear I was about 10 meters away from a robot with two pips on the visibility gauge and I got by no problem. Same exact condition 5 minutes later? Instantly spotted. This is only compounded when robots are alerted and you find out they're psychic. And did I mention the combat sucks? You don't start off with any weapons and when you get lucky enough to find one, it feels awful. 'But it's a stealth game!' some fool is going to say. True, it is, but classics like Thief and Deus Ex gave you a bunch of different options to avoid combat that all felt refined AND both games start you off with a weapon that's useful, if only occasionally. If you fire a gun in Sir/Madam, you've already lost, and if you find a hatchet you've already won. It all comes down to RNG, which oddly enough, doesn't mind giving you loads of consumables making the survival aspect a formality.  Eventually you get to experience the horrible checkpoint system. You can save whenever you return one of the stone pieces to the altar and when you go between islands. That's it. Be prepared to run upwards of five minutes just to get back where you died so you can restart again. Did I say run? I meant crawl, because running makes you visible from miles around. Realistic, but not even slightly fun. And with movement comes the weird camera bob/lean. Whenever you move with the keyboard, your character leans in that direction like he just pounded down a six pack. I've never had problems with motion sickness in video games before, but this one makes my head throb.  Multiplayer is the same thing but minus the mechanics. Everyone runs around like it's team death match in unreal tournament and eventually wins through sheer luck. And if you die? Hey no problem just respawn and you don't lose any progress!  I've been looking forward to play this game since it entered Early Access but resisted the temptation. I recently got it as part of a Humble Bundle and I still feel ripped off.",
