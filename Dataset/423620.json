            "review_text": "Hero Defense: huanted Island is a very fun and laid back game...when it wants to be. There are maps that kick your butt and keep you on edge the whole time. This is mostly because your heros are not yet developed enough in their skills and or dont have any good rune sets yet. Soon enough you will sink 20+ hours into the game and be ready to take on the hardest challenges each map has.   While the rewards for some of the maps are..mehh..most of the satisfaction is from finding that right build to inilate the enemys and beat the map. The REAL tand TRUE challenge this game has would be the Survival maps. This is where you will need to try multiple ways to implement what runes to use and when, what heros to build first, which towers to use and then to change later on because they are no longer effective. DO NOT go into a survival game looking to last long if you didnt come prepaired with a few thousand gems to build and rebuild shrines. otherwise you are toast my friend!  I would say MULTIPLAYER is challenging, but only trying to find a game is the challenge. Soo little of people who play, actually play online. There can be many reasons for it, possibly they also gave up trying to find a match and after a few tries they gave up for good. But who knows.  I would reccommend this game to anyone who likes tower defence games as this is one of the better ones there are out there. This is not a perfect 10/10 title, nor do i think it trys to be..but i do feel there are many things planned by the devs in the future (either it be dlc or a sequal) that show this series can indeed one day be a 10/10. Dont get this and expect hundreds of hours of gameplay in the single player modes because you wont get it, unless you have no life and no other games to play...or maybe you think Jane Doe is fine as h3ll...then you just need therapy.  I rate this title 9/10 for createiviaty 7/10 for Depth 6/10 for replayability 9/10 for graphics 8/10 for overall",

But after you bear the 'story' (and it's pretty easily done) there really is no point in continuing to play the game. It just becomes this grind to get xp/gold/daimonds to upgrade your chars/town so you can beat ever level on the highest difficulty. But there is no point in doing it, there is nothing more to unlock and even for a competionist, if feels unrewarding. I can't even be bothered with the achivs since so many of them are tied to multiplayer and some really crazy grinding.  Get it when it's on sale for a few hours of fun. But it's not the new Defense Grid for me.",

            "review_text": "Bretty good defense game. Not so much tower defense since you only control 5 'towers' but it's still fun. You basically have 5 heroes that you level up and equip and move around the map with. It's a refreshing take on the genre, albeit (I think) lacking the sort of player creativity that tower defense games usually have. Each of your 5 towers has a preset purpose and you can't really use them beyond that purpose and be very effective. IE the arrow guy is good at killing vampires, the cleric at skeletons etc. But the RPG elements are cool enough to make up for that lack of 'tower' variety.   Easily recommend a buy at sale price (5$ canadian atm) without any reservations or hesitations. One of the better defense games i've played in the last 5 years.",

The poison consumable that does stop regen doesn't last long enough.

I really enjoyed the game, the hero take on the towers was a lot of fun. There are a lot of different customization options between the runes and skill trees that you can layout your heroes in several different ways.   Only knock I had is that insane could've been a bit harder.",

Awkward panning and zooming. I'm a big fan of tower defense, and this looked like a fresh take, so I am very disappointed to have spent good money here. Maybe they'll put some elbow grease into it and get it right. I like the concept and the graphics enough to come back and check, at least.",

            "review_text": "This game is really shallow in my opinion. Heroes have no triggered special abilities, so mostly it's just placing a hero somewhere and watch him/her shoot stuff. This is really bad, since the reason i like to play action tower defense games is that you get to have a more active role and not just place towers. And with 5 max heroes, that's not even a lot of placing you get to do. To make matters worse each hero is able to do noticeable damage to only one type of enemy, further limiting your options.  The game is also quite grindy. Often you cannot progress to a new level if you don't have enough stars. And how do you get more stars? By re-playing already completed levels on a higher difficulty. And how do you succesfully complete levels at a higher difficulty since the game offers you so few strategic options? By building persistent shrines in those levels with diamonds you have to farm in the game. These shrines are places that increase the power of the hero that is standing on top of it. And can you build these shrines where-ever you want to suit your own favoured strategy? No. There are a few preset places per level where you can build them, so if you previously had your own idea where best to place your heroes, it is now null. And enjoy the completely deterministic passive skill-tree that -wow! - increases the damage and fire rate of your heroes.",
