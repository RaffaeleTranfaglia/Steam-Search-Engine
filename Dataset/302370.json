            "review_text": "I initially gave this game a poor review due to technical bugs. I encountered an error that asked me to insert a disk in order to play, obviously this wasn't possible.  This was caused by installing the game on a computer that did not have an optical drive. With the help of Night Dive, I installed a virtual drive and the game ran fine.   I haven't encountered any of the other problems people have mentioned, so I can only assume that they have been fixed, or are simply isolated issues, or I just lucked out.  With all of that said, Tex Murphy is an acquired taste. Humorous, post-apocalyptic, detective, noir, FMV, et cetera. If you are thinking of buying this, you are probably already familiar with the series. If you are not familiar with the series, you might want to start with some of the earlier entries (but you should probably avoid the first game).",

Later addition: Now the sound works, i followed a thread in the discussion board and installed some codecs. But this installed adware on my system, ... I hope, that the publisher will fix this problem. Until then 'not recommended'.",
