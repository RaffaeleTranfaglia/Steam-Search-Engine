Goal to success is to make mistakes and to learn from them and from the characters, You also have to pay attention to the environment that saves your progress and often use quicksave.   I do not want to say more in order not to spoil your fun  It is highly recommended to player who like Stealth games or the Shogun era.  For those who are unsure, i would recomment a sale event mind you, you need lots of patience otherwise you won` t have fun with this purchase.",

While there are a few skills per character you play I don't feel like there is a need for more. Edit : By now ive finished the game, atleast my first playthrough. already completly hyped for hard mode! the level design is beatiful and you can see (and feel ingame) there has been spent quite some time on it, very well done!  If your afraid of the possible low amount of hours you might spend on it , well I gues its based on person.. but there is quite some replayability. You got night,snow,normal maps combined with always having multiple ways to complete a mission. not one road that loads to victory. Challenges will need you atleast 3 playthroughs to complete. (complete stealth missions no kills , dont touch X , timed runs , dont use X char, etc.) which forces you to play different then you might be used to , fun!  ow yah the story aint bad either,dont expect skyrim/the witcher etc. for its genre its well filled with lore.  The steam page/videos give you not enough insight in my opinion, try the free demo!  Don't pirate this , support the dev's they deserve it =)",

            "review_text": "This is the best isometric stealth real-time tactics game to come around in a while. The missions are challenging and varied and the stages gorgeous. Great Japanese voice acting and an Edo period setting buttress an engaging story with interesting and endearing characters.   The tale begins with a tutorial mission in which one of the five playable characters aids an assault on Osaka castle led by another member of what will become the Shogun's elite team, in order to seize it and install your daimyo as Shogun. You'll then embark on the uncovering and unraveling of a plot against the Shogun after a successful period of his administration.   The story is quite well-written and the setting, art style, and voice acting make it very immersive.   On the gameplay side, I've often been amazed at how long I've spent on a level, after observing, planning, executing, and retrying even seemingly small engagements in order to get them right in what are often very small exploitable windows of time requiring instantaneous coordination between two or more of the five playable characters. Thankfully, there's a 'shadow mode' during which you can queue up actions for each character before hitting 'enter' to watch them be carried out simultaneously.  As to downsides, I haven't found many. It can be quite challenging at times, but not so much in an 'RNG' way that feels unfair. Every problem has at least one solution, and almost all appear to have multiple, so if you stick with it and plan patiently you'll succeed. Names and details of the Edo period setting have been changed, so you're not serving Tokugawa Ieyasu as such, but this isn't a historical simulator and the details that are present more than suffice to make the story and gameplay immersive. I have encountered a few areas in which I can do things I clearly shouldn't be able to, such as knock out a civilian on a balcony and then throw her down between two buildings in an area with no visible gap, where she then gets stuck and can no longer witness my systematic dispatching of the guards. The loading times for the first playthrough of a new mission can sometimes take up to about 120 seconds, but this is a one-time inconvenience. In fact, I'd say the game is optimized very well as I'm running on a graphics card (Radeon HD6870) that sits below that of the minimum recommended system requirements (HD7750) and am able to run the game on high-max settings with no performance issues.  Although I'm still only on my first playthrough, that the replay value is high is immediately obvious, with each level having multiple paths to the objective(s), and several challenges per level ranging from unique environmental kills to extremely difficult time hacks for speedruns. This game will give back a lot of fun hours of play for its fairly modest price tag. If you enjoyed games like those from the  Commandos  series, are interested in Edo period Japanese history, or both (like myself), you won't regret this purchase in the slightest.  9/10 Highly recommend!",

            "review_text": "Oh boy, overall, this game is a stunning masterpiece. I have so much to say about this game, but let's narrow it down to a few points.   Starting with the positive aspects: - Storyline,   Amazing   13/10. I personally loved the story. It is undescribable, especially at around the climax. - gameplay, a huge variaty of strategies even when the game is based on stealth. The developers created the obstacles, and the rest is for you to overcome them however you want. - hints, the game provides you with key objects/locations as hints to help you get through a level that you may be stuck on. - difficulty, this game is generally difficult for me when I played on normal difficulty, it required alot of thinking and strategy, which is the exact reason why I found myself coming back to this game everyday.  - voice acting, the voices of the characters are well-designed, not just the protagonsists but also the enemies. It really puts a sense of reality in the game.   For some negative points I came across: - there are some glitches of enemies where they would become 'stuck', making it impossible for me to get through a chokepoint unnoticed because they wont look away - controls, this is just a personal opinion, I find it a little annoying when I try to click on the ground beside a hook ring and my mouse snaps onto the hookring instead of my actual target.   It is important to note for reference that it took me 25 hours of gameplay to beat this game on a first playthrough on normal difficulty. There are 9 achievements for each of the 10 levels to be completed in alternative playthroughs. Personally I don't feel like going back to complete them but I'm certain this is a good concept for players who likes challenges.",

            "review_text": "This has been practically ALL I have wanted to do since I bought it, borderline all I have thought about at work, and been the biggest source of regret for when I have to go to bed (because 'adult responsibilities' and 'mortgage' or whatever). I saw it out of nowhere because Steam insidiously knows what I like, and I took the shot and man am I glad I did.  The gameplay is amazing. It's real time stealth tactical, so you have five dudes (once you get everybody), a classic ninja (throws shuriken, stabs people up real good, can make enemies look a certain direction with a stone throw), a thief (sets traps, stabs people up real good, can draw people to a spot with a bird whistle), a samurai (is the only dude who can fight enemy samurai one-on-one, stabs people up real good, and has a whirlwind slash that can take out all enemies in a small circular area), a kunoichi (does disguises to hide in plain sight/talk to guards to distract them, stabs people up real good, and has a sight-diminishing tech that reduces enemies vision cones briefly), and a sniper (crippled and so can't climb walls or use grappling hooks, but stabs people u-- er, fills people fulla holes real good, can do bombs, and has a startlingly performance-capable tanuki for complex kiting maneuvers to get enemies away from their buddies to facilitate being stabbed up real good).   Everybody has unique talents, and what's really cool is you'll likely find some combination that fits your preferred playing style. I stuck with the shinobi and thief most, because pulling people into a knife-launching spring trap, hucking a shuriken into one dude's throat and then stabbing his attendant in the space of about one-point-four seconds is immensely satisfying. That said, you could just as easily take the kunoichi and the sniper, and have her distract one of the guards watching the target while he puts a bullet in his head from a tower four hundred yards away. Go nuts. Or don't kill anyone and ghost your way through the levels if you're one of those non-stabbing weirdos society keeps talking about.  The levels get pretty huge, and it's honestly daunting in the later ones. While 13 levels may not sound like a lot, each of them took me an average of an hour and change (longer when I deliberately choose to hunt the enemy population to extinction); the last level literally took me two and a half hours. And the first 20 MINUTES was just looking at all the dudes and trying to find a weak link.  I'll grant, this brings me to my ONE major complaint, and it didn't keep me from enjoying it, but it was annoying: the enemy layouts are SUPER manufactured. It doesn't take long for it to start, it just gets more and more compounded as time goes on; everybody is being watched by somebody. Even enemies that move are perfectly synched up with other dudes so that someone is always keeping an eye on them, and murdering someone takes a second (go figure). Enemy vision cones have a hashed region where, if you're crouching, they can't see you there, and if a corpse is on the ground there, fine, but they take so long to fall over, enemies WILL twig that Dave is clearly spurting blood from his carotid just before he finally keels over and alert the whole damn castle. It can honestly get ridiculous in later levels where enemy vision cones are so insanely large that you'll watch a dude for ten minutes, making sure he's isolated enough to take down, so you take down the guy HE'S watching, who's watching and being watching in turn by those two dudes in the courtyard, finally make a move, and then some random jackass will see it from honestly two-hundred-and-change yards. It can really get infuriating. But on the upside, this forces you to utilize the five characters' worth of skills you have in creative ways. You don't so much find a weak link in the chain of enemies so much as MAKE one by employing a strategy and a BIT of save-scumming.   Okay, to be honest, you're going to wear the print off your F5 and F8 keys. But it's quick enough and you adapt quickly that moves you'd never think possible hour 2 only take an extra try or so to pull off. And holy ♥♥♥♥, it feels good. Shadow Mode comes in pretty heavily there; it lets you queue up one action per character and it'll all fire off the second you hit Enter. It's genuinely Rube Goldberg-esque, only with more flying fatality and pointy bits going into people.  The English voice acting is more than competent; player characters sound a little better, but that's not surprising. Gonna do another playthrough with it set to Japanese out of nothing more than curiosity, but I really dig the sound design. Effects are cool, too. I love the whisk-sklurtch of Hayato's shuriken. Satisfying in a way I'm not sure is entirely socially-acceptable.  Only other complaint I had, and it's a tiny one, is that since you have free-camera control, it's possible to have locations of different elevation between your camera and the point you're clicking on, so the game with think you're trying to move onto the roof of a tower nearby, when you're clicking on a point further down the road your selected character is on, and your character won't move, instead voicing protest that the whole 'ninja can teleport' myth is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This gets frustrating when you get blindsided by a patrolling dude going 'HEY IS THAT A HITMAN OVER THERE' (enemies spotting you has a yellow wave slink up the green of the cone and if it hits your character, you're spotted) and you tell Aiko '♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ MOVE MOVE MOVE' and she just goes 'I CAN'T DO THAT; ♥♥♥♥'S SAKE IT'S THREE STORIES UP' because your camera had the curtain wall of the castle sort of in the cursor's way and you get spotted and hit F8 and sullenly correct your rotation again before retrying the maneuver. VERY minor issue, but it IS there. On the upside, it'll teach you how to enter enemy sight ranges just long enough to get from A to B, because if you get out before the warning wave hits you, you're fine. When you're really good, you can 'surf', sticking juuuuuuust on the edge where their normal vision diminishes to half-vision (the hashed region) and you can move with them to move between patrols. It's really tight.  Story's genuinely neat. Stuff happened that I didn't see coming and it was well-written and didn't feel cheap. That alone qualifies it as good story to me. I also liked being assassins for the established government instead of the cliche' 'the ruler is bad we need to kill him because rebels are automatically purer of heart'. I prefer being a government assassin, which I can't say I've been able to do since the Morag Tong in Morrowind. ♥♥♥♥, I should play Morrowind again.  Anyway, I can't say enough good about it. There were times where I was fuming and hammering the quickload keys multiple times a minute (it auto-cycles a set of three saves, which is a ♥♥♥♥ing godsend; reflexively hitting F5 to save and getting blindsided won't ruin your run), but I never ragequitted, and bad moods were always superseded by joy and fulfillment at finding a way around the AI trying to give itself all the advantages to your detriment. There were times I was really thirsty for a pause button, ala Pillars of Eternity, for instance, but that would defeat the purpose, I get it. You adapt surprisingly quickly, and it's a really rewarding game to be good at.  I know I'm biased because I immediately start frothing at the mouth when someone says 'There's ninjas', but this could be Street Bum Simulator and if it was written this well and played this engagingly, I'd still love the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.  It's just better with ninjas.  9.7/10.",

            "review_text": "First things first, let me make one thing clear... although alot of reviewers call this a RTS, it most definately is not, Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is a TACTICS game remeniscent of the old Commandoes and Desperados games. If you are looking for an actual RTS you won't find it in this game.  You control up to 5 characters, each with different skills to complete your task often needing them to work in tandem (wich there is a gamemechanic in place for) and it's a blast to pull off a well planned move with multiple characters at once.  The missions are pretty interesting and they fit around the story that enfolds. I personally saw the plottwist in the story comming a mile away but it still didn't take away anything from the overall experience since the most enjoyment will be from the actual gameplay.  I have spent 31h to complete one playthrough, and there definately is replayability either to get badges (challenges) by doing/not doing certain actions during missions or by simply trying out a another route to your target.  This game is a prime example of a cheap indie games just stomping on most AAA titles in terms of value, fun and gameplay.  I can't really say anything negative about the title based on what it sells for and what it is intended to be. The few quirks I had with it like missing hotkeys for selecting all characters at once, some ui annoyances etc have all been patched in as of writing this review.  So I can't recommend this enough if you are into tactics games. I'm glad atleast one game in this genre is made and I really hope for more.",

            "review_text": "Wow! Not only was this an amazingly well-designed and enjoyable game, it was also a fantastic experience. After playing XCOM: Enemy Unknown, I was thirsty for more strategy-based games. Aside from Invisible, Inc. and Steamworld Heist, I had no other experience with these types of games. After seeing a review for Shadow Tactics on YouTube by a reviewer by the name of ACG (Angry Centaur Gaming), it piqued my interest. Steam was accommodating enough to host a Demo. It was definitely strategical. It took me almost 2 hours for just the first mission! The demo was enough to prompt me to purchase the entire game at a slight discount (15% off I think).  The game is classified as real-time strategy, as opposed to turn-based strategy. This is the main difference from the aforementioned games - it is free-flowing, and can get quite intense! It has a compelling story based in the Japanese lore of Shogun dynasties and the wars waged to protect them. Below is my list of pros and cons:  Pros: - Brilliant level design - devs meticulously crafted these levels to exploit each game character's skill, in turn, tediously forcing the player to explore every action. This is a hardcore strat game, don't be fooled. But, when you complete a level (and the game), it's oh so rewarding! - Graphics are stupendous. With a decent gaming rig, this game runs like butter when in play (see save / load comments in cons). The title screen, alone, is almost worth a quarter-price of admission! - Fantastic characters (5 + 1/2 - the racoon:)) with subtle nuances to personality, suggesting a rich back-story. With this comes a unique set of skills for each that require the player to master. - Voice acting and narration were cinema quality - bravo to the devs! - Score was swelling and breath-taking - like much of the graphical view.  Cons: - As I stated, the game runs silky smooth when in play. The load times and saves (quick or manual) get bogged over time. The game encourages savescumming with a little timer announcing the last save. Again, the game is a beast of a challenge, so you'll need to save...and save often! I read a number of threads re. these load and save times, and found it was most likely due to the way I have the game installed. I have the main game on my HDD, while Steam is on my SSD boot. Games, by default, use the Steam drive for saves. I believe, as I accrued almost 3-4GB of saves, the interplay between the game on the HDD and the save SSD in collaboration with the Steam server and cloud sync, caused the load and save times to suffer. So, I moved a good portion of my old saves to another drive to clear up my SSD drive...this seemed to speed the load times to within 10 seconds and save times to within a couple seconds. It's kind of a minor thing, but finding the silly save files was kind of like finding a needle in a haystack. For future players, Steam games typically store save files in Users/&lt;your name&gt;/AppData/Local/&lt;game folder&gt;. The tricky part in locating it was that the folder was titled 'Daedalic Entertainment GMBH' - the dev. - Because each level is so intricate and loaded in entirety, the control of the camera to angle that perfect strategy can be a bit cumbersome, but nothing show-stopping.  If you have time and patience to invest, and want a challenge unlike most other contemporary games, at least try the demo. Each level took me an average of 2-3 hours to complete - at least that's what the game stats showed; however, it was most likely longer because of all the savescumming. Honestly, this game embodied the epitome of what video games should be - strategic, cognitively challenging, enthralling story, engaging characters, amazing play mechanics and more! Again, try the demo.",

I am going to write Pros and Cons about it and hope you find them enough to get an idea about this game.  Pros  * Excellent story. * Amazing characters. * Rewarding gameplay, requires you to think and make a strategy. * Great voice acting, some short conversations take place during missions that are really fun to listen. * A variety of tools available at your disposal to plan your approach, makes it fun and creative at the same time. * Great level design and locations. * Beautiful and crisp visuals set in feudal Japan. * Perfect controls with Mouse and Keyboard, making us PC gamers feel at home. * Nice attention to animations. * Good music. * Respectable amount of graphic customization. * Very well optimized, playing it at max settings 4K DSR.  Cons  * Maybe short in length and that's what killing me already, don't want this game to end ever. * Could have a few more characters, it's not a con really but a desire to see more excitting characters.

If you ever played and enjoyed Commandos, this is a no brainer pick up spiritual successor. If you have no idea what Commandos is, you can find out what you've been missing out on for free with the lengthy demo and make a choice from there, hopefully discover a great genre you may have missed out on since it's been pretty much dead for awhile until this game came out.

I enjoy writing about games, I enjoy playing them, etc...  So what is there to be said about Shadow Tactics, welp, i've heard plenty of people have compared this game to the 'Commandos' video game series, altho I cannot really vouch for this comparison, nor defy it, given the fact that i've never played the game, so many people have said it tho, that I might take their word for it and just simply say that this game is like a modern version of that series.  But really what I mostly enjoy about the game, besides the fact that simply this game is unique in every way, it's the simple fact that the game looks, sounds, and plays, beautifully, the game has this very distinctive cel shaded look to it, balanced with a lot of color, and a lot of detail, pair that with multiple video options, and you don't only have a pretty game, but also an optimized game at that.  The sound is nice, you can choose between multiple dialog options, as well as change the actual spoken language from english to japanese, or vice-versa, it's great really, i've been so far playing this game with the Japanese spoken voice, but with english subtitles, it adds (in my opinion) an amazing atmosphere besides the one that the game already creates with it's aesthetic.  The gameplay its really where its at for this game, the strategy and multiple abilities that your characters have are amazing, diverse, and unique in their usefulness, all of your characters share the basic core rulesets that the game has, but all of them also serve multiple purposes, so you can have in one mission a character who's an sniper, while in another you can have a character that can plant traps and climb through the rooftops of some buildings, it all works well, so far, it's enjoyable, and most importantly, it encourages a methodical and inteligent way of playing the game.  And an inteligent and methodical way of playing the game is right to say, the game it's incredibly challenging and puts an enourmous ammount of attention to 'trial and error' style of play, up to a point where there's a reminder to quick save your game that starts after a minute after the last quick save, a useful mechanic, some might say a bit annoying, but I say after playing, incredibly useful and necessary at that, you can however, if you want, disable the warning, as well as a whole other bunch of hud elements, as I said before, it is an incredibly optimized game for pc, in every use of the word, it doesn't only run well, it has multiple options through which you can customize your game so it can be the experience that your choosing to play.  So far I frankly don't regret my decision, having bought this game with a 10% discount, its just fine by me, I do believe that the people should wait for a while before purchacing this title, but that's just my recommendation.  Overall I really have enjoy what i've played so far, and I do recommend the game based on simply what i've experienced after playing for three hours, having completed three missions.",

This game is different, it has great setting, story and characters. Graphics are good and tention you feel while you are playing and trying not to be seen by soliders is really what keeps you wanting to play more.  I would not mind seeing expansion to this game and would probably buy it as well.",

The only caveat I'd give is that it is quite unforgiving; I personally don't see that as a negative what-so-ever, but the game will require you to save often and think hard about how to tackle situations with the appropriate finesse.  This is a genre of games that I'd largely forgotten about, but after playing Shadow Tactics all I want is more.  Hightly recommended.",

As a long time fan of Commandos, Desperados and Robin Hood: Legend Of Sherwood, I really enjoy this game. It's pretty much exactly what those games were, but in a different setting and on a newer engine. This genre has been dead for far too long, and I am so glad it's back!  The graphics work very well, gameplay is smooth. Not a single crash yet, and I have only noticed one minor bug (Patrol--&gt;ladder--&gt; Yuki's trap). The story is okay, good enough but nothing special. A big plus for the quick-save timer, it has saved my ♥♥♥♥ plenty of times.",

If you`re old enough to remember Commandos series, and you liked them - this is a nobrain instabuy for you. If that reference doesn't ring a bell, then it is a great example of stealth tactical genre games, which i advice you to try!   It even has a demo, god damn it! How many devs today make demos? Pure awesomeness, thats how the games should be done! The Games, i'd even say!",
