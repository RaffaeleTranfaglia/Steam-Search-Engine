Turn on the original parser for a minute. Then tell your father you're happy to live in the future, thank you very much.  Either way, with the updated graphics and interface it's a solid adventure game you both can enjoy.",

            "review_text": "This game has several dialogue issues of all kinds. The voice acting sounds stilted and forced. The text parser is bad, much worse than the original. With the price of this remake you'd think they would have fewer issues and improved more than just the graphics. Not at all worth the price, even at the 50% off I paid for it.  If you reallly want it, wait for an 80% off sale. That would be close to the actual value of this game.",
