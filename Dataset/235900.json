            "review_text": "A simple yet efficient way to create your own RPG. It is very user friendly and easy to understand. It has vast customization options, but is limited in some ways. The only things to irritate me so far are tilesets being limited and hard to make, and graphics being tedious to make and put in. Other than that this program is amazing. You don't need any knowledge or expierence in coding. It's straight foward and has advanced coding for the more knowledgable users (which sadly I'm not one of them.) I have spent 9 hours so far on my game and am ust now getting the first quest arc finished (which is only maybe 15-30 minutes gameplay time depending on how well you play.) So if you plan to use it be prepared for your time to be consumed and for you to be sucked into your own creation.  You can also remake Pokemon if you want. 9/10",

            "review_text": "Overall, I'm content with RPG Maker XP, however my main grievance is that multiple times, it's suddenly lost all compatability for my project. My main example is that I had been working for probably a week and a half on a game and I was really feeling it. The game would be actually good. I booted up my computer, opened up RPG Maker XP, and suddenly I got an error and just lost all my work. That's probably an outlier of a situation. Overall, it's easy to use and offers a lot for its' pricetag. Very much worth it.",

Don't let my limited playtime fool you, I used it a lot before it was available on steam (60 to 100 hours or so).",

Without any promo there is no sense in spending such amount of money, especially because you can't monetize this game without buying special stuff as I remember. There are no tutorials on steam, hard to find some help. You will also have to modify this game a bit to start creating nicer cities, spots.",

Like others have said, the way layers works in this version is a lot better that the auto layers in VX.  There may not be as many resources but it doesn't really matter.  Resources can be created an imported anyway.  Spend so much time on this just creating one game (which isn't even half finished yet) and I don't mind cause it's fun.  It can be a bit difficult to understand at first for newcomers to rpg maker but there are good tutorial videos on youtube and some of the stuff is self-explanatory anyway.",
