            "review_text": "I have been playing this game on android for about two years now. So I might be a bit biased. In that time, I have been ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d, naked, embarrassed, disappeared into the night worrying all my friends, met new people, madeout with said people, had a slap contest, and just made a whole bunch of super memories, that I sometimes have trouble remembering.  The game goes like this: 1. gather friends and alcohol 2. there is this awkward atmosphere at the beginning of the night so you suggest playing king of booze 3. everyone hates you by they play along 4. since the game always gives you a choice between challenges and drinking, everyone chooses to drink because they are all lazy monkey butts 5. everyone is tipsy now and they start doing challenges and having actual fun 6. the alcohol is now gone and everyone is sleeping, wasted or making out  This formula works really really super well. Would definitely recommend for every awkward gathering.  And kudos to the developers for adding a professional touch to the game. A CLOCK. Yup, the thing that tells time. It's in the game. It might sound stupid, but when you're predrinking and have to be somewhere after, it saves lives.",
