Most are going to get this game with a coupon for 10 cents as I did. Is this game worth the 1 Dollar? If you like first person shooters that will frustrate you to point of having to look up how to complete a level, then yes it is. When you buy this game remember that you are going to pay either a dollar or less and you will get a game that you will beat within 2 hours, are the guns underpowered? Not really they do the right amount of damage for the enemies. Is the music too loud? To start the game yes but most games are so you can turn it down with windows or whatever OS you are using and you willl be fine as the gameplay audio scales with the music.The things I liked most about the game is the fact that each level is different, with a new set of challenges. You have to move swiftly to get to your gun or you are being swarmed by enemies. It will frustrate some but this is no excuse for a negative review. I would definitely recommend this game for the price.",

If you are above 13 and are buying this for yourself, don't bother unless it's on sale and you plan on making money back through card drops (as I have).  Note: I've only played 6 minutes and got halfway through the game while getting a good feel for the game. It's a really simple and easy game.",

I will admit I had fun playing this game, but the developers took many lazy shortcuts and published a half-finished alpha demo  Out of 10:  Gameplay - 7.5 Environment - 3 Level design - 2  Animation - 8 Art/Design - 2  Code/Optimization- 5  Gameplay is fairly fun, and the designer definitely had a cool idea going with the blocky environment, but this was just poorly executed. Many models in the game just don't match the art style, such as the grey tunnels. The font and GUI was poorly done. Lots of little things such as the FX when your bullet hits an enemy, you can see the borders of the png image they used. I could go on with endlessly listing little things this game needs, but you should really just buy it for yourself, since the game is only 20 cents. I would rate this negative, but I cannot complain since this game is practically free.  If you are a Game developer: Buy this game, and take note of everything that was sloppily done, and use them as a bad example for making your own game.    ",

            "review_text": "Decent but oft frustrating game where you run around pixelated platforms and hallways smacking down bit alien zombies with baseball bats, guns (and actually that is all I have used lol). It features simple k/m controls (WASD, Space, and M1/M2). It's really that basic. However, as you advance, the platforms tend to fall away behind you, so strategic retreats become quite limited without you falling to your death. It uses a basic point health system...you have 100, the creatures tend to have more. The game actually looks pretty cool, and the gameplay such as it is works perfectly. I have encountered no bugs or the like. So, while there isnt a whole lot to this game, it is a nice distraction and for the sub twenty cent price point it often features (with trading cards that allow you to make back your investment), this is a title I expect to see in pretty much every Steam Library.  This is a 6 out of 10 for me, but for the trading card budget titles, this is actually one of the better ones out there.",

But... the only downside is that it is way waaay to short.

            "review_text": "This game is ok, not perfect, not horrible just ok. The last few levels are really REALLY frustrating with the scaling of difficulty being off. I believe the fifth level to be harder than the sixth.   Controls are pretty good, I am able to freely control my character wherever I need to except you can't manipulate your jumps in air so if you make a bad jump, you can't correct yourself and it's back to the begining of the stage with you.  The levels are ok but some are panfully long and if you mess up at the very end, you have to start all the way at the beginning of the stage except for the last stage which is broken up into segments. If there were checkpoints in the stages, I wouldn't be so upset about dying over and over to something over and over again. Also when the enemies die, they leave segments of their body lying around. THIS can lead you to get stuck and take unintended hits from other enemies which can kill you and force you to start the stage. This is highly apparent in Test 8 where you can't jump over any of their body segments and when there's ten plus enemies on your butt, then it gets really frustrating when there's nothing you can do to prevent yourself from dying. Again, checkpoints would be great for the long stages. Another additon that would make the game better would be a sprint option.   Your movement speed is kind of on the slow side and for some reason, when you look up or look down, your movement speed is decreased. Why is this I would never know but it's stange and can lead to you getting swarmed by enemies because you can't move fast enough to get away from them. If there was a sprint button, then you could get away from swarms and feel safer but also risk running into obstacles that could instantly kill you as the risk vs. reward option.  Although some of the stages are really long, the game itself is really short. I beat all the stages in less than two hours and that's with Alt tabbing out of the game to check some other things while the game was running. While dying over and over again can be frustrating, what isn't frustrating is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is really good on the ears and can go well with what is being thrown at you in the stages. Beating the game gives you the sound test so you can listen to all the songs at your leasure.  For the price (under one dollar at the time of this review) I believe you're getting your money's worth. The game is harmless and can be fun but at the same time really frustrating. The game is worth it in my opinion because it's really cheap and you're getting a decent, although somewhat frustrating, experience in the long run. If anything it's worth it for the soundtrack alone.  Pros: Smooth control  Awesome music Cons: Frustrating enemy design  No checkpoints for really long stages  Short (Only nine levels)  Score: 3/5 Bare in mind you get what you pay for.",

The game is challenging to the point where it makes you very frustrated! The mouse/camerawork is a little sketchy and you cannot disable mouse acceleration, so if this bothers you, then you may not want to play this game. The gun mechanics are pretty good. Dying is very frustrating, as you will start over and there are not checkpoints, so those hardcore parkour levels really irritate me. There sis not much more to be said about this game.

You won't believe the incredible story line. It is riveting and full of suspense! Every Test is a testament to true surprise and storytelling. Our hero, Quilly will lead you on a non-stop adventure of having no idea what is going on 100% of the time.  Armed with your automatic rifle, a shotgun not worth shooting and a toothpick of doom; you will face aliens, bad terrain, zombies, horrific terrain, golems, and did I mention, bad terrain? This small adventure may be too large for our MS Paint hero, Quilly as he takes on the Tests designed by the aliens who captured him.  In all seriousness: If you're looking to kill time and don't mind a game that makes little to no sense, Dead Bits fits the bill. You will be challenged in your ability to only tap the space bar to jump, to aim with no crosshairs, and to predict where the mobs are actually standing when you shoot/bash at them.   Also, expect to die for no reason 90% of the time...  Recommended? Yes Pay full price? OH HELL, NO!",

For about 1/10th of that, you not only get an hour or two of fun with shooting and hitting blocky monsters, but you actually can make money off of playing the game.

It's a simple game which doesn't have too many or distracting things as a whole. While hard at times it's a fun little game to play around with and experiment with. A mix of FPS and largely parkour elements mashed together create this game, and the graphics aren't too 'shiny' to distract you all the time (Like with triple A games).  Oh and reviewers, keep this in mind before you rant, it's an indie game made by a small company, not a million bucks triple A title, so don't expect mega awesome stuff.  Altough i do have some complaints (Like how some bosses are too difficult to kill or some levels are a bit too hard or that you can fall off the map a bit too easy.) I also have quite some compliments for this game.  Overall I'd give this game a 4/5. It could use some improvements but besides those the game feels simple yet fun to play with.",

The game is fun, but hard. The game has trading cards. So if you get it super cheap you can even re-buy the game.  You can also call it entertaining Arcade feeling.  Cons: The game is kinda short.

I needed something to prevent me from suicide. I could not find anything I really liked. I tried buying toys, but the store clerks always prevented me from buying anything because I was overweight. I tried making a vlog on YouTube about my troubles, but I was banned from youtube for supposedly impersonating Gabriel Iglesias. Google fined me all of my money until I only had $1.10 left.  The only things I had were things necessary for my survival. I was fed a potato every other day and also given water in a shot glass. Sometimes I forced myself to use the water as a way to bath instead of drinking it. I was locked in my room every day cuz my parents were busy fighting about which console to play on. Well, not entirely.  I had this netbook, one my parents got me for my birthday when I was 12. I used it for school, mostly, until now. I was also lucky enough to have a charger, and all the stuff you need to use the netbook. I decided, maybe give video games a try. No one would judge me there. I was unable to play the f2p games because A. They took too much storage and B. I would be banned whenever I joined a multiplayer game. I remembered the $1.10 I had left.  I knew I had to find something that gave me a reason to live. I looked through the steam store. Jesus almost nothing was $1.10! I was about to give up and just end my life when I found this game. Dead Bits . 99 cents, without 10% tax. It took up all the space on my netbook. After waiting for it to download, I opened up the game. Upon opening it up there was a well made launcher with many options. Once I opened up the actual game, I heard a sweet soundtrack, and saw some badass looking aliens and a cool human. Was this what I needed to continue living?  It was. I am proud to say Dead Bits saved my life. The characters were deep, had personality, and I was able to connect with them. The story was unique, suspenseful, and I shed multiple tears. The graphics were revolutionary, and the soundtrack was the first good thing I had heard in awhile. It, in a way, provided everything I needed to live. The characters were my friends. The game was like a good parent. The game was easy to fap to. I could have just played the game for my entire life. It was amazing. It changed me. Here I am, sitting in my room, now infested with bullet ants and bees, starved half to death and with my throat about to dry up. But you know what? I do not care. Because I have Dead Bits. And I will always have Dead Bits. This game is my life now. I am finally happy. I am finally free. I know now the meaning of life. And only because Microblast games spent their time on this godly game.   its ♥♥♥♥.",

Quite honestly one of the best experiences I have had the opportunity to ever lay my hands upon.  What IS Dead Bits? I am glad you asked.  For those perplexed at the mechanics behind this outstanding gem, you enter the world with no knowledge of the lore, or the people. Soon after you start playing the very first mission, a wonderful sensation enthralls you. The eye-catching graphics, the beautiful and yet mysterious musical soundtrack, and the compelling NPC's you meet along the way all come together in this riveting story of an avenging redemption.   Now, I acknowledge that only 200 hours is nothing compared to the world you can explore throughout this tale, however, I am drawn to it's everlasting elegence. I feel the need to create this review as to help others come to the conclusion that they too need to purchase this title.  Dead Bits has definitely helped me overcome my serious anxiety issues, both with family members and females. I believe what I have accomplished has been a great success towards becoming a better person. I am looking forward to the many hours that await me in this gripping world, and they await you too.",

Good luck shooting enemies when you're falling to your death by backing up every couple seconds. -Unlimited ammo, so forget any form of tactical shooting, spraying and praying is fully encouraged. Taking away any challenge from the actual COMBAT. -The sounds are in the wrong places. I'm running outside and I hear the echoing as if I'm inside a cave. I enter a tunnel, and it sounds like I'm outside. -Too short. I guess the dollar price tag COULD make that acceptable, but I pay $20 for games that get me 100+ hours of gameplay. That's a maximum of 20¢ per hour, this game is charging you $1 for 20 minutes worth of missions (If even that much.) That's a ripoff.  -The music is an edgy teen's dream. Instead of picking a quality soundtrack the developer kindly picked WUBWUBWUBBWAA instead. It sounds like frogs are screaming at me throughout the entire game.

            "review_text": "Dead Bits is an arcade FPS where you are apparently trying to gain your freedom by shooting things while walking backwards in between bouts of pointless platforming.   The intro level seems fine enough. Here's a gun, shoot those guys, watch them explode in a mess of cubes. Ok, this could be fun to mess around with. That feeling quickly fades once you start going through the monotony of the following levels. Enemies essentially consist of kamikaze monsters that run straight at you with reckless abandon. They swing wildly and miss as you circle strafe around them, but the game throws a red puff on your screen indicating you've been hit anyway. That leaves the strategy to walking backwards and killing the enemies as they filter toward you. But wait just one second, because some levels make the ground behind you magically disappear causing you to back into your death.    And death is so much fun. There are no checkpoints and every death kicks you back to the level select screen, because who doesn't want to reselect and reload the same level constantly? Of course, if you like reselecting and reloading the same level you are going to love this...platforming! Very few games do first person platforming well, and this is clearly not one of them. One section has you jump from disorienting spinning cube to disorienting spinning cube. Fun times. There are also moving platforms that for some reason, even when you are standing on them, don't move you. So you have to actually walk with the platform as it moves toward your destination.  The gunplay in this is also rather poor. The weapons are bland and boring and pack no punch. The smg sounds more like a typewriter than a firearm. Occasionally a kill will trigger a slo-mo moment. Unforunately, it's not the kind like Killing Floor that allows you to pull off a couple quick headshots, but the kind where everything just slows down around you for a couple seconds and then you carry on. The melee weapon is a frustrating tool you are forced to use due in part to poor hit detection using it, and the aforementioned poor hit detection when enemies swipe at you. Your best bet is to creep toward enemies slowly and stopping as soon as you pull one, since enemies only start their kamikaze attack once you reach a certain distance threshold. But by creep I don't mean use the crouch button. It's there and entirely pointless.  The concept of the game seems decent on the cover, but the execution leaves much to be desired and I wouldn't recommend it. If you want to walk backwards and shoot things play Serious Sam.",

You can get it for free from other websites, which saves you a dollar. In its essence, Dead Bits is an FPS. Its quality is at the same standard as a first year student game, which leads me to believe it is.  This game got on Steam through Greenlight, as with many games, good or bad. Dead Bits falls onto middle ground. It is not a bad game in playability but a bad game in everything else. It works, but the only entertainment I found was boring. After a while, it gets repetitive, and because of that I never actually beaten the game. However, from the experience I have had, I would honestly suggest passing on this, even if free, and playing some other game. There are plenty out there from indie developers that are being worked on and that are free.",

I would honestly rather play Superman 64 while somebody holds a shotgun to my jaw.  The gameplay is terrible.  You can beat the first 5 levels in under 10 minutes.  Notice how I said first 5? Yeah, after level 5 the game becomes insanely difficult.  Level 6 is a fire level where you are completly unarmed for the entire mission until you reach the end using the game's horrible jumping physics, after which you get an SMG. Shortly after, a boss spawns with easy to destroy projectiles. And then he picks up speed to the point that it's impossible to dodge. By then he's sitting on top of you because you can't look straight up. If you DO manage to beat him, you get sent to level 7.  Level 7 is the last level I played before being 100% done with this game. You get the most inaccurate laser gun I've ever seen in a video game, an then your dropped on a narrow pathway with 2 UFOs with 1000 health EACH. After killing those you get sent to a Sonic the Hedgehog esque half-pipe like the special levels from Sonic 2. And there are little spiky things that insta-kill you if you touch them, making you go aaaaall the way back to the start. AND THEY'RE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID.

While amateurish, the developer clearly had at least a basic grasp of game design, and there was a lot of variety in the challenges. It wasn't a straight-up FPS, it was sometimes a platformer, sometimes an FPS, and sometimes a 'hit-things-with-a-bat game'. It combined all of them at certain points too, which I think is where it really shined.  Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it. The game is rather difficult, in spite of the simplistic AI, mostly due to the challenges being laid out like an endurance gauntlet. Now, I like gauntles, they're fun, but the stages are pretty long and there's a distinct lack of checkpoints. After retrying the sixth stage around four times, I just couldn't be bothered to run through again. The amateurish game design and intentionally harrowing first person platforming are tolerable and even enjoyable at first, but on repeat runs they become annoyances. It's a real shame, too, because with even a semi-generous checkpoint system, I would've had a pretty good time.",

The menus are simplistic, though passable. The lack of a choice of resolution or individual graphics quality options is absolutely unforgivable, as is the lack of key rebinding. Also, did I mention mouse accel?  Also for some reason each stage requires that you press your Return key before it actually starts, as if the programmer couldn't just run the level from the start. This wastes 5-10 seconds each time you load a level. And since in the later levels you die a lot, that's a TON of time wasted.  Bottom line: don't get it.

This game is more of a rage game than a happy, fun, shoot-em-up kid game. Even though you can tell this is definitely centered towards kids, this really isn't as fun as you'd think it is. You can tell it's towards kids because 1. Dubstep (that's it's ONLY soundtrack) 2. Simple, blocky textures 3. It's an FPS recreation of Minecraft.    Gameplay  It's exactly as you'd think- an FPS version of Minecraft. Nothing against the developers, but this type of gameplay is getting stale. I'm honestly surprised there weren't any COD weapons put in this game, considering how cliche it is.   Story  The story isn't really that original and is very forgetful. You start the game where your protagonist is sitting on his porch and is abducted by aliens and is forced to do these tasks to earn his freedom again. So basically, he just enslaved him. I say it's forgetful because damn, I really forgot I was captured by aliens while fighting off these Ice enemies shooting gigantic snow balls at me. True story, it's in level 5.    Gameplay Mechanics   The mechanics aren't exactly great in this game either. The developers chose not to go with checkpoints- which I think is a stupid idea. Without checkpoints, you are forced to restart the entire level if you die and quite frankly, dying is pretty common. Lots of the times, I'll get really far into the mission and then accidently fall off the edge of the platform I'm walking on and die, forcing me to restart the entire mission. This brings me to my next topic- enemies and how ♥♥♥♥ing overpowered they are.   Enemy Mechanics  No matter which enemy you are fighting, 1 hit will always take away 12 HP and you only have 100 HP. The enemy AI is programmed to kill you with no cost whatsoever, and so your enemies will hunt you down until they kill you or you kill them.  Killing enemies aren't hard at all , but when they stack up and you're against 3 or 4 enemies at once, they can kill you within  seconds .    Frame Rates  Finally, something good I can talk about. Frame rates are very smooth and do not drop below 50 FPS. This makes things a lot smoother and more easy to play.    Conclusion  Overall, I didn't have much fun with this game. It'd be a LOT better if they fixed jumping lengths (because on level 5, I died so many times just trying to get from spawn up to the giant ice enemy), added in multiplayer (both online and local), fixed enemy damage values, and maybe changed their gameplay a bit. I hate to bash on these developers because their game isn't really that bad, they just need some fine tuning before I'd call it a full retail game. 5/10",

I've always liked physics based games and just stuff that can be blown up with weapons. I really loved the look of the game and watched the trailer saying to myself: 'Wow! This has to be one of the coolest games released lately and it's only 4.99€!'. Although I payed 0.99€ for this.  Unfortunately, the 1€ was too high price for this... demo game. Everything is wrong about this game... AI sucks, levels suck, the game is too short and the game just feels like a huge scam! There are plenty of free Flash games that are better than this game. Flash games! Those games are considered softcore/only for casual gamers but here I am, a hardcore gamer saying Flash games are better than this piece of 'game'.  There's sop much potential about this game. This could've been a great game. Imagine. Multiplayer, co-op, level editor, Steam Workshop... It would've been great and would be awesome game to create levels in to. But at this point this game feels like an Early Access game that gets new stuff added every so often. But no. It seems like this is the final product. This is the game they are selling on Steam. This is the game that Valve accepted! This is what we are asking to pay for!  Do not buy this. Avoid at all costs. If you ever get to grab this for, I dunno, less than the price of 4 Steam Trading Cards then this game is definetly worth of grabbing because of the Tradnig Cards...

Creator of the game just set a couple of generic tags like; fps, zombies, dubstep and then just clicked the 'generate' button and his computer made this. Everything feels like procedurally generated, not just levels but artstyle, music, enemies, weapons too. Also fonts and menus are so ugly and tasteless.  Oh also don't get me started with the level 4, that 'nice try, you need to jump' part. Oh dear. You can't just show the enemies heads there and then say that 'you cannot shoot them'. This is not funny or humorous, this is just plain bad design. There is no bulletproof window or anything solid there that makes sense you to not to shoot because it won't hit. If you don't want to allow the player to just stand up there and shoot the baddies 'till they die, you have to design your levels better. Use the enviroment much better. Make use of the resource management, give the player less bullets. Make the ai much smarter. Then maybe we can talk about a good game design.  It has nothing that makes a game good and enjoyable. Don't waste your time playing that. If you so desperate to shoot zombies while listening dubstep, just open a dubstep playlist in the background and play left 4 dead or something that actually a good zombie shooter.",

The sixth level is hell, both in design and in how you play it. You start by running down another corridor only to turn a coner to go down another. At this point you see a big path that has a lot of lava which will kill you in one hit, you run down that while dodging big rocks; keep in mind that when you die you have to restart the level.

However, it's clear that the implementation falls short of the idea. I would have been totally fine with a short, simple and not particularly inventive game, as long as it played reasonably smoothly.  Dead Bits does not play smoothly, and most of the 'challenges' felt rather unreasonable. Everything you encounter smacks of unpolished, slapped-together amateur work. I'm not talking about the low-res models or the art style; I'm talking about things like the giant cube hitboxes which don't fit the models at all, or the obnoxious visual effects which obscure the path ahead.  The game is supposed to be a platformer at heart, but the level design is frustrating and seemingly pointless. Everyting is designed to rush the player into moving ahead without looking; but the frequent holes in platforms and enemy-clogged chokepoints make it impossible to just race through in time to the music. Instead, you're forced to take every section slowly and methodically, memorising the safe path and the enemy locations.  There is nothing which saves this game, nothing which creates a hidden bit of fun to explore. It could have been an enjoyable game if only the creator had spent more effort on making sure that the levels were layed out better, that the enemies were in interesting locations and not just clogging the narrow parts of the track, and that the weapons available actually fit the challenges ahead. The effects and music show that the creator did put time into this game, and I don't want to simply disparge someone's work. However, as a game it simply doesn't deliver -- the gameplay is constantly interrupted by failings in the design and execution of the game idea.   I can't reccomend this game to play.",

I got a headache when i played it and it was mostly the same.The first level started ok but then i became very boring and anoying.I spent about 99 cents on it,worst decision in my life. And i don't get the price: The game cost 0,99 € But the package that has the game and the soundtrack (which is awful) cost 1,99 € , so that means that the soundtrack costs more than the game. But if you buy the game and 'DLC' (soundtrack) buy separately then it costs the same,which is also dumb because the DLC and the game can't cost the same,its just dumb  The final score for this game by me is 1/10 Go buy yourself Coca Cola instead of this game!",

It's feels really samey despite trying to do things differently each level and some levels feel that they just drag on. There's around nine of them but the length and difficulty really start to rise around the 3rd. I wish checkpoints were a thing. The shooting is fun at parts but it's mostly either really simplistic or frustrating.  The dubstep-filled soundtrack is really awesome, glad that you can buy it alone, and the game does feel awesome at times but it feels like it could be more.  You may like it, you may think it's a waste of time. You can get it for pretty cheap now so you can figure that out for yourself. It was once $5 which is definitely way too much for this game but, even with the overall price drop, I can think of many other $1 games I'd recommend over this. I see potential here and I congradulate the dev for it and I hopw he can use it to make something really good.",

Nope. They're the final product.  - The dubstep is straight obnoxious. Listen, I enjoy dubstep. The dubstep here is -bad dubstep-.  - Jumping actually takes you in the direction you are looking, not in the direction your character is facing. If, on the first level, you look down at the place you're trying to jump, you might miss the first jump in the game because the game thinks you're trying to jump straight down as opposed to forward.  - Can't even get a consistent 30 FPS on my PC monstrosity if there's too many entities on screen... and it only takes a few!   - Guns make no sense (Shotgun that looks like it's powered by three colors of paint for some reason, automatic rifle that snipes with 100% accuracy and zero damage falloff, thereby removing the threat of enemies if you can see them from far away).  - AI is terrible and, in fact, may walk over empty space to get to you.  - There is no strategy. You see a zombie, you backpedal if it gets close.   I want to be civil, but this game well and truly has no redeeming factors. I have no idea how much I paid for it, but whatever it was, it was too much.   The only horror here is that Dead Bits exists. Solid argument against Steam Greenlight. I sincerely wish the devs better results in future endeavors.",
