    "description": "Once enter the game, you will see many UMAs in front of you. Your job is to use the bow or the crossbow to shoot the UMAs. The higher level, the more UMAs. Remember, you can only use the arrow of the same color to shoot the UMAs and you have to dodge the attack from the UMAs as well.",
