            "review_text": "I originally wrote a negative review for this game, then I played it again on a harder difficulty. I discovered that almost all of my complaints went away on a higher level, and I'm having tons of fun with it now.   I recommend going a level harder than you think you should, because if the game is too easy it eventually becomes a grindey snoozefest halfway through. On higher levels the enemy is constantly breathing down your neck and you're forced to prioritize your actions and plan ahead. Don't be afraid, the game doesn't become frustrating, it just gets more interesting.  By far the best aspects of the game are the graphics and the writing. The overall presentation is extremely charming and witty. The game has problems, but when you beat the game you get a message from the devs saying they have plans to fix the issues and spice up the gameplay. I've decided to trust them.  If the devs deliver what they promise, this could be a classic on par with FTL, but it's not quite there yet as of this writing.",

            "review_text": "This game is basically pokemon with spaceships. No, wait, it's like Pokemon FTL!  When you first start up the game, the tutorial shows you everything at once, and you may feel a little overwhelmed. However, after a few hours, it all starts to make sense. You are running a starbase, and in some ways the tech and structure building is like Civ, or even XCOM, though much simpler. Research is done the moment you can afford to click it. The further into the game you get, the more things open up. Your only military units are your officers, kind of like a team of pokemon, or your main cast of an RPG. You'll want to spread out your cast, and have as much variety in abilities as possible. While some may not like how slow it starts you off, it's for the best. The first few hours will have you fighting simple battles and leveling up your first few officers. What you'll soon learn is that battles are decided by how you use your special abilities. Most abilities do both damage and give your enemy a debuff. For example, your cannot may doo 100 damage, but also disable the ship's engines. This will make your enemy slower, sure. You can cast ability after ability to make your enemy slower, weaker, poisoned, etc. There are dozens of buffs and debuffs, and it's impossible to remember them all, so don't even bother. However, a better way to think of that attack you just pulled off is that you just turned your enemy into a water type pokemon. He may be slower, but he's also weak to electric attacks. And your fellow officer just happens to have a electric attack, baby. Now your second officer's ability, which is extra effective against enemies with the engines down debuff, suddenly does double damage, AND turns your enemy into a grass type Pokemon. What you want to do is figure out ways for your teams to synergise, because if you can manage to have teams that take advantage of each others' attacks, your team becomes very powerful. By the time you've figured all of this out, the story will have ramped up, enemies will become tougher, and you'll have enough officers for 2 fleets. And then you'll realize one of two things: 1) This game is freaking awsome! 2) This game is shallow as hell! Honestly, I fall somewhere in the middle, a little closer to the freaking awesome end of the spectrum. The art style is great, and everything is intuitive enough, but resource gathering can be a little tedius. There aren't many bugs left at this point, but the music can start to get a little repetetive. All in all, it's Pokemon is space. Seriously, if you like RPGs or Strategy games, and you like games like FTL or XCOM, then this game might be right up your alley. I recommend it.",

The $20 of game was fully delivered on the release date, and it's just getting better and better with each patch. I hope this game gets the accolades that it deserves.  One thing I am critical of in this game is that there are some issues with some of the diplomacy options in the main campaign. Fortunately, it looks like that's the focus of the next patch.  Seriously guys, this game is great. IMO, $20 is well-worth it just to support these developers and their adherence to excellence. I had nearly 100 hours logged before the second act was even added to the game. On release, it was a whole new game experience, and they are still overhauling/improving whole sections of the game.",

            "review_text": "It's not quite terrible, but Halcyon 6 leaves much to be desired. It's got influences from various games, but still manages to stand out from other ones, unfortunately in a bad way.   Let's get the premise out of the way. The federation is crippled, and you're the last commanding officer in charge of the  Citadel  Halycon 6. It's archeotech with the ability to make ships out of basically nothing but energy. You have to build up a roster of officers, and take back the galaxy from all aliens who would oppose you. The station and map is a bit like x-com. You have to clear out limited space on your station to build more rooms on it, generators, research buildings, etc. On the space map you can see incoming attacks and various resource outposts which you need to protect.    This is where problem #1 starts. Resource collection You have to lead to manually order a fleet around to pick up resources on each outpost. There's no way to set up a patrol routes leading you to constantly reroute fleet(s) around the map. Admittedly this ends in the second half of the game, but that was already at least 6 hours. I can't fathom why this was in the game. The only thing I can think of was to make you have to chose decisions on how to use your available resources, but it's really nothing to send out 1 or 2 ships and have them pick up supplies, it was the tedium of moving them around that stopped me, not because of lack of resources. Which leads me into problem #2   Problem #2: Resource Management I feel like this was another part of the game that instead of being a challenge, just ended up detracting from it. There are three resources and not once have I ever thought to myself 'man should I buy this upgrade or that one? Save up for a ship or get a bunch of upgrades?' It's never like this. Progression is so linear and the best options are so obvious that there is never a moment where I had to step back and think on my ultimate strategy. You'll always want to prioritize ships first, officers next, ship battle upgrades third. Everything else is either minor or so cheap it makes no sense not to get it. You'll never get an FTL flashback playing this game, wondering if you should use your scrap for an upgrade or save it and possibly die in order to get a great crewmember, or a dank weapon at a later shop. At some points at the game you'll just be twiddling your thumbs as you slowly produce more materials to get up a tier.  Problem #3: Combat Ugh. Where do I begin? The combat sucks. The easiest way to show that is the repition and lack of counterplay. Aside from maybe the few hardest boss ships in the game, every battle will play out the same way. You'll cast the same buffs, use the same debuffs, and use the same damage skills. If you're unlucky and get hit a lot you'll heal. This isn't exaggeration that no matter what the enemy fleet compisition is you'll use the same skills. Supposedly each ship has it's own weaknesses and resistances, but they're so minor that they're often not worth exploiting. Part of this because of the three ship classes. There's Tactical ships, Engineer, and science ships. Tacitcal ships are the only ships that can actually do any sort of damage in a reasonable time frame. Science ships tend to have the best buffs and heals, while engineer ships are just kind of there. Some of them can do a little more damage than science ships, and tend to have more damage reducton skills, but ultimately they're the worst class. Because healing skills are limited per battle the only real way fleet compisitions are either 1 / 1 / 1 , 2 / 1 / 0 , 2 / 0 / 1. Unless your tactical ship(s) can exploit the weakness (with a strong attack) or avoid the resistance just ignore them. Another thing are status effects. A lot of attacks can apply them, and many more can 'exploit them' meaning that the status effect is wiped out and your attack damage increased. This system is broken. Unless your tactical ship can exploit one of the status effects, or MAYBE a level 3 high damage skill, it's pointless to wipe out a beneifical debuff on an enemy for a paltry damage increase on your science or engineer ship. At higher tiers enemy damage starts increasing at a much higher rate than your hull points, leading your ships to flunctate wildly on hp, leading to x-com rng syndrome.    The music is alright, doesn't hold a candle to FTL's beats, and while the graphics are solid enough, the battle sound effects and visual effects are so overdone and lazily added you'll just want to skip them all. I kept playing this game thinking that at maybe higher tiers strategy would have to be involved, but it's just not there.    I didn't even mention ground combat earlier but it's just awful, unlike space combat which combines your ship skills and officer skills, ground combat is entirely reliant on officer skills, leading to a new batch of problems, and hit rates on both sides are much much lower.",

The biggest weakness is the fleet management, The designers aimed at people building more or less permanent fleets, but especially in the beginning it makes a lot of sense to work with many 1 ship fleets and it is easy to lose track.  The scripted events luckily get rarer later in the game. In the beginning I have too much to do, while I really economically want to do is assemble satellites everywhere.  I am in the middle of the game and never invested a single skill piont in ground combat skills. Appear very easy.  So far lost only one pilot in a space fight where I had no retreat button for no aparent reason.  All in all I enjoy the game a lot and it is definitely worth the money despite its few flaws.",

            "review_text": "Very addicting and lots of fun, but not without its flaws. Halcyon 6: Starbase Commander brings a lot of potential to the table, and really delivers with a lot of it.   The turn-based combat is very reminiscent of Darkest Dungeon, where your fleet will have to work together to debuff and exploit weakness in your opponent in order to prevail, rather than just spamming one or two moves. Every battle can be a legitimate threat, with no typical RPG random encounters of weak enemies only designed for grinding.  The base management is comparable to X-COM/XCOM, where you need to excavate and explore your base in order to expand. The problem I found with this is that you really have to compete to get time to expand your base, as any time spent by an officer exploring the base is time lost defending the sector or gathering resources. Once you get more officers this problem resolves, somewhat, but it definitely makes it harder to have enough room to build everything you need.  As for defending and gathering resources, the game does a very good job of overwhelming you, yet still keeping it reasonable. You need to keep your fleet patrolling the sector whenever possible to oust any incursions of pirates, Chruul (the main enemy race), or any other potential invading race. Your colonies will be raided frequently, and if you don't defend them efficiently, you're going to lose a lot of resource income. The game handles this very well, but there have been times that I've felt completely swamped by how much is going on, especially later on in the game.  I felt the game shined the most in the second part of the game, as after a point in the initial invasion the game will expand to you not only having to manage your own large sector of space, but also having to help the various other races that will either reward you for helping them or lash out in anger for leaving them. This is the point where I started to feel too overwhelmed, and started losing more colonies than I had lost in the first part almost immediately. I was playing on the second of five difficulties for my first run, so I would have appreciated if the difficulty didn't ramp up so immensely.  Overall, the game is fantastic, and I'm looking forward to finishing my first run along with playing again, though I don't know how replayable the game is going to be. It definitely has some issues in terms of difficulty, but those familiar with the type of challenge games like X-COM will throw at you should feel right at home with Halcyon 6: Starbase Commander.  UPDATE: Just finished the game, so I have a little more to say.  Towards the end of the game the difficulty ramps up quite a bit as the Chruul incursions in the other races' space got more and more overwhelming. However, I just started ignoring them and found no penalty in doing so. You don't really get any bonus or penalty for allying with or making an enemy of any of the races, so you can mostly just ignore them. You get small rewards for directly responding to incursions, but that's about it, there's no real diplomacy involved. There was some diplomacy going on near the beginning of the game as the other races will sometimes contact you, but it seems those contacts are only meant to address some new plot development and don't actually bear any change on how they think of you. In the end credits the developers mention that there will still be more content to be added to the base game, so what I would like to see is more depth to the other races. An example would be receiving random gifts or help from allied races, or occasionally finding yourself under attack from enemy races.",

            "review_text": "This has the same 3 on 3 battle system that started with Final Fantasy, with a very small twist: combos can be set up by using attacks that create vulnerabilities in the enemy. So the combos are only available if you arrange the attacks correctly.  Still, I was a little turned off by the 3 on 3 fighting before I bought the game. But it plays out really well and speeds up the game.  The XCOM comparisons are mostly (though not completely) 'dig out the basement to build office space' part of the game. Research allows certain rooms to be built out. This adds nicely to the gameplay especially weighing out how to spend resources. Research is paid for with the same resources used to make ships and upgrades, so its a big balancing act, with some dead ends on first play-throughs.  Officers can have one of 3 careeers: engineers, scientists or tacticians, and they each have a skill tree. They have a choice of 2 or 3 different ships for each career type, and each ship can have allocated attack build-outs. How a ship is built out, and how an officer is built out for ground or space attacks determines which attacks or specials can be used in a fight. Higher tiers of ships are eventually available.  I just bought the game, and proceeded to play a solid 3 hours nonstop, with no desire to stop other than I'm tired. But the game has the right stuff -- and there is some good light humor in flavor events. 'Take that stool sample to the lab and spare no expense!'  The game does feel a little grindy - which I've read other reviews saying to up the difficulty to get around that. There is a good feeling of accomplishment beating higher level enemies.  Lag? I haven't encountered any and my laptop is not very high end. This seems to have very low demands on a system, nor can I see any way the game would increase that demand the way the gameplay is set up.  I wholeheartedly recommend this for anyone who likes 4X space games. Even though this plays like a 4x - technically it is not. There are heavy storyline components and timed or triggered events, and the map seems to be static. But the same logistics and decision-making apply. Compared to a pure 4x - this is more interesting, because the pressure to resolve conflicts begins immediately, rather than many turns in.",

But instead of excavating spots, you commit an officer to clear it out. Maybe nothing happens. Maybe he runs into hostiles. I like it. I also like that once you build facilities you can order your officers to perform various tasks within. You need an officer to train new crew, or run a materials fabricator, or develop ship upgrades.  As you can probably tell by now, a lot revolves around your officers. They don't just command your ships. They explore parts of the alien starbase. They run most facilities. They establish new resource collectors, as well as build upgrades to them. And if they are doing one thing, they cannot be doing anything else. As a fan of RPGs, I love it. It is like I have my own little collection of heroes to manage. You can even rename them.. which I do. :)  Combat is more Final Fantasy style. Line up and hurl skills at one another. Pretty easy to understand. And it doesn't take much to realize how you can stack attacks for maximum effect. I like that there is ground combat as well as space. Though mechanically they are the same, just with different sets of skills used.  Resource gathering is a bit of a nuisance. You gotta fly out to the collector, load it, then return home. When you only have a couple of ships, that is a real pain. Means you cannot do the fun stuff, like combat or exploration. There is a way to automate, but I feel it comes way later in the game than it should.  Which gets me to another gripe: when things are secretly locked behind specific missions or events. I don't like it when seemingly-open games do this. I'm fine with locking tasks behind an officer-level wall. But don't hide parts of the game behind specific missions. If you do, at least mark these tasks as more important than the rest. 'Primary Task' or 'Campaign Mission' or something.  Really, these gripes don't take away too much from the game. Once you get near a half-dozen officers, things really take off. More officers, more fun things to do.",

And then sometimes you have ground combat which has an old school RPG feel to it like Final Fantasy. The space combat is like that too.  I'm a little biased, I love turn-based combat but there is something really unique to how they did turn-based combat. Different types of attacks have a chance to cause an affliction to the enemy ship/monster. If another member of your fleet/party has a skill that exploits that weakness, it does increased damage. That makes it so if you are good at micro-managing your parties/fleets and chain their attacks together you will be more effective. Very rewarding!  There is also this resource management component where at the beginning you have actually use your ships to transport resources to and from your base and then later on you can launch satellites to auto-transfer resources at a certain rate. There is a very deep tech tree.  All I can say is: WELL DONE!",

Cons - While the music is reminiscent of FTL, it's nowhere near as well composed, while I appreciate the attempt as having a unique soundtrack that tries to stand out using 8-bit and lots of strings, instead it just sounds somewhat droll and repetitive, composition can be challenging and I respect the artists' work, but these all sound like rough drafts, not finished products.  -The death animations for the organic 'ships' are still metallic and explosive, not sure if this is intended but I was hoping for space goresplosions.  -The resolution feels 'odd' even if its the correct dimensions, but this is most likely a technical issue on my side.  In summary, Go kill and/or ♥♥♥♥ every alien, robot, or trans-dimensional being you find 'Star Trek' style. 7.8/10 pretty fun.  (PS.

Pros:  - Excelent battle system for starships. I love how we can explore the status. - Beatiful pixel art. - Very light, works well in my ancient precursor's machine.  Cons  - limited and boring ground combat. - very few missions on the ground. - lacks of variation during in the game play. It turns to resources and level grinding very soon. - very few and repetitive events (i have two Bucky Rogers, a Cadet Academy event) - The main (and only) storyline is very cliché. Nothing happens outside a silly script that could have benn writen by a teenager. - The alien races looks very cool, but that's all. They lacks charisma. - The game offers 5 tiers of starships, 2 of each kind (tatical, engineering and science). 30 ships. It looks a lot, but inside the same category they are very similar, the just get stronger versions (that looks tougher). - The ships upgrades doesn't add anything but stats.",

The crew traits didn't seem to really matter to me, but not only that but the way it's worded makes it seem like roles are optional to each character... (which they are not). I'd say the most XCOM thing about it is the base building. The combat is more of a generic turn-based system with no movement involved... with an added 'inflict' &amp; 'exploit' buffs mechanic on top of it. The FTL comparison might be the oddest... I don't see it in this game at all unless you count the buff 'engines down' &amp; the need for fuel to fly (which I wouldn't consider FTL unique features at all).  Overall if you're looking for a random-gen generic turn-based story/random side stories type game with sn XCOM like base building feature (an a slightly annoying map ui). Then this is for you... I really feel as if they should drop the 4X &amp; FTL comparisons entirely... very different.  Also, the art is killer in this game &amp; you can't say there isn't passion on the screen when played... it's quite well rounded. Just marketed wrong in my opinion.",

I gladly spend money in Steam (100+ games, DLC, hats, etc.) and this is the first time I am asking for a refund. The game needed to stay in alpha/beta longer -- there are just such major problems with its interface and it's basic gameplay loop.  1. There are many interface problems.   1a. You can't zoom out far enough on the starmap and it's a major pain and waste of time to scroll around to find your fleets and look at the status of the points of interest. If you have played other space games like Stellaris, Sins of a Solar Empire, etc. -- you will understand how much of a pain you are in for if you can imagine in those games you did not have a fleet management overlay to use, and you could not zoom out at all on the starmap. Similarly for managing your base, the zoom is constrained and the text labels for the rooms are tiny. One is forced to click-drag and hunt for your rooms, and the rooms that have special statuses, you don't see the status until you click on the room.  1b. Also, the 'deep tactical combat' relies on you chaining and comboing moves together between your ships and officers. However, at the point where you need to choose a new officer, YOU ARE INEXPLICABLY NOT ABLE TO SEE YOUR EXISTING OFFICERS AND SHIPS TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION -- WTF? Thus I am forced to record on paper what skills my officers and ships have. Similarly during combat, the skills are not display unless you hover or right-click -- so you have to keep clicking on them to see, and you can't really memorize them because your officers skills are randomized (basically) from game to game.  1c. Various other annoyances, mostly things that waste your time, makes it difficult for you to plan your 'deep tactics', for makes it tedious to see the information that you need to make decisions. There is no overview where you can see all your ships and their stats/skills at once -- you have to click one-by-one and memorize them to keep track. Ditto for your officers -- you can only look at one officer at a time and there is no way for you to see them all at once to plan your skill builds, combos, etc. The 'deep tactical combat' depends on this planning, but the interface sucks for allowing you to do it.  2. To collect resources, it's essentially a cow-clicking game. I'm told that changes in mid-game, but I've just spent the last 16 hours learning the game, spending it in the early game cow-clicking. I have better things to do with my life than to grind through the cow-clicking in the early game. What is the point of cow-clicking resource collection? Especially if the game is already coded not to require it later in the game.",

Retro space strategy RPG. That it certainly is. The graphics are dire. If you like Commodore graphics, fine. Base building? I've yet to see any evidence but perhaps I haven't got far enough into the game. Deep tactical combat. What? So much of the game is spent running around killing Space Aliens that little time can be spent planning any deep tactical moves. Emergent StoryTellinging is supposed to reflect complex situations in gameplay that emerge from the interaction of game mechanics. Every time I've played this game I've seen the same old storyline so there's nothing emergent about it. Battle gets a little tedious. It is turn based zap em fare and takes little thought. You build big enough ships, that have the ability to heal themselves or each other, and you can bully your way around the star system beating up aliens and collecting HP and resources. A huge complaint I have is that Halcyon 6 itself, which builds these ships, has no way of healing itself. Indeed, until it blows up in your face, you have no idea of the health of the most important part of your game. I doubt I'll ever be drawn back into this game.",

It combines a little bit of combat, a little bit of base building, a little bit of exploration, and a lot of wanting to slap the alien-of-the-week upside the head for being crazy.  It has character and captures the feel of the genre it's aiming for, and that to some extent weighs more heavily than its gameplay problems, since you can rebalance gameplay more easily than you can revamp the feel of the game.  Pros: * Pixel graphics master race * Aliens are hilariously insane in a manner that reflects the Star Trek style genre without being too direct a copy * Cadets die with appropriate frequency when sent below decks to find out what that sound was * Combat relies heavily on applying/consuming debuffs, which can make for some interesting tactical choices (do you consume a sensor disable debuff to do more damage, or leave it on to keep enemy accuracy low?)  Cons: * Illusion of choice in ship selection - there are other ships in tier 1 other than the ones you start with for example but their ability balance leaves them subpar in actual usage * Play is vulnerable to the 'doom loop', where losing trained personnel in combat can mean being unable to continue, since it's not possible to train and equip new personnel fast enough to keep up with higher tier enemies. It is even likely to be completely unable to continue, in that attempts to harvest resources to rebuild a fleet after several ship losses and/or research higher tier ships can be stymied by your resource harvesting fleets being destroyed by pirates. The inability to retreat from combat when outmatched compounds this issue. * Illusion of choice in deployments due to limited officers - in theory having 4 officers is good, since you can send 1 to explore levels or harvest resources, or even split up 2 groups of 2 - in practice this is a recipe for failure since you can be ambushed and there is no option for retreating if you stumble upon enemies that you might have been able to handle if you had a group of 3 officers. See 'doom loop'.  I am somewhat hesitant to recommend the game as it is now, but presumably the above balance issues will be addressed in future development before it escapes Early Access. If they aren't this review will have to change to a downvote.",
