            "review_text": "Note: i did not play 35 hours, probably around 15 or so.  Right from the start i have to say that the game looks beautiful with it's warm looking simple art style, and the great soothing and mysterious original sound track it has that fills the void of your adventure through the game on solving its puzzles.  Speaking of puzzles, they're mostly simple to moderately challenging to finish, and it's really fun with how you can solve them in your own way by creating triangular platforms that gets more functions the more you progress through the game, like having their own gravity so you can walk on walls and ceilings. The game's campaign is also pretty lengthy for what it is, where i thought it would have ten levels max, but it actually has sixteen levels which is great.  The story isn't something to brag about but it definitely is very charming and with somewhat adorable (two) characters, and the ending was a nice satisfying happy one.  The bad things about the game is that there's a lack of a hint/help or a guide system which the game does need in my opinion in late, specifically speaking from chapter thirteen to sixteen, having to spend on one of those levels more so than the time spent on all past levels, trying to solve the puzzles in them. Also there's a problem with motion sickness that one might have during some of the levels in the game which it did get my dizzy but could handle it, but others may not be able to.  I was surprised and happy with how the game plays out with how much content is in it, and how creative their mechanics in terms of solving puzzles is, and overall the general quality of the game being good, seeing as how the price of the game is 15$ on Steam, and I'm happy to recommend this game for what you get in the overall package.

            "review_text": "Whoa. Wow. I was really impressed with this game. And really immersed too, where did those 20 hours even go...  At its core, TRI is a first-person puzzle platformer with relatively small levels jam-packed with secrets to find, on top of the main collectibles. The difficulty curve is pretty smooth, but steep; the game expects you to think outside of the box and be very aware of what you can and can't do. There's a ton of clever level design and puzzle design, and a lot of variety too.   There are a few minor flaws; chapter 13 is kind of ehh bad. Dying to acid or lasers makes you reload a save, which seems a bit much. Granted you'll end up saving a ton once you get to levels where you can die just so that doesn't happen, and usually it's only a minor inconvenience, but I don't see why it had to be that way. Oh well. There's also a few too many 'hidden behind fake tile' secrets, but they still aren't that prevalent and most of them have some indication.   Other than that? A lot to love. I really can't explain why it's great without spoiling puzzle solutions or the quirks of the mechanics, but it's well worth your time to play. Definitely would recommend, but it's not for everyone, that's for sure.",

            "review_text": "PROS: *Great visuals *Impressive levels and design *Unique and interesting triangle mechanics *Good atmosphere *Music fits *Save and quicksave features *Some replayability if the player is interested in collectibles or competition  CONS: *Not much emphasis on actual puzzles; platforming and exploration are the stars here *Some frustrating elements, like directing balls of light with curving paths to particular destinations or placing the three points of a triangle at precisely the right positions *Minimal story *Little to no sense of connection between levels *Some collectibles locations are too hard to find without a guide  GAME LENGTH: Even with a guide to the collectible locations, achievement hunters can expect to take 20+ hours to complete the game without a walkthrough. Those interested only in completing the game can expect to finish in substantially less time, perhaps around 12 hours.  SCORE: 7 out of 10  My feelings about this game are in conflict, partly due to my expectation that it would have a heavier focus on actual puzzles and meaningful exploration.  I spent the first 10 or so of TRI's 16 levels wondering where the puzzles were. I figured that the platforming (enabled by the game's TRI mechanic, which allows the player to walk on walls and ceilings) would largely be an interesting means of navigating from puzzle A to puzzle B, which I would then solve to get the statuettes that are needed to proceed to the next stage. Instead, the platforming itself often seemed to be the puzzle. Reaching my goals was mostly about locating and climbing to them, not thinking about what actions I needed to take and in what order. Even reaching areas that appeared inaccessible from the start was just a matter of moving through the level and, say, falling down the right hole. The last third of the game began to incorporate some puzzles, but they were too little (too few, too simple), too late.  I could have accepted this problem as a feature rather than a failure. Perhaps the developers intended for the TRI mechanics to be the stars of the game instead of the puzzles. Unfortunately, I found myself fighting with some of the TRI mechanics as well, particularly the light reflection. There are 'puzzles' that involve reflecting a beam of light off the player's placed triangles to hit a crystal, which powers some part of the environment. For me, setting the three points of my triangles just so was very time-consuming and not fun at all, especially when the beam of light had to be reflected down hallways or holes in the ground to reach other rooms. Sometimes the reflected light was dangerous, so I had to duck under or platform around it to get a good enough vantage point to precisely draw my next triangle. Worse than the light beams, however, were the 'kami', balls of light that follow a set, curving path from some spawner and bounce off your triangles. The curve in their path is largely preserved after they bounce, so placing triangles to get the kami where I wanted them to go was even more difficult. Fortunately, the most frustrating of these scenarios are intended to be completed only if the player wants to collect the optional golden idols.  As a completionist and fan of exploration in video games, I naturally sought out every golden idol. Each level contains usually 9 to 14 of them, hidden in out-of-the-way nooks, in awkward ledges, in acid, behind bars that are lifted by pressing a button, and so on. It's safe to say that locating and collecting these constituted the majority of my play time and that there would not be much game in their absence. Sadly, they are the only incentive for exploration, since the environments themselves reveal little to nothing of the meager story or the world (universe?) in which the game takes place and generally feature nothing noteworthy except some opportunities for screenshots. The golden idols also do not reveal more of the story, but they are not totally without value: as the player collects them, he unlocks developer commentary and notes for each of the stages as well as achievements. Still, I would have preferred some more game-related incentive for pursuing them, especially considering the time that went into doing so. It doesn't help that there are no in-game clues, whether subtle arrows or 'proximity pings', to their locations, especially when they are hidden behind wall tiles that look like any other.  I have nothing bad to say about the other aspects of the game. The levels are large and well-designed. The art is lovely. The sound is just right and the unobtrusive music suits the game. The player can save at any time, including by quicksave; loading is quick; and any chapter can be replayed later. The options menu allows for decent customization of the experience. There is an optional 'challenge mode' for each stage that involves using as few triangles as possible. Unfortunately, the parts of the game that I care about most just didn't meet my high expectations.  If you're looking for a puzzler, rewarding exploration, or a deep story, this game is probably not for you. If you're looking for a low-stakes, casual, (mostly) relaxing platformer with pleasant visuals, well-designed levels, and an interesting gameplay mechanic, consider buying it. Just be aware that, given what it is, you may feel that the game overstays its welcome if you try to fully complete all 16 chapters.  Despite the tone of my review, I would still say that I found the overall experience enjoyable enough to recommend it, especially given what I paid for it at a heavy discount. Considering the size of the development team and the lack of games of this quality in this genre as well, I give it a 7 out of 10. I look forward to this team's future work, which I hope will focus more on substance than style.",

But you will get fast better at orientating while playing. The level design is very good and rivals the level design in Portal 2. At at least one point it has similarities with mechanics from Antichamber. I am sure the developers had a fun time to make the levels and they love to challange the player with (almost) impossible tasks. Really a recommondation for those who want their mind f**ked",

As one progresses through the game, the levels become bigger and more intricate, and the amount of work one has to do becomes exponentially bigger. It's not that the game is insanely hard, it's just insanely tedious. The main mechanic of the game is to create triangles to use as platforms, or to place them on walls to be able to walk up the walls. So that's what you spend most of your time doing. Creating triangles to be able to get from one place to another. This isn't something that requires thought, this is just busywork. I got up to level 7 or 8, and when I saw just how big the map was, I gave up with the game.  And not even bother with the collectibles. Ffs, they are a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to get to. I spent half an hour travelling the outside of a level to find one or two collectibles, and I might have had to restart the whole level because I triggered an event in the game by accident, preventing me from leaving a room afterwards. Either I restarted the level, or I spent ten more minutes building triangles until I reached the ceiling and escaped through there; I can't remember.  Other reviews mention later that you have to use triangles to reflect lasers, and that you get to teleport. Frankly, I'm afraid of just how tedious things would get after that.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game. I think it's a lovely game. It has foxes in it, and I love foxes, so I immediately love the game. The levels are pretty, the idea behind the game is fun, and the story is a nice enough motivation to play the game. Wanting to know what happened with the foxes was my only reason to play. But the game doesn't respect my time, and I have better uses for my time.",

            "review_text": "The game annoyingly asks to you leave a review every single time you load it up. It's almost as bad as eBayers who email you 30 seconds after the end of the auction begging for positive feedback. So here you go.  TRI is tedious. It has a really good premise, and it's quite pretty to look at, in a polygonal sort of way. The mechanic is an interesting one - the ability to create solid platforms on which you can stand to move yourself around the place. Unfortunately, that seems to be the only mechanic. Whereas in Portal the game introduces new ideas on a regular basis, this game seems to quickly run out of ideas and you spend 80% of your time doing the same thing - producing a series of overlapping triangles so you can move up a wall. Remember how towards the end of Portal 2 you had to climb up the shaft by repeatedly using the slingshot technique? Well, that's most of the game here. Many times I just got bored and closed the game because I was utterly fed up with doing exactly the same thing over and over and over and over again.  It's a shame. This game had a lot of potential, but it suffers from far too much padding. And it's glitchy. The 'wall running' code in particular seemed to hate me...I'd be walking along the wall from triangle to triangle, and suddenly the game would decide 'Nope. You're not doing that any more', switch the gravity back to normal, and I'd fall all the way down and have to start again. It's inconsistent - most 'deaths' in the game such as falling off the end of the map simply teleport you back to solid ground with no penalty. And then half way through the game, it starts introducing elements which CAN kill you, with no warning. Hope you remembered to save!  In addition, the game has a Linux port. Now, normally this is cause for celebration as too few developers make the effort, so it should be applauded. However, it's been done in the second-laziest way possible (The laziest being to stick a WINE wrapper around it and call it a day). There IS a Linux version, but there's no support. I suffered a problem which meant the game wouldn't start, and when I asked for help, the developers replied 'Yeah...sorry. We don't actually know anything about Linux so we can't help. You should ask for a refund.'. Given we have to pay the same for the game as Windows players, why should we have to provide our own tech support? I'm building up an increasingly large list of games in my inventory which have a Linux port, but they're broken and the developer either can't ('We no longer have access to the code') or won't (they just ignore us) fix it. (Randal's Monday, Bit Dungeon II, Edna &amp; Harvey - The Breakout, 6180 The Moon etc)) If you're lucky, they remove the Linux version from the store to stop other people making the same mistake, but that's no consolation to those of us who bought it first.  As it happens, the game started working again...but I know that if I have the same problem, I'm on my own. It's dishonest and misleading to proudly claim to support Linux, but then just shrug when there are any issues. If you can't support and assist people then it shouldn't have been released,  However, I don't think I'll be finishing it as the game is too boring. Sorry. I might come back to it in the future, but for now it's on the 'Can't be bothered to finish' pile.",

            "review_text": "Dizzying, motion sickening and tiresome retreading: these are the most poignant features Tri: Of Friendship And Madness has to offer. We mostly follow vague hints â€“ such as foxes that disintegrate the second they are approached â€“ and not so much clear cut goals or an interesting storyline. Unfortunately this is what really makes this game an abjectly abhorrent experience. A lot of dizzying puzzling, with very little reward.  The story, as the name suggests, consists of the relationship between two foxes, being torn asunder, and in the process having their friendship tested. A test that, it seems, the player has a major part in (although the player is not one of these friends, or is he?) â€“ signifying our insignificance outside of the grunt work, gameplay, that we are forced to do, for the sake of progression, of course.   The gameplay is an interesting novelty, puzzles that are to be solved with triangles in a myriad of different combinations and game-mechanics. There is a major issue with this free-form triangle-building (unless it's on wood), and that is that the correct solution is not readily available, it's really unclear what you are supposed to do, or the even more nebulous question if you're actually on the way towards a game-progressing idol, or an optional one. Because the different paths wind endlessly around the actual point of progression and side-rooms are a huge distraction and ultimately serve to muddle the main objective. A lot of the puzzle-solving devolved to a matter of stacking triangles to get high enough to jump to a place, which was the hight of frustration and tedium that I experienced, and, if intended, was just plain bad puzzle-design. Also, I managed to perform some jumps that did not seem to be intensional design, which proves both how frustrated I was to try maniacal jumping until I got where I wanted to be (and perhaps it proves how stupid I am) and how little sense there was to the level-design.   But to mention some positives, and perhaps touch on why I actually bought the game to begin with, before my thoughts was negatively infected by frustrating design-decisions. The game, when still novel, looks rather quaint. It has really nice colors, much like games such as Mirrormoon EP, a game I love the visual design of. Tri has that same wonderful visual style, but it wears out after you see the same texture for the nth time. The new experiences the game dolled out were fairly enjoyable, and I did enjoy the novelty of it, albeit it very temporary. The art in between the levels, the cutscenes, loadingscreens, set the tone and never felt discrepant, which is always nice to see a game get right.  The story seemed to be heartfelt, but can only really be judged on an individual basis, since I am far too cynical and bitter to enjoy the silly nature of a game like this. The writing and narration does bring the game down a bit â€“ if you were to score it â€“, perhaps my expectations were too high, but the narration was really not well voice-acted, and the writing was but a reflection of that poor performance. I want to say that the writing sounded like a young adult trying to replicate a Tolkien prelude, but that may be too harsh, only probably not.   Sonically, Tri also fit the tone, and it was honestly one of the best parts of the experience for me, although, the overt stop and start of the loop, and the silence in between, created a kind of weirdness to the audible atmosphere, almost like it didn't fit, due to the vicissitude of its initiation and termination. Perhaps the music would be better suited in isolation, that is, listening to it while not playing the game.   Tri is a decent game, I am mostly writing this for equally bitter people who might get suckered in by the artstyle. The game is not what it seems, and that disappointed me, but it may be enjoyable to you. I am not going to recommend it, because I didn't find enough redeeming qualities to salvage or outweigh all of my quandaries and frustrations with the game, but you should not take my word for it. Some of the puzzles are really interesting and it's probably worth playing just because of the novelty that a game solely based on triangles possesses.",
