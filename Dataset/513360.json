            "review_text": "This is a very Q&amp;D (quick and dirty) review of Mu Cartographer. (Because of the sale, true, but not because of the badge.) Unfortunately, I began this game too late for the detail that it so richly deserves (and the game contains, even though this review does not. Yet.) The sale will be ending very soon, and I wish to encourage friends, and others, to consider this game if they are interested in any one of the following:  Challenging and complex (but fun, and not ridiculously difficult) puzzles that explain themselves strictly in the context of these unique puzzles and environment. Your mind will (hopefully) adapt to the puzzles.  NO hands-on training. The player will, or won’t, understand almost every aspect personally, and love the feeling of each breakthrough. And understanding is progressive and logical.  Breathtakingly beautiful music and sounds.  Beautiful, yet to be explained alien landscapes to explore….from a distance, using controls that have little connection to the world we know. Color and texture is a huge part of Mu Cartographer.   If any of the above may be appealing, this price of $2.49USD for Mu Cartographer is, like the game itself, simply too good to pass up. My friends, Mu Cartographer is one of the really, really good ones (and I won’t even qualify for the badge, even with this review. But YOU will qualify for a really special game!)  (SPOILER HINT - If you get a bit stuck near the beginning, there's a pretty big clue in the Store Page trailer.)   Thank you.",
