E.g. you collect many small loot-fragments from defeated enemies but the tractor beam has to be bought via micro-transactions (and not simply bought but RENTED DAILY(!) ).  The game itself is a cheap 2D top-down arcade game and not really special in any way.",

            "review_text": "POSTED: OCTOBER 8 It's a top down MMO space shooter with a bit of depth to it. 150 level cap and lots of resource gathering for upgrades. Flux is this game's currency used to buy ships and other nice non-essential things. You can either buy flux with real money or you will have to grind missions/daily logins for it in-game.  Pros: *Plenty of different ships, some have unique weapons pre-installed on them *Plenty of weapons, over 100 of them and they are all quite fun to play around with *Artifacts are this game's form of loot to help improve your ship's stats in general, they are randomly generated too *PvP matches although it needs some improvements to keep things more balanced *Open world PvP where you could of course take on higher/lower level players *Boss battles that are quite tough, especially if you haven't got a good setup or a strategy for taking them on *Storyline quests, gives you something to work toward as it takes you through all the systems *Timed missions, these are randomly generated quests that give you some decent rewards *Daily login and missions give you some cool rewards for minimal effort  Cons: *Playerbase isn't very large and not sure whether it will increase by much *Lag spikes and desync seem to happen a bit of the time, especially when picking up lots of loot *Boring for players that constantly want something new and fresh every time they play it as it's very grindy *Crew feature which is used to upgrade your artifacts needs serious improvement (Takes too long to train them up) *Co-op survival while fun, needs to be improved so that exp loss on death isn't something that puts people off of it *Grindy, as mentioned before. If you want new ships, upgrades or levels, you will need to grind quite a bit for them *Devs, apparently they are not interested in changing or adding much to the game (From what people say) *Bugs, quite a lot of them and I'm not talking about the ones in-game that you shoot at *Upgrading, requires too much resources after you've made previous upgrades to things on your ship. Prevents you from investing and experimenting with other weapons which ruins the weapon variety  Overall, this game has a lot of potential to be something amazing. It has loads of variety in weapons, ships, artifacts and strategies to go with them but it gets boring fast if you don't like grinding out levels and missions. Personally, I enjoy it very much and can see myself being part of this game for a good while. I do hope that the devs put in some more effort to make this game the best it possibly can be as well as add in some more co-op related stuff but for now, the game is good for what it is.  I would recommend playing. 7/10, 9/10 for the F2P section",

            "review_text": "I really love this game truly do. Its very simple yet elegant. It is a grinder/lvler for sure, but it is fun and has some nice chanlenges ahead. I wish this game had more variety as far as galaxy and mobs/ships. In game upgrades or customizations are a bit expensive and require alot of grinding on either farming mobs/ships or missions. The reason I will not reccomend this game is because there are so few players servers are dropping. If you dont have a friend to play this with you it will get kind of old because most players dont talk and its hard to talk to someone while flying around (accuratly) and shooting lazers or beams whatever your weapon is.",

You basically go through doing missions and collecting stuff, the end goal is to be able to kill all the enemies, and if you like PVP be #1. some people think it pay to win but it is not, it is pay to get a boost, you can get the best stuff in the game legitimately, it just takes longer, my friend is one of the best players in the game and he hasn't spent any money, he has one of the best ships.",
