            "review_text": "  Disclaimer. I was one of the Streamers who was given a key to play/hype this.  However, this is the sort of game that reminds me of playing games in my youth. A top down 'rogue Like' mech shooter.  It has never crashed, it is cheaper than a pint of beer, it runs smooth, the music is reminiscent of old arcade games and makes you bop. I am a full fan boy of this game. Nobody has asked me to say that, i'm not being held accountable. In fact on various occasions i was asked if there was any bad feedback. I have yet to find something i dislike in it.  It has a difficulty level that will take you through 'the six stages of aegis'. From ragequitting, to hating and all the way through to acceptance of your fate.  Enjoy!",

            "review_text": "I must admit to never before having played any 'Roguelike' games. It was the fact that I kept reading about the genre of games and seeing how popular they are that I was keen to finally try one.  When I first installed the game I ran into some problems - the text was not appearing. It turned out that this was due to my desktop running in 4K. I got in touch with the developers via Twitter and they were very quick to reply. I lowered my desktop resolution, restarted the game and was able to access the Graphics Settings. I chose to run windowed and was then able to put my desktop back to 4K. Since this game is Early Access I am sure that problems like this will be fixed before it gets a full release.  When I started my first game it took me a little while to realise that I had to use W,A,S and D to move my mech. I was clicking with the mouse thinking it was more like Cannon Fodder to move around. The in-game help text is minimal and, at first, I found this to be a problem. However, it seems that I have fallen foul of a common, modern-day problem: I expect everything to be spoon-fed to me. When I was chatting with the developers - they said that a lot of feedback they have received praised the discovery element of the game. Once I engaged the part of my brain that was prepared to figure stuff out then things started to make sense. This leads to a sense of achievement that I have not experienced in gaming for a long time - probably since the 8-bit days.  At the moment I have only played the game for a few hours and I still have not managed to complete it. I am probably spending far too much time just getting more resources and taking them back to my base. I am still learning new things but my main tactic is to engage an enemy and then lure them back towards my base where my defences will destroy them.  I recommend this game - particularly if, like me, you are new to this genre. I can't compare it to other 'roguelikes' since this is the first one I've played. Feel free to recommend others I could play for comparison!  Oh, I also purcahsed the OST and love the 80's synthwave vibe to it!  Rich  ",
