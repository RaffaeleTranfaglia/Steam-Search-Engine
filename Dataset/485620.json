This game is great for people who want a low price game that you can enjoy. This is a turn based card strategy game. This is probably the first time I have ever enjoyed that genre. The goal of the game is to kill the other players hero card. You can spawn in minion cards to attact and defend your hero card. There are two rows that you can spawn cards in. The front row will defend and back row will attack. You can only attack the back row if your front row is empty. Each turn has you pick two cards to add to your deck. Those cards are put onto one of the two rows. I had alot of fun playing this with friends online. When playing with friends, you can play locally or online. when playing locally, you can use the same gamepad/mouse &amp; keyboard since it is turn based. The game is a port of an Xbox Live Indie, so it supports gamepads. You also have Steam Trading Card support so if you don't know if you will enjoy it, you can at least try it for a dollar andget some trading cards out of it. 8.5/10",
