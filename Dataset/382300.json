Nothing in the game really stands out.  If you're familiar with the horror genre, you've already seen it all: Vaguely creepy sound effects, strange monsters that try to chase you, crazy notes lying around, etc. It tries very hard to be scary, but a lot of it just comes off as cheap jumpscares. No unique mechanics, no interesting story, nothing.   Story is absolute nonsense.  From what I can tell, you're some random person who's been kidnapped (hence the name). You're never told why. It starts off in a dark mansion in chapter 1, then it's a cave in chapter 2, and then you're in the middle of the woods in chapter 3. None of it makes sense!   Full of bugs.  Hitboxes are awful, invisible walls are everywhere, and sometimes you'll die for no reason. I shouldn't be shooting an enemy at point-blank range and not even hitting it!   It's about what you would expect for $2.99. Certainly better than some of the other games on offer for the same price, but nothing remarkable.",

            "review_text": "  Quick review:  Positives: +atmosphere  Negatives: -everything else  ---  First of all, the game runs pretty horribly.  My PC isn't _that_ bad and sometimes the game would just lag horribly when I ran into objects for example. The atmosphere at least was pretty good and the couple of jump scares got me that I managed to see... Before the game crashed at the end of Chapter 1. Everything was feeling pretty tedious already and I wasn't really that immersed in the game, because it felt so clunky so that was enough for me. I didn't hear enough of the narration to have much of an opinion, but let's say I've heard a lot worse.  Maybe if the game ran better, your character could actually run (run key makes you go like 10% faster compared to your sloooooooooow normal speed) and the crashing issue was fixed this could've been something. But as it is, it's not even worth 3€ as I got bored after like 30mins of playing (until the game crashed), which felt like 1,5 hours.  Luckily I didn't pay a penny for this, as I got the key for free from a giveaway. ",

For starters, it seems to constantly lag (this could be just my computer, but my brother seems to have the same problem as well on his) but the animals in the forest get 'stuck' when they are either attacking or fleeing, and my character freezes and gets stuck a lot as well, and secondly *spoiler* when you have to find the key to the church, it won't allow me to push the fake gravestone the correct way to get the key from underneath it. If those things get fixed, It would be an A++ game.",
