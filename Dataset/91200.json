            "review_text": "Blending fast-paced, explosive action with а tactical battlefield command, Anomaly puts players in charge of a military convoy tasked with fighting back against the mysterious alien war machines that have begun to spring up in many of the world's largest cities. Players take part in battles personally to support and assist a hand-picked armor squad, utilizing their top-down tactical view to plot each and every turn of the convoy. As they progress through the story campaign and challenge modes, players will unlock upgrades and new units to build their ultimate destruction squad. I had no idea this would actually be all that entertaining. I'm a big fan of tower defense games, and this is a pretty good example of it flipped over. The graphics are very nice, the only other TD game. The game is beautifully voiced. Has a typical, yet working storyline. The mechanics are very dynamic, fast-paced, yet easy to learn. The game is just pure fun, it is unique in its approach to tower defense, and intermixing strategy allowing you to determine the step you think is best suited for the situation at hand, great action. Really worth the time!",

            "review_text": "  “Strategy requires thought, tactics require observation.”    Anomaly: Warzone Earth (A:WE) is a hybrid reversed tower defense simulation crossed with a real-time strategy game developed by the company 11 bit studios with emphasis on combat and tactics.    Atmosphere &amp; presentation:    + Creative gameplay concept, where the player leads his attacking units through static towers. + Impressive balance between strategy and action keeps up the motivation.  + Well-done art direction and particle effects.  o Solid background music. o Alien design is rather playful.    Combat &amp; gameplay:    + Player escorts his convoy with an on-foot commander, who can collect and deploy tactical power-ups. + Coordination of the units, scouting out positions and deploying resources create a dynamic gameplay. + Strategic elements in form of route planning, convoy make-up and order of units. + Units can be upgraded up to three times increasing their effectiveness. + Additional spawning of enemy towers keeps the player on edge. + Challenging end boss fight.   o Column of vehicles is limited to six units. o Game speed can be adjusted.   - Only six different models of enemy towers.    Characters &amp; story:    + Original background story.  o Solid voice work.  - Limited identification of the player with the protagonist.    Summary:    11 bit studios succeeds in reinterpreting the traditional concept of tower defense games. A:WE offers a lot of fun in trying to make the most efficient routes, that could cause greatest amount of devastation while minimizing both exposure and travel time.

Storyline could be a bit more engaging, but even if you skip the scenes you still get an idea on what's going on. There's a good variety of vehicles and each one has its own purpose and speciality.  Unlike others are saying, the game is not boring. If you feel like you want to speed it up a bit you can just press  shift  and let it flow.   10/10    It's a fresh and great looking game on the scene. ",

If you've seen one of them you've seen pretty much all of them. Not this one though. This one is different. It's a reverse-tower defense title, meaning you have to run with an actual character and guide your tanks across a city. Along the way alien towers spawn on the sides of the road and it's up to you to change your formation, help them out yourself with dropping small nukes and smoke bombs and create a safe path using a virtual map of the city. It's actually quite refreshing and I suggest to anyone who loves TD games (like I do) to buy and try.  [Rating: 85/100]",

Anyway, I love the way the game switched sides of the classic tower defense games.  The only thing I didn't liked (but that isn't much of a deal) is the fact that I found a squad formation that managed to beat all levels on the hardest difficulty. What I mean is that the game doesn't make you find new ways to play. You may play always the same way and still get trough. This doesn't mean the game gets boring, although.  8/10",

The player controls a commander who is on foot and escorts a squad of up to six vehicles and helps defend them while taking out the enemy. The vehicles are the primary offense against the horde of alien turrets blocking their path. The commander can utilize four different abilities which include a decoy, smokescreen, healing, and an air strike, however you must collect tokens to enable those abilities and are typically given a small stash before each mission begins. The abilities are stackable so you can place as many as you want provided you have enough tokens. He can also purchase additional vehicles using money collected by destroying turrets or shooting crystals. Vehicle position and route planning are vital and can be managed while the action is paused. Each vehicle also has three upgrade points that cost money which give it more offensive punch plus additional armor.  It is a short game of about 4-5 hours. It offers two primary campaigns and a final boss battle. There are also a couple extra missions beyond the story mode. It is a solid game that doesn't offer a whole lot of depth, but it's simplicity is one of it's major strengths. It's a nice spin on the traditional tower defense genre that could open the door for better games of this type in the future.",

It's well-composed enough to even be easily ignored so you can concentrate on keeping that shield generator up. The unit variance is perfectly balanced so that you don't have too many, and the resource acquisition is paced well enough so you never feel like your being short-changed (on casual). There are three modes; casual, advanced and hardcore. I'm not sure what they do to scale the difficulty, but it could be anything from tapering the resupplies to raising the damage done by enemy towers.
