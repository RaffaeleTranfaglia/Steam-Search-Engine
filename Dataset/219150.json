            "review_text": "Okay, out of pure boredom, I decided to write a full review about every specific thing in the game.  If you just came here to know everything about the game before you buy it, I would highly recommend you to buy it, but I think I should head over to the cons before anything.  If you can relate to these things being bad, or unenjoyable, then you may need to reconsider buying this game. - 8-bit (or 16-bit, whatever, OR 24-BIT, WHATEVER) graphics. If you dislike those kind of graphics, remember that the whole game is pixelated. - Very difficult. If you’re a person who is overall bad at games, or like specific game styles, remember that everything in the game is very, very, VERY difficult, unforgiving, and did I mentioned that it’s difficult? You will die all the time and I mean it. - Very fast-pasted. If you’re a casual gamer who enjoys gameplay that involves no stress at all, you should definitely reconsider buying this game. - No multiplayer.  If none of the things I just mentioned don’t bother you, I would REALLY recommend you to play this game. Okay, now when that is out of the way, let’s talk about specific aspects. 1. Gameplay It has a top-down perspective. (Look at the screenshots if you don’t understand.) Where you kill people with melees and guns. You can throw them, too, which is unique compared to most games that feature guns. Throwing the guns at a person resorts in knocking them down, and you execute them by pressing the space bar. If you have no melee equipped, you will need to left-click a few times before you kill the enemy. But if you wait a short while, the enemy will get up, equip the nearest weapon he can see, and will try to attack you again. There are enemies that require weapons, such as dogs, fat guys, and dodgers.  Also, a very significant thing about the gameplay is that you get to choose a mask with different abilities. Want dogs not to attack you? Choose Ted. Want to make the enemies not hear the gunshots, and just kill them one-by-one? Choose Peter. Want to kill enemies just by throwing the guns? Choose Jake. You get the point. 2. Visuals  They’re 24-bit, but they’re very detailed for a pixelated game (especially the faces that appear whilst dialogue). And if you’re a fan of gore in videogames, then you will definitely enjoy this game, considering that this is one of the goriest games that I’ve ever played. Okay, I’m not too much of a gamer, but my point is that the game is gory, especially in the second game. 3. Story Sorry, I can’t summarise the story chronologically in a few sentences, but it’s interesting, dark, mysterious, and confusing. Google search it if you want to. It won’t spoil anything, it’s hard to put the puzzle pieces together when playing the game. The first game has barely any story comparing to the sequel, and it constantly takes different roles and time periods.  4. Music If you would ask anyone who has played Hotline Miami what stands out about this game, one of the first answers would be the music. It really gives you the atmosphere that the game takes place. In my opinion, Hotline Miami 2’s soundtrack is much better, but a lot of the songs used in the first game are very iconic and popular.  Thank you if you actually read this.",

            "review_text": "Now I can tell you one thing... This is a must have for shooter fans. Hotline miami bought me nothing but fun solid gameplay. With a clever story and intense gameplay you will drool as you see all your victims lie on the ground dead. Objective? KILL EVERYONE  Story: Game as a very clever plot if you dig in. I will tell you a bit of the story, you play as an unnamed protagonist (dubbed 'Jacket') who starts getting unknown phone calls that are basically telling him to go to locations and kill Russian mobsters/mafia. As you continue to kill you start losing insanity trying to make out what is real or not. This is as much info as I will tell you. But the backstory and secrets will shock you to the core.  Gameplay: This is a fast paced game. If you can't react fast or think fast then this isn't a game for you. In this game you wear masks to aid you when killing people, they can either boost your speed, assist you with guns or even gain you more points. The executions are brutal where you smash heads and stab people, this game is not for the faint hearted! The enemies react and attempt to kill you on sight but they aren't smart. Melee enemies are easy to take out since your fists are enough to get the dropped weapon and enemies with gun are a challenge but I think you can manage that. Overall fast and fun gameplay  Art: The art is nice and decent. The art is simple and not to pretty. The sprites for main characters are nicely made and simple, the russian mobsters sprites have one same look (they are all bald). The level design are simple design but there are some good designs and colours. But the face portrait for when the characters are talking are well done! And lets not forget about the blood. This game has a habit of being really messy and bloody and I really like that. YOU CAN SEE HUMAN BRAINS THEY ARE SO REAL 76/10! But the design alright its not good looking but I like it that way!  Music: Has to be one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a video game. The music fits in well with each level I play and I can really feel the rush. Some are intense, some a good to dance to and some a great for relaxing after slaughting your enemies. There isn't any rock or pop its club or DJ music. I really enjoyed listening to the music and you will too.  Negative: One thing that I will say this... what you are doing is so evil and bad that its not funny. And I am saying that for people who are thinking of getting this game cause I love bloody games with blood and gore.   Conclusion: This wasn't a long review but decent review. For two developers this is really impressive. But if you are really thinking of getting this game then you should buy this without thinking. This game deserves $10! MIAMI FOREVER   Note: Sadly for you aussie gamers... hotline miami will not be coming to Australia due to ONE ♥♥♥♥ SCENE! You could skip that scene, it was pretty much the only one and it was poorly made. The developers said you should just pirate the game which is a shame cause I really want to be it with my own money.  ",

You'll have to plan your moves on the stage, try, fail, try again, fail again, replan your moves and eventually beat it.  Its storyline isn't very dense but that doesn't mean it's flat. In fact, I thank it wasn't a long story that would have converted this game into an eBook (I hate when games make me read for ages). After you beat the main story you can still play other character's story.  You might think this is a casual game and that you couldn't really get involved with the character or the storyline, but as you play you'll realise your heartbeat is rising and you're getting more and more nervous. Congratulations, you're Hotline Miami addicted and you won't leave it until you finish it.",

            "review_text": "Hotline Miami is a game about someone going around and murdering people. Sort of.  It is a top-down run and gun styled game, where one hit will kill you. So you don't really want to play it like a run and gun game, or you'll die much more, the game awards you for being reckless and making up plans as you go.  The story can be rather confusing if you don't play the sequel, but it does not detract from the game, if anything, it makes it even more interesting and intriguing.  But the best thing about this game is the feeling of being a murderer. Not even kidding. They do this so perfectly, I don't know how they managed. The game has a pixel art style, and the violence is amazingly brutal, but the violence isn't as bad since it is in pixels.  I feel like this represents being a killer in the best way, the art style represents being desensitized to the violence around you, you care less about murdering these people in the brutal and horrific ways.  This, pared with the music, fills you will adrenaline and gets you wanting to kill a building full of people.  That one thing made me so happy to buy this game, it affectively made me connect with a character that is nowhere near related to me. This character doesn't even talk, and I got attached.  So, I believe if you like fast-paced brutal action, Hotline Miami is the game for you.",

            "review_text": "Hotline Miami is a classic example that you shouldn’t judge a game by its cover. First impressions from screenshots and videos may leave you thinking of it as a run of the mill, top-down shooter where you blast baddies with guns (with some ultra-violence mixed in); end of story. But if you aren’t familiar with what it actually  is , as I was not, then the reality is that Hotline Miami is something much more thrilling, intricate, and insightful than what your initial impression probably suggests. Not only is the action unique and fast paced, it is all accented with an outstanding soundtrack and surprisingly smart narrative in this stellar game by Devolver Digital.  Hotline Miami has you playing in late 1980's Miami, controlling a character who receives phone calls from a mysterious antagonist of sorts. Each phone call provides you with a target to assassinate, who is usually tucked away in a building behind all manner of bodyguards and thugs. Typically you start the level with no more than your fists, but you can steal melee weapons and guns from bad guys to unleash carnage more efficiently. As more missions are completed, newer masks (which can grant you passive buffs) are unlocked, as well as new weapons.   The brilliant twist in Hotline Miami is that enemies move and react at a breakneck pace, and your character dies in a single shot or melee hit. The result is that many levels will have you dying dozens of times if you want to run the level efficiently and with a good score -- thankfully Hotline Miami spends virtually zero time between your death and the start of your next run. Clearing a level feels like a perfectly orchestrated heist of brutality and cunning. It’s very similar to something like Super Meat Boy in that regard, but the gameplay itself is different in a very refreshing and unique way.  In most top-down shooters, you wouldn't expect much in the way of narrative. Hotline Miami doesn't have a stand-out narrative and it’s certainly not the focus here, but I was impressed with the way Devolver Digital used small environmental changes to make large implications to the player. These small breadcrumbs build up to a pretty compelling plot; I found myself attached to a character who speaks virtually no dialogue. It helps that the mood is set so perfectly in Hotline Miami; the music is absolutely perfect for every scene (and amazing on its own as well), and the gritty, colorful graphics create a very realized setting for the action taking place.  One thing worth mentioning is that Hotline Miami is an insanely brutal and violent game. It’s intentionally over the top and discomforting, and frequently your hand will be forced to perform some gratuitous acts against questionably innocent people without reason. What’s unexpected is that HM makes some extraordinary comments on violence in games for those who follow the relatively abstract story. For those interested who have beat the game (or don’t mind some spoilers), I would highly recommend reading Rami Ismail’s excellent article on Gamasutra entitled “Why Hotline Miami is an Important Game.”   That said, you don’t really need to care about the underlying message to enjoy Hotline Miami. It is a rollercoaster of high-octane, violence fueled fun, with some commentary if you care enough about it. The length and difficulty are just right, and it’s hard not to have a smile on your face as you slowly put together your perfect, bloody infiltration to the fantastic soundtrack. Truly, Hotline Miami is one of the most complete and enjoyable games you can play on PC today -- check it out.",

The idea is simple: you are a criminal and you need to do a number of missions which invariably consist in killing everybody in a building. You can use a wide range of weapons to do that, and even your bare hands.   Let's be clear: the plot is not a strength of the game. You will die several times (the easiest achievement to get for me was the 'Die 1000 times' one!), and in the process you will learn how to beat the levels. Basically, you need to learn how to ambush the enemies and kill them before they kill you.  Sounds boring, right? It's not! You will enjoy a fantastic soundtrack, you will try many ways to ambush your enemies, you will wear different masks which grant you different powers (such as more ammo, killing fists...), you will see a lot of blood (a lot!), and you will also have the chance to beat a few bosses. It took me roughly 7 hours to finish the game, and then there is a bit of replay value if you want to unlock all guns and masks to see everything that the game has to offer.  As far as I can tell, you cannot change the difficulty level and as I said, the game is hard (the number of deaths proves it) but fair. So... ready to kill?",

You play as a unnamed man but as the fans call him 'Jacket' every night you get strange cryptic phone calls from an unknown person telling you insturctions. Then you head into your car and go into a night of killing...  Hotline Miami is a fantastic game since it combines puzzle and action since guards hear gunshots and that melee weapons are silent. Be warned you will die quite a lot in this game cause it's pretty hard but fair at the same time. The enemy's are predicatable with linear patterns that you can use to your advantage but sometimes a guard might stray of his usual path throwing you off. Also there are many ways to deal with each level which makes the replay value quite high since you can either go stealth or go in guns blazing. The graphics fit the style of this game since it's drug induced and is set is the late 80's with lots of color and detail.   Cons: Framerate sometimes drops randomly when playing   Earl (Walrus) is glitched and you can't survive 2 bullets    In conclusion Hotline Miami is a great title to pick up on the Summer Sale and is worth the asking price 9/10",

            "review_text": "I can't remember when I bought Hotline Miami or how much I gave for it, but I honestly regret not playing it sooner. I also forget how long it took to finish and to get the secret ending, but I clocked in 10 hours to do all that and get a few additional cheevos.   Hotline Miami is basically Ultraviolence: The Game. Each chapter sees you as the brutally-violent 'Jacket' who dons an animal mask at the start of each level, who then proceeds to slay a bunch of guys in nice white suits while pulsing music plays through the brightly-colored rooms. You're going to leave one hell of a mess, but you have to do it without getting hit. Using the weapons lying around and in the enemy's hands (or your own bare hands), slaughter everyone. Die, and you have to restart the current floor no matter how many mooks' brains you left ground into the carpet before.   Hotline Miami plays like a twin-stick shooter with one stick or WASD to move, and the other stick or the mouse to aim. You don't have many actions but you honestly don't need much. You move at a set rate, you can move the camera slightly away from you to peek around the map, you can punch enemies down, you can finish off downed enemies, you can lock onto individual targets, you can pick up, use, and throw weapons, and you can interact with a few contextual things during your missions. You press R or the A button when you inevitably die to restart the floor. The game doesn't demand perfection but it does ask for accuracy, and being a few degrees off on your swing can be the difference between killing or being killed.   You might look at the screenshots and think the game a rather stylized stealth game. You can sneak around and off enemies with silent melee weapons, but the game encourages you to be reckless and ballsy with the scoring system. Playing it safe and going slowly will net you few points. Killing chains of enemies in a short time gives you bonus combo points, so be quick! Score high and you unlock new weapons and new masks which give minor bonuses like having lethal fists, moving faster, or making all guns silent. The game is very actiony and very fast-paced, and I'd honestly say it has some puzzle elements too. Enemies tend to stick to their rooms and some will patrol in set patterns, so it's a matter of how to dispatch them all quickly but safely. The game also slowly introduces new elements to keep the gameplay fresh, like doors to slam into enemies, or enemies that certain weapons won't work on, or windows that you (and the enemies) can shoot through. Trying to plan your next move while keeping all of these things in mind while your adrenaline's up is only part of the fun.   The story is...minimal, but the experience is very trippy and weird. You're some blonde dude wearing an animal mask and a letterman jacket (hence the nickname). You don't talk, you don't have a name, you just wake up, answer the answering machine, go to some place, and kill a bunch of people. You get a score tally, you unlock things, you go visit your friend at one of the stores he works at, and then you go home to repeat the process. It's a very arcadey experience since the story is so out of focus. You'll be left with plenty of questions if you stop to think...but who has time for that? You might be able to piece together the puzzle if you have an eye for detail.   While each chapter doesn't have its own unique song, the music really helps to get you in the killing mood. High-tempo music just goes well with the frantic pace of you moving through the rooms, mowing down scores of mooks. You might find yourself bobbing your head to the beat or tapping your foot or whatever. Then you get Chapter Clear and the music... stops.  Party's over, time to go home.   The game is pretty short. Most of your time with this game will be spent getting that 'perfect' run through each stage and chapter, so you'll be repeating content quite a bit until you stop dying. The game's hard, but I didn't think it crossed over from 'challenging but fun' to 'frustrating and disheartening.' The individual stages within the chapters are thankfully pretty short, so you rarely lose any big chunk of time to failure. If you're the type of person who likes to speedrun levels or try to beat your previous score or beat your friends' scores or are just an old-fashioned cheevo-♥♥♥♥♥, there's something here for you. And there's always some catharsis in cutting a bunch of mooks in half with a katana.   I'd like to think that Hotline Miami is well-deserving of its high praise, but it might not be a game for everyone. Some people might be turned off by the almost cartoonish pixelated gore they'd be creating, some people might not care for the whatever-genre-it-is music, and some people might want to snap their keyboards and controllers in half after dying for the 30th time in a row. For everyone else, it'll be a difficult but rewarding ride filled with lots of death. Maybe you  do  like hurting people.",

Hotline Miami is this generation’s Postal, but without the tongue-in-cheek preface, and even more indefensible in terms of its content. But that’s the point, really. Oddly reminiscent of Dreamweb (1994), if only for its top-down perspective and dark violence, Hotline Miami is a moment-to-moment heart-pounding pixel-perfect murder simulator.   A strange phone call with instructions in code sends you to a location: a house, a club, an apartment building. You choose which mask to wear (each one with special attributes), and try to kill everyone inside. Every shot is deadly, for both you and the mobster-types you decimate. Death is instant, often so fast only the “PRESS R TO RESTART” giving you a clue that you’re dead. Controls are simple, left click to attack (punch, shoot, stab), contextual to what weapon you have in your hands. Right click to pick up what’s on the floor, or to throw what you’re carrying.   The more creative you are in your spree, the higher the grade and score at the end of a mission. Score unlocks new masks, and new weapons that may drop from enemies (kinda like Super Crate Box).

For well under the 10€ you pay for this title, you get around 3-5 hours (give or take) of entertainment. Possibly less if you have extreme reaction times. Also, you get the soundtrack with the game(without artist names though, but I'm sure you'll figure that one out) bundled up into the game folder.

The design is impeccable, with the modernization of today's gameplay techniques and lack of censorship, blending harmoniously with the retro 80's aesthetic of yesteryear, which has always suggested something darker lies underneath.  The story, whether you choose to follow it or not, is very noir. Very arthouse slasher. The music is like the modern age is tapping an oil well into your primal instincts and just gets you pumped up to start murdering things, which I find particularly liberating. I highly recommend the soundtrack.  The game's strategies appeal to both the casual and the hardcore, and use the trial and error form of gameplay to teach players what works and what doesn't. If you want to use the guns as luring mechanisms so that the enemies come to easily and you can just slash them up with a knife, then you can. If you want to don the Tony or Brian mask and speedrun a level to get the highest possible score, then you can do that too. Whatever the case may be, anyone can play this game their own way, and that's the bread and butter of any game.  I personally found the hospital level to be gimmicky and dull, despite its attempt at being something of a story intermission. But all in all, this game will remain one of my favorites for years to come.  - Patrick Bateman",

And there's another more about the score challenge that mean it's not only about to finish the game. But this mean that you have to do some kind of time attack or combo kill too.  And the last thing that will be the good point for this game is about the music. That electro dance music in the madness, Blurry, High and skull cracking theme make this game is really sick. But it's cool!! cause it will pull out the game feeling in full emotion. you'll recieve the chaotic stuff in the game directly through the story of this game.  You have to try this game. Maybe it will make you puke like hell. But it's a good game",

            "review_text": "This game is frustratingly difficult, occasionally hard to control and sometimes confusing. But you know what? I had a blast with it throughout it's entirety. For me (I got the game on sale for 2.50$) this game was worth every penny, and would've been worth it even if I got it full price. Hotline Miami is a top-down beat em' up with a great soundtrack set in Miami in the 80s. This game was super fun to play, I found myself getting frustrated as enemies rushed me from every direction to kill me, only to not be able to put the game down. I would go through every level probably at least 20 times before I beat it, but it is so rewarding when you finally do beat it. Enemies are smart, they patrol the area in groups, if they see you they will rush to the place you just were, they will shoot you through glass even you didn't see. They are very challenging but never unfair. Using weapons is a trade off, guns give you range, but attract many enemies to your area, melee weapons are completely silent, but you have to get close to an enemy to kill them. There are also many ways to complete a level given the masks and your own personal preference. These masks (you unlock them by beating missions) give you a different stat boost, such as starting with a knife, more ammo, more guns, faster running, etc. This makes the levels extremely replayable, as on one run you can run faster and rush people with a melee weapon, on another you can spam a machine gun because of the extra ammo. This gives this short adventure many more hours than originally, and I'm sure coming back to play this game in the future would be amazing. I have to also commend the art-style and the music. Good god, both of these are SUPERB, as many indie games these days tend to be. The art-style lends itself a nice cartoonish style that is simple and easy on the eyes, yet still gets everything done, and done well. The music is also extremely great and fits the style of this game very well. I recommend purchasing or downloading this soundtrack because it it so dang nice. It fits this game as well as the FTL soundtrack fits that game. The control aspect is done alright, but it was a little weird to get use to. Locking on is almost essential for guns, but it is extremely tough to lock on to an enemy that is rushing you, which can lead to some annoying deaths. I'm not sure what could be done about this though, so I guess it was done the best it could've been. Last thing, the story is also very nice, confusing and inviting questions like the Five Nights at Freddy's, but with interesting characters and characters that you don't understand at first. No spoilers, but the ending is satisfying, you will be angry at characters in the game, and you will be confused by many of them. Hands down, this game is amazing, but if you get frustrated really easily this game might not be for you.",

This game has a good story, its not just about tearing some russians with bullets (it is.). It is basically : A man who is haunted by phone calls everyday continues to follow the phone call's orders, which say to kill some people, but in a casual way. For example, it would say that 'A receptionist is sick, can you come and fill in? Be dressed to KILL.'. The man hates these phone calls, and is also having hallucinations about the dead russians appearing on the streets of Miami. He then seeks revenge on SOMEBODY.",

This kind of gameplay and the visuals might not be your cup of tea, but if it is, boy are you going to enjoy it.  What interests me the most about this game is it's narrative. It revolves around a bunch of murderers with animals masks that kill russian gangsters, following orders of mysterious people leaving messages on their phones. The game is brutal, and it showcases a massive amount of extreme graphic violence, like executions, decapitations, broken bones, mutilated parts of the body, etc.  And, both the character and the player, enjoy it. Why would you be playing this game otherwise? 'Do you like hurting other people?'. This phrase is presented at an early stage of the game, and everything is based around this. Hunger for violence. In the music during the slaughter, the adrenaline rush, the gore, the sudden music stopping to see all the people you just brutaly murdered on the way out.  This game represents the most pure and hidden sadistic side of the people that play this kind of games. The desire to kill and destroy just by the pleasure of doing so.

You survey the area, come up with a plan, and then execute...all whilst leaving one hell of a mess in your wake.The story is extremely baffling and in my opinion, unless you've re-played Bioshock Infinite 50 times and learned how confusing plots should be masterfully pieced together then you should probably just search for the explanation online somewhere. Still a gory arcade action game for all people to enjoy.",

            "review_text": "Holy Hell, buy this game.  Sprinting through a three-story building owned and currently occupied by the Russian mafia wearing a latex animal mask, kicking in doors, firing full-auto SMGs and emptying both barrels of a side-by-side shotgun into a mafioso wearing a cheap white suit before picking up a pot of boiling hot water and pouring it over a guy's face while bass-bumping electronic music soundtracks the entire event. Then you're presented with the question; 'Do you enjoy hurting people?' This game won my heart from the very beginning and I've easily purchased 10 copies of it to give to friends that haven't tried it yet.   Pros: -Absolutely stellar soundtrack! It themes the game perfectly, and is incredibly catchy! -Art-style fits the motif well. From the 80s color schemes to the fonts used in the cutscenes and menus to the retro arcadey-style pixelated top-down camera angle. Everything screams what this game's setting is, and does so perfectly. -Combat is quick, dirty, and punishing. You need to figure out how best to clear every room of a building loaded with bad guys, which can boil down to what rooms you clear first, what mask you pick to do the job, what weapons you use at what time, and more. The AI patterns change occasionally, making every attempt a different animal. Devolver Studios made a move that to some might not seem important, but to me made the game make-or-break, and that is the 'R' To Restart button. If I were to have to watch a cutscene every time I died, or navigate a menu or something just to restart I would have put this game down long before I finished it. Luckily, being able to hit R to restart that section of the level as soon as I saw my corpse hit the ground made all the difference. It keeps things fresh, and keeps you hooked to the computer. You keep telling yourself 'Just one more respawn, I'll get it this time' and that is a sign of the game doing a good job at keeping you enthralled.   Cons: -Story really isn't fleshed out. While I consider what we have been shown of the story to be entertaining and intriguing, there are many people, myself included, who would like to have more fleshed out about the storyline of Hotline Miami. You're left with a lot of questions about what goes on in the game at the end of it that I can only hope they will address in some manner in the second game. I've heard the critique that Hotline Miami tries too hard to maintain a '2deep4u' storyline, and honestly I can see where people get that idea given the fact that quite a bit about the storyline is purposefully kept in the shadows.  -The pixel-graphics style is beyond played out in this day and age in PC gaming. Every developer and their grandmother is attempting to make a retro-styled pixel-graphic game. That being said, Hotline Miami does it right with clear and easy to read sprites and the fact that it's not another Metroidvania Rougelike like everyone else is putting out these days.  -Story line is a bit too short for me. I have finished the game multiple times in my relatively short amount of playtime in the game. Granted, the length of your playtime is going to be based upon how many times you've died, but at the same time I finished the game jonesing for more gameplay. The game holds some replay value with a hidden puzzle to collect pieces for and the fact that it's an entertaining gameplay formula regardless of story, but I can only help but feel like another couple missions wouldn't have hurt. That might just be my addiction talking though.  All in all, this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brilliant and I highly, highly recommend it. It holds a place in my heart for one of my favorite videogames of all time!",

            "review_text": "I have to let you guys know upfront that I'm really a fan of the 80s vibe. Seriously man, something about the pastel teal and pink puts the lead in my pencil. The very first time I saw Hotline Miami's menu, heard it's music, before I had even PLAYED the game, I was hooked. To my great relief, the actual game is just as dope as the aesthetic.  Gameplay in HM isn't particularly deep. You are dropped into an area and must kill every mother ♥♥♥♥er in there to advance. This is harder than it sounds: the face of death smiles on your character if an enemy so much as sneezes on him. You generally have to observe patrol patterns to formulate the most effective strategy. In my mind, I think of Hotline Miami as a puzzle game. Instead of moving blocks, you take lives in the most effecient manner possible.  The game grades you for your performance, and there are some sexy unlocks that are earned through high grades and exploration. At the start of each level, you choose which of your masks you will don. They all have a different effect of varying potency with the more powerful ones generally having to be found in their levels. You also unlock weapons and letters for a secret message (these must also be located). No spoilers, but it's in your best interest to try to locate those letters.  The story is surreal, chaotic and awesome. The game already has atmosphere in spades, the sharply written dialogue and trippy twists put it over the top. Basically, Drive: The Videogame, or at least how it looked from the Driver's perspecitve.  With everything else the game has going for it, I was surprised to find that my favorite part of the whole thing was the music. Seriously, the music in Hotline Miami is incredible. It would be incredible to listen to by yourself in a leisurely manner, but what makes it truly remarkable is how well it flows with the game. Try to play the game without music - you can't, really, truly can't. I cannot think of another game where this has been the case.  So, in closing, the game hits every bullet point. It can be frustrating, but is never dull. Occasionally shallow, but always fun. Extremely aesthetically pleasing, in both the graphics and music. A story you can sink your teeth into, and the gameplay to go along with it. Great experience for any gamer, provided they are not put off by the (extreme) 8-bit violence.  8.2/10",

            "review_text": "Hotline Miami is a fast paced top down... shooter, I guess? Personally, I played through most of the game by slamming peoples faces into doors. While there is a fairly solid plot, the game is of a fairly short length being able to be beaten in just a few hours, and most of the levels have little to no narrative. Effectively, the fun of the game comes from the fact you die if you get hit by anything. Any stray bullet or baseball bat to the face is lethal. Of course, this applies to enemies as well--with a few exceptions, mostly bosses--so combat tends to be, depending on your approach, either a puzzle, or a fast paced twitch shooter. The protagonist, Jacket, can also wear a variety of masks, gained through being found in the environment, and from progress in-game. Each mask gives a different ability, from making doors lethal, to giving you a knife to start with. The soundtrack, flashy visuals and high speed, brutal gameplay results in a consistant feeling of accomplishment for getting through every--fairly difficult--encounter. Failing is fast, and it only takes seconds to get back into the action. This is a game for speedrunners, and for people who like fast paced, intense action, along with rewarding, brutal, combat. Or for people who like to puzzle through things through trial and error.   The combat, general gameplay, music, and plot makes for a very enjoyable experience, and it's definitely a recommended buy if you like this sort of game. However, while the plot is servicable, and well executed, it's not stellar and not worth buying the game over.",

This is the game I played when I had overwhelming stress and needed to be rid of it quick and cleanly. While I would consider it a mindless top-down shooter, there is a bit of strategy involved in planning your method of attack. There is no 'health bar', this game is a one hit kill where even the slightest mistake will leave you writhing in pain with vengence. The selection of masks and guns only elevate the amount of unique approaches you can take to decimate the mobsters and their ring-leaders. For a game that I bought and played knowing no premise whatsoever, this was a pleasant delight of raiding homes and exercising the second amendment. 9\\10, -1 point for not enough gore.",

You'll be hearing it a lot and while I really like it, it might not be for everyone.  While the visceral top-down combat may be what the game is notorious for, the storyline is a nice addition and I appreciate the clever use of metaphor as an examination of types of player over a narrative that attempts to show us a world we don't need to understand, instead making the world a forum for debate through exposition and actions commited. The game itself can be a little trial and error based at times and isn't entirely free from bugs but it can be really fun regardless.  Do bear in mind however that the game offers fun gameplay but very little in replay value unless you're absolutely set on beating highscores on the same levels over and over. It would've benefitted greatly from the addition of a Steam Workshop integrated Level Editor. Even if it isn't that 'kind' of game. Maybe in the sequel we'll see something like that.  The bottom line is, essentially, if you're looking for a game you can waste time with for a while, Hotline Miami could be it. But don't expect it to last too long.",

The levels start off fairly simple, just a run in and shoot/slash up the place sort of affair, but as you progress the need to strategise increases, and you find yourself having to think carefully about the order in which you clear rooms. The faster and more efficiently you complete each level, the greater the score that you receive. This in turn allows you to unlock additional melee weapons and firearms, which then have a chance of spawning randomly in future levels (either on the floor of a room or in the hands of an enemy). I can't say I normally challenge myself particularly with video games, but because of the ease with which you are killed in Hotline Miami I found it exhilarating to burst through doors and hope I had taken the enemy by surprise.  The old school graphics are really awesome, and with the top-down style the visuals in Hotline Miami make me think of a cleaner-looking GTA. At the recommendation of other people I also bought the soundtrack, and I was definitely not disappointed. If you enjoy the sound of the music in the videos then I'd recommend purchasing the soundtrack.  I'm not 100% convinced I'd buy it again if it were full price (I bought it for $2.49) and I can't justify the soundtrack full price (also bought for $2.49), but this game is lots of fun so definitely pick it up while it's on sale!

The game itself is a lot of fun, and is a bit diffucult to get through but that's what makes it fun because there are so many routes you can take to take someone or a group out the quickest through a different route or weapon. The replay value isn't that much to get back into the game itself unless you are really into getting the fastest, or highest scores. There is an alter ending if you collect all the secret letter pieces aswell. The soundtrack is also pretty ♥♥♥♥ing great as trippy as it can get, from subtle noises to action packed fulled songs. if you are interested in it, I recommand getting the OST as you can listen to all of it and help out the dev aswell.  My only nitpick is that the game does feel a bit short and there isn't much after you beat it other than the secret alter ending. But hey, this game is pretty great and I can't wait to enjoy even more in the second one. To me, this is a solid game that is packed with neon colors with a story that unfolds as you wonder why are you killing so many people all the sudden while wearing weird masks. ",

I am not a fan of top-down shooters by far, I've actually avoided them. I acquired this game via a gift, and thusly spent 3 days without sleep playing it. The puketricide of 16-bit graphics melded with an advanced engine give it a feel that makes you feel that makes you believe you're always on some kind of violent drug. Gritty, Grindhaus, Psychadelic 'Malibu' type art style coupled with the kind of violence one would see in a Quentin Tarantino movie, and a soundtrack as varied and psychedelic as the game itself is displayed unbelievably well in pixelated form. The game was originally described as 'High-Octane' and thusly it surpassed that title and went above and beyond the reviews I originally read. It is a short game, but like a ♥♥♥♥ing bullet between the eyes, it leaves an impact. Story is compelling and and leaves you guessing, but simple, Gameplay is high-paced and balanced between forgiving and 'Bullet Hell with no Checkpoints.'

But you're never given a reason for your psychotic actions--the focus is on the joy of murder, and though Hotline Miami can be frustrating at times, its frantic gameplay and slick presentation make for some gloriously satisfying bloodshed.   The game opens with the nameless protagonist standing in a room. And, mysteriously, there are three men wearing animal masks making cryptic comments about your identity and actions. Is this real, or some drug-induced fever dream? You're not given much time to contemplate it. The screen fades to black, and you awake in a filthy apartment in April 1989. A bloodstained shirt lies in the hall as an answering machine light blinks on and off. This is the setup for most of the 19 chapters that make up Hotline Miami. A short message asks you to 'clean up' or 'visit' a certain address, which is followed by a trip to a building full of supposed criminals that you must slaughter floor by floor.",

            "review_text": "What is Hotline Miami? What does it do that captivates players? Is it the fast-paced action? Is it the violence? Perhaps, it's the music and 80s vibes. What presents Hotline Miami as such a special and visceral experience?    The game starts off in an apartment, located in an 80s Miami. You control an unidentifiable person (he stays anonymous throughout the entire experience). He receives an abrupt phone call from a number that goes under “Tim's Bakery”, but is implied to be a hitman service. The player is told to open up the box of “cookies” and an “ingredient” list, on the nearby doorstep. Rather, the character finds a rooster mask and a list of information on a certain target. You are instructed to take the target out, extract his briefcase, and rid it in an alleyway dumpster. After going to the location, beating faces to a pulp, ridding the briefcase, and ending another life, the main character bends over and profusely vomits. This shows that he's disgusted with what he's done. This moment defines where Hotline Miami truly takes initiative with its story.     As our once-innocent denizen eats away at Miami's population of crackheads, he starts to relish it. Ideally, this is shown through the gameplay and subtle progression of the main character. He learns new styles of killing, takes on bigger amounts of mobsters, and evolves into a complete psychopath. You see the damage you've done and the lives you've taken, as a blood-soaked protagonist walks back out of every area he's obliterated. It really provides for an effective atmosphere and unsettling set of emotions. That's just a prime example of what makes Hotline Miami so powerful.     Each style is earned through receiving new masks by level completions, high scores, and achievements. There are a variety of mask styles to choose from, and they truly tip the re-playability scale. For example, you could choose the “Brandon (panther)” mask. This mask makes the character run faster. Players could also use the “Zack (frog)” mask, which allows for a larger combo window. As killing goes, there are different ways to go about taking down your targets. One can go in guns blazing. Or, they could take a slower, melee-based attempt. The levels are designed for players to take multiple, different attempts in each playthrough. As they progress through this game with discomforting repletion, they will soon realize how short it actually is. This twisted Miami tale could be described best as a one-day visit to a favorite theme park.    Through pulsing, bass-hitting beats, this game ensures that you'll be killing in style. From synthwave rings to dark electronic throttles, one will be consumed by the soundtrack's flaring and bold atmosphere. M.O.O.N, Perturbator, Scattle, and Jasper Byrne are a few artists involved with providing this. The soundtrack is truly one of HM's strong suits.    The genius story telling, the brutality, the gore, the neon-soaked 80s aesthetic, the atmosphere, the subtle implications of the main character, and the soundtrack make Hotline Miami art. Some say games cannot be art. In my eyes, they truly can. This indie game takes a brutal and shocking concept, and does it in a surprisingly un-edgy way. We take control of a character that has everything stripped away from him, as he's brainwashed into killing everything in sight. As he's subjected to the gruesome nature, he begins to adjust to it. The tailoring of the human mind is expressed in his story, and the game should be appreciated for what it presents. Hotline Miami is a special gaming experience that every gamer should try.  8.5/10   TL;DR Get the damn game.",

I know if you play this game (AND LISTEN TO THE SOUNDTRACK) you will grow to love it as much as I do. Please purchase this masterpiece and support the developer so we can get more games like this. If you are to purchase just one game today, make it this one. Once again I thank you for taking the time out from your busy schedules to read this review.  Yours in gaming, Dubgame.",

The gameplay is swift and keeps you on your toes, the controls are easy to learn and are responsive, the story is interesting (though very confusing, the second game completes the puzzle mostly) and the aforementioned soundtrack is just the cherry on the top. The game is rage-inducingly difficult, but as you complete the levels and obtain new masks and weapons the game becomes slightly easier (still very difficult though). My only complaint is that   there only two characters to play as,   but the second game addresses this completely.

        {
            "review_text": "This game is a gem of a top-down, 2D action game. A bloody, gore-covered, fast-paced, action-filled gem. You take control of the 'protagonist' named 'Jacket', as he responds to otherwise mundane tasks given to him by anonymous callers by going to the given address and murdering the life out of everyone while wearing an animal-themed rubber mask. Oh, and he has episodes where he's mentally accosted by what we can only assume are his spirit animals.  The old-school art style suits the game well, as does the music. Everything seems appropriately trippy, given Jacket's psyche and mental condition. There's a lot of blood and violence involved, so if you're squeamish about literally pixelfulls of blood, bones and brain littered about your screen, then bully for you.  Stages usually consist of a building full of baddies for you to viciously murder, which is then divided by floors/areas. Transitioning from floor to floor also serves as much-needed checkpoints. Stages are completed when all enemies have been thorughly disassembled. At the end of each stage, a score is calculated based on your performance, which in turn is based on time taken to complete the stage, combo kills, etc. etc. Higher scores means faster weapon unlocks and validation for your l33t skillz.  Most enemies you encounter will be of the bald, white-coat-wearing, squishy and esily killable variety. Later on, dogs, rotund, stripe-coated gangsters and SWAT guys will enter the fray. Boss fights are also going to happen. Deal with it.  You have a vast arsenal of weaponry at your disposal to aid you in your murderous rampage, ranging from mundane frying pans and pool cues to assault rifles and shotguns. Fisticuffs are an option as well, however a solid punch will only ever temporarily knock down an enemy, requiring you to perform an execution to finish the sucker off.   Melee weapons usually get the job done in one good hit, and vary in terms of swing/attack speed and effective range. They can also be thrown at enemies with varying degrees of effectiveness, depending on your aim and type of weapon thrown: most thrown melee weapoins will knock enemies down, while bladed weapons like knives and shuriken can kill. Pick these goodies up from fallen foes.  Ranged weapons are obviously great at taking foes out from a distance, and differ in terms of damage done per bullet, bullet spread type, accuracy, ammo capacity and noisiness. Guns make a lot of noise, often attracting the attention of other enemies and making them rush you, which can quickly put you in a bad spot if you run out of ammo. Again, these can be collected from the corpses of slain baddies.  Masks can be collected along the way, allowing you to accessorize to your heart's content before heading in for a night of killing. Each mask offers different and not-insubstantial perks that might suit your play style, so choose wisely to avoid a possible fashion faux pas.  Your environment isn't just for show, either. Take advantage of your surroundings by luring enemies into narrow corridors and mowing them down with gunfire, or waiting for them to walk by the corner where you eagerly await with your meat cleaver held high. Doors are a godsend, and will quickly become your enemies' worst nightmare, as you gleefully slam doors into their faces and laugh as they sprawl on the ground before murderizing them.   Make no mistake, Hotline Miami is pretty damn difficult. You will die often, most of the time in a manner that would have you cussing and cursing at your monitor like a sailor who's terrible at video games. The difficulty ramps up nicely as the game progresses, oftentimes courting the line between stupidly hard and downright unreasonable.  A lot of trial and error is involved, as the AI can be frustratingly inconsistent. It is very difficult to accurately predict how enemies will move or react (ex. enemies doing nothing while you take out enemies standing right beside them VS gun-wielding enemies instantly turning around and blasting you to hell as you stalk past them), forcing you to adapt your chosen strategy as you go, or, when you've died enough times, make you resort to bashing the movement keys and the attack button, mentally broadcasting pleas for success to your preferred deity. Getting killed means that you have to start the floor all over again, an experience which is exactly as soul-crushing as it sounds.  This, however, doesn't mean that the game isn't good. Keyboard and mouse controls work wonderfully, and the game's mechanics are sound enough that you won't get killed unfairly at the hands of anything other than the sometimes questionable AI. There is a palpable and genuine sense of accomplishment when you complete a level, and the story is genuinely interesting, if mildly obscure.  Bottomline: if you dont mind pixel ultra-violence and are looking for a challenge, get this game. FIN  ",

Pros: - Amazing story, plot twists, .... - Variety of arsenal, i killed a guy with a freaking dart ! - The music is designed per level, which means that it's a big variety of songs - Gore, gore and more gore !  Normal : - If you die you start off from the last checkpoint made by the game, it's not something that bothered me but still could be eased off for the newbies.  Cons: - AI are to OP sometimes, might make you rage  - Boss fights might ♥♥♥♥ up your level playthrough - Door bugs while fighting with AI's  Despite the cons which are things that i've read from other people's reviews and my personal opinion, I would like to rate this game a 9.5/10  A true masterpiece for an Indie game!",

            "review_text": "Really great game. It follows a really cool 80's style with gory fast-paced gameplay, along with a decent storyline. The game is a lot of fun, and I've really done all you can do here, so I'll be a better guide for whether to buy this game or not.   First off, this game has some really fun gameplay. It focuses on a ranking system, where you unlock masks that give little bonuses and special weapons you can find spawn in missions. These masks give some replayablity since getting every single one gets hard to do and each has their own fun strategy. Other than that, it gives a really fast paced game where all you have to do is clear each room. It sounds simple, and it is, but it's all about learning the timing and the best way to kill each enemy, and becomes pretty easy to beat each level once you learn the idea of how to beat it. Now, I think that actually also adds replayability because the 'hard' games like Dark Souls has it to where it's always hard, and it's less about getting the timing right and more about learning how to fight, which is just improved as you play the game, and no matter what any point in the game will be managable once you learn it, instead of constantly learning in the 'hard' Hotline Miami and putting it into play later on a second playthrough. The story is pretty good, but there isn't much to say about it. After you start playing the game a second time, you start to search for all masks, and in the process, collecting all of the letters in the levels (collectables). The really cool thing about this is that when you complete the game a first time, you don't really know what happened and what's going on, and why it happened; when you collect all of these letters and find out a secret code you figure out the game's world and everything there is to know, and it's really satisfying.  This game is just made well, and you can see it. Everything feels really exciting and you actually sometimes can get scared, or amused, or angry, and it feels good. No matter what you experience, there is always a sense of acomplishment once you finish the fair levels, and it's really nice. It makes you want to play more until there is no more missions, and it doesn't stop there, like I said before. The replayability in this game is a good relief since the story can be beaten in like 8 hours, and beating it again takes like 6 hours if you go for completionist second playthough. I am really glad I have these hours and so are most people, and it's really an experience everyone should get to feel.",

The story is a lot more complex then that but im to lazy to type all that. I give the story a 1.8/2 Gameplay: At the begining of each level you choose a mask each mask give you a diffrent ability for example one will give you and insta-kill punch and another will give you quieter guns. You can unlock more by beating a level, beating a high score or finding them hidden throughout some of the levels. Its fun to go through a level mutiple times with a diffrent mask to try and beat you previous score. The actual game play consist of you going into a building and kiling some thugs, you are just as easy to kill as they are so while there is some strategy most of it will be you not even thinking about what your doing and just running in guns blazing and you will die alot. There are one or two boss battles that require more thinking but arent to hard to beat and are at the perfect level of challenge. I give the gameplay a 2/2 Visuals: The pixe art in this game is pleasing to look at and throw in some neon lights, blood, and big glowing words and you have a visualy pleasing game. 2/2 Soundtrack: Holy Cow the music in this game is extremly good. In fact its probaby the main reason for anyone to buy this game. 2/2 Replaayability: The story is really linear but after you beat it you unlock a side story and some bonus levels, and you could stil go back and collect some maks and hidden objects that you missed during your first play through. 1.5/2 Tl;DR Press R To Restart",

This is something i normally don't pay attention to in games while i play but this game has THE BEST soundtrack playing while you beat the crap out of bad guys. Seriously if they sold their soundtrack i'd buy it and listen to it all the time  Basically if you're looking for a good difficult game to paly this is truely it. The music makes it better.

You can do so, by killing them with guns, melee attacks, slamming doors open, throwing objects etc. It is really satisfying when you get to clean a level, which you tried over and over again.  But even if you fail, you just hit a button, and start over again. The pacing is very high, so it doesn't get too frustrating (imho) as you can hop in right away and start over again quite fast.  At the beginning of each level, you can choose one mask which will give you a specific bonus (starting with a knife, moving faster, walking silent etc )  Really good 'old-school' game! If you can handle frustration and repeated attempts, and you're somewhat skilled then give it a try.",

The gameplay isn't anything innovative or spectacular for a top-down action game, but the fast-paced simplicity allows for an enjoyable, trance-inducing pace, that when combined with the soundtrack, makes for an unforgettable psychedelic experience. On that note, the game is obviously cheaply made, and the soundtrack is the real star of the show and the saving grace.  All around, totally worth playing, but not worth 10 bucks, and somewhat undeserving of the suicide commando cult following it has garnered.  ",

After having this game forced upon me by my peers, I'm still in awe that so many people refer to it as the greatest top-down shooter in recent memory. Did it really blow you away? Is the story really that impressive? Well, let me ask you this? How can you like a game that is so completely irrelevant that it might as well have been produced in the 1970's? This game at no point deals with homosexual relationships, or even has a single homosexual character. It never deals with the issue of the gay homeless youth, or features a dominant transgender main character. Video games by definition should push boundaries, and HM does nothing more than force the traditional straight, cisgendered agenda down our throats. Shame on you for playing this, and shame on those hipster ♥♥♥♥ devs for not dealing with LGBT issues head on.    I'm honestly ashamed to live in this country now.  The gameplay is very fast and tense, basically everything is a oneshot unless you are fighting boss characters, the graphics and artstyle fit the gameplay so i have nothing to complain about.  On release there were some bugs where i couldn't enter my car or couldn't even see my car which was a pain but seems to have been fixed. A lot of the replay value comes from finding the secrets and gaining A+ ranks as well as getting them masks. My favorite mask is that pink panther mask which makes you run faster because it meant i could keep my melee combos up and reach people although if you really want high scores Zack is a good bet. I really enjoyed this game and what i said above was a joke.  Decided to revise this just so people can see more people recommending the game.",

Little did I know that for the rest of that week I would finish the game and spend countless hours getting each and every little achievement hidden in this masterpiece. The replayability of Hotline Miami is incredible, especially for a game developed by only two guys. The gameplay may seem a bit samey at first, but the more you play it, the more you start to develop your own little strategies. Never once did I need to consult the internet about a part where I didn't know what to do or how to do it. This is one of the game's strongest points. The premise is very simple: kill all Russians. This allows for very steamlined and fast-paced gameplay. You know what to do, you know how to do it, now do it. Not that this game is easy. On the contrary, getting a perfect score on each stage was one of the hardest gaming experiences I've had to date. The music is also brilliant. It fits the gameplay very well. Tracks like Hydrogen and Perturbator in particular really steal the show in this regard. This is in my opinion one of the only games that really deserves to have its own OST for sale on Steam. This is honestly my favourite game I've played this year, and I'm really looking forward to Hotline Miami 2.",

Then boy has Devolver Digital have a game for you. Hotline Miami is a top down shooter, pixelated, bloody, rage inducing pile of awesome. There is no real way to do the exact same thing twice in this game as many things change if you replay the level such as: Enemy positions, Weapon positions, and Weapons in general. This causes intense amount of replay value as levels become crisp and new everytime you do one again. The music in this game is fantasic. It's like a mixture between late 80's techno/disco with hints of dubstep sprinkled on top. I recommend this game alot.",

Hotline Miami is easily one of my favourite games of all time. It's blind, meaningless violence, but in a way that gives you a rush. You have to think quickly, and the game makes sure to keep you on your toes with it's pacing, which I don't even know where to start on, how many times have killed me. It's got a story too, which is both unsettling and compelling, once you start to look closely at things. The gameplay, and last but not least, the MUSIC, man. The music adds the biggest 'yes' factor for me.   Try it out. It's hardly very expensive. Well worth the buy.",

            "review_text": "Hotline Miami is a top down indie arcade game developed by Dennaton Games and published by Devolver Digital. This is the first game developed by the three man team at Dennaton but Devolver Digital are well known for bringing classic legends like Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior to the modern market. The fact that they’re publishing Hotline Miami is a fairly big deal and hopefully it will add to the reasons why people should love this game.  You play as a hitman for a Russian mob in Miami Florida in 1989. Not much is revealed at the start, but as the game progresses you start to uncover more about the story. I don’t want to spoil anything, but there are a few twists and turns that will keep your interest. The story is basic, but it’s riddled with mystery, tragedy, betrayal, and questions upon questions upon questions.  So in terms of gameplay, everything is played from a top down perspective. The controls are fairly basic, moving around with WASD and aiming with the mouse. Each level requires you to kill all enemies before proceeding to the next area and doing the same thing. Once all enemies are dead, you win. What keeps the game varied is the vast amount of weapons you can use and the random drops they have on each level. You also get a large selection of masks to choose from at the start of each mission. Each of these masks has a different perk such as quiet gunshots or starting the level with a knife. As you complete levels you unlock more masks but there are also hidden collectibles (including a few super secret masks) to find.  The game is very difficult. Enemy AI is very responsive and it just takes one gunshot/melee attack to kill you and force you to start the level again. As I was playing, I found myself doing the same parts over and over trying to complete it. There are different tactics you can use and getting to choose a mask can sometimes make things much easier, but prepare yourself for a real challenge.  The soundtrack to Hotline Miami is incredible. I absolutely loved the original score composed by several different well known artists such as Jasper Byrne, M.O.O.N., and Perturbator. It really works with the reckless violent gameplay, and kept me playing the game even when I felt like throwing my computer out the window.   Length wise, I completed the main story in about 3 hours. A few parts gave me hell so it might take a more experienced player 2 hours or less. There is an epilogue story that adds a few more levels onto the main story, but don’t expect to spend more than 5 hours to finish. Despite this short amount of time, there is a lot of replayability. Collecting all the collectibles and masks will take some time and trying to get the best possible score for each level is a good challenge. There are also several achievements that will help keep you occupied while replaying parts of the game. I estimate someone interested in this game could get 8-10 hours in total, but the gameplay is so addictive that many people will probably replay the game just for the experience.  Hotline Miami is a great indie gem that in my opinion, no one should miss. It’s fairly priced for what you’re getting and definitely not something that the average gamer will forget playing.   My final verdict is 88/100. I wanted a longer story with perhaps a few more enemy types, but apart from those things, I really enjoyed everything about the game!  ",

(the last one was so bad) Enemys would get stuck on top of me. and in result would insta kill me when i tried to move away.  But if you can live with clunky controls. sure this game is great fun. dont buy it at full price though.

Really fun and addictive top down shooter with lots of blood and gore. It has that Super Meat Boy feel to it where you die in the first few seconds, hit the restart button and then die again... By getting good scores you unlock more weapons aswell as new masks that give a bonus during a level, like running faster or being able to tank more damage.   The music is really awesome and gets you pumped up, just in the right mood to plow through a room of baddys. The overall feel of the story, delivered in very short dialogues between missions is pretty cool. It goes from a relatively happy, carefree world into a bad one where suddenly you see corpses everywhere. It's quite effective given how short the sequences are.  Speaking of short... The biggest downside is the length: I beat the main story in 2 hours and another hour for the bonus story. I'm guessing that finding every single puzzle piece in each level unlocks another story sequence, but all in all the game remains very short.

I was eating it in my vehicle in the parking lot and listening to an audiobook when I glanced up and saw the McDonald's worker I ordered outside having a cigarette. She waved at me and I nodded and had to wait 7 minutes before she went back inside and I could eat in comfort again. I don't think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the McDonald's restaurant or drive through, but that is another story. I went to McDonald's for dinner tonight and got a McChicken combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side. As I was driving to the second window the same girl was still working. She was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked, 'why don't you come eat inside instead of in the parking lot'. That really bothered me for many reasons. First of all, I don't want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee. Secondly, she should not try to tell me how I should live my life. I do not want to eat inside because I find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy. Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each drive through visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of faux pas. Which I don't think I did, because I often see people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush? ",

What happens is that you can take like 5-10 minutes to beat a level, but when you do beat it perfectly it may only take like 15 seconds which is pretty cool. What I really like is at the end of a level you go back through the parts you've played and get to survey all the damage that has been done. It really makes you feel like an 80's movie action badass. The game also has a lof of unlockable masks (which grant you different boosts/abilities) and weapons that will keep you playing after the game is over (its really not too long). Seeing as how its already gone down to 5 bucks consider picking this game up now, or if/when it gets cheaper in the future.",

Nevertheless, great game, even better music. It's like a puzzle game more than a top-down action game.

Cerntainly all the strange symbolism means something? Another note, this game looks dirty. I don't mean dirty as in 'lots of blood' or even in a sexual sense. The soundtrack along with the art design makes me feel like I need a shower because of playing it. Which is good, considering the tone of the game. But as I said, this game asks serious, philisophical questions. The most prominent being 'Do you enjoy hurting people?' and, at the end of the day, I can answer this for certain. Yes. I loooove hurting people. 8/10 great way to spend an entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ day.",

In the vast majority if cases, I would say that Video Games are not Art. But Hotline Miami has changed that for me.   Hotline Miami blends colour with music like no other game I have ever played. Its harsh, rapid beat mixed with the pschycadellic Imagery immerses one fully into the Miami Underworld of the 1980s. The Gameplay, although frustrating, works extremely well and the graphics prove that even pixelated games can be beautiful and powerful. The Story is convoluted and complex, and without understanding what exactly was going on, I enjoyed the well-paced plot and interesting dialogue nonetheless.    Is it frustrating, and rage-enducing? Yes. But it is also a game that, no matter how often I complete, I always come back to, ready for another Trip to Miami.  All in all, Hotline Miami remains a fantastic experience that I am glad to have experienced. But dont let me need to tell you. Buy the game and let the sensation you will feel decide.  9/10.",

There is hardly any plot, and it was intended to be like that. It is raw gameplay at its best. At the beginning of each level you get a phone call telling you to kill someone and then you are off. You always just start out with your fists and a powerup mask of your choice, and are expected to kill dozens of people in order to get to your goal. Probably my favourite part about this game is once you kill everyone and win the level, the soundtrack just stops playing and is replaced by just some unerving long drawn-out music notes. You look around at everyone you killed and you dont see just pixels on a screen, you see actual people. Some how this game makes killing seem so realistic, much more so than any triple A games. One last thing I should mention: the soundtrack. It perfectly captures the feel of the game, and is one of the best soundtracks I have ever listened to.  Pros +Gameplay +Soundtrack +Violence +Price +Varitety of weapons  Neutral *Story  Negitive -Length (I really wish it was a bit longer!

(If you're one of those politically correct wusses then please feel free to drop the soap of comformity as you would normally)  Hotline Miami is a top down shooter or 'f*ck 'em up' as some describe, caked in gore with wet little bits of meat all over the place. Set in 1980s Miami you, a nameless hitman receiving strange anonymous calls on your answering machine must eliminate everyone you come across, oh and you have one life to do it in otherwise, 'Press R to restart' just as an enemy whacks your head in with a lead pipe.   The gameplay is quite challenging to anyone new but you get into the swing of things early on in game, hell even I  beat the game in under an hour , the difficulty of the game can be off putting at first but once you get used to it, cutting someone into neat little pieces with a katana is a great stress reliever and arguably gets easier the more times you do (don't try this one at home kids). On a side note, going in guns blazing is exactly what the game was designed for so don't be all stingy with your ammo except when you're faced with the fat black dudes.  The story is immidiately reminiscent of Tarantino movies, in the sense that they're someone going to die soon and violently but that's where the similarities end, it is ambiguous to the greater extent whether this is all just one big acid trip, in a coma or you're just plain mad. Ultimately not having all the answers adds to the game's trippy feel since the final secret ending lacks a bit.  The sound and visuals tie in together beautifully as the soundtrack is one of the finest ever made, the rhythm of the neo 80s tunes are perfectly in sync with your massacring which, although is presented 8-bit style, your mind just fills in what the graphics don't detail enough for you, besides adding a bit of character to the game as well. The rooms you're in also appear to wobble with constantly changing warm colours that melt away in the background, it makes you wonder just what on Earth you're character's been eating.  All in all, the violence, the acidic visuals, indescribably good soundtrack and mysterious story create a trip unlike any you've been on before or ever again after. Until the sequel came along that is. One small criticism was that this game ends way too quickly for the moderately skilled like me.",

Gameplay wise it has more in common with the original rainbow six series than any other top down shooter. Planning, speed and precision are necessary in a game where a single misstep will cost you everything. This title really shines when it comes to the sound and ambiance. Everything is done up in a garish 80's themed neon and the music really helps communicate the feeling of disjointedness and confusion throughout the game. Some minor issues with the AI detection and uncertainty mar this title somewhat. The storyline overall was honestly a bit off putting once I got to the end and looked up what the extra ending was but I still found the experience to be largely positive taking all these issues into account.",

I find the setting of the game charming as I'm a mark for 80's nostalgia. Hotline Miami is casual pick up and play fun, and for the price you can't go wrong. For an indie game I give it 4/5 stars, my only complaints being:  1. Targeting enemies can be cumbersome in the heat of battle.  2. I couldn't help but feel there should have been at least a ninja or two in the game as a nod to the awesomely awful 1980's movie 'Miami Connection'   Bottom line, if you're looking for a 2D game with 1980's nostalgia and some GTA style grit, give Hotline Miami a try.",

The colours are all hypnotic 80's vibrant fluro reds, pinks and greens and fit with the time period perfectly. There's a real sense of uneasiness about this game as you converse with faceless people in pig and horse masks, asking you questions like, 'Do you enjoy hurting people?'. The games difficultly harkens back to the old days of brutally hard Sega and Nes titles where one hit means you're dead, that's it, start the level again. There's an achievement for dying 1,000 times, I hit it at just over 5 hours (mind you I also hit the achievement around the same time for killing 1989 enemies so it's balanced out).

And now with the summer sale 2015 I decided to buy the game and jesus christ it was fun. I'd never imagine me playing a game like this but when I start it's hard to stop.   The game takes place somewhere in the 2000 century and you play as some psyco dude getting phone messages telling you to go to various locations. Before you enter the building/area you get to choose from diffrent types of masks, each has unique abilities and effects on how you play. For example my favorite, Graham which is a rabbit mask and it gives you a speed bonus.   The gameplay is phenomenal, personally I prefer melee combat because it's much cooler smashing in heads and cutting of arms. And there are SO many weponds to choose from. You can use anything from a Katana to a Whiskey bottle. And all weponds has it's unique moves, damage and effects. There is not much of a story here but the gameplay is what matters. after each and before every mission/level you have a cutscene which is relative to the story and the developers has put diffrent clues around these cutscenes which can give you an idea what the story is about.   Final Verdict  8/10  Stunning gameplay and you get to kill russians.",

From there, every component of the game, from graphics to music and gameplay can then be crafted to create a greater, more unified whole. I think that this is one of the ways that you can make a truly great game.  'Hotline Miami' succeeds in this way in an astounding fashion. It is a frenetic fever dream, combining twitch gameplay with tight level design, fitting aesthetics, and a killer soundtrack. 'Hotline' does particularly well with atmosphere, creating an immersive and bloody acid trip. It's easy to lose oneself in the hypnotic beats and waves of psychedelia that surround this game.  To be fair, 'Hotline' isn't a game for everyone. It is difficult and can be frustrating. The player can sometimes die from bullets fired from off-screen or by running into the same bad scenario again and again until they solve it. But it's for these reasons that 'Hotline' also succeeds, much for the same reasons that 'Super Meat Boy' did. Despite its difficulty, the punishment for failure is rather small. The player respawns almost instantly, giving them a second, third, or hundredth chance at murder.   My first playthrough of 'Hotline Miami' shortly after its original release was one of my most refreshing experiences in gaming. I can't recommend that everyone should play this game enough, even if it's only to see what happens when you don't try to do too much and instead focus on what makes your game excellent.",

In the sense that you play along, you're slaughtering thug after thug and you get into this comfortable rhythm of just wiping out dudes, when all the sudden? It starts throwing these increasingy surreal story elements at you that very jarring and unexpected. You get so drawn in because all the sudden, the gameplay has another level of depth to it. It gives you more of a reason to care about what you're doing, rather than just mindless killing. It even starts to guilt you in a way, with the infamous line 'Do you like hurting other people?'  I highly reccomend it, though it definately requires some patience. You WILL DIE. REPEATEDLY. AGAIN AND AGAIN. DEATH. REPEATING. But it's quick to take you right back into the action, and actually REWARDS you for being more and more reckless. If you've got the time and a love of Neo-80's synth music, you'll love this game.

Now for the heart of the review, the  Pros   and   Cons :  -   Pros:    Wonderful music   Amazing pixel art style   Great level design   A unique Mess-with-your-brain story   Excellent 80's character designs   Loveable characters   Great character dialogue   Cons:    Can be hard as balls at times and trying to beat a single level for a hour can take you out of the immersion fairly quickly   BS controls at times(like getting stuck on doors and whatnot)   A missing .dll file for updated mode(I really don't know how to fix this)   if you're like me and want to skip through the main menu to get straight into where you left off, you may restart the story mode again just because you didn't notice the 'continue' button under the 'start game' button(more a failure on the player's part, but most people assume the continue button is on top like how a lot of game's menus are)   Worthless masks  If you like 2D top down games and 80's film-like games, this is the game for you.   Now  I  have a question for you;  Do you like hurting people? ",

It could be one of the best games ever, if it hadn't technical and control issues. If you can't tell when a game has FPS way below the refresh of a decent monitor and aren't bothered by control issues, the game might be for you, if you are bothered by those, I'd only recommend the game, if you have a saint-like frustration tolerance.  the good: - interesting, trippy 'story' - imaginative, visceral kill animations - kinda skillbased combat mechanics - satisfying feeling when you get better and do cooler stuff - good replay-value - price below 1€/$/£ when in sale - no lading times after each numerous death - interesting violence-based humour - many masks/weapons to unlock, not too grind-heavy - amazing soundtrack, good sound effects  the bad: - very random enemy AI. Sometimes they see and shoot you while being far out of your max vision reach. Othertimes they stand next to you and do nothing.  - special 'stealth mission with no killing' is very annoying - some enemies are magically invulnerable to certain attacks - w/o any explanation - can't save mid-mission; so it's easy to lose 10+ minutes of gameplay if you have to leave  the ugly: - FPS lock - mousecursor is virtually invisible with all the trippy colors and stuff going on - terrible controls. not only because you can't rebind keys, but the character moves as he's on ice, sliding and not being very precise. - same silly, semi-unskippable cutscene plays in certain levels. As you might have to retry maps dozens of times, it really gets annoying fast.",

There are a variety of weapons at your disposal as well as masks the player can choose at the start of each level- These can either buff or handicap you, so you have to change up your playstyle depending on which one you choose to don.   You can choose to be sneaky and take out the baddies one at a time, but the game rewards you with recklessness. To get a high score and rating; you must chain together combos, and use different weapons every so often.  YOU WILL DIE A LOT in this game but it's as easy as pressing 'R' each time and the game immediately puts you at the beginning. No loadtimes after death so you can jump right back into the action and change up your strategies.  Now to the music, well... it's amazing, it pumps you up and is a mash up of dance and electronic music. Along with the trippy visuals the music ties in well with the game.  The Story is not uniform but random and obscure, it makes the game interesting. Each chapter has multiple stages and they always begin with the protagonist in his apartment, reading a message on his answering machine about the mission, and him driving to the stage.   I recommend this game, it has a lot of secrets and unlocks so there is replay value, and to my knowledge this is the only game that has this kind of flare.  ",

Each map presents the player with a bright and engaging enviromental canvas to paint with the nigh neon color of criminal blood. This game is as brutal as it is bright, nearly every thing can kill you as easily as you can kill it. The array of masks can add to slow your near constant death cycle out increase challenge adding a layer of depth to the normally straight forward combat.  Speaking of, combat as mentioned above is fairly simple to grasp Kill or Be Killed. While most weapons are obvious: Guns and Pipes, sometimes you might find something surprising to lodge into the skull of the men unlucky enough to round a corner you're behind. Though I would be doing a misservice if I didn't mention that sometimes you die needlessly due to an excess of windows or an enemy, who had only been knocked down during a frenzied spray of bullets, bury his pipe in the back of your head. One other complaint being that on occasion the 'predictable' enemies seemed to either be too dumb for their own good or suddenly gain the reaction time of Spider-man, though this sort of thing didn't happen enough to become more then a momentary annoyance   The story may not appeal to every one, it is rather then but provides all the motivation one needs to sprint about in a fury to get that one last kill for a combo. However, the story has its moments where it is a flawlass descent in to a bloody hysteria.   I chose this game to recommend for the interesting story, tight gameplay, but most of all because of its grim and brutal combat contrasted with a world alight with neon.",

            "review_text": "“Follow protocol and we’ll all make it out alive,” says a boss character in one of Hotline Miami’s later missions. It’s a perfectly reasonable thing for him to say to his henchmen. All who hear him probably think it’s good advice, wisdom dispensed to survive an impending attack by you, a relentless killer. So they follow orders and do what they’ve been trained to do. Some stand with guns, some patrol rooms with knives, and all are ready to slash and shoot and murder the intruder in a bloody font of insta-death. Yet none who heard the order appreciate its irony. They don’t comprehend that by following protocol they follow the game rules that you've learned to overcome, and that by complying with their boss set themselves up to have their brains splattered against the wall and organs spilled across the floor.  Dennaton Games’ Hotline Miami is stuffed with moments like this that stir up identity and purpose into a neon-lashed, ultraviolent, self-aware skewering of video game conventions and the nature of entertainment. Lynchian scenes of surrealist intrigue pop up right at the very beginning as masked figures ridicule you about events they never explain, immediately and succinctly establishing a sense of distrust. The nonstop flux of pinks and purples wrapped around the edges of every playable area, the grainy waves washing across the retro visuals and sublime soundtrack where reverb bleeds from fat synths over electronic beats aren’t solely for style, but mesh perfectly with the sense of worming paranoia established through the dialogue, amplifying Hotline Miami’s lonely, dreamlike qualities, where nothing is necessarily certain aside from the promise of a gore-splattered spectacle when a stage is complete. To compound this sense of distrust, every mission is based on a lie; a phone message asking you to kill for false reasons. There are a few explorable non-combat spaces and each feels like a tease. You have an apartment with an old video game console on the ground. You pick up pizza boxes and VHS tapes and eventually gain a roommate and you can never interact with any of them in a significant way. They are all background elements. They are initially framed as non-essential. The only way to truly interact with the world is to kill. Such is the case with many games, yet few call out the inanity of it so bluntly.  Before a mission begins you put on a mask. Each confers gameplay bonuses and further obfuscates your identity to place emphasis on what you do, not who you are. The overhead perspective serves a similar dual purpose. It enables you to look across vast stretches of each playable area where enemies wait behind doors and breakable windows to kill you in a fraction of a second. The perspective allows you to plan how to move, from which angle to fire a shotgun or toss a knife or stun an enemy by opening a door behind him just as he passes then proceed to wreck his face against the floor. The perspective also dehumanizes your targets by presenting them as only heads and shoulders and weapons, an effect strengthened by their pixelated appearance. It’s not until they’re dead and their bodies sprawl across the ground in full view with blood pooling about them that they feel human and, maybe for a moment, you feel a twitch of remorse.  Yet whatever regret you may have over brutally and relentlessly murdering is immediately neutered as Hotline Miami flashes a giant score bonus over each fresh corpse. Kill multiple people quickly and you’ll build combos. With enough speed and efficiency and recklessness you’ll amass higher scores and unlock more masks and weapons and receive better ratings at each mission’s end. The gameplay is kind of stealth but mostly quick action. You wait around hallway corners for an enemy to walk away then sprint around the corner with a crowbar, break his head, toss the crowbar at the shotgun-carrying enemy in the room’s corner to score a stun, throat rip the guy who just wandered in then pounce on the still-stunned foe to punctuate the spree with a burst of gore, and in those moments of blood-soaked success feel a rush of satisfaction because it could have gone so horribly wrong. Hotline Miami doesn’t only share the same audio-visual themes of Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive (the director is specifically thanked in the credits), but also the same kind of startling ease of transition between life and death. In general, if you get hit, you die, and if you hit an enemy, they die. The game auto-saves after you change floors of the buildings you assault, but each floor needs to be cleared without making a mistake. Resetting is quick and encouraged, much in the same way as Trials HD or Super Hexagon. Mess up and you can instantly return to the action armed with more knowledge of enemy positions and map layout. Even after you learn everything about a stage, when you respawn enemies may move in a slightly different way and they may not carry the same weapons, so memorization alone won’t result in success. There’s always an element of chaos in the action that parallels the puzzling tendrils of the story. Stringing together a continuous combo throughout a stage often requires frantic improvisation and prevents the action from suffering from too much predictability.  More depth is added through the way Dennaton handles sound. Bats and crowbars are quiet, but guns draw attention. You could run into a room and try to cut everything apart with a shotgun, but in a populated stage it’ll bring in others, some of whom may flatten you before they’re even visible with an unavoidable burst of bullets. To get around this you can target an enemy before entering a room, you can silently fling your weapon to temporarily knock him out, which may give you enough time to punch a patrolling enemy, steal his weapon and murder them both without alerting anyone else. Getting better at effectively juggling these variables, managing sound and line of sight and speed, is a rapid, noticeable process, and the sense of reward for efficiently cutting down all lethal threats is significant because there’s room to slay with custom style. As the body count rises, the sense of disconnection with the tragedy of what’s happening onscreen grows. You crave more kills to again feel that rush of just barely surviving and seeing those big, flashy numbers burst across the screen with Peggle-like splendor. You begin to think more and more like the serial killer you’re playing and find delight in the purity of the task, not the implications. Yet for all the ways Hotline Miami seems to needlessly pop skulls and spray blood, it does so for a reason.  It’s hinted throughout the early non-combat scenes that bookend missions that at first seem so disposable. Violence begins to infect what initially seems to be a wearying, comically dull routine where you run errands following a successful killing spree. Even as the world around you is corrupted by the grotesque and shop owners carry on disturbingly reasonable conversations with corpses bleeding at their feet, you don’t react. You proceed as usual, mission to mission, a process suggestive of a far deeper and troubling psychosis, again thickening the layers of dishonesty in Hotline Miami’s presentation and strengthening its motivating sense of intrigue. Direct and implied lies are piled up until fantasy and reality are inextricably bound, and Dennaton finds ingenious ways of integrating interactivity and story development to keep you directly involved in the process. While the characters rattle the bars of their virtual prisons, driven to discover some kind of truth under the apparent pointlessness of their missions, Hotline Miami’s hyperactive pacing never slackens as it continually offers the same solutions to all the existential issues raised: keep killing, keep playing.",

At first glance, I figured Hotline Miami would be an okay little top-down distraction at a cheap price tag; I was quickly proven wrong. The gameplay is fast-paced and if for any reason it isn't, then you are doing it wrong. It is one of those games where you repeatedly start a level and die in the same way over and over until your mind is numb... and it is awesome! What really makes this game is the soundtrack; a lot of my time was spent anticipating the next level to see if it came along with a new and awesome sounding '80s electronica tune. The story's presentation isn't anything amazing; it is actually somewhat repetitive - get a call, go kill some guys, go to a shop, go home and repeat. This isn't represenative of the plot though! The plot is a bit of a vague cluster-f**k and will likely have you on a wiki page trying to decrypt exactly what in the hell was going on.

Each map presents the player with a bright and engaging enviromental canvas to paint with the nigh neon color of criminal blood. This game is as brutal as it is bright, nearly every thing can kill you as easily as you can kill it. The array of masks can add to slow your near constant death cycle out increase challenge adding a layer of depth to the normally straight forward combat.  Speaking of, combat as mentioned above is fairly simple to grasp Kill or Be Killed. While most weapons are obvious: Guns and Pipes, sometimes you might find something surprising to lodge into the skull of the men unlucky enough to round a corner you're behind. Though I would be doing a misservice if I didn't mention that sometimes you die needlessly due to an excess of windows or an enemy, who had only been knocked down during a frenzied spray of bullets, bury his pipe in the back of your head. One other complaint being that on occasion the 'predictable' enemies seemed to either be too dumb for their own good or suddenly gain the reaction time of Spider-man, though this sort of thing didn't happen enough to become more then a momentary annoyance   The story may not appeal to every one, it is rather then but provides all the motivation one needs to sprint about in a fury to get that one last kill for a combo. However, the story has its moments where it is a flawlass descent in to a bloody hysteria.   I chose this game to recommend for the interesting story, tight gameplay, but most of all because of its grim and brutal combat contrasted with a world alight with neon.",

I'm not exactly sure what's going on in the game or what the story is about because it's a complete mind-fudge, but it's entertaining to say the least.

First off, I want to say that this games' atmosphere and soundtrack are un-believable. Absolutely ridiculous. The game is based around the 80s in Miami, at the height of the neon scene, and thumping club hits accompany you as you mow down waves of white-suited Russian mobsters. This game is incredibly addicting, particularly because one mistake, one single slip-up, and you die and have to start the level all over again. At least for me, this spurred me to persevere until I emerged victorious from the blood-soaked halls of a Mafiya apartment. Also, the story is quite interesting, particularly when the game begins to question the players' notions about that is real and what isn't. On the whole, I had no idea what awaited me when I shelled out the 15$ for this game its' soundtrack, and I am still enthralled by this game's disco soundtrack juxtaposed with the unending violence that occurs on Miami's dark streets.

You play as a nameless murderer who wears animal masks and recieves calls on his message machine telling him what buildings to clear out.  Much like the Hitman games, you are scored and given a title for how you go about clearing each level. However, in almost exact opposition to Hitman, your score and title get better the more wreckless, gruesome, variated, and quickly your kills are performed; fear not though, instantainious respawn keeps the frustraition of dying A LOT attempting this playstyle at bay. You can still play through however you feel, but playing Silent Assassin style will cause your score to suffer. Each mask you unlock can be worn to recieve different abilities or starting items that can make the level easier or harder to play through.  The keyboard and mouse controls, while good enough to 100% the game, can be very frustraiting when things start to happen very quickly. This is because you use the mouse to aim around the room, and at high resolutions, that mouse pointer moves just a little too slow. It is because of this that I recommend using a controller as using two sticks to move and aim just makes the experience more enjoyable and less frustraiting.  The soundtrack is so good that I've added it to my setlist. The game has won two awards for its sound and audio, along with several more for its overall gameplay and design.  I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes senseless violence, and games as artwork.",

The mechanics are very innovative, and the game is beautiful to control. If your computer is even halfway decent, you can run this game fine, thanks to its stylish 8-bit graphics. The soundtrack is awesome, and really makes the game feel frantic, and there is a palpable sense of danger, thudding along with the resonant bass. Your character wears animal masks, that reminds me of games like Manhunt ( Piggsy ), and movies like You're Next. All in all, this game is innovative, jammin, and wonderfully bloody, all for the low of 9.99 $. Buy now, or you will be 'treated' next.",

Ultra-violence, trippy atmosphere and story, and just fast paced combat keep you on your toes for what seems to be one hell of a playthrough. Unfortunately, the game can be short depending on how well adapted you are to the game, but the beauty is that it all depends on your playstyle as you can die in one hit. A really good addition, and crucial element are the masks, with each containing different abilities; Don Juan (lethal door opening), Graham (faster movement), and my favorite Carl (starts you off with a drill). Finally, one of my more favorite aspects of the game is the music, provided by the same composer as to 'Lone Survivor', another indie title. From trippy to tense, it seems fitting for a style so bold.. yet so satisfying to listen to.  Overall, a great, easy to learn game, thats just as fun as it is to die. It'll have you keeling over in a bloody mess every step you take, and the atmosphere is usually tense. Damn... its never been so much fun drilling into someone's skull, especially in a grasshopper mask.  -John Nguyen",

Heaps of praise have been given to Hotline Miami and in my opinion it is justified. This is a bizarre, violent acid trip of a game with some of the most strangely satisfying combat I've played in any game. Fast twitch reflexes with equal amounts of luck will either get you through the level or pressing 'R for Restart' once again. Yes, you will get acquainted very well with the 'R' button because you will die and die A LOT. But I never really got frustrated. The gameplay is so fast and furious that you just....accept it and try out a different plan. Ahh, the plan. There are numerous ways to try and get through each floor thanks to the variety of weapons and effects from the different masks you can try on. Some good (Peter the Unicorn), some bad (Nigel the Bat). This is the best, most addicting game I've played this year. I played through the whole thing twice just to get all of the puzzle pieces so I could see the alternate ending. Don't let the ugly graphics fool you. They are perfect for this game. Oh, and let me give a shout out to the soundtrack. Normally I could not care less about the music in a game. Not this time. This is the best soundtrack I've heard in a game by a mile.

But that assumption would be incorrect with its favourable reviews from the gaming community as proof. And playing through the game, one would find it hard to argue that the game hasn't earned its success.  Its 1980's Miami, with a truly retro feel to match, yet things from it could be applied to the future. The AI, despite not being the most intelligent to appear on a computer screen (the predictablility of your enemies is one of your only advantages in this game), is surprisingly unforgiving and will make sure that you pay for any mishaps or slips along the way through. Thats a trait games of the modern day seem to undermine. Challenge is a necessary element for a game that pits you in situations that don't favor you. The game would lose some of its appeal to me if I didn't find myself swearing and smashing my fist on my desk from time to time.   The combat and visuals are unique to the game. As mentioned previously, the game has a very retro look to it and this has been added to a combat system which is brutal and vivid. I think what makes this game exceptional is that like a lot of games it meets the blood lust of the modern day gamer but has a plot that at the very same time questions your excessive violent actions.   With its style, intelligences, and unlockables, Hotline Miami gets a solid 8/10 only falling short on minor details like the slightly tiresome stealth section in the hospital and errors her and there.

If you don't like hard games then you might want to steer clear, but even as a very difficult game there is plenty to enjoy. The difficulty can be both punishing and forgiving, as you die in one hit, but thankfully the game only restarts you back to the start of the area. The gameplay is fast-paced and suspenseful, keeping you on your toes for the whole game as you attempt to take out all the bad guys in one area without taking a hit. The game forces you to implement some strategy and stealth into the action, making an excellently balanced blend of fun which is surprisingly addictive as you try over and over again to pass the area.  The setting and story also help the game immensely. The Miami setting gives the game a great colour palette to work with, and makes the top-down world look vibrant and safe, a contrast to the actual gameplay. And the story....it's confusing, but done so well as to make you guess what is going on, and allows you to speculate on several things, like the guy who appears in every store you go to after each level, and acts oblivious to the fact. But you know there's something to him.  All in all, Hotline Miami is well worth the $10 pricetag, and you should definitely get it when it's on sale, even if you aren't interested.",

The playstyle in which the player completes these puzzles is something unique to the fact that players must blend mobility, attention to detail, and quick reflexes to survive. The story is driven by text-based classic dialog sequences that gives an interesting look into the game's protagonist while offering up some dark laughs on the side.   Hotline Miami's asking price is more than fair considering the amount of content the purchaser receives. There are several progressively challenging chapters, a slew of unlockable passive skills and weapons that augment player choice. The chapters in Hotline Miami also offer interesting randomization to flesh out replayability further.  Aesthetically, Devolver Games presents Hotline Miami with an 8-bit engine. In the realm of audio however, Hotline Miami is supplemented with an up-beat and fitting electronic soundtrack that would attract more than just gamers, but fans of electronic music as well.  Overall, Hotline Miami hits several addictive marks that will keep the player entertained for hours. The gameplay is generally simplistic, but requires skill and strategy beyond what the gamer may first realize. The randomness presented in levels and forced key-bindings of the controls may present some initial frustrations until the player becomes familiar however. Hotline also possesses some occasional oddities such as: Weapons flying out of reach and some wonky slowdown. These oddities never reared any issues that detracted from the overall package for myself personally. In summary: Hotline Miami is a brave and unique product that will provide several hours of quality entertainment while offering a unique player experience.",

You'll rapidly find yourself in a trance replaying missions dozens of times over (never a tire thanks to the instant reset), slowly working towards achieveing the perfect killing spree. Combine that with an open-ended storyline that never steps too far out of bounds (pretentious indie games should take note), vibrantly gruesome pixel art, and a thumping electronic soundtrack and you got yourself a near-perfect indie hit!   All that's left for Dennaton Games is to iron out the bugs that occasionally pester an otherwise outstanding game.",

I've always loved great plots in games, but a lot of the time the game play isn't good enough to pull me through it. In Hotline Miami, The plot is confusing, in a good way. It makes you think hard and find the hidden things to piece it all together. The game play, which in my opinion is the most important part, also is phenomenal. Its a fast paced top down shooter were you only have to hit once to kill but get killed by one hit yourself, making it really based on reflexes. It may be a shooter you will still be using melee weapons a whole lot, possibly even more then the fire arms. Each weapon, while killing in one hit, works different. Some are long and slow, others short and fast. The guns vary from assault rifle and sub machine guns to shotguns and revolvers. To spice up the game play even more, you get a large amount of masks to unlock throughout the missions. Each one will give you different changes, some make all guns have silencers, Others will start you off with a knife, or give insta kill fists. One turns out all lights and gives you night vision making stealth a whole lot easier. Each mask gives you a different play style making replay value huge. The visuals aren't bad either. everything is done in a gorgeous pixel style. There are effects to make the whole thing look like a 80's film. The soundtrack is probably the best I've ever heard in a game, it blends with the game play to give a truly awesome experience.

It is a great fast paced action game with a fitting theme.  The gameplay revolves simply by smashing enemies into oblivion with the help of a wide variety of weapons and if you are aiming for a high score then maybe adding a bit of a tactical element.  The enemy behaviour is random at some points but I had no problem choosing a pattern and sticking to it until it works, therefore I rarely changed my strat once I made it. For the duration of my playing sessions I died countless times over and over again and if it was any other game I would've hated it by the time I was done with it, but this was not the case here.

You will probably die and restart hundreds of times, then almost clear a floor and die from a bullet shot from off-screen....gets very frustrating. You end up having to memorize a level and shoot things you cannot possibly see, in some places. Some people will consider this cheap and bad design, others will call it a necessary part of the mechanics.   I paid about $1.50 for this, and really that is all I can say it is worth, but I recommend it at that price point. Yes I got 7 hours out of it, but most of that was replaying the same damn thing over and over, the vast majority of that time.  DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE STORY. From the clips I have seen, the sequel actually has some interesting narrative in it, you could completely skip this one and buy the sequel without missing any story. This game gives you about 4 lines of text between every level, and it is all meant to be 'cryptic' but ends up being completely meaningless and useless for solving any mystery yourself. You end up knowing about 10% of what the character you are playing as supposedly knows. The game play is: Killing. That’s it. Don't expect any story. It would be nice to say 'you are left with more questions than answers', but no, you are not even left with any questions or answers.  SPOILERS  You play as a couple different guys who get phone calls and then go out to kill people, there are only a few hints at there being a conspiracy behind this. That is all. You could come up with just about any explanation for the events in the game, including it was all a dream, multiple personalities, Russian mafia, a phone company. Who knows? This may actually just have been an introduction for HM2, as the writers could take the story literally anywhere after this. You are never told anything about any of the characers, at all...none of the 'story' in game actually tells the player anything.  Also, the levels are small so replayability is limited. There are more masks that you can unlock that give you special abilities, than the number of times you will be able to stand replaying a level. Not that the mechanics themselves are bad, but for the simplicity of the levels (and the fact that some 'levels' are pretty much in-game cutscenes where you kill unarmed ppl or just do nothing), I would have expected a lot more levels.  I will have to wait until HM2 is under $3...based on this one, I would be very disappointed to have paid full price.",

            "review_text": "As I've blown through my indie lineup of games, I've often found my own hand reaching toward my back in a patting motion. It isn't only because I've done a good job getting them at bargain price, but because I've been blown away by the constant-surprisingly good quality of them. Now I don't know who to thank, but I've been surprised again by the latest of these: Hotline Miami. Hotline Miami is a top-down adrenaline shooter with an ultaviolence fetish. The player controls the unnamed protagonist as he executes a variety of mercenary missions that remind me of Boondock Saints in their level of crazy one-sidedness. There are dozens of enemies with guns and baseball bats and only one of you. Have at it!  The difficulty is steep but that is alleviated by the predictability of the enemies and the slight penalty for death. It's seriously quick, and you're gonna need it, because you die a lot. But the second you die, an instant reset is available at the press of a button. This 'get-right-back-into-the-action' mechanic gives the player the incentive to try crazy schemes and really helps keep the fast-paced flow. The result is the perfect run, where the player executes a one-man massacre, a symphony of slaughter that leaves me with the warm, fuzzy feeling of overcoming the odds.  Now for what surprised me: Hotline Miami delivers fun mechanics, but it didn't stop there. Also included in this game are some incredibly graphic pixel-art, an extremely catchy soundtrack, and a mind-bending story centering on the themes of ultraviolence, dehumanization, and unnecessary brutality, and it makes for an excellent break between the act-first-think-later gameplay. Hotline Miami didn't have to be the horrifyingly provocative downward spiral that it was, but it was, and I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy every bit of it.",

They manage to create some incredibly gruesome scenarios with pretty basic graphics. The game isn't just bloody, it is vicious. For example, you get extra points if you knock a guy down and beat his head in with a pipe than if you just shoot him. If that kind of thing bothers you at all, I'd pass over this game.  The story isn't anything special. I won't ruin it, but if you like stories that make sense or are really fleshed out, you might be disappointed, like I was.  The game is not poorly made at all. It is fast paced and fluid. It forces you to learn how to succeed without holding your hand. You will die over and over again, and respawn almost instantly at the start of the area.  Some people really like the music, but it didn't really appeal to me. It wasn't bad, it just didn't stand out to me.   A lot of people like this game, but it does seem to be overhyped.

I originally tried this game through less than legitimate methods and love it so much i bought it. It's a great game to drop in and waste 30 minutes on trying to beat your old high score, like good old arcade times.   The story is really my kind too. Apart from my love of the 80's style, the antihero style lead is one that appeals to me. The game also reminds me a bit of Max Payne 3 even though they are very different in gameplay. The lifestyle of the lead character, the drug like effects and a kickass soundtrack are things they have, so if you liked MP3 you will probably find this at least interesting.   The main reason i'd say bought it though is for the sick soundtrack. The soundtrack is atleast 1/3rd of my workout mix and almost all the songs are in my top 50 most listened to on my phone. Some of the songs are in the trailers if you want to hear for yourself.",

Or one shotgun blast. Your preference. 4) Even though dogs like to fetch things, throwing your empty weapon at them does effectively nothing to them.  5) Shooting a door rigged to explode is a very bad idea. When you're right next to it anyway. 6) Even though you're promised all the cool weapons in the game, just get used to the disappointment of not getting to use them. 7) If the police ever suspect you, just raid the nearest station.

Once you are spotted there is little time to react before getting blown into a puddled mess. There are a variety of enemies that will keep you on your toes and well placed bosses to keep the gameplay from going stale. Hotline Miami has perks in the form of masks that give you different abilities. These masks do well to put the odds in your favor without giving you an easy ride through each stage. Weapons are plentiful, although if you get too careless you can find yourself wielding an empty ranged weapon or unequipped altogether.  Although Hotline Miami is difficult, it isn't unforgiving. The story can take about 8 hours to complete. There are many challenges within this game to keep you coming back for more. Your rating of each stage can be improved and there is a massive list of masks and weapons to unlock. Limited replay value is not an issue for this indie juggernaut.  Hotline Miami is a great gaming experience. The game is well polished and very impressive for an indie title. If you do not own this title then be sure to pick it up. It is a great game to buy at any price point.   Hotline Miami gets a well deserved 5 out of 5!",

He is given killing jobs, for example, 'taking out the trash' or 'exterminating the vermin'. As the story progresses, the character grows more insane, takes revenge upon loved ones and has the lust for getting answers.

Though the story may be vague, it is capable of pulling you in to the alternate 80s universe of a hotline hit man.  With one of the best Soundtracks that I've ever heard, hotline Miami is guaranteed to please any gamer who is looking for an indie game worth buying.  ",

In a sort of way, this game is like an extremely, EXTREMELY fast-paced Metal Gear... with only base stages and no fluff in between... and said bases being extremely short but extremely dangerous with a huge emphasis on fast action and actually drawing your enemies to you and getting high kill combos, instead of true stealth gameplay. And you die in one hit from everything, though so (generally) do the enemies, so it's... well, yeah, really fast. And you'll be respawning a LOT.  The graphics are a strangely appealing mix of pixels and a kind of hazy ambience. The soundtrack is fantastic and perfectly fits the game. The level of violence I honestly thought would deter me, but like Binding of Isaac before it, once you actually PLAY the game and understand WHY it's that violent it becomes tolerable, and even viscerally entertaining. The story is extremely interesting and totally ♥♥♥♥ed up. The gameplay... is very fun at its core, but with various crash-inducing bugs (and others that force you to restart the game to fix them anyway), and some small luck-based elements that can be a complete drag when you're trying to ace a stage with a high score, it gets far from perfect marks.  A solid 7/10 game overall, I'd say.",

It asks the initial easy question of 'do you like to hurt people?' and you think its aimed at jacket, the character you are playing, but the more you think about it, it was aimed at you because jacket is given no real backstory as to why he started killing. If you think about it you arent given much in the way of positive renforcement aside from your score and more things to kill with, masks, and weapons. The story gets even more confusing when going into Hotline Miami 2, and even more so when you realise this entire plot is looped in with PAYDAY 2.

I started playing it. I played it for quite a while and I was extremely interested in the game's story. From the beginning to the end, the game gave clues on what was happening. I felt sad for people that died who were the main character's friend. At the last level, where questions are answered, the answers really made me think about the whole game from start to finish, and how everything I was instructed to do was connected to the ending.  Another great part about Hotline Miami is it gives you so many different tactics to complete levels that I couldn't stop trying to find new ways of beating a level and trying to find the little secrets in each level. I tried to find every mask, and I tried out every mask I had, to figure out how they could be used to beat a level.  The music was also quite good and made the story even more interesting.  Although the story and gameplay is great, I found that I sometimes quickly gave up on playing this game because I couldn't finish a level. After about ten failed tries on a single level, I start attempting to speedrun the level because of my anger. This is most likely just because I am not exactly good at games. Even though I sometimes left the game in anger, I soon started the game up, to play more.  I definetely recommend this game to everyone. I shall also be buying Hotline Miami 2, hoping that it will as good or better than this game.",

The story is well written and keeps you wondering what the hell is going on. Although those things are great the gameplay itself is lacking. At times the controls feel stiff and clunky and the AI (If you could call it that) feels random. Sometimes you could be shooting a shotgun right next to an enemy and they wouldn't even notice you. Other times you could perform a finishing move and every enemy would suddenly be alerted. This makes for very frustrating and repetative gameplay. It is not fun when you have to play the same level fifty times, at some point it becomes mind numbing. After the shock of seeing so much blood and seeing cool finishing moves wears off the game gets boring and repetative. I could only recommend this game if you love the art style. In conclusion: You will get all that this game has to offer within the first three levels. 6/10",

You begin recieving odd phonecalls, perfectly aligned in code, you are threatened and forced to commit. I won't say too much more, as it will dangerously ruin the game whether you've beat the game or not. The Developers made it as confusing as possible, so the player could determine the story as well through their own eyes. All in all, I don't think I have ever played such a perfect game in a while, and I mean that. This game gripped me tightly, pulling me through alot of stress in real life, it is entirely another universe and allows you to become 'Jacket'. If you don't have this game yet, please, I do encourage you to get it.  If the game itself isn't enough reason, the hard-working and supporting developers should be a reason for you to at least give it a shot. They've handed out free steam keys to those who couldn't afford the game, and even patched the pirated version of the game so people could play it.   Sincerely, Waffie.",

I say this due to the fact that you will die...a lot. You go in, if you get killed, you restart and try again. So it helps to plan out on how to clear the level. Killing -- aggressively and violently -- is the name of the game here. You as the player can murder with a number of weapons, ranging from the traditional (pistols, machine guns) to the improvised (a pan full of boiling water). Points are rewarded and multiplied by stringing together assassinations and mixing up weapons. Soundtrack fits and is great to listen to while taking down enemies.

The campaign is short, but it's as long as it needs to be for this sort of game. 5 hours for me, but of course I died a lot. The plot is weird too, revolving around the main character's steadily deteriorating mental state. It's something vaguely to with your character killling off the Russian mafia in 1980's Miami, but we have nobody's word for it on who exactly he's killing or why. One scene suggests the character is on drugs and this is contributing to his mental decline. The ending is a slightly unsatisfying conclusion to this intrigue, but the game is so fast paced it doesn't register as that much of a problem with me.  Again, this is quibbling.

You play as a person known by nothing other than 'Jacket', who is haunted by phonecalls that tell him he has appointments for dinner, or that his dry cleaning is done and is ready to be picked up at (insert adress here).  It is up to you to find the source of the phonecalls, but to do that you must kill everything in your way. No exceptions.",

At least the levels are fairly small, so the game doesn't get too tedious. There are a couple of boss fights along the way too, but both of these are pretty terrible.  As long as you enjoy violent arcade action games, there's nothing really wrong with Hotline Miami. On the other hand it's certainly not the masterpiece that some people make it out to be.  The good: - Good level of challenge - Decent controls - Nice retro soundtrack - Surprisingly good (and very twisted) story  The bad: - Level background art is rather ugly - Poorly designed boss fights - Deadzone for the guns is annoying",

            "review_text": "Holy sh**. I did NOT see this coming!  I had certainly heard all about the little indie hit game Hotline Miami and its recent sequel, but from the advertising and the way it was addressed in many videos I watched made me think that it was just a simple top-down kill em' up.  But, boy, was I wrong this time!  Yes, Hotline Miami is all about getting whatever weapons you can to maim, slaughter, and basically kill everyone around you in the fastest way possible. It's designed for you to be quick on your feet, adapt to situations spontaneously, and plan out your actions thoroughly and the control scheme is perfect for this style of gameplay. Hotline Miami is an honestly addicting game. Even if the story sucked, I'd recommend this solely for the fantastic gameplay.  But what about the story? In most videos I'd see on Hotline Miami, I didn't see any that really talked in depth about the story, but it's what really makes this game stand out from the other murder-centric games out in the market today.  See, Hotline Miami has you play as a nameless faceless hitman hired by a mysterious person on the phone to go out and kill as many people in various buildings as you can, and you do that... but the game never lets you settle too comfortably after you successfully spray your enemy's blood across the halls. After you complete a chapter, the music shifts to this strange, dull, and lifeless music and you're left to walk back to your car and take a good long look at every person you had killed on the way.  On top of this, there are several scenes where you encounter three men in a horse, chicken, and owl mask that confront you (and I personally think they are speaking directly towards the player in these scenes) making sure you understand that you are murdering dozens and dozens of people for no reason whatsoever.   As the game goes on, things get more... surreal. People start disappearing in the life of the protagonist, dead bodies start talking to him, and his best friends ends up disappearing suspiciously. The game does a marvelous job at making you confused, isolated, and taken out of the game experience everytime you finish a level. It recognizes that you're playing a game for the satisfaction of murdering people and it knows that it's fun, but it also knows that you should feel guilty for what you're doing.  In some ways, Hotline Miami is comparable to Spec Ops: The Line, one of my favorite games which I just had the pleasure of replaying a couple weeks ago. However, I feel like Spec Ops is the superior game in guilt-tripping you by making you feel ashamed for all the murdering you've done, because it incorporates the story around the gameplay. While you're playing, you'll see the story develops seemlessly in front of you and your consequences will be slowly but surely revealed. In Hotline Miami, it feels like the scenes of gameplay and the scenes for story are separate, save for some levels later in the game.  And that's just me trying to find some sh** to throw at Hotline Miami. This is a great game I've been looking for, but was surprised to find it here. It's got wonderful visuals reminiscent of Vice City, a fantastic 8-bit soundtrack, addicting gameplay, and a gut-punching story. I couldn't be happier with Hotline Miami. If you haven't tried this indie marvel of a game, go check it out! I'm giving it a 9/10.",

            "review_text": "Ah Hotline Miami, the kingpin in the revival of the cheesy 80's. Synthwave, Kung Fury and many more pieces of media have been piling up nowadays trying to appeal to this lost era of hair spray, neon colors and more computerized music than a disco club. Not everything that has come out of this new genre has been solid, but one of the flagship games in it is Hotline Miami.  The year is 1989 in a mirror universe like WarGame where the Cold War kept getting hotter. Set in Miami, you play as Jacket, a mute war veteran who has joined the secretive 50 Blessings organization and is tasked to begin violent murder sprees on members of the Russian mob. As time goes on, the world begins to lose it's base and soon you're debating if what you're seeing is real. Not exactly a story for the ages, but Hotline Miami intends for it's story to be like that of Drive, it's there but pushed to the side to allow the action.  And yes, the action in Hotline Miami is it's selling point. The best way to put it would be 'Arcade' like. In that it's really tight and always trying to screw you in some benign way. Jacket comes with a list of masks he can wear that give abilities ranging from insta-kill punches, drills and nail-guns or having certain enemies not attack you. Guns are useful, but loud and eat up ammo quickly, while melee weapons are fast, brutal and efficent. Balance these two and you'll breeze through levels.  And the soundtrack. Good gracious god the soundtrack. Artists like El Huervo, MOON, Perturbator and more fill this soundtrack with more synthwave good ness than an episode of Miami Vice. Some tones put you on edge, others serve as the grease that aides your really angry glide through a tougher level, and some are nice and somber for htose moments where you don't care about where or who you are, but all you want to do is think.  Hotline Miami is one of the best indie action games out there, with a special feel to it that not many games can match. The controls are tight, the levels are progressively harder, the music is fantastic and the story is subtle when it needs to and in your face when it must. I'd highly reccomend you buy Hotline Miami, and the soundtrack to boot. It's an 80's rush that not many games have been able to replicate.",

It entirely pulls you into the scenery, making you apart of the atmosphere as you play this sociopathic war-veteran. You begin recieving odd phonecalls, perfectly aligned in code, you are threatened and forced to commit. I won't say too much more, as it will dangerously ruin the game whether you've beat the game or not. The Developers made it as confusing as possible, so the player could determine the story as well through their own eyes. All in all, I don't think I have ever played such a perfect game in a while, and I mean that. This game gripped me tightly, pulling me through alot of stress in real life, it is entirely another universe and allows you to become 'Jacket'. If you don't have this game yet, please, I do encourage you to get it.  If the game itself isn't enough reason, the hard-working and supporting developers should be a reason for you to at least give it a shot. They've handed out free steam keys to those who couldn't afford the game, and even patched the pirated version of the game so people could play it.   Sincerely, Waffie.",

You will get killed unless you have the aim of a marine sharpshooter and the reflexes of a cheetah. It reminds me of a top down version of Not.A.Hero, even though that game came later. Same premise, you go to different floors of a building and cause a bloodbath in every house. Various masks give you various abilities and unlocks as you progress.   Second: the graphics. Beautiful 1980's style setting with trippy drug-like visions. This is what Vice City would be like if it was on the Game Boy, except it looks a lot better, and probably would play a lot better as well.   Third: the music. I usually don't like 80's music, but the various styles of music on this game is fantastic. Chillwave is one of my favorite genres and some of the songs on this game features some of that.  Overall, I recommend this game if you are looking for a decent challenge. It is not difficult on the degree of Dark Souls but it can be hard if you have a difficult time with reacting in a fast way. As I said before, you will get killed numerous times, especially if you do not incorporate some stealth.",

The length is alright, but the point of this game is probably speedrunning yourself to death. There are highscores based on how you handle the level, and on the time it took you. Nough said...  The cons are mostly the frustration of the 'sometime' improvising AI. Bots have a pattern, but at times they may ignore it and give you a weird time. I advise to not play this game a whole day because it can drive you mad.  Besides the audio is great, the pixel art is great, and the brutal feedbacks are great. Add the replayability, a good controller or m/k (cuz the game needs precision!!) and you're good to go with Hotline Miami.",

One of my top ten games ever, I cannot recommend it enough (as long as you can stomach the gore and violence, don't worry it's 16-bit-ish).  Although this game is sort of old news now (the sequel has been out for a while), if you haven't played it, get it now. And I suggest you stick to the classic way of playing it, on PC, keyboard and mouse. It has since its original release been ported to nearly every console that can support it but play it on PC. If you use a controller you do not have the freedom of moving the cursor everywhere unless you hold a certain button. If you use mouse you'll have the freedom and precision you'll need and of course you'll have a view of the room if you hold shift.  I'll confess I know very little idea as to what the story is. You play a guy who's always wearing a high school jacket and an animal mask (different masks give you various powerups). You go around the levels and just kill anyone in your way. It is intentionally done in a classic style, one that brings to mind the days of going to the local Blockbuster and bringing pizza home to have a family dinner + movie night. The asthetic and gameplay are just mint.  Even better is the soundtrack. This game introduced me to what is now my favorite music genre, synthwave. If you are unfamiliar, synthwave is basically 80's styled music. There are different subgenres such as pop synthwave, dark synthwave and even vaporwave is a branch of synthwave. I used to have the soundtrack of this game on my phone and I listened to it all the time, commuting to and from work. I have since upgraded my music stereo to a cassette player.  The gameplay, the nostalgia, the graphics, the music, the sheer mindless fun of playing a videogame is all here. I cannot recommend Hotline Miami enough.

So, when the game was on sale, I picked it up and instantly started playing it.  And I fell in love with it.  Well, not at first. The game actually frustrated me early on, especially when the guns were brought into play.  Let's get the semantics out of the way first. Hotline Miami is a top-down twin-stick shooter. The core of the game is composed of entering a building and killing EVERYONE. Or failing to kill everyone, not reacting fast enough, and either getting picked off by gunfire or killed by a baseball bat to the face. To complete your murderous rampage, you have a wide selection of weapons to choose from, ranging from knives and pipes to shotguns and assault rifles. My personal favorite thing is beating everyone to death with a frying pan (to Supertramp's 'Goodbye Stranger'). Don't judge me.  The levels are well designed, lending themselves to planning routes and seeing enemy patrol patterns to find that one opening that leads to victory. However, some of the levels can go on a bit too long, and there are some that I wish were longer. The story, though has next to no replay value (unless you want to replay certain levels, which I do), so that can also be a turn off.  Also (**SPOILERS AHEAD**) one mission really makes me uncomfortable, that being 'Trauma.' I don't feel comfortable controlling a person ho has BRAIN DAMAGE. Not only that, you are also tasked immediately after you return home with the mission 'Assault,' which has you shooting up A POLICE STATION. Not exactly making video games look good here.  But for the missions I have issues with, there are those that I absolutely love. Honorable mention to 'Deadline,' which has you go postal in an office building full of armed goons, but my favorite mission is easily 'Neighbors,' where you ascend the multiple stories of an apartment building, methodically (or sloppily, it's your choice) wasting tons of mooks. Every time I return to this game, I play this mission a few times, just to see how quickly I can run through it. And I haven't even mentioned the artstyle, which looks as if someone took a NES title and infused it with ALL OF THE DRUGS (this takes place in 1989 Miami, so it kinda fits).  So, yeah, I can safely say that this is getting a recommendation. I believe it was the 512th time I died to a wayward dog that this game truly found its way into my heart. This was an experience I will never forget. No other game I have played has come close to this in terms of the 'pick-up-and-play' factor.",

It is very challenging aswell. AMAZING SOUNDTRACK. I couldn't see a reason for people not to buy this game. (Unless we include blood gore and madness). Honestly I love this game and I cant wait to play the next one as soon as I finish. BUY IT NOW. If you see this soon as it goes up do the $5 bundle and buy the soundtrack its pretty cheap.

There are somethings I do enjoy about the game.  1. The soundtrack is really good. 2. I enjoy the story (Well the most I got to until I got to a part which is near f*cking impossible for me to beat) 3. I enjoy the masks system. 4. Fantastic graphics and use of colors/colours. 5. The animations for the enemies and yourself are very refined and awesome. 6. (Not really part of the game) But if you own Payday 2, you get some fantastic items including the main protagonist's mask and a breifcase.

The satisfaction of finishing a level is probably the same as winning Tic-Tac-Toe against a 3 year old.  The 'aiming mechanism' is mediocre, so you constantly use the the auto-aim function anyways, which still is not very satisfactory.
