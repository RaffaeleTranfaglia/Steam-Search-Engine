You might have a hard time finding matches, but that was just me.   Anyways, this is definatly worth a purchase. Have fun!",

            "review_text": "Too bad no one is playing this game anymore and that the community is dying, I really like its concept, and I think the developer needs to get more recognition for this. Lots of customization options, lots. And the game is really fun, especially in a full match; might not be everyone's cup of tea though, and clearly not mine but this didn't prevent me from having fun running around, jumping, boosting, trying to get a shot in. In short, point, dodge, shoot and hope(...) it hits...or know it hits depending on your skill level. In shorter, super fun. Clear lack of a tutorial, but very easy to get the hang of.  [+] : Specifications, Customization, Fun [-] : Dying Community [Note] : Only deathmatch have people on anymore.  Perfect game for an 'on-the-go' gaming (a stable connection is highly recommended) who can't put CS:GO or Team Fortress-type games on their laptop (due to lack of storage?), though this isn't a clone of that at all. Plus it's low specs, low space.  P.S. I already knew that the game community was nearly dead when I bought this, I just thought this game deserved to be known, and it looks like what sells get marked as a success and what doesn't is labelled as a failure, which is really sad as this is really fun. It's sad to note that the 'failure' of this game is entirely based on people having other (maybe better - according to them, at least) things to play...",
