When I first see a new puzzle it seems quite simple, but it requires in fact some time to solve it. In order to advance/unlock a level you require to get a fixated amount of coins, once you do, the door opens and you can move forward. I enjoy three-match games and this one, while not too challenging nor too easy, gives me a good time whenever I play it.",
