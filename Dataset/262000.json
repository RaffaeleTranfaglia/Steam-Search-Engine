            "review_text": "Ahhh.....Gabriel Knight. One of my favorite games of the 90s and definitely one of Sierra's best games.   Gabriel Knight is a novelist and owner of St. George's Rare Books in New Orleans. He's in the middle of writing a new book about the recent string of Voodoo related murders. The writer, Jane Jensen of Sierra fame, did a particularly good job of representing the city of New Orleans and it's vibrant history, and the story itself still holds up well after 20+ years.  It was a little disappointing that they couldn't get Tim Curry to reprise his role as the voice of Gabriel, but I'm sure he was a little too expensive for Pinkerton Road to even consider, let alone the likes of Mark Hamill and Michael Dorn. The actor they got to voice Gabriel in the remake did a commendable job and kept the original style of southern charmer and womanizer, and a few chuckles can be found by using the hand and eye icons on most of the female characters in the game.   While the 3D rendering of the remake brings new life to the game(and it is beautiful), it's a little disappointing to an old school gamer like myself. See, back in the day, adventure games were much more complex and unforgiving. The high resolution textures take the challenge away of having to find a tiny object in the sea of 256 color pixelation of the original.   The puzzles are challenging and require that you pay attention to the information you're gathering from extensive conversations with the various characters in the game. You can't just fumble through this one. if you try, you'll likely be backktracking often or finding yourself using a walkthrough (anyone else remember old Sierra hint books?) to use a walkthrough in later parts of the game. Fortunately for me, I played through this game several times and actually remembered much of what was required to have the game move forward.   If you want to see where the great adventure games of today got their inspiration from, buy this game and support Jane Jensen's new operation. Then maybe one day the Sierra of old shall return. Nah...scratch that. Just stay small and independent and avoid those buyouts so you can continue to breath new life into the genre.  Now Steam just needs to release Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within, but not a remake. It's perfect just the way it is.",

            "review_text": "I was afraid something like this would happen when playing a 20th anniversary edition... Gabriel Knight: Sins of the fathers was the first adventure from Gabriel (the Shadowhunter) in 1993 and the first game created by Jane Jensen. At the time it was a fantastic game, it was one of the first games to include a dark subject, not exactly suited for kids, not because of the violence or blood (that was something that other games always had) but also because of the dark, dramatic, almost ghotic nature of the main story and characters. Something different at the time (and still to this day) was the research that jane did for these games, mixing historical facts, real places, with of course a good dose of fiction to create her own story, and not just an historical retelling. It was always fun (and amazing) to go looking for these places after finishing the game, and see how much of the real world was put into the story. For me the most amazing story of all that jane had created was the one for Gabriel Knight: the Beast within, the second game, about the legend of king Ludwig II and Richard Wagner.  This game, Sins of the fathers, was the first story of the series, and has all the great elements that were expanded in the later adventures of Gabriel. The 20th anniversary edition keeps this story , but at the same time tries to update the game engine, the graphics, sound and even some gameplay elements to make it more accesible to the current generation of gamers...  This is one review where i'm having a difficult time with the steam system for reviews...you can't always either recommend or don't recommend a game...there are gray areas...and to recommend a game is not the same as liking a game...  In this case, for Gabriel Knight, i will say that i like the game, meaning, i like the original game back when i played it 20 years ago and what it meant to me and to players at the time it camed out... That same game (the story) is still here in this 20th anniversary ed, and i'm glad i have a version compatible with current systems and accesible online (installing the old CD version is a pain...)  But...aside from that, to be honest this new version is... while it looks better than the original that camed out in 1993 (of course!)...the one from 1993 was more polished and had greater graphics and sound (for that time) and this version from 2014 actually has worst graphics (for a 2014 game). So the problem here is that, what the creators of the game tried to do was (i think) do a new version with updates that make it more appealing to 'current generation' of gamers but at the same time not changing too much and keep enough things to still make it appealing to the 'old generation' of gamers that played the game in 1993...and the result is one game that it's not really appealing to either one of them...   The graphics for this version are updated of course, they are better than 1993, but they are pretty bad for a 2014 game, and even though they are noticeable improved from the previous game of the company (Moebius) they still have several problems: the animation itself is low quality, badly animated and there are bugs like the spinning head problem (where a character in game starts spinning the head like a possesed doll) and it happens all the time, also the characters appears and dissappear when closing a door or leaving a room..the backgrounds for the game are nice...and just that, but they are far from scary or moody or anything, they simply are sterile.... The characters closeup portraits are fare better in comparison, but honestly the 2014 Gabriel version... (the most important character) seems more like a teens pop star than a shadow hunter. His hair still has that 1990s volume that was so common back in the day... but now by today standards it just seems wrong (and funny!)... that's precisely one of the things that has to be changed in 2014 if you want your character to be taken seriously... the dialogues....and the voice actors...the dialogues are too much for a 2014 game....meaning too much lines of everything...yeah...for me it was interesting to have all (or most) of the original dialogues...as a collection curiosity...but for 2014 is overkill, (even if the important dialogues are being colored in yellow) the world has changed, people has shorter attention span, and also the way stories are presented today has changed...it's not worst, it's just different, you can still put a big story like the one from Gabriel Knight in 2014, you just have to make some changes to make the thing work...it's not about caring or not caring for the original game, it is about making something that has better flow of narrative, (and again, you are trying to make a new game that will appeal to current gamers)   About the new voice casting, they are doing a fine job at that...but it's not at the level of the original cast of 1993 with Tim curry, Mark Hamill and Leah Remini. Of course it would be impossible to get the original actors for different reasons (too expensive!) and also the low quality recordings (as for using the original material) so it's no surprise there but that's one thing you have to consider if trying to redo the original game...  The only 'updated' element that i think is actually better on this version, is the music, wich is done almost all over again by the original composer/producer of the game, Robert Holmes, and it is great, even if it just sticks to the original themes, it does show and advantage over the old version and it sounds great.  So my review for Gabriel Knight is that,  i like the game , because of the original one that i played in the 90s, the story is still there,  but i don't recommend the game  because i don't see this being interesting in 2014.   The problem is if you are going to do a new version of an old game...you have to make it attractive for 2014... and make all the necessary changes...yeah...the fans are gonna be mad...well, this is not for the fans, a new version is for the new players. As it is, this version is only appealing to the original players of the series, like myself, but no so much to current generation. If you are doing it for the original players of the game only, then just make minimal changes, update only the things that can be updated without changing the core of the original, the things that make the game be what it is (like the Another World 20th anniversary ed wich is nice) and be clear that you are making a product that its more an historical piece of gaming than a 'new game' wich it isn't.  I know by now many people that love the game must hate me, but i will say that, there's no point in redoing and old game from another era if there's no possibility of doing it right... The translation from 1993 to 2014 in this case, and for different technical/artistic reasons had many elements lost in the process (or changed for worst), and i very much prefer to see a new game by jane jensen and a new story than a 20th anniversary edition....

I'm pleased that the story lost nothing over the years, and is just as unique and spellbinding as I remember it.  This edition maintains all the wit and creativity of the original, with updated character graphics and location scenes to introduce it to a modern audience. I was delighted to find that all of the things I loved about the original were retained here, including an absolutely gorgeous soundtrack.  If you're a fan of the genre, and especially if you were a fan of the old Sierra adventure games, this is a must-have (along with its first sequel, which although stylistically different has a story even more engrossing than this one).  10/10 would stroll down memory lane again",

            "review_text": "Jane Jensen's classic point-and-click adventure game, Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father, is back in a special, 20th Anniversary Edition update.   Developed by Jane Jensen's own Pinkerton Road Studio and published by Phoenix Online Studio, it tells the tale of writer and rare book store owner Gabriel Knight as he discovers that the sins of the past can come back to haunt you.  The original title, first published by Sierra Entertainment, holds a special place in my heart. This was the very first PC game I ever had, actually bought 2 months before we actually had a PC. I still remember seeing the box art, that hanging figure and being strangely drawn to it. It was also one of the hardest games I ever tried to run on our first PC. Figuring out that I needed to create a boot disk and what that disk needed to contain was as hard a puzzle as any I had to solve in the game! And considering this was before the Internet gave us all the answers, still a proud moment for me. Most of my DOS/Command Line skills were learned trying to run this game, skills that I still use to this day. And if ever I actually write a horror story, this game will have had it's hand in this as well.  The 20th Anniversary Edition comes with glossy modern graphics, new voice acting and the story we all loved 20 years ago. It also comes with the same point-and-click gameplay it originally had. Whereas some would qualify it as classic, others would call this style of gameplay archaic. The action is slow with you clicking on something and waiting for the animation to bring the character there before doing whatever you were asking. Puzzles, which make up the bulk of the challenges, are a mixed bag. Though you'll find many to work intuitively, some are obtuse, and a few are horribly frustrating. Luckily, a new hint system was imbedded in the menu structure to give a helping hand when you need it without having to resort to the net (or a certain guide...). Unfortunately, the worst offenders require trial and error and a good bit of luck to solve, even if you know the answer. These bog down the game and will lead some to never finish the title. Which would be quite a shame. On a plus side, they modernized the interface. Though we lost the nice, atmospheric icons of the original, changing it from having them all grouped up at the top of the screen to a direct contextual ring upon selection is definitely a move that needed to be made.  As I stated, the graphics were changed. Gone is the pixel art of the original. In it's stead we have new 3D High Res graphics to play with. Overall, the new graphics are rather pretty and well made, with generally smooth animation in the movements and interactions. However, I do miss the original and wish a “classic” mode had been included (though I'm not sure if they could have done this legally). Your millage may vary but players used to modern day graphics should appreciate the update. Each locale you visit is interesting, distinct and memorable and the art team did a great job of updating these. New Orleans really comes to life, from the French quarter to the bayou. Note that I did notice a few, very minor, graphical issues in my play-through. The game also features a few cutscenes. These, part graphic novel and part animation, are truly stunning works to behold.   One update that I'm very happy with is the music. Re-orchestrated and re-mastered by the original composer, Robert Holmes, it is one of the highlights of this experience. I liked the music back when it was played through a not-Sound Blaster, so you can imagine how much I love the updated tracks. Luckily, I per-ordered the game and received the original sound track as a bonus. Each location you visit has a distinct musical track associated with it, giving as much to the games atmosphere as the visuals. It's so that you could almost play the game with you're eyes closed. I wish more games today would go the extra mile and bring the aural part of their games on par with the visuals like this one.   On the other side of the spectrum, the voice acting is something I have trouble with. Now, this isn't to question the change in cast members. The game originally featured such talent as Tim Curry, Mark Hamil and Michael Dorn. With a low budget and 20 year old recordings, they had to get some new actors. For the most part, I felt the players were fine. Unfortunately, the two main voices you'll hear in the game, Gabriel and the narrator, are points of contention. I originally played the game on floppy disks, so I had no voice acting. So all I had was my imagination as to what our protagonist sounded like. What you hear in game is about a thousand leagues away from that. I don't feel it fits the character all that well but I did get used to it. Of course, upon looking up what the original sounded like, I can't say I Tim Curry was any closer to my imagination either. The narrator is another situation as well. They kept the same idea as the original, a New Orleans accented lady to add to the atmosphere. But yeah, no, I can't say it was that great of an idea on either case. At times, the narrator sounds tired or bored and the rest of the time the accent just gets grating, especially when you can't find the solution to a puzzle. Of course, you can always mute the narrator if you'd like. Still, as stated, the rest of the voice acting was fine.   For me, the highest of the high points in this game is the story and characters. The story is fully enjoyable, blending elements of magic and occultism from the old world and the new in a fashion that's still pretty unique. The things you do and the places you visit and why all form a very interesting arc between good and evil, past and present, and love and duty. The main characters are likewise well developed and realized, showing more than one trope or dimension. I played through this more than once when I was young and still enjoyed the story and characters this time around.   Ultimately, this version of the game suffers from the same problems and issues that it has always suffered from. And I'm not sure how authentic it would have been if they had been removed. I can say that if you're a fan of old school point-and-click adventure games and their unique sense of logic, or if you were a fan of the original but can't play it anymore cause one of the disk died on you (still sad about it), you should check this out. But this isn't the adventure that's going to change your mind if you don't like this kind of game.",

But apart from Gabriel himself, all of the voices sound very familiar to the original. Even the narrator has the same 'elderly woman' sound, commenting the players actions with a great blend of irony and partial impassiveness.

Being an adventure game fan, I've heard good things about it, and I was stoked.  Let me start off by saying that the theme is really interesting, a welcomed change of pace. It's rare to find games that feature voodoo, cajun, or New Orleans culture in a respectful manner.  I think in the 90s, Gabriel Knight was hailed as a cutting-edge franchise because it was a modern noir murder mystery story set in New Orleans, featuring POC characters, and it was quite violent for a video game at the time - a point &amp; click, no less.  With that chunk of history in mind, and the 17+ hours I've spent playing the game, it's safe to say that it is pretty good!  But, I do have a bone or two to pick, and I'll explain why in detail.  To be honest, it was really difficult for me to really connect with Gabriel and appreciate him as a character; but, over time, I grew to appreciate the game and other characters, instead, and then it became much more enjoyable.  I feel that the characters, music, and atmosphere is what really made the game for me and it was what kept me from uninstalling the game because I was so frustrated with Gabriel being little more than a womanizing dream boat - who falls in love with a woman after only knowing her for three days!  (And she explicitly told him she was uninterested, at first)  Story-wise, I felt that Gabriel was a flop, in the beginning at least, and I thought the love-at-first-sight and playing hard to get aspects were uncomfortable and unnatural (but it was a popular theme in 90's story-telling, I'll admit).  Also, Gabriel had very little character development up until the peak of the plot, which was disappointing because it made him seem even more of a pretty boy cut-out instead of the formidable hero he was - literally - destined to be.   But, my personal gripe aside, it was a good adventure game; I had fun with the puzzles and I enjoyed interacting with the characters, too! (Mosely and Grace were wonderful, I just wish that they were a bit more involved.)  This was a good remake, and I hope that the other two games will be redone so that they may have a chance to reconnect with old fans, and inspire new fans, as well.  ",

What starts as a surprisingly high quality, but ordinary, mystery adventure game, turns into a true jewel during its second half. A major issue I had with it, though, is the sexism displayed by its main character. The game designer and main writer is a woman (Jane Jensen). Perhaps one ought to assume that Gabriel Knight's character is written as a criticism to the stereotypical male game protagonist.",

This remake has been developed with care by its original creator, Jane Jensen, and the quality of the final game is superb. The entire game has been recreated in 3D and ported to the Unity engine, but the final look remains exactly the same of the original game, it has been ported very carefully, and none of the original details have been missed.  I strongly recomend you buying this game!",

It's enjoyable whether one did or did not play the original (I would imagine much more for the latter category).  Pros  - Better graphics. You do not have to stare at pixels anymore to experience one of the best stories in PC adventure gaming history.  - A pretty faithful rendition of the original puzzles. Not much 'remaking' done.  - Some of the cutscenes beat the original even.  - Voice acting is surprisingly ok all things considered.  - Some interface improvements (like ability to highlight all the hotspots).   Cons  - Occasional graphics bugs and animation blunders. Not nearly as bad as in Cognition though.  - A couple of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzles added that were not in the original game. Minor issue.   - Some people (like Kotaku reviewers) might find the game lacks atmosphere somewhat. Though I do agree with the statement, it wasn't game breaking for me pesonally. ",
