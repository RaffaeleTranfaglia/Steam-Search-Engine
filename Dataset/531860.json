    "description": "Whereâ€™s My What is a simple yet highly addictive game where you must identify and select a certain number of items on the screen before time runs out! While it sounds simple, it quickly becomes a dash against the clock as you pinpoint the right items in dozens of included categories.",

            "review_text": "First of all, I got this game for free from somebody giving out a free mystery key.  Although I don't find myself an avid fan of hidden object games, I figured I would try this game out rather than just letting it run for cards. After a bit of gameplay, I have a number of complaints.  First of all, the classifications are awful. What are 'Faster Things'? It appears the only things under that category are vehicles, so why not just say that? 'Sharp Objects'. Alright, I'll click this sharpened pencil over here. Wrong. According to this game, Cars and Boats smaller than the size of a cat are also not 'Toys', which doesn't make a particular lot of sense.  Another issue I have is how repetitive levels get. Every round, you get the exact scene with the objective 'Find [previous round's amount of objects + 1] in X seconds.' I can see it difficult for a Hidden Object game to keep itself interesting, but absolutely nothing changes between rounds aside from a few more objects on the screen.  Speaking of objects on the screen, you have to scroll throughout the level to find them. This terrible in itself, but each round adds more objects meaning a longer scroll time. I would rather just look at one single frame with objects shruken down to an appropriate size.  Ultimately, this game isn't worth its base price. Even if it went on sale for 90% off, you could still find cheaper games for trading card farming or even buy a better hidden object game.",
