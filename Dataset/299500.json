            "review_text": "Got a key a little while ago from a bundle i bought over a year ago. I thought i would give it a go as i used to quite like snooker.  Glad i did as it's a very fun and polished little game. It is very easy to pick up and play for someone like me that knows the rules of snooker and have played it a bit but am also a pretty rubbish player:)  There are lots of tournaments to enter and credits to be won. You can then spend them on upgrades, different cues, auto-chalk and the like. The AI is pretty good, doesn't cheat and does make mistakes. Obviously it gets better the further you get in a tourny but the difficutly is nicely curved.  The graphics are good as are the sound effects. A special mention goes to the crowd. They ohh and ahhh when you miss and pot a difficult shot you'll be met with a cheer. You'll even hear them cry 'go on my son' and cough. And too much noise will be met with a shhh from the ref.   If you like snooker even a bit you will enjoy this game. It's addictive and fun. I recommend picking it up on sale at least. Oh and it has pool too.",

            "review_text": "After reading some of the reviews for this title, some of them seem a little unfair.  If you are after a nice little game of snooker and don't care if it has fancy graphics or well known players - its great.   I agree it is a little easy, it's quite simple to make breaks that IRL would be almost impossible. But if you enjoy snooker as a spectator this is a great game.  Although it lacks the humour and feel of old time (Archer Maclean) classics like Jimmy White and Pool, it's still a solid representation of the game of snooker.  Personally, I don't feel that the physics are wrong, the cushions and pockets feel (to me) like they should and are a close approximation of a real 'fast' table.  I like that you can drop in and out of tournaments and that you can speed up the play of AI opponents.  I'm not that fond of the woman they got to do the voice overs inbetween frames, but it serves a purpose I suppose.  All in all it's an excellent and very playable snooker game and I'm glad I purchased it.",

            "review_text": "If you are after a snooker game then this a good game with a fair price and great graphics. But there a few things to note. First off you are probably going to want to leave the aiming guides turned on. This isn't cheating, it just compensates for the lack of depth perception that is inherent in virtual pool games, at least until there is a version that uses the oculus. If you stick to playing in first person it gives a fairly realistic feel and balance to the game. If you turn them off then you end up playing nearly every shot from the overhead camera view which makes if feel like an 8-bit arcade game. Also lining up the shots in the overhead view without the guides is so frustrating that you'll find yourself moving your head to strange angles and spending a few minutes on every shot to try and find the right line, only to miss by an inch or two anyway. Changing to the overhead view at all could be considered cheating but it is the only way to get a overview of the layout since you can't walk around the table while playing, something that I found lacking. There are also shots where the pool cue completely obstructs the view while in first person, which is odd since a little tranparency would have been an easy fix here. Changing to the overhead view is a must in this case.  To play you set the desired spin, cue angle and power level before clicking on a button to fire the shot. A mouse driven cue and power action is sorely missed here. Coupled with the guides it takes nearly all of the interactive feel of the game away. However, since spin, power and cue ball placement are so important in the game of snooker it still has its merits as a tactical game or training aid.   As mentioned in other reviews, the AI is inconsitent because they will play poorly for half a game and then trot out a break of 50 or more at the end. I also feel guilty when snookering the opponent since in many cases they will miss, at least in the early stages of a tournament, and it is so easy to force them to replay the shot and win the frame by default after the third miss. They simply don't change the shot they attempted the first time.  I'd recommend the game to anyone with a passion for snooker but I'd be raving about the game if these points were addressed. As it stands I'll just have to repeat that it is a good game with a fair price and great graphics.",

Bad:  - Dead multiplayer. - Unpolished UI. - Broken store. - Predictable.  For 20 rubles it's as good as it gets I guess, pity though the devs could of made some money if they finished this game specially with snooker games being so rare.",

I've also won too frames from the lower AI being incapable of getting out of the most simply of snookers that 'it' itself got itself into and won 2 frames as a result of the 3 miss rule.  Aside from that for a fiver (or £2.50 as I paid) it's fine but certainly no more.",

            "review_text": "I purchased this for $1.39. It's fun, but not without it's flaws. I had to forfeit a match after scratching on a shot where the cue ball would not return to the table, so the game could proceed. In this game if you have not played it, you earn credits to upgrade your cue, get different couloured chalk, etc. I spent my credits on the auto-chalk feature, where the computer is supposed to chalk your cue before each shot. I started failing on a lot of shots, and attributed the problem to not manually chalking my cue, even though | had this feature.  The ability to fine tune your shot would be enhanced if you could use a key stroke to fine tune the angle, rather than just adjusting the mouse. Sometimes it's two or three minutes to get where you want to position the cue.  Lastly, this is an individual game, I am vain enough that | don't want anyone messing with my statistics. It would have been nice if they could have added a feature where you could create other players, for friends to try the game. You cannot lower the amount of frames played if you play 8 or 9 ball, every time you tap the button the frame count goes up.  It's fun, but I am glad I only paid $1.39. If they update to improve some of these features I would recommend the game, as it is, your statistics do not really reflect your statistics with these flaws.",

I found that it is quite simple to pick up and play, granted it did take a good second to learn the controls. Spending a little over 2 hours playing it in my first go around, understanding that this has been given mixed reviews after having played it. The only issues I had was with the fine tuning in the game; it jumped around and 25% of the time never really went in the direction I wanted it to go. And the power meter can be an issue in high tension moments of the game. All in all it's a good game to sit down and play for a moment as a small escape from a hectic day! Pool without all those pesky quarters!",
