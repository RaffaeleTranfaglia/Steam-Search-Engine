            "review_text": "Postal Redux is an isometric, twin-stick shooter, and is an amazing remake of the original Postal. This version was remade from the ground up and is even using a new engine. The new artwork and graphics look great and are well made. The contols feel great when using a keyboard &amp; Mouse. The music, sound effects, and voice acting is excellent. The original Postal Dude's voice is back again and sounds great. The weapons feel well balanced and gives you a large combination of ways to handle any situation.  Just like the original the main game is short at about 2 hours on a full clear of all levels. Don't let that detour you from the game because the new Rampage Mode extends the games life. In Rampage Mode you have to clear the map and try to rack up a high score. You will get a number of weapons to use and many ways to complete a full clear of the map. Enemies are more challening in Rampage Mode adding a level of challenge and fun to the game. It has been stated by the devs that more free content is on the way. Special Delivery and Multiplayer is planned and will be released once it's ready.  If you are a fan of Postal and Postal 2 what are you waiting for just buy it, and have a ball, because this game is well worth it. Hatred players come on and give this game a try too. For anyone that loves twin-stick shooters give it go as well, because this game is perfect for you. For anyone else that may be new to the Postal series just give it a go and see if you like it.",

Some updated graphics make the game easier on the eyes. that and a few tweaks to the interface make it easier to tell what's going on, and make the game easier to play overall.   Players new to the series might find it difficult to get into, as it's still a top-down shooter from nearly twenty years ago. Even so, this is a classic that I would suggest to anyone.   Maybe now we can get a Postal 3 not made by Russians?",

I wish there were a bit more story to the game, I heard ther is a background to it involving the air force and the delusions of the Postal Dude, but nothing about that is described in the game itself.",

Gameplay-wise not a whole lot has changed. Rather than pressing the “next level” button you now run to the exit area for a stage after killing the requisite number of baddies. Controls are also improved significantly for gamepad and the overall “flow” of the game feels much smoother than the original. There are a few new weapons but I found the shotgun, missile, and flame weapons to be pretty much all you need to complete the game on nightmare difficulty.  The graphical overhaul has made for a much more enjoyable experience and little details like being able to tell different kinds of police and soldiers apart as well as what weapons they’re holding is a nice touch. Animations for all characters are also very fluid, contributing much to the improved flow mentioned earlier. The soundtrack that accompanies all of this is likewise also improved and things sound better than before.  The original Postal was a decent game with a few flaws here and there. Redux manages to pave over those flaws and present itself almost as if it were its own unique game. In fact it’s so much better and comprehensive than the original that you might as well just play this one instead, especially since the story is more or less the same. ",

The situation has changed recently, and I must say I'm satisfied, though I didn't really have any expectations.  It's different.  It's simple. You could say that there's no plot (none that matters, anyway) and not much humour, just  killing  and  pure madness.  Still, playing it has been genuine fun. There are great many ways of completing a single level, depending on which weapon you choose, how you use covers and explosives (both stationary and hand-carried), whether you are killing civilians (intentionally), etc. You should give this game a try even if you've already played the original version, what with the new engine and small things. The loading screens, however, are truly ANNOYING! They actually give you enough time to make yourself a cup of tea each time you're dead and have to start a level again.",

            "review_text": "Now after beating the game I will give out my review.  Postal Redux is a remastering of the original postal game with updated graphics and controls. One thing I will mention is that the controls are much better than they were in the original postal. (Seriously they were ♥♥♥♥ in the original)   Pros+ -Much better controls (even better shooting than the recent game Hatred) -Decent variety of weapons -We got good ol Rick Hunter reprising his role as the Postal Dude. (we even have Corey Burton who did the dude in Postal III narrating the ending.) -Really messed up and awesome looking illustrations. (my Favorite is the one in the credits and in the main menu) -a good handful of levels with more coming in a free update  Mixed opinions+/- -while the shooting is very spot on it also means the enemies can't really miss shooting you unless they're throwing grenades, shooting rockets, or firing napalm launchers. It can make it hard not to die. -Ignore this if you have been a fan of the Postal Series since the first Postal...but the tone here is much different than Postal 2. It seems to be focused on a much more gritty and twisted theme than offensive, low brow humor. (although I really don't have a issue with it. I enjoy dark stuff, but it can be a little surprising.) -the graphics aren't the best, but I didn't have a issue with it. I know others might though, but it's freaking Postal so who cares XD.  Cons - -Those god damn rocket turrents! They keep firing rockets non stop when your in their view which means they can keep blasting you and you keep getting knocked down. I can count at least 6 times I died thanks to this, and I know you can duck, but I didn't even have enough time to do that while the Postal Dude was getting up....plus ducking isn't helpful when your forced up against a god damn wall.  -The Air Force Base level. This level was complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me since there were so many god damn swat officers and so many buildings where they come out of. Plus I had times where I forgot a guy south of me had a ♥♥♥♥ing napalm launcher which resulted in a cheap death because you have barely any control over the Dude when he's on fire! The only pro I have for this is that after this you get to the final level....and see a lot of messed up ♥♥♥♥. So at least the payoff was worth it.  -The AI is dumb as rocks. Innocent civilians run around like idiots so it makes it hard to do a pacifist route when the civilians are too dumb to run away from the dude than running in circles.  -There are no subtitles.... I know there's not that much talking in Postal, but it's almost impossible to hear Corey Burton in the Ending due to the other sounds being much louder than him.  Verdict:  Postal Redux is a very good remastered version of the original Postal video game and for $15 dollars you can't go wrong. So if you wanted to get into the first game or you just want a decent amount of fun shooting pick this up. It's worth the money.",

There is no original POSTAL atmosphere anymore - now the game sounds are very boring, characters models are crooked and not combined with the environment aesthetically. If Hatred used UE4 opportunities, using this engine in POSTAL Redux is not justified - for the game with drawn backgrounds it's just an extra load on the system. And so on, and so on.  But why I decided to buy this game if I didn't like it? Something has always been interesting to me - how interesting to play the first POSTAL game in the cooperative mode? But I'll never know it. When I try to launch the game I actually waited for 10 minutes to load of main menu. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ING TEN MINUTES! When it's over, I tried to run some level. I had to wait for a long time, but loading doesn't complete. It's ironically, but the pirate product, that I played before, don't have any simular problems, and works much more stable.   So, what's the conclusion? I'm better pass the original POSTAL game again, than try to play this misunderstanding. That's all.",
