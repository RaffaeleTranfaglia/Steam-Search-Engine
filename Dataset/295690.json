The Black Ops 3 campaign is way longer than what we are used to in this franchise. I think it took me about 12 hours, which is a good length for a shooter, even by normal standards - but especially compared to other Call of Duty games.  The story was pretty boring in the beginning. But it got better and better, to the point where I was honestly interested in how it all would play out. The acting was pretty good (real actors, digitalized). And the ending - well, the ending was great. It left me sitting in front of my monitor and wondering what the hell just happened. I ended up reading explanations and theories about the story for another 20 minutes. It is a surprisingly complex story for this kind of action game. Not quite on the same level as Bioshock Infinite or To the Moon, but way above your usual CoD story. I have to say, I really liked it (despite the boring start).  The gameplay is CoD standard. Nothing special here. You have some abilities to unlock and upgrade. But I rarely used them. You have a wall-run, but only a few opportunities to use it in the levels. It felt unnecessary. And that was a shame, because it's a cool mechanic and should have been integrated better in the level design. Most of your enemies are the typical noname soldiers. There are also certain types of mechs. Some are soldier-like, and a few bigger ones, which require the use of a rocket launcher. So there is some variety here, but in the end it is typical CoD shooter gameplay. Which is not brilliant, but alright.  The graphics are ok. The game looks quite good sometimes, but overall dated. They really make the most out of the old engine. But the game cannot compete with modern titles like Battlefront or Witcher 3.  If you want a number - I guess I would give it a 7.5/10 for the campaign. And it could have been more, had they improved the gameplay a little more. I really didn't think it would be that good. ",

            "review_text": "Particle Mace is a neat little arcade game with a more modern approach!  I'm not very into arcade or score-attack games, in general, so this is definitely not a game I can get much out of. Regardless, I think it's a pretty good game, getting quite a lot out of such a simple concept.  The gameplay is very simple: it's similar to asteroids, but instead of shooting in front of you, you have a bunch of particles tied to you by 'strings'. These particles kill enemies on contact, so you're trying to swing them around you while avoiding collisions. One hit KO ensures pretty fast rounds, for the most part.  Aside from the more traditional arcade modes, where your objective is to get the highest score, you get Missions mode. In this mode, you get 3 missions to complete at any given time, out of 150. When you beat a mission, you get another, and so on. This is pretty standard, these days. But Particle Mace gets the upper hand by introducing missions with tweaks to the actual game. For some missions, there are no enemies, asteroids and much bigger, maybe the background color hides certain enemies, maybe you need to race for certain points, etc. The changes are quite varied, and they mostly bring something new to an otherwise repetitive experience, focused on score alone.  These missions also unlock ships (and does scoring high on arcade modes). Unfortunately, there few ships, and most of them aren't very usable, in general. Maybe in some specific situations, but I kept using one or two of the ships 80% of the time. Perhaps some more manual customization (with perks) would have worked better. Of course, it would have a different balance, so yeah... The point is just that the ships didn't seem to balance towards one particular direction, but actually be more gimmicky.  So far, so good.  There are 2 problems that I have with it, though. One of them stopped me playing. The other, I think could have extended my investment in the game, but seems to be tailored towards the score-attackers, which is a shame, as it could have appealed to both!  The first is how some of the missions are conflicting with one another. Some are synergistic, but some make others almost impossible. For example, wanting to kill X enemies while having to survive for Y time without particles. You can't kil anything until you beat the latter mission... Some are more subtle, like trying to race through all the points while avoiding killing anything -- they're not mutually exclusive, but close.  This problem is aggravated, somewhat, by this being a physics driven game -- It's more unpredictable, leading to some undesirable situations. Nothing new, I guess. But hey, overall, I thought the game was still pretty cool! Unfortunately, when I was at 137/150 missions, I had a set of two missions that made progress literally impossible.  I had to survive for 60 seconds (60!) without particles. Also, I had Mega Asteroids that filled the screen. The asteroids closed in on me in less than 5 seconds. There was absolutely no path to take. It's certain death. And there's no failsafe for these situations. The only 'solution' is to reset all of my progress. Yeah... no thanks.  As you can imagine, that's rather annoying. Specially with no accounting for it.  This could be solved by, for example, getting some currency for score in Mission Mode, and then using it to 're-roll' a mission into another, for example. It would be back sometime later, but you could postpone an immediate problem like this. Either that, or actually disabling a mission.  Since it's impossible to make progress, I simply quit playing.  The second problem is how the achievements' bar is far, far too high. There are quite a few achievements, but they're *all* for very high scores. You can only start earning some when you've already invested time and effort into it -- sure, that may be the idea of an achievement, which I recognize. On the other hand, achievements can also be a way of keeping people interesting. For me, as I'm not a score-attacker, having some easier achievements to pursue could be good. I'd still be pursuing something, get invested, and then may even by invested enough to go for higher scores.   As is, the achievements are purely for higher level players, I guess. Not too big of a deal.   Anyway, I've written a bit too much about this game. It's neat, and it works well, for the most part. I definitely feel like 10€ is too much, but since the game is on sale for 19 cents, you should definitely buy it, as it is pretty fun and well made!",

When the social anxiety started to kick in, I grabbed another drink and shuffled over to where they had a few indie games set up to project against the walls, thinking that if I looked like I was engrossed in watching others play, no one would bother me. People seemed most excited about a game that looked like some sort of colorful modern Astroids, except they were sling-shotting particles around and fighting with four players in a battle royale. I don't really recall everything that happened that night, but at some point I had a controller in my hands and was playing Particle Mace against three others. It was one of the most intense and fun gaming experiences I've ever had, and I somehow managed to outmanouver everyone and claim victory.  Yes this game is beautiful and silky-smooth fluid, but most of all it's SATISFYING. Every time your particles smash into an astroid, enemy, or player, the game emphasises it in a way that scratches an itch I didn't know I had.  A++ would recommend especially as a (drunk) couch co-op game.",

There is not much to say to describe the mechanics that isn't already conveyed by the video, but I should say that the availability of several ships and game modes ensure that this game isn't as monotonous as some of the classics it is inspired from.  Ah, the “System requirements” section for the Mac on the store page is a bit laconic so I will complete that: this game plays perfectly on a 2006 Mac Pro running OS X 10.7 (Lion) using a GeForce 7300 GT as video card.",

The screen shakes and wobbles around every time you kill an enemy, which makes it extremely frustrating when you score multiple kills at once since you won't be able to see what you are doing and will most likely fly straight into an asteroid and get a game over. Another big flaw is the fact that at least in my case I have to disconnect every non-mouse/keyboard device from my PC in order to play it as the game will recognize anything else as a game controller which renders the game unplayable.  On the positive side; the soundtrack in the game is nice, the graphics are simple but very cool and the gameplay is decent.  I feel like the two very glaring faults I mentioned ruins the game for me, but since it's very cheap and it will at least keep you entertained for a little while I can't really fault it too much. I wouldn't recommend it personally but if you're a fan of arcade games, go for it.",

Pros :  -Intuitive controls -Good music -Original design and gameplay style   Mixed :  -Fun gameplay for the days where you don't know what to play, but somewhat repetitive after some time   Cons :  -The missions are normally unfair, colliding with each other (aka 'kill x enemies in a short period of time' and 'survive with only two pellets for x time', etc...) -30 FPS lock? -Achivement bugs from what I've experienced   Keep in mind I couldn't test the multiplayer. In conclusion, I would get this game when it's on sale (I think it's less than a dollar then?), due to the problems above. I rate it 6/10.",
