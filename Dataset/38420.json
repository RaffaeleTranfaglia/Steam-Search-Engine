You will learn to bend; if not you, will you break. In these dark times, the Brotherhood - your Brotherhood - is all that stands between the rekindled flame of civilization and the howling,...",

            "review_text": "Fallout Tactics emphasizes tactical combat and strategy but limited interactions with non-player characters, but they can still be traded with. Instead of towns, Fallout Tactics centers around Brotherhood bunkers and missions. The bunkers serve as a central point for the Brotherhood, and players can obtain the services of quartermasters, mechanics, personnel yeomen, and medics.  Combat in Fallout Tactics is a bit more complicated than the previous two Fallout games. Unlike those, which featured an individual turn-based system, Fallout Tactics features three combat types: Continuous Turn-Based (everyone can act at the same time, and action points are regenerated at a rate based on Agility), Individual Turn-Based (used in the original games) and Squad Turn-Based (each turn is given to a squad and include the ability to change stance, modifiers for height, and setting sentry modes).  Fallout Tactics is also the first of the Fallout games to feature a multi-player mode.  In this mode, each player controls a squad of characters and faces off against opposing players. During game setup, players are granted a number of points with which to purchase squad members and gear.  Although the main character in the single player game has to be human, recruits from the brotherhood and characters in multiplayer matches can be of any of the six races featured in the game. Humans, Super Mutants, Ghouls, Deathclaws, Dogs or Humanoid Robots.",

I like the games atmosphere the darkis humor, the tactical implementation, its not a fallout 1 or 2 but surly its a good game. It uses an ismetric graphics old and still good loking altogh the max resolution (800x600 and 1024x768) is not much but it still enjoyable.

Plus, it's all in the Fallout world, and meshes well with it.",

            "review_text": "Don't let the low time on record fool you, I've dumped many hours of my life into this game.  I first played this game at the ripe young age of 13, and I hated it for not being Fallout 1 or Fallout 2. It was only after my enlistment, in the United States Marine Corps infantry, that I truly came to fall in love with Fallout Tactics.  Reasons this game is awesome.  Reason number 1 - Voice acting by Gunnery Sergeant R. Lee Ermy. Oo ♥♥♥♥in' rahh gunney!  Reason number 2 - Voice acting by mother ♥♥♥♥ing Gunnery Sergeant R. Lee Ermy. Nothing gets your ♥♥♥♥ harder than Gunney Ermey giving you a mission brief!  Reason number 3 - Setting up a final protective line, FPL, to cut your enemies in half with a Ma Deuce, i.e. a Browning, fully automatic, .50 caliber machine gun, firing at the cyclic rate of 500 widows per minute.... kill bodies, eat babies  Reason number 4 - Build the ground element of a Marine Corps air ground task force, MAGTF, this is your ♥♥♥♥in' war, wage it however you see fit, sir.... EDIT - There will unfortunately not be an air element to your MAGTF, so do a good ♥♥♥♥in' job on the ground.  Reason number 5 - Establish a well oiled, well greased, killing machine of a squad. You need a charismatic squad leader, you, google Fallout Tactics perks for why. (benifiting the squad is better than benefiting yourself) An 0331, Machine Gunner/heavy weapons expert, for supressive fire and severely ♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥ up. An 0351, assaultman, for kicking in doors with a shotgun at the ready. An 0326, Reconaissance Marine, for gathering intel on your enemy. A Navy corpsman, Doc, to patch you up when ♥♥♥♥ goes bad. An 0311, Riflemen, Grunt, Killer, Baby Eater, Life Taker, Murderous, Evil Sum ♥♥♥♥♥, Amphibious ♥♥♥♥in' warrior, ♥♥♥♥ down the neck of a decapitated corpse, god damned life taking man.   SIDE NOTE - The latter description of the 0311 really really applies to any Marine Corps MOS beginning with the numbers '03'.  sorry 0341's, go play cards at some other FOB.... 0352's, your in CAAT platoon, which means your on the .50, so your in. And my brother is an 0352, so I like ya'll.  Reason number 6 - Men run faster than women, because ♥♥♥♥ equality. This is a god damn combat simulation. Strap a 100 lb. ILBE to a woman's back, and another to a man's back, and see who moves ♥♥♥♥in' quicker  Reason number 7 - Orchestrating an ambush feels, and sounds, like Chopin's Nocturne in E Flat Major. It's god damn beautiful when you cut several men/super mutants/robots in half. The cacophony of machine gun fire fuses into a melodic battle hymn, as you see your enemies crumble before you.  Reason number 8 - Enfilade fire, when the long axis of the target coincides with the long axis of the beaten zone. the machine gunners wet dream. Google it, understand it, use it.  Reason number 9 - Voice acting by Gunney Ermey....  Reason number 10 - You get a ♥♥♥♥in' tank....",
