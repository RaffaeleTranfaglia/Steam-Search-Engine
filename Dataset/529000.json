            "review_text": "It's actually a fun little beat'em up in addition to all the obvious eye candy. Mechanically speaking, there are no surprises here. You advance from screen to screen using combos, jump attacks, and special moves to beat your enemies senseless, racking up a score as you work your way to the end of each level to fight the boss. As you progress, you unlock new characters to play in the following levels, keeping the experience fresh with new attack animations to use against new enemy types, as the opposition grows tougher and more numerous. The beat'em up levels are interspersed with some mini-game levels involving guns and car chases, which also get progressively harder. Additionally, there are portals you can occasionally use to take a different route to the end of a level.  The game comes with the normal mode where you control one girl on screen and the difficulty corresponds to that. There's also the more entertaining Xtreme mode where the AI controls the other girls simultaneously as you all beat things up together, although the opposition is a lot stiffer to compensate. There's a training mode, a survival mode, and separate modes for the shooting and car chase mini-games if you particularly enjoy those.  Call me shallow, but simple games like this combining good music and classic gameplay in one daringly sexy retro package are one of life's small pleasures, and this one is well worth the low price of admission.",

            "review_text": "I amending my review because I can no longer give this game a thumbs up. It just doesn't work anymore.  I have been told it is because I have 5 joysticks attached to my PC, but that isn't so, because I don't. It was further explained that this game thinks my keyboard, mouse, remote control, phone etc etc are all joysticks.  It was suggested that I sit down and start uninstalling drivers and unplugging peripherals to try to figure out something about a virtual joystick..... I guess because i have nothing better to do with the limited time I have to play games than spend a frustrating hour plugging and unplugging peripherals and installing and uninstalling drivers and rebooting and all that garbage, but i am not going to do that.  This game cost 10 bucks and I got a total of 48 minutes playtime before it was updated to no longer function.  I hate getting ripped, but I hate it more at Christmastime.  I have had it for too long to get a refund at this point.  ------------   Original review - This is a terrible game, and if not for the eye candy, I would say it was the worst game I've ever played on steam.... The eye candy is there tho, and it's cute and all......... But, make no mistake, the gameplay, mechanics, story and music are awful! Fist of Jesus plays better than this....and that game sucks! lol",
