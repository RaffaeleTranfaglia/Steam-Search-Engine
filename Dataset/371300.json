            "review_text": "Knee Deep is an episodic murder mystery game following three protagonists who come together to solve the murders happening in their hometown of Cypress Knee. The setting is set on a stage and it's really surprising the first time when you see the buildings and environment being built right in front of your very own eyes. You as the player have some control over the three main characters of the play. I say some because I felt as though some of the selections that were given felt forced on me.   Anyways, there are choices you can make (in a form of news reports that you can send to your editor/boss), that will determine how other non-playable actors will react to you. Now, since there’s only one act, I am not sure how much of an impact my decisions will have on future acts so that is to be determined. I will update as more acts are added.  The characters are quirky, albeit strange at times but they all have unique personalities that set them apart from each other. I mean it’s not every day someone asks you to feed a raw chicken wearing a diaper to an alligator. (However, if this is an everyday occurrence to you, please call me.) Some of the dialogues are funny and the story is engaging. I believe it took me about 3.5 hours to complete the first act so it’s not too long.   I would recommend this game, especially since the price dropped to $9.99. The developers are pretty responsive to their players.   I’m not much for scoring but I suppose I would rate the first act a 7/10.  For your viewing pleasure, I uploaded my playthrough of this game on YouTube.     Knee Deep Playlist  ",

            "review_text": "Knee Deep is an interesting mystery adventure game where you essentially play as the director in a stage play called Knee Deep. The play revolves around the death of famous actor, Tag Kern. At first glance, it seems like it would be an open-and-shut suicide case, but three characters soon dig deeper and together uncover a conspiracy involving the entire town of Cypress Knee.  The game immediately strikes you with its unique presentation. The art style is pretty and the way the camera moves as well as the cinematography really makes you feel that it's a stage play. The characters even transition through scenes, which while it could be considered as padding, really cements the idea that you're directing a real stage play instead of just playing a video game.  The characters are endearing, too. I especially liked Romana, the blogger. Of course, you kind of dictate their personality through the choices and how they say certain things, so it's easy for me to make the characters likeable. Some might find some of the characters cliche'd or typical, however.  The mystery of the game is also pretty good and keeps things tense. The pace of the story-telling is great and really makes you want to find out what happens next. There are also some small puzzles that are fun distractions from the pretty heavy tone of the rest of the game.  A small complaint I have, however, is the wonky controller support. At least at the time of this review, the controller only recognizes input when your mouse pointer is near the choice area, which isn't exactly ideal as you're then blocking a portion of the screen. Hopefully this can be patched in a later update.  Overall, I really enjoyed Knee Deep and I would recommend it to fans of adventure games as well as for those looking for a nice mystery.  What I played: The full game in about 5-6 hours Like: The story, the art style, the overall presentation Dislike: Poor controller support. Rating: 4.5 out of 5",

            "review_text": "Knee Deep is an ambitious take on the interactive movie (Telltale 'em up) formula. The twist here is instead of being inside a TV show, you choose your own adventure inside a stage play. This allows for some novel cinematography and very clever, well-paced scene transitions. The mechanics are no different to anything else in the genre, but by embracing the idea of the player being the director rather than an actor, the more tedious walking from point A to B aspects of the genre are removed, which lets you focus on the story.  Unfortunately, although the plot has all the right ingredients - corruption, rednecks, mythology and a down on his luck private ♥♥♥♥ - it never quite comes together. I am not sure if it is the direction of the voice acting or the script itself, but it feels like the characters never really react to one another. The dialog is somehow missing whimsy, given the absurdity of the whole setup. The second and third acts go a bit more in a self-consciously theatrical direction, but it's not enough. That's a bit of a shame, because as mentioned the concept is incredibly strong, and both the set design and the music is excellent. It's definitely worth giving this a playthrough just for the ideas it brings to the table. I look forward to whatever the devs come up with next.",

It´s pretty cheap...  The VR Version is really nice.. It´s like an interactive TV- Show ... Awesome get this now if you are even remotly interested in Adventure Games...",

            "review_text": "Literally just finished the game and with the game fresh in my mind I'd like to introduce my thoughts on the game overall. I definitely enjoy the idea of setting the game as a play and all of the overall 'My kids are with the babysitter till 9 and my wife doesn't much care for me' but that might just be me. Every choice felt like it truly mattered, even if only in a small way. The characters each had their quirks and felt likeable and the story keeps you guessing. An unwelcome intrusion may have been the few supernatural elements that were poorly explained but hopefully a sequel could explain these as the ending is quite open. I feel the ending may at least have explained what the characters questioning by the agents ended with but not every thing can be explained and it might be best if left to interpretation. Overall I'd like to give Knee Deep 8.5/10 for being the most intresting game I've played in a while and I played a some game about Pyramid Headed people and a man named Jake or something? I don't know but I know one thing.   RIP Gators everywhere, I see them in my dreams everynight after they make love to me in a car and die from chillyness...",

            "review_text": "Knee deep is a great, noir, dialogue-adventure game. It contrasts with the different Telltale series because you don't really move your character or collect items. You just choose what the different characters are doing, and what they say in a given moment. You watch the characters and environments morph as though the game takes place on a stage, which is actually pretty novel and entertaining. This game really excelled at walking the line between bizarre and emotionally-engaging. Many adventure games which stray into bizarre territory lose me, such as D4. I was interested in what happened to these characters and this strange town, and the game's relatively short 4-5 hour playtime ensured that it didn't wear out its welcome.",

            "review_text": "I wish I was able to give this game more credit, because when it does things right it's very enjoyable. However, there's enough to hold the game back that I wish there was a neutral thumb. It's not strictly bad, but there are some serious negatives.  The game is a select your own branching narrative styled game that follows a murder mystery taking place in the Florida Swamps. Think Carl Hiaasen like feel if it were a novel. For the first act of the game it seems to follow this pretty well, a strong drama with some action and black humor to keep things varied. But the next two acts seem to lose sense of what the game was about and the final act feels like it is rushing to close up all the loose ends the first two acts used to keep us wanting more.   Positives:  +Technical: The game worked just fine on my computer. No problems to speak of. +Soundtrack: The soundtrack is amazing and easily worth listening to on it's own. It cements the feel and tone of the game. +Time: If you want a quick play, you can easily knock this game out in a few hours. +Sense of Humor: The game isn't afraid to poke fun at itself. +Visual style: The game looks great and has an original feel thanks to the stage like atmosphere.  Negative:  -Dialogue: Ranges from 'okay' to 'please stop talking.' -Storyline: Starts strong, but then it seems like it can't decide if it wants to be funny or not. Rushes into an ending. -Time: If you wanted a longer game, look elsewhere. -Characters: While interesting at times, they vary from stereotype to just nonsense. -replayability: few of the choices truly seem meaningful and there is little incentive to play again after the first time.   Ultimatly the game isn't worth the $19.99 it has right now. Wait for it to go on sale and only if this genre of game is something you really love.",
