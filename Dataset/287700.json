            "review_text": "After gaming for over 20 years, first starting on a SNES controller in the early 90's, I am giving my first gaming review. It is fitting that the first review I write, is the latest of the franchise that I first fell in love with on PS1, the original 'Metal Gear Solid'.  Having played and finished all of the Metal Gear franchise, I can safely assume that I could regard myself as somewhat of a MG seasoned expert and Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF), Hideo Kojima has once again proven that he can easy bring AAA games to the field in a seemingly effortless fashion.  MGSV: The Phantom Pain is a visually pleasing and exciting adventure with a story line that sheds new light on the events of Outer Heaven and Shadow Moses. True to the franchise, stealth is a big part of the game; but not vital. The option to go guns in blazing is there for the times you just get too fed up of failing to infiltrate an enemy base and want to progress.  The combat mechanics of the game are easy to understand and adapt to, even for beginners with varying scales of difficulty. These mechanics are implemented into a very successful multiplayer mode which focuses on both team death match and objective style missions.  Campaign progression introduces multiple new systems of gameplay all the way until the final missions, and although the story is quite linear, there is a extreme level of freedom in regard to choices. Each choice has a consequence, some of which are small and more like an easter egg while others can affect events later in the game. They are not permanent though; all choices can be overturned by replaying particular missions to achieve desired effect.  The map size is incredibly large which can take a substantial amount of time to cross on foot, so there are a variety of vehicles that can be driven across the landscape. The open environment is fantastic for planning and executing missions and the amazing and picturesque graphics feed the desire for those who like to explore. Riding along on horseback, with a rocket launcher in hand shooting at Soviet T-72 tanks whilst listing to a great soundtrack of 80's hits from your Sony walkman is one of the pure gems of this game.  The story, like all Metal Gear games; is the best part of the game. From those that know the background of Naked Snake and his transformation to Big Boss will know the heartfelt detail that was put in to developing individual characters and giving them real human emotion to bring out that of the player. Favourites of the series like Revolver Ocelot and Kaz Miller make a big appearance in the games story along with some new characters like Skull Face and Quiet, which players will come to appreciate.  Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a master piece and deserves the respect that each of the franchise receives. It is an amazing story that will make you think about warfare and human desire for retribution. This game is one of the best for 2015 and should remain at the top for quite some time.  I give MGSV: The Phantom Pain the following ratings;  10/10 Story 10/10 Gameplay 9.5/10 Graphics 9/10 Soundtrack 9/10 Multiplayer  9.5/10 Overall  This game is well suited for those that enjoy the following franchises: Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell, Hitman, Grand Theft Auto, Max Payne, and Mafia.",

            "review_text": "[Contains very subtle spoilers]  My late review. You've heard the hype. You've heard the from the Hideo Kojima lovers (see my MGS:GZ review for my thoughts on him) and you've heard from the Konami haters (I couldn't care less about them either) - Now hear an impartial review from a true casual gamer.  Firstly - I love it and can't recommend it enough, but to give some insight on how it plays.... It's a desert island game. If you were stuck on an island with nothing but a PC and coconuts for eternity, this game would keep you occupied for a fair bit.  In typical MGS style the plot is completely out there, nothing really makes a lot of sense, and you don't really know why you are doing a lot of what you are doing. Without any spoilers, basically after the events of MGS:GZ you are looking for revenge but you end up unearthing a couple of other major plot lines along the way, which are really good - actually better than the main plot IMO. Its certainly entertaining, cut scene rich and more 'war symbolism' than you can shake a nuclear warhead at. The voice acting is great, the characters are interesting, if sometimes a little cringe. I found the ending quite unsatisfying - but the ending isn't 'the end' of playing. I got over it.  There is a constant air of seriousness about the plot but its mixed with plain weirdness and humour. You will have all seen the videos of sheep being fultoned into the air, hiding in a cardboard box with a hot chick on the front of it or using a water pistol to subdue a solider.... well the same game also contains the horrors of child soldiers, bombs stitched into peoples stomachs, Dr's and nurses being murdered by machineguns, patients shot in the head in whilst they sleep inches from you and a virus that has sickening effects on people depending on the language they speak. So yeah - Its got funny and at the same time it hasn't.  The choice given to the player, straight after the prologue, is huge. You embark on a journey of plot, main and side missions, which unlock as you go but you can generally chose which order to complete the few you get at a time (on some occasions you are forced into plot missions) - All this is done through the 'iDroid' which is basically a fictional 80's smartphone with a really crap interface. The iDroid interface is perhaps my -only- real problem with the game as a whole as being a loyal keyboard / mouse user, its the only part of the game you can see is still console-ified. You do end up becoming quite quick on the iDroid though.  In each mission, unless specified you can go all out action or sneaking or a bit of both. I found it plays a bit like a Splinter Cell Conviction in terms of combat and sneaking, enemies try and flank your last known position etc. Same trappings as all these 3rd person cover games you end up cover sticking to walls you don't want to or running over cover when you wanted to go behind. When the game opens up a bit more you can take a buddy on missions with you too - Choose from a dog, a horse, a robot or the half naked woman sniper, each have different pro's and depending on your play style you'll end up taking each one eventually.  The missions replay-ability is very clever. There are conflicting 'challenge tasks' in each mission which means you would have to play them a few times differently to achieve them all. Some reviewers I note don't like this idea of repetition, but I do. As well as this there are online challenges that change every now and then that give you bonuses to your online MGS:TPP profile.  I would argue there are only really 31 plot and main missions. Then there are 'extreme' or variant versions of the same missions over again - How the game deals with this is a tad annoying as it sort of leads the player to believe 'there is more' when in fact you quickly realise 'oh its the same again' - Again I don't really mind re-playing the same mission, especially if its an extreme variant such as Total Stealth but the way its presented to the player is a bit cheeky.  There are a bucketload of side missions to complete - A lot of these repeat the same tasks but given the choice of approach given to the player I forgave this, I had loads of fun completing all the side missions in all different ways.  All the missions are detailed and each has a lot of depth. Things are going on in the missions you don't notice the first time, second time or even the fifth time playing them and the game encourages you to replay the mission to discover these little details. There are situations where you can complete missions earlier because you know where the objective is before you would 'normally know' and there is even dialogue in the game that notes this.  As you play you develop better kit which again leads to replaying old missions with better kit. The development of kit is extensive; there is an immense amount of guns and gear to develop and customise, you must develop your base of operations and buddy kits too.  There is also a 'staff' game mechanic where you collect soldiers for your own personal army. Each staff member have different skills, like support, combat, medical etc. I really like this part of the game but unfortunately its let down by the crappy iDroid interface and it makes moving staff around your base very cumbersome and off putting.  To summerise the single player side; It is an epic journey, with a breadth of 'things' to complete. Not just the missions themselves but the challenges, collecting collectables like tapes, blueprints, animals, scouting out staff, developing your base and gear. You can continue to do this for a very long time too. The single player alone makes the game brilliant enough for me.  Then there is online MGS:TPP, there are two halves to online mode as I see it; There is the 'VS' mode and 'FOB' mode - I didn't think there was 'enough' to the VS multiplayer strain and I think its because as a shooter, MGS:TPP is pretty standard in terms of its shooty mechanics. There isn't anything new or groundbreaking about it, or nothing that makes it unique (other than it being MGS) - Its also a grinding unlock type system which is off putting. After playing a few rounds I realised that I might as well play go play my usual favoured shooter because I'm better at it and its better at doing it.  The FOB mode is the more interesting online mode. FOB is your Forward Operating Base which is just like your single player base but every player who plays MGS:TPP single player eventually gets one - You develop this base too. You can raid other players bases and steal resources and staff from them - How you do this is up to you but the main options seem to be by killing, stealing or infiltrating the base, depending on what you want. You start your raid from an individual platform, for instance infiltrating the medical platform should get you some good medical staff but if you wanted resources you could go to the support platform and steal a load of crates and then just evac out.  If you are discovered on another players FOB base and they're online they can join the base and defend it. This nowadays invariably never happens as the 'rush' of the game has passed and the number of online players is much lower... most bases I've come across the players have moved on and are playing something else, which makes raiding much about the resource stealing. Other players can retaliate later on your base but only if you were discovered on their FOB... if you sneak in undetected you basically get away with it.  There is plenty more I could cover, but I think that gives anyone reading a good view of what the game plays like.",

All these hours I have in the game I truly played and enjoyed.  However...  You can literally pinpoint the moment in development when Kojima ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Konami and exhausted their patience, resulting in them stepping in and pushing this game out of the door.   - Many loose strands, gameplay and story wise. Mysteries and plot points that go nowhere and gameplay features like a battle gear tank that was supposed to be playable but isn't. - Story that trips all over itself, with a completely recycled and practically non-existent second chapter. - Woefully under-used Kiefer Sutherland and no character development for most of the cast of characters.  - Most of the story and character development is buried in a section of your menu for audio logs/cassette tapes. Even major plot points are relegated to audio logs. - A selection of audio logs stand out with much higher production values than the others, with 3D sound and environmental sound design as well as better voice acting, all which point towards initial plans to make them into fully fleged cutscenes.  - Game continues after the credits roll. At this point, motivationally speaking in terms of story and resources, you have no motivation to continue playing. I couldn't bring myself to complete the last few missions (which are for the most part literal repetitions of previous missions but with stricter objectives like no supply drops).   I have no doubt that if Kojima and his team were given another year to realize their vision, this game wouldn't leave such a sour taste. As it stands, all that is left is A Phantom Pain...    Still recommended.",

This is a nice change of pace compared to titles that have been released that were obviously unfinished. That being said the beginning sqquence for me was a bit slow but it opened up into the open world gameplay in Afganistan. This is the point that I am at right now in rescuring a friend and will pick back up on it in the morning.

            "review_text": "I freakin love this game, not since GTA San Andreas have I placed this many hours into a game in such a short amount of time. Very rare to have a game this good. One of the rarest games out there you can marathon till you get sick of it and a few hours later marathon it again and get sick of it...again!  Pros: MUSIC: Brilliant; found a Soviet soldier playing 'kids in america' I lol'd so bad given how serious the mission was.  AMBIENCE: The tense music really makes your heart beat. Get ready to break a sweat when things get tense! SETTINGS: Bit dry at times and kinda boring (it is a desert after all) but otherwise ok, what GTAV's desert shoulda been. MISSIONS: Really immersive. Want an S Rank? Be prepared to play for hours on end. CHARACTERS: Mysterious even after 25 hours in. Can't wait to see characters develop after each mission. STORY: Only 7% complete right now but 25+ hours in? I cannot believe this! HUNTING: You can hunt animals (not eat em unfortunately; only rescue them; you get paid though!). My favourite aspect of Red Dead Redemption was hunting animals; this is about 75% as good. WEAPONS: Good. NVG's awesome.  Cons: SAVING: Really wish it could have save anytime. Checkpoints are annoying at times (but don't turn them off there is no way to save manually; if there is one I've yet to find it). LEVELING UP: Takes a while to get good weapons and then get even better ones. Be prepared to kidnap every soldier and send em to Mother Base (solved later through scope upgrade which allows you to see highly skilled targetable soldiers to kidnap). CUTSCENES: Almost none; I miss them :( what happened Kojima?  GAMEPLAY: Can feel like just cause 2 at times but obviously this is solved when you get into stealth and start sniping/tranqing everyone. HEALTHBAR: No eating to regenerate health and no health bar! This would have been so good given how Boss is spending most of his time in the desert.  Too much to write about. Play the game.  UPDATE: Just want to correct something on CUTSCENES. There are cutscenes in the game for important events. Its not like the game is totally devoid of them. Case in point being (NO spoiler here) the Quiet vs. Boss sniper battle (which I didn't expect to happen so randomly and caught me completely offguard; but man was it fun! Just don't forget to bring your sniper rifle, it was lucky i even had one at the time; my battle was in the daylight so she was extremely hard to spot; she's a one-two shot kill so beware when battling her; took me 40 mins to bring her down as she's constantly moving about and it's impossible to keep a tag on her). As for the STORY I just met Otacon's dad in a rescue mission that took 5 hours - reason being i wanted to kidnap every guard on base including the walking gears; which are also very hard to tranq with a silencer; their detection radius is insane). Also PLEASE do NOT spoil the game for yourself by watching youtube videos on it. It really takes it way from this rare experience. Also don't get on the hype bandwagon. The game has it's flaws; but that doesn't ruin the gameplay experience itself.",

            "review_text": "Story:: Even though at this point i have almost 30 hours total in game, I have still not completed the main story, between missions you will often feel the need or want to do the many side missions the game has to offer so you are better prepared in the next story section. The story so far has been intreguing and you start to see two colliding ideals within the motherbase, through your actions you can decide which side you take for some missions.  Gameplay:: The controls are as smooth as butter on a heated butter knife, very responsive! I was playing with a PS4 controller and it just felt 'right'. The mechanics have changed for the better from Ground Zeroes, Some animation times have improved or been sped up in order to keep the games flow steady and everything flows much better.  The only issues I had were with D-Horse and Running, The horse is very unresponsive at times, often times just stopping completely or getting stuck on rocks, also stopping the horse running is extremely hard and often times sent me flying off a cliff to my death. I now avoid the Horse. Creating motherbase takes time and resources, though it never seems daunting or boring. There are many weapons and items to create and you will have fun trying to get soldiers with high enough stats to create them.  The Buddy system is fun to use, personally I like DD at the moment, he is fast and spots enemies (and prisoners) in your area which is a life saver sometimes. (I haven't unlocked FOB mode so I cannot review ONLINE play)  Audio: The audio is brilliant in this game, The voice acting has never been better for most the characters, Snake feels distant in some of his audio which is a shame considering the actor change, but overall Keifer does a decent job. Some audio tapes found in the field have a unrealistic sound radius sometimes where you can only hear it when very close to it, regardless of it being extremely loud on inspection.  Visuals and performance:: Never have I seen a game so heavily optimised! This is the most optimised game I have ever played which explains the small download size! Don't be fooled, it is not because the game is small, its because the game is constructed beautifully which is why even on lower spec machines it still works and runs beautifully.  The cutscenes are all realtime but most the time it is near impossible to notice due to the games graphics being so crisp, with only a few issues such as the dynamic blood system creating some seams on clothing or on Snakes face, though it is rare and isnt extremely noticable. Flora is beautiful and the world, as vast as it is, looks amazing with minor issues every now and then such as textures not loading in the far far distance which is only noticable if zoomed in on purpose (I am a game design student so I look for these things).   Overall:: The game is worth a buy, even more so if you have played the metal gear solid games before this one, you will get hours and hours out of this game before even getting into the actual story. It looks brilliant, is optimised to the max and will give you a good run for your money.   I was running on a i7 4770k, GTX 780Ti gaming edition, 16 GB RAM and am holding a solid 60 FPS the whole time on the max settings.",

That said, if you played Peace Walker and thought, man, I really wish this had been on a console / PC instead of PSP it would have been great, this game fills that niche (minus the solid narrative of PW).  I could write a lot more, but I'm still kinda dazed from playing the game for 40 hours over the span of two days. I think that sort of says it all for me at least. This game isn't for everyone or whatever everyone expected, but it certainly is for me.  ",

Nvidia GPUs can make use of better AO than what is available in-game through the Nvidia control panel by selecting 'quality' for AO. You can also use MSAA through the control panel, which really makes the game sharp. Those jaggies in the distance are annoying when looking through binoculars trying to spot stuff.  Incredibly well optimized, and probably going down as my favorite game of all time at the rate it's going. The amount of freedom, customization, quality, gameplay mechanics, etc, etc is just top notch. Been playing for 4 hours almost and am at 2% completion lol.  edit: Now at 14 hours almost, and at 6% completion lol. I haven't even unlocked much of the stuff. Still only have D-horse as a buddy and no vehicles. The game is just so fun, even attacking the same bases over and over on different side ops missions, the enemy routes and patrols change. Their locations change, the number of them changes, the way you went in last time might be heavily guarded this time. Motherbase itself is just fun, capturing soldiers and having them join your own private army. I've barely even played the story mode.  Sneaking all the way through, deep inside enemy territory, only to have things go wrong, and have to run out with your objective blasting away, and hiding as enemy soldiers run past to see what happened, man it's just exhilirating!!! Anything and everything could happen at any minute. It's the best stealth action game I've probably ever played. Just look at some of my screen shots to see enemies walking literally a foot away from me, and going unnoticed.  edit: I have a really hard time putting this game down. I was suppose to stop playing 5 hours ago. That has happened every time I play it.",

            "review_text": "no spoilers.  I really love this game, and I think it's probably one of my favorite games of the 2015 year. That being said, it is also pretty flawed, mostly because it just doesn't feel complete. Most likely because it wasn't completed.   A lot of people say there's virtually no story in this game, and I just don't think that's true. Chapter 1 feels like an entire Metal Gear Solid story that's much easier to understand. There is a lot of missions in between that don't exactly make the story flow, but I would really hope you'd like the Metal Gear gameplay in general because this game offers you a lot of it. I actually even told myself and my girlfriend that we should just consider Chapter 1 the end of the game and not expect anything else, cuz we would have been fine and happy with that.   But then, as you keep playing Chapter 2, you get sucked into the story. It seems like more things are going to happen and that things are going to get solved or change a little. Even though I knew it probably wouldn't go anywhere, I still fell into it, and its just a shame. The story builds you up to all sorts of things, but then just is over out of nowhere. Like it was just really very incomplete and very unfullfilling. I almost wonder why they didn't just cut the entire chapter 2 out, but I suppose that would be a decent amount of content wasted. This is a pretty big flaw and I really don't blame anyone for disliking the game because of this, but I find myself able to look past it since I enjoyed the gameplay and Chapter 1 so much.   To add on to the gameplay, the open world is actually really cool. I do realize that everything between guardposts and things like that is kind of dead ground, but it makes the world feel a lot bigger and part of something. My only complaint is it's just not fun to travel around. Most open world games give you a fun way to travel from place to place. Take Saints Row or GTA, you can drive around quickly and run people over or just narrowly avoid traffic while trying to get from mission to mission as quick as you can. In this game, you can't really do that. If you try to drive through an outpost, you'll almost certainly be spotted and lose a tiny bit of heroism for it, which isn't much of a problem. But then, they tell EVERY outpost and guard to be on the lookout for an intruder, so every base is now on alert.   Traveling around just feels like a chore and you aren't rewarded well for doing it. All those complaints aside, I still really appreciate the open world aspect of the game and love that I have a big open Metal Gear world to do whatever weird Metal Gear things I want to do.   I really recommend this game to fans of the series, or at least people who love the gameplay of it. The second chapter story is clearly not finished and I don't think it will be, but chapter 1 is great. There's only maybe 3 bosses in the game too, which is a bit of a flaw depending on how you feel about Metal Gear bosses. I'd say it's worth full price, but it'll for sure be going on sale to 40 bucks and below more often and on different sites, so maybe look out for that.   Very very fun game, but also very flawed. Tons of content, but at the same time, it's unfinished.",

I have been playing this all day since it downloaded (with breaks for food and stuff of course). I'm playing this alongside a friend of mine and just by comparing how different our experiences were with the same missions, I can tell how complex and deep this game's gameplay truly is. On the graphics side of things: Stellar. The game looks beautiful, and runs almost maxed out at 60fps even on my low to mid teir rig. You'd be forgiven for thinking this requires a ludicrously powerful PC. My only possible complaint is that the FOB online missions don't seem to be working right now, though that's more a problem on the server side of things than the actual game itself.  10/10",

            "review_text": "37 hours into the game and I'm only 27% complete. This game is honestly one of the best I've played in a long time.  I haven't paid attention to the metal gear story as this is one of the first I've played since I was about 13. I'll be honest, the story is hard to follow for me. Maybe it's because I'm just stupid and not understanding some of it, but it is a bit janky compaired to others stories. Right from the start it grabs you though. It peaks your interest and shows you how beautiful this game is graphically. You're quickly coming to your senses as to whats happening around you. The voice acting pulls you in. The facial motions make you feel like its real.  Occasionally some of the story missions feel like filler ones, like you go here and get one guy then you're done. Maybe I'm just misunderstanding the story again though. However when there are cutscenes it is intense. The story really progresses. Something that is known as a side quest, like getting a new buddy (follower) feels like its part of the main mission. Your buddys will be in cut scenes with you.   This game is challenging. It is honestly one of the hardest games I've ever played. I'm not talking about mechanics. Gameplay is straight foward and unique at the same time. Play stealthfull or charge in there calling in heli support while firing your light machine gun or hiding behind your riot shield. What I'm talking about is your focus. You activly need to listen to things or your mission could go sideways. Without spoiling anything, deep into chapter 1 something happens that you need to control or else your crew could start dying. It is not a mission. There are no hints. It is up to you to find out what is causing this to happen. If you don't, bad things could happen, but you could still go on without solving this. Little things like that make this game intense. They make you express your mental skill in acomplishing things. It's not just mindlessly pressing buttons on your keyboard or controller like many adults may think.   In January of 2016 there is suppose to be a multiplayer component coming (Not FOB missions, I mean like team death match and all that). I played metal gear solid 4 and the online component for that was absolutely amazing. I had never played anything like it. I expect it to be great.  If you're on the fence about this game, buy it. It is one of the few games on this market that is worth the money you pay for it. And please buy it from a source that will help benefit this company. Kojima really deserves the support.   TL;DR: One of the best games this generation. Buy it.  Edit: I've finished it. Took about 55 hours total. Not 100% complete but beat the story. No Spoilers, but it was disappointing. Very generic and left you feeling a 'Phantom Pain'. Not very happy with this in that respect.   That being said,  Gamplay: 9/10  Graphics: 9/10   Cutscenes/Animations: 10/10  Character design: 7/10  Story: 3/10  I still recommend this game because of how much you get out of it.",

            "review_text": " The Phantom Pain  is a pretty special game. While undoubtley very polished gameplay wise, there's definitely something missing there story wise. Arguably, it has the weakest story out of all  Metal Gear Solid  games by Hideo Kojima. Not necessarily bad, but definitely a step down from the other games. While  Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots  had too much literal fanservice for its own good, it at least did feel like a proper conclusion to the overall story. Is this a case of Konami meddling, forcing Kojima to remove a lot of story sections in order to release the game on September 1st? Or is this Kojima's way of taking in the 'constant cutscenes' feedback? Who knows? We may never know, or at least not for a very long time.  But despite the hiccups with the story, the gameplay is nothing short of excellent. While the missions can be fairly repetitive, especially the side-ops, the overall feel of the game is extra ordinary, and a huge step-up from the other games in the franchise. The amount of ways you can do the missions, and the amount of personal restrictions you can put onto yourself is simply overwhelming. It's extremely fun to experiment new ways of playing and discovering new ways to complete a mission. Building your base isn't too different from the way you did it in  Peace Walker , but there are a few tweaks that overall makes it a more fully fleshed-out system.  Though one has to wonder if this is really  Metal Gear Solid 5 . While Kojima has pronounced the title as five, to him, it's in actuality  V . Because despite  The Phantom Pain  (together with  Ground Zeroes ) and  Peace Walker  being continuations of Big Boss's story that started in  Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater , just like the safe-to-say spin-off  Portable Ops , none of them are in fact numbered, signaling that the main series really did end with  Guns of the Patriots , and everything else are just supplementary materials. None of these three games were ever really necessary stories that needed to be told, as  MGS 4  did end every single plotline from  MGS 1-3 . And truth be told,  MGS 3  is the only story in Big Boss's life that's important to the overall story of the series; While it did not show us how he became the villain, it did show us the start of his descent as a hero.  As for the controversial ending   I was initially against it, primarily due to one of the reasons why I was so hyped for this game was exactly because I wanted to see Big Boss turn into the Big Bad. After following him through  Snake Eater ,  Portable Ops ,  Peace Walker , and  Ground Zeroes , naturally I wanted to see  the  moment the transformation really happened. But after thinking about it, it was actually a  pretty good  farewell from Kojima to his fans, as we are Venom, and he is Big Boss. We built this series together, and it will never be over as long as we continue to play the games.  So story wise, I have my problems with it. But meta wise, much like  Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty , it's an amazing message from the developer to the player. Still, one could argue that Big Boss's actions in this game, despite not being there, are indeed very villainous and hypocritical to his own beliefs, 10-20 years ago.    Either way, having been a fan of this series for almost 15 years, I can safetly say that  The Phantom Pain  does offer some form of closure, not as a story, but to me as a  player  of this legendary saga that will never die.   Here's to you, Kojima. I don't regret playing any of your games,  The Phantom Pain  included.",

I suggest playing the previous MGS games before playing this one as the story will confuse you a lot and I won't say much about the story here due to spoilers but I will say it's kinda weak.

Those unfamiliar it is not a held guide along a beautiful path, but a mouintain path frought with peril above some of the most treachourous of lands.   BUT   it is a road worth walking, for both the unseen &amp; the veterans.  WHY? the history and depth alone should merit this, but alone it does not. Alone it is but a fragment of what could be the understatment of the year. The rich depth behind every character goes a long way, the smaller references invite multiple fascitudes of story and enlighten worldy players of their backstory. Inevitably each moment is both profound for old and enlightening for new.  It provides multiple types of gameplay, using open world mechanics, inside a mission driven structure, using strong Ai &amp; consistent character development to make each play a strong willed push into the unknown. Each mission is thought out as to approach it anyway YOU choose. Are you the sniper that likes to hit and leave? would you prefer to CQC yourself some enemies and get some new recruits? or just going for that masterfullly stealthy assassin play and get in and out unseen...or go in guns blazing. Ultimatetly the decision is yours. This is why it makes a massterful game.  HOW? The game gives sense of purpose to every slight connetation it has. From subtle story elements to overly dramatic crazy gunfights with enemies that look as though they've been forged by a love of anime and giger alike. Ultimately the purpose behind each story element and every mechanic has weight. Nothing feels like a poor attempt, nothing feel's floaty, nothing belittels itself after 10 hours or more. Each mechanic in game, from hold up's to the careful use of stealth to infiltrate has had minor tweaks from other games, further development &amp; weight added.  This feels more like a culmination of the series, gathering all the quirks and problems and eviscerating them entirely. Giving HUGE plot point's and dialog pieces enough space to breathe, but enough screen time as not to bore those who just want some action.  THAT GOOD? In a word YES  In many YES but, we have a game here that achieves so much it would be silly to belittle the smaller pieces of game that bare no weight or have trivialites, these have been put in becasue of the fan's love for the series, hideo kojima's masterpiece is here. His being in game's has spiralled to this point. Whether we see more from him in this light is uncertain, but what is certain is that this is his pinnacle currently.   It would be a shame for anyone to miss out.",

The last time I played a Metal Gear game was in 2004 when Snake Eater came out for the PS2. Loved everything about that game.  Fast forward to 2015 and I am even more obsessed with this title than I was when I was younger...and this time, it's on PC! I have to say, this 'game' is a work of art. Everything about this game is beautiful and it runs INCREDIBLY well on the PC.  For those that say the server issues are ongoing, get over it. It has zero impact on your ability to play, and same goes for those of you that want to upload your saved data from Ground Zeroes - you can still do all of that, you just simply can't customize your emblem and other things when you can't connect to the servers. This was one of the most highly anticipated game releases of the year...they are entitled to have some server issues.  Cheers to you, Mr. Kojima and the entire team at Konami.

This game is solid, with compelling characters, superb gameplay and decent pacing. Simple changes like letting you listen to codec conversations while you infilitrate zones (instead of pausing the game), making C4 incredibly fun to use and cutting down on overly long cutscenes does wonders for the gameplay.   Which makes it all the more saddening that the game is an unfinished product.   The first 30 episodes of the game are the first Chapter. After you finish that, you get a 'sneak preview' of the next Chapter where you fight some more bads. That Chapter then goes ahead and begins and then just... stops. Sputters out. I literally found out I'd already beaten the entire game by going to GameFAQs looking to figure out how to unlock the next mission.   Don't get me wrong. The gameplay in this is sublime. If you're given an objective to destroy a Soviet convoy, you could just equip a rocket launcher and start chucking rockets at them until there are only craters left. But you can also set up a series of roadside bombs on the roads ahead of a Soviet convoy and blasting them all apart in the course with the push of a few buttons. The controls meanwhile are tight and you can go between sneaking up behind a soldier to knife them up to sniping a sentry on the other side of the base seemlessly.   But... it just feels like there was supposed to be so much more. I personally was expecting an entire new area, maybe snow themed or something. Instead, the game just stopped.   Disappointing.   Still... in the final analysis, my conclusion is that this game is good enough to redeem the many sins of Hideo Kojima, while simultaneously ensuring that I regard Konami with permanent suspicion.",

            "review_text": "Looking at some of the reviews you see statements like 'boring', 'repetitive' and 'too easy'. But what I think alot of people don't understand is that The Phantom Pain is an open world sandbox. Repetition, difficulty, fun; it's all up to you. When you go into the field as an operative in Afghanistan and Africa, you are given tools and a sandbox. This isn't a game that dictates or gives you instructions on how to play.  That's why this game is so brilliant. If you are a naturally creative and imaginitive person, you will have alot of fun. Here is a simple example: increase difficulty. Remove silencers from any hip weapon and this will encourage more tactical stealth oriented gameplay and adds pressure to not engage enemies or become spotted. This is just one simple and basic change that can effect gameplay greatly.  If you go about playing TPP the same way every mission you will become bored very quickly. Experiment and think outside the box. It's alot of fun. Remember Kojima has given his fans the tools and sandbox to create their own unique experience. I'm on my 2nd playthrough at the moment and still find fun and unique ways to go about the game, even side missions I have done countless times.  If you are on PC I reccommend the hardcore mod on nexus. Limits ammo, enemy sight range and many other parameters. It's a really good game in my opinion and like I said, if you are a naturally creative person you will find many hours of fun in this game.  For me personally:  Gameplay - 10/10 Story - 9/10 Music/Audio - 10/10 Quiet content to make you discretely get a chub - 10/10  EDIT: After finally finishing the game on my 3rd playthrough (First playthrough my save got wiped, second playthrough I got right up to mission 47 but got busy with life stuff) I can honestly say the ending isn't all that bad like some make it out to be. Yes we all would have loved the god-like 3rd chapter but considering what Kojima was going through with Konami (♥♥♥♥onami) we have been given a somewhat satisying ending and this will forever go down as one of my all time favourite games.",

Some thoughts quickly though: The gameplay is varied to a very satisfying degree and feels polished in all areas, you have tons of options in how you approach missions/scenarios, the game feels very immersive, great voice acting, cassette tapes are actually very entertaining to listen to with great information. Troy Baker sounds a bit too much like Joel here, but that is just a personal complaint, he is becoming my new Steve Blum in that when he plays a role, I can only hear the Voice Actor himself instead of the character.  So far the PC port has been near-flawless for me (I have an issue with the 'emblem creator' but it is not hindering my enjoying of the game)  The game itself maintains a steady 60fps at the highest settings and I have had no other issues. I use a PS4 Controller with DS4Windows. I'm impressed with the quality of this PC version - also it has been patched a couple times since release already (today is 9/3) which is a good thing.  Overall I'm really quite impressed with this game so far and I know things are only going to get more intense in the story, I can't wait.",

First of all, you'll have to bear with first 2-3 missions, where the devs are going to explain you how to play this. You'll get to know main characters, story about what the hell is going on (Partilly at least) and meet some people from previous parts of the MGS series. And after that, you are pretty much free. Do whatever mission you like and the way you like it. You could try a sneaky stealth approach or brutally charge right into the battle. Lethal/Non-Lethal. Ranged/Melee. Long range/Close range. Man, you can even make your own personal universal gun for all kinds of tactical situations... Mine was lethal with non-lethal gas grenades launcher for just in case, silencer and sniper scope...

Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain fails to deliver in almost all of those aspects to the point where sometimes it doesn't feel like a Metal Gear Solid title. It’s hard to say if most of it, if not all, is a consequence of the controversy surrounding the game’s development and release or of Hideo Kojima’s shift in priorities, regardless, this is what we got.  It might be a “disappointment” for some long time fans of the series and to explain how and why would mean serious spoilers, not just for this game but for the entire series, but suffice to say that despite all of that it remains a solid title with fun and engrossing gameplay that rewards experimentation and it packs serious amounts of content.

There are a number of different ways you can go about completing any given mission. You're also going to get a lot of game time for your money from this one. At 79.2 hours, I've only achieved a 56% completion rate.   The graphics look pretty incredible overall in this game. The fox engine is very well done, and it makes me wish Kojima would have been able to somehow get the older Metal Gear games on it.   The not so good: The narrative isn't quite as strong as some of the other games in the series. A lot of information is tied to listening to casette tapes, which I don't consider very ideal. The game is divided into two chapters, and the second feels half baked. The ending was rather abrupt.   My other gripe with the game is that there is a lot of repetition which does take away some of the enjoyment. There are times where I was immediately sent back to an area I just performed a mission in, to find that guards were fully staffed again, as if I hadn't just been there hours earlier (in game time). I would have enjoyed some extra areas in the game.  This repetition rears its ugly head the most in chapter two, where a number of missions are literally the same ones from chapter one but with harder difficulty.   Overall, I did enjoy my time with Metal Gear Solid V. If you're looking for great stealth gameplay, it's hard not to recommend this.     ",

            "review_text": "[No spoilers ahead] There is something wrong with MGV I'd like to share. First, it goes without question that this game is a pure masterpiece. The sheer amount of work, applied in all the right places has made a game which has everything for everyone. Normally a bad thing, but games are not normally made with Kojima's guiding vision. All in all, The Phantom Pain is the most cinematic and emotional experience a game medium can offer, pleasing both technically and aestetically.  In fact, it's so great that any imperfection within is taken as a horrible personal offense. To me? It's AI. Although NPC enemies are smart where it counts, I've yet to experience an adequate AI response to armored vehicles. I mean you could just drive around in your neon pink APC with a huge 'DD' on it and shoot people in the face, with only reaction from enemies standing right next to you being 'Huh? CP, we have a sign of intruder here'. Somehow, it's hard to feel like Snake after that.  Since today's market forces you to pander to the majority, the AIs are also ridiculously easy to kill. The only bleak sign of challenge are bossfights. (I am fine with a Skull taking 4-5 tank shells to kill, but why wouldn't they even flinch or react to it in any other way?) Getting a high mission grade is supposed to act as a reverse difficulty level, however, I've had facestomped missions with multiple enemy alerts and still have managed to get an S or A. Moreover, the motivation to get a high grade lacks a piece, too. The rewards are unclear, and since everyone is a winner (ugh), are practically useless. Do I recommend it? Most definitely yes, I do. The small quirks (That superhuman sniper always hits a helmet instead of a face. lol) are what they are: something to rant about.   About techical part: the Fox engine makes MGV running silky smooth even while streaming on FHD-high on my not-so-young rig  - i5-2400 (50% load when idle) - R9 280x - eats over 1Gb of RAM",

Pros:  +++Probably the best stealth mechanics of any game ever. Truly the technical apex of MGS +++literally hundreds of hours of content ++Great mechanics of building up mother base ++Excellent introduction ++Beautiful graphics +Tons of great songs and the ability to have your chopper play it on loud speaker. +Nicely integrated online component +Lots of collectibles +The Hamburgers of Kazuhira Miller   Cons:  ---Broken plot that's confusing even for Metal Gear standards. ---Bad pacing in terms of story, often broken up with tons of filler missions. ---Rushed ending that makes the game feel cheap --Boring characters. Ocelot is boring, Kaz is boring (except for in a certain casette tape), Huey is annoying. They managed to make Ocelot boring, and a southern American despite the fact he was raised in the USSR (the game even shows that his first language is russian). --Useless buddy system, especially if you play without markers (wallhacks) like I did. --Tons of ♥♥♥♥ that's never explained --Casette tapes replacing both the codec AND cutscenes. You could play the whole story without listening to these and miss so much exposition on why and what you're doing. -Forced Moby ♥♥♥♥ references that's supposed to be 'thought provoking' but ends up just remind me of After Earth. -Feels like KojiPro just threw in as much random ♥♥♥♥ that they've been wanting to do for awhile. There is either a stupid 'get it out of the way' explanation of the strange ♥♥♥♥ that occurs or something stupid like 'parasites,' this game's new nanomachines. -Nothing discourages you from fultoning literally everything, which gets kinda ridiculous at a point.  Overall, MGS5 succeeds in the stealth gameplay department but fails in anything regarding story. This means that the fault lies with Kojima himself because he has very little to do with gameplay and only writes and directs. Now, before I get a bunch of 'KONAMI ♥♥♥♥ED HIM' I want those who played to think back on Chapter 1, was it really great? Think about those first ten missions. The only powerful scene in the entire game was almost near the exact end, and it was extremely well done.     Port quality: 10/10  - 60 FPS highest settings on everything but shadows, 1080p, mid-range hardware from 3 years ago.  Gameplay: 10/10  - Completely holds the game together as it's the shining gem in the pile of ♥♥♥♥ that is 'the story.'  Story: 5/10  - Bad. You'll just have to find out yourself as to why, but for those who played, i bet you know what I mean.   Overall: 8-9/10  - solely because the amount of hours this game has held my interest and porbably the best stealth gameplay on the market.",

So I bought Ground Zeroes and liked that and when The Phantom Pain was released I was eager to get playing. Nearly 300 hours later I have 99% completed the game, only a few collectibles remain to be found.   It's a great open world stealth game. The sense of detail in the game is awesome, from the animarions and models for the characters to the way enemies and sidekicks behave. You can play the game however you like and there are consequences for any decisions you make. You can go Rambo and run and gun on missions but you will gain a reputation, become jaded and your enemies will adapt to counter your tactics. You can play stealthy and with non-lethal weapons to become the legendary merc amongst the private armies and so help build your own force at Mother Base.  You can play through the missions and have the story play out accordingly and this would take less time. However if you're a completionist and want to get every trophy, 'S' rank every mission and find all collectibles then there will be a lot of grinding. The pacing of the game could have been better, Chapter 1 is strong but after that missions can become a bit repetitive and there are too many similar side-ops IMO - still there are some great story elements in Chapter 2 that will keep you playing.  The game is over the top with some WTF moments and stand-out story scenes. There is horror, humour and sadness. I enjoyed every minute.",

            "review_text": "THIS IS THE FULL REVIEW OF: 'METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN'   Pros  *Powerful mix of cinematic and emergent gameplay *Clever systems that adapt to the way you play *Tense, exciting and unpredictable *Storming set-piece sequences *Incredible graphics  Cons  *Infrequent checkpoint that punish your stupidity and impatience *Occassionally struggles to get started -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    If this really is Hideo Kojima’s last Metal Gear, then you can't accuse gaming’s great auteur of going out with a whimper. The Phantom Pain is everything you ever wanted from a Metal Gear Solid – and possibly all the things you ever wanted from all the Metal Gears crammed into one crazy last instalment.  Want the complex interlocking systems of MGS3? You've got them. How about the cinematic drive and gangs-all-here fan service of MGS2 and MGS4? Well, that's here too. Like the knock-out recruiting and army management of the PSP’s Peace Walker? It turns out that there’s room for that as well. And the emergent, open-world gameplay of Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes? Well, you hardly needed to ask.  There's also space for all of Kojima's varying obsessions, ranging from pointed looks at cold war politics, revolution, capitalist greed, western hypocrisy, war and violence, to echoes of the movies and music he loves. There are weird in-jokes, bizarre head-scratching moments and young women clad in outfits so revealing that it could be months before we entangle whether we're looking at a satire of gaming sexism or just the sexism itself.  Most of all, while it's a game that takes itself pretty seriously at times, The Phantom Pain can be knowingly ridiculous and playful. From some bizarre side activities to new variations on the good old cardboard box, MGS V is nowhere near as po-faced as it could have been, even if it’s the darkest MGS of all.  One criticism of Kojima has always been that his cinematic pretensions sometimes get in the way of the gameplay; that he'd rather you sat back and watched the movie than played the lead. Kojima seems to be toying with the idea himself in the prologue; one of the greatest sustained gaming sequences I’ve played this year or any other. Linear, but jammed with taut set-pieces, shock moments and extraordinary build-ups of suspense and release, it’s an absolute stormer, and by the time Kojima has pulled in some of his trademark oddball villains – adversaries to rival MGS3’s Cobra Unit or Metal Gear Solid’s Foxhound – you’ll be ready for some formidable action scenes and a storming climactic chase.  This, it turns out, is The Phantom Pain just winding up.  Next we’re off to Afghanistan, and it’s here that The Phantom Pain’s true character emerges. This is the open-world, emergent tactical espionage of Ground Zeroes, only played out on a truly epic scale. The map is huge, and while mountain ranges impede your progress, you can traverse it completely on foot or – more sensibly – on horseback.  There are missions to complete, starting with a daring rescue of old comrade Kazuhiro Miller, but how you complete them is up to you. Come in at daylight or at night. Make your way through villages and guard posts, killing, capturing or simply evading Russian soldiers.  While the game holds your hand a little through the early stages, the actual way you do things – and even the time of day that you do things – is pretty much up to you.  And there’s more to do here than just completing missions. As in Peace Walker, your foes can be knocked our rather than slaughtered, then captured through the Fulton Recovery System – the bizarre, balloon-powered ground-to-air retrieval system that’s all the odder for being based on a real-world contraption. Captured troops are then converted into new and fully willing employees.  Before you know it, The Phantom Pain has you not only worried about your main objectives, but busily stealing resources and capturing troops to cover the ever-growing needs of Snake’s new Mother Base. Beyond your main missions – mercenary contracts sponsored by different players in the Afghan wars – you’re engaged in side ops to weaken the Russians, grab vital blueprints and target promising if initially uncooperative new recruits.  Movement and combat work pretty much as they did in Ground Zeroes, meaning the skills you’ve developed there are transferrable to the new game. While the sheer number of options makes for a fairly complex set of controls, it’s all surprisingly fluid and intuitive, with context-sensitive close-quarters combat and cover manoeuvres and shooting that flips quickly between third-person and first-person views as the situation demands.  However, The Phantom Pain also sees the addition of the D-Horse; the first of several ‘buddies’ you can call on during your adventures. Sorry, Roach, but D-Horse is the finest steed yet found in a video game, beating the Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption’s equine chums with a mixture of smooth controls, believable horsey handling and a great set of sneaking and galloping manoeuvres.  You’ll need all your moves, plus D-Horse’s and more, because The Phantom Pain really isn’t interested in giving you an easy time. The missions are designed to make you work and force you to plan and be strategic. Even early on it’s clear that Snake’s most boring gadget – binoculars with scanning technology and a built-in zoom mic – might actually be his best, because you can spot and tag Russian troops so that they’re always visible within your current view, even when in the distance or concealed behind a wall.  Missions are designed in a way that you’ll nearly always have to deal with some of these goons, and they’re always just smart and organised enough to pose a threat. They’ll return to their patrols if you go to ground and keep quiet, but raise an alert or keep stirring up the hornets and there’s predictably hell to pay. While the all-guns-blazing approach works in some situations, The Phantom Pain likes you to play things quieter, smarter and more patiently.  Luckily, you have the tools for the job. Not only does Snake have his own moves and gadgets, but you can play the environment to your advantage. Dust storms, for example, might restrict your vision and movement, but they also do the same for your enemies, making it possible to sneak into the heart of a base if you’re quick and clever about it. An unplanned explosion or skirmish can be catastrophic, but you can also twist it to your advantage, hoping troops will race towards the point of contact to find you, leaving security weak elsewhere. Ground Zeroes encouraged and rewarded just this kind of improvisation. The Phantom Pain goes much further.  Missions run the gamut from straight destruction and demolition missions to hostage rescue missions, recon missions, infiltrations and assassinations. Some can be tackled in minutes within a small area, while other require you to traverse half the map, dealing with guard posts, recruiting and pinching resources all the way.  Debate will rage over whether it’s the best, but The Phantom Pain is very arguably the ultimate Metal Gear, grabbing the best ideas, themes and mechanics from every game in the series, then forging them into one coherent whole. It’s set in a believable open world of complex, interlocking systems, yet it still has tension, drama, plenty of Kojima weirdness and some serious cinematic power. The Phantom Pain might be hard on body and soul at times, but you really don’t want to miss it.",

            "review_text": "Ah, Metal Gear, my first gaming love. I remember going over to my friend's house in 1998 and playing Metal Gear Solid. I was blown away. Every game before that I had played was clearly a 'game'. MGS seemed to be so much more. Its presentation and cinematography was unlike anything I’d ever seen before. It made me take games seriously as an art form and not just a fun way to pass the time. I have played every main-line Metal Gear since then and hold the series very near and dear to me. To say that I was looking forward to The Phantom Pain would be an understatement.  Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a very, very good game. Upon it's release, it was widely critically-acclaimed by most major outlets and earnings many '10/10' ratings. While I don't want to argue over decimal points, I do agree for the most part the MGSV is a fantastic game. I'm just not sure it's the Metal Gear game that I wanted.  The mechanics in The Phantom Pain are far and away the best in the series and I would say flat out great. The gunplay feels crisp and the stealth feels better than ever. My only gripe would be traversal (specifically climbing) but it's very minor. The open-world approach to the series works very well in my eyes. It’s open enough to feel big but not overstuffed with useless filler (a la Ubisoft games). The Fox Engine is magnificent and the game looks fantastic and is incredibly well optimized. Hopefully Konami decides to sell or license it because it would be a shame to see such a great engine languish. Many people tend to criticize the stories of Metal Gear and call them nonsensical, but I thoroughly enjoyed the story for the most part and found it more coherent than other entries (looking at you Sons of Liberty). Although while I enjoyed the story, its execution was also my biggest gripe…  To me, one of the pillars of a Metal Gear Solid game is cutscenes. I love the long, sometimes exposition-heavy cutscenes. I love the way Kojima directs these scenes and they were particularly great in Phantom Pain. My problem is there just weren’t enough! Most of the games’ story is delivered in the form of cassette tapes which can be listened to pretty much anywhere, whether it be during a mission or waiting in your chopper. It’s clear that the inflating budget of this game scared Konami and forced Kojima to cut corners. I just found it tedious to have to sit in the chopper to listen to these recordings and listening during a mission ran the risk of being cut off by radio dialog. It just seemed like a cheap way to fit in story. I enjoyed the story that was presented just not the presentation. I would have much preferred cutscenes instead. Adding to the Konami cut is, unfortunately, the true finale of the game. I don’t want to say much because of spoilers, it’s just disappointing that we didn’t get the true ending the Kojima had wanted.  I thoroughly enjoyed my 60 hours with The Phantom Pain and would comfortably recommend this game to almost anyone. I am a bit saddened that we will never get another true Metal Gear game, but this is a very high note for Kojima to depart the series on. For a franchise that I care so deeply for, it was great to enjoy the ride and embrace the camp just one more time.",

If you've played MGS before (especially Peacewalker),   Phantom Pain takes a fairly large lead from Peacewalker and that Fulton Recovery System is still around, so have fun watching things scream as they go rocketing skywards. Additionally, it feels like Hideo Kojima took his lead for MGS 5 from Hideaki Anno, the creator of Neon Genesis Evangelion.

However, gameplay of this game is just WONDERFUL! Beside MGS4 The Phantom Pain has the best gameplay from all the MGS games. Open-world structure, huuuuuge amount of gadgets, weapons and tools, very good enemy AI, hundrets of possible ways to finish missions and greatness of every single detail of the game (even falling cardboard box can be used as a weapon if u know how to do it) makes the gameplay epic. It's like a delicious mix of Hitman: Blood Money, Just Cause and MGS of course. Also, the missions score system is very well measured and it doesn't punish any style of playing - it rewards not only stealth or tactical approach, but also 'Rambo' style - but in different way. Additionaly, PC conversion is great - I can play The Phantom Pain on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop on high settings with stable 30fps. I've finished MGSV on PS3 before I bought PC copy, and PS3 version has of course worse graphics than PC and framerate sometimes drops slightly below 30fps. However, controls on PS3 feel better, but that's only because of great Dualshock 3 support.  Nevertheless, for me MGSV is GOTY 2015. 10/10.",

However I did play MSG 1 and 2 back in the day  I do enjoy the older hitman games , dishonoured, deus ex... (games where you get the choice of approach.)  This game however expensive.. really nails that formula. I don't care if the games sometimes throws a D at me.. I'm having fun with it.   Gameplay is so well done in this game, it's like a work of art on it's own.   I am loving the AI. I also like the forgiveness factor that they've put in, you can take quite a few hits. I think it works well in contrast with no saves during the mission which i usually dislike.  To me a game is epic when the genre/style is not really your thing but the game just draws you in regardless. Also, I just know when I'm 5 missions in and already I'm doing all the possible sidequests and upgrades available.  I can honestly see this game is epic and runs smooth as butter (AMD-software). This is 10 better than however i remembered the franchise from back in the day. Never though myself having so much fun in an MSG game.   As a small piece of critique : The intro part is a real drag, sure it builds up momentum ,but I'd be happier if i could skip the entire hospital scene. Didn't like the 'you can't move for scrap' bit.  Also a big relief in a time of bad ports and optimisations..  Jaw-dropping epic experience",

Enemies adapt to your playstyle. -The watergun is useful. -Quiet is useful AF.  Cons: -Bad Metal Gear game to start with, as you have no idea who Kaz, Ocelot, or Huey are. -If you're impatient, prepare to be seriously rekt. -The watergun can't knock out a guy easily. -Quiet is only useful after you've bonded with her and suffered past her useless phase.",

Main points to consider, like everyone is saying, is that this game didn't follow the normal MGS style.   Every Metal Gear that came out since MGS Twin Snakes, has been about a really crazy awesome story, that's so weird it's good, with stealth being a necessity, and lest we forget the incredbily long cut scenes.   This game was different. I'm not even mad about David Hayter being replaced, because Keifer Sutherland is a great replacement, and from the amount of '24' I watched, Jack Baurer's personality fits Big Boss really well. With this game I was kind of rushing through the missions because I keep waiting for the next great amazing cut scene, but this game was more about the actual gameplay. This is a big slaunt berry mcgee for me, because cut scenes are my favorite things on earth, and MGS always had movie long ones.   What I liked about the Metal Gear series is how linear it was, and I while I do MGS 5's sandboxish gameplay, I really don't care for sandbox games. I think 90% of sandbox games I get because of good advertising and storyline, but I also never finish them.   This Metal Gear is like Disney's Star Wars, I'm gonna play it/watch it because I loved the series, but when I see another death star in the trailer I get a bit sad inside.   I felt like with MGS4 a lot of people played it for the first time because of the hype, and that had a lot of storyline that only fans understood... But I feel like this game was catered to have that idea, but in very small bits so Kojima could draw in the new crowd for gross sales.   It really is a fantastic stealth game by itself, and I would recommend you buy it, for die hard MGS fans, and for the new guys.   Any negativety I have is all based on being a long time fan, and even though I'm dissapointed, I still enjoy the gameplay.  Conclusion: the game itself is really fun, controls are great (except for the fact that the broz on console's have controllers to help out with their stealth, which just makes PC more hardcore, not impossible), everything about this game is great... Except from the perspective of an MGS fan. Buy it anyway, but long time fans will be dissapointed I think.",

It also has a pathetic online 'PVP' component with a cash shop--always good to see the wonderful aspects of mobile gaming trying their luck with the 'real', less gullible and slightly more sophisticated industry.  The story is all over the place, but coherent enough.  Have read some nonsense about the depiction of Quiet, the silent, mostly naked female companion being sexist, despite her coming across as both a strong and interesting character. I guess anything that doesn't depict women in 'all shapes and sizes', unattractive or some other garish shade of plain equates to sexism these days... I like the character. Though, I'll also happily admit to wishing for an increase in attractive male companions with some kind of aversion to clothing in games ;)  All-in-all, I think this is a great farewell from Kojima and easily outshines its predecessors. Not to mention the welcome addition of Japanese voice-overs (though, don't try switching between them after starting a game--different language states seem to equate to different games with different saves). Also, it's the first time ever that I've been able to commend a Japanese game for its English voice overs--they really are very believable/authentic--the previous Metal Gear Solid voice actors, especially the dear chap who did Raiden's voice... ugh.  Anyway, great game with a number of frustrating issues courtesy of poor business decisions and the general ethical attidue of Konami, but all-in-all, it's wonderful fun and thoroughly entertaining.",

This game is also proabally one of the most realistic(to a point) military style game as well as if stealth fails you have to go loud, or if the guards find a body they will look around and reinforce other areas and a ton of other cool things so honestly this has to be one of my favorite games ever, oh and the muliplayers okay I guess but if you are buying this game buy if for its single player seriously dont buy it for the multiplayer",

It feels much like MGS4, and despite things like health-regen the difficulty is there and definitely gets pretty high late game. The storyline is satisfying to a degree. There are some really interesting ideas as to be expected from Kojima, but I was left wanting more in the end. It seems like the game might have been rushed to completion by Konami at some point during the development of Chapter 2. In the grand scheme of things this doesn't hurt the game too terribly. There is enough plot advancement to keep you hooked throughout and the gameplay is solid. I can see why die hard fans might have gripes, and I do agree with some of them. Despite the stripped out 2nd chapter I was still mostly satisfied. Could they have done some things differently? DEFINITELY. Still overall I would give Phantom Pain an 8/10.

The story, however, is the worst it's been in the entire series. The entire ending was cut from the game, so you have to deal with a meh twist as the ending of the last game of such a story heavy series.

TL;DR: Give it a chance, it takes a bit to get traction. Remember to use the cardboard boxes to get around the base faster.  If you've played MGS before (especially Peacewalker),   Phantom Pain takes a fairly large lead from Peacewalker and that Fulton Recovery System is still around, so have fun watching things scream as they go rocketing skywards. Additionally, it feels like Hideo Kojima took his lead for MGS 5 from Hideaki Anno, the creator of Neon Genesis Evangelion. No, there is no little kid screaming I mustn't run away every two seconds.   TL;DR: Damn, it's dark - even for a MGS game. Also, its like Peacewalker on roids.  ",

He liked the idea so much that after 3 or 4 endings the game keeps going and then just stops. The last ending was cut from the game. You're replaying a mission you've already done but in 'extreme' mode and then the game just doesn't give you more.  Speaking of missions the design and balance goes out the window in the later missions, it's like they stopped paying attention. I like the idea of replaying old missions with new constraints but when they're used in place of new story missions I feel a little cheated.  Game is still real fun though. Plenty of options for tactics and approach to missions, an incredibly weird, serious and ridiculous story, a cast of lovable rogues and you can airdrop trucks onto stuff.

The game takes place in the mid 80's during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the reign of the Apartheid Government of South Africa. You play as the legendary Big Boss (Snake) as you complete various missions to build your private military and enact your revenge on those who have wronged you. Through the use of stealth tactics, or outright engagements you will traverse both Afghanistan and Africa to accomplish your goals. The game features an excellent array of gadgets that mirror various sci-fi devices, while also providing a wide variety of period fitting weapons to create the alternate-history 1984 world. For those new to the Metal Gear series this is an excellent game to start out with, with crisp controls and engaging game mechanics this is by far the best playing Metal Gear game.  SOFT SPOILERS AHEAD  For those of us with extensive experience in the Metal Gear universe, though, this game might be slightly lacking. While all of the above still applies, there are some who would say that this game features the weakest story in the entire series. With all the hype that was built up around the game, there are some who will find that this installment feels the least 'Metal Gear' of them all. That is not meant to defer you in anyway from purchasing the game however, this game is worth it for the gameplay alone. Although the story takes a back seat in this entry, it trully allows for the gameplay to shine. This is one of those games that feels less like a movie that is trying to be a game, and more like a game that knows it is a game. Because of this, if you have any interest in stealth games, Metal Gear games, or action games in general, this is one experience you will not want to miss.",

Graphics - 9/10 - This game is a great console port, It plays really well (60 FPS on 1080p) on a 270X or 960 graphics card. Even though the graphics are very good, there are games out there (Witcher 3 and others) that present a more detailed graphical experience.  Sound - 10/10 - Great use of sound and music. BTW, You are in for a treat if you love 80s songs.  Controls - 9/10 - I played this game using an xbox controller. The fire and camera controls are excellent however it is cumbersome to change some of the weapons. The game also does not do a good job explaining everything you can do on the iDroid (Quiet, I am looking to you).   Story - 9/10 - It is a crazy Kojima story embedded in all the MGS lore from the several previous games. I was able to follow the story even though I had only played MGS 1 and 2 on MSX computer in the 80s. Of course, to understand some of the nuances, I had to read a wiki here and there. There is also some criticism on the ending and I understand it.  Gameplay - 10/10 - It is a great stealth game. You can even play it as a FPS, if you like. There are several ways to approach each mission and some of the craziest do work. Everytime the game starts to feel like a walk in the park, there is a new twist on the scenery, or the story, or on your own team that changes the experience completely and this is great.  Overall - 9,5/10 - This is a great third person game. I recommend it to you. I spent around 90 hours, but I believe someone in a hurry would spend around 50 or 60 to complete it. I had far more fun playing MGS 5 than playing Witcher 3.",

            "review_text": "Alright I'm gonna give this a shot.  So I'm clarifying right now that this was only my third Metal Gear game (first two being Revengeance and Ground Zeroes) and I read several wiki articles to get up to speed. I found the story rather easy to follow and not too convoluted unlike the previous games in the series. Many people praise Kojima for his nutty writing and while I found it enjoyable to at least try and pay attention to as it led me along MGSV's cassette tape ladden story path.  But I'm not here to talk about the story too much. I'll just say that it's there for the fans but it's there in a more digestable manner. Shorter cutscenes and the removal of the codec system streamline the story and in a way tuck most of the details away for only people who truly care.  Now let's talk about the more exciting part of the game! The gameplay of course! I'm a big fan of stealth games, there's something very satisfying about sabotaging an enemy operation without anyone knowing that you were even there. I'm happy to say that the stealth elements in MGSV are fantastic. A very fluid cover system has been added so that all you have to do to take cover is move up next to the object you wish to hide behind. Plus you aren't tethered to that piece of cover either, you can leave cover whenever you want to with the flick of an analog stick (or the press of your S key).   The camouflage system makes a return. You can change your outfit according to the terrain you'll be operating in or simply use one of the sneaking suits to cover a broader range of operations.  You can now bring a companion into the field with you (some more useful than others) and a buddy can turn the tide of any bad situation.  Shooting is very fluid as well, although someone used to simply pressing the fire button will have to get used to readying the weapon first. Some weapons feel a bit too similar but with the weapon customization system that MGSV introduces you can make some pretty crazy combinations. You can turn an assault rifle into a sniper rifle, an SMG into a carbine, etc.   If you do get caught by the enemy going loud is a viable option. It no longer feels like a mistake to have to fight, it feels more like a natural escalation of events. Since Snake is a legendary soldier combating enemies feels pretty satisfying. Using a combination of CQC, wrestling moves, and well placed gun shots to clear a base was always radical.  The base management system is adds a nice organic element to the open world aspect of the game. Although I personally could do the without the FOB system (if it's not to your liking as well you can simply play offline and never have worry about some guy stealing your hard earned resources).   I have a few gripes here and there, like not being able to use your helicopter as a fast travel in the open world. I would've liked to fly across the map in the chopper between destinations! It would've been fantastic! Other minor problems arise here and there but they're hardly worth mentioning. I think the biggest issue is how online play increases loading times by a notable degree. This issue is more noticable on the Playstation and the Xbox but it shouldn't be terribly noticable if you've got a powerful machine.  Now since this is a PC port that I'm reviewing I guess I should address issues relevant to that. Thankfully there are no performance issues here folks! No need to worry! Although the PC controls are not great (especially on the menus) so I'd recommend using a controller for this one.  Overall I give Metal Gear Solid V a 9/10 for it's extremely fun gameplay and alright storyline. It's not a perfect game, but it's definitely one that you can get your money's worth out of.",

They made it similar to Peacewalker, in the sense that you capture people to lvl up the different departments of motherbase and get access to better equipment. You can send your soldiers out on missions... in Peacewalker, you could choose what weapons they used, what vehicles they could take, and it improved their chances. You could even watch them duke it out. Now it just automatically gives them what vehicles it deems necessary. Why can't I send a tank with them if they only have a 50% success rate?  Also I like the open world. It feels like I'm playing Farcry/MGS hybrid. That being said, it doesn't have much variety. It tends to look pretty much the same wherever you go except the marked points of interest. Another complaint is the lack of dialogue coming from Snake. It's like they paid Kiefer Sutherland so much that they couldn't afford to actually have him say things. MGS is all about the dialogue. You should be able to call every person you know and talk to them for hours. And then do it again in the next area. Now I can just point at something and Miller will tell me if they are Russian or something.  Also, I like the story. It's great. But as I beat it, I thought, this can't be over. I forgot that they cut the last mission. And it is pretty essential to the story. So that sucks.  MGO- Anyone that knows me probably understands my love for MGO. I played the last one from launch until it died. I honestly love the new one. It is a ton of fun. And it's only kinda broken. The last one was, well.. ♥♥♥♥ed. I really just had to suck it up and accept that it's a different game. Its very much different from the last one. The stages are bigger. Headshots are not so important anymore. I had a laundry list of complaints, but most of them really don't apply to this because it's just different. Those tactics wouldn't work anymore. It really just seems like they wanted this one to be friendlier. Less hardcore, if you will. The last one was a mean, nasty, game, but that was part of it's charm. You could lvl down. Easily. It was hard to be a high lvl player and it was a status symbol. There aren't clans anymore. No keyboard chat. I could write a novel about why it's different and why that bothers me, but it's awesome so, why bother. It will get better.",

The Chapter 2 was evidently rushed and Chapter 3 was entirely scrapped. The side missions are extremely boring as they get repetitive, barring the 'Important Side Ops' as they are linked to the story. The Afghanistan and Africa worlds are well designed but they still are not that great as there's no unique landmark or anything to explore as compared to open worlds of other games released this year like Witcher 3 or Fallout 4. The fast travelling mechanic takes me average 3 minutes to go from one place to another. The Mother Base, no matter how much you expand, has nothing to offer you whatsoever. There's nothing and I mean nothing is happening on the Mother Base. Hardly there are couple of attractions (Including an animal sanctuary).The end might leave a sour taste in your mouth if you are a die hard Metal Gear fan and by now you must be wondering why I gave it a solid 8/10.   The Gameplay. Period. It overshadows all the above mentioned issues and still makes it a 60 bucks game. I never felt so much in-control of a character in any previous game. And what was the icing on the cake was the Fox engine which never let the game fall below the 60fps no matter how many things are happening on the screen. Frankly I don't care if my game is capped to 30fps or 60fps, but I enjoyed the smooth frame rate while I was blasting through tons of vehicles and tanks. And yes, the game has re-play value.   It's a must buy. Kojima gave his best in making this one successful and it shows.",

            "review_text": "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is for those who like stealth games combined with a series of alternating paths and actions to complete their targets, be it the same mission played again or an entirely different one. I suggest someone with a strong liking of Stealth genres to play this game, as it provides a greater sense of accomplishment when carrying out and fulfilling objectives without running or gunning, but I'm not saying you cannot do that.  The visuals are life like. They are true to real life in terms of physics, graphics and colour. The Phantom Pain achieved this vivid colour environment that makes it all feel so real when on the battlefield and when you take a break and let it all in. The huge mountains, the vast deserts, the giant buildings. Konami really pushed on bringing a game where you are not focusing all of your attention on just gameplay.  Controlling the game is easy to learn, yet hard to master. There is a skill gap between killing 5 people in succession without notice and just spraying them all down. On keyboard and controller I found this game just as easy to play, except for aiming of course, mouse will always be superior, but thankfully there is a built in subtle auto-aim, so you'll find yourself locking on to someone you want to, and not 180-ing to some poor soldiers head.  Gameplay is utterly superb, it is what makes this game stand out from Triple A Games released this year (2015). Any casual or hard-core gamer can pick this up after a brief look into what's going on and get into it for hours, I know I have, and I plan to for hours more to come. You can scope out environments and find out what soldiers are talking about for hints and tips, see how good a soldier is based on their stats and use it to your advantage. You can steal anything you get your hands on, soldiers, containers, cars. You name it, It's yours.   TL;DR The Phantom Pain is a triple A game for a reason, be a hard-core gamer or casual gamer, you will find something you like in this game. Don't be put off by its Stealth aspect, it doesn't have to be. Think of this game as a sandbox game with a story and atmosphere that will keep you coming back for more, and the same thing never happens twice. ",

Every mission can be approached by a vast number of paths, and while the game may try to push you in certain directions, do what you want. There are so many different elements at play, like time of day, what supplies are reaching the enemy troops, how many times you've shot your silenced weapon, how long you've been in the mission... So many things to keep in my head! While I personally find the way some of the dialouge is written to be a bit cliche or cheesey, it fits the mood of the game and keeps you coming back for more. 10/10 would sneaky snek again.",

            "review_text": "Definitely worth buying. Once you sink your teeth into it for a few hours you'll see why. It just keeps getting better. Gameplay-wise, this is a gem. Some thoughts, in no particular order (and devoid of spoilers):  * Lots of customization, of pretty much everything, which always tickles my fancy.  * Buddies make your life easy, but in some cases, almost too easy. One in particular can basically take out entire guard posts for you. Before you get there.  * On a similar note, difficulty level jumps up and down unexpectedly, but stays within a good range. When you're good at what you're doing, it *will* feel like a cakewalk, until something in a mission catches you by surprise.  * The 'boss fights' are more like brief, playable intermissions in lieu of more cutscenes. I'm actually okay with this setup, but it's not for everyone.   * Snake is *almost* as quiet as... well, y'know. I didn't mind this so much at first, but when he's literally being asked a question and he responds with silence and a stare, it almost feels like watching a play where the actor forgot their line. But I guess if we stick with the 'he's just seen some sh*t, man' perspective on Snake's demeanor, it kinda fits... but it's still awkward.  * Fulton extracting everything is a joy.  * Being able to call in helicopters, buddies, ammunition, what-have-you, all of these tools at your disposal, it DOES make it a bit easier in open world and side-ops, but the game still finds ways to remind you that you're not invincible.  * Miller is a sh*t. I want to remove him from my team. Doesn't get prosthetics for his missing limbs 'to remind him of the pain'? Go listen to a Linkin Park album, you tool. Oh, and half the time you Fulton extract someone, he goes 'you're going to extract *him*?' condescendingly like you made a poor choice. It took a little testing to realize that he's not actually grading your choice, he'll say that for anyone. Yes, Miller, I am going to extract him. I'll extract whoever the hell I want. I'll extract 100 soldiers with E ratings in everything before the night is through, just because I don't want them to wake up, and I don't want to grant them sweet release (or waste my ammunition doing so) Why? What's it to you? What's my f*cking name?  * In lieu of repetitive audio, and without spoiling anything... HMMM-HMMM~, HMMM-HM-HMMM~  * Enemy AI is pretty solid. There have been a few occasions though where I've wondered how the hell I got spotted. Tip: your visibility in a sandstorm IS NOT reflective of the AI's. Conversely, there are times where I wonder how the hell I *didn't* get spotted. Particularly when the AI is focused on my buddy, but like, I'm right there, not 45 degrees off being straight ahead, and &lt;10 feet away, with an assault rifle pointed at their head.  * You'll get your FOB about a quarter of the way through the game. The cost of another FOB is absurd, roughly $15, and effectively impossible to get through the tiny rewards of 'MB' they occasionally give you. Not worth it just to get more income.   That's about all I can think of right now. I'm only 30% through at the time of this writing, I'm taking my sweet time and savoring the flavor. All in all I highly recommend TPP, it's a ton of fun.",

They added information about characters and the story, since the story was very confusing the tapes helped it.  * The buddy system is awesome! You can command your buddies to do stuff for you to help you in your missions, my favorite was Quiet.  *Mother base was truly amazing, its the best 'home base' i´ve experienced in a game. I also love the the ballon system where you can capture stuff and bring them to your home base fast, including Soldiers, Animals, Cars and more.  * Scouting bases before 'raiding them'. It really works well, it even works better if you have D-Dog or Quiet... but Quiet is way better in my opinion. You can also see the ranks of the soldiers that you want to capture wich is really helpful. Since you dont have an unlimited use of balloons.  * Graphics, They are awesome. Not mutch to say here, its also very well optimized.  * Directed by Hideo Kojima  * Different camos so you have to prepare for your fights and the same thing for your weapons. Though a bad thing is that i didnt have the time to upgrade all weapons, wish i had more time to do it.  * The awesome big metal gear. Cant explain it, you have to experience it for yourself, its really awesome. You really feel that its really big!  * The option to have your own music in the game, like its awesome to hear some edgy rock music coming on when the helicopter appears. hue :-)  * The A.I is very good. Soldiers will contact their peeps and tell everything they´ve seen. If you are in a cardboard box they will tell their mates, but they will just call him an idiot. So yep.  * Lots of more tiny stuff..  Cons :  * The story is very confusing for those who havent played it before, and the story gets even more confusing and weird in the second chapter  * Even though the A.I is good, it has its flaws, you will notice small things especially when you are holding someone in your arms.   Not mutch more but i wanna talk about Quiet.    Everyone is saying she is is just an object, But think about it, she cant talk to you and she wants to show it in different ways. But i agree her suit is revealing, luckily in about in the end game you can get a better suit that covers up everything. The ending actually made me care about her more with that sad song and everything. She isn´t objectefied. It just that she is revealing.     Im gonna give this game a 10/10. Truly a masterpiece, but its really sad with the chapter 3 contreversy. Because i really want 6439683489643689436 dlc´s to this. I would buy them all!   Buy this game right now, even if you havent played any other metal gears you should still get this. In my opinion this was all about the gameplay.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Buy the game on sale if you can. If not, then it's still a fairly worthwhile purchase.  +: The open world aspect allows for a freedom you don't see in other MGs.  +: The story (or rather, the piece Konami decided to leave in) is gripping; it holds on until it abruptly ends, then before you know it you're sitting there confused as to what the hell is going on.  +: Gameplay is, for the most part, smooth and familiar. Veterans and Newcomers alike will find that it's a very satisfying game, whether you're going for S ranks and Perfect Stealth runs, or rolling in with a tank to blow an outpost and all its occupants to Kingdom Come.  0: Microtransactions. They're completely ignorable, only being used to speed up Online Combat Deployments, build more than 1 FOB, and speed up expansions of FOBs. They also end up giving you a few as Daily Login Bonuses every so often, but the option to pay is always there.  0: DLC. You're seriously going to charge me a dollar to play in a Tuxedo? Why not, hmm...I don't know...release Chapter 3 and Episode 51? I'd probably but likely not pay to get the missing content, but if I did, I'd probably end up calling you pennypinching jews. Don't be EA, please. I beg of you.  0: FPS lock. You won't get above 60 FPS under any normal circumstances, and if you manage to unlock it by directly editing the game files, the physics in the game can get all wonky.  0: Controls. This is pretty much a direct console port. You can't use the mouse in menus, and it takes a little while to get used to the keyboard control scheme. Oh, and you can't rebind anything, at least not from the in-game menus. However, it's not the most terrible thing, and after finishing the first mission I was more or less acquainted with the controls enough to not have to worry about it.  -: Missing content. You left out possibly 1/3rd of the game, and you expect us to not notice? SPOILERS:    What happens to Sahelanthropus? What happens to that vial of the Vocal Cord Parasite (English) that Psycho Mantis takes? What happens to the helicopter of kids that Eli takes with him? Hell, what the flying ♥♥♥♥ happens to the helicoptor pilots? SUCH A LUST...FOR ANSWERS    -: Hackers. Konami has yet to implement any sort of anti-cheat into the game. Instead, they rely on player reports on their website. It's not that they're doing nothing, they're just doing, well, next to nothing.  Overall, if you're still on the fence about this game, even after all this damned time, I would definitely recommend it, on sale if possible. It's a pretty S O L I D game as it stands; could make do with some big improvements, but the problems don't hamper the game to a point that I just want to uninstall and not play it anymore (Hello, PAYDAY 2!). The game fits its job description well; the stealth mechanics are on point, the development and resource system encourages you to utilize the various methods of retrieving funds and said resources, and both the story and game itself are just a blast to experience.",

The story feels so disconnected and only at the end of ACT1 the missions really connect and tell a coherent story.   The core gameplay and feel of the game is great but sadly if your missions are 95.3% the same it gets repetitive and boring after a while. I mean you can only scout and infiltrate so many outposts until it gets boring.   The antagonist Skullface gets way too little character development and I wish we would have seen more of him and got to fight him in a boss fight. Furthermore his Skulls unit was used way too little and I think the missions that feature them are the best in the game because those ♥♥♥♥ers are just so creepy and interesting.   Recycling missions from Act1 in Act2 is a no go imo, should have just given you the ability to choose a higher difficulty when you want to play through them again.   The weapon development feels lackluster, I really hoped for a more complex system. Same goes for weapon customizations. it feels like 70% of the customization is just visuals that do not impact the performance of your weapon at all.   The lack of a good fast travel method is annoying. Shipping yourself to another outpost is a cool way on paper but implemented into the game it's really annoying. Furthermore making deployment take so long is annoying as well. I wish I had the option to skip that sequence cause after seeing it the 50th time it just feels like a waste of time and subtracts from the fun experience.   The graphics look good. I really can't complain about them but I also need to admit that my standards on that front are fairly low.",

My feelings of nostalgia with MGS 3 are very high, so this may make me sound biased, but I put the Phantom Pain around the same level as MGS 3, which is my favorite in the series. The port to PC is fantastic, which comes as a surpise when you see Japanese ports to PC as of late (I'm looking at you Square.) All in all though, I can say at the very least that this game is worth your $60 and then some.

Features that stand out:  - Fantastic stealth mechanics and movement - Superb combat mechanics - Open World gives you the freedom to tackle each mission your way - Great visuals and optimization, making this game run very smoothly on most modern PC configs - Story, the extremely long cutscenes are now replaced with a more forgiving approach, you can use tape cassettes to catch up on current events, while the custscene that are featured are all worthile and exciting. - Mother Base building is a fun addition that brings variation, sending your soldiers to missions which will net you rewards is a very cool way of introducing diversity in the gameplay mechanics. - The environments are very nicely created and authentic, couple this with a great 80's soundtrack and you got yourself a winner!  The not so great aspects:  - It is a MGS title, so expect allot of cheese added to the story, it is simply the nature of the beast, but if you are used to it by now having played earlier entries in the franchise you know as well as I do that it adds some charm. - A 'quiet(e)' likeable character is extremely sexualized, and the supposed reason for this is a blatant cop-out. - The game was clearly rushed to meet a deadline, chapter 2 and up use missions from chapter 1 as filler content, it is really a shame that the game is unfinished and has missing content, as its gameplay is superb, but with a rushed story and conclusion it leaves you feeling that you have played a game that had much more potential but never took advantage of it.  The 'professional' reviewsites giving it 10/10 are completely off, it is a great but unfinished game, in my book it gets a solid 8/10, due to the cut content and filler missions, it is evident that this could have been so much more, but the parts that it has, they work great and that is the only reason this game is enjoyable.",

            "review_text": "A Hideo Kojima Game.    Now that I've put some good 100 hours in this game I can write a proper review of it.  I've been a fan of Metal Gear ever since I can remember. I started with Metal Gear Solid 1 when I was around 4-5 years old, and so far I have played every game of the saga, so I have good knowledge of the game's background story.  Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain sets us 9 years after the events of Ground Zeroes, where the Mother Base we built as Big Boss in MGS: Peace Walker has been bombed to hell with all our staff in it. In this game we control Big Boss again who, along with Miller and Revolver Ocelot, seek revenge on whoever was behind the attack to Mother Base. In my opinion, this game, along with (or after) Metal Gear Solid 3 and Metal Gear Solid 4 is the game with the best story so far, it has some impressive turns of events and it closes nearly every doubt we can have about the first two Metal Gears (back when it wasn't Solid). Although if you're a fan of cinematics and codec calls like me, you're going to miss them in this game, there are no codec calls, they are 'replaced' with conversations recorded on tapes that you can listen whenever you want once you've unlocked them. There are still cinematics but not nearly as many as there could be in any other Metal Gear videogame.  The gameplay is fantastic, it's pretty intuitive, it makes action scenes easier since the camera is located behind you and gets on your shoulder whenever you're going to aim, the camera itself is pretty dinamyc and allows you to look around with no problems. Even though the gameplay is good for action it still has the touch it needs to help us complete every mission with perfect stealth. The game is divided in Main Ops and Side Ops (Just like MGS: Peace Walker) that you can complete and replay once they're available again. You can start these missions from your helicopter, which will get you to their location in no time. It also has an incredible replay value.  The 'Open World' concept was what most scared me about this game, I really thought they would ruin the game's essence making it have an open world, but oh boy, was I wrong. The open world concept is perlecty developed with 3 different instances, we have Afghanistan, Africa and our Mother Base which we can upgrade every now and then.  The sound and graphic quality in this game is better than you could expect, Kojima Productions did a really good job with the Fox Engine, you can see this as soon as you start the first mission, a bath of special effects that will be like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to your eyes. The sound, as usual, is one of the things that you will be noticing the most, as it is an infiltration game you will need to pay attention to every single sound you can hear, from footsteps to a soldier snoring.  The multiplayer is a bit dissapointing, so far (even though it's just a beta) it's just a 5-map multiplayer with little (close to nothing at all) customization, something that we really miss from the previous Metal Gear Online.  Another thing you may want to know is that KONAMI cut off a third episode that was in the making (probably when Kojima got fired from KONAMI and got his name removed from the game), that is something I honestly don't like at all. The game is still a very good game overall, but if you ask me, I wouldn't buy it at full price.",

I've been playing Metal Gear Solid since the first one on PlayStation. I have since played every game after that, including Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake from the HD collection, and after 30 hours I can say this game surpasses them all. I haven't beaten it yet, but, as someone who's enjoyed the story and mythlogy of this series above the amazing gameplay, because I can't wait to see what happens next with these characters, I've been surprised how distracted I've been with the extra Side Ops, managing my base and recuiting new Diamond Dogs to build my mercenary force as big as it can be. That requires a lot of time getting resources and going off mission to explore and find new soldiers, vehicles, weapons, plants, diamonds, and animals for MY FREAKING ZOO, to Fulton out and send back to base. I should be focusing on finding out what happens in the story of Big Boss, which I would normally be doing, but I'm having just as much fun working on my base, which I can't wait to see go from Diamond Dogs to Outer Heaven given the time this game takes place in.   There's also the online portions of the game, Forward Operating Base and Metal Gear Online. Forward Operating Base has you infiltrating online opponent's bases for resources they have and bringing them back to your base, but they can also defend their base from you, which is part of the exploring, getting more money through Side Ops, and sending your men out to do missions, which is exactly what a mercenary force would do. The gameplay feeds into the story so well, nothing is out of place or there just for the sake of it. Then there's Metal Gear Online which isn't out yet, but has you playing as a soldier that you can level up and fight in multiplayer battles with.   This is Hideo Kojima's masterpiece and it definitely earns that title.  I have yet to play a better video game.  Also: You can listen to Joy Division and The Cure on your iDroid during missions.  It doesn't get better than that.",

If you're a fan of the MGS series or stealth games in general I'd say it's definitely worth trying out as I found it to be one of the most enjoyable experiences of the last few years. The stealth play feels nice and makes you think and prepare a strategy to tackle objectives in certain ways (Or just shoot them up if you want to also).   Pros: -Great stealth gameplay -AI is smart and adapts to your style of play to combat you better (ie: Flashlights, helmets, body armor) -Tons of Content - I'm 200+ hours in and still having a blast with the game -Good replayability - tons of missions with differing variety and tasks to complete -Buddy system - Go into battle with your choice of a companion or machine with different abilities and uses -Mother base building - Really puts you in the shoes of a leader of a PF where you recruit, send them on missions and build a large base. -FOBs - Like a mother base but is open to invasion by other players (You can only lose resources mined or stolen online, no singleplayer resources will be stolen.) You're in charge of defending it and the people you choose to support. You can expand it the same way as the motherbase and make for some fun online 1v1s.  Cons: -Ending felt kind of weak and somewhat missing. -FOB Hackers - While not common, they can ruin the fun of having an FOB and make me question how MGO3 will be handled once released on PC  ",

I could hardly see a single meme. Nobody ever got in my box. Jack the Ripper was nowhere to be seen.  The pacing is pretty weird, with a microcosm of story near the end, but a noticeable lack of it in most other areas. The cassette tapes... just aren't as good as the Codec conversations. The Kojima quality writing is here, with all the eccentricity that implies, but just as much META genius.   The game did not go where I expected, or really wanted it, to go. I expected a more villainous side of Big Boss to be shown, and his slow descent into cruelty and false ideaology. I expected DAVID HAYTER.  But Kiefer Sutherland does a fine job.  Kaz and Ocelot needed more characterization. As what could be argued to be the two next main characters, their appearances are pretty repetitive, and their personalities aren't as dynamic as you would likely expect them to be.   Gameplay is good.  Here I will reiterate that the GAMEPLAY in this VIDEO GAME is pretty good. Really good. Eighry and up hours good.  As it should be.  It's a Hideo Kojima game.",

Hideo Kojima's directing makes this game even better, using cinematic 3rd and 1st person cameras to direct the viewer's attention in a way that embraces the story, magnifying the emotions off all the characters.  The gameplay is great and is one of the best 3rd person stealth games you can get. Players have to use the environment to their advantage, plotting out routes to get past or just run and gun the enemy but doing so hinders you from getting better soldiers which increase the skills of Mother Base’s 7 sectors: R&amp;D, Intel, Medical, Support, Combat, Base Development and Security Team that each play a role and can change the course of a fight.  The game has 3 main areas, Mother Base, Afghanistan and Africa, for the player to explore and find the many collectables scattered around. They each offer different gameplay styles and all have a unique feel to them with the settlements and their occupants.  For people who have not played any Metal Gear game before and are coming into this blind they can catch up by using the Cassette Tapes that also give the player more story to the main game. But veteran players will be welcomed back into the Metal Gear story with familiar characters with the Hideo Kojima style gameplay.  Overall the game has a ton of things to do and explore with its 50 Main Missions and 157 Side Ops that all feel unique and make the player think as enemies change and get smarter in addition to the system that will give them more armor or gas masks depending on how the player decides to take coarse of action. With hundreds of weapons and upgrades to make along with the new addition of Metal Gear Online 3, a free update that allows for team based Multiplayer with a standalone upgrade system will entice players for hundreds of hours trying to complete.  -Legominds ",

However, in its current state which conceptually is unfinished, it offers enough for a solid 100 hour playthrough (I only have 94 at the time of writing but I'll bump that up to 100 for approximation purposes).   The first chapter is very well done and the missions are very enjoyable. Not to mention that tactical possibilities that is offered to you throughout the game. Motherbase was fun to manage. It wasn't too tedious that it felt like I was playing a full blown simulation game but it wasn't too 'big-picture' either. As a stealth game, the stealth is great. The AI is a bit rough around the edges but its nothing unignorable.   What really fell through for me was chapter 2 where around 80% of the missions are the missions you've already done in chapter one but with added difficulty. Now that part irked me A LOT. I was able to look past it though after I did some research and found that the game's unfinished state is largely due to the Kojima-Konami squabble. Because the game was developed under those circumstances, I was able to look past that one fatal flaw that almost did it for me.  Another thing that I did not like was the lack of areas to explore. On paper, the game areas seem big. However as you do side ops you'll notice that you are simply going back to areas you have visited before. The first time you do missions though, especially main ones, the areas are fantastic and very detailed. The areas were very detailed and unique albeit lacking in number. I suppose I cannot ask for too much. Hence, I will forgive that as well because the quality compensates for the lack in quantity.   A lot of people complain about the side ops being repetitive but I for one like the numbness that goes along with doing it. It puts my brain in a state where I'm not thinking too hard but I am also still thinking. It's a good way to take a break in between adrenaline filled main missions. My only qualm is the lack of unique environments.  Overall, I would say buy the game. Metal Gear is a legendary series and MGSV is a good (not great) member of it.",

I love the crazy, complex and emotional narratives of the previous MGS games, that this one seemed to be missing. Kojima tried something new with the open world format and for the most part it worked. However it still feels like a shadow of a true MGS story. But the gameplay keeps you coming back for more!

There is a lot of content for completionists (maybe a little too much), the story will make you feel a variety of emotions (mostly awe from me), and the gameplay is pretty solid. It's a very good entry into the series.  Now I'm not the best at Metal Gear Solid games, so even I can tell that this game is quite a bit easier than the others, but of course I don't mind that. I think the single difficulty is an improvement more than anything, because I don't have to feel like a chump picking easy mode. It's nice that the game doesn't focus entirely on stealth either. Don't get me wrong, stealth is still very important to this game, but you have the means to go about most missions guns blazing without getting heavily penalized, and I think that having that option is a good thing.  For those who crave the older style of difficulty, halfway through the game you can unlock harder versions of missions, from ones with increased difficulty and removed Reflex time to ones where you have to go in totally naked. Even with those, trying to complete the missions with S ranks and perfect stealth isn't exactly a walk in the park - the improvement lies in the fact that you can complete them at all without perfect or even good stealth.  I will say that the gameplay can get stale with how long the game is, especially if you play too many side-ops. Listen to me when I say - do your missions. It'll progress the story and make things much more interesting. Do side-ops when you need a break but still want to play. or you're hurting for GMP (the currency of the game).  Overall it's a very good game and well worth the full price of admission for old or new fans of the series.",

Many people have pointed out that the open world is very empty, and I agree completely with that, but the sheer freedom that it allows makes up for the barrenness of the landscape. Also as many people have pointed out, the story is lacking in comparison to the other metal gear games. This was my first metal gear, so it didn't really matter much during my playthrough, but I liked it so much I decided to get some earlier games, and as I learned more about the series, MGS V's incompleteness became clearer. I highly enjoyed my time playing it, but it really is a half finished game (granted it is a huge half, expect 50+ hours). With Kojima departed from Konami, I doubt I will ever get that sweet closure, and that sucks. But with all that said, I still love this game to pieces.",

            "review_text": " TL;DR:   This game is meant for the people who played the previous Metal Gear Solid series with Kojima’s narrative and director skills in mind though being severely altered due to the game’s structure. It will answer almost all of the questions you had about several of the previous Metal Gear Solid games in terms of Naked Snake, AKA Big Boss’s plot line. There is multiple ways to sneak around NPC’s / Player’s bases that will challenge you and feel satisfying at times. Not to mention the vast amounts of weapons, buddy abilities, and Mother Base Abilities you get as you progress though the game.  However, be aware that micro-transactions alter the game in a way on forcing your hand on getting high leveled weaponry and armor as well as FOB expansions. On top of that, the grinding aspect of the game is collecting GMP (The currency within the game), resources, soldiers, vehicles, plants (I wish I was kidding on this.), and other things.   The Review:   METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN has a lot of mixed feelings with how I felt the 'Last Metal Gear Solid Game' was going to be. Without ruining any of the game's plot, there is a lot of things within this game that has you questioning a lot of things:     How come the story of the game has been reduced to episodic events rather than the linear, narrative path it was known for?    Why on Earth MB Coins or micro-transactions are within a Metal Gear Game?    Why are the main figure heads within the game is are given more radio dialog rather than cut scenes with in the game?    What happened to all the codec conversations that gave the characters within the game a bit of personality?   The story within this game follows the same narrative style within Portal Ops and Peace Walker. Within doing this, codec scenes that were common within the Metal Gear series is completely gone. You will not open up a separate menu in order to dial into a frequency to call people. Instead, pressing only one button will only give information on what you are currently looking at when aiming at something or where you are located at. That’s it. This along with the short cut scenes that often have you questioning why it was even there to begin with will also confuse you. There are some cut scenes within the game that explain the story but there are others that leaves you to interpretation rather than just telling you what is going on. You never know some of the plot lines within the game as it is still remains a mystery, characters that seem to have a personality within the game suddenly become dull and boring to listen to, and the only way to get the full plot line within the game is by listening cassette tapes that you either get by progressing through the game or finding/achieving within game through certain actions. You will get some enjoyment out of it, but soon to be forgotten in comparison to the other Metal Gear Solid Games.  The system of using 'MB Coins' within a Metal Gear game is something that caused a lot of controversy. It would make sense to have something like micro transactions within a game, but the way it is used is seriously flawed. It is used primarily as a clutch for players who need certain weapons or items developed that seems like a waste of time. In some instances you could be waiting an entire week or more depending on what you are developing. The game does give you MB Coins within certain days, but it is typically a rare thing to get on a daily basis and it’s considered receiving pennies rather than dollars amount of coins. So either you continue playing the game saving up MB coins just encase you wanted to speed up development on the main things you are researching onto or you wait x amount of hours or days. Overall, the MB coins seems like a rather dull mindset of the modern age of gaming where the person who is willing to cash out a lot of money for this game is typically the winner. Though, most players will not even use the special items, weapons, or armor based on the cost of GMP and resources.  Overall, this is a Metal Gear Solid game that seems to leave the player with a lot of unanswered questions that seems to be never explained. It is a new phantom pain to deal with now that the story comes to an end like this. Within the episodes and chapters within the game, one can only hope they would release several more episodes to explain parts of the story as well as new map locations to explore. But given the scandal with Kojima versus Konami, chances of seeing an expansion or DLC is far from being true. ",

            "review_text": "If you're unsure about this game because you're new to the series, get it anyway. I was unsure for that reason and took a chance and am very glad I did.  As a newcomer to the series I didn't really know what to expect but I had heard from a friend that the game was very good, and the tags intrigued me. The prologue wasn't too enjoyable because it was mostly story and not a lot of playing, but once things opened up, this became one of the best games I've ever played. I cannot believe how well-made this game is.  Bugs: I have to keep reminding myself how infrequently I notice problems with this game. It's such a quality release that I forget that it's so abnormal for games to run this well. I've noticed a few bugs, only one of which really put me off but I figured out how to get around, and these bugs are nothing compared to how insanely complex the game is. I noticed the game is only on 1.06, so not too many patches. Incredible.  Performance: Another surprise. I'm by no means an enthusiast. I'd rather run the game really well than turn up the graphics settings, as long as I can run at my native resolution. Just for laughs I tried the game on max settings and was very surprised to see a solid 60 FPS for a very long time. Now that I'm several hours into the game I've noticed the occasional dip to 45, but the game does remarkably well at holding a steady FPS even when it does dip, so that you don't notice for very long. Despite my preference for performance over looks, I still kept it at max settings because of how well it runs. My specs are good but definitely not top of the line:  i5-4670 (4 cores, 3.4 GHz) 8 GB RAM GeForce 770 GTX Samsung 850 EVO 500 GB SSD  And I'm running this game at 1920x1080 at 60 FPS.  Gameplay: Here I probably can't say anything that hasn't been said, but I do want to point out how amazed I am by the complexity of the game, yet how well-designed it all is. The main gripe I have with it is that it doesn't do a very good job of teaching the player the game mechanics, but I don't feel bad for asking my friend for help or googling for help...it doesn't detract from the experience.  I'm also very impressed with the AI. It's not necessarily 'smart' in the traditional sense, but it seems more complicated than most AI. I'm always surprised by how big of a path enemies have. They wander. They don't always follow a predictable path. Then again, they're deaf (but if they weren't I'd never beat a mission). It took me awhile to get used to the AI and how to consistently stealth around, and I found this a lot harder toward the beginning of the game with worse equipment, especially.  The worst thing about the gameplay is I occasionally get very frustrated with a mission. This is pretty subjective so I can't really fault the game for it, but you can easily set yourself up for failure on a mission by picking the wrong loadout.  Other frustrations include how much time I spend waiting. I really don't like how long I wait once a helicopter has picked me up before I get where I'm going. This is in the realm of 30 seconds, but you do it often, and it adds up.  And then, of course, between every mission you see Hideo Kojima's name. It sort of breaks the immersion but mostly because I don't think I've seen credits repeated so often in any other game. For all I know it references the earlier games (again, I haven't played the series) but without knowing anything else, I'm inclined to believe the dude has quite the ego. Not that it's not well-deserved!  Story: I'm 35 hours into this game as of now. I apparently have quite a bit left. As a newcomer to the series I don't really understand the backstory and I'm sure I've missed a lot because of it, but thankfully the characters in the story are going 'huh?' at the same times I am, so I feel good about not understanding, at least.  tl;dr  Pros: - Very few bugs despite being a very complicated game - Great performance on mid-high tier PC - Excellent level / world design - Compelling enemy AI - Packed with unique content. Your dollar goes a long way. - Optional mission replayability  Cons: - Long, repetitive animation sequences (mostly helicopter-related) - Occasional frustration with missions where a certain approach feels unfair (YMMV - Maybe I just suck)",

After near 200 hours completion, i must admit, this game feel empty near finale. And that because one final chapter was cut from development cycle.  The repeated mission, was actually useful.  I've stopped playing at chapter 2 because of that, but after some time, i'm back. And now i understand what is the developer's true intention. Because the story is weak, this kind gameplay was forcibly made.  Still, i had a blast with this game.   UPDATE : Beyond my expectations, this game runs well at my old laptop with nearly minimum specs ( with the lowest setting ) amd a8 up to 2.6 GHz ( weak ) dual hd 7640 g + 7470 m 1GB ( weak ) ram 8 gb ( dual slot ) win 7 x64 ( ram allocation was not as good as win 10 )  but it runs well at 27 - 30 FPS, which is playable  A MASTERPIECE, FOR EVERY GAMERS OUT THERE ( ESPECIALLY THAT LOVES ANIME AT MOST )",

Never in all my life have I wanted to rip off my ears with pliars, but this game (and the rest of the MGS series) is so poorly written I couldn't help but contemplate sensory suicide.  Honestly, you should only buy this game for the fun replay value. Using fultons to send manned tanks into the sky is hilarious. Actually, using fultons on anything is hilarious AND rewarding because you get to use everything you attach to the fulton. You also get to customize and command a military base which - let's be honest gentlemen - is an amazing power fantasy fufillment.  Though the gameplay is fun, it can be frustrating at times. With mouse and keyboard I find that every movement Big Boss makes is a commitment. I understand that this is a stealth game - and every movement is supposed to be something premeditated - but considering some missions require that you blow the flesh off of mutant alien zombies with rock armor, I'd like to think that the feel of the game would be more fluid. But aside from Big Boss having issues with something as simple as walking, the game feels fine and works. However, getting caught because you accidentally stood up while trying to crawl over a rock can really get on my nerves.  I should also mention that the game does get repetitive at times. But honestly - what game doesn't get repetitive at some point? The key to making the game not repetitive is to step away from the computer every now and then and get some fresh air. Then, after a hard day's work, come back and fulton the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything while wearing an eye patch and smoking a ♥♥♥♥ing cigar.  PROS: - Great graphics - Fun gameplay - Fultons - Power fantasy fufillment - Fultons  CONS: - Horrible story - Horrible dialogue - Poorly written characters - Could have had more fultons - Controls could have been more reliable  SCORE: Strong 6/10, wait for a sale.",

The positives:  - The storyline is epic, although sometimes it might feel a bit watered out if you go on a side-op binge, but as soon as you start digging into the main missions again you get rewarded by a great storyline with amazing cutscenes and dialouge. - The game manage to balance the line between sandbox and storyline - You can choose if you want to go stealthy or guns blazin depending on situation and mood - The sandboxesque setup of the game makes it both a great and immersive experience when you are in the mood for that, while also being a perfect game for a quick fix of action  The negatives: - You are forced to deal with your FOB base quite excessively even if you don't want to - I get it, you want us to get into it, but I don't enjoy being forced to go through tutorials for something that I don't always want to invest time in. - Some management issues of mother base gets extremely tedious (like dealing with a certain outbreak)",

Final story mission is also a joke, you'll know what I mean when you get there. This game could have been so much more.  That being said, you will definitely get your money's worth out of this. It's extremely fun. The gameplay is superb and aside from a lack of end game content, it is extremely well made. I never once had a crash despite leaving it open for hours. Which brings me to my next point.  The development projects in single player mode take real time to complete. So you could be expanding one of your platforms and it will take 2 hours of real time WHILE in the game for it to complete. This seemed excessive to me and a way for them to artificially lengthen the game. This led me to leave the game open overnight or when I go to work. I probably have at least 30 hours of leaving this game open while not even playing it.  A lot of the side ops start to become rather repetitive as well, but it's really only a minor nuisance and you aren't forced to do them anyway. I bought it on sale, but it's easily worth full price. Still better than most newer games out there despite its shortcomings. I'm hoping they have an expansion in the future, but I won't hold my breath.  ",

Despite the overblown controversy about the cut content and a very short Chapter 2, the gameplay is leagues above any other stealth game (the amount of ways to do every mission is infinite), and to those that say that it's repititive, it depends on how you play it, as in you can make it as exciting or as boring as you want. Story wise, this game has alot less story than the other Metal Gear Solid games (Kojima wanted less cutscenes and shorter cutscenes because everyone complained about them in Metal Gear Solid 4 and Metal Gear Solid 3). However if you haven't played the other Metal Gear Solid games, the story is really good by itself.",

I own the Legacy Collection on PS3 as well as Twin Snakes on Gamecube and MGS3:3D on the 3DS. My love for the series largely stems from the story. MGS3 Snake Eater is perhaps my favorite in the series followed closely by Twin Snakes. It was the story in those games that captivated me. Yes I am one of those people who enjoyed the longer exposition and cutscenes.  MGSV has left me a little wanting. Don't get me wrong. I am enjoying my time with MGSV. Where MGSV excels is in its smart game design. Its the gameplay that keeps me coming back. The missions are open ended and dynamic with the ability to approach them as you see fit. You can go silent or loud and never feel penalized for it. While many open world games populate the map with busy work and things to collect; everything in MGSV has a purpose. Collecting fuel, metal, biological material, etc all helps to aid in development of new weapons and items. The soldiers you come across at various outposts become a form of resource themselves and can be extracted using a fulton balloon to expand your forces.   MGSV's buddy system also gives you a number of different options for completing your missions. D-dog gives you greater situational awareness and can even learn how to knife enemies. D-Horse allows for faster travel between points. D-walker can provide some extra firepower and mobility. And of course the controversial Quiet provides recon and overwatch support. Speaking of Quiet; yes the explanation for her attire is rather silly.   If you have never played a Metal Gear game you may feel a bit lost jumping in. However the game offers cassette tapes you can play which give greater context to what's going on. Even without a good grasp of the story the gameplay is the main attraction here. One of the other quibbles I have is that the change in voice actor to Kiefer Sutherland doesn't feel significant enough to justify it. There are very few lines of dialogue actually spoken by Sutherland even when Big Boss is being addressed.  Despite all of the controversy surrounding Konami/Kojima leading up to the game's release; I am pleased to say that MGSV is still a very fine game. Whats more it is one of the best PC ports in recent memory. The game has been well optimized and runs at a solid 60 fps. As the last Kojima helmed Metal Gear (perhaps the last Metal Gear period) MGSV is a bittersweet ending to one of my favorite series.",

MGS:V takes shooter with good controls and relatively serious story, and filters it through the franchise's traditional goofiness.

            "review_text": "A must play for Metal Gear Solid fans. The gameplay has improved in every single way from MGS4. Just to clearify, this game is a prequel. It takes place after the events of Peace Walker and Ground Zeros. The name of the game is development. As Big Boss you're the head of a group of mercenaries known as Diamond Dogs. Your objective is to build up your private army, develop weapons and all sorts of cool tech, expand your motherbase, and acquire resources so you'll have the strength to take revenge on a certain evil organization known as Cipher that effectively ruined Big Boss and his men's lives after the events of MGSV Ground Zeros (You may want to play that game first before you play this one so you'll understand what's going on in the beginning).   Pros: -Open World (Although a lot of locations get reused during missions)  -Dozens of hours worth of open world side ops missions.   -Lots of weapons/items to develop and customize (both lethal and non lethal weapons/items)  -Great characters, voice acting, dialogue ect.  -Great music selection from hit 1980s tracks as well as classic metal gear solid themes such as the Peace Walker theme during the mission sortie menu. (Never actually heard the main theme, 'Nuclear', play in the game)  -The game's difficulty scales along with you as you develop more items and weapons (i.e enemies are equipped with more advanced gear as you develop advanced gear for yourself).   -Lots of fanservice (Jiggle physics, girls in bikinis etc.)  -Amazing graphics. The lighting, character models, environments, special effects are all top knotch. If you're looking for a true next gen game look no further. Runs beautifully at 1080p @60fps on Ultra for someone with a mid-high tier pc.  -Gives the player lots of options on how to tackle a mission i.e kill everyone or use stealth to outsmart and capture your enemies resources and soldiers. This is a stealth game so you are rewarded more for using stealth as apposed to not doing so i.e Higher Rank, more GMP, more heroism etc.   -You have buddies with all sorts of unique abilities to take with you on missions. You don't have to go solo if you don't want to and you don't get penalized for doing missions with a buddy.   Cons -No anti-aliasing options. The game uses FXAA automatically for anti-aliasing and it leaves things outlines slightly pixilated although its a minor issue.   -The game feels unfinished storywise due to the whole drama between Konami and Hideo Kojima. There's two chapters in the game. The first is amazing with great story missions and an epic boss battle at the end. The second has some story but it doesn't seem to go anywhere and ends kind of abruptly.   -Lots of padding to make the game longer i.e repetative side missions and the items you develop take real time to develop. For instance, if you want to develop a certain high tier gun, it takes 2 hours of real world time to develop while the game itself is running. The higher the tier of the weapon, the longer it takes to develop (from instantly to up to 2.5 hours).  -Online play is lacking. It's basically running around other players motherbases stealing their resources/staff. (still waiting for MGS Online to be released on PC next year.)  Overall this is a great game and I'd recommend everyone to play it. The gameplay is amazing but the story could have been so much better if it wasn't for Konami cutting the budget and firing everyone on Kojima's team including Kojima himself 2/3s into the game's development. Don't get me wrong, the story is excellent and makes sense in reference to everything previously established in the MGS storyline but there just isn't enough of it.",

            "review_text": "A fitting swan song from Kojima in regards to the Metal Gear franchise. One of the best examples of what you can do with an open-world gameplay structure. You can sense Kojima always wanted to make an open-world Metal Gear game but didn't necessarily had the technology or the resources at the time to do it. Peace Walker was the first step in this direction. With the creation of the Fox engine and a bigger budget at his disposal, he was able to fully realize his vision of what an open-world Metal Gear game could be. The result is a sublime gaming experience.  Positives: + Stealth mechanics are one of the best seen in a game. + Brings a lot to the table in terms of an open-world gameplay experience. + The AI is exceptional and surprised me many times. + Superb presentation and polish. + So many number of ways you can approach a mission. The replayability comes when you can go back and do a mission using differen't methods entirely. + Incredible amount tools/weapons/gadgets at your disposal.  + The graphics are phenomenal thanks to the Fox engine.  Negatives:  - Story wasn't as good as the previous Metal Gear games. - Some of the missions can start to get repetitive. This is especially true for the side ops missions. - Second half of the game wasn't as strong and felt incomplete. This is probably due to Kojima being imposed a hard deadline by Konami to wrap it up as they didn't want to fund his game any further. - Not enough variety in the environments.  Despite some faults, TPP is a masterpiece and will be remembered for the intense and memorable gameplay experiences it brought to the open-world genre. It was an awesome journey playing through the game and one I'll never forget, even if the story fell a little bit short. With that said, TPP has to be considered, at least to me, the best tactical stealth game ever made.",

Every game pushes the limit of the system it's made for and in both gameplay and hardware. This game is no different. I bought a ton of games during the Black Friday and Holiday specials that I'm really excited about, but I can't get off of this game. I also don't feel rushed to hurry and complete it. I find myself replaying missions and side ops just to do it differently each time or spend numerous hours just walking around Mother Base looking for items and ... just because I can. I also sometimes just go to an area and move all around the map scouting for talent to build my forces up. I am normally way behind on games because of work and life and the fact that most games I only want to buy when they are on sale, however I am very thankful that I got into this game shortly after the release.

            "review_text": "Every release of a Metal Gear game is an event. You know it’s going to be an expensive project, made over many years by some of the best talent in the industry, almost guaranteed to be timeless. In most ways Metal Gear Solid V delivers. It’s quite different from the other games in the series, and there are some decisions in the game that left me baffled. But the negatives can’t blot out the parts that are simply amazingly good.  I’ve seen sites praise MGS V as “the best stealth game ever”, which is a statement that sits wrong with me. It makes it sound like this is what every other game in the genre has been trying to do, but was unable to until now. This can set you up with the wrong expectations, as it for example doesn’t provide the same white knuckle thrills the Thief series does, because it just isn’t aiming for the same thing.   MGS V is a stealth action hybrid, where either approach works just fine. The series has been nudging in this direction with each installment, with this one being the most accessible to the widest range of play styles. It has the most complex, and the most finely balanced mechanics of any game of this type. Your range of movement, tools and the AI provide for enormous variation and granularity to how missions can play out. At first it feels overwhelming, as there’s just too much to the game for you to master it within a couple hours. This is perfectly appropriate, as MGS V aims at being a huge 50+ hour game.  Because of the length, the pace of the story is slower than the other Metal Gear games. I loved the opening hour, but after that it takes a while before it gains momentum again. I didn’t mind it, but if you’re in it mostly for the story, the pace will drive you up the wall. In order to have a good time here, you really have to be in it for the whole package.  The biggest problem with the game is that the story is unfinished. When you get to the final stretch of the game, holes start appearing. It’s clear Konami wanted to pull the funding of the project, and they had to cut as much content as they could while still delivering something coherent. There’s videos on youtube from the PS4 collectors edition which featured footage of cut content. It’s stuff that would have fit perfectly into the story as it exists now, and only added to it. It wasn’t cut because of a creative decision, it was a business decision. Unlike most games with regrettable endings, it doesn’t feel like it was poorly thought out, only that it has parts cut out of it.   It’s still a story worth experiencing, even with its flaws. There are many high points in the game, even at the end. There was especially one subplot that resolved itself with such power that it kind of blew my mind. On the other hand there are also parts of the story that live up to the “convoluted” reputation Metal Gear games have. This happens mostly when it’s trying to directly tie events of the game with other entries of the series. I see why it has to do it, but it’s clearly more at ease with itself when it’s telling its own story. Taking a step back having finished it, it’s remarkable how coherent it ends up being, given the size.  I vastly prefer a game like this to anything released by EA or Ubisoft, who show only a fraction of the ambition Hideo Kojima’s team do. This game is so packed with layers of mechanics and systems, and touches on so many themes and ideas, that it feels idiotic trying to boil the game down to “is it good” or “is it bad”. There’s so much more to Metal Gear Solid V than your average AAA game, that it justifies all the articles and videos coming out about it. For every bizarre cutscene with the camera shoved right into Quiet’s boobs, there are moments reminding you Kojima Productions also created PT, a game that played with audience expectations like nothing else. It’s the most amazing blend of the abhorrent and sublime. If you think MGS V looks interesting in any way, it’s absolutely worth playing.",

            "review_text": "As a new-comer to the Metal Gear Solid franchise I can say this seems like a good point to start, Only knowing the very broad strokes of the games' stories (The difference between each snake, the time line etc) ensured I wasn't lost too much in the story.  However this game lacks what I consider the two most important 'P's in game development. Polish and Passion.  While gorgeous looking alot of the world geometry proves difficult to navigate. Being repeatedly pushed back (while trying to climb a one foot high ledge or rock) with the animation of trying to climb a too steep incline and yet one step to the right, next to the rock or ledge we can climb with ease. Big Boss outright refusing to crawl over a pile of bricks or small half a foot high wall, the box flying off you if you trip down a ledge (sometimes leading to an alert) to then cover you as you land preventing a quick reaction. These would be a few example of the things that most often got me killed whilst fleeing or infiltrating and are as well an example of lack in polish.  The save corrupting bug by bringing Quiet with you on certain missions on launch, (something so basic and severe should have been found in QA testing) the difficulty of controlling D-Walker, the pointlessness of D-horse and D-walker due to how much better D-Dog and Quiet are to bring with you. Most of the story being in cassette tapes rather than cutscenes or 'Codec Calls' no doubt intended to be listened to whilst infiltrating however if you trigger reflex mode whilst listening to a tape the dialogue will be slowed down making it intelegible, and if you trigger an alert needless to say you won't be paying much attention to it, thus missing most of the story. So you end up listening to it in the helicopter all the time staring at nothing.  The beginning of almost EVERY mission by dropping in by helicopter with credits as to who is in the mission including sometimes story spoilers, Pequod deciding to give you a tour of the place if you tell him to land in a high danger area as oposed to his direct method in a low danger area. The game having only one boss fight which is in itself not that climactic and even the ending being underwhelming, although touching.   These are a few examples (without spoilers) as to the lack of passion and polish, it seems and feels as though they lost interest in the game they were making half way through, however the controls are solid, the enemies and mechanics concistant, I haven't encountered any serious problem with the game itself (other than the quirkiness of the box/geometry) the gameplay itself is enjoyable throughout the whole game and lends itself well to some absent minded grinding or side-ops while multi tasking.  The game is overall enjoyable however with all the hype around it I expected something much much better, and I had what I considered low expectations because I assumed I'd be disapointed by not getting references. While it's good to play, apart from the helicopter part which I mean... Come on couldn't I just press A to get out of the loading screen and move right away instead of waiting another two minutes?... Other than that it's pleasant overall and even that didn't bother me much until I had beaten the game as Kazuhira gives you a bit of briefing during that time for actual missions.  This is a good choice if like me you want a game to grab randomly after beating it once and just overall busy your hands with absent minded gameplay while watching something on another monitor or waiting for time to pass. However lower your expectations regarding story as it is very lack luster.",

            "review_text": "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is supposed to be the last game in the Metal Gear Solid series and it wouldn't surprise me if it was, considering what happened between Kojima and Konami. That being said, I think you should buy the game. Here's the cons and pros.  Cons -Lack of story. That's right, there's actually a LACK of story in a Metal Gear game. There were supposed to be 3 chapters in the game. Chapter 1 is complete and fun, chapter 2 on the other hand is only about 25% to 50% complete and chapter 3 is no longer in the game (but there's a cutscene that shows a 30% completed ending of the game or at least of a certain arc). Konami tried to fix it by adding in hardcore missions but that's not fooling anyone.  -Repetitive and too simple. The missions, after the first few, start to get a bit repetitive. Go into this village or building, grab some injured/old/lazy S.O.B and extract/kill them. It's easy for the most part, especially with Infiltration Suits, Active Camos, and a bunch of other fancy toys. (Note that using Active camos will restrict mission completion to A ranks and the highest you can go is S ranks. I avoided using camo/sound upgrades for the most part for more of a challenge.) The missions also feel too short in my opinion, granted I didn't do all the secondary objectives in some of the missions.  Pros -Gameplay. The gameplay is great. I thought it was really fun for the most part, regardless of how short some of the missions felt. The stealth can be difficult if you're not careful with how fast you move and your stances. I have a tendency to sprint everywhere because the maps are big and they drop you stupidly far from your main objective and I sometimes sprint into patrols by accident. (Note that I play most of the time with D-Dog or no buddies at all) You can use buddies like D-Horse or D-Walker or vehicles like Jeeps and Tanks to get around faster.  -Graphics and detail. Fox Engine if amazing. The game looks great and the lighting is pretty good. In the first few areas you go to, the villages are well detailed with pots and jugs on walls and guns proped up on tables and anything else you'd expect to find in Afghanistan buildings in 1984. The amount of detail tends to stay decent through out the game, but it starts to dim down after you go to Africa and a few other places in Afghanistan. Africa's buildings tend to feel a bit more empty. A table here, a military table-bed there, a few boxes, stuff like that. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but I feel like it could have been a bit better.  -Online play. Note that this isn't about Metal Gear Online, this is about F.O.Bs. F.O.Bs (Foward Operating Bases) are secondary bases, seperate from your main motherbase, that be be infiltrated by rival PFs (Private Forces) to steal your staff and resources. You assign people to your Security Staff to guard said F.O.Bs. You can change their gear (Armor, weaponry, etc.) by developing stuff ingame. From what I've seen, they automatically just pick out weapons depending on what you assign them and armor. You can set them to clore range (Shotguns), medium range (Assault Rifles and LMGs), and long range (Sniper rifles). You can also mark important positions you want them to guard on your F.O.Bs decks. Secuirty will prioritze patrolling and watching these areas. You can also develope security cameras, camera/gun UAVs, security claymores, and laser tripwires. You can probably figure all this out ingame. If your security detects an intruder, they'll call CP and set off an alarm. You'll receive an alert from your F.O.B or if it's someone you're supporting, you'll get an alert from theirs', too. You can then head to the F.O.B and assist the secuirty staff in hunting down and eliminating the intruder.  I give the game 8/10.   I was tempted to give it a 9/10, but the lack of story is unacceptable in my opinion, especially in a game like Metal Gear Solid.",

I've been playing MGS games ever since Metal Gear Solid 1 on PS1, storyline is the best part of the game, always has been. Very well made, very detailed. Game is mostly about sneaking, but there's lot of firepower so that you can go loud if you want to.  Finally MGS series has driveable vehicles too and open world, not many vehicles tho, but still nice. Another down side, is that story ended too quick, i was around 40% total completion (and i was exploring) when all the sudden story missions ended, i didn't even really realize story ended. Nevertheless, this is an apic and classic game with good graphics, game is well optimized, didn't have a single crash during 70h of gameplay, that's rare nowdays. Run perfectly fine in 1440p Ultra graphics on GTX 980 HoF.  Highly recommended, however once you complete the game .. it gets rather boring, it needs more online features. a simple base invasion is not enough.  How about a function, where you can watch the recording of security cameras? See what enemy was doing in your base and how he got past your defences or how about a manual setup of a base, where you are in control of how and where you place your security stuff, cameras, mines and other stuff.   Coop option would be nice too! However in single player, game is perfect, MGS series has never really been about online gameplay, so i guess it's ok, just saying ... they could take a next step!

            "review_text": "Probably the last Metal Gear Solid, MGS V was for me (a die hard MGS-Fan) the most awaited game the last years. And now, after playing through the Story, I'm left with mixed feelings. It feels like this is the best and the worst MGS game at the same time.  First of all, the FOX Engine must be magic. It's ridiculous how easy it is to get 60 FPS with this kind of visuals, even mid-range Systems should achieve that. Sure, there are better looking games, but often you need high-end stuff to run them this smoothly.  Gameplay-wise, this is one of the best MGS titles, giving the player true freedom how they want to infiltrate the enemy base or handle a situation. You can try to avoid enemies at all or you can knock out enemies one by one, paving a way to your mission goal. Of course, you can also whip out the big guns and raise hell (and the alarm), though you should really think about which approach you should choose. While guns blazing is a less time-consuming method, you can't extract and recruit dead soldiers for your Motherbase. The game rewards you for the time-consuming non-lethal approach, as you can expand your army and thus being able to develop more weapons and tools which you can use in the future. The only things I could complain about is the rather empty spaces between the outposts. You feel pretty safe outside enemy territory as there is no threat on the roads, except for the occasional trucks or 2-man-patrols. What could've made the world a lot more organic would be a third-party (which would even make sense, the Soviets are in Afghanistan because of the Mujahideen and not for Snake). A fight between two factions would make things more alive and could even create openings for infiltration.  Regarding the Story; The story however is sadly an unfinished mess. The little bit of story you get is entertaining but that's the problem, only a little bit. If you have seen all trailers, you have already seen most of the story of MGS V. In addition, most of the characters are bland and/or one-dimensional, especially Ocelot, who always was an oddball in the series. He is not the Ocelot we know from the other games. Considering that there is cut content and it it open-world, no wonder the pacing is off. The earlier games were a lot more linear, which helped the story to progress and building tension until the end. The end here is however totally unexpected and random and doesn't really feel like an end, it's more a climax which should lead to the end (and as we know, there was originally a third chapter planned). I'm not saying the story is bad, the twist at the is quite interesting and is still making me think, but there are still questions left unanswered. Overall it is pretty obvious that the story is everything else then finished (unless that was Kojima's goal, as he once quoted 'I always want to betray fans expectations).  If that is really how this epic series will end, then it is a pretty anti-climatic end. Even though I enjoyed this game, there is still this bitter aftertaste and feel that there should be something more but isn't there, a Phantom Pain.",

            "review_text": "MGSV is a game I'd recommend people to get in a sale, which is something I wasn't expecting to say from a Metal Gear game. The gameplay is great but everything else kinda falls flat.  (detailed review ahead, no spoilers)  The gameplay itself is great, it's the best thing about this game and it's redeeming factor, but the sandbox element doesn't really work to it's advantage. So the game becomes hit and miss. The freedom to inflitrate (or fight) a base from multiple angles works really well, but the exploring and travelling part ends up being dull and lifeless and you'll end up just calling the chopper to travel around. Also you will get really sick of the enemy introductions at the beginning of EVERY mission ruining any element of surprise.  The world itself has no real indication of life at all throughout the map besides birds, solider outposts and the odd travelling truck. There's also pratically zero indoor spaces besides the odd room (usually a building will consist of one room with a lot of reused props)  As example there features both a powerplant and an airport base in the game and it really falls victim to this, I found that places in past games like the Granin Design Bureau in MGS3 feels miles bigger than them due to the indoor spaces.  The story itself isn't gripping at all, If you're expecting a grand revenge story and Big Boss' fall into villiany then this isn't what you'll get.  Plot twists or retcons added for no real reason besides a need for plot twists, characters feel barely present (ocassionally popping in on mandatory cutscenes to say 'HEY REMEMBER I'M HERE!') and interactions are kinda dotted inbetween missions, I had ended up with literally zero motivation to get through it half way through the first chapter. It's worrying when Peacewalker had a more gripping story and gave me more motivation to play through it than MGSV. Also to note: Snake barely says anything about anything at all, besides just ocassionally having a repetition question, things he should have at least some reaction to doesn't get a responce at all from him.   Most of the flaws I feel are connected with the sandbox element, The studio giving up a finely crafted linear approach for a huge sandbox feels like a mistake to me, if it was a more linear experience with open 'arena' areas of infiltration on the major bases, featuring a lot more indoor areas it would have probably succeeded a lot better, as is the opinion I get from Peace Walker &amp; Ground Zeroes. There is also a lot of menu hopping too to do a lot of base orientated things and research, as much as it is disguised as being 'ingame' through the Helicopter &amp; iDroid.  The only blaring problem to me is the lack of Co-op, this game almost seems built to support 2 player sneaking antics.  But the gameplay itself is pretty fun, I'm not going to deny it that. I may have 1001 problems with it but the stealth is pretty much perfect in it and doesn't feel like the AI is cheating you and there's some bonus fun when you unlock gun customisation and things start getting a bit silly. Also the noticably massive cut in the amount of cutscenes is always welcome.   So my thoughts are get it if you really want a good stealth game and/or are an MGS fan, but do wait for it to go on a decent sale first. Fans should expect more of a Sandbox Peace Walker game than anything else.",

            "review_text": "First off: It's a crying shame that the last part of the game is flat out missing because I think I might genuinely have this as my favourite game of all time if it did.  Hideo Kojima is no stranger to making masterpiece works in the medium of video games. Metal Gear Solid 5 falls under that category also. This game runs absurdedly well, the engine looks amazing and despite the location choices, the world looks vibrant and actually colourful when it needs to.  Kojima has shifted a great deal of exposition into the casette tapes section rather than having his standard absurd dumping of expositiory dialogue whenever a cutscene happens. This plays out a lot more like Metal Gear Solid 3 than Metal Gear Solid 4.  My initial thoughts coming in were that I was going to be really disappointed as I really liked pretty much every game in the (Solid) series before this one (the original Metal Gear Solid being my favourite game of all time.) What I was not ready for was... Kojima. I had no idea that what he did was this good. The gameplay is fantastic, the fact that you are entirely free to do whatever the hell you please makes it for me though. It's a sandbox in the truest sense of the word. You can do whatever the hell you please as long as it gets the objective done.  By creating scenarios that no two players will do exactly the same, Metal Gear Solid 5 literally tore up the rulebook for the series. The Fox engine is absurdedly impressive at allowing this and the cutscenes are ridiculous. I know people didn't like the fact that they got rid of David Hayter but Kiefer Sutherland is immaculate in this. You can't compare the two as actors. I, like I'm sure every other fan of the series will always remember David Hayter's Snake fondly (that sounds really bad. Wow.) but what they've done with the talents of Kiefer is insane. Look at some of the making of, it's incredible how much work they put in.  Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a masterpiece despite Konami's best efforts at ruining it for themselves and everyone else.  HIT THE LEVER",

With tons of upgradeable weapons and gear, you can take down every mission the way you want to whether it's stealthily picking off guys one by one or going in loud. The AI is incredibly smart and each encampment is different in how it is set up. So it is very interesting to analyze each one and figure out how to take it down. The story is incredibly compelling even though i didn't finish it, due to PC failures. Each one of the characters is interesting and doing side missions is as rewarding as the main ones. Also, the world mechanics are incredible. For example, you are harder to see in the night time, but night only lasts for so long. Also, if you are spotted by an enemy, they will relentlessly try to find you. Even moving between objectives is incredibly rich with beautiful scenery and enemy outposts. I report that the first Metal Gear 'true' open world game is a HUGE success.   It doesn't matter if you are a fan of stealth or action games, everyone should buy this game because it is truly an amazing open world experience.",

            "review_text": "Alot of fun, works just like the game we all know and love as metal gear players. There are alot of game features that can and will make a difference in the world and missions entriely.   Here are those features:  1. ENEMY PREPARENESS : Enemies will counter your tactics. Too many headshots leads to alot of helmets so you knock out pistols is useless although you can shot the exposed part of the head to knock them out. Kill alot of enemies during high alert resolved in enemies wearing body armor, and riot gear.  2. MOTHER BASE : You do not only have to complete missions will the reasonable amount of skill, you run your own personal HQ. Position soldiers in R&amp;D, medical labs, and even combat units. And you will need grow and Build up you base so you can equip better guns, or make a certian mission easier.  3. REALITICS ENEMIES AND HORRORS OF WAR : You may be the legendary hero, but even they have limits, thats the case when you need to take out enemies quietly or capture them and recruit them into you PMC. Although you may have the support team and buddies backing you up, but it will get in the future nasty if your enemies combat prepareness is at dark red or highest level.   And the AI is good, they don't shoot with god like marksmanship but they can and will hit you if you get to close. On the other hand they suffer recoil like they should if your around 100 to 300 meters. They will use teamwork and throw grenades to lure you out cover, the heavy armor will rush you in force while the weaker ones support fire. Plus snipers can spot you very easily if you are careless in your suroundings giving them a edge in both combat and to counter your acts of sniping and killing enemies from a distance. And do not fight Armored Tanks head on, you will die if you do, be smart.  4. FICTIONAL ENEMIES : Im always about fighting dragons or other nasty fantasy monsters, you got a metal gear as before, and three others nasty villans. The 'Man on Fire' is not to be messed with unless you know his weakness, and a floating boy with a gas mask and werid abilities. And then the dangerous Skulls that can tear you up if your not careful enough.  5. STORY : I won't spoil to much, but is does take place 9 years after the events of 'Ground Zeroes', and Skull Face is the man behide the destrution of the old mother base of the last game 'Peace Walker', the rest well you'll will have to see for yourself.  6. FREEDOM : The game will allow you play the way you want, a kind warrior who fights to helps others even leading enemies to a better path, or a demon killing every possible armed personal. You can free roam to gather supplies or do side ops, and exacute main missions via on gunship, or stationed mission uplinks while on free roam.  7. BUDDIES : I'm mostly a team player, helping others complete difficult missions, or to take out the big bad villan. In this game, you won't have to work alone anymore. Your D-Horse will help you getting into outposts faster, and mostly blocking the road where enemies cars and trucks so you can lead a nasty ambush of your own. DD detects enemies and POWs even if there not in your line of sight, detect land mines and plants, and a wingman in killing, stunning, and fultoning enemy guards. Quiet lends sniper support and can scout out ahead of you for guard posts.  Do get this game if you a fan of metal gear games in general, or to play the way you want so long as a it works for you.  Personal Note: FOB mission can be fun, but due to a lack of an anti-cheat system, you will come across cheaters.",

            "review_text": "Here's the TL;DR review in advance: The journey to the end of a legend is more interesting than the end itself.  It's finally here, folks, KojiPro's last Metal Gear, and presumably the last chapter in the Big Boss saga.  Continuing after the events of MGSV: Ground Zeroes (play it if you can, even if some say it's a demo. It's not.), you play as the 'legendary' mercenary Big Boss in a quest for revenge against those who burned his old PMC outfit into the sea.   Along the way you'll have to rebuild his army using a nifty tool called the Fulton device, which is essentially a balloon (which is then snagged by an aircraft) used to capture enemy soldiers and rescue prisoners, among other things. These can then be incorporated into your army, filling various roles according to their skills.  With this chapter comes a new open sandbox (or 2, actually), presenting to you various ways to complete your mission. The game is also generous with the tools which you may choose, among them including the good old tranquilizer gun, the assault rifle, the sniper rifle etc and also some other non-conventional items e.g a decoy balloon and a cardboard box.  You may also bring buddies into each deployment; at first you'll have a horse which can double as the fastest method to get from point A to B and as a distraction if you use him wisely. Later, you can unlock a dog (or is it a wolf?), a combat mech which can operate autonomously and a certain female sniper with supernatural abilities.  Story missions are presented in episodic order, with credits showing who did what at the start of each. They're nifty at first, but after some time they can be tiresome to look. These credits can potentially spoil the mission for you, especially when 'Guest Starring: Enemy X' shows up, so you might want to look away when they show up.   There's also a new mode called the Forward Operations Base (FOB), where you can invade other players' FOBs and steal their staff and stuff. But this comes with a price though. If you are discovered or if you Fulton away anything, the owner (or his friends supporting him) will be notified and they'll show up, trying their best to shoo you away however they see fit. But the rewards are grand, allowing you to steal some of their best staff and place them in your own private force.  PROS: - freedom of infiltration; be a ghost and stay undetected or go in guns blazing with an attack chopper on your side  - superb gameplay  - high attention to the game's detail. Shot an electric cable? You can actually electrocute people with them. Ordered an enemy to lie face down in a puddle? He'll drown soon enough.  - FOX engine is the best performance-optimized game engine with photo-realistic visuals since GTA V  - silky smooth controls with either KB+M or a gamepad  CONS: - story can be confusing especially if you never played the previous games, which most of them are console-exclusive  - missions can be repetitive after some time. They can be summarized as either 'Eliminate this' or 'Capture that' or 'Rescue that Prisoner', so not much variety there. The ways of how you can do them, however, is the polar opposite.  - development for certain end-game, high ranked items can be very tedious to farm resources for and can take a very long time, even when the timer is in-game. Others can be processed even when you're not playing, but they can take long (up to a week!).  - microtransactions. (Ugh. Seriously Konami?) Comes in the form of MB coins, which allows you to build additional FOBs to place more soldiers in your PF and insta-complete development of items or building structures.  Your mileage may vary: - Plot: A quest for revenge. Let's not get started with the ending. Some important details are also hidden away inside cassette tapes, which you can hear to while you're in the field.  - Music: It feels a bit different compared to those in the previous entries considering the main composer is no longer Harry Gregson-Williams, replaced by Ludvig Forsell. But still good nonetheless.  - Kiefer Sutherland. Some other fans may say he's not as good as David Hayter in voicing Snake, but who knows? Not me.  So that's it, folks, my review of MGSV: TPP. It's one of the most polished games to come out in this decade. Play it!  EDIT 24/12/2015:  Added more substance to the review.  EDIT 4/12/2016: One year later, I'm still playing this, much thanks to Infinite Heaven.  How fun is this game? Fun enough to make me delete my save file twice and play it for the 3rd time through.",

The mission borders. It's an OPEN WORLD GAME for gods sake. I wouldn't be that bothered, but seeing this as a viable and, me thinking, smart decision it's stupid making me supposedly 'abandon' the guy I RESCUED AND WAS ON MY HORSE WITH! Seriously, stop with the borders, it's stupid.  But yeah, apart from that, the game is optimised to a T, has some of the best comabt I've ever seen in the game, as well as the most interactive open world game I've played.

Its a great game, but not without its quirks. First, the checkpoints are evil. Like yes its meant to be a super serious stealth-action experience, but (mild spoilers ahead) making me spend an hour trying to extract Emerich, succeeding in getting him, having a giant robot thing come in I thought 'Okay, I'll call in D-Horse and run away' so I did, but then my MAJOR con of the game comes in. The mission borders. It's an OPEN WORLD GAME for gods sake. I wouldn't be that bothered, but seeing this as a viable and, me thinking, smart decision it's stupid making me supposedly 'abandon' the guy I RESCUED AND WAS ON MY HORSE WITH! Seriously, stop with the borders, it's stupid.  But yeah, apart from that, the game is optimised to a T, has some of the best comabt I've ever seen in the game, as well as the most interactive open world game I've played. A few quirks and bad decisions stop it from being a 10/10.  So my conclusion is an 8.5/10",

            "review_text": "UPDATED 2015/09/08  This game starts with an absolutely gripping intro, but the story doesn't really hold much weight. Graphically, it's it's not bad, but not great. Reminds me of Dark Souls graphics (have you seen the facial hair?). Edit 2: It's much prettier than I first observed. Maybe I got stuck too much on the facial hair. This game is pretty, but the environment (Afghanistan) is very bland. Afghanistan is pretty much like that in real life too, but somehow Mad Max managed to make this type of environment really gorgeous where as MGS didn't quite find the mark.  On to the most important factor for me: gameplay  There's something to be said for this game that I can't quite put my finger on. It really is pretty fantastic in terms of gameplay..   I really have been enjoying trying to take the 'perfect stealth' route with no retries on missions. Of course that rarely plays out as planned (maybe I should plan better?). It's pretty exciting to be deep in enemy territory, having managed to sneak my way through multiple guard posts (usually trying to balloon every guard away in the process) to get to my ultimate objective, only to miss one wandering guard and get spotted coming around a corner a bit too fast.   Before long, all hell has broken loose, I'm forced to detonate the C4 I planted on the anti-air radar and the power box (I try to always be super cautious up to this point as a contingiency plan if things go south). From there, I can either attempt to make an escape, shoot my way out, or one of my favorite methods, calling in an artillery strike followed by a helicopter gunship to give me enough breathing room to rush to my objective prisoner/document/etc. and grab it before booking it away from the battle. Even though the heated battle hurts my rating in the end somewhat - it's supremely satisfying.   Other times, things are much more quiet and it's a proper stealth execution.  In short, Metal Gear Solid V can be nearly anything you want that mixes a little bit of Splinter Cell, Just Cause, Assassin's Creed, and Hitman.  Except the story. The story is awful.   Very deserving of a 9/10 in my book. Docked a point only for the general bland feel of the environment and poor story. Highly recommended.",

Couldn't recommend this enough.  Edit: Although I still recommend the game, some of its flaws are just too great to ignore. If all you care about in a Metal Gear game is the story, then don't really bother with this game. The cutscene lenghts have been drastically reduced and most of them aren't really that pivital to the overall plot of the game. This story didn't need to be told and it comes across as Kojima just made stuff up as he went along. Skullface is an awful, cliched villain with no connection to the rest of the series and a lot of the twists later on in the game make absolutely ZERO sense (no pun intended). What's indeed amazing abou this game is the gameplay. It's incredibly responsive, it looks and feels so natural you might forget you're playing a video game. Aside from a couple of awful missions where you're forced to blow stuff up, the mission variety is pretty decent and the enemy A.I is awesome.  If all you want from a MGS game is a great story, with great characters then don't bother. If you don't care much about the story and want the best stealth gameplay experience around, then this is definitely the game for you.",

            "review_text": "Ok, I admit, the story isn't the best... I also admit that certain aspects (microtransactions...) are less favourable... On the other hand, Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is a superb game. The graphics, despite not being the greatest man has ever seen, look amazing, the sound is well made and the musical score is simply astonishing.  While some AAA games depend entirely on their story, The Phantom Pain is worth it's price even if you left out the many story missions. The game shines in the open world infiltration missions and base customization. Instead of guiding you from one corridor filled with baddies to another corridor filled with baddies, the game gives you some toys, tells you how to make more and better toys and drops you into the open world with only an objective to head for.  When you then approach an enemy outpost, similarily to games like Far Cry, you can either run in guns blazing, rilling enemies and blowing things up, OR you can carefully mark the enemies from afar, sneak in, using a wide variety of stealth technologies ranging from optical camouflage to cardboard boxes and complete the objective without an enemy ever knowing you were there. It's entirely up to you if you want to shoot, stab and explode as many enemies as you can see, or if you strangle them unconscious brom behind to recruit them for your army. Another thing I noticed was the way the game introduces mechanics like a power generator. Instead of suggesting to look for one, the game only tells you what you can do if you find one, leaving me to wonder what other things I have not yet seen. Another great aspect is the control you get over the protagonist. Where games like Splinter Cell have you enter cover via a button, then show you another cover and let you get there by pressing that button again, The Phantom Pain relies more on the choice of crouching or crawling and the gadgets you get to bring along. A cardboard box can be a spontaneous barrier hiding you from enemies and the optical camouflage renders you practically invisible. If you do want to change cover in a more traditional way, there's a button that lets you leap forward onto the ground or into attacking enemies.  While this sounds like a pretty great game so far, there's even more. You get control over Mother Base, your hub area for inbetween missions that you can upgrade, customize and that will store the people and objects you extract during missions. The game is not so much about it's story than you, the player customizing your base to develop new equipment and using that equipment in the field.  So if you're into third person stealth games, Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is the best AAA games have gotten in the last couple of years. As a third person shooter, the game still is acceptable though you'll find the real depth in the stealth mechanics.",

It had exciting missions and plot lines, unfortunately they lacked the 'lead up' to them. It isn't that obvious if You listen to the tapes... for someone who don't however it may all seem 'out of the blue'. Another minus is the ending which left some questions unanswered even with the bonus mission. Second chapter has no Grand finale.   I can't say anything bad, about main missions. Task are diverse and fun and I personally love the harder versions of already accomplished missions that gets unlocked in the second chapter. Those add a nice challenge.  Sideops can get repetetive IF you let them... there are plethora ways how to acomplish task so it's up to You-player to make them different, to experiment with features and various aproaches. If you keep playing them with the same style You will get bored.

And always remember this game was made by Kojima's production, an uncompleted child of Hideo Kojima and his team.  So the game is worth or not? Absolutely yes. Unless you don't mind anything, don't buy this game if you truly hate Konami.",

            "review_text": "This game is truly a masterpiece.    GAMEPLAY : The game is third-person. You play as one character and use a large variety of weapons, gadgets, and items to infiltrate enemy guard posts and bases in a large overworld. There's also a base-building element for gathering resources that allow you to build new items and gadgets to make life easier.    ATMOSPHERE : The game's presentation is immersive and strong. It's sound effects are crisp and sound amazing. The music is perfect and is almost entirely 80s themed.   STORY : The story will probably be the game's weakest point. For newcomer's to the series, it can be extremely confusing to figure out what's going on, but that applies to most sequels. Even for some fans of the series who only played the numerical games (MGS1, 2, 3, and 4) the game will be confusing because it's story is a continuation of games from outside the main series (Peace Walker, Portable Ops, and Ground Zeroes) only one of which is available on Steam. Sadly, for the most hardcore fans of the series, the story is still kind of weak. The main character not having as many speaking roles in this game as the last games, the lack of cutscenes, and just an odd premise in general make for a weak story. Most of the story is told through cassette tapes that are optional to listen to, but they feel like they take away from the game.   It is worth noting that this game houses some of the most memorable characters that I've seen in video gaming. Big Boss (The main character) is a legendary soldier who has a revenge lust and convulted story. Quiet (Ms. Fan Service) is a completely silent sniper who can hold her own in any situation with the use of her supernatural abilities. Ocelot (Gunslinger Extrordanaire) is a tough leader and intel specialist who is known for his amazing interogation abilities. Skull Face (WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO?) is a villain with no face, no language, and an amazing story. All of these characters are voice perfectly and I fell in love with all of them. I hated when the game was over because I wanted more from these characters.    REPLAYABILITY : The gameplay spans on for countless hours with tons of replayability and many options for creating challenge runs (No reflex, no kills, no tranqs, no fultons etc). As of this review, I have 110 hours in the game and I'm only at 60% completion of the game. I plan on deleting my save and starting over to do challenge runs after I reach 100%. I didn't even finish the story until about 80 hours in.    MULTIPLAYER : Unfortunately, I can't comment on this much at this point because I haven't played it. There's an invasion mechanic that shows you going into an enemy's base to steal their resources, personell, and even nuclear weapons. You have the option to defend against these invasions and capture/kill invaders. There's plans to release a team-based online game called 'Metal Gear Online' in January that looks promising, but there's not much information on it right now. It's assumed that MGO will be similar to the earlier versions of MGO from MGS4 and MGS3.   All around  8/10  The gameplay itself is amazing. The story while meh does let you fall in love with some amazing characters and hate others as stories should. I will hopefully be playing this game for a long time to come, and I hope others enjoy it half as much as I do. This game is an amazing value for the amount of time you will get out of playing it.",

            "review_text": "A good stealth game, but a very poor entry to the Metal Gear franchise. The Phantom Pain feels like a very lazy effort from Kojima in spite of the magnitude of content inside. Its MGS stripped of its charisma and charm, and only shows that Kojima cares more about designing game engines than he does writing compelling titles anymore.  More casual, younger gamers will enjoy it, but die-hard MGS fans will not be satisfied.   On the surface it may seem that the gameplay is top notch, you will get a few hours out of it.. but its hardly an improvement on MGS4. I feel Kojima failed to bring the challenging gameplay of previous games to the open world environment.  The A.I. is not very advanced.. the soldiers' patrol routes feel about as robotic as MGS2, they automatically spot you if you shoot from very far away and there simply isn't much fun to be had with them. When you break it down, the A.I. is about as poorly refined as that seen in Hitman:Absolution. They could have tweaked it in a few areas and given enemies more random/varied responses.  The open world itself is severely lacking in creativity too.. outside a handful of small towns/bases you come across. Various enemy camps have the same copy\\pasted elements, so it won't be long before you develop a 'one size fits all' approach to get through the very repetitive second act.. where you essentially have to repeat earlier missions on higher difficulty levels.  You can opt out of this of course - provided you can find something to do for a few hours while your invisible combat units do side missions for you. Oh and theres also usually an hour waiting time when you buy new weapons, develop features of the motherbase and buy new camouflages. The game feels designed to squeeze as many hours out of your time as possible, despite the tedious things it'll ask you to do. It left me wondering why Kojima didn't just cut the missions down.  So my main issue with this game - its lack of story. Kiefer Sutherland is frustratingly underused, the story is simply very predictable and boring.. and the voice acting from the other actors is not strong. Troy Baker's performance as Ocelot is over the top and inconsistent, the voice acting for Kaz Miller is eye rollingly cheesy. So I found the casette tapes almost torturous to listen to after a while.   Once I got past the mindblowingly good graphics, figured out the A.I. and explored the two maps.. the game felt like a soulless spinoff from the main series, so I don't feel it even deserves a numbered title.   Although i'm sure most stealth/action gamers will enjoy it.. There has been a severe lack of progression in the series' gameplay since MGS3. Colour me disappointed and disenfranchised with who used to be my favourite game designer.",

Not only is it sparcely spread across the game in small chunks of cutscenes and some sort of important missions, it never goes anywhere. Skullface is an underwhelming villain, and the next threat never actually is played out, the game 'ends' before anything happens. The game ends with a repeat of the first mission of the game, no joke.  Gameplay-wise, the game is really well done, it's how I played the game for so long. The missions are repetitive and not that creative, but how Snake controls is superbly fluid. There are some missions that are just bad, such as the first mission and the last two missions of the game. Personally, I think you should stop playing after the end of the first chapter, because the second chapter is just 6 missions and filler missions which are harder chapter 1 missions. The best mission of the game, it seems, was cut out before it was released.  Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an unfinished game. While the gameplay is astounding, many parts of the game are not fully realized and are left to a disappointing ending. If you are just in it for a fun stealth game, you'll probably like it. I did until I got too far into it, pretty much after mission 31 (end of chapter 1). It tells you how there'll be a ton of plot happening, but in the end not much comes of it. All in all, this game could have been much, much better if it was fully released, or released episodically.",

The story(so far) is engaging, and has plenty of twists, turns, and spooks. At one point, I felt myself close to vomiting(although that might have been just the flu) when looking at grotesque bodies. You felt close to tears at the right moments, and through it all, there was a drive pushing me to complete the missions; like it would have been a crime not to. The gameplay however, is where this really shines. Unlike most stealth games, where you have to patiently wait until the guard walks away, or silently crawl past somebody who's back is turned, I found myself thinking through missions, making use of the right gameplay tactics to complete them. At one point, I found myself trapped between two guard patrols. I quickly threw a magazine, distracting one, then crept through where they had just been. At another, I laid down some C4 where I knew a tank would be rolling through. I figured that since there was a truck and another tank behind it, that I'd steal the truck, and drive past the tank. After blasting the first tank, I sneaked over to the truck, only to find my worst nightmares inside its bed. I quickly threw some decoys, activating them in a slow manner, then entered the truck, and quickly drove off. Those are just a few examples of the happy marriage between the gameplay.

This iteration has improved all movement, attack and stealth mechanics, as well as using a non-intrusive UI, updating an old clunky franchise to this day and age, with gorgeous graphics and an excellent optimisation for PC.  Missions can be approached in many differents ways, lethal, non lethal or perfect stealth, and objectives can be achieved differently with each playtrough, within its two huge sandbox maps: Africa and Afghanistan. Please note that this isn't a GTA-style sandbox; the world itself is largely empty between outposts and guard posts, save for the local flora and fauna, and it hasn't brought back the live warzone from MGS4 you'd expect in either Afghanistan or Africa. The wilderness is way more like Red Dead Redemption than GTA, giving you a cowboy feel every time Snake rides his white horse, or hunts with his wolfdog.   And that's what a newcomer to the series will like, but longtime MGS fans will realise immediately the plot isn't as polished as it used to be. Storywise, the whole game falls flat for Metal Gear Fans: The lack of extended, gorgeous, cinematic cutscenes, the abscence of larger than life bosses and a major plot thread left unresolved due to unknown reasons (which would be a MGS staple, if this weren't Kojima's last MGS) might leave you with the eponymous phantom pain till the very end of the game.  That being said, the story is there; it requires a lot of inductive reasoning and interpretation, listening to long bioshock-esque audio tapes, paying attention to character motives, backstories and knowing their fate and development in the future (past) games. It seems Kojima deviated from his standard in-your-face approach from his past games to a 'show, not tell' approach, true to his cinematic ambitions, not shoving exposition down your throat, but letting each player draw their own conclusions regarding each character's ambitions and the expected Big Boss descent into 'villany'.   Now, I can love the gameplay, understand the author's narrative choices, but I can't forgive the fact this MGS's soundtrack is lacking original pieces, and spent too much in licensed songs. Even the highly advertised, excellent 'Sins of the Fathers' has an odd, anticlimiatic placement, that leaves you completely baffled asking yourself what the heck where they thinking.   To sum it up, MGSV is a perfect game, but as a Metal Gear game it has noticeable shortcomings in key areas that a MGS fan might not expect.",

Dialogue is sparse in cut scenes but generous in the form of cassette tapes, which you can listen to while playing the game and performing mission tasks. The AI characters each have unique benefits and challenges and change your playstyle significantly when used.   The gameplay is less linear than previous games in the series, with a new focus on weapons and gadget research that will affect how you approach subsequent missions. You are encouraged to be as lethal or non-lethal as you desire, and can attain the highest possible score in either manner. Story missions are replayable if you feel a need to do them again to try out any new equipment and AI companions that you pick up later in the story.   If you have Ground Zeroes and thus get the Sneaking Suit included, I would suggest not using it as its bonus (silent footsteps) will make the game too easy.",

I skipped out on MGS4 unfortunately because I didnt have a PS3 but that doesnt matter. THIS game is pretty amazing to me. The open world, the missions, the buddies, mother base - all of it in this game is well done and seems pretty solid. I didnt go by the reviews of all the different 'Professional' reviewers because I wanted to try it out for myself. Seems to me that this is the only game ive paid for in awhile thats actually worth the 60 dollar pricetag. If your a fan of metal gear games, get it. If your a fan of action/stealth games, get it. You wont be disappointed.  Pros:  1. Gameplay - Everything is fluid and feels good.  a. Controls are a little weird at first since they have xbox buttons layed out on screen.  2. Graphics - Maaaaaaaan is this game gorgeous. So far Afghanistan is actually pretty - wouldnt recommend going there in the real world so stick to wandering around in the game. It really is astonishing.  3. Cut Scenes - I think its funny that it says 'Created and directed by Hideo Kojima' before and after every mission. But the cutscenes look amazing as well - see graphics.  4. Runs pretty good - optimizedwell. (I have an AMD FX8350 @4.0Ghz with 16Gb Memory and a Sapphire Radeon HD 7950 graphics card. Typically average around 30-55 FPS.)  5. Im glad Hideo Kojima actually got to stay on the project and finish out the series (If its actually finished), instead of bringing in someone who could of possibly ruined it.  6.. The AI in the game is pretty good. Im glad people can see farther away like they dont all need eye surgery.  7. That introduction to the game though...............seriously awesome.  Cons:  1. I would say the controls at first were a little frustrating since I am playing with the mouse and keyboard and it had xbox buttons pop up on the screen. Not a huge gripe - just took a bit to get used to it.  2. I work full time and its hard to get enough time in to get further in it. Oh well. Being an adult sucks.   Overview:  I highly recommend this game. Great stealth, combat, visuals, storytelling, open world, and AI. Im sure im leaving alot out but definitley worth the $60 retail and worth the countless hours im about to sink into it.  Well done Kojima. Well done.",

Besides, it's not like the story was TERRIBLE.  Metal Gear Solid 3 is still my favourite and I'd probably place The Phantom Pain as my second favourite.   ",

While MGSV doesn't have nearly as much dialog as it's predecessors. It brings forth a truly amazing experience through its gameplay and revealing story.  Not only does it answer questions that I had back in the day about the original Metal Gear and Snake's Revenge but it also leaves us with questions about how much the ending made it (MGSV) feel so unfinished.  Now, from what I've experienced first hand, the controls for the game is top notch and responsive. If I wanted to do something I felt no latency at all.  Though the game may have felt a little repetitive near the end, I think MGSV made up for it in the MGO experience and the sheer amount of tasks and unlockables you can do/have in-game.  The soundtrack is amazing, enhancing the dramatic sections quite a lot. The old 80's music you can collect throughout the world is a nice touch and the fact that you can add your own music is genius.  I won't spoil the story for whoever decides to read my review, all I can say is give it a try if you haven't played the game and if you have it and don't like it, give it another chance because this game deserves that much.  Though I feel that it isn't as powerful as the older games, it is truly a masterpiece without a doubt in my mind.",

Taking D-Dog or Quiet into the field and ripping the enemy a new one is so pleasing. This is a game with truly SOLID mechanics. I mean really, if there's one series whose player movement and control has thankfully improved over each release, it's this one.

I got into the Metal Gear series after Revengeance came out in 2013, and the story in that game blew me away enough so that I wanted to know the story of the rest of the series.

I could understand that the rest of the game doesn't follow that beginning's suit, it probably would take a long time to develop and the $60 price tag wouldn't be enough more than likely. What I will say is that until I became a PC gamer and got Steam I didn't realize how much of a rip off some $60 games were compared to some of the games on Steam for half that. MGS is NOT one of the games where I feel cheated. The game is worth what it asks, and will get even better when Online is out.   This is not a game that I have binged. I have taken my time with it and have played it when I am bored with my main games, it is pretty damn challenging for someone that doesn't play too many action games alike it, nor any MGS game ever. The missions do feel very well planned out, and some deep thought does indeed go into every mission for me. There is no reason why I wouldn't recommend this game, it is definitely a solid 8-8.5.

Also the story was sparse, and because of Konami an entire section was cut out which will most likely be released as DLC in the future. And while all that sounds negative it doesn't change the amount of polish and time went into crafting this game. What's there isn't just good, it's absolutely perfect.

Add in a horse, a dog/wolf, and a sniper, plus a robot walker, and you can have so much fun!.   The story is compelling, and you learn to feel, like, fear, or out right hate every one in the game. Even the enemy soldiers can talk giving you an insight into Their lives and thoughts.  Gameplay is extensive. Your giving a task, and hidden tasks too, and told to complete them as you see fit.   Sound is awesome. Every weapon sounds real, the music is great, and the voice acting top notch, if a little corny at times.   10/10. And remember. In this game, your not like a boss, you ARE the boss. The big boss.",

Moving on from that however, the combat feels vastly improved from what it was. The story was a wild ride, and the missions weren't as repetitive as I thought they would be. Even in the repeated missions they are changed up slightly so they aren't really repetitive. My other main issue would be that the online feature of invading is a bit buggy, and Metal Gear Online has been really bumpy. Also resources for your base feel like a long grind rather than a side mission. I enjoyed the story, but I could tell that pieces were missing, and I felt that there were just not enough boss battles. All in all I would give Metal Gear Solid 5 a 4/5. The game isn't perfect, but it is a really big improvement overall and I am happy where the series has come.

The game gives you hundreds of guns to choose from just so you can do what ever it is you wanna do, kill peeps or don't kill peeps, it's your choice. As an added extra you can call in air support and bombardment strikes on your enemies! How cool is that!? I wasted so much GMP just so I can get the satisfaction of blowing away my enemies. Gameplay is a 10/10. Only issue is that you have to hold down the mouse button to aim, which really blows hard.   Story wise, the game sort of suffers in this department. The story starts out really strong (it has a really good intro, one of the best I've seen) and starts to fall apart at the half way point; this might have been caused by Konamii's problems during 2015. When you get to later missions, around mission 40, the story just 'vanishes' - it felt incomplete. If only konamii didn't have to mess things up, we might have gotten something complete and truly amazing. Overall I give the story a 5/10.   In terms of optimization, this game is truly golden. It runs super smooth at 60fps on my system. I'm rocking a 8350 + 390 and this game is able to get 60fps solid at 4k at high settings! Pretty awesome! Optimization definitely gets a 10/10.  Multiplayer just came out for this game, and it's not what i expected. I tried it out and my god, it is not good. Run and gun is all I saw in the first few matches I've seen. When I pictured MGS online, i pictured stealth and tactics, and slow paced matches. Instead I was treated to bullet fire, and me shooting back. No stealth, just a gun fight. In my first match I literaly spawned in with a guy shooting at me with a minigun from a walker-gear. Then I thought to myself, damn, I thought this was supposed to be all stealthy and shiii. Multiplayer gets a 3/10 for me. Killing people just isn't as satisfying in this game for some odd reason.   Overall, the game is great! If you're looking for a stealth game then get this one. Just take the story for what it is, an incomplete mess due to konamii screwing things up.",

Instead of writing an essay about this i'm going to create a list of Positives and Negatives, I know when you're just looking to see if a game is worth playing you usually don't want to read all that much.  Positives  - The story always seems to be moving forwards and never seems to slow down always introducing new and interesting characters to meet. - The art style is beautiful, the world in general is extremely bright and colourful and everything is outline with more of a red tone than most games, this helps to differentiate its style from the crowd and really makes it a pleasure to view. - The characters are all interesting and I always found myself wanting to learn more about them and their origins. - The relationship between Big Boss and Kaz is great.  Negatives - The relationship between Big Boss and Kaz might turn off some players. - The 'stealth mechanic' is interesting in some areas but it does get rid of some of the tension from certain battles. - The game ends on an extreme cliffhanger - Sound was nothing special.   I would recommend Metal Gear Solid V to most people if only because it is extremely short at this stage, it won't take you long to power through the whole game, however if you don't like cliffhangers you should definitely hold off on playing Metal Gear Solid V",

Also there are multiple bugs in scripting preventing you from doing all tasks (achievement), e.g. guards will get suspicious because they found the bodies... of the prisoners they killed a minute ago... - the beginning of the game is very slow and boring, be prepared for an hour long very bad movie rather than a game - when you complete a campaign, you lose the best companion who will not be available unless you modify game's source code - you are being penalised for non-stealthy lethal playstyle with stupid look of your character",

            "review_text": "Take on meeeeeeeee~. I've had a mixed relationship with this game. Initially I couldn't stand it. You're put into a giant open-world thats practically empty save for a few copy-paste guardposts and three unique good bases to infilitrate. The main missions take place in said random guardposts where you must kill/capture/stalk a person of importance while exposition is explained via Miller. I got bored quickly and even as a MG fan, I left it alone for a while. After coming back, I started to enjoy the game a bit more. Going back and playing missions in a different way in order to S rank them, I got a better grasp of the stealth. With it the game became much more fun. As of now, I see the stealth as wonderful and the gunplay is great to. Although the story is odd, the main missions gameplay is much more fun then any of the side objectives which will send you out to do about 150 menial tasks(save for a few main story related ones). Although repetitive, the game really shines at the FOB infiltrations where difficulty is increased and punishment for being caught is much more serious then in singleplayer.   I loved PP, but its nowhere near as good as any other Metal Gear Game, even Ground Zeroes felt more like its predesscors than this. But, if you look at it as its own thing instead of a Metal Gear entry, its a good game. The visuals are great, the score is fantastic, and the stealth and gunplay are as good as it gets for a first-person style game. There are three big downsides though. The first being that the game decides to uses these mechanics in order to infilitrate the same bases many times to do repetitive tasks that relates to the story because the pre and post briefing given to you by Miller. The second problem being, although I try to not see it as a Metal Gear game, the bosses are ENTIRELY lack luster. Every MG before it (excluding GZ) has had a good number of wonderful bosses, but PP only has two bosses both of which are plain and boring, and four if you want to count the skulls (and if we are, atleast Metal Archae was a good boss mission). Even if I don't view it as a Metal Gear game, the bosses still only exist JUST to exist and are not fun or interseting in any way.    The final mission and final 'boss' might just be the greatest problem. The last mission involves you saving Quiet. The big final battle is nothing more than +10 armored vehicles which you must kill with rockets. Thats it. This wouldn't even be a problem if the game were kept in its original state where there was going to be a third act, and this would not have been the final mission. The third act, 'Kingdom of the Flies' would have involved a second fight with Sahelanthropus. Even if this fight was the same as the first lack luster fight with Sahelanthropus, it would have been a much more fulfilling ending both gameplay and story wise. At the time I write this, its not really known why Konami decided to cut Kingdom of Flies from the game. There is the possibility of it unlocking after all nuclear warheads are dismantled, but this is most likely the nuclear war secret ending that was leaked months ago. Where Kingdom of the Flies future lies is a mystery.    So overall is this a good game? Ehh it depends. I've definetly put a lot of hours into it and I feel as if its one, but its certainly no good Metal Gear Game. If you enjoy open world games or first person shooters and would like to see some stealth added into, this game is great, so I would reccomend it to most all people. But, if you are going into it and buying it sorely because of the name and story of Metal Gear, I feel as if you will be disappointed.",

I'm not suggesting endless save points but every 10mins or so would be great. The lack of saves also prevents me from enjoying a quick drop in game when I have half an hour to spare. Final rant this game was clearly written with the gampad in mind, little or poor supporting documentation for the PC, it is still playable but again can be a pain to find the right key or combination of keys to use on your keyboard and mouse   Therefore I do reccomend the game but be prepared for some frustration and a big commitment on your time",

            "review_text": "GAMEPLAY --------------------------  Gameplay 10/10 IMO  I have never seen a Stealth-Action Game that allows me to do so much with the enemy, the environment and everything else. Motherbase is a nice place to build up. Combat Unit (sending on deployments, playing missions with recruits), R&amp;D progress, everything is amazing. I spend around 60 hours in this game before even heavily focusing on the main story. By that time I was in main mission 15, but I did a lot of side content.   I would call it the most fun and at the same time 'plausible' (I don't like to use the word 'realistic' in games, it's just not accurate) military infiltration simulator.  If you are a Metal Gear fan it's more like MGS3, MGS4 and Peace Walker rather than MGS1 and 2 because it is less urban environments. The narrative structure is a lot like Peace Walker. Story is better and longer than Peace Walker in my opinion but more on that later down the line.   If you are a general Stealth fan let's compare it with Splinter Cell. Way more open, a 360° free approach for 90% of the missions considering the area you get for missions, WAY less urban. It has it's enemy strongholds but it's about 95% exterior locations, so expect no SC style (or Big Shell) gameplay locations in that regard. Obviously we also only have a few locations (like Afghanistan) to move in.  Lots of main missions are similar in objective but very different from story-context and the general feel an atmosphere of it. Especially the dynamic weather and night/day cycle add to the variety in missions, as does the big areas in which they can be set and the scenarios involved.   Side missions are a little bit repetitive. Among the best are the 'Important Side-Ops' which are marked yellow and have Story-important elements, as well as the normal 'Prisoner Rescue', 'Unlucky Dog' and 'Extract Highly Skilled Soldier' missons. On the other hand the 'Mine Clearing', 'Rescue Wandering Mother Base Soldier' and 'Destroy Armor Vehicle Unit' Missions are really boring IMO since they are set in remote locations and often just busy-work. Could have done that one better Koj-Prod.  Boss Battles, despite being unique and interesting from my POV, are far less than in previous games. In my personaly opinion the battles are by lenghts better than anything Peace Walker ever brought to the table, considering most of those were based on Tanks and Armored Vehicles and Choppers, which are only 'normal' enemies in MGSV. The battle with a certain Sniper reminded me a lot of the Sniper Wolf battle in MGS1 or the Crying Wolf Battle in MGS4, though more dynamic and with interesting touches in my opinion. Based on how you play it it can also have similarities with the battle with 'The End'. Some of the other battles re-used enemies (the Skulls) in multiple battles but as far as I can tell they are only the same TYPE of enemy not the exact same. They are a little varied as well since one of them for example is very close quarters in the style of the MGS3 boss battles while another one was a far-distance Sniper battle. Depending on who you take on those missions and what weapons the experience can be vastly difference if you ask me. If worst comes to worst you can however always call a supply drop.  Like I said though - Quality over quantitiy here. In Quality on par with most boss battles in the franchise (though maybe MGS3 still has the best ones), mechanically definitely, story-wise partially. As for the Quantity, way less boss battles.  Non the less a game worth at least 60 - 80 hours for one playthrough, especially with different support buddies to vary, different weapons to use, different approaches to take in every mission and so on. But not ONLY because of that, just to make that clear. You will not have to replay the same mission 20 times to get your moneys worth.  Later on the game feeds you with a lot of main missions you did before and sets them in 'extreme' or 'total stealth' requirements. Please note I do not approve of this since it is only there to stretch the game artificially, but also note that you do not HAVE to play those missions to progress in the story, you can also do side missions and do the ORIGINAL non-copied main missions (missions unlock in blocks, at that time later on I described it normally unlocks 2 old missions to replay under new conditions and 1 original new one) to unlock the final mission. Official mission count is 50, but subtracting the missions that are 'repeat old mission under new conditions' it sums up to be around 40 - 42 missions I think.  STORY --------------------  Story depends on who you ask. For fans - split between brilliant and horrible, based on how you take the ending and how much you expect cutscenes and actual long story content. And how much you like audio tapes.  Personally I'd say 8/10.  A Masterpiece. Yet a flawed masterpiece.  Despite it's (in my eyes) brilliant Metal-Gear esque convoluted and complicated (though maybe a little less complex than MGS2 or MGS4) storyline the game falls a little short in Chapter 2 and comes off as brilliant and very enjoyable yet incomplete. As if something is missing. Without going into spoilers there will be a story-arc that seems like a very big thing and will not show up EVER again in the story.  This is due to the fact that apparently (following the latest news) a whole bunch of missions including 'mission 51' which was supposed to end said storyarc were cut from the game. Even more recent news dug up evidence of a third chapter of the game (Chapter 3: Peace) being cut from the game as well or abandoned in the first place.  My bet is on the conflict between Konami and Kojima. Kojima spend 80 million on the production of the game, and seemed to have it almost finished, needing some more final resources (since all assets were there and parts of the missions already existed it is reasonable to believe all that was missing was cutscene material, voices and maybe a part of the new map (yes, a new map, probably not as big as the existing ones though). So only stuff that doesn't cost that much, mostly it would cost more time). Konami probably didn't want to delay the game further and didn't want to spend any additional cents. Their policy towards the gaming industry is something most of you should know by now, they want to draw back from it and go into the mobile gaming and gambling market. They abandoned most big game franchises which are all still in their legal possession and they fired Kojima and his whole executive developer team by the end of the year (contract ends December).  All that remains is to hope the 'missing pieces' are delivered as DLC in a greedy attempt to get some last money out of the game, considering Metal Gear Online is still in development. I don't know. It's a faint hope, and a pessimistic one at that, considering I would have paid 3 times to have the complete experience of Kojimas final masterpiece, and I would very unwillingly pay it, but I would pay it. Unfortunately I'm emotionally so attached to that franchise.  As for the story-flow. The game is pretty slow in the beginning, after the Intro.(listen to the casette tapes, that is important). Think another prob. is the story is stretched over a lot of gamplay which has to be noted.  All in all the game is still a brilliant masterpiece. It remains though nothing but to wonder what kind of a gigantic and amazing work of art this game could have been would Kojima have had the chance to give it the finishing touches. And believe me, knowing Kojima as a dev over the years I am sure he is the type of developer who would not have stopped until the game would have been finished to his satisfaction.   Still I recommend this game.  Mechanically a masterpiece by whichs' standards future generations of Stealth-Action games will be evaluated.  Story-wise and incomplete but overall wonderful story which has the typical touches of a Metal Gear game",

            "review_text": "I think MGSV was beautifully ported to PC and it is so far the best AAA title port ever compare to other title.  Open world concept was a cool idea that i think has been on kojima mind, as the past series contains lots of cutscene which is one of the element that players was finding lacking in MGSVTPP. A dead open world not as lively as skyrim where there is frequent combat encounter vs outpost in MGSVTPP. I feel they could inculde some civillians in the village but that will be massive work for kojima team to make it like skyrim where the NPC has their own routine and making every building ingame accessible.    Challenge:  I think there is a technical challenge of maintaining the cutscenes, its quality and not beefing up the game size by 5~10gb+ worth of cutscences which players would complaint about the size of the game and how long it takes to download the game. Adding additonal functions also require larger storage space which nobody would like to download a 40~60gb size game due to bandwidth limitation.   In my opinion its a little harsh to bash or fault MGSVTPP due to its open world for one this is the first time an MGS series which feature open world as compare to elder scroll series. When kojima develop the fox engine in mind i think there are alot of things to do such as integrating the tradtional MGS gameplay and feel into the open world without screwing hardcore MGS fan.     Budget:  I think the budget cut cause kojima to replan alot of things as he has a tight deadline and lesser resource to work with leading to the reduce contents vs the traditional MGS franchise series. The FOX engine itself takes 2 years of development which I think is really worth it as everyone is able to run it with ease. These few years the gaming development trend by publisher were always push the unfinished product to the consumer and release day one patch to fix all the game breaking bugs and there is no exception for Konami as well. This is due to the fact that prolong development increase the cost of developing and therefore the game will be more expensive for the consumers so trying to balance between the development duration and the retail price is tricky.   Overall:  I did not regret my purchase as the gmae operate smoothly but nevertheles would like konami to allow mod to be installed for MGSVTPP as this will allow community to develop more contents and missions which will really improve the weak storyline plot and reduced cutscences.",

I actually wasn't very interested in this game but decided to give it a shot since I saw the hype it was getting and I gotta say it was quite worth it. I love the characters in this game, the voice acting, the little bits and acts of humor hidden throughout the game. Hell I love everything about it except the fact that it is way too repetitive. I dislike the fact that when I clear a camp out that they just respawn back in again full force like nothing happened. I mean I understand that's how it's suppose to be otherwise the game will be completely boring. But the sheer repetitive of it and seeing the same area I cleared out just moments ago is just a slight annoyance for me. Of course this can be completely avoided if you aren't a completionist and trying to do every single side ops in the game, but just my two cents.   Other than that I haven't finished the game yet as I just stopped suddenly so I could pick up and play Mad Max and play other games but the story thus far is intriguing. I'm only on mission 40 currently and I'm not gonna spoil much of this but I found it funny how chapter 1 hyped up skullface and making me think he was the actual main important villian. It was just surprisingly pathetic lol.   Customization for the guns are solid and in my opinion a bit in-depth compared to other games, customization for the vehicles though? Not so much. This game also suits a variety of playstyles, if you like being stealth, boom. Like going loud? Equip a giant rocket launcher/noob tube and throw a support chopper to rip them up while you approach on ground. Theirs also a buddy system where you can choose to either bring in a walker (Robot), a dog, a elite sniper, or a horse. The game has a bond system where the more you use their special commands you gain more bond in them unlocking newer features, weapons, and cut scenes which is also nice. I also like the small feature where I can change from playing Big Boss into one of the staff members, it doesn't do much but it's a nice addition since I could finally wear a balaclava. The base development in this game is also pretty linear and simple, upgrade your base so you can recruit/abuct more staff members to expand your development and assistance that you can game while in missions or exploring.   Their's also kind of a online mode called FOB. Essentially a mode where you can invade other players bases and steal their resources and staff members. But their pretty difficult if the player you're invading has fortified his base really well, and when you get caught the enemy player (if he's online) can choose to jump in and assist his staff members from your invasion. That's all I can think of from the top of my head currently but overall this game is great, I doubt I'll go back and play every single MGS game now but it's definitely a interesting and complex story from what I hear.",

            "review_text": "Metal Gear Solid meets Farcry.  Has very fun gameplay and controls better than most Metal Gear Games, especially the clunkier early ones, although the engine seems really flawed comparatively. For instance, reflex mode sacrifices the organic nature of the old gameplay, but playing without it pretty well instantly alerts an entire camp to your whole presence if spotted. This creates a weird difference in difficulty with no middle ground.  The companion system is really nice to have but D-Dog and Quiet are incredibly over powered, as D-Dog marks all enemies and objects in a radius, and you can send quiet into a base and have her clear it without even going in yourself. D-Horse is objectively the best as he has no ability save for moving around the map faster. D-Walker is pretty useless as he functionally works off principals of all the other companions, but executes them really awkwardly. To be specific you can use him like D-Horse to travel fast, use him like D-Dog to mark enemies, and use him like quiet to  try  to clear camps without entering, but he'll probably die, because even with max armor he has no health.  Other gameplay items include customization. You can easily customized the soundtrack, your guns, your logo, your base color, your companions, your clothes, your vehicles, and  you.    Also this is going to be hard to explain if you didn't play Peace Walker, so if you played Peace Walker you spend most of the time in the Phantom Pain developing weapons and items, fultoning soldiers, and being Big Boss.   If you didn't play Peace Walker then I'll explain that you play as an ex-CIA agent   that got duped by the U.S. into killing his old mentor  , but like 20 years after all that. So you're essential a legendary soldier that looks like a drunk pirate who is so respected that he can steal a soldier from anywhere, serving any military, and send them to your oil rig base in the middle of nowhere by having them tied to a balloon and pulled there by a plane.   (that's what Kojima thinks the fulton recovery system is)   In fact, they respect and idolize you so much that they forget about their family and friends to live on your oil rig base in the middle of the ocean and they thank you for beating them up on it.  So that's how you recruit soldiers, which you need for specific units around your base.  Story-wise, the first half of the game is REALLY GOOD. In fact, after you   beat Sahelanthropus   stop playing because it all goes down hill from there. Chapter two is an incredible let down and the story has an ending that, for the bigger picture is really great, but as an ending for the game it sucks. I'll link two videos here that explain it better than I ever could, because I don't want to talk about the ending.  Rocco's Video   Jeremy's Video   The only few problem I have with the game are mostly story based. I didn't like how Kiefer Sutherland didn't talk that much. I didn't like how Ocelot barely did anything. I didn't like Miller. I didn't like Huey. I didn't like Eli. I didn't like how they sexualized quiet ALL THE TIME. I didn't like how you have to watch a cutscene every time you flew into a drop zone. I didn't like the credits at the start of every mission, especially when it spoiled boss fights. I didn't like how linear the Afghanistan map was. I didn't like the lack of face-camo I didn't like how Konami fired Kojima.  Other than that the game is great!",

Graphical Smoothness: 9.5/10: -0.5:I counted maybe two instances where the game would slow down because of graphics, but they were just cutscenes, minor ones at that.  Gameplay Smoothness: 8.5/10: -1: Many instances Snake would start sliding on random pathetically small inclines, and many times a situation would present itself where Snake should be able to climb/drop down from somewhere, but it refuses to happen. -0.5: Vehicles 'door' areas seem to be very picky, and since the Fulton is defaultly on the same key as the action key, trying to get in a vehicle can be a tad bit difficult.  Story: 7/10: I loved the story for the most part, game did a fantastic job of making me care about the characters, the reason I butcher this score however: -1: Forced plot device with severe consquences, I'm sure people know what I am referring to. -1: If certain rumours are to be believed, the proper ending of the game was cut. -1: The game left me wanting so much more, the ending slapped me in the face with a trout, and I really don't want to wait for another full priced game for the rest of the story.  Audio: 10/10: Its all good, nothing buggy or off with it, enough said.  Music: 11/10: Love the Metal Gear music like always. +1 For managing to provoke a reaction with it too.  Online-FOB: 5/10: On the face of it, the idea seems pretty interesting, but there are a lot of problems with it. -1: Grief potential, cause a inflitration totally involves running around with an anti-material rifle and quick scoping the guards. -1: Managment issues, trying to get your good staff off the FOB into Mother Base so they don't get kidnapped just for being there is a nightmare. -1: Mandatory To Participate in, game won't let you get by a certain point without building one. -1: Almost mandatory to be there during an inflitration cause relying on the AIs to stop someone is a bad idea (Because Reflex mode is a thing too). -1 Flawed deterrance system, you are never truely safe should someone decide they want to grief you.   Thoughts: Overall, a fantastic game, would recommend, I just hope that work keeps getting put into it, and that maybe some updates/DLC will add on more to the story for reasons that I do not want to spoil here, yet I'm sure people who have completed the story know what I am probably referring to.",

Reasons I wouldn't want to play this game are.  1. MOD's for single player are limited.  2. I wish I had more control to customize my security teams.  a. Weapons  b. Uniforms  3. Big Boss can spring for hours without becoming fatigued.  4. Weapons can shoot a ton of ammo and not damage.  5. Missions seem easy as;  a. Ememies wont look behind dead spaces.  b. You can kill a soldier and watch as you go behind a dead space and see them say they lost sight of you and carry on.  c. In real life soldiers look behind couches ect...  6. Buddy system is broken there isn't a Boss feel to the game as you are mostly on your own most of the time.  a. Could of added reinforcement mods to feel like you actually captured a base or something.  7. FOB's look like Mother Base they are essentially the same thing. an FOB should be a temp location maybe on land with a fort like appearance ect.  8. Using Robbots is pointless, there really isn't a need to have one as it will make the game seem like you are invinsible.  To highlight I would like to have more control over the custimization of troops and security teams and maybe be able to control them on the field as a commander or a tactition.  Other than the missed opportunities the game is very seemlessly smooth with many missions and objectives giving you a feeling of accomplishment.   I would give this game a 10/10 if it was up to me but since I did become disappointed with the lackof tools to make your men YOUR men. I will mark the game at a 9.5 out of 10.  I would buy this game if I had the oppertunity again it is a unique and fun experiance to have gone threw and will continue to be a game I had a lot of fun playing.

But playing a few of the titles and beating MGS 1 and MGS 2 Sons of Liberty. That I'm in no doubt 100 percent blown away. just from the small hours iv played. This game keeps ya wanting more and more. Another thing i gotta give this game a review for just by itself or it would be a sins not to, Is the optimzation of the game. For a game of the caliber to look like this and run on maxed out 60 fps constent is just a mind blower alone. My pc isn't no slouch by no means but it aint no i7 5960x with 64 gig ram and two titanxs. But its more then over the recommended requirements for this game. And iv played alot of games in this new triple A titles that cant even run at a good fps on more then good enough hardware. So my hats off to these guys. This is a awesome game that i would tell anyone a fan or not to try. If you gotta older pc thats atleast playing some pretty good newer games on decent graphic settings.

However, fans of the traditional Metal Gear formula are going to be disappointed with how the story plays out. The cutscenes that are there generally have great direction, but there are so few of them and so much of the story is told through cassette tapes that you can't help but feel like time/budget constraints may have been a limiting factor here. The same can be said for the ending which, at best, leaves a lot of threads hanging (Kojima still managed to fit in another bait-and-switch in there even if it somewhat obvious). We all expected this game to bridge the story gap between the events of Peace Walker and Metal Gear 1, but unfortunately I don't think it does a great job on that front.   With that said, It's been a long time since I've had this much fun with an open-world game. TPP exists within a bloated genre that's nearly been run into the ground over the years thanks to the likes of Ubisoft and their checklist simulators. This is a game that gives you a lot to do and the appropriate level of context for what you're doing, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is it so refreshing. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who's even remotely interested in TPP. Provided you can look past the story issues, I think you'll find that this is one of the best stealth-action games ever made.   (Quick note on the PC port: it's well optimized and has a ton of graphical options that you can tweak your liking. I'd recommend playing with a controller however as the menus don't have mouse support for some strange reason. I'd also recommend bumping the 'effects' option down to high or lower if you don't have at least a 980. It will tank your framerate in effects-heavy scenes.)",

While the repeating missions, endless filler, and absent third act are almost guaranteed to be caused by executive meddling, the few-and-far-between cutscenes and half-arsed attempt at optional storytelling through your Sony(tm) Walkman(tm) seems more like Kojima was trying to 'push the boundaries' of storytelling rather than resting on his laurels and accepting that you don't need to reinvent the wheel every time.  The gameplay itself is fine and the FOX Engine is amazing; the problem is that 90% of the game is filler and the plot is non-sensical to the point of absurdity. Ultimately, this is a great running simulator and probably the worst Metal Gear Solid game I've played. I would recommend this only for the most hardcore MGS fans and for people to witness the outstanding technical achievment that is the FOX Engine.  I did like Skullface's work with The Who though.  6/10 Hind-Ds.",

The game has a serious tone but there are quirky parts that add some comedy, thanks to Hideo Kojima.   Pros:  - Amazing graphics - Very well optimized to run at 60 fps consistently at full graphics settings - Gameplay is great - Well written characters  Cons:  - The game feels like it is incomplete. - Missions feel a bit repetitive. - Too many lethal weapons and not enough non-lethal ones. - Has the same dialogue for some interactions. ie: Fultoning people, using the support chopper, everything Miller says...  Definitely the worst con is that it is unfinished, it isn't worth the $60 unless they come out with an update for free. Overall, I still enjoyed the game even though it could still use some work.",

            "review_text": "Potentially the most divisive game in the series. My review will focus on the story first (what's always been the meat of the series) and the gameplay last. Both are good, but very different reasons.  The storytelling this time around is focused primarily on cassette tapes... These cassettes are where 80% of the dialogue is. So you won't be seeing a lot of epic cutscenes like in older MGS titles. Are the crazy conspiracies all there? Yes, but what makes this adventure different are paths it decides to take. If you were looking for the MGS title to answer all of your questions, and culminate in Solid Snake taking down Big Boss... you won't find it here. MGSV will leave you with the age old questions, and then some... The character development is pretty good, considering Kojima's source of inspiration for this game. Some necessary reading is the George Orwell novel titled 1984. The entire 2nd chapter of the game is a narrative fever dream... and there are a lot of holes left unfilled. You'll either be fine with this, or absolutely hate it. The most obvious reason most people will jump to is that the game is unfinished, which is true... however Kojima obviously aimed for a theme to the game, and it's a genius theme that a lot of people don't like. Mostly because the plot points, and ending bring you a billion more questions than they do answers. Assuming cut content is not canon, and some of it isn't... we are left to interpret the way things are. Much like MGS2... but quite a bit differently. Obviously Mission 51 was meant to be canon, otherwise they wouldn't have put footage from it on the CE disc for consoles.   Anyways the themes of this game are definitely an echo from MGS2... so if you didn't like the ending of MGS2 at the time, you likely won't enjoy the narrative that this game weaves. However for me, I love the surreality of the entire game. It's a much more ethereal game, made to make you think... instead of hamfisting answers that make no sense, and Deus Ex Machina into everything. I mean that's still there to some extent... but there's a lot of things that leave you guessing.  Gameplay wise this game is pretty different. It contains the mission structure from Peace Walker, however each mission may take you around 30-45 minutes depending on skill, and approach. There are a billion ways to approach ANY main story mission in this game, and that's a feat. You want to lure a bear into an encampment and let the enemy deal with that? Go for it. You want to create a huge explosive distraction, and sneak behind the enemy lines while they're focused on it, yup. You want to sneak in from above, while sniping guard towers to lower their visibility? Yeah. Completely eliminate EVERY soldier from an encampment, sure thing. This game is one of the first few games where I really felt that the whole 'approach any mission the way you want to!' promise is entirely true. I could have gone and hijack a tank to battle the armored vehicle that was approaching, I could have ambushed it with C-4... I could have set up a distraction and snuck up and full toned the whole vehicle along with everyone inside, but instead I blared Final Countdown from my helicopter, while I fought the vehicle on horseback circling behind mountains and periodically firing GROM-I missiles.  For once the concept of 'freedom' is true... and this game is HARD, I've seen many people play it, and they get caught CONSTANTLY, and gunned down. Marking enemies is vital, and sometimes there will be a few that you couldn't see from your vantage point... constantly staying aware of what the enemies are doing, and listening for footsteps, etc.  Anyways I loved this game... it's the best in the series as far as gameplay goes. As far story, well that's another matter entirely and completely up to how you view it. I loved the story, but it's not for everyone.  9/10",

Keyboard users may sometimes found that their movements stacks sometime and the online function (FOB) is good and all but later on does not make any difference at all.  i recommend this game, but if you wanna save money, then don't buy it. because it's no longer a kojima game. it's just konami.",

Story is engaging and in true Kojima fashion, very deep into the rabbit hole. Even the infamous ending(s) are solid. It kept me guessing all the way till the end.  The bad part is that Konami gutted a good part of the story and will litely release it as DLC. Effectively. You could argue that MORE may have been cut. It's easy to understand that Kojima has a LOT of content in his work, and given the fallout at Konami, that could have lead to a shortnened story.  Nevertheless. This game is spectacular. 80+ hours alone spent on story and around half of the side missions. Not including hardmode which can easily add 10 hours.     V HAS COME TO.",

Another big downside was that there were no new missions , just a few , the rest were just 'redo' main missions from chapter 1 but with new difficulties like Extreme, total stealth etc. Basically you replayed the game, i don't know other way to say it. So that's the second big downside.. I don't know what to say...but anyway i still recommend to play it :)",

            "review_text": "I had to delete my original review because it no longer represented my views of the game (TL;DR I mentioned that the act 2 is very bad and that there is a lot of padding in general).  Lets get the basics out of the way. The gameplay is great. Want to go no-lethal, no traces? Go ahead, the AI is pretty good but it does tend to glitch out because I was crouching with a knife pulled on a soldiers throat in broad daylight while his buddy kept running in my direction (there was nothing obscuring the view) and the other guard only spotted us when he got ~10 meters close. This happened only once to me but I have seen it happen a lot on YouTube too, I am mentioning this only because it does not seem to be consistent as you do get spoted from pretty far away most of the time.  EDIT: Actually the AI is terrible, I just assumed it wouldn't be that stupid and never really tested it out, you can be crouched in plain sight in bright daylight and nobody will spot you (spot you as in opening fire) until they get closer than 10 meters.   Now lets say you are starting to get frustrated like I did, sneaking up and executing your perfect plan only to have one of those full body armored ♥♥♥♥s ignoring your hold up and knocking you on your ♥♥♥. At this point I start panicking and the controls not being great don't help either so I just lie on the ground waving my arm as the guard alarms everyone and shotguns me to death. Now missions to tend to get a bit repetitive and when all you do is stealth and things like these happen, well you just want to express some rage. Thats when you restart the mission from your Command Centre or simply call in everything you need while stil on the field (totally viable), select the best protective armor you have, the guns with the best penetration, all your explosives and your tank, now go in that enemy stonghold with your slick gold tank being supported by your golden helicopter playing your jam and unleash the fury (of course you can customize your vehicles how you want, doesn't need to be a golden tank and helicopter for you). Made for some of the best moments in the game.  So yeah overall its a very polished and fun game with little problems like M&amp;K controls and a lot of mundane waiting for crafting items. It also has the PAYDAY2 thing with attachments costing like from ~200.000 to ~500.000 moneys and more, the game treats them as like new weapons but they really are just attachments. Some upgrades are pretty cool though like the stun arm that seems completely useless at start but when upgraded gives you the ability to clear entire outposts by simply charging your arm and releasing lightning on the guards like some ♥♥♥♥ing Raiden straight from MK or Thor himself. Many interesting gadgets and toys like these and you can customize pretty much every aspect of the game from guns to your buddy apearance and vehicles, even Mother Base to some extent. It runs great, and it plays great, more than you can say for a lot of other PC ports these days. If you are not a MGS veteran and if you don't care a lot about the story you will have blast with Phantom Pain. Despite act 2 being pretty much nonexistant being filled with 80% with padding, there will be one mission that will be truly emotional and it requires no previous MGS knowlage. It really was worth it in the end, I never had hesitated so much in a game before, it truly was heartbreaking.  Now for the MGS veterans, its hard to recommend this game without talking about spoilers and why its story isn't as bad as everyone says it is. Also for the fans of MGS series this is more like MGSV: The Audio Book since most of the story and fan service can be found in the cassete tapes to which you can listen any time. This is mostly due to Konami cutting Kojimas funding as we all know. ~~~~~~~~Spoilers bellow~~~~~~~~            So lets talk about the story and the infamous act 2 and some story plot holes. LAST WARNING - MAJOR SPOILERS INCOMING, proceed after finishing the game and if you still feel like the ending was total bs.         You never did play as the legendary Big Boss, or did you? While yes, Venom Snake is his phantom, his double but as Big Boss himself said in the cassete tape he sent to Venom Snake, they both are Big Boss now, their actions and exploits make the legend that is Big Boss.  A lot of people have trouble with the way they just made some random combat medic into Big Boss, claiming that everyone could then just receive the treatment and make MSFs/Diamond Dogs all as capable as Big Boss himself. The problem is also with the weak explenation about how Venom Snake is able to have all the memories of Big Boss. The thing is, the combat medic persona is just an illusion, something to use in the story without completely going nuts and breaking the 4th wall like Deadpool. I mean its pretty obvious that you are the Venom Snake, you create his appearance and give him his name which are actually used in cutscenes. I think what Kojima really wanted with this MGS was not to answer all the questions and fill in the void between Peace Walker and MGS1 but to show that you, the player is the Big Boss, you are the one that made the legend.   Who beat Cobra Unit, Volgin, Shagohod and The Boss in MGS3? Who built a private military force and beat Metal Gear RAXA and Gene in Portable Ops? Who beat Chrysalis, Peace Walker (2x) and Metal Gear ZEKE in Peace Walker? Again, you, the player did it. Why does Big Boss say that you are one of his most trusted lieutenants and that you are one of the best men in MSF? Because he is referring to the player himself, he trust in you the most to carry the title of Big Boss. Why does Venom Snake remembers everything Big Boss does? Because you were there, you played the previous games and you saw it all, you know what happened, thats why you have all of the Big Boss's abilities and skills, thats why it couldn't have been anyone else. Hell, even Miller, Ocelote and Big Boss himself (as Ishmael) say to you, 'Press the crouch button' breaking the 4th wall. And thats why it is also an open world, you are the Big Boss, you complete missions as you please, taking the aproach you want and not neceserily the one that the real Big Boss would find the most efficient.  Also people feel that the Venom Snake reveal ruined the whole quarantine scene. I couldn't disagree more. While it is true that it didn't focus on Big Boss's character development, it really felt powerful because you were the one who recruited those men and women, you were the one who just recently sparred with them on upper deck while having some R&amp;R and now you were the one mercy killing them all while listening to 'a staff member has died'.  In my opinion this game was the biggest fan service Kojima could have given to us, the problem is only that this being probably the last MGS people expected to have the blanks being filled, the story of the legendary Big Boss to be complete once and for all.  Yes, I did not explain all the plot holes, and yes the story isn't anything great but I see where Kojima tried to go with it and it doesn't seem so bad anymore or so incomplete, even though there is a whole act missing.   My opinion has changed so many times about this game but I feel that in the end I can actually recommend it to everyone. While it is not a complete experience simpy because of the cut story elements (just YouTube Mission 51 and you will see what I am talking about) I feel like there is plenty to justify the full price even for MGS veterans.",

Its easy a 8/10 sandbox.  But, its not a Metal Gear Solid game, I think its the worst MGS game from the franquise, story telling is absent with no movies that tell you the story as you advance, Konami (RIP) simplified the great story telling from past MGS games to mediocre cassettes that you have to listen, breaking the game experience.   So far in the game, there have been a couple of 'Wow' moments but not thrilling as those in MGS, MGS3 for example. Boss fights are not interesting, they lack the 'magic' of Raven, Phyco Mantis, Sniper Wolf, etc ... so far not so good IMHO.  As a MGS game i give it a 6/10 ... its really a shame and reflects the situation at Konami, its a shame cause its not likely that we get the finished game any time soon and its a shame that thos awesome Fox Engine will get wasted on a game like PES.",

There are so many different types of weapons equipments and fun gadgets u can play around with. Ultimately the amount of fun u will have in this game is with ur imagination. Stealthing through the game is relatively challenging, though if u want u can just go in with rocket launchers and rifles. Not using stealth seems like a lot more effective in the early game but after a few hours u will quickly see that you still have to use at least a bit of stealth for me at least. The mother base is such a great idea where u can capture people and make them work for you to obtain more equipment. It encourages stunning the enemy rather than killing them. I will admit however, it got slightly repetitive after chapter 1. Which was about 60 hours in for me. I would rate it a 9/10. BUYIT",

This game has a large amount of varied content and a fair amount of depth, some of the side ops feel grindy but are not too grindy where it feels like you have to do them to progress. The game does require you to not just kill everyone in sight as you are going to want to upgrade your equipment once in a while, now although this sounds like a drawback there is something quite enjoyable scanning enemies and then tranquilizing the ones you want to extract before carrying out your plan is somewhat fun opposed to just charging in head on.   The gun play and controls of the game are somewhat hard to get used to but eventually they become very beneficial, something I normally hate in games is 3rd person but in a game like MGS5 this really helps.   When I 1st picked up this game I assumed it would be very stealth based but I have to say going in and just outright killing everyone is an option not one that the game tailors to you early on but the more you get into the game to more it allows you to have fun with dumb gimmicks like D walker.   Another quite amazing thing about the game is the cut scenes, for people who don’t know the Metal Gear Series, it is very cinematic, directed like it is a movie in some cases, this really does succeed as it helps you invest more into the characters and seeing how mother base functions as a unit. I am quite close to beating the main game but I have not completed all the side ops yet or even looked at multiplayer.   I would suggest picking this game up for the price it is at as it is a ♥♥♥♥ing (Metal gear) solid game.  9/10    BOSS?",

I have been playing the metal gear series since my childhood and I still continue to this day. This game has its ups and downs but the pros outweigh the cons in my book.  Pros  - Lots of different ways to do each misssion. - Lots of gear and weapons to develop  - It can run on almost any computer thanks to the Fox engine. - Open world (Night/Day cycle with random weather) - Difficulty depends on your playstyle and is always changing - Game takes around 70-85 hours to complete the main campaign - If your a good planner you will get a higher score but dont always count on it because stuff can go wrong anytime - Nice cutscenes  - You can set up your own song on your helicopter when your being dropped off or picked up. Or you can listen to your personal music ingame which is pretty nice. - You can invade other peoples bases for resources but that is seperate so you dont have to do it. ( I personally dont like it but its up to you.)  Cons - I miss the long cutscenes that they used to have on the old games. - Theirs only 4 bosses in the game and they show up repeatedly. - Story is ok but not as good as the other ones. - Side ops get boring and repitive   Overall the cons dont really bother me that much (execept side ops) so if your looking for game you want to put in alot of hours this is the game. Their is also online but I just want to review the base game since the online is seperate from the game.",

            "review_text": "This is my first foray into the MGS franchise (not counting the Ground Zeroes mini-game that I got for free for preordering this). It's a well done stealth combat game taking place in the shadow of 1980s Cold War battlefields- the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the civil war in Angola. You play the commander of a powerful mercenary company, and go back and forth between open world maps, conducting missions against the Soviets as well as against South African mercenaries, while also foiling the genocidal plans of a rival mercenary unit.  Pros:  1. It's a well done stealth combat game. You have to use the terrain and various tools to infiltrate enemy bases, outposts, and villages, conducting assassinations, sabotage, kidnappings, and theft. 2. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous (and, on occasion, fairly gory).  3. It has an interesting system of having a 'buddy' who assists you in your missions- a dog, a horse, or a scantily-clad sniper lady. 4. In the late game, it adds new elements to make things more interesting, such as 'subsistance' missions, which involve dropping into a hot zone with nothing but the clothes on your back, and having to conduct a mission (you gather weapons and gear from soldiers you encounter during the mission). Another example is 'Total Stealth' missions that require you to never be spotted by an enemy while completing your mission.  Cons:  1. There's some elements of supernatural-type stuff, such as the zombies seen in trailer that Steam's playing as I type this. It was kind of jarring, and distracted from the otherwise fairly realistic feel of the game. I wasn't a fan. 2. The FOB stuff- you are forced to play this largely un-fun, online battle system. Supposedly you can opt out, but if you do, you are unable to access the top tiers of the research technologies. The missions involve infiltrating the bases of other players, fighting the mercenaries in that player's company. and if you succeed, you steal some of their resources and mercenaries (if that player happens to be online, they can choose to assist their mercs in defending against you). It's frustrating to log into the game and find that your troops and resources were stolen while you were offline. We shouldn't be FORCED to play a game we don't want to play, or be punished if we choose to opt out. 3. Grinding. Yeah, you're gonna have to do it. 4. It does get a little repetitive. especially as you rack up side missions in between main missions. 5. The 'Boaster' skill that enemy troops often have... holy F*** I hate it. You have a tool that can scan people and determine their skills and what they'd be suited to do- but the 'Boaster' skill throws off your readings, and you think you're getting a great soldier only to find out... yeah, he's average- at best. 6. Probably shouldn't be #6, but the plot- yeah, don't expect much from it. Just enjoy the killing.  Ok, so I've given more 'cons' than 'pros', but I really like the game- I've put over 120 hours into it as I write this. As a fan of stealth games, I adore this game, although I find myself avoiding missions that involve the supernatural stuff I mentioned in the first Con, above.",

            "review_text": "Spoiler free review!  So I've just finished the game with all missions and all spec ops missions and it took me 100 hours in the game, thats just like my gameplay of skyrim without DLC content which is really impressive.  This game is disputable from its release what is related to the storytelling and cut content of the game. So I decided that I will tell you my opinion on the game just witnout any spoilers for those who haven't finished the story yet.  Ok well - this game is hudge and its just like a flower bud that is blooming all the time you are playing, because of the sandbox style of the game. And I do not mean by sandbox gane that you can crawl in the box across afghanistan desert sand but the fact, that this is just the biggest opportunity to really chose your equipment and way how to progress and suceed. And the more time in the game you spend the more items, eapons buddies you will develop, level up, customise and so on so there is no end to it even with 100 and more hours in the game. This variety of optins and gameplay style can even from repetetive side missions make unique experience every time. So gameplay and player style of progressin is just beyond every game ever developed till this day and that is not just hype, like I said game is blooming the longer you play so there is still adding more and more optins and combinations of progress through the game.  Graphics is also good but I must say - ground zeroes seems to me just pretier that phantom pain.. the rain effects and the dark looked better there but in overal is MGSV PP very beautiful game, no need to get deeper here.  Ok so in therms of game lenght, gameplay and graphics we get very very good game, even the best at some thing at this point. But now there is a story that is not satisfying for many players even the fans of the series, but my personal oppinion is that story is great...a lready know many of you will disagree with me, but I'll try to defend my opinion on this case.Truth, story is not that good like in ALL previous MGS games, but still better than some - like MGS Peace Waker and MGS Portable Ops for example. Story telling fits into the revenge kind of story, that needs some time for mother base and hereos to recover and build it back part to part which fits into this kind of story that is not cutscened in every corner like in MGS4 but it take some time to get things moving. I was sattisfied with lesser cutscenes and more gameplay, because absence of gameplay like in MGS4 was the biggest downfall in the series in my oppinion... gameplay was awesome but the game just wouldn't let you play it and that is not what is happening in this Metal gear solid V so I like it simply more. Even 'the truth' ending was absolutely amazing... that gave sence to the events of the first metal gear game on MSX from year 1987 (or on HD collection MGS series on PS3) - more I will not spoil here of course. The absence of cutscenes is however smartly compesated - CASETTE TAPES OH YEAH! Seems boring to you? Don't worry those are just not boring audio logs like in another games but this is just as qualitiy content as in any MGS4 cutscene, just you can play while listen to them! Thats amazing decision made by Kojima at the expense of hours non playable cucscenes explaining. Who didn't like the storyine of MGSV may not listened to all yellow marked casette tapes, but do not underestimate them, even the white ones are often more amazing to listen to than some custcene in another AAA game title.  Briefly - story fine, ending amazing to me, BUT! - the cut content, of course I know about this and that is the first negative point I will mention there. Kojima was according to some sources spendig too much money and we yet do know if there should be like whole chapter 3 missing or cut of and konami will make another DLC out of it. Because yet we do not know what will happen to the franchise without Kojima I will not make any conclusions here on this one, but what really maters is missing mission 51 that WAS included and cut of. Only some special edition of the game include this mission which is another ending. I was looking on youtube but fact is that is not AS IMPORTANT AS the truth ending but still...yeah not fair from Konami that they released it like this.  So the cut mission and probability that Kojima did not finish the game as he wanted because he spend too much money and Konami habe stoped funding him is the biggest negative in this game in my eyes. there is more cons of course but I do not find them that serious, its really minor mistakes of this game. First - many of player complain about chapter 2 being bad and partly that is true, after the firt ending - that means you finish chapter 1 (REVENGE) starts chapter 2 (RACE) which is not only shorter but have some repetetive content. I presume this was just bad decision making by Konami/Kojima to let you play same missions wih higher difficulty before story ends - this should be more like included AFTER you beat the story missions and then it should have unlock harder missions not before like this because it looks just cheap. Also the mother base is awesome but it lacks usefullness if we are mentionig not development but personal visiting - there is some use but many platforms are worth visiting once and not more in like another 90 hours shame this could have been done more complex maybye and iDroid is more usefull that personal visiting of base.  VERDICT: As you can see I like the ending because it make sense to the events of MG that happens after the story of Phantom Pain, cut mission is shame and the bigges downfall but still... you will spend about 90 hours to get there so it still has extremly high value for a game price. Questionable may by not including of chapter 3 but the fact is that Kojima announced the Phantom pain themes will be REVENGE and RACE - just like the names of two chapters of the game and PEACE theme was in the Peacewalker so if development have started many years before... peace theme may be stolen by Peace walker that was released sooner than MGSV but its just my conclusion nothing official.  Its still great game, awesome game in therms of gameplay, value of this game is hudge (over 100 hrs) beautiful and changing-developing by the way you play it. Because this game have not match in any other stealth/sandobx kind of game that is why it could have be simply 10/10 game.... but the cut content, weaker chapter 2 and not fully obtained potencial of visiting personaly mother base is not leting me to put here perfect verdict.  9/10 it is, but the game will be updated and I hope they will include mission 51 at least. Till then you can punch your crew and let them thank you for that or discover awesomnes of D-Dog paw pads. (oh buddies in this game are so awesome, I have forgot to mention :3)",

            "review_text": "MGS V is a disappointment. Despite its fluid, extremely refined stealth action gameplay it does not live up to expectation built up by fans over the years. If you are expecting an installment in the well-loved tradition of the numbered MGS series 1 to 4, there is a very good chance you will be disappointed.  The story in this game is poorly fleshed out, spread out too thin, and unsatisfying. It feels like a sketch, an idea of a story rather than a fully developed one. It feels strikingly fragmentary and incomplete.  Hideo Kojima's fantastic trailers have created the expectation, the illusion, that this is a very cinematic game, but the opposite is the case. The far and inbetween cutscenes, although beautifully rendered, are almost comical in how cheesy, badly written, and pointless they mostly are. They are cutscenes for the sake of cutscenes.  The characters remain remarkably shallow and static; they are mostly background noise, even Big Boss himself, who rarely even speaks in this game. Beyond the game's great visuals and gameplay gapes a hole of nothing, an absence of the substance we have come to expect from the MGS brand of games.  I cannot give the game a bad review, however, because I did have fun playing it. The super solid, engaging gameplay might justify a good review on its own, as long as you don't mind being let down by the story.  In the end, let's not forget that I'm reviewing a video game here, not a movie or a book which live and die by their plots.  Is this a good video game? Sure, it's great and plenty fun to play. Scouting, sneaking, infiltrating enemy bases is immensely enjoyable in this game, more so than in any other MGS. Is it a good Metal Gear Solid title though? Does it live up to the spirit of the series? Unfortunately not.  If you don't care about the latter, sure, I can recommend this game in good conscience.",

I say worst because it's an unfinished game, literally. The story is choppy, brimming with horrible cliches and excuses for major plot points, and ends with a painstakingly obvious twist which was basically a giant kick to the nads (even if it did make sense story-wise).

            "review_text": "Its here everybody! Part 2 of Hideo Kojima's reimagining of The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. Now I am going to do an IN DEPTH review of this game, and may reference part 1, Ground Zeroes. You can see my in depth review of that game as well.  Story: So this picks up where Ground Zeroes left off, after you saved Billy and Mandy from Grim's Guantanamo-style black site. But Grim stuck a bomb in Mandy's.... well.. you know. Anyway. So they're totally dead now. Hoss Delgato and Johnny Bravo were both on the helicopter with em, but they were wounded pretty bad, and went into a coma for a pretty long time.   Fast forward that long amount of time, you find out how Hoss got that sweet utility arm he uses in the show. It lacks the chainsaw attachment, but the rocket punch more than makes up for it. Anyway he gets up and out of the hospital after being attacked by the literal devil and some floating child who can summon a flaming whale. Its pretty weird. After you get out, you go save Johnny Bravo, ride around on a horse, get Courage the now Psycho Killing Machine Dog. Seriously, this dog wields a knife with his mouth and kills people with it. Lastly you gather up an army to go fight Grim and his spooky scary skeleton unit.  Its a pretty good story, until you get to part II. Then its kind of a ♥♥♥♥ show.  Side Missions: If you remember ground Zeroes, the side missions had you go on an anarchistic rampage on a military base, and also save Kojima's self insert. If you enjoyed that, then you wont be disappointed here.  Kojima puts in missions to blow very expensive military equipment such as Tanks and Helicopters, rescuing violent criminals (thats why theyre called prisoner rescue missions right?), kidnap innocent soldiers and OF COURSE, save Kojima's self insert. And when you save him, he actually has higher skill than Hoss himself. Kojima sure is arrogant.   Gameplay:  Pretty much the same as ground zeroes, except with a much bigger map, Hoss' legendary utility arm, and Courage Manson the Insane Murder Cult Leader Dog. You also have the development of technology in this game where you can spend thousands of dollars understanding the secrets of a cardboard box that you can use to fool enemy with.  But lets not forget the best part about this game. I would like to formally recognize this game as the TOP child beating simulator of 2015. You go to Africa, and there are child soldiers. You often have to extract them, and lethal blows are a no no, but this game cares little about HOW FAR YOU GO as long as its not lethal. You could CQC, Sprint Punch, Electrocute, and Rocket Punch small children in this game to neutralize them. There are many more ways, but these are the main ones that give this game the award of 'Best Child Beating Simulator of 2015'. If you remember my previous review on ground zeroes, Hoss had some clear pent up rage against small children (Billy and Mandy). Kick that into overdrive, and thats Hoss' attitude towards children in this game.  Soundtrack:  They got rid of the Nicola and Bart tribute, so you'd think that this game has less anarchistic views.  You're dead wrong. There a song about you being Nuclear and Wild. So if anything it FURTHER idolizes anarchy.   So overall, the story, childbeating and anarchy give this game the solid rating of 8/10.",

More things to do on mother base, mock battles where the soilders fight back, cards with the soilders, or even building asthetic moral boosting buildings for Mother Base would have done wonders, just more things to do on Mother Base in general besides take showers and look for gems, maybe even have a Peace Day, the moral system is cool but very bare bones. Side ops given by NPCs on Mother Base with a tiny bit of backstory, and run away fast from those rescue prisoner 01 placeholder names. At the least give 'Prisoner 1' a name even, if it's Horney Toad or some such codename, (Also Miller saying that same line every time you take out an Anti-Air radar or find a wondering base soilder has to go. Sometimes silence is the best option MILLER.) Maybe a War Room where Ocelot and Kaz can brief you on your next mission, maybe even decide the fate of POWs like a monarchy where you are the king in Big Bosses Like a boss chair. :P. Mission list are just a bad thing in my opinion especially for a MG game. The lack of boss fights is what keeps me from putting this at the top of my MGS list. I do understand most of the charecters had to survive for the stories sake and adding new ones to kill would get a bit crowded. We get the mist unit but for me a boss fight is good when you really know the person your fighting, MGS has always been the best at this.   As far as the story being unfinished, I don't agree with this. Hands are not held to every answer and imaginations must be used, as with cassette tapes instead of cutscenes. No story breaking loose ends like, 'What happend to Eli?' as far as the MGS 5 story goes he escapes mother base taking Mantis and Sahalanthrapus with him, for all we know Huey and the kids did not fully fix Sahalanthopus. Saying 'Father I don't need you anymore!' in other words, 'Good Bye!' as do few other charecters say as well. I have seen the 'Episode 51' Video and think it would make a great add-on but I would not have wanted to wait another year of development to see it launch with the final game.    In conclusion, Skullface dosn't get enough credit as being one of the best villians in fictional story writing history, let alone in the MGS series. I would really love to debate this with you fine people. Also very few seem to achknoladge the cassette tapes, also pretty amazing providing tons of lore going agianst the text walls open world games and their 'Codexs' or own equevenlents of those is what we've become accumstomed too. The game is for better or worse exactly what you would expect. Personally expecting amazing, this falls on the side of good, but welcome suprises are lacking, such as something you never would of imagianed in the game even after watching all the teaser trailers. (Gwent from Witcher 3 in example.)   9/10  P.S All those people who put 150 hours in the game and are not reccomending it seem to be the type that fall along the lines of never being happy, don't listen to them and play the game. It's truley amazing, see for yourself why they are wrong. :D  P.S.S I have beaten the game plus side ops on the PS4 regarding my play time on PC where I am in the process of playing agian :D.  The spoiler P.S.S.S   Playing as a brand new Snake (Venom) who is already intertwined in the world of MGS is pretty bad ♥♥♥, but it was a shame we are not playing as the real BB. It still is not the end of the world and warrent the games story anything less than a fun plot twist that sparks discussion  ",

            "review_text": "I am a massive fan of the series ever since the broken and badly translated NES-game. The games haven't always been fun to play - the movement has been clunky and camera was horrible in most of the games, but I could forgive all that for the incredibly cheesy story and cast of massive hams. I love melodrama and Kojima does that good.  Now, in this game, 20% of the plot in, I feel maybe the master storyteller has finally lost his touch. There have not been many moments that touched me at all so far. I can't tell if that is because the story is too crazy or too sane compared to earlier games - I am not good judge of that.  While it may disappoint in story and character department (in my opinion, anyway), it delivers in gameplay improvements. In the earlier games I felt like I was just pretending to be a super commando/spy while running in a pipe - now I can actually feel like I have great many options on how to approach missions and how to improvise an escape when poop is being thrown into spinning fanblades. Hell, with the amazing technology they apparently had in the 80's - smartphones, enemy-tracing binoculars, wormhole devices(???) and Diamond Dogs at my back I feel more than a super soldier, I feel like a god descending on the battlefield.  Yeah, the game can be really easy if you want it to be. I haven't tried it but I guess it would be piece of cake to complete most missions just blasting everyone to pieces and, if the going gets too tough, summon your own toughs in a helicopter to explain to the enemy the definition of overkill. I don't mind that - I like to have the option. I like to have all the possible options. I especially like that I can...  LOOT EVERYTHING.  Yes, YES, that is my biggest reason to loving this game. I am massively obsessed looter, thanks to all the Fallouts and Thiefs and others out there. I love looting. If videogames suddenly went away, I would probably have to start robbing stores, any stores, even if they sold just rocks. I need to loot. And this game lets me do it. I loot diamonds, guns, useful materials, blueprints... I loot the guards!! I loot their cars! I loot massive cargo containers! Not even wild animals are safe, up to the sky they go too, carried by a Balloon of Looting.  If you hate reading: Stupid story and characters but great sandbox gameplay and you can loot everything and everyone.",

I think that's a sign of immersion.  - The action is emergent - you really feel like the game reponds to what you do. Even in the most desperate f-up situation, when you're on your back, firing blindly at blurry targets, when in other games you'd be reaching for the reload, you can always seems to find a way out of the mess. It can be hard, but it can also be forgiving.  - Most days I creep around, scoping out enemies, sneaking about, a tranquilizer here, and stab in the neck there. Other days, I take the tank out. If you haven't played it, please don't think it's any 'on rails' sh*t like 'Thief' or 'Call of Duty' - sure - the main story is sequential, but you can p*ss around to your heart's content in the meantime.  - The graphics are suh-weet.  - Miller is Captain Sensible.

            "review_text": "About Welcome to the world of Metal Gear, where the world history took a very weird twist already in 1950s. MGS5 takes place in 1980s, you play as Big Boss, who awakes from a coma after 9 years.  The game fits surprisingly well into the timeline, it closes the whole storyline and finally creates one, solid line of a story. The story is complete, finally. From Metal Gear Solid 3 to Metal Gear Solid 4. The gameplay is very repetitive. It almost feels like the game caught an Assassins Creed syndrome. But it's not that bad at all. It's still one of the best tactical, stealth action games I have ever played. The story is kinda missing from this one. But that was expected because Kojima was very limited towards the end of the game. Second chapter is very unfinished and contains only minority of main missions, rest of the chapters are just recycled mission from chapter 1 which is very sad.  Gameplay Gameplay is very good, responsive and feels just right. Both on the keyboard and a controller. I play my game on the keyboard and I'm more than happy with it. Easy to control and fun to play.  Performance This game literally runs on a cardboard box. My game was played on a 2 years old laptop with 4GB ram, i3 and GT740M. Runs more than good, which surprised me the most. This game is very well optimized.  Is it good for new MGS fans Definitely. You are not losing much by starting with this game, if you plan to play other games. It links to the past and to the future simultaneously. You will learn bits from both timelines and you can get to other games later.  For me this game would be 8/10. Because of q spectacular gameplay, repetitivness and lack of cutscenes and story.",

            "review_text": "MINOR STORY SPOILERS FOLLOW.   “Nine years after the events of MGSV: GROUND ZEROES and the fall of Mother Base, Snake a.k.a. Big Boss, awakens from a nine year coma. The year is 1984. The Cold War serves as the backdrop as nuclear weapons continue to shape a global crisis. Driven by revenge, Snake establishes a new private army and returns to the battlefield in pursuit of the shadow group, XOF.”   You awake in a hospital to Midge Ure’s brilliant cover of David Bowie’s The Man Who Sold the World. You’ve been in a coma for nine years. After overcoming the shock of being out for so long, you look down to see… the area where your left arm once was. Welcome to The Phantom Pain.   This is one of the greatest opening sequences in a video game.   To begin, let me say that I am not a longtime fan of the Metal Gear Solid series. I played through 1-4, PW, and GZ between July and August, so I didn’t watch the series evolve as they were coming out.   That being said, with the rest of the series so fresh in my mind, it’s easy to make a comparison between them and TPP and say this: The Phantom Pain  is not a good Metal Gear game. Is it a good game? Yes. But it by no means feels like a proper Metal Gear.   It suffers from the same problem a lot of games this era suffer from: shallowness. It focuses less on more, rather than more on less, as the previous entries in the series did. It’s an ocean with the depth of a puddle. Metal Gear Solid 1-4 focused on painting beautiful— yet small, worlds, with great, emotional stories. Focused would be my preferred description. Linear? Yes. But by no means is this a bad thing as many would have you believe. Linearity when trying to tell a story in a video game is usually the easiest way to go about weaving a narrative throughout the whole experience.   Because of the choice to go open world, The Phantom Pain couldn’t properly tell a story. Afghanistan and Central Africa are lifeless. The side-missions/side ops are the same cookie-cutter experience every time: save this skilled soldier, eliminate a tank unit, grab a blueprint. Even the main missions began to feel like a grind after a while. The most memorable part of the game’s story was the prologue— a fantastic sequence in which you escape from a hospital. From there, the story goes downhill. The long cutscenes that the series is known for are gone. Many characters are fleshed out via optional cassette tape audio only. Although Sutherland delivered a great performance as Snake, his talent is wasted as he’s mostly is mostly a silent protagonist: a huge contrast from the rest of the series. This game was meant to demonstrate Big Boss’s descent into villainy, but I must have missed that part. On the contrary, Snake seems like a saint: saving child soldiers, dedicating an entire platform of his base to animal conservation, etc. One of the most beautiful sections of the game is a scene in which he pledges to make diamonds from the ashes of his fallen comrades instead of dumping them into the sea. Is this something that a villain would do?   The antagonist, Skull Face, is an interesting character. However, he’s hardly featured and his motives for doing what he did are half-baked ideas that aren’t very convincing.   What disappoints me further is how incomplete the ending feels. There’s no closure at all. Without spoiling anything, they attempted to jam a ton of plot into one mission at the end of Act/Chapter 2 and called it a day. Yes, I know that there was supposed to be a chapter 3 that we didn’t get and may very well not get in the future. It’s unfair to the fans that the swan song for this series (of which I’m a huge fan, MGS 3 is my favorite game of all-time) raises more questions than it answers.   Was it all bad? No. The game is enjoyable— albeit repetitive— to play. I clocked in quite a few hours and am looking forward to the online capabilities. Aside from the grindy-ness, the gameplay is very good. The graphics are incredible, and the optimization is truly one of the best I’ve seen for a PC port in recent times. The voice acting is brilliant for all characters, aside from a few stupid lines (“Such a lust for revenge” comes to mind). The licensed music is a mostly overplayed selection, though they are all good songs, and as always, the original tracks are great. Unfortunately, the polish can’t make up for the shortcomings of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.  VERDICT:    The Phantom Pain left Metal Gear Solid veterans with a phantom pain of their own, and although this wasn’t the best entry in the series— far from it, actually— it’s still a decent title. Between this and Ground Zeroes, I’d say the latter is the better part of Metal Gear Solid V— a more true MGS experience. To someone new to Metal Gear, buy this by all means. But I simply can’t recommend TPP to someone who cares about the series beyond this entry.",

But i have to give it to KOJIMA for the charecter design and directing and the little details they added to the game  There is a part were you can see the main charecters back and sholders while crawling through a hospital look carefully at the back and you will see his muscles moving.. this is the level of detail kojima put into the game so i have to give it a 9/10 in terms of style   The game seems to be huge you can play it for hours if you dont rush through the game.. The stealth and enemy ai are not that great in whatever mode the game is set at on default but its fun to play . the baloon pickups are awesome and the takedowns are cool   The frustrating part about the takedowns is that your normal takedown when you play with a mouse or keyboard only knocks them down and they get back up later. so i shoot them on their head after each takedown.. yo ucan also click once and it wil lgive you multile choices takedown kill or ask questions which is cool but istil lcn t see mto do this properly i think its click once and let go or so am not sure  But altogether its a treat of a game and if you have never played metal gear soliid before this is the best one and the last one so be sure to get it on sale to have a taste of the MGS universe and experience. its worth your while and money..",

I kid, but this does bear some similarity to that title, when it comes to the overall structure of Side Ops and character/equipment development.  Would I recommend this title? Certainly.  I had massive amounts of fun in this game (I played somewhere between 80-100 hours on the PS4 version); I love going into missions with big machine guns and wiping everyone out, I love going into a hot zone with a helicopter and letting all hell break loose, but most of all....I love sneaking around. There are so many weapons and pieces of equipment in the game that you can just do what the ♥♥♥♥ you want. Fly in with Foo Fighters playing. Go nuts. I do wish that there was more to do or see in the open world; something like Mujahideen fighters engaged in warfare with the Soviets. Aside from that, the gameplay is rather rock solid. Oh, I will say that the development timer is pointless.  Just...why?   However, I found it to be one of the weakest stories in a Metal Gear game. The stories have always been kinda convoluted and somewhat silly, but this just took the ♥♥♥♥. The core chunk of the story was...overly sparse and unfocused. A significant some of the main missions could well have been slightly harder Side-Ops. They pushed the narrative forward in no way. The sum of missions that were story were rather unsatisfying. Skull Face was rather underutilised and I didn't get that 'revenge' feel Miller drummed on about - It just wasn't there. This is probably because of the fact that I derived no motivation from Snake. He was pretty soulless in this game.    He didn't care about revenge, so neither did I. The twist ending after the ending that we got was just stupid. It crapped all over the established canon. And was a retcon to fill in a plothole no-one gave a damn about. MGS2 did that meta crap better and actually gave Raiden a god damn personality. I wanted the real conclusion to Metal Gear! REMOVE KIKONGO!!!      The PC port is very (Metal Gear) solid. The menus NEED M/KB support and there could be a few more settings, but overall it's good. I have a mid-high range PC (I play games like BF4 on high 1080p/around 60fps) and this game's specs were hugely inflated. I have the game almost maxed out, and it runs at a consistent 60fps, with very infrequent frame rate drop. Some people are saying their older machines run it fine. It's not the best looking game on the market, but it still looks nice and the Fox Engine is a damn marvel.  All in all, this game will be awesome for newcomers but might be a double-edged sword for die-hard fans. More Metal Gear might be a turn on for some fanboys while the narative might be a turn off for others.",

This ending was EPIC. It involved a long bossfight that was intense and made sense to the story, unlike the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ endings that Konami put together after firing Kojima. We all know that they will release the cut episode 51 as DLC that we will pay 10-20 bucks for, due to Konami being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company pulling shady market techniques. Besides that, the game is OUTSTANDING, it still has GoTY potential and will most likely still earn the title. The GoTY version will probably include episode 51. I can't write too much due to the limitations of steam reviews, but I'll try to compress my review as much as possible. I personally, have never played ANY other MGS game. I thought I would be clueless and the story would make no sense to me. I watched a couple of videos that explained who Big Boss, Kaz, and Ocelot were. Back to the story, CH. 1 was amazing, I felt involved with the story and never left behind. At the end of CH. 1 they show a preview of CH. 2. This is where I was like: 'I bought the right ♥♥♥♥ing game. This looks fantastic.' Chapter 2 was rushed and still delivers. I was very dissapointed with it, but still had fun.

Without revealing too much, I will say that this is one of the best play Metal Gear Solids, no, rather one of the best playing Action games of the generation. This game is oodles of fun, and is stacked with content (people can say many things about this game feeling 'empty', but this is after having spent 70+ hours in the world, more than you can say about other open-world games really) and is generally a really fun sandbox.  The story, something many MGS fans have a deep appreciation for, whether it be ironic or geniune doesn't matter. In this regard MGS V: TPP is a disappointment in my eyes, but to say that a franchise that many people complain was too much a movie and not enough a game is 'too much of a game' this time around is....well, quite odd.  You don't have to be a previous fan of this series to jump into this one. Are there references, throwbacks and details you won't be able to appreciate? Absolutely. But nonetheless, this game is FUN, and you don't care AT ALL about the plot to have fun with it.  Also, it runs really ♥♥♥♥ing smoothly, very well optimized.  Do I have any comment on Multiplayer (which is coming in January for PC) or FOBs? The former isn't out yet (and it honestly doesn't matter, believe me, this game is worth the price of admission for single-player alone) and the latter can provide some fun for competitive types, but is negligible if I'm being honest.  TL;DR - This game is worth it, even if you're not a fan. This game is worth your money.",

You don't have to play the missions in sequence, and what I like most is, there are multiple ways/approach to complete a mission. Go full stealth, or head on rambo style? your choice. If you chose stealth, the day/night cycle will come into play as well in how you infiltrate/exfiltrate the hotzone. Aside from the 'main objective', you can always have something to do. Enjoy the scenery of sunset/sunrise while enjoying your cigar, playing as the Boss who micromanage the staff, collecting blueprints, or even try to grab those sexy glamour model posters! I gotta say though, it really does feel like a boss whenever you meet anyone in Motherbase and they salute you 'Boss!'.  Do you have to play every MGS game to enjoy the game? Not really. Without giving out any spoilers, I do recommend you play MGS:GZ before jumping into MGSV. MGSV is easily the best contender for GOTY.",

It has all the charm of the other metal gear games, but it just has SO MUCH TO DO!  Wanna build a private army on a huge base in the ocean? Done Wanna make an offshore zoo full of animals you save from war? Done Raid outposts, steal literally every thing that you can from it, troops, mortars, anti-air, vehicles, and bring it all back to mother base. Wanna ride a horse, or have a puppy that turns into a kick ♥♥♥ wolf-dog? Done! Seriously D-D is amazing, he's the best radar i've ever had in a game.   I have a Red and black colored helicopter with my own custom ensignia extract me from hotzones as Joy Division's 'Love will tear us apart' plays.

I don't know anything about the Fox engine, but it must be made of fairy tears or something. Just buy it!      My only complaint: The intro credits during the main missions can give away twists that may occur during the mission. Something to keep in mind, maybe keep your eyes closed or something :P.   That is some fancy shooting though, it's pretty good.   Either way, 10/10 highly recommended.   A Hideo Kojima game ;D. (Which the Credits after every mission will be eager to remind you of XD)",

            "review_text": "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain in the ♥♥♥♥  Well, here we go...  It's great! Mostly. Sort of. Maybe.   I'm a little baffled to be honest how so many reviewers felt compelled to label this incoherent drivel a 'masterpiece'. Overall it's tactless, sexist, racist and goes NOWHERE. No thunderous crescendo, no epic boss fight, no resolution at all.  The gameplay? The experience to be had in the wide open world where the game ha syou spend most of your time? Great, varied and rich. Far Cry 2 with toys, to put it crudely. But what toys! So many and even by the games ending there were so many I hadn't taken for a spin. It never stops presenting you with options, limitless freedom to play about in a fun sandbox but one that is thankfully not aimless. You're constantly making decisions to build up Snake's mother base, replacing the one that got blown up in Zeroes. It's all very satisfying in a way that few sandbox experiences manage. Just Cause is another close comparison but it has none of the purpose of MGSV's open world experience.   What really helps too are the intuitive controls (save for the vehicles which are rubbish) and being allowed to improvise, overcoming failures instead of feeling like you really ought to reload a checkpoint. Every single mechanic and idea just meshes together giving you a massive arsenal but one that's never overwhelming. I loved every moment of running around on my horse or calling upon the aid of a trusty sniper, kidnapping soldiers with balloons and blaring 80s music into the faces of my enemies. For the majority of the time playing, Phantom Pain is a pure joy.   But not always. It starts off the bat with an impressive but baffling opening, dropping a hundred questions on your head before sending a Snake awoken from a coma out to Afghanistan on a quest for revengeance. This leads to the natural expectation that you will get answers or explanations to at least a few of the questions and mysteries born here. At least the major ones, right? Nope. Not one. Whilst the MGS games have always been incredibly daft, they've always been structured and paced smartly, excluding those troublesome cutscenes, and build to strong finales.  Not so in the Phantom Pain, where after a loud but disappointing middle act, it simply limps to the finale via several horridly difficult missions and several repeats of older missions for no real reason. 'Chapter Two' it's called, because I assume 'Chapter We're Rushing to Put Something Together, Quick Just Make Them Replay the Same Old ♥♥♥♥' was too long a title.  To rub salt in the wound, all these tiresome replays and frustrating final missions lead to one of the dumbest, most unsatisying endings ever with a reveal that's so pointless and stupid I felt dumber for simply having experienced it. Oh and it's a cliff hanger. In the last MGS game Kojima will ever make. Woo. 'Masterpiece'. Some will say the story 'doesn't matter' but A) That would be fine if the game didn't dedicate so much time to the damned stupidity and B) that's only half the problem. Cause as fun as kidnapping soldiers and running around in a lovely sandbox is, the game just never comes together to form a satisfying whole. It runs out of steam halfway through and never picks up again, leaving us chasing a conclusion that never comes in the hopes of providing some framework to our experiences. It never comes. Perhaps that's what Kojima was trying to tell us with 'The Phantom Pain?'  Although let's not give Kojima too much credit, since he's had enough of that already with his name plastered over every 20 seconds of gameplay. 'Written/Directed by Kojima'...'Starring Kojima'...'Based on melodies once whistled by Kojima.'  I know there's been a falling out with Konami in the background to this game but I don't doubt for a second that has nothing to do with Kojima satisfying his own vanity here. Or his perversions.  A lot of hoo-hah's already been made over the half naked 'character' Quiet (and rightly so!) but I've not got a lot more to add than yes, it's gross. The weirder part though is how it exists in this odd sexless vacuum. Unlike something like The Witcher or Mass Effect which take great pride in its nudity and sex, this game is so devoid of sex, passion or even the faintest whiff of romance, why they bothered to include Quiet at all is baffling. I mean, the mostly likely romantic relationship in the game would be Kaz and Snake, so why introduce Quiet at all when the game still refuses to have our characters do anything but growl over the horrors of war?  So it's pointless as well as tasteless.   And that's not even to mention the racist caricatures or the the tactful inclusion of 'Guest Starring Child Soldiers.'   So at the core, we have an imaginative, rich and deep game that's unparalleled as sandboxes go. The problem is it never becomes anything more, never becomes a journey or experience really worth remembering, unlike the most memorable of recent open world games or hell, obviously, just great games in general.  I began the game with tremendous enthusiasm and laughed and smiled through so much of my time with it but I came away feeling completely hollow. A waste of a great game in the end and somewhere far short of the positivity I've seen heaped upon the game.  I'd happily recommend it to anyone but with the major caveat that it all winds up feeling a bit pointless and cheap. Enjoy the journey whilst it lasts, the destination is not Outer Heaven.",

            "review_text": "MGSV Review  I've been a fan of the Metal Gear series ever since MGS1, where my cousins and I would take turns playing through the, at the time, ground-breaking stealth action game. This series is known for intense gameplay, massive and memorable boss battles, fourth-wall-breaking, quirky humor, and probably most of all, extremely long story-driven cutscenes. Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain delivers on all of these fronts except for the last.   Let me start off by saying that MGSV is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, in every sense of the phrase. It is so jam-packed full of meaningless little details that could easily be missed, but make the experience just a little better for finding them. The cutscenes are epic and cinematography is so well-done, borrowing from and inspired by classic movie tropes and very tasteful art direction. (This statement is for the cutscenes in and of themselves...as far as actual story content is concerned, I'll get to that later.) This game's pacing and sense of progression is super effective; there is always something that pops up to keep the player engaged and from putting the controller down (yes, its much easier to play with a controller IMHO), whether it be a new set of missions of side ops that appear, a slew of new weapons or items available to develop, revelation- and humor-filled cassette tapes to listen to, new highly skilled soldiers just ready for a-Fultoning, or completely unexpected twists in gameplay mechanics that tie in seamlessly with the story (I'm looking at you, Chapter 2...PRO-TIP: make sure you extract as many soldiers as you can in Chapter 1! You'll be better prepared for the turn of events around the halfway mark).   MGSV is beautiful. It looks fantastic and runs smooth as butter. The character models are hyper-realistic, emanating a subtle glow that only games like GTA5 have been able to pull off. I will say that after a while, the environments get a little stale since these locations are all you're going to see and replay over and over again, but the level design for each base and mission is brilliant and fun to play in no matter how many times you revisit each location.  This game is incredibly addicting, and there is one big reason why: gameplay is king. Holy ♥♥♥♥, this is a fun game to play. Everything about the play mechanics just works. It may seem overwhelming at first, with the sheer amount of information and content at your disposal, or the open-ended nature of base infiltration (the core of MGSV's gameplay), but stick with it and learn from your mistakes and before you know it, you'll be having a blast playing this game. This is the ultimate stealth experience: you can literally choose however you want to take on a mission...do you prefer sneaking past everyone and being a complete ghost without leaving a single trace of your presence, or setting up a clever distraction using a mix of C-4, grenades, and decoys that you set off as you skirt around the other way while the enemy is fixated on the explosion, or would you prefer arming yourself to the teeth with grenade launchers, rockets, machine guns, and full-on battle armor and busting in guns-blazing? I personally prefer skirting around the area, marking all the guards I see, and sniping fools from a distance with the awesome silenced tranquilizer sniper, chuckling at the somewhat-exploitable but incredibly smart and adaptive AIstaying just out of sight as they try to find the reason for all their comrades dropping to the ground in sweet, sweet slumber, only calling for Quiet's help (one of four Buddies you can take on missions, and who also becomes overwhelmingly powerful late in the game) if I desperately need it...I've taken down entire bases this way without a single reinforcement being called in, and it's so satisfying every single time. How you play this game really is up to you.   What is really cool in an industry saturated with death and bloodshed is the fact that MGSV encourages non-lethal playstyles. Sure, there is plenty of gore and killing, but underneath a satirical, self-opposing glorification of violence, the game actually rewards players who do not kill and instead rescue or extract enemies. Plus, there are no-kill and complete stealth bonuses for most missions that put that tantalizing S-Rank within reach.   This game rewards creativity and intelligence...it is ridiculously hard without having a plan, but once you figure out what works and successfully execute a well-thought out infiltration plan after several game overs, the sense of accomplishment you get is unparalleled. The more you progress in the game, naturally, the harder it gets, with soldiers donning riot suits and armor, equipping more powerful weapons (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ snipers...), and fighting alongside tough allies that I won't spoil here. There were some missions where I died a lot, but those frustrations paid off when I fixed my mistakes and applied the techniques I'd learned on my own, successfully completing the missions.  Replayability: I just finished the story (including getting the “secret” ending) after about 70 hours, and I still have a ton of things to do. You can replay any mission (and a handful of side ops) to check off all the mission tasks, try to improve your score, unlock bonuses, or even just to extract stronger soldiers, artillery, resources for Mother Base, and vehicles such as armored tanks. The underlying base-building mechanic and staff management system is surprisingly addicting, with the next upgrade or platform just around the corner. The more soldiers you recruit, the higher your platform levels get, improving the rate at which you earn GMP (in-game currency), upgrading your support helicopter to better handle air-support and exfiltration situations, or revealing enemies, prisoners, or useful items in the field before you get there thanks to a good Intel team.  Multiplayer: I've had a few (unsuccessful) experiences with the FOB system, so I can't really comment on this aspect. Metal Gear Online 3 will be releasing next year on the PC, so hopefully that will be a fun addition to this already great game.  The musical score in this game truly captures the mood, from tense, heart-racing moments of cautious infiltration to epic, sweeping arrival points. Very well-done and perfect for this game.   Let's talk about the story. To be honest, I'm a little disappointed with how the game ended. It feels confused, as if Kojima and the writers didn't exactly know how they wanted to tie up all the loose ends, as it left me scratching my head with more questions than answers. Leading up to this segment, however, I feel that the episodic structure of the narrative is much more pleasing than the hour-long cutscenes of previous entries, with players being able to play the game at their own pace...if you'd rather get a stealth-action fix as opposed to sitting through cutscenes, you can replay missions or do some side ops whenever you feel like it, with no restrictions or “points of no return”. Despite the ending, the story is pretty interesting, one of the most memorable moments of which occurs in the Quarantine Zone around mission 40...this part of the game made me question a lot of things, and it was extremely difficult for me to simply aim and fire, something I had been doing the entire game up to this point.  Character development: taking a more gameplay-focused approach, MGSV doesn't really have much time to devote to character development, but what little there is is gripping enough to keep your interest. Characters like Huey, Kaz, and Quiet all have their moments to shine...and despite being obviously over-sexualized, Quiet has one of the more interesting story arcs. If you've played Peace Walker, she's much like Paz in terms of internal conflict. It's fun finding out why these characters do the things they do.  Overall: 10/10. It's not perfect, and the ending kind of sucks, but it's so much fun!",

            "review_text": "So just finished the game from Episode 1 to 46 and i can say that this game is awesome and worth every pennies but however that does not mean that it doesn't have flaws. To make this review short,i will put pros/con below. I like how you can create your own custom character (no spoilers as this is critical to the story in this game)  Pros The game is extremely huge and long (if you wanna just play the story as i did,it's going to be very very long,as you can see in my hours of played session.) Great graphics (the fox engine is very beautiful) Optimized great 60 FPS (although there were a few scenes that was dropping frames a lot) Cutscenes isn't extremely long (now i know that some people might object to this,but i wouldn't want to watch a cutscene that goes on for an hour when this is supposed to be a game that we are supposed to be playing not watching.) Great well done cutscenes (i like how the camera is done so cinematically and it feels realistic as if it is a found footage block buster movie.) Game is so much fun in terms of gameplay (i love how the game is open world which means you can tackle missions in any way you want,you can go in quiet or loud.) Voice acting is AAA quality (kiefer sutherland did a great job on the voice acting of snake) Motherbase management (i just love how you can have your very own motherbase and manage it) Every support buddy is useful in their own ways Lots of weapons High replayablility  Cons Controls are sometimes weird (playing on Mouse and keyboard) There isn't much cutscenes (The game is more favoured in gameplay than other games which is more focused on both gameplay and cutscenes) This game doesn't really gives you the badass feeling of being a big boss as said (but that's just me,it may be different from you.) There is no episode 51 (which is a very important episode to the story,greatly disappointed) FOB PAYWALL of buying another FOB base (Really? you have to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BUY ANOTHER FOB WITH REAL MONEY ONLY!? This is unacceptable,i'm fine with MGO3 if your gonna do microtransaction but FOB really? your gonna milk both multiplayer of us money!? Really disappointed!) Not completed  That's all i can think of,So my final verdict for this game is a 9/10, i absolutely love this game and is so far my favourite game this year so far enjoyed so much that my money in this was worth it. My recommendation is BUY THIS GAME if your into stealth games but people who enjoyed MGS4 which had very long cutscenes may be disappointed with this as this doesn't really have those long cutscenes. Anyways,this game is worth every single penny in terms of gameplay.",

            "review_text": "tl;dr: 9/10 GOTD  Same day patch went out, fixed my issues, game runs great so here's a review. (As of writing I have played for approximately 30 hrs, and left my game running while I slept and did other things resulting 47 hrs on record)  First, the bad. The bad news is that there are some minor glitches including an indoor shading bug that obscures vision, the paint job I wanted on Mother Base was not presented (you only get about ten choices), and there is some occassional weirdness with movement which is the most major concern I have. It's a console port which brings a set of issues, character control and interaction could both use some tighening up, I've lost out on some pretty decent missions because of issues ranging from control lock to control spaz.  The really bad news is that coop is not in it.  The good news is that I'm hypercritical. I haven't really liked, enjoyed, and felt refreshed by a solid blend of writing and gameplay of a game for many years; this game is not just Game of the Decade, so far, this is the best sandbox guerilla experience to date AND the best Metal Gear Solid (although I wouldn't introduce someone to MGS with this game as it doesn't capture the feel of the first or second).  So, it's good, perhaps you would like to know why:  ~ True open world. As close to a 'living world' as we normally see, but perhaps better executed in gameplay terms than similar attempts, nothing revolutionary but well implemented and goes a long way towards keeping the game fresh.  ~ Good sense of immersion, it isn't overdone and it isn't something you glaze at, if you know the story of Big Boss already than you get that feeling of 'this is it, this is what being Big Boss is.' If you don't there is plenty of optional cassete lore to listen to.  ~ Ocelot is well written, they could have easily messed that up, but as it is his almost loving personality fits the psychopathy we see in chronologically latter games.  ~ Gameplay flows fluidly between stealth and action, the gunplay is decent enough, and the difficulty scales to your efforts and failures. If you attempt something difficult it will be difficult, if you fail you will be in a difficult situation, if you play it safe the challenge will be easy to moderate. Time, score, and style encourage you to put the effort in while avoiding failure; although the game is pretty forgiving in general it will punish failure by ramping up the stakes/difficulty at various rates.  ~ Although most serious games manage to come off as fanfiction, come off as clunky, or are just plain long winded this game feels like it was written by someone with both vision and skill who understood both the characters they were working with and the player's role as a protagonist.  ~ Hidden objectives. You're a commando, God damn it, think like one. Look around, analyze the psyche of your enemy, think about how to get the most out of the current mission; you won't be able to get it all in a timely and fun manner, or at all, but if you put in the effort you may be rewarded. Or, if you're a pansy, you could play the mission a second time when all the objectives are revealed post mission.  ~ Customization. Aside from the weapons it isn't the most extensive customization system imaginable, but it meets a status quo far above industry standard, so enjoy being the Big Boss. As for you Konami, enjoy the dust falling on other developers heads, because you are a step above.  ~ Performance is pretty good, even on my worst computer, haven't noticed any freezing or input lag since the patch. That said, it is still a port that was clearly optimized for console, see the cons I've already listed.  EDIT: I can confirm that the game engine is like an alcoholic lover, though.",

So far the port is AMAZING, graphically speaking the port is great and there are no frame drops, no stuttering, no screen tearing, and runs very well on lower range PCs' if thats what your using. I have 7.3 hours in game and have only progressed 4%, if that tells you anything as to how long the campaign is. Also there are tons of side missions and other activities to do around the map. The combat system is easy to use and you can play really any way you see fit you can be a maniac and just go crazy playing the game like its Call of Duty, or you can go stealthily like it's meant to be played. Personally I like sniping, so i'll pick a decent spot to set up a good distance away since I haven't unlocked the sniper with the suppressor yet and headshot all the enemies and then go stealthy and sweep up the survivors. It's a very interesting and fun game, and is well worth $60.  Pros: A Hideo Kojima Game Good Port A blast to play Hours of Playtime Base Building/Maintaining Weapon Manufacturing Big Open World Soon to be multiplayer  Cons: Every once in a while during the tutorial it shows controller buttons and thumbsticks instead of keyboard keys or the mouse.

            "review_text": "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain in the ♥♥♥♥  Well, here we go...  It's great! Mostly. Sort of. Maybe.   I'm a little baffled to be honest how so many reviewers felt compelled to label this incoherent drivel a 'masterpiece'. Overall it's tactless, sexist, racist and goes NOWHERE. No thunderous crescendo, no epic boss fight, no resolution at all.  The gameplay? The experience to be had in the wide open world where the game ha syou spend most of your time? Great, varied and rich. Far Cry 2 with toys, to put it crudely. But what toys! So many and even by the games ending there were so many I hadn't taken for a spin. It never stops presenting you with options, limitless freedom to play about in a fun sandbox but one that is thankfully not aimless. You're constantly making decisions to build up Snake's mother base, replacing the one that got blown up in Zeroes. It's all very satisfying in a way that few sandbox experiences manage. Just Cause is another close comparison but it has none of the purpose of MGSV's open world experience.   What really helps too are the intuitive controls (save for the vehicles which are rubbish) and being allowed to improvise, overcoming failures instead of feeling like you really ought to reload a checkpoint. Every single mechanic and idea just meshes together giving you a massive arsenal but one that's never overwhelming. I loved every moment of running around on my horse or calling upon the aid of a trusty sniper, kidnapping soldiers with balloons and blaring 80s music into the faces of my enemies. For the majority of the time playing, Phantom Pain is a pure joy.   But not always. It starts off the bat with an impressive but baffling opening, dropping a hundred questions on your head before sending a Snake awoken from a coma out to Afghanistan on a quest for revengeance. This leads to the natural expectation that you will get answers or explanations to at least a few of the questions and mysteries born here. At least the major ones, right? Nope. Not one. Whilst the MGS games have always been incredibly daft, they've always been structured and paced smartly, excluding those troublesome cutscenes, and build to strong finales.  Not so in the Phantom Pain, where after a loud but disappointing middle act, it simply limps to the finale via several horridly difficult missions and several repeats of older missions for no real reason. 'Chapter Two' it's called, because I assume 'Chapter We're Rushing to Put Something Together, Quick Just Make Them Replay the Same Old ♥♥♥♥' was too long a title.  To rub salt in the wound, all these tiresome replays and frustrating final missions lead to one of the dumbest, most unsatisying endings ever with a reveal that's so pointless and stupid I felt dumber for simply having experienced it. Oh and it's a cliff hanger. In the last MGS game Kojima will ever make. Woo. 'Masterpiece'. Some will say the story 'doesn't matter' but A) That would be fine if the game didn't dedicate so much time to the damned stupidity and B) that's only half the problem. Cause as fun as kidnapping soldiers and running around in a lovely sandbox is, the game just never comes together to form a satisfying whole. It runs out of steam halfway through and never picks up again, leaving us chasing a conclusion that never comes in the hopes of providing some framework to our experiences. It never comes. Perhaps that's what Kojima was trying to tell us with 'The Phantom Pain?'  Although let's not give Kojima too much credit, since he's had enough of that already with his name plastered over every 20 seconds of gameplay. 'Written/Directed by Kojima'...'Starring Kojima'...'Based on melodies once whistled by Kojima.'  I know there's been a falling out with Konami in the background to this game but I don't doubt for a second that has nothing to do with Kojima satisfying his own vanity here. Or his perversions.  A lot of hoo-hah's already been made over the half naked 'character' Quiet (and rightly so!) but I've not got a lot more to add than yes, it's gross. The weirder part though is how it exists in this odd sexless vacuum. Unlike something like The Witcher or Mass Effect which take great pride in its nudity and sex, this game is so devoid of sex, passion or even the faintest whiff of romance, why they bothered to include Quiet at all is baffling. I mean, the mostly likely romantic relationship in the game would be Kaz and Snake, so why introduce Quiet at all when the game still refuses to have our characters do anything but growl over the horrors of war?  So it's pointless as well as tasteless.   And that's not even to mention the racist caricatures or the the tactful inclusion of 'Guest Starring Child Soldiers.'   So at the core, we have an imaginative, rich and deep game that's unparalleled as sandboxes go. The problem is it never becomes anything more, never becomes a journey or experience really worth remembering, unlike the most memorable of recent open world games or hell, obviously, just great games in general.  I began the game with tremendous enthusiasm and laughed and smiled through so much of my time with it but I came away feeling completely hollow. A waste of a great game in the end and somewhere far short of the positivity I've seen heaped upon the game.  I'd happily recommend it to anyone but with the major caveat that it all winds up feeling a bit pointless and cheap. Enjoy the journey whilst it lasts, the destination is not Outer Heaven.",

Pros:  -Immense amount of gameplay (48 hours got me 47% completion) -Amazing story (read/watch the story of the two games before this one to get the full experience) -Some of the most fun gameplay I have ever experienced -Intense bosses (during two of them, I thought my eart was going to fall out of my chest)  Cons:  -Checkpoints are a little scarce  Verdict:  Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is a fantastic game, and one of the best Metal Gear games.

If you don't mind using a controller with this game, then this game is truly like non other. Absolutely engrossing and mind-blowingly detailed. I honestly am not sure if this is a serious action game or not as I had so much fun and laughing during missions. The Fulton is the single best thing in this game. Never got tired of seeing things get swooped up into the sky and screaming/howling.   The management aspect of Mother Base is initially rather daunting but you'll get used to it and come to love it. Micro-managing it helps even more.   Basically, this game is a must-have. However, I still wish the KB+M support is better.

There have certainly been sandbox action games that have given me a bigger world to roam, or more little icons to chase on my minimap, but none have pushed me to plan, adapt, and improvise the way this one does.  Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain doesn’t just respect my intelligence as a player, it expects it of me, putting it in a league that few others occupy '  IGN says it all...

Cons -Season Pass only gives you costumes, none of the MGO expansions. I feel stiffed. -Boss fights with the Skulls are REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING ANNOYING. SERIOUSLY. Zero stealth involved in these. Just go pew pew with rockets or a sniper and hope to god you kill them fast enough. -MGO is incredibly unfair. Enforcers destroy Infiltrators and everything destroys Scouts.

The game basically WANTS you to play it slowly.    PROS:  *There are plenty of customization in the game which includes your chopper, base, avatar. *Many guns in the game calls for many types of ways to run missions and side-ops. *A lot of weather conditions which make the game challenging and realistic. *Plenty of material to run through. You will love it if you like stories. Very emotional as well, kind of like reading a book or watching a movie. *I'm actually happy that there aren't any restrictions on the loadout. Even if you have loadout not suited for the mission you can still call in a supply drop or a weapon change. *You can carry SOO MANY WEAPONS!!! Like literally, you can have 2 primary and another choice of a secondary   bionic arm????!!! . So literally you can have as many different types of weapons on a mission as you like. *Same thing with buddies as well! You can change buddies in between missions so lets say at first if you had   Quiet   and you wanted another buddy to move to a certain point faster you can call in D-Horse.  CONS:*You don't get to know all of the mission unlockables in the first go. They only tell you the important facts about what you need to get accomplished and basically leave the rest blank. You will only know what the 'hidden' side stuff are in the mission when you complete it.   *Mission 22 is kind of bad because you cannot redo that mission if you fail it. If you don't have a heads up before you recieve the mission and die while trying to finish it you will NOT BE ABLE to redo it!!! The downside is you will lose some assets that were signed to motherbase with the chance of getting stuff deranked.  You will be able to redo it if you abort mission 21 and then retake the mission from the mission list before doing mission 21.    *Wish some missions were clearer on what to do and where to go while having better map markers.  *If it's your first time playing a mission you have a choice of either manning it up and killing everything first to see what to do after reloading from checkpoint or you can crawl your way around everything and hope you don't get spotted because the AIs are SUPER SMART!!!! You get detected by 1 person and it's basically missions failed.  *If you don't have a 'decent' computer you won't feel the 'SUPER GOOD QUALITY OF THE VIEW!!!!'  *All drop requests cost GMP which is kind of hard to manage when you want to have all the upgrades available. Your crew will also start to leave the base if your GMP is in the red.  Broke with debt to employees like most companies nowadays    All in all it's a very nice game that will require you to put in a lot of time and effort to play. Don't expect to get A TON of % with 30 hours of gameplay   Unless you go for online guides which are relatively easy to find   ",

A horrible twist that makes no sense, and is meant to be metaphorical is in actuality lazy and rushed writing. Kojima is the George Lucas, of Metal Gear Solid.   The game plays diffrently than the other main titles of the series but is similar enough where the veterans will understand it and the noobs will not have trouble jumping into it. You will get your moneys worth of gameplay even trying to rush the story, there is plenty of activities and missions to do.  Instead of praising what works, because it does, work. Here is a long list of what was rushed garbage.  1. Although you are in Afghanistan during the Mujah, Russian War. You will never see more than 10 russians in one spot, more so it is about 5 at a time, and seperated by hundreds of feet. You will never see random militia running around, or even 1 random villager, in all of afghanistan, only mission related prisoner npcs and still the most at one time is 2.  2. There is an enemy type in this game, THAT SHOULD NOT BE IN METAL GEAR GAMES.  3. Although there are 2 entire countries to explore and do missions in, you will soon find out missions become repetive and the same thing in a different way 6 or 7 missions into the game, you will even start going to the SAME AREAS.  4. The reason Quiet, is ''quiet'', is attached to the horrible plot.  5. There is a boss in this game, that also SHOULD NOT BE IN A METAL GEAR GAME.  6. A ending twist that they think fills all the gaps, fills no gaps.  7. You have seen every mission type in less than a quarter through the game.  8. No David Hayter, at all.  9. IN TOTAL- there is only 4 boss fights, but some of them you have to beat multiple times, the exact same fight, but slightly harder, thats it. NONE of them are memorable charecters like the other games.  10. Stop blaming Konami, KOJIMA wrote this crap.  ",

MGS is one of the biggest sagas of the games industry with one amazing plot, everyone who ever played a MGS can say that.  MGS: POP is the lost chapter in the saga, the final piece in the kojimas puzzle and when you finish the game you really get amazed, trying to figure out what really happen here until truth came out. I only have three complains about the game:  1. Too much sidequest and main misions thats not have any relation or relevance into the main story, a lot of fillers trying to expand the gametime. 2. The game is thinking like mini chapters so is more like a serie or tv show... to be continued, this break the flow of game, totally different from others MGS games where the story was fluid without useless pauses. 3. In the FOB mision (where you invade others players mother bases) looking for resources, soldiers, weapons you can steal from them, is really a great disadventage for new players and people who are not interested in online mode, so you need invest in security gadgets and other stuff.  The game gave you a lot of good surprise you never know what happens next or why happen, the stealth game one of the main characteristic of the MGS saga stays the almost the same like GZ, is my personal opinion the slow motion setting is a nuinsance for the stealth experienced is like put in silver plate the game for new players and lost a lot of the game main charm.   I really enjoy the game and think is worth it of the price, specially the buddy system is great and pretty fun in some misions, but unfortunately is not the best MGS if you are looking for that youll get dissapointed, after you end the game are a few loose ends about the story but that is always the kojima style.  Finally i really recommend to you this game specially if you are a fan of the MGS saga or like stealth games, i hope you enjoy this so much as i writting this review.  Regards,  Grimoire",

Pros: -Lots of customizable features, more than any game in the MGS series -Good graphic and well optimized -Absolutely amazing sound track Cons: -Incomplete story, the game just awkwardly ended without explaining many charactors' fate -Quite's outfit and weird behaviors such as slapping her boobs and ♥♥♥ on the camera are totally unnecessary -Waaaayyyyy too much story contents are in the audio tapes -The story is confusing for new players. I had no idea what's happening in the game for the first few hours, so I had to watch MGS3:Snake Eater and MGS:peace walker on youtube to make the story make sence. -The side ops are too redundant, I had to play the same mission on the exact location over and over again. In conclusion, MGSV:TPP is more like an unfinished game. It could be a master piece, but Kojima and Konami ♥♥♥♥ed it up. 7/10",

Just watch -- you'll play until you forget what your objective was, and when you notice this, it won't matter anyway. Sneak up on everyone, everything, everywhere, with any tactic, in any weather, with anybody, for any reason.  This is what MGS was meant to be. The sheer variety of well-designed areas, cool buddies and setpiece battles make it a very long and exciting game. The extensive military and base-management elements are more than icing on the cake; you'll find yourself pausing in a bush, ten meters away from an enemy, and using your iDroid to unlock and upgrade or send soldiers on a mission. Not every fan is happy with the story, but whether or not you like it -- it will make you 'feel'. All the tension (enemies are a credible threat, especially in large teams -- yes, they coordinate) and attachment to your buddies and base (you'll love at least one of your mission partners) make it certain that The Phantom Pain will leave you with a longing ache when the battles are done and the wounds have healed.  (Update) MGO3 is here! For MGO2 fans: the three classes definitely make for a different competitive style, but TSNE (now called 'Cloak and Dagger') feels much the same as it always did. And for the first time, stealth play is rewarded with the inclusion of fultons -- you can earn extra points and help the team by restoring tickets in Bounty Hunter. Sneak up on the best players and turn the tides of war! The knife is apparently going to return in a future patch. Unfortunately, headshots are no longer instant kills, but this change was necessary to make the different HP of each class important. You also no longer need to buy weapons and components in-match; loadouts are added. The SOP system is gone, but there are skills with similar functions in the game. I've really been enjoying MGO3 so far.",

It has:   Character customization, Weapon customization, Building your own base (type of mini-game), great story, great controls, great Visuals, the game is so far the best optimized game I ever played, you can also drive vehicles !  I am having soo much fun with it. Sneaking my way undetected feels awesome, but if you get spotted, well then , you just go guns blazing. AI is smart and you're gonna have problem with him, they use covering fire, throw grenades, flank you. AI is very good, it's very easy to die here. Also, the game has a Multiplayer.  Now what are the things I don't like: - Story is too short and feels uncompleted. - Nothing to do after you complete all primary and secondary ops. You can replay same mission again, gets boring when there is no point and constant repetition. (It's gonna take you some time until you complete all ops.) - Multiplayer.  First of all, having a simple Multiplayer like in MGS V, where you just go around and kill other players is good, for relaxing and just shooting around. But problem is that tranquilizer gun is better than bullets from your rifles, one shot and you start sleeping while with rifle bullets, you have to hit your opponet several times before you kill them. Also the stupid thing I saw, if you see a puppy toy, your soldier stops and start looking at it and you can't move. So enemy comes and either shoots you or strangles you. WTF Japan!?   Multiplayer is nothing like SinglePlayer, it's a simple guns blazing around with deathmatch rules. It's not bad, it just has this stupid ideas that are unnecessary.

This is the most accessible Metal Gear game to date, with moment to moment gameplay that is quirky, brutal, and consistently satisfying. If you're a fan of stealth or games that keep you engrossed through every session, this is your game. You're always unlocking new items, building up Mother Base, finding new and awesome ways to complete objectives, and it's all equally well done. The production values are absolutely top knotch. The game runs flawlessly on my rig, and I've been hearing it scales to different systems very well.

Well, I have not played any other MGS games aside from about half or so of MGS 2 (although I do plan on playing the rest asap... just can't seem to find them time) so my perspective on MGS V is not one of amazing expectations, it is one of a newbie to the series who does not know what to expect. And I have to say... This game is fantastic. From the sounds of the few negative reviews with high ratings it seems the expectations for this game were insainly high... and it didn't meet all of them. The story is done in a different fashion compared to other MGS games, but I honestly didn't mind. The 20m cutscenes I found in MGS 2 were interesting, but they overstayed their welcome (at least for me) and being able to progress the story at my own pace is a great thing.    The highest rated Steam Reviews are all negative because people seem dissapointed in the product. I feel that this does not do the game justice, as it is a fantastic game on its own. Now, maybe it's not as good as MSG3, but it's still fantastic. Yes, it could be better. Yes, the microtransactions are annoying. BUT, the game is still fantastic. It might not have lived up to the hype, but I promise you that doesn't mean it's a bad game.   To go off topic here...  This game is the exact example of why Valve is smart NOT to release Half Life 3.  No matter how good it is, people will just be dissapointed that it wasn't the perfect game they all wanted. Nothing is ever perfect.   Update: The Multiplayer was... Disapointing. I didn't think it added much to the game and it was similar to CoD in my eyes. Single player is more than worth the price of admision (Especially at $40), but don't expect much from the multiplayer.",

This Mr.Kojima last work and it the last game for Metal Gear series. I'm not going to say about 'Survive' here if you all already knew about that 'game'(to be honest and fair,it should be suit it as add-on or dlc for MGO3), but what i want to say is MGO3. Metal Gear Online 3 is basiclly a call of duty in 3rd person view character you make and first person view for the option of iron sight and scope. Gameplay is the same as MGSV but there few of them are for MGO3 only. What different than CoD is you can decide either go gun blazing or sneak trough opposition line(the red team). There are 3 class for your characters and i suggest try all class depend on which characters you want in to be class with.  There 3 play mode, Automatch,SelectMatch and Survival. Automatch is the same as Selectmatch but the only different is your rank(F to S++) will go up or down depend on how you perform in the match and it also give Gear Point for buying some uniform and other stuff(Note:all uniform and other stuff it just cosmetic like cosplay your character). The Selectmatch is the same except those two thing but you can create you own match if want. Survival is same way like those 2 mode but you can play with friend as the team and get better award(win 5 time without losing),but there 1 problem, you and your friend have to wait other players doing the same as you are. I recommend go play 2 mode instead 'Survival'. There are 4 match: Bounty Hunter(TeamDeathmatch) Com.Control(Capture type) Clock and Dagger..i think(Capture type except 1 team go sneaking and 1 team going defend and Sabotage(Capture type like C&amp;D but either destroy the target or capture it).  Lastly is mircotransation, meaning some item like skin color can't be bought with gear point. So it up to you whether you want it or not.I suggest buy what you NEED only.  Begin the bad topic on MGO3, each time you win or lose, you gain exp point to level up,when level up you get new weapons and mod for your char.Here what my issue. First, weapons feel less than mgsV on 3 classes.I don't know how many mgo2 weapons have,but they need add it new weapons for this game soon. Second, always know some games are not perfect, you will randomly get glitches and bug so it rare and also some players you encounter will cheating and hacking in the match. Finally is the less content, i was hope a new mode in mgo3 will have solo or co-op for fun instead 'Survive'!  One think i would like it is to have all your characters you make able to play in MGSV for fun if they think about.  So that all what i think about it. So enjoyz!",

            "review_text": "Spoiler Free  Gameplay- It's f*cking fun, stealth mechanics are nothing new but work well and feel rewarding. Not repetitive due to locations changing placements and so on, feel like every so often I go into a place I've been to before and notice change. There's a pretty good upgrade list as well but guns do feel a bit lame, more like shooting a bb gun. There are however a couple of missions which are absolute wank, e.g.- throwing waves of tanks and mech at you for not much reason when you could just sneak away. Shooting works well enough but bullet spray is jacked up for you, enemies seem to shoot a closer group, so make the first shot count/dont get seen.  Also you get to rescue and Fulton extract Hideo Kojima.   Graphics- Graphics are nice to look at, not groundbreaking but 10/10 mlg optimisation makes it so much nicer, it just feels like it works properly. Not to say there aren't bugs there are a couple but mostly funny, non major things. Only ui problem is that it's all console commands. The auto settings work very well, I turned up anti-aliasing and that was it. There's a slight drop in fps when stuff gets absolutely crazy but nothing like jumping onto a ship in AC: Black Flag and having to fight at 7fps.  Sound- Pretty good, environmental stuff is nice, funky bullet sounds, animals sound a bit weird and so does revolver but I think that's just him. Only gripe is I can't hear what the f*ck people are saying, I had to put subtitles on because there's no option to tweak levels (might be in .ini files). Also revolver and miller sound the same over the radio, listening to them argue is like listening to a crack addict with multiple personality disorder have a bit of an episode. Tapes can be picked up and if you buy speakers for the chopper you can blast Aha- Take on Me while rocketing an Afghan checkpoint to bits. Also you can tell it's translated due to some sections sounding well too overdramatic and the presence of 'memes'.   Story- I'm not good enough to play the older ones, fully just rage quit the first level of MGS3, but all story components are online and some are also explained in game. There's some pretty deep moments but I didn't actually even know it ended, I was expecting some kind of tragedy grand finale but no it just kinda stopped. There is a much deeper story through tapes you listen to which are interesting but what happened to MGS4's hour and a half cutscenes? I was kinda expecting something more cinematic. Sitting and listening to a 10 minute tape of Zero talking isn't that fun despite his 'British' accent.   Character developement doesn't really happen in terms of the overiding story, don't want to spoil it but people don't go down the paths they should do in terms of the story, or if they do it's not shown well at all. Especially in terms of moral descisions, it leaves a lot of unanswered questions, I only hope they add on more missions later.   Saying that I did care for what was actually going on in the story which doesn't happen too often. Characters are all interesting especially Quiet &lt;3 (I'm not a weeb I just have a crush on Stefanie Joosten the model that plays her). Annoying thing is later on trying to progress onto the next mission requires you to either listen to story tapes or do two side missions, I just feel it's a bit long winded and breaks the story up a bit unneccesarily. Also some missions feel really out of place and force combat which can be a bit daunting having spent hours throwing people in dumpsters and getting trick longshots with the zzz pistol.   Overall I'd say it's worth the money for the gameplay and fun factor but just dont expect a story like the other games.",

I do recommend the game because visually it's stunning. PC optimization is fantastic, and if you like stealth games it's always great. However, this MGS feels rushed and in no way like an actual MGS title. Your cutscenes? Pretty much gone. Codec calls? Replaced by tapes, which for someone that has access to all the things Big Boss has is a little weird.   My main problem with the game is that it's for the most part just washed rinsed and repeated. Follow this person. Save this person. Extract this person. And.....well.......not much else. This feels like the entire development team stopped caring after Konami and Kojima had their falling out. I don't exactly know what more to say except if you're like me and need the rest of the story give it a play, but if you don't know anything about MGS wait for a sale.  It also feels like Konami just cut Kojima's budget and time and just pushed a game out that needed more time to make. I'm unfortunately switching my recommendation.   TL;DR: This game is fantastic, but not worth 59.99 for a person who has real time invested in the saga.",

This is an awesome game to play even if you dont like MGS. The open world play is really fun and makes me think of the original Mercenaries. A little ways into the game you gain the ability to call in weapon drops and airstrikes which let you bail yourself out of a corner or change play styles on the fly to adapt to a new threat. The buddy system really doesn't shine until you get the all famous Quiet. I can't tell you how much time I've wasted practicing assaulting random fortified enemy positions at night under her sniper cover. Once you understand how to utilize her effectively you can really use good team tactics to overwhelm superior enemies with surprise and violence of action.   The game really lets you develop your own play style with a huge variety of customizable weapons as well. Combined with Quiet, you can tag team snipe your enemies, 'think playstation' and blow up sh## with impunity, sneak through a base and kidnap all its defenders, plus more. The fulton system is a little silly but after getting over that it becomes an awesomly fun mechanic of the game.  This MGS does make some effort to get you to use non-lethal as the other MGS titles do but you aren't directly penalized if you don't. The different outfits also play into the game incredibly well and can make the difference in a heavy situation.  Overalll, it is one of the more 'realistic' feeling shooter games where you have to actually think before you act and bullets really kill both you and your enemies. The story is interesting but can be set aside to enjoy some good old fashoned trigger time. The graphics are great and help with immersion. My only complaint is the lack of civilians.

There's no freedom to set up your own custom defenses and everyone's bases end up being exactly the same. At first I thought the decks were random but after playing for a short time I noticed they repeat much more often than not. It isn't really random, there are less than a handful presets. Still, the FOB matches do provide some moderate fun for a while.  Though, If you want some more challenging sneaking experience, Ground Zeroes is better than The Phantom Pain. Actually, I think the story of Ground Zeroes is also better. It's a short, but superior game, overall.  After all that is said, I still have to recommend this game as the masterpiece it is! It is one of Hideo Kojima's METAL GEAR SOLID after all, so playing it is mandatory for any fan of the series. The characters are beautiful, the story is involving and better written than previous games and it finishes up explaining everything that was still left up in the air from the stories of the other games. The game is easy but still fun and you'll want to keep playing until the end. Then you'll miss Quiet's neverending humming in your ears and want to start all over again.",

It's hard to find a solid stealth action game these days but MGS has always set the standard and this one is no different. It's fluid to control and while difficult to master there's something amazing about pulling off an S rank on a mission with no detections.  It's fun. Hands down it's just plain fun.  Now I'll admit the first half of the game is WAY MORE SOLID than the latter half. This game really isn't 'finished' but look at my play time and see if I got my money's worth. The 2nd half has a lot of repeat missions with quirks such as no detections allowed or procure all items on site. They're fun but they're just there to add more meat to the 2nd half.   The story is engaging and well written. You don't *need* backstory but it makes the game that much more thrilling when you're already invested in the characters. The ending is, like the 2nd half of the game, rushed and I understand why people complain about it. I personally really enjoyed it and I can't really find myself complaining. It's clear that Kojima had a grand view for this game and Konami just didn't want to give him another few years to finish it.   If you like stealth games or just well written, fun, engaging, unique and superb action you will probably like this game. It has all sorts of nooks and crannies to explore and play with. It's silly yet very serious. It's unfinished but left me more satisfied than most other games in recent memory. I really love these games.  If you're on the fence maybe try it out at a friend's house before you dive in but if you're willing to drop $30 on a sale for something you don't see every day I would highly recommend it.",

However, the story is where it falters; there really isn't all that much story, and what little there is feels very unfinished and adds nothing to the existing Metal Gear lore. It seems like the game was intended to provide backstory on characters such as Liquid Snake and Psycho Mantis, but it ends up making more loose ends than it started with. The only character it successfully gives a backstory on is Venom Snake, but he nothing more than a boss from the first Metal Gear game, which has been all but forgotten. All in all, if you are expecting another masterpiece from the Metal Gear you will be very disappointed, but it is still an excellent stealth game.   TL;DR not a good Metal Gear game, but still has great gameplay",

Still love it, just curious as to why. It seems as the previous MGS, if you knocked out a guard, a tranq would completely override the stun for the normal tranq time.  Like I said, only logical issue (game mechanics-wise) with the game. Love it in every single way, from start of series to this iteration. Thank you Kojima.

You will fulton any animal you find: From goats, wolves, eagles to dangerous bears. Vehicle fultoning is also fun and rewarding: Jeeps, trucks, machine guns, mortars, tanks....  You will evolve and design strategic tactical plans to try fultoning bosses, kids, yourself or anything you can imagine.

This game has amazing graphics, good voice acting, story rich, Award winning gameplay (actually I think it already has an award), a... mixed online mode (the lag is terrible, don't buy this game purely for MGO3), etc. The DLC for MGO3 is a little BS such as lazily taking maps from single player just to put them in as DLC but again don't buy this purely for MGO3, it's not worth it, the $50 was for the game itself not the laggy online mode, that's why it's not a seperate DLC or something. ONE THING though that really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, if you're running this on minimum requirements (it might be just me so don't be too worried) be prepared to crash every 5 minutes. I'm actually suprised I have in 20 hours let alone any. Taking this in to consideration, i'd give it my rating of 6/10 due to the crashing, otherwise it'd be a solid 10/10. BUT THIS IS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, if the game works for you, then you're going DEFINITELY not going to regret it, even I have no regrets to the point where i'm going to keep it until I get a better PC for this game, yes I love it that much.

Then after a while, I suddenly realized something. This might be the best game I have ever played. Time that would usually mean finishing another game just zipped by in this one. I don't like exaggarated stories, I only have limited patience for over-the top theatrics... but this game just weaved it into a very captivating experience.  In the end, I felt empty. Not because the game is unfinished, because it isn't. But because there wasn't more.

If something is lodged in your brain you wouldn't be able to jump, nod your head too hard or walk, et cetera because our brains constantly move around in our skull. If something was stuck in his brain like that he'd have the worst migrain, be dizzy, blurry vision, brain damage, and every time he moved he'd probably go into a seizure, his brain would bleed and he'd die. It's so cringy every time I see that stupid thing jutting out of his. Seriously so stupid. However... I'm just beginning to play it and it's starting to feel like it might be fun. Still though... 3rd-person shooters are so lame and it's been a challenge to enjoy this one for the first hour of 'play' time. Horse control is garbage/janky. More console crap. Silensor looses effectiveness? Not in real life. Gonna look for a mod that reverses that crap... worried I won't be able to mod the game easily because it's console ported. #FUCONSOLES Okay... editing as I play here. Figuring out some stuff that is arguably unintuitive... However, I am having fun... The graphics are nice (though I have every thing maxed out since I have a really great rig to handle it). The AI seem refreshingly smart. They see you go off in a direction the search to that direction. And there are flares that they shoot up in the viscinity as they try to search for you. It's pretty cool actually.  I'll write more but it's official now I can recommend this game with confidence. Just make it past the first half hour and any master race issues you might have like me with consoles and the game will prove to be fun.  Okay... the open world stuff - the bulk of the game is too fun.   Only thing tho?... Not comfortable with the whole 'the West' is supporting the Muslims so much. The Muslim religion is rampant and spanning the globe now as Christianity dwindles. Jesus is for peace as Mohammad was a warrior. I don't dig the idea that this game is somehow a propaganda tool for the spread and acceptance of Islam. Part of me wishes that I was helping the Christian soldiers that are Russian in this game. Is what it is.  For fun sake? Recommended... Think too much about the implication and politics and I wouldn't... Most people don't think so I'll recommend this game.",

From a pure gameplay perspective, it's leaps and bounds ahead of all of its predecessors. I've not had this much fun, or felt compelled to do so much in an open world game in years.  There's so much content, so much attention to detail and so many little things going on, that I think this is some of the best value for money you can get in gaming.  Do you NEED to know the story from previous MGS games? No. Does it help? Yes. But I think this game is capable of standing relatively apart from the others and can still be a great experience. Kojima, as always, delivers. Also...you can have a dog. A dog that wears a sneaking suit. A dog that wears a sneaking suit, and can pull a knife from his little holster and stab a guy in the throat.

To give a thorough review I'd have to use several pages, so I'll stick to the important parts:  -ABSOLUTELY MOST IMPORTANT: Hideo Kojima is a monster and will toy with your emotions like you're his little Barbie doll in the world of 'W-T-F????' BUT ONLY IN CHAPTER 2. Don't be like 40% of the players on Steam who finished Chapter 1 (mission 31) and then gave up once missions started repeating. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY THE REPEAT MISSIONS TO FINISH THE STORY, PLAY THE NEW MISSIONS AND DO THE STORY SIDE-OPS. There are FOUR endings for FOUR characters beyond the end of Chapter 1, and each of these were like a punch in the gut to me. Anybody who reviews the game without having seen ALL FOUR of the real endings has missed out on the most memorable parts of the game.  -The controls are complex and take some getting used to. Even after you're used to them you'll still mess things up frequently because the game engine is awful in certain particular situations  -The above point is irrelevant because the combat in MGSV is so interesting and fun that you'll forget you were discovered due to a buggy engine and not because you actually made a mistake... It's almost like a reward for encountering a bug. There are many weapons, many tools, and many ways to make your way through an enemy outpost; even after being discovered you can still ditch the enemies on your trail and go back to using stealth (with the base now on alert).  -MGSV is sort of three-games-in-one. You have the story, you have Metal Gear Online (deathmatch/multiplayer), and you have a base-building game where you collect soldiers, vehicles, equipment, and resources to power up your base. Chances are that you'll like at least one of these because of how different they are.  -So important I need to say it twice: literally 40% of steam players who beat chapter 1, missed out on the endings in chapter 2 (I looked up achievement rates). For me, each one of those four endings was enough to blow my mind and make this game one of my favorites... for all four of them to be so stunning is a testament to Hideo Kojima's skill as a director. Like remember the whole scarecrow bit from Batman: Arkham Asylum? That's the level of, 'WTF AM I SEEING???' that these endings brought... and many people missed out on them.",

Granted, not having played the recent MGS titles will make some of the narrative seem like malarkey to you. Audio cassettes are provided to give exposition which will understandably turn off some people. Moving on to the gameplay, the Phantom Pain provides an open world that gives free reign over how to accomplish the objective ranging from espionage, assassinations, sabotage, and etc. Stealth is the preferable method as far as I can tell but it’s not the only way. The replay ability is really high with the variety tasks to be completed in the missions. Free roaming in the game is useful in collecting resources for building up your Mother Base along with collecting soldiers to grow your army. I’ve had few qualms with the game such as the stiffness of the controls especially while sneaking and the checkpoints are few during the missions so messing up could mean starting over from the beginning. Other than that, great port from Konami. I recommend to anyone looking for heavy story-driven game or a good stealth-action game.",

Pros: Whilst the story is a bit messy of my taste, the stealth mechanics are real neat. Now you can choose to go in loud and or bring a helicopter to take over bases etc but for me the sneaking's the most fun and effective. The game looks cool and runs well atleast for me and you get addicted to it easily. Which I hope is a good thing.. Also it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.  Cons: Where's David Hayter? The story and the message of the game is a bit weak and the missions get boring before completing the game. (Cause the places look the same and there's like 50 missions and 300 sidequests..)   In short a good wrap up of the MGS franchise's mysteries and a remind of how great it is.  If you're into the sneaky stealth games then get it.. But I gotta warn ya the story of Metal Gear Solid's great and if you styart with playing MGS 5: TPP it will ruin it for ya. Probably..

            "review_text": "After finally beating the game 100% and playing Metal Gear Online for a few hours I feel like I should write a review for this game. It took me around 140 hours to reach 100% completion and this requires you to get S rank on all missions, complete all side-ops, collect all animals, and do all side objectives in every mission. If I didn't mess around in a lot of that time then I probably could have beaten it in 100-120 hours. When compared to other Metal Gear games this one seems to have the most replay value for its single player. The only other one which comes close for me is Peace Walker which I played for approximately 100 hours on the PS3.  The gameplay in Metal Gear Solid 5 is different enough from past Metal Gear games to feel fresh. It's more of a sandbox than previous games as you're given many different ways to complete your objectives. They all boil down to a stealthy approach or guns blazing in the end but they give you many toys to play with. Once you reach the end of the game you're likely going to have a large amount of weapons. Especially if you develop your FOBs and take advantage of the online development projects(displayed as gold boxes).  FOBs are your Forward Operating Bases. Each one of them allows you to add 100 staff members to each of your squads for a grand total of 700 staff members per FOB. If you want the best weapons in the game then you need to have a few FOBs. The only downside to having FOBs is that you might get invaded and lose some of your staff members(lock the important ones so you don't lose them). It most likely won't happen or at least won't happen often as long as you don't have any nukes or participate in the security challenge. If you are going to build a nuke for the achievement then make sure to do this offline so you can dismantle the nuke immediately and get the other achievement.  Now to talk about the story. This is probably Metal Gear Solid V's weakest point. The story isn't terrible but it feels incomplete. I'm not going to go into too much detail about that but you're left with many questions and the ending is completely anti-climactic. It was so anti-climactic that many people thought that there was more to the game and went on a wild goose chase to find the 'true ending'. Unfortunately, it's not like Peace Walker and there is no secret ending. What you see is what you get. It's not the perfect bridge between Big Boss's story and Solid Snake's story but I think it's the best we can hope for at this point.  After beating the game you might do what I did and try to get 100% completion. This is much more difficult to do than I thought it would be. Not because the missions are geniunely difficult but because of bugs I didn't notice the first time around. Once you start aiming for the optional objectives then you'll probably run into the same bugs that I did. Prisoners not spawning in, conversations never beginning, and other small issues which will eventually grind down your patience with the game. Some characters need to follow a very strict path and if anything interrupts them then you will either miss a conversation or the conversation will end early. This could be anything from your dog running into them or getting too close to the area where an interrogation is supposed to take place which somehow makes the interrogation target trip on the door frame. The second glitch I mentioned can be solved by keeping at least 60 meters away from the last interrogation room in Lingua Franca until the target is in the middle of the room and the interrogation is about to start.  The side-ops are pretty fun at first but then they start feeling repetitive. It might be fun to eliminate the heavy infantry the first few times but after the 10th time you'll likely feel like it's a hassle. The same goes with the other mission types. In the end I found myself just going in to the elimination side-ops guns blazing to get them done as fast as possible. Of course, I only felt like this after the first 100 hours or so. I can't really say that the side-ops were terrible but they weren't as fun as the ones from Peace Walker and they were definitely not that rewarding. Especially since it's not co-op and you're not playing with other people.  The animal collection is probably the only thing I really hated about the game. The rest is either disappointing or mildly annoying. Not only does it not make sense to gather all of the different animals but other than a couple of them(especially the Jehuty) there was no real reward to get them. Just some GMP, heroism, and an emblem piece. If there wasn't an achievement then I probably wouldn't have done it. This is different from the music which has no achievement but I collected willingly because the music itself was a reward. As a side note, I have had Too Shy stuck in my head for the last few hours.  As for the graphics, there's not much to say there. The graphics are pretty good and the game played pretty smoothly for my computer. There were only a few times when I noticed it dipping down but it didn't feel like it ever hit 30 FPS. As I've got an Intel i7 3770K and an Nvidia GTX 780 this wasn't really unexpected. I don't play with Motion Blur or Depth of Field but I had everything else maxed out in 1080p and locked my framerate to 60 in Rivatuner. Since I never looked at my FPS I can't really say much more.  I loved the soundtrack to MGSV since I like a lot of songs from the 80s but I feel like they should have had other Metal Gear songs included. This is easily solvable by adding the songs to the game yourself though so I can't really fault the game on this part. Just put your MP3s in the CustomSoundtrack folder found in the game's folder.  All in all I'd say that the game is worthy of getting an 8/10 if you consider a 5/10 to be average. I think that if they added in the Battle Gear, allowed co-op gameplay in the story, fixed the conversation bugs, and completed the story then it'd definitely deserve a perfect score.  Metal Gear Online is pretty fun but I'm kind of bad at it. I mostly played MGSV by taking advantage of the AI using distractions so I'll have to get used to going up against other people. In the meantime, I apologize to any team members that I end up dragging down with me. Also, it'd be nice if there were people that played more than one game type.",

            "review_text": "Unfinished, disappointing story, good gameplay. Not recommended for MGS fans.       Edit: I'll elaborate a bit:            (Spoilers ahoy)           Remember the whole 'The missing link that will solve the biggest mystery in MGS history!'?  Yeah that went well.  The story has an unbelievable amount of plot holes, straight up unfinished character arcs, a reliance on one rather convenient plot device to explain pretty much anything out of the ordinary (*cough* worse than nanomachines *cough*) and generally ends up being unsatisfying considering the inherent lack of any real boss fights (except the 1 Metal Gear), a weak main villain, the most unfitting use of the main theme since I can remember in any video game in the past decade, an over-reliance on recycled missions that make up more than 70% of the content, coupled with almost MMO-like side-ops that act as filler to the main game. Venom Snake barely speaks at all, which actually acts to the detriment of the game, as he just ends up staring cluelessly and awkwardly in most cutscenes, much like I did after I finished the game. 2/3 of the game has been cut out, and that is not an exaggeration. The third chapter is not even in the game, and the second one just screams 'we couldn't finish this, sorry' as it is filled with 80% recycled missions from the first chapter and 20% 'new' missions that make you visit the same places. In fact, the trailers for the game have MORE cutscenes than the actual game. The trailers actually use pretty much every semi-important cutscene in the game that isn't 'Snake goes to Mother Base to take a shower' and they even feature some cutscenes that were not featured in the actual game at all. The game also features these 'moral choices' because apparently this is fashionable in 2015, but it falls flat considering you get a whopping 1 (one) 'moral' choice and one illusionary choice that has the same outcome regardless of what you pick.  The gameplay, while probably the closest the MGS series has come to 'true stealth', isn't without its' faults. The 'open world' is really just 2 medium-sized maps that are mostly barren, barring the occasional goat and guard outpost. You get to visit these guard outposts/bases about 10 times or more, which makes them almost insufferable in the late game, when most of the game just revolves around you re-visiting places you've already been to numerous times. There is no 'find a steam friend' function to the online invasion system, so abandon all hopes of playing with a friend. Much like Ground Zeroes, where it had the very tedious trials to artificially inflate gametime, this game has side-ops, extra objectives and animal rescuing, among others. While not inherently flawed as an idea, the side-ops are just dumb, with amazing missions such as 'Mine Clearing 15', 'Eliminate the Armored Vehicle Unit 20', 'Rescue the Prisoner 14', the extra objectives work wonders when paired with the bad lua scripts that make obtaining some of them straight up hell (I'm looking at you, 'listen to the full conversation between x and y') and apparently I was wrong to think that I could collect animals by finding them in the actual game and catching them. No, that would make too much sense. You find SOME animals that way, sure, but it's only about 30-40%. To get the rest (which you could have found and captured in MGS3 , mind you) , you have to place a capture cage on the ground and hope the RNG gods give you a rare animal when you extract. Great. Mother Base is mostly empty, you only really go there to see the occasional cutscene and maybe practice for online invading. The AI is also dumb. Really dumb. The 'I just accidentally ran over a fellow guard with my truck, I should alert HQ that we have an intruder' kind of dumb.  There are many other points and flaws I could analyze endlessly, but the general conclusion is the same.  I'm not sure whether it's because Kojima and Konami had a falling out or if Kojima just lost his writing ability ever since MGS4, but this is the weakest Metal Gear game in terms of story.  'But, you don't have to enjoy the story! You can just play the game!' I hear people cry. Sure, why would anyone enjoy the story in a game series that is famous for the length of its' cutscenes and its' story?  Be that as it may, the satisfaction of playing as Big Boss, the legendary mercenary, really goes down when you you find out that you're actually just 'some guy' who is in pretty much every sense of the word 'Big Boss' except that the story dictates that he's not just to shove a weak plot twist down your throat and to make some dumb point about the title of 'Big Boss'.",

I'll just make a list without trying to ♥♥♥♥♥ out over how I really feel about this game  Pros: -Story starts off Solid... -Open world is interesting at first -Graphics are great -Animations are superb, maybe the best out there right now -Guns feel good, really great aiming with M+K  Cons: -Story starts off Solid, but quickly turns into Liquid ♥♥♥♥ -Stealth is extremely simplistic and the game is very easy unless you gimp yourself (Even then it's still easy). Durability on supressors does nothing at all except become an annoyance as the player could easily call in a supply drop for a new one/hold up enemies/use CQC. AI is also ♥♥♥♥ and doesn't become better until Mission 30ish for some odd reason. -Open World adds NOTHING to this game, can't explore beyond certain areas during missions. Could have just broken up the open world into levels and made the game a linear experience and you'd get the same result. -Buddies are OP as ♥♥♥♥. As much as I love D-Dog, he marks every enemy for me which I don't like. As for Quiet, as much as I don't mind fanservice, that's the only reason she's ♥♥♥♥ing in game. She's one of the cringiest characters I have ever seen. -Kiefer Sutherland is woefully underused. He has some amazing moments in this game and I think hardcore Hayter fans can even admire his work, but Kojima decided it would be a good idea to make an already established character a self-insert protagonist meaning he doesn't talk much, just listens. -Twist is ♥♥♥♥ing obvious, Kojima dropped the hint way too many times to the point where the player could figure it out before beating the PROLOGUE.  I'm hoping I'll dump 10 more hours into this game, but even after using Cheat Engine to experience the various different weapons and gadgets, the game just isn't fun. I bought into the hype and thought this game looked excellent from the trailers, but I'm just going to say this now.  Whatever trailers you watched of MGSV, they do NOT REPRESENT THE FINAL GAME AT ALL.  About MGO: Played maybe an hour of Bounty Hunter, felt cheap and a complete unnecessary addition to the game. Imagine the resources that could have gone to making the Singleplayer actually good if the MP didn't exist.",

I didn't like the inability to jump and would find this exceedingly aggrevating when trying to escape a firefight. But the glitchy slides up rock faces and the almost jerky movement would further my dislike of Snake. The psychotically long runs between places didn't add to the realism, so much as make for some very boring running. And Snake sounds like he runs with the horses, he's so noisy.  Also, trying to figure out how to assign your team to do missions behind the scenes was an exercise in futility. I never managed to have one successful outing. What about side missions - no, not the actual side missions, but the ones that allow 100% completion of a mission? Well you don't even get to know what they are until you complete the mission one full time, meaning you have to do every mission at least twice if you want to complete everything. And actual side missions? You can complete one a dozen times and somehow it keeps coming back!  Lastly, speaking of running too far... what about your base. Even using a helicopter to 'fast travel' seems to be a display of how it really would be circling repeatedly over a base... again and again until landing.  Overall, I've played many first and third person games and have finished all of them. This is the first time I feel I grossly wasted money - I uninstalled it after mission 11. I kept trying to go back to it, to complete it, but found it too tedious. There are better games out there and I've spent my money far better on Steam in the past. This was a major let down.

            "review_text": "Even if the game had been completed, even if Kojima and Konami had the jolliest of cooperation during development, MGSV will still be a major disappointment. Even as it's own game, it's pretty mediocre..  As someone who has 20 hours into Ground Zeroes, I was pumped for MGSV; and, as someone with 20 hours in GZ, I can safely say Camp Omega was the best level in all of MGSV... by far. The levels are so basic and boring, barely any of them being unique or complexly assembled (like Camp Omega). Even the good levels become a bore ought to how many times you'll need to infiltrate them. This game has a horrible progression system, and that's not even to hide the cut content. MGSV is so horribly placed. You'll play for hours and not progress in the story or unlock more gameplay features. Was it fun? Yes, on and off, for about the first 10 to 20 hours. After that, no, it just become the same thing over and over. Maybe if the game had stuck to the 'realistic' tone Kojima had been going for, it all wouldn't have been so monotonous. The reason we aren't using rations and carrying 20 different weapons at all times is to supposedly make the game grounded in reality. It was like that in Ground Zeroes, and for the first 2 hours of TPP. After 10 hours, the player will be abducting tanks will giant balloons while fending off soldiers with Snake's rocket propelled prosthetic arm.  A lot of people like to praise that there's so much to do in this game. Well, that content becomes stretched really thin with this much padding. Plus, once you discover the most efficient way of sneaking past (suppressed sniper rifle and running up to anything and hitting LMB) there's no incentive to play the game differently. The slow progression and constant reuse of levels (even in Chapter 1. Side ops require infiltrating the same settlements over and over) make the game a chore at times.  This may all be forgiven if TPP could provide a wonderful narrative to connect the series, and somehow reframe events. Take MGS3 for example. It provided new insight into the characters we had interacted with in MGS1, 2, and even the game, Metal Gear. MGSV adds nothing, absolutely nothing. In fact, it uses the previous games as a crutch for its character development, if it just doesn't just disregard how these characters acted in previous games (looking at you Ocelot). So many scenes in this game don't make any sense, because, at the last moment, the game remembered that this character needs to be alive or something for the next game. Every character is completely one note, with absolutely no twists. Big Boss is a mute. Kaz is angry. Ocelot is a rational encyclopedia. Eli's a brat. Skull Face only cares about revenge. Heck, the only character that has any semblance of character development is the underwear glad Quiet, and she still is a walking contradiction. Is she a licentious gal that just wants to sleep with Big Boss? Is she a brutal, cold, violent murderer that we should be on edge over? Who cares! Show more of her butt to the camera. Even the big twist at the end (which requires a bunch of grinding too unlock, yippee) is full of plotholes and contradictions, creating more questions (and facepalms) than answers. Maybe this is why the game has quotes that tell the player to choose their own canon.  Edit: For some reason, people think this is an amazing PC port. It isn't. The game is capped to 60fps, features no mouse support in the menus, has horrible multi-core support, runs significantly worse on AMD GPUs, features a lot of low-res assets, tons of pop-in, mediocre K&amp;M controls, and has several graphical settings tied to the same changeable setting in-game. The only reason it's praised it because he will almost always run at 60fps when using console settings, which should be the case since it almost always ran at 60fps on the consoles. It's not an amazing port. It's okay, serviceable, but there is a lot to improve",

Sometimes I sprung back, but I realized that i only thought positively of this game after watching a cutscene. And that positive thinking only lasted 1 hour afterwards.  I now believe this game is actually quite terrible. For a war simulator, that gameplay is pretty good. But theres no variety, no matter how many times you swap your weapons out its still the same ♥♥♥♥. Just grind and grind until your mother base teams are level 50 and then for what? the game is too easy after that. the adaptive AI dont do ♥♥♥♥in anything. Just phantom difficulty cuz the game says its difficult. No, the more you go on the more ♥♥♥♥in dudes are at guard posts until theres like 20 guys protecting the middle of nowhere and theres no blindspots.  The game thinks its cute to play stealthy. It offers no cool tricks to stealth around with. You get a box with different posters and camos and a cool item that restricts your mission grade. Doesn't matter, you'll only get S ranks on the lame missions or ♥♥♥♥ you get lucky on. The game wants you to go loud and stay loud. ♥♥♥♥ stealth, shoot everyone you see unless he has good stats. Thats why the tranq pistol exists no other reason.  The story is really bad as well. That ground zeroes cutscene at the end was warped so many fricken times that it is practically The Count of Monte Cristo. Theres 3 versions as far as i know.  SPOILERS (But who gives a ♥♥♥♥)            The three versions I KNOW OF:  1. Normal version: Chopper explodes by Paz jumping out and the bomb going off, killing her and knockin down the chopper and messing up Big Boss (the 'horn' and coma)  2. Paz's version: She lived, they got both bombs out and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ perspective doesnt show that a rocket hit near the cockpit of the helicopter even though it looks like Paz exploded.  3. Medic Version: The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you play as is a ♥♥♥♥ing nobody extra character that was IN FRONT of Big Boss to take the explosion for him, leaving the medic guy hurt and boss with a few bruises.      Terrible perspectives sell.   There's so much wrong with this game it's upsetting. It kicks off slow which is fine, but when it goes it gets going (Nowhere)! Save a prisoner! COOL! He makes prosthetic arms! That sounds useful! ^.^ ok cool! NEXT, save another prisoner. Okay, done, he didn't advance the plot or give any cool intel. Next mission! Kill this guy, he does bad stuff to the people of Afghanistan. Ok wait. Since when do we care? we're out for revenge and now we're doing charity work for people in the region the main villain happens to be in? Why? we only operate there, our base isnt there. Our forces arent there. Nothing is there. Why are main story missions WASTED on saving 9000 prisoners and blowing up 50 tanks and stealing useless junk? there are 200 missions in the game including side missions. Less than 10% of those missions advance the plot. 50 main story missions in total. about 15 are repeats with a twist. Making for forced VR which some players will probably not be able to complete due to difficulty. about 20 are worthless fetch quests and the last 15 are the story. The very loose, poorly made story. With a villain that seems cool at first, but quits halfway through and explains his motives, goes back on them. Gives you praises, stops trying to kill you, picks up his motives again, goes back on them AGAIN, quits again and puts himself in a widely nonsensical situation where he dies on purpose, leaving the most badass man on the planet to play with his cute little robot which is a pushover boss fight because in his mind it'll kill Big Boss the Legendary Solider who stopped World War 3 by himself. He knows you are badass because he explains how he tied those loose ends of you single handedly stopping world war 3. But no, a robot will stop you. DEFINITELY.     END OF SPOILERS    Saving Grace is the gameplay in some aspects. The AI is buggy in the PC port. The PS4 version has much more intelligent AI to the point where its most likely a different scripting system. They are noticably smarter in every way. Especially during combat alerts. When they lose sight of you. They check where you were and where you could've gone. In PC they just check where you were and say, 'Eh ♥♥♥♥ it he died'. But if you shoot them with a silenced weapon from nearly 60 meters out, they know exactly where you are. In the dark or in a sandstorm doesnt matter.  PROS:  +Optimization is great, 60FPS is constant even during intense action scenes. though dust effects from driving cars has huge dips if the camera is angled just right.  +Controls are solid on a gamepad  +Stealth feels mostly believable. AI has some issues as you draw in very close however.  +Plenty of missions  +Mother base is great as is, management is fun and expanding is cool. Platforms are spread out a bit too far for my liking.  CONS:  -Loose plot with strange villains. Not strange in a good way, their motives are so roundabout they could've been doing something else.  -Story could've been more prominent as with every single other metal gear game  -Open world has nothing in it. Could've been linear and would've worked way better.  -PC AI is iffy. Some detections are highly debatable.  -keyboard controls are very poor. Only 2 crouch walking speeds, Normal and slow as balls.  -either consumed by revenge as a character or just being weird, Miller doesn't act like Miller. Making stupid decisions left and right.  -too many convenient plot devices. Especially the one tied to mother base mid game.  -The easily seen coming twist at the end was hardly believable. In my opinion, sucked.  5/10 Doesn't sit right with me, this is the last metal gear, but definitely far from the definitive. I won't say the game overall sucked, just too much of it did where it could've been amazing. a shell of a metal gear, much like the protagonist himself.",

People claim that Act 1 was good but it honestly just seems that way due to how hilariously bad Act 2 is, Act 1 suffers from amazing pacing problems as well and ends really abruptly.  The open world thing is really mismanaged as well, it basically means that there are dozens of mostly identical outposts that you can run between with nothing of note in the glorified corridors between them. I miss the carefully crafted environments from earlier MGS games. The open world only adds padding since it takes so damn long to go anywhere and it takes ages for your the quick travel helicopter to actually move somewhere.  All the missions ends up blending together after a while, take out X, exfiltrate Y. After a few hours you've done pretty much every thing that you will do in the game. Tons of padding missions where you are going after some generic dude that maybe kinda sorta is connected to the main plot. The boss fights are extremely uninspired or not there at all ( the earlier games had amazing last fights but here you get to fight    a generic tank squad? Really?    ).  Harry Gregson-Williams isn't doing the music (only gets a producer credit) in this game and it's unfortunately really obvious, the soundtrack is servicable and all but it's just so damn bland which definitely isn't something you could say about the soundtrack in earlier games.  The actual stealth gameplay is pretty decent but I really don't get how this got 10/10 from so many reviewers. I have zero urge to replay this game after finishing unlike every other main Metal Gear game which I felt that I wanted to play again the moment I finished it.  Then you get into how Kojima and Konami promised that this would cover the gap between the Big Boss games and the Solid Snake ones, but we do not get that at all except for a minute-long epilogue. And why is Ocelot such a boring character who only exists to exposition dump when he has so much personality in all the other games he's in, both before and after this one?

I suggest you wait for a price drop There is an online mode and I haven't played it and frankly-I don't want to.   PROS: Nice graphics  Controls Customized soundtrack  Cons: Ganeplay is repetitious and gets boring really quickly  The 'open world' is plain and dull The A,I. is dumb Can't turn off the radio or turn off sounds-so you'll always hear the guards saying the same thing in Russian over and over again.  Characters are boring  Story is kind of all over the place  Mother base is too big and there is almost nothing to do there   I don't know if it had to do with the internal problems at Konami, budget problems with the game (maybe because the hired Keifer Sutherland) I have to say: the voice acting was good; though again, it repeats itself allot and it's all very one-sided.  There are also a lot of scenes that are unskippable and will repeat over and over again.   One has to wonder, if at some point, the dev team decided to use The Flinstones trick. One also wonders if Kojima had his name removed from the title, maybe because of embarrassment. There are a lot of good ideas here but they seem poorly excecuted Again, maybe it's because they ran out of money or maybe there was a clash of ideas.

You can be stealthful or run and gun/kill everyone and with little consequence   The game also allows you to regenerate your health in about 15 seconds. when you're near death. People have complained about this; but given that getting spotted results on a sworm of guards. jumps all over you like horny dog humping your leg: I can see why that was put there. There was one visual that I find particularly annoying: Boss has a large piece of shrapnal, sticking out of his head for the entire game-I get it: it'a symbolic, it represents 'the demon' but it still annoys me.

It is the next true evolution in the Metal Gear Solid franchise in terms of gameplay and tactical stealth (or guns blazing if you're that boring). Every new mission that is started is another tale to be told because nothing ever, EVER goes the same way twice. The AI is some of the best I have ever encountered in a video game, while bending to some levels of absurdity just so certain gameplay devices can work. Audio is also masterfully done, even though there's a total lack of options in-game.   But I have to not recommend this game to any longtime Metal Gear fan, who will obviously be expecting heavy heaps of story, just not as much as MGS4. This game has two wrong things with it. Two very big wrong things. Not only is it actually an unfinished game - with the latter half composing almost entirely of filler missions - but the quality Metal Gear cutscenes and story we've come to expect were either cut entirely out or moved to cassette tapes. There are some cutscenes that are incredible, no joking, but there is a definite lack of them. You will acquire a huge amount of story cassette tapes over the course of the game, when they could have just served as cutscenes instead. Indeed, Keifer Sutherland does a good job as Venom Snake, but fails to deliver any lines where they would really be needed, and by that I mean he is a silent protagonist for more than half the game. The main story also takes a nosedive into nothing once the first chapter is completed. There are only three main missions in chapter 2 that actually progress the story. The rest are harder versions of chapter 1 missions. Then you get the final mission and it's just over.  This game was truly made for non-hardcore fans of the series, in terms of gameplay and structure. Perhaps story as well, because gameplay is just absolutely everywhere, you cannot complain. I would recommend this game if that were the only case, but in reality, the game is incomplete. Chapter 1 ends like it was the end of the entire game. It should have probably stayed that way, with how Chapter 2 stretches itself out and ends.  I actually do recommend this game if it's on sale and you're a noob to the Metal Gear series. It's a load of fun and perfects the 'fun' parts, but also removes what series veterans have come to expect from this franchise. This game is the most playable in the entire series, but even Ground Zeroes had a better story than this, and that game could be played normally at two hours.",

Its hype was a fallacy. The whole idea that one even needs compare it to the previous games to think it's bad is also a fallacy. The truth is, even as a standalone title its story line isn't finished. There's baring examples of cut content. Chapter 1 was ended abrubtly, chapter 2 hardly existed (you had to replay chapter 1 missions on hard lol), and it has a lot of really sexist themes (the main female character in the game writhing on the ground at your base in a bikini in the rain.)

Long story short: Your Forward Operating Base is what allows you to expand your base, get people, and thereby progress through the game a bit easier. You get unlocks and upgrades through this system as well as a host of other gameplay features. The entire single-player game revolves around Mother Base, your FOBs, and your army.   Problem is that other players can invade your FOB and steal your people. They can do this even while you are offline. You are practically forced to participate because many of the unlocks and upgrades require a certain Security Team level, which only comes from having an FOB. So, if you want to enjoy the single-player, you have to subject yourself to other players taking your building resources and people.   There is an 'offline mode' but all this does is delay the inevitable, as you will immediate receive the effects of any player invading your FOB (taking your people/resources) the next time you log in. Which, by the way, you have to do in order to upgrade your FOB in the first place, and if you don't you hamstring your own progression.   TL;DR - FOBs are an online mode that you must use to get the full experience but doing so impacts your single player experience in a pretty significant way.   For that reason, I do not recommend this game until they get it fixed. No game, especially one stemming from a primarily Single Player franchise, should ever be impacted by other players when you are not able to contribute to your own defense.",

The game just feels like a slap dash of missions that are really hit or miss with often tedious additional mission tasks that should have never been added. The controls are pretty solid even on keyboard and mouse. The graphics are well done and the game was actually optimized for a Japanese game. The gameplay its self is once again like its missions, hit or miss since this game is mission based instead being a large connected area you progress through in previous games. The mission variety is usually go here blow a man, go here blow a man's stuff, go here and take a man, go here and fight a boring boss, go here and follow a man, or go here and steal ♥♥♥♥. The mission rankings are I swear only based on time seeing as kills and alerts really don't penalise you in the end. The story might as well not of happened, and it's major villain is easily forgotten for a far more awful person who betrays you. The characters are all pretty boring, they someonw how made Ocelot boring in this game, Quiet is just weird wank material, and Keifer Sutherland is kinda of boring as Big Boss/Venom Snake. Also the online might as well not of existed in this game. If you are a fan of MGS go ahead and play this game, but if you are new to the series, just go and play any other MGS.",

However here are my issues:   The characters are ♥♥♥♥. Kaz basically has a personality that's been written by an angsty 15 year old boy. Every single piece of dialogue he's said so far in the ♥♥♥♥in 40 hours I've put into the game is absolute cringe. Let's not even talk about Quiet who is essentially a fleshlight with a gun.  Every single mission is pretty much the same thing. Sneak into this generic outpost with generic guards who do exactly the same thing every time. Very, very quickly this becomes really boring. It didn't matter how I did it, sneak in, run in and punch everybody into unconsciousness, shoot the place up, shoot the place up with rockets, everything was very quickly dull as ♥♥♥♥.  The game is far, far, far too long. I sunk 40 hours into it, and they were still introducing mechanics. It's like come on, if you haven't got a solid system to work with by the 10 hour mark then you're just throwing utensils at the player and hoping one sticks as fun.  The story is non-existent and whatever pieces of story you actually get are basically just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t buzzwords about rubbish that is incomprehensible if you haven't been jotting every stray acronym down in a jotter.  Snake might as well have been voiced by an actual snake because the tiny amount of dialogue he gets is laughable, and the actual breadth of emotion used by Sutherland (who is an otherwise good actor) might as well have been a guide on how to act like a piece of driftwood.  The free roaming. Yay! I've always wanted a Grand Metal Theft Solid Auto! Thank christ they had the ability to copy and paste otherwise the map might have been one single town and one very small piece of flooring.  tl;dr: MGSV ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, it's boring, badly written, with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters whose personalities could be summed up on a sticky note and what would have otherwise been a lacklustre game (if it was 20 hours long) seems to have been stretched thin across enough time wasting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that it'll suck 100 hours out of you.

The past MGS had me love the story, love the characters(I actually cried about some deaths), and actually care about beating the game, the long cutscenes were actually good for the gameplay's health, the story and world, and MGS5 fails miserably at doing ANY of this.  Sure, you CAN tell a story and have it feel meaningful without a ton of long cutscenes, but that's the thing, MGS5 has no story at all. The story is uncaring for its own self and feels nonexistant, and as a resuilt failed to keep me caring, thing is the story and all the characters seem uncaring for their own selves as well. The gameplay is good for a short while, but with a world and story that feels.. so disconnected, and dead, it's impossible for me to feel like that playing the game doesn't feel utterly pointless, and eventually the gameplay feels stale, and depressing. YOu could have fun infiltrating bases for hours, but the upgrades you get also destroy half the point of the gameplay this game TRIED to achieve.  There's not much more to say about this game.. which is actually pretty depressing and also another point. There isn't much more about this game to say. It's a game with a dead world and story that ignores itself with characters that feel so disconnected from everything.  If you love MGS, ignore this game, it will hurt you.

            "review_text": "I didn't rike it.  A lot of people decry Konami for ruining this game, but it's clear to me that while Konami maliciously shut this game down because Kojima slept with somebody's wife or took a ♥♥♥♥ on the floor, it was Kojima himself that ruined MGSV.  I've been a huge Metal Gear fan for a long time, but playing this game was like watching someone ten meters from the finish line of a marathon slip on a banana peel, spill coffee all over himself, trip over a railing, fall down a flight of stairs, then get hit by a subway train.  First of all, the gameplay mechanics are incredible. It feels like Kojima took the best elements from every stealth game and sewed them into a beautiful tapestry. The controls are silky smooth and very responsive. The gameplay systems that complement the controls, like the stealth, enemy interaction, and unique features such as reflex mode, are very well designed. Kojima really knocked it out of the park with the core gameplay, but the content that puts that gameplay to use is where he stumbled.  MGSV is so unnecessarily repetitive. All of the small towns/enemy bases spread across the game's two maps are exceptionally well designed, but the game's insistence on making you return to those same locations several times each is what dulls the experience.  There are 157 side missions in the game, and they all kind of blur into one by the end. One series of side missions is called 'Extract the Highly-Skilled Soldier', where you have to sneak into an enemy base or outpost and extract a specially-marked enemy back to your Mother Base. The problem is that there are 16 'Extract the Highly-Skilled Soldier' missions that have you infiltrate bases and outposts you've already infiltrated countless times. What's worse, is that there's another series of side missions called 'Prisoner Extraction' that has you infiltrate bases and outposts you've already been to, where you need to... find a specially-marked prisoner and extract them back to your Mother Base. There are 20 of these missions. Even a different side mission series like 'Eliminate the Armored Vehicle Unit' will pit you against a collection of armored vehicles and enemy soldiers, and you will inevitably extract all of them back to Mother Base, because, well, that's how the game wants you to play.  MGSV gives you so much freedom to approach any scenario how you want, but at the same time, the game is also designed to encourage you to play one very specific and limiting way. In order to have a thriving Mother Base, you need skilled soldiers which predominantly can only be acquired by extracting them back to your base during a mission. So even though the game allows you to take a very brash, lethal approach, you end up feeling forced to play a completely different way. I would have loved to play through the whole game as stealthily as possible, slipping through the enemy ranks without giving them any indication I was there at all, but instead I approached every base and outpost the same way: mark every enemy from a distance; tranq them or sneak up and choke them one by one; then extract them back to my base until the guard post is empty. The restrictive nature of this gameplay becomes very tiring, and it was only after I had completed the large majority of the game and had my Mother Base R&amp;D team develop every weapon and item I thought I might need to complete the rest of the game, that I was able to open up my gameplay style and start killing or ignoring guards if I wanted to.  Somewhere along the way Kojima decided to shift from a linear, simplified experience where you sneak through one long mission comprised of unique and interesting areas that are punctuated with entertaining story cutscenes, and go more toward a disjointed and stat-heavy game. Many times, it didn't feel like I was playing an MGS game so much as managing finances in accounting software. Rather than trying to create a fun and memorable game, it seems like Kojima (and/or Konami's influence, perhaps) tried to make the game as addictive as possible. There were many times playing the game where I felt like I was having fun, but I realized that what I found 'fun' was spotting an S-ranked soldier with my binoculars. This made me understand that I wasn't having fun at all, but that instead, spotting this S-rank fired off the OCD triggers in my brain that are at the core of every addictive behavior. It's experiences like this that sour my opinion of the current state of the game industry. Imagine how much better it would have been to sneak through an entire game made up of unique areas as well designed as the mission from Ground Zeroes, without all the useless stats.  The Mother Base system is a shining example of everything that's wrong with MGSV. You spend all of your time grinding by extracting soldiers back to your base and building it up. But for what? You can assign the soldiers you acquire to different units at your base, like Combat, Research &amp; Development, Intel, Medical, etc., and each unit has different responsibilities that they carry out. But when you take a step back and look at all of it, most of it does nothing useful. The Combat team can be sent out on automatic missions that happen in the background and return with materials. The Medical team will patch up any Combat team soldiers that were wounded on their missions so they can go on more missions and acquire more materials. So what are materials used for? Well, you use them to build additions to your Mother Base so that you can have more soldiers per unit, which in turn will increase the level of each unit and allow them to acquire even more materials so you can... ??? Hopefully you're understanding the useless cycle that this creates. In fact, the only unit at your base that matters at all is the R&amp;D unit which is responsible for developing every weapon and piece of equipment that you can use in the game. Rather than the good old procure-on-site method of collecting weapons in previous MGS games, this game requires you to painstakingly knock out and extract every enemy in sight, regardless of how you want to play, so that you can go through the whole Mother Base rigamarole to upgrade your R&amp;D unit so they can develop the weapons/items you want/need.  The story was a real letdown too. A lot of people complain that Konami caused the final mission to be cut from the game, but even if you watch the unfinished version of that mission on YouTube, it still doesn't add a satisfying conclusion. The game literally has no ending. You know it's over because it stops giving you missions. There wasn't even a final boss fight. There was a particular plot/character I thought this game was going to revolve around, but it didn't really even touch on it. It doesn't feel like a bridge between MGS3 and Metal Gear; it just feels like a meandering side story. Many semi-interesting plot threads fizzle out with no explanation. Characters like Ocelot don't even seem related to themselves from other games. The last time Snake and Ocelot saw each other, they were in a fistfight on a plane, and at the start of this game, Ocelot shows up with no explanation and is apparently Snake's best buddy. Character actions and motivations feel vague and fluid in this game, and answers to questions only provide confusion and plot holes.  MGSV had the potential to be the coolest game ever made. The gameplay mechanics, systems and level design are all top notch. The graphics are fantastic and the cutscene direction and camera work are the best I've ever seen in a game. Just slick as hell. Unfortunately, the frustrating repetition, lack of meaningful game and story content, and the mind-numbing stat management all bring this game down. If Kojima had patterned this game a little more like MGS3, it might have truly been something special. If you want the most satisfying MGSV experience, just save your money and watch the E3 2015 trailer and imagine what could have been.",

Did not know that Open-World means '4 Small Villages with 5 to 10 Enemies with 50000 KM empty desert between them'.   The prologue was promising (to be honest I found the prologue too long and it was basically just one giant cut scene. But it was still more fun than the rest), but everything after that wasn't fun at all. I have more fun playing Euro Truck Simulator than this.  You spend more time on your horse riding between missions than actually doing them.  Guard posts which you once captured are magically filled with enemies again if you leave and come back at a different time. Same goes for those 4 Villages which are used for the side missions.  I just don't want to play in this landscape. It's really, really, really... boring...  I got the feeling that too much work got into this abonimation of 'Mother Base' which is quite, well, overwhelming at first, but I rather had more diverse missions and landscapes than Farmville with Weapon Upgrades.  If you're not a 3rd person guy, don't buy it. I normally hate 3rd person games (besides Uncharted and The Last Of Us), because nobody manages to get the feel of the controls so that it does not feel like you're playing with noodle-controls. Everything feels just so.... noodly... I can't describe it. It's not snappy, it lags behind, the character turns like an idiot, the horse handles like a train.  And what is up with jumping? Why can't I jump? Why does he always do a superman and land on the floor crawling like a total jerk?   I should probably play this with a controller, but I can't....  TLDR:  Boring landscape, boring missions, no sound options (no volume adjustment... seriously?1!!!1), no mouse for menus (and therefore odd controls for almost everything which is kinda like a menu e.g. iDroid), the avatar you create in the beginning isn't even used (probably not fully implemented?), no jumping, random recoil  Yet another bad console port.

However make no mistake this is not for anybody who did not enjoy ground zeroes and its 'extra content' for reference I do enjoy ground zeroes' extra content, but I bought ground zeroes on sale. But if you got annoyed that ground zeroes made you play the same map a couple times... well get ready because this game makes you play the same map several times as well. LIke I said the gameplay is polished to a mirror shine and you're generally always unlocking something new for the first few hours of gamplay, but missions get repeated so if you think going back to a mission area with new gear and restrictions isn't extra gameplay and will annoy you, this game will annoy you if that is the case.  And then there are other things, Forward operating bases that other players can sabotage, microtransactions for a game thats already 60$.

            "review_text": "The game is flat-out not finished. No, not like Assassin's Creed Unity or some early-access indie schlock. The control is great, in around 60 hours of gameplay I haven't experienced a single glitch, and (for the most part) what we have here is a fun, functional, and fair game.  So what's wrong? Metal Gear is a series we love for its story. The story in this game is garbage. It's split into 2 chapters, chapter one being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ drawn out story that feels like it was pulled out of a Call of Duty campaign, and then stretched out from the usual 5-6 hours of a CoD game, to the 30-40 hours you'll spend running around Hyrule Field-I mean Afghanistan and Central Africa. Chapter 2 gives you about twice the story in about a quarter of the time, and then abrubtly ends, leaving huge gaps in the plot. Some of these holes could have been filled by the cut 51st mission, which the only way to 'experience' it is to watch the video included with the collector's edition. Even then, I guess we're just supposed to make assumptions about what happens from now until Metal Gear 1 on the MSX2.  Within the first 10 missions you'll realize what's really going on here. Most of the time, you'll be running around either a desert or a jungle looking for a specific person to kill, attach a balloon to, or carry away. Kojima said that we would be able to play the missions in any order, and the story would still make sense. Unfortunately, the way that they accomplished this was by making most of the 'story' missions not actually impact the story at all, whatsoever. Not only that, but of the 50 main missions in the game, 12 of them are just hard mode repeats of old missions.  Chapter 1 is 31 missions. Chapter 2 is 7 missions. What is even the point of having a second chapter?  People have datamined a titlecard for the 3rd chapter, but we would have found it by now. Mission 51 wouldn't be cut if there was more.   We play Metal Gear for a great single player experience, but MGSV's single player was rushed and gutted in order to make room for the online multiplayer elements. Clash of Clans style base building, complete with pay-to-win micro-transactions for extra base-building space and base insurance, not to mention the recent costume DLC. And mind you, PC players don't even get Metal Gear Online (the main multiplayer portion of the game) until January, despite the fact that console players have had it for about half a month now.  The longer you get into this game, the more you realize how awful it really is. As the missions get unbearably unfair (A Quiet Exit being the worst offender, the only story mission I haven't beaten), and the plot degrades into a series of anecdotal one-offs that lead nowhere, you become cynical enough that it doesn't matter that Keifer Sutherland is yelling 'ROCKET PUNCH!' and using balloons to send animals into the sky.  The game might as well be a dream (which is actually a theory some people have) because everything that happens is eventually revealed to be either a complete fabrication, a hallucination, or just entirely inconsequential to the series as a whole.  That said, this is by far the best open world game ever made. Everything you do affects your base, your soldiers, your private army's morale, resources, and global influence.  Unfortunately, it's the worst Metal Gear game ever made, and because of that, I absolutely cannot recommend it.",

Keyboard and mouse controls feel, for the most part, like they were made by someone who doesn't use these input devices for extended periods of playtime.   The story... let's just say I didn't even realise it was over - in part because of the 'end credits' after every single mission fetish.   Playing as base staff is an appreciated feature, but I ended up playing through the whole game as a female R&amp;D specialst with really low grades - appearantly their stats will increase by +1 after 3 S-ranked missions, but only  once  - because by the time i got other female prisoners I had grown so attached to the way she looked and the sound of her voice, that switching her out was just impossible for my sentimental self.

You could turn BB into a younger guy and call the game far cry 5 and everybody would say it's a repetitive POS. Most of the budget was thrown at Stephanie Joosten and Kiefer Sutherland and marketing in general, and almost nothing went into gameplay , and even less into cutscenes and actual story.  Every. mission. is.the . same. Absolutely all of them are you sneaking into an outpost and fultoning someone out. The AI is far worse and unpredictable than it has ever been in any MGS game. I've no idea how they made it this bad considering how good it was in 3 &amp; 4.  The open world is useless . There are no random events. Almost 0 fauna . No civilians, no life between enemies . They barely talk at all . All guns are the same . There's no face camo , only a handful of outfits .  Quiet is a walking sex doll with no justification : the reasons for her being half naked all the time is pure BS.  The only time she surprises the player is totally hilarious and stupid. The story is OK, but it totals to not even a tenth of the game , contrary to MGS4 that was more of an interactive movie than a game . And the ending was cut out due to time restrictions.  Everything in it feels lifeless and meaningless , aside from a few good MGS moments .  I don't regret buying it , I just regret what it could have been if konami didn't ♥♥♥♥ up so massively. Removing the open world part to make the game more lively would have been five thousand times better. To sum up :   Pros :  Good gameplay Good graphics Customization and development add a lot to the game Some moments of the game will give you chills from how brutal they are compared to usual MGS stuff Companions are a nice touch Being able to choose your character is nice  Cons :  Near inexistant story that is meaningless anyway HORRIBLE online experience Even more lifeless than far cry 2 Excessively stupid AI Incredibly repetitive gameplay Too much waiting  IN GAME TRANSACTIONS IN A SINGLE PLAYER GAME",

However I feel this game is a horrible excuse for a Metal Gear game as it's quality has fallen immensly from the previous ones.  There's a lot of nothing in between areas, making traveling feel like padding, more so when there's the unskippable chopper scenes. The enemies feel like their AI is more stupid than previous games and the biggest threat to getting caught is more enemies in ONE location. It makes all other outposts next to nothing in difficulty to capture as they divert troops to assist the base you're assaulting, taking away from the challenge.   The base management seems worse than Peacewalker as nothing feels important about it. Building up mother base in peacewalker felt like a HUGE deal, getting new gear felt like an achievement and it felt like it took time. In this game it's more of an afterthought. Rebuilding mother base should have been something amazing, more so you can explore it. However you only explore the exterior for the entirety of it save a few exceptions.   Overall I can say this game is decent, but a previous one does better in every instance.  It feels REALLY rushed and doesn't feel like it's up to snuff with Hideo's best work.  Update: I played MGO so heres my review of this one! Worse than MGS4, hardly anyone plays AT ALL. Yes unlike MGO2 you can find matches quicker but it's always with the same group. The lack of drebin points means you get no real reward for playing well, instead you get this silly loadout system. Good in theory but I liked the perks from MGO2. This game suffers from MAJOR lag. You can get a perfect headshot and still die from them because the game says 'Nope, no good service for you.' Might have something to do with the fact no one plays so it pairs you to foreigners. I have yet to see some one with good ping. I'm spending money on the best internet so it certainly isn't on our end. Let alone people who've wasted hours in the game get explosive launchers, IE they always win because the blast radius is way over the top and deals 1/3 of your health, plus stunning you. Making it so they can stun lock you to death. In other words, screw this game mode.",

I can remember playing the boss battle against ocelot in MGS where he goes into detail about the single action army, I'm pretty sure (it's the only game I've played once, maybe twice) where again Solid Snake tells Raiden about the inner workings of his gun. I'm pretty sure Raiden gets his pistol field stripped by him.  MGS 3: Snake goes into detail about the slide mechanism and reliability of the M1911, SIGNT (you know when you had a codec) tells you all about the new weapons you pick up. MGS4: Drebin tells snake all about the inner workings of the M4A1 (Also the graphics were better, shells sat on the ground for a long time, even from enemies, you could see right into the M4's bolt on reloading. Peace walker: Weapons are given their proper designations and a short description to go with them, since MGS has always straddled SCI-FI and reality when I saw the Kampfpistole I had to look it up as I was sure it wasn't a real thing. The kampfpistole is in this but with some strange designation. Funniest thing is that if you look at it in detail it's still 'RB MickeyMouse 44' on the R&amp;D screen but when you get to the detailed description &lt;silly designation here&gt;  Kampf Pistole  it makes no sense.  - No long mission briefings with Kaz... um Miller, basically it's just 'go here, do that; got it?' Before you both talked about the mission and what you might encounter. Nothing like that here.  - No codec. I can understand the lack of long codec conversations on a mobile platform like the PSP/Vita but no codec in a PC/PS3?/4/XBOX game makes zero sense. When I get to a base I should be able to codec call my support team, my intel team and find out about the base, when shifts change, where weaknesses are.  - COD style jam on screen health system. What happened to rations? Again a staple of the MGS franchise. What happened to food? Why can I get my sneaking suit so early and basically take full auto shots while running at an enemy to knock him out, fulton him then knock the next guy out? Why is the sneaking suit more like full kevlar armour than a sneaking suit; all it does when it comes to 'sneaking' is muffle your footprints.  Even when I tried modding the weapon names back to normal the mod was quickly changed back.  Do I recommend this game to MGS fans who've played pretty much every game in the series? No Do I recommend it to someone who just wants to shoot at stuff, get shot back and never worry about running out of health; sure.",

            "review_text": "So I recently finished the story for the game. And I have been a big fan of the MGS series ever since the first one for PS1. I have not played the first two MG games for NES or the psp games, but I have seen the story via videos on the net.  The good points are as following:  + Gameplay is pretty solid, pun intended :P The CQC is greatly improved, the gun combat and the movement is also greatly improved over previous games. So this is where the game truly shines is on gameplay and that is the core gameplay. All the gear and assets you can use are mostly great, especially the buddy system and there are lots of ways to play and do missions.  + The graphics are stellar and on PC it is very well optimized. To have it look this well and run at 60fps all the time is really great for a multi platform game.   The Middle Ground  +/- + Story presentation. When the story is presented to you through cutscenes it is some of the best directed cutscenes you will ever see in a game. They are beautifully made and very engaging. The bad part of the story presentation is that there are way to few cutscenes that tells the story, most of the story is told through cassette tapes and it gets so tiresome listening to all of them. I wish some of the important stuff had been presented through some sort of cutscene or at least in a better way than through tapes. Why not something similar to the codec moments in previous games, not a fix, but at least it would have been better.  The bad  - The story itself is to me very lackluster and very sparse. Which is to me a huge minus for this series. I have always loved the stories in these games and the amount of cutscenes have never been an issue for me. It seems they traded gameplay for story and that is just not good for a MGS game. It feels unfinished, the ending comes out of nowhere, and I hear there is even a whole chapter that has been cut out of the game.  - Big Boss as a character.... is boring... He has no character, he barely speaks and I have no idea why on earth they had to change the voice actor as the facial motion capture is most of the time not noticeable, since he almost never speaks. Most of his dialogue is once again through boring tapes. Jack Bauers delivery is not bad, it is just and unnecessary change, I have no doubts that David Hayter could have done just as good a job on the facial motion capture.   - To many silent characters. Big Boss, enemy bosses, Quiet (though she should be quiet), Eli has so few lines or never even says anything, making their characters boring and just not that important really. They are just there, they don't add much to the story.  - Chapter 2 is poorly designed, with most of the missions just being the same missions from chapter 1, just with new challenges added to them. The story missions has to be unlocked by doing certain stupid criterias. The ending comes out of nowhere and has no build up. It feels like a whole chunk of the game is missing.  - Mother Base is annoying as hell and mostly pointless. There is not much to do there besides the silly MP mode, some cutscenes plays out and there are a few collectibles and secrets. But to have such a detailed part of the game be pretty much useless is just stupid. You have to upgrade it by pretty much grinding resources and fulton staff from the open world to upgrade and unlock new weapons. And you have to even wait for 30+ minutes to unlock items, which is really annoying when you are going on a mission and just wanted to unlock a new tool for that mission.  - Lack of some stealth mechanics that are sorely missed. Why can't I shoot the radios anymore, that was so handy in the previous games, and shooting someone in the leg or the hand does nothing, while even in MGS that made them either unable to use their weapon or walk slowly and actually get handicapped.  So to end this review I have to both recommend and not recommend it, unfortunally I can't do a middle ground on this game on a steam review so I will go with a not recommended rating. There are just way to many negatives for me to hartly recommend it, especially for other MGS fans. But for people who don't even care about the story, then I do recommend it because of the rock solid core gameplay which will keep you entertained for a long time. But this game feels unfinished and just lacking that which all the previous MGS games has had and that is the epic and satisfying cinematic story.",

It touches dark subject matter then immediately turns 180 degrees. Where is the 'Taboo', the dark elements of the game that was promised in the trailers, interviews and et cetera. Most of the storyline are told through cassette tapes, which couldve been amazing cutscenes. When does 'Snake' become a 'demon'?  One of the missions, was very emotionally powerful. You get the sense that Venom Snake is going on his downward spiral to demonhood, but he never does. He's just a characterless, morally 'good guy' throughout the whole game. Hideo Kojima, the game director, even told that he wanted to make a dark character, but someone we could feel bad for, and understand, - like Walter White from Breaking Bad.   The only thing i really loved about this game was the intro, really, really well executed. Voiceacting was also superb.  Several of the themes are never fully realized. There was much potencial with child soliders, but it never went anywhere after the missions were done. The story is way too sparse to the point where all the events feel disconnected from one another. The game is litterally unfinished, most of the missions were somewhat irrelevant, just extract this, or do something else.   The only characters that got a conclusion is the main antagonist, 'Skullface', and Quiet, which is optional. The main characters don't really do anything, they are just at motherbase doing nothing. I don't really care about sexualization of the character 'Quiet', but at least write her better than this. She's boring, and really unnecessary. Skullface is also rushed, had potencial.  The biggest ♥♥♥♥ you to the fans was the 'secret ending'. It doesn't make sense. It feels like It's just a twist, for the sake of being a twist.   Spoilers: The twist was that you're the Medic from GZ. In MGS4, Big Boss tells Old Snake; 'you eliminated me 2 times before'. What the ♥♥♥♥. And the thirst of revenge on Big Boss, because he left him to make a better and heaven by his own vision? What the ♥♥♥♥. There was so much potencial, the cutscenes and dialogue was mostly beautiful. Skullface could've been the real big boss for example, or just an poetic symbol of someone he is becoming. The game could've ended in the shoes of Solid Snake, killing off Big Boss because of his madness - recreating the original Metal Gear.   In conclusion: ♥♥♥♥ this game. It's an unfinished mess, that deserves less praise than it gets.",

The first appearance of skulls makes you scratch the head. Then starting from the middle of the game you can practically feel how it goes downhill, how badly action part of this game designed and how little boss battles suit this game.  EDIT2: Oh, the folks in other reviews are complaining about the story. Let me say it straight: this game has no story at all. No. Zero. Period. Even Angry Birds have more plot. There are no memorable characters except probably from the Quiet, no depth, no memorable bosses (except the brief fight with the Quiet and Ch1 endfight). You want your FOX squad? AHAHA, FAT CHANCE. The half of the game barely have any story missions. There is even no ending.

I loved the game for first 20h, at 40h I was afraid that it's over and there was nothing more. But there is more, more reused content. Stuff that would be optional in any other open world game here is mandatory to actually see the ending. Game claims to have 50 main missions which is a lie since 20 of them are just old missions on higher difficulty or new generic missions in same place where there already were 2-3 other missions + 10 side ops. Not to even mention that almost every single ♥♥♥♥ing mission is the same because it's all tied to mother base horrible grind for mostly pointless weapons upgrades. So you either have to extract something or kill/destroy someone/somebody but since you still can extract it and it's always better you will do this anyway. Level design is generally great and stealth mechanics are great but at some point it just become repeating same pasterns over and over again especially when you repeat infiltration of same base 5th+ time. Story is excellent so far, but Big Boss isn't really the boss anywhere. He just does as he is told and rarely even speak let alone makes any decision. Story pacing is also watered down by all open world stuff you often have to do or just travelling long distances. There is quick travel but it's hidden so well I haven't found it until 50h in the game and it doesn't hive any tips to it until you find first cargo ramp. So for most travelling you will call chopper that cost your in game money slowing down you grind a bit, in fact it charges you money so often I don't even want to use support features and change my loadout to anything that isn't optimal. In fact game charges you even for ammo drops given to you AUTOMATICALLY during the boss fight. Codec conversations have been reduced to minimum as well, you can get a tip every now and then, mission instructions a short fact about an animal. That's all, they are hardly a conversations at all, Boss doesn't talk most of the time and the whole thing isn't even close to masterpiece conversations in MGS3. At the moment I can't unlock mission 43 for unknown reason and sure as hell I won't waste my time on replaying old missions on higher difficulty which are only ones I have available or do more samy side ops to do it so I'll see rest of the game on youtube. I really wish it was over at 40h when I was still able to ignore most of the game's flaws. That would be a disappointment but now it's a disgrace and huge ♥♥♥♥ing waste of time.",

CONS      The biggest problem is how repetitive this game is! Holy s**t you do the same exact thing over and over and over again. Take over this base, rescue a prisoner I don't care about, destroy this vehicle, destroy that vehicle. End of the game? NOPE, chapter two is a carbon copy of chapter one so you have to play the same boring missions again. All of the missions are in the same exact spot.  The story is pretty much nonexistent, I don't even know what happened in the game. I must have been expecting the game to end because the credits are closing after every mission!  The PC controls are garbage, the PC version was designed with a Xbox controller in mind.  There are pretty much 0 cutscenes in the game, Kojima went from to many cutscenes to none at all.

Graphics - medium at best (considering what is possible) Open World - very empty, no signs of war (there are no dynamic battles between conflict parties or anything like that) Gameplay - the porting from consoles is very weak, otherwise you really have the freedom to choose how you're going to play, but since the AI is not smart at all - it is way easier to simply gun down a complete outpost - nevertheless it makes no difference at all, you can capture outposts and strip them of their resources but its not like you or another party would control them from then on - if you come back there are simply new enemy soldiers",

The single player campaign is tied to the online servers, because a lot of your inventory is stored online (for some purpose that I have not been able to figure out.) If those servers go offline (as they seem to do at least once a week), that inventory becomes unavailable. Now, I could even live with that, but, a lot of your CASH is also tied up online, and, if the server goes offline, that cash becomes unavailable -- which means you start suffering negative effects from being in the red, even if you have plenty stuck online on a server somewhere.  That design decision means that it doesn't matter how good you are at base management - if the servers go offline, you're done. At best, you're at a point where you can turn off the game and not play it until the online servers are back up, so you suffer minimal ill effects. At worst, your base suffers, people leave, you can't buy that support you need to finish a mission, etc.   Tying a single player game to online servers in such a way that their availability cripples your ability to play the single player game is such a bad decision, and it's enough for me to swing me to no on this game, even though the game itself has been fun so far.",

The F2P/MMO cancer infests every Grade 3+ Weapon and Item, every Mother Base Platform, every Forward Operating Base platform, every Combat Deployment, in Single Player and Multi-player.   When you pay Konami to shut off a Wait Wall, you are not paying Konami to do any work. You are paying Konami for PERMISSION for your computer to shut off the Wait Wall, to use the content you already paid for. It's Wait Wall Extortion.  The missions and side ops are treadmills for grinding the resources to feed the wait wall that will extort money from you so you can have permission to unlock your content now instead of upto 8+ days from now, even in Single Player.  MGSV:TPP is an F2P/MMO cancer infesting an interactive comic book. It's like a Single Player game with toll booths that let you wait it out or pay for the Permission to move along.  MGSV:TPP has added an online connection to Single Player, which is as useful for Single Player as a third hand growing out of one's posterior. The Single Player does with the online connection and F2P/MMO cancer (wait walls, virtual currency [Mother Base Coins], treadmills, and farming) the same thing that any other Single Player game has done better for the past 30+ years without any of that F2P/MMO pollution getting in the way of Single Player.  The story is interesting. Various game mechanics are fun. The graphics and audio are great. But, the game play and story are ruined by the parasitic F2P cancer that Konami has forced onto the game.  I consider this game a throw away experience best avoided because it tries to get you to spend your life on it's treadmill, paying to unlock what you already paid $60 for, even in Single Player.",

The intro took way too ♥♥♥♥ing long, should've, and COULD'VE, just been a skippable custscene, it starts off poorly where there's a metric ♥♥♥♥ton of cutscenes that don't even try to entertain you, then you make a character? for some reason? you still play as snake so there's literally no purpose to its inclusion.

It appears to be completely optomised for controller despite having a fairly important shooting compontnent. I had a bit of a time getting used to the controls.  2. The storytelling makes *no sense at all.* It's extremely surreal, and has no internal consistency or logic to the storytelling. To be fair, I had not played previous Metal Gear games and was not expecting an experience filled with bizarr logicless actions one after the other. Nothing makes sense to me in the first 2 hours.

That's the first hour and a half of Metal Gear Solid V. It's so unbelievably boring, I actually found myself staring at my watch. No joke, for the first 10 minutes of the game, you can move your head. Nothing else. For the next 20, you can crawl...you don't even get to choose which direction you crawl...you just crawl.  You may read this and think, surely he's exaggerating... but I cannot prepare you enough. It is, without exaggeration or hyperbole, the most boring hour and a half of any game I have ever played (More boring than waiting for other players to joing a game for a multiplayer mission on a server that has only 2 players.)  Now, let's talk about the story so far. Any game, movie, book, theater show, etc. is going to have the idea of Willing Suspense of Disbelief where you know it's not real and wouldn't work, but you forego that to enjoy the story. If the story is good enough, you won't care if gravity is pointing up. This game ignores that. That first hour and a half has so many plot holes, so many implausible and unbelievalbe aspects that you will wish the main character had died because otherwise, you can't buy into the world at all.  FInally, this is a port over. A very, very bad port. So bad, that even if you open the menu to look for control commands (the menu is not mouse compatible) the ONLY controls listed are for a console controller.  I've only played 2 hours of this game, however I hope I can save at least one person $60 bucks. I would rather play a video game interpretation of a Jane Austin novel than launch this game again.",

I know Metal Gear tends to have supernatural themes, but it just seems way too much.   I don't know if that is what the rest of the game is like as I have only completed the first part of the Afghanistan mission, up to the helicopter extraction.

            "review_text": "Metal Gear Broken 3 is finally out, and I can finally review this game as whole. Let's do it (at this point, it sounds like those review videos on YouTube, hehe):  Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain: PROS: The game is gorgeous, it looks good, it plays good, gameplay mechanics are awesome, a lot of gadgets to experiment with. Combining multiple gadgets will let you see how enemy soldiers react, you can change the color of your cardboard box, and you can even put a poster of a hot female or marine onto it, it will trigger enemy soldiers, there you can come behind them, kill them, strangle them, whatever you want. When you get an enemy, you can kill him, stunt him, or ask him for additional info, like where other enemies are, etc. You have multiple buddies, each customizable in many ways. A lot of outfits, for each of them, customizing chopper, it's weapons, customizing Quiet (a buddy you meet in one of the missions), her costumes and weapons, there is a cute dog, which colors and suits could be also changed. And much more. You can do some side ops, meeting with soldiers that can let you customize your weapons colors/skins, all of these features make the game awesome. The way rain falls on character suit making it wet and graphics that makes all this look beautiful is amazing. Gameplay as said earlier is perfect. Movement options, you can walk really slow, take cover, everything is done with a lot of details, it's amazing. The thing I enjoyed the most on the other hand, is music. Oh God, so many beautiful melodies, brings this game to the TOP. Just staying in the desert, listening to games original theme from your iDroid gives me chills.  CONS: Oh boy. This part literally destroys the majority of sweet things game offers. I'll start with the story, as it's the most important thing of this game of course. I never played previous MGS, and this is my first one. My 'start'. And I liked it... Most of the time. But way the main protagonist just keeps mouth shout is irritating. Somebody asks him a question, he replies with just YES or NO, it's not like it isn't enough, but I'd expect a little bit more, I'd expect something deeper, to better connect me with character. As I said, it's my start, so when I saw [spoileri]Ellie flying away with those kids and that machine[/spoileri] I felt like I'm on the half of the game... But it was the end. The mission that should have occurred later was removed due to it being incomplete. I was kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but what I played until that, was just AMAZING. Game has a lot of unlogical things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, sometimes you'd be noticed trough walls, but at the end of the day, it's single-player, nobody cares mate, you'd just go on, you can install save games at any time, you can reply at enemy time, nobody cares... So, there were not any more CONS in single player except, Incomplete Story, Silent Protagonist, Unlogical 'things'.  METAL GEAR ONLINE 3: Kill me, please: PROS: So it's finally here, and things I'm going to complain about here, are the ones that will not be changed after BETA release, as it's like this on consoles for few months already, and it isn't fixed. But let's get to the few good things that are in here. First, you are in able to customize female characters, creator is decent, it lacks some features, like more hair maybe, but again, they are soldiers, and it's not so useful for them (and then again, quiet had ponytail, she was also soldier God damn it), Online has a new place, that isn't available in Single Player, and that's awesome. Graphics and gameplay are same as it is in Single Player and nothing new here. Those are pretty much only good features of MGO3, everything else is similar to other shooters. CONS: Oh boy, where do I start? First, the game has 5 maps, which are really huge, for 3 really small and boring game mode, of which one is so broken, nobody plays it. There is a RUSH feature, which makes these maps smaller, but then, they are so small. Good thing there is weather feature, you can set time, and it can really change the look of the map, they look insanely different at day and at night, which is cool I guess. A thing that literally strangles me is the suicide feature, the way character will die from same height on one edge of the map, and will survive from the other, makes me cringe. Another disgusting thing is that weapons randomly get nerfed, and it takes so long to get new weapons. The Same weapon deals less damage as you progress for some reason. It's one of those multiplayer games that has 9 thousand levels, each unlocking something useless, but every thousand levels you will get a gun or something that can hurt enemies. Then, you can have only 3 characters, but you can't customize them after you create them. It's one of the stupiddest things ever. And one character you must have is the one you create at the beginning of the game, you can not change his gender or anything like that, and back when I made him, I asked on forums, 'how do I make a female character', quoting a player from discussions who's name I can not remember ''If I'm going to look at ♥♥♥ for the majority of game time, it better be female at least.'', the guy had a point. Back to the topic, I said how nobody cares about unlogical stuff in single player, but multiplayer has logical issues, its just disgusting mate. Machine gun can deal more damage from distance then sniper can, what. And it's not the worst thing, cloak class has a lot of advantages, as at specific parts of the level they are completely invisible, it can cost you a whole match sometimes. Also, game does not have any anti-cheat feature and seems like it won't in the full release, making it a Heaven for cheaters. There is a lot more I can rant about here, but I just can't. CONS UPDATE 1: Every second spent in this ''game'' just reveals how bad it actually is. You will come across players who spam Rocket Launchers, 'cause they can. Seems like some developers never heard of balance. Also, grenades explode right after being thrown. Sweet. CONS UPDATE 2: As sh*ttiest online game I have ever played, RPG spam is a piece of cake, when you come across players who spam Grenade Launchers, as they have better rate of fire. But maybe I have misunderstood this game. It's an indie studio, game made by 10 people, other 20.000 have some type of brain disease as it seems.   Other issues with online are something that will hopefully be fixed in full release, such as better team balance, team and all chat, some minor issues with latency, and more costumes and stuff. For a sect of Kojima prayers around that go trough these reviews voting them off just because they don't recommend the game, please understand this: Game is awesome. Kojima did a great job with the story. But the studio left it unfinished. Kojima made singleplayer awesome, Online was left for Konami and Kojima Productions, and it's really bad. By how it is, it will not survive for too long. Stop praising everything without a little bit of criticism.', and again, for an incomplete story, paying 60 dollars is too much. It isn't any better if you get a broken multiplayer in that price. You read what I wrote, you decide. Good luck.",
