            "review_text": "A fantastic port that does almost everything right.  It's the same FFX you know and love, but with a fresh coat of paint. Assuming you liked it on the PS2, you'll be able to fall in love all over again with the PC version.  Let me start with the cons, as they are few but still annoying.  - Still no ability to skip cut scenes. - The minigames are still terrible. - Inputting Auron's overdrive prompts on a non-PS2 controller has been clumbsy. - It's the same game, so if you hated it back in the day, you'll still hate it now. - Seriously, why can't we skip cutscenes?  Really, that's it. Now for the overwhelming pros.  - Runs smoothly, without issue. Immediately recognized my controller, had no crashes or freezes or even any bugs. - Runs QUICKLY. The PS3 Remastered version had load times, not long ones, but still noticeable, especially when entering several different rooms at once; you'd see the spinning Jecht symbol and have to wait five seconds. This version has none of that. Much faster. - Remastered textures. The games looks better than ever (though little if any different from the PS3/4 remastered versions). - Additional content (compared to US PS2 version). You can now fight the Dark Aeons and Penace, as well as use minor new abilities and equipment, not to mention the Expert Sphere Grid. - PC Perks. At the press of a button, you can have no random encounters or one every two steps; you can speed the gameplay up x2 or x4; you can even enter a 'cheat mode' where you have max stats. This speeds things up so much. Farming for the monster area? Turn on turbo and more encounters and you'll be done in less than half the time. Fantastic. - The Creature Creator in FFX2 deserves a special shoutout. Yes, FFX2 is an abomination, yada yada, I know ... but Creator Creature is fun! You can access it after the introduction and just go to town. It almost makes the rest of the game less disasterific. - Can choose between original or the enhanced soundtrack, and the original or expert sphere grids. - Still the same game, so if you loved it back in the day, you'll feel the same today.  This is the forth time I've bought a version of FFX, and this is the best version, hands-down. How often can you say that about a port of a console game?",

And it destroys me all over again every time I watch the ending or listen to 'To Zanarkand'.    It will always be number one for me. Seriously, I love this game so much I can't even handle it anymore, so I had to make a review. It has absolutely everything: good characters (I can't believe how many people hate Tidus, but it's probably because they never finished the game so I kinda get it. His character development is amazing and I am not ashamed to say he is my favourite video game character ever, I can't even begin to explain how much I love him; and don't even get me started on Yuna), awesome story, AMAZING soundtrack, good battle system, and the graphics are also nice. Every FF, or even RPG fan should give it a try. The port is also very good, haven't had any problems with it. I'm so happy it got released on Steam. Actually, I'm happy this game exists. It's more than just a game to me - it's a part of me. I wish I could erase my memories of it and then play it all over again. I like a lot of games, but this one I absolutely adore. It has a special place in my heart. Give this game a chance. It's definitely worth it.",

I have an FX-8350 and a GTX960, and it runs smooth without any stuttering of crashing. That said, there are some weird audio issues, but this may just be a driver issue.

I loved it back then because of all of its charm, starting with the beautiful and memorable music, nice characters and good plot. I have spent so many, many hours on this game on my PS2 and I never imagined that it would be available some day on PC. I am very glad that this day came and now I am able to repeat the experience on my computer. I can recommend this game with all of my heart. I am aware that huge part of my praise is caused because of the nostalgia, but you have to believe me that Final Fantasy X is worth playing. In my opinion the battle system in FFX is one of the best that was used in FF franchise, and the sphere grid system is also very well thought as it allows you to mix abilities as you like. When it comes to the port, I was afraid that it would be ruined, but luckily I was wrong. The game works very well and I have not experienced any problems thus far.  What is more the HD remaster looks very nice and I can't say anything bad about it. When it comes to me, this game is far better than most of the new FF's, so I will repeat myself to tell you again that I truly recommend it.  As for the FFX-2, I honestly cannot say that it is a bad game. It may not be as brilliant as FFX, but it is not a total mistake either. Do I have to add that it also has a very beautiful soundtrack?  To sum up, I say: go for this game! Discover the beauty within it, experience the beautiful music and help Yuna and others in their quest. ",

At the time of its initial release, the quality of graphics and gameplay was at the top of all others, possibly the best on the PS2. After all those years, this game still holds up in terms of gameplay. The game features a turn based system, that incorporates more strategic actions requiring the player to understand that each character is built around the idea that they are a specific counter to certain enemies. Taking that into consideration the system creates a situation in which every battle will require a different party composition per enemy groups encountered.  In terms of story, we begin with our protagonist thrown into a group that is just about to embark on a journey to save the world from a seemingly natural calamity. (possible spoilers ahead) Originating from a very modern world, the player is able to empathize with the protagonist as he inquires about this new world with antiquated technologies and traditions. However, as he learns more about the world, he finds that this world seems to hold things that belonged to the world he came from. A city known as Zanakand is also in this world, the Blitzball victory pose has turn into a prayer pose for the dominant religion, and most notably a man named Jecht, the father of the protagonist who turned missing for a decade, is now a well known hero whom perished in battle, also a decade prior.",

I was sad when it first was re-released as it was on a system I didn't own. Seeing it on Steam made me squee with delight and purchase it instantly which is a rarity for me.  If you haven't played this game before I still reccomend every moment of it.  Final Fantasy X is one of my favorite Final Fantasy stories as well. You might hear people gripe about X-2.... if you accept the fact it's pretty much a girl-power fan service extra bit of gaming after loving X then you will enjoy it. I see a few people saying **** X-2.... it's not nearly as well rounded and it won't draw you in like X.... but I can't say I don't enjoy that game either. I actually really liked that game. It was fun &lt;.&lt; I'm not sure why it gets so much hate... it's just not really connected to X in a deep way.   My advice for you if you're reading reviews to decide is... yes it's totally worth it just for X... and X-2 is a light-hearted and actually super fun game, if you aren't up your own Final Fantasy fankid bum and can just accept and enjoy it for what it is.

            "review_text": "This is one of my favorite games ever and I'm sooooooooooo glad it finally came to the PC, I almost never thought it would happen, and it's even better than I ever thought it could be on PC.  Originally I already bought this on PS3 and it was already great-looking with amazing nostalgic value there but this version takes everything I liked about the PS3 HD Remaster and makes it even better, like including both the original music and the fancy new arrangement music to switch between. They originally wanted to do this on the PS3 version as well but didn't bother due to size restraints.  This game is very stable and well optimized for any modern 1st-day PC release, let alone a PC port from Square Enix. They really put some work in with this one. There's a real menu when you hit escape instead of just opening a jarring 'Close Window?' prompt in a Windows UI box appearing over the game as with many other FF games. The aformentioned pause menu has an ACTUAL IN-GAME GRAPHICS SETTINGS MENU!!!!!! It's got MSAA options, SMAA options, texture options, shadow options and a few others. I personally have the settings maxed out and it looks great. I play it on 1440p and the textures are incredible considering it's a 15 year old game originally made for Standard Definition screens now being played on an extremely large but relatively uncommon resolution above the typical 1080p that the HD Remaster was probably optimized for already on PS3/4. Presumably this means 4K will look great as well for those with such monitors. So far no crashing at all and only some minor choppiness in areas that have a lot going on such as in Al Bhed Home, which is perfectly normal and expected.  The XBox One controller actually works perfectly as well. Final Fantasy VIII didn't work with controllers at all, Final Fantasy IX had controller support but it was so dysfunctional I couldn't even play the game. This game has perfect controller support and using it feels natural: everything just works, and there's no weirdly mapped buttons. The game also uses actual XBox controller buttons in the UI for explanations instead of defaulting to keyboard keys.  My only issues are really small ones, mostly that some minor things about the gameplay weren't addressed in the Remastering process, like the inconvenient inability to exchange spheres in cloister puzzles instead of having to find a slot to leave one sphere so you could pick up the other. It would've been nice of them to acknowledge how tedious these puzzles are and improve it just a little bit sort of like they did with the booster options, but it would've required new animations I think. Also the Blitzball automatic movement AI is awful, passing to your ideal shooter on the left side doesn't mean they will try to get between defenders and get closer to the goal for an angled shot and only having to deal with a defender or two, or possibly even having an open shot. Instead, they still instantly move backwards diagonally towards the middle and seem to try gathering up as many opposing team players as possible so you're having to shoot/pass/breakthrough in quadruple coverage from center field. Honestly I didn't expect them to fix these things anyway though, it just would've made the game that much closer to perfection.  Any PC gamer who liked Final Fantasy X back in the day on PS2, I would strongly recommend this game to them. It's really not the same lazy quality port as all the other Final Fantasy ports, they did a very good job on this game and I consider it to be the definitive FFX experience.",

At the start screen i set graphics quality to low.  Important to note this little fix is intended to be used until a bug fix patch is out   The game hasn't crashed and while the games scenery has suffered a little. the Low fps hasn't been a issue and the graphic quality has greatly improved with the characters and no more lagging in speech and mouth movements.  -Review-  I find that the graphic quality isn't a overall issue when set to low. I find that anything Medium + only affects the scenery, making the stone bridge near Luca look more fractured. Other items just appear lightly texured over the low settings. The Characters on the other hand start to look like PS2 graphics quality and performance is just plain laggy when you have the graphics setting over Low.

It is an incredible story I have not seen beaten in any other game period, yes some of the fighting can get repetetative now and then, but it is so worth it... I am a grown man... and I have to admit I cryed for the first time in 10 years for that ending, only game that come close story wise would be Planescape Torment though a much different kind of story, I have to say we might have to wait another 5 to 10 years to get any story as good as the one in FFX, I have to go through the game again and see if it is possible to archieve everything I missed, every single character is very loveable as well, they are all my favourites of all time.

In other words, yes it's capped, no it's not a big deal, and no it isn't an easy fix for the developer.  Overall very pleased we got a release of this game at all, let alone the excellent performing version we seem to have, and am looking forward to the long hours I'm going to put into this game again.",

Graphically, it looks amazing, even at 1366x768. As added bonuses, exclusive to this version, are 'Boosters'. These toggles allow for 2x/4x speed (great for traveling far quickly without a chocobo), 'Supercharge' is good as well, which charges your character's overdrive meters each turn and heals them periodically. 'More Encounters/No Encounters' is self-explanatory enough, you are able to control the game's random encounter rate to help with grinding or avoiding needless battles. An 'Auto-Battle' feature has also been added to have an AI control your characters in battle. Though this usually limits them to basic attacks, no magic or items. 'Hide HUD' does was it says as well. Next, is the 'cheats' that work similar to a trainer program. Enabling these can Max out your character's skills, Gil, and give you 99 of all items in the game, excluding Key/Mission Items. The game is locked at 30 FPS which apparently bothers people. Doesn't bother me since this is exactly how it was on the PS2/3/4/Vita, so I have no reason to expect more. FFX-2 is relatively stable as well, other than a strange bug that happens when attempting to pause using the keyboard, the game crashes entirely. Pausing with a controller works fine. Just don't play X-2 with keyboard controls and you'll be fine.",

            "review_text": "Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster on PC is probably the definitive version of both games for you to play. Final Fantasy X for me is one of the best JRPG's of all time for various reasons: the world of Spira is rich and diverse; it has a great story, even if sometimes some things don't make much sense; the cast is rich; the combat system is old school, but that's the reason why i like it: turn based combat; to win battles you'll need different strategies even for normal encounters; leveling up through a grid allows for more customization; the soundtrack is simply amazing. Although there are a few things that i don't really like: idle party members don't gain AP; the minigames are crap (except for blitzball); the areas are mostly corridors, and there's no airship; you still can't skip cutscenes (why?). But still, it's a great game that alone deserves you to buy this collection. And you get all the international version content (extra superbosses and a X-2 prologue). It's worth it. And then there's Final Fantasy X-2. As a whole, i actually like this game, but i understand most of the criticism this game has: it's a fanservice cashgrab; the map is mostly recycled from X; it has almost no story, and what's here isn't much interesting; it's mostly a side-quest galore (but better that the ones in X, although blitzball here kinda sucked for me); the cast is less interesting; the soundtrack sucks (with some exceptions). It seems that the best thing this game has is the combat, going back to the ATB system and adding a class change mechanic mid-combat. It has a lot of options, but for me it's almost pointless, since most of the strategy from X was removed. With a few exceptions, you can beat most of the game by just using the normal attack and healing with Hi-Potions without too much trouble. But despite all this, it's still an enjoyable game, only not as good as X. And this international version adds a lot of content. First, there's the creature capture where you can capture and use monsters in combat, even if you don't have control over them. Leveling them up unlocks a mini story with a cutscene. Many monsters have cutscenes to unlock, and if you watch them all there's around 4-6 hours of extra movies. They are silly, but made me laugh. Secondly, there's the Final Mission, a rogue-like dungeon turn-based game that serves as an epilogue to X-2. And i was surprised by it. It's not a minigame, but almost an entire game that will take you around 10-20 hours to beat. It has an incredible amount of depht for what it is. It stars easy, but becomes hard if you don't have a solid strategy. Fortunately, there's plenty of good options, and i enjoyed playing it. This remaster also adds an audio drama epilogue, and it's bad. It's 30 minutes of screwing with the story of X. Just terrible. This PC version also includes some in-game cheats like superspeed and auto-battle (great for grinding) and an auto-save that saves you a lot of trouble, trust me. It makes the games a little easier, but they are optional. It has a 30 FPS cap, but it works just fine. It will run on almost all PC's, and i never experienced slowdown or a crash. The download size is big though. In the end, this is a great package that includes 2 entire games (one great and one good) and a lot of extras including an extra game. On your PC. And the price is also fair for what you get.",

Before, I was not keen on playing the HD remaster when it was first released for the PS3 because for me it was the just the same game with enhanced graphics. But I bought the PC version since it would be a nice addition to my Steam game library. And it was a nostalgic feeling to play again this wonderful Final Fantasy classic on PC. Great graphics settings, smooth gameplay (no lags) even it's locked on 30 fps, love the game boosts (it helps somehow when you don't have quite the time to power up your characters, and the no encounters is very helpful in some occassions. But even with the game boosts, there's still quite the challenge of getting the ultimate weapons). Although it's quite a disappointment that I will not be able to play the game in Japanese audio with English subtitles without modding. Anyway, this is a great PC port overall and very satisfied with it.",

The only thing I don't like so far is that they pretty much made cheating extremely easy there is a option that gives all items and another that max's gil (money) and finally one that unlocks all skills and you can use this by simply hitting esc and pressing one button in game.

            "review_text": "I can't believe this port is finally here! I've had my steam user image set as Tidus and Yuna sixty-nineing each other since I installed steam way back when. This just shows my love for the game.  This game has changed my life. If you have never played it, I highly suggest setting some time aside to enjoy a true masterpiece (This game originally came out on the PS2 where I spent a thorough amount of time completing the game so don't hate for the limited time with this port. Like I said, this is a review on the port only.)  This review is only going to consist of the quality of the port (only tested FFX because FFX-2 is like a toy in a happy meal. It provides some low grade entertainment for about 30 seconds and gets dull real quick. Then you look back at your time with the toy and think, 'why the hell did they even think this was a good idea' and 'I want my 30 seconds of life back so I can play more FFX').  Pro's: 1. The first thing I like about a port is when it ACTUALLY WORK ON LAUNCH. So far so good! (Very limited testing so far, however... just keep that in mind.) 2. I don't know what people are talking about in these reviews, but yes, you CAN choose which version of music you prefer. Whether that be the OST or the arranged HD remake version. So if you want hardcore nostalgia, go original. 3. The game supports resolutions up to 3840x2160 with multiple options for graphical settings, a nice touch. Running this port at ultra looks great, at least for a game that was designed more than a decade ago. 4. Xbox 360 controller support. Always a plus. 5. Achievements! Huzzah! 6. After spending some time with the game, I realize that the function keys are actually a great addition. The port has some function keybindings that allow manipulation of the game. For example, the F1 key allows a turbo mode which puts the game in a x2 setting, pressing F1 again allows x4, and then back to the original. This is super helpful if you want to skip through something you've already seen a dozen times like an aeon summon cinematic (they also give you an option for allowing 'quick summons' which cuts the cinematic time down)  The F2 key allows your team of FFX heroes to allows be supercharged for use of their special abilities. Already an easy cheat with a touch of a button. Probably going to avoid this one for now.  F3 alters random enemy encounters. I think this is great, I already have used this with no regrets. Sometimes you just want to run around and explore without getting a spontaneous heart attack from the random battle sequences screen crash.  F4 automates battles so you can watch. Tedious fights are of the past.  Also, in the game options, you can open up a menu which allows you to change the game's parameters. If you want infinite money, BOOM, it's yours. I feel these added functions will stay as a con. I personally like to earn achievements genuinely, makes me feel like I worked to get that mark. That's just me. I will expand on the pro's when I have more time put into the game. For now, I think this will suffice. Here's the bad.  Con's: 1. Yeah, I'm sure you have seen it so far. 30 fps lock.  I get it, there has to be a reason. Bringing a game from the early 2000's into 2016 with new resolutions, rendering, operating systems, etc., is not a small feat. However, I am very biased because my monitor has G-SYNC support. I use an Acer XB280HK, and the game looks like it runs at ~50 fps. Read up on G-SYNC. It's a great tool for this kind of fps cap. 2. The price. 24 dollars is not bad, but come on. Lets be honest, we are all only buying this port to play FFX. FFX-2 doesn't exist. I am convinced it doesn't. I am not going to even start with that. I'm assuming that's why they packaged them together so they could be like 'Hey, instead of charging 15 bucks for FFX standalone, let's throw FFX-2 and make it a dual purchase so the kiddies think they are getting a good deal for double the price!' I see through your marketing strategy Square Enix... and I approve, it was smart ;) 3. That's it for cons so far. Once I have a play-through completed, I will be sure to update any bugs or crashes.",

I'll try to make this short.  Visuals 8/10: The new HD is nice, I always thought the characters looked a little funky in Cinematics but the visuals have aged quite well, considering.  Audio 8/10: I remember every song in Final Fantasy 7, and 8. This one... not completely memorable, but there are a few songs that hold quite a lot of emotion, and meaning in them. Uematsu does good work. The talking sometimes got on my nerves because of their mouths moving when their voices were stopped [Nitpicking perhaps, pet peeve of mine] but considering it's the first voice-acted of the series, it's a pretty damn good start.  Gameplay 7/10: I love the ability to switch to any teammate during combat, and the overdrives are pretty neat. That being said there were a lot of annoying mini-games [The temples] and one that is complete hit or miss for most [Blitzball].  Characters 7/10: I don't feel an intense amount of 'rite of passage' for many of the characters, there was no gradual change only immediate ones, which in a game of this length I feel as if some characters at least should have a slow change, especially in a 'fish out of water' scenario.  Story 9/10: I didn't feel as strong about the events in this as some of my favorite Final Fantasies, but I still teared up at the end. Even though it's not my favorite Final Fantasy, this is still a period when Squaresoft really knew how to wrap up games and leave you watching credits hoping for more. There were characters I was sad to see go through a few things [Sorry, no spoilers] but there was still some closure for those characters.  Overall 8/10 : Holds up well for as long as it's been out. Pretty different from the few Final Fantasies before it [the world at least]. As much as it wasn't my favorite, as I said I was still sad to see the journey end, and debateably as abruptly as it did. Definitely worth a look for any JRPG fan.  That being said, I haven't played X-2 and in truth I don't know if I will, but if I do I will review it. I dislike how they're bundled and force you to buy both, but for 20 bucks, 2 games isn't bad.",

My experience with this port so far has been amazing but I'm able to crank it up to 4k and play it on high. It looks great and plays smooth. I'm running a i5-4760k and SLI GTX 970 FTWs on Windows 10. I only overclock my CPU and RAM. I've heard some complaints about multiple GPU performance but have not experienced any issues myself. I'm running the most recent GeForce drivers. I would recommend turning down your GPU to stock and make sure you have the latest drivers if you have any issues. Some games don't do well overclocked because the GPU has to wait for other processes to be complete before turning the next frame. That means, if you crank up your GPU...it just ends up waiting longer which can cause issues. Some chipsets don't work well together either. It's worth knowing you have a chipset specifically for your GPU.  I'm a fan of orchestrated music and this port allows you to use the arranged score in play of the original soundtrack. They knocked it out of the park with this function. The arranged score is beautiful and fits in perfect.  The gameplay is stable (on a stable system) and I've had no tearing, freezing, skipping, nor found any bugs to complain about up to Luca (haven't been xping much if at all). I'll update once I'm through the story.  While the graphics settings only offer low, medium, and high...you can tweak settings through the Nvidia control panel if you are running on a lower resolution but want to smooth textures through antialiasing. Good detail in shadows and lighting without messing with anything. Increased environment detail. Huge improvements on the original and leagues above the console HD versions if you have a powerful enough PC.  You can play on both the original and expert sphere grids. Expert can be fun just to mix things up a bit if you've ran through the game at least once already.  I don't use the game boosters but you can speed up gameplay, turn off random encounters (might use that one later), get unlimited money, unlock all skills, and always full overdrive meter.  Great port for a great game. Hope this helps.     ",

If you like turn based rpgs, you will like this game. This game also comes with Final Fantasy X-2 so the value you get for buying the game for $30 is good. The amount of time you can put into either game more than justifies the price. The battle system in Final Fantasy 10 is one of my personal favorite turn based battle systems. One problem I often run into during turn based battle systems is that it does not really matter what people you choose to use in battle. This is not a problem in Final Fantasy X because each person has a distinct role in the game so what people you bring into battle has a big effect on the chance you have at winning that fight. The level up system in Final Fantasy X is also intresting. When you win battles you get points and once you get a certain amount of points you get a step. Once you have a step you can use it to move around a grid full of spheres that you can put orbs in (almost all monsters in the game drop orbs) that will raise your stats or give you new skills. So the more steps you get the more orbs you can activate. It is an intresting system that allows you to control character growth. When starting the game you have the option to use the standard or expert sphere grid and the diffrence between the two is that the standard grid puts you a set path durning the start of the game which gives that charecter its role. The expert grid allows you to put any charecter down any role giving you the most freedom. However, it is harder to max out your stats on the expert grid so if you want to play post game you might want to pick the standard grid. But overall this game is really good and I would recommend it to people who love turn based battle systems. If you are new to turn based battle systems this game is a good place to start but I would highly recommend going down the standard grid.",

After all these years, still amazed at the end.  Part 2 - FFX-2 It's a change. Though I do like this refreshing change. Same with Part 1, played it all the versions there are.  - Good Graphics, great cutscene graphics. - Really love the soundtracks.  - Good story, I really like the plot twists but it fell a bit short at the end with the option of multiple endings.  Part 2.5 - FFX-2 Last mission - Did not really like this minigame version. Expects more then just a board-game like gamestyle   After all these hours, a few tears I feel there is still room for a part 3, FFX-3.  In every version, (spoiler) Tidus returns at the end somehow, but what happened to him? How is Spira doing? Why did Yuna change so much and FFX-Will opens up a whole new story where Tidus is back.

The soundtracks are great and memorable.  For this PC port, SE actually did a good job for this, unlike their previous ports. It's based on the PS4 version, with even more features. It has graphic settings in the game (instead of just in the game launcher).  If you're a Final Fantasy fan and a JRPG fan, don't miss this one.  10/10 for the game.  9/10 for the port.  Masterpiece.

It also goes away if I get into a battle. And comes back when the battle ends. The other issue I have is teh controller support.

I enjoyed this game so much from its simplicity yet elegant turn base gameplay design, sphere grid, story line, aeon, music, graphic, cutscenes and more.   However, for a remaster I expect something more. The very chance that they can add more into this game and make it reach even higher from what it was....they didn't take it.   If you simply play for storyline and nostalgia, it's fine to buy, it's not a bad buy especially if you play this for the first time. I reccommend you to buy this.  But for people who has played over and over before, meh.   If you actually press escape menu, and check out the 'change parameter' and 'change settings' you will understand why I'm very disappointed.  SE has this mentality of dumbing down rpg over and over visbibly in 12 and 13. The gabits in 12 and the braindead fights in 13.  Why put cheats in 10 when the game is actually very easy even for a middleschool kids like me back then. Most things die in one hit using the right person in the right target. You can choose to challenge yourself not to use sphere grids as well and that is fine. However, adding max gills, unlock all skills for all characters and max items clearly show that SE thinks their game will sell more to dumb people. Apparently people play game to stroke their epeen with cheats and easy way out this way.   Then they implment these super charge, auto battle, super charge boosters to kill the game even more. So I have to ask you whoever want to use these things? Why bother playing if you are going to let the game to everything for you to begin with?  Auto battle...kill me now. This reminds me of gambits which literally put me to sleep in 12.   Fine, you just want the story. that is fair and then you can adust enemy encountering to zero and get to the boss with those boost.   But since it is THE REMASTER, if there is anyone with brains and know how to work, they would know that most people who by this game will be the one who has PLAYED this before many times.   Why not adding in more challanges? Since there is a booster, they can add  1) Double all enemy stats 2) tripple all enemy stats 3) Disabled spheregrids 4) Removal more stats from sphere grids and unable each different characters to have some ability grids of other characers. This way your stats grow much slower AND only allow certain overlapping abilities but allow for some shared skills which increase unique roles for each character. This was a problem in end game ffx where everyone barely has differences anymore when all grids are filled.  5) More bosses and abilities.  6) More different monsters.  etc  Don't get me wrong, I love sphere grids lvling system, it's cool and refreshing. It's full of potention and creativity that allow players to customize their plays in new ways. It just needs more refinement and they had great opportunity to do this....but nope.  5) While at it, they can add more unique ability grids in there or designed hidded grids for different characters.  6) Aeon systems. Samething, eventually they will all be able to do the samething. Only their special abilities make them a tad bit more different. They should have revamp aeon upgrades and perhaps have grids of their own. Modify their overdrive to have their own bonus attributes or something but nope.   This review is a criticisms particulary for how the SE dev made this game.   I will not make any compliment of how the modders can change this becaus ethey are not the one who get paid for this.  If I would make a criticism of this game base on mods, I might as well make a review for those modders and that have nothing to do with SE anymore.   So yes, this game can be great and even better with mods and implement more challenges.....but well gonna have to wait for mods and it will be a seperate reviews.   playing this game and how i had experience with 12 and 13, apparently SE still has no idea why their game is getting worse and worse. What makes them think creating a braindead game where computer think everything for you is fun for gamers I will never understand.  I hope 15 is not another simulator where AI plays for you.    As for ffx-2, they can definitely make it harder and make monsters have more unique stats like flan take no physical dmg like in X. But no, it's as braindead button spams with no strategy like always.   Modders pls, take this game to glory, I beg you.",

The game has a beautiful story, which is why I bought this version, so I could experience that story again fourteen years later on my PC. However, the quality of the product is what prompted a Steam refund after an hour.   I can't believe this is classed as HD. The picture quality is, for lack of a better term, jagged. It looks like an old PS1 game. Hair is angular, cloth is angular, pixelated rough edges abound. Some character faces seem airbrushed or changed for no reason.  You can't truly rebind the keys on keyboard, as A is required to do some odd boss fight move within the first hour. Using WASD isn't feasible because of this, and there are other keys that we're informed can't be changed. This isn't great.  If this is HD then I'm a carrot. It's so atrociously poor quality that I have dusted off my PS2 and am replaying the game on that.  However, a lot of people won't have that option. I understand that. But know what you're getting into. This game looks like it belongs on the PS1, it actually feels like a downgrade from the PS2 version. If you haven't played this before, £16 for both games is a bargain. If you can get around terrible controls, go for it and revel in the story. But for Square to proclaim this as HD and a 'remastered' version feels like an insult. They could have made this shine like a gem instead of the amateurish offering they give here.  Too long, didn't read? The game of Final Fantasy X is fantastic. Square's sloppy effort to port it to PC isn't. What I saw in my hour of playing was, in gaming terms, disheartening. Buy if you've never experienced it, but don't expect great graphics or controls.  ",

For one the combat system is very fun, felt like a lot of the other FF games I've played in the past as well as Bravely Default, a spiritual successor to the FF games on the 3DS. Unlike other FF games I've played however, you can switch characters in and out at will during battle without taking up turns. The leveling system using the sphere grid was an interesting twist on leveling your characters. I personally prefer the usual type of leveling systems in my games, but the way the sphere grid works, it fits in just fine. In terms of difficulty, this game isn't too hard. A couple bosses might leave you stuck, but that's about it. I didn't find it requiring too much grinding either, so that was pretty nice as well.  The story of FFX was pretty good. Although it didn't really hook me as much as some other players, it was still an enjoyable story overall. I personally really liked the backstory and history of this game, especially of that of Zanarkand, that of the main characters, and of Sin. The music for this game is alright, not amazing, but not too bad either. A couple of the tracks from this game I actually quite enjoyed including one of the final boss fights of whom I won't mention.   In the end, FFX was quite the enjoyable experience for me, and if you're a fan of turn-based RPGs, new or old, then I'd definitely suggest checking this game out.",

The soundtrack is one of the best out there (the remastered tracks can be hit or miss, but they're mostly good), and the art direction is great (minus a few details in this remaster which were better in the original IMO). Still one of the best RPGs out there, with tons of content to explore and sink hours into. It's a narrative-driven RPG so don't expect too much freedom during the course of the main story (though as usual with Final Fantasies, you'll be able to do as you please in the late game). For this remaster and port in particular, I haven't encountered any issues whatsoever during my 70ish hours of play. Works fine on my end just like it did in the old PS2 back in the day.  Personal Highlights: -Engaging, strategic turn based battle system (it's a bit on the easy side, but still very fun). -Character growth system that was interesting and innovative for its time. If you're a stat-maxer be ready for quite a few hours of grinding. -Good characters and good stories complement each other, this one does it beautifully. To me, the best example of those two done right in the series.  -Music not being done solely by Uematsu can make old fans worry, but then you get to experience it and see the other two composers put their heart into it and it turns into a very cohesive and complementary whole thing. Hamauzu's ambient tracks are amazing, for example.  Cons: -Minigames are more like 'challenges' with Blitzball being the only minigame fully fleshed out. And Blitzball itself is hit or miss. Some people really love it though. The caveat to this is that all of said minigames are entirely optional (except the single mandatory blitzball game that you don't even need to win). -A lot of the post game can be quite time consuming (final weapons' upgrading, capturing monsters, etc.)",

The game's minimum requirements suggest that this is a well optimised port capable of running on the now-antiquated (and midrange for the time) 9600GT, among others. There are a number of graphical settings which I assume run the gamut between the Vita and recent PS4 release, and any surplus of graphical horsepower can be put towards higher resolutions/downsampling and anti-aliasing; I'm running at 4k (1080p display) with 8xMSAA and SMAA, which cleans up any aliasing without distorting the details (although I don't recommend running SMAA or FXAA on less than a 4k resolution unless you have no other option). Props to them for decoupling MSAA and post-process methods, too. The 30 frame lock isn't a problem for this game generally although I recognise that it could cause nausea especially if sitting close to the screen.  Compared to the PS2 version, this has the same gameplay improvements as every subsequent remaster, plus the cheats which include a fast-forward mode that sadly doesn't work for cutscenes. Tidus is still a prick and the voice acting is still poor, something that gives away its position as one of the first (mostly) fully voice-acted JRPGs. The battle system is probably the best of the series. Character progression is relatively non-linear, you have the choice of branching out into other characters' skills or continuing along the obvious progression. Haven't played X-2 Remaster yet but that game was good also and will probably remain so!",

Pros: - Remastered graphics hold up really well - My old Logitech Rumblepad 2 worked immediately (no vibration afaik, but I don't care about that) - Tactical and engaging combat system which allows exchange of characters/equipment during a fight - Tons of content for a fairly decent price  Cons (all of these are really minor though): - You need a mod to actually enable the japanese voices - Sountrack feels neither as good nor as diverse as previous entries in the franchise (still serviceable though). Most pieces seem to be variations of the main theme. - Sometimes the facial animations are somewhat lacking and don't convey the emotions properly, - Sphere board is confusing in the beginning and a little laborious to use, - Story so far is... nyeeeh. Okay for a JRPG, but no masterpiece imo. - I utterly suck at Blitzball (probably not the game's fault). - QTE Overdrive attacks.

The story is immersive,you have the feeling beein the main Prot,awesome Aeons to summon+entrance animations.  The gameplay is grindy and easy to understand compared to some linear grid that only requiers 'xp''points'   The music is 10/10 ,The story q.q/10, Farming monsters can be annoying but atleast its turn based and has also an end game content,  depends how you play the game from the beginning, you either try to 100% first try or finish the main story and do the rest of the content /gettin all aeons if missed,  gettin all Al-Bheds lexikons ...get MLG at Fifa water with the most annoyin in-game music and in-game formulars beyond comprehension and goalies who dissapoint you and get all unique weapons for the followers and 24/7 Monster farm farming .   I don't recommend looking stuff up the internet on how to get the certain items or how to combine Rikus grenades because thats the most fun part abt the game , i used to write all the combinations i've already tried on a paper because i didn't had internet during the PS2 time and it didn't ruin my game experiences like nowdays where when you look up stuff the game is basicly no fun anymore.  Better handicap yourselfe than ending up spending xx€/$ to just only play a game for 30hrs and rot in your library.   Also get Kingdom Hearts 1&amp;2",

It crashes every time I try to start it. Ha-ha. Thank you Square for another dead port. Now I hate you little more.  There is no hope you'll fix this because you never do. It's just my old habit to report. Maybe I can help someone to change his/her mind to buing this port.  UPD 05/17 after deleting and installing again it became more stable, but still too laggy. Ok, it's not completely broken for me now, but it's still too bad for commercial product.  UPD 2 it appeares issue was in bad optimisation. Change thumb-down to thumb-up, but shame on developers, they've released very raw product.",

            "review_text": "Final Fantasy X might be my favorite in the series. It's got a unique setting, a great turn-based combat system that demands strategy, and a heartfelt story that once again shows you don't necessarily need happily ever after to have a satisfying conclusion. The graphics hold up well and look great in HD. The music is wonderful and you can choose between the remastered soundtrack or the original version. It's on the linear side though, which I know bothers some folks, and the lack of skippable cutscenes hurts replay value somewhat. I love the story and characters, but it'd be nice to skip over the more boring scenes after a few times through.  Final Fantasy X-2 is a whole different beast. While it has the same setting and some returning characters, it takes place a few years after the original and has a much more light-hearted tone - although there's a story worthy of Final Fantasy underneath its bubbly exterior. It's also got a great take on the series trademark job system and the best version of the classic ATB system to date. Notably, the game abandons its prequel's linearity in favor of a very non-linear structure that lets you tackle things in whatever order you want. This one's hit or miss among fans, but I personally like it.  As for as ports go, it's one of Square's better PC offerings. It runs at a steady framerate - although it's worth mentioning it's locked at 30 FPS - and looks really nice. I never experienced any bugs or crashes, and overall was impressed by the polish of it all after the disappointing FFXIII ports. Plus you're getting two great full-length RPGs for the price of one, which is tough to beat.  I recommend this to anyone looking to revisit these classics and / or wanting more quality JRPGs on their PC.",

He did it multiple times...until one day I snapped and chased him through my bedroom, our living room, to our front yard...where my neighbors at the time witnessed pure hatred between two brothers aged 8 and 10 years old. As he ran from me I caught up and punched him square in the back of his spine. He dropped like a rock and I choked him until he passed out.   12 years later...he surprised me with the remastered version on PS3 and recently got me as Steam giftcard to get the Steam version.  X/X. Best brother ever. Would choke out again.  Greatest bonding moment ever.",
