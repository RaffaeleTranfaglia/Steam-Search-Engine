Once I got to the camera sections I see now why it asked. You gotta be quick and move fast if you want to line up those perfect shots at the right angles.",

            "review_text": "I went in not really expecting much at a glance and with absolutly no knowledge of sonico's character. My only impressions were: 'that it 'looked fun' from a lets play video I watched.'  I must say that I was not expecting the quality of this game to be as good as it is.  The artwork and visuals in Sonicomi are fantastic; backed up by an absolutly beautiful soundtrack that matches the mood and the emotion of the characters on screen perfectly. Then there are the characters themselves who are very fun and full of life.  As someone who enoys FPS games and has played a lot of visual novel titles, I highly recomend Sonicomi to those who enjoy these two things. You will not be disapointed.",

            "review_text": "Originally started off with the 8th ending, not expected it much, then I went working on the endings for the main horizontal axis of the endings board, some really funny, others extremely cringy and quite a few very heartworming. But when I reached the true ending, I geniunely cried, the story is so touching that I think I could easily play it again... especially considering that I think that there are a couple secret endings I want to get to...  So I recommend you get the game for the photshoots that are extremely fun, even on hard(which I did for every run as soon as I unlocked it), for the enveloping story and the good and bad moments. Nitroplus+ I take my hat off at you, you have done such an excellent job making this game that I think its the best one I've played up to date and possibly for a long time. Do not stop with this excellent work, keep making great games like this one.",

I wish for the best between me and this game and that I could embrace my feelings in real life. I enjoy long walks on the beach with Sonico and we are the best of partners. I make sure I tuck in my Senpai Sonico body pillow every day and kiss it goodnight ;3. I reccomend this game to any serious Sonico fans and I wish that all newcomers purchase this game and enjoy the emotions that surge through my wrist as I take photots of Sonico on the set. This game has been an absolute life-changing experience and I hope on my 68th playthough I can unlock the secrets of Sonico and become a living Sonico Master.",
