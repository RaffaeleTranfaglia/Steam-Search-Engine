Every shot is a one hit kill, regardless of where you hit. Kill all the enemies to complete the level. If this sounds appealing to you, you will love the entire Delta Force series.",

Though running through out of areas places you will probably end up being lost if you are not focus on the mission hahahaha. The game is fun, would recommend buying it.  Note: I'm only talking about the story mode, if you are more of multiplayer then you are in the wrong place.",

I played the Delta Force 2, Land Warrior, Delta Force Black Hawk Down and Delta Force extreme which is the remake of the first game.   This is definitely a classic. I am huge old skool gamer fan. Delta Force defines what miltary FPS should be about. Everything that happened in DELTA FORCE was based on the real life missions of today.  I am not fussed about the graphics as I honestly think its cool. I am starting to dislike COD. There is no real challenge in COD.  DELTA FORCE is where the combat is at.  10/10 for a kick ♥♥♥ game.  works well on my laptop. 9600m GT Nvidia graphics card with windows 7 32 bit,  KICK ♥♥♥ game. A MUST HAVE GAME.",

The combat is crappy, but the large maps make up for it as you have the ability to attack at the angles you want. The mini maps look great, the attempt at realism is cute and kinda fun.   So get this if you don't feel like spending money on Operation Flashpoint.",

Time has not been kind to this title and it's hard for me to recommend it to people looking to try it now for the first time. But if it's on sale or you just have money to burn there is quite a bit of game here and it defianlty takes me back to when I played it originally if your looking for that nostalgia factor.",
