            "review_text": "DreadOut is a title that takes heavy inspiration from Tecmo's Project Zero series (Fatal Frame in the USA), where the main character, usually a young woman, explore haunted locations and fight ghosts using a camera.  Keepers of the Dark is a stand alone title that takes place during the middle of the main game, although it has little to no story in it. It features a hub-like main area from where you can access eight different locations with the purpose of hunting down a ghost in each of them (albeit each location usually has more than one). After doing so you'll be teleported back to the hub to repeat the process until you can open the final door (which will unlock at 8 ghosts defeated) and fight the last boss.  Altough a bunch of them are new, most of these areas are taken straight from the main game or even the demo, though they feature some new elements related to the new ghosts. In addition, some spirits won't appear immediately until you meet certain conditions, like collecting a number of items which may be located in different areas of the game, meaning that a bit of backtracking is required at times.  Combat is exactly the same as the main game, a very simplified version of Project Zero. No limited films, no upgrading system, no special functions or anything of that kind. It's just your phone, which includes a flashlight, and an actual camera with zooming capabilities and a flash function for a short but powerful gleam of light (which will not actually damage enemies). Basically a weapon to fight in the dark and one to fight at long range.  And like the main game, that's the general vibe of KotD: a low budget, unpolished and simplified version of Project Zero with some interesting ideas and moments. One of my favorites is in the school area, where you have to take a photo of a ghost possessing a specific statue among a large number of them. Doing so will force the spirit to run into another statue in a different part of the level, but this will also cause the previous statue to follow you around when it's out of the camera's view. You'll hear the sounds of the statue moving behind you, you'll turn around and see it in a different position, getting closer and closer to you. It's a nice and creepy idea, which actually made me smile instead of frighten me. But in a good way, if that make sense.  If you liked DreadOut, Keepers of the Dark is for you. It's light on story and even shorter, but it's more of the same setting and mechanics, and that might be enough. If you miss Project Zero, give the main game and KotD a try: just remember to keep your expectations in check.",

            "review_text": " Gameplay:  The gameplay is great, you basically have to take pictures using a cellphone or a camera to takedown ghosts but that's not just it, you actually have to explore the world around you to find items, documents, photos, and take pictures to gather all the intel toguether to solve puzzles and progress throughout the game.   Atmosphere:  I simply LOVED it, this game gave me that PS2 horror game feel, graphics are not the best but they are good enough, sound effects are on point in my opinion, some soundtracks are scary and this game can give you the Outlast feeling which you will know what it is if you have played it already, basically if you don't know where the ghosts are when you are being chased you will feel vulnerable and anxious.   Story:  I won't tell you anything about it, I personally liked it that's all I will say, but to understand it you must watch playthroughs of the first game or play it for yourself.   Length:  The game is not too big, but you might spend a good amount of time playing this game in your first playthrough because you will probably get stuck in a few parts. I took 9.9 hours to complete this game, but it depends, maybe you will be smarter or luckier than me and complete certain parts faster.   Optimization:  I think this game runs in low-end PC's, I don't consideer my PC bad but it's not a beast either, I have a i5-4440 3.1GHz, GT 640 2GB, and 12GB of RAM and I can run this at 1080p at max settings without Anti Alias.   PS:  This was previously a DLC of the original DreadOut, they just decided to make it a standalone game, that's why this isn't as big as the first one.   Conclusion:  I enjoyed this game a lot, I had a fun time playing it and the game is really cheap so why don't you just buy it and try it out for yourself?   My personal Rating:  8/10",

            "review_text": "DreadOut is the most fun I've had with a game in a long time. The creativity behind this series' scares is astounding. While many games implement the 'Slender' approach to horror (i.e. “There's the monster! Don't look at it!”), DreadOut takes its cues from the Fatal Frame series. The player is forced to confront a plethora of frightening specters with nothing more than a phone camera for a weapon. The main character, Linda Melinda (actual name), finds herself trapped in a hallway lined with doors and guarded by an unsettling caretaker. Each door leads to a different realm full of unique spirits that must be banished. This is where the game shines. Forget the usual 'objects flying across the room, loud noises, spooky jump-scares' horror tropes. DreadOut is a different animal. Some ghosts take the form of titan-sized monsters thundering out of the gloom. Others are disembodied heads slithering around a dark cistern on long hair. Others want to play games and perform for whatever unfortunate soul happens to find them. One even drags itself quickly after Linda in a maze of mannequins, stopping whenever the player turns to look at it. Jump-scares are discarded in favor of actual tension with creepy payoffs. It's GOOD, not to mention refreshing. But there are some negatives that need mentioned. Firstly, expect graphics that look like they came from the early Xbox 360 era. The team behind this game is small and based in Indonesia. They do what they can. Secondly, whoever translated this into English is in dire need of some lessons. (I assume future patches will improve the translation.) Thirdly, the game takes place near the end of Act 2 of the original DreadOut; so I strongly recommend playing that beforehand. Fourthly, the sound is a little buggy sometimes, but the effects themselves are very grotesque and eerie. Fifthly, and most disappointingly, there are very few puzzles in this game. The original DreadOut had some legitimately challenging puzzles to solve. This is mostly just a gallery of boss fights. On top of that, the levels are on the small side with limited room for exploration. The original game had lots of secret places to search, and it's sad to see that aspect missing here. Lastly, Linda is a silent protagonist and the secondary characters are on the shallow side. But there's something endearing about her. Despite never saying anything, Linda is oddly lovable. Maybe the player bonds with her through shared, traumatic experiences; or maybe having to watch her reactions to search for spirits forms a connection between character and player. For whatever reason, she's nearly iconic, and far more memorable than the usual horror protagonist. The same can be said about the game itself. DreadOut offers scares that are not easily forgotten. This is a must-have for any fan of the horror genre. The faint of heart need not apply.",

            "review_text": "It runs badly, is written terribly, is voice-acted still worse than that, has awful PS2-era textures and animations, and noticibly repetative audio looping. Worst of all, all aspects of it are explained so poorly that I had to look up most of how to play online, and even then it didn't make any sense. I don't just mean the lore (Why would a ghost be afraid of a camera phone?), but the characters and their motivations were also gibberish. The thirtieth time an old woman ghost attacks with the same animation and shrill noise, it isn't scary. It's annoying. When you resume the game from the death area, and within a second you're already attacked again while trapped in a corner, it's bad pacing. I have genuinely zero ideas how this isn't getting savaged by reviews. It's truly abysmal in every way.",
