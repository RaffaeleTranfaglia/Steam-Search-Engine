I mean honestly, I just got used to always keeping them on for Rpgs.  Basically this game is awesome and hopefully we can look forward to more fine tuning with future updates.",

            "review_text": "Glossy exterior veils empty gameplay.  So this was a slight nod to old school turn based/real time RPG/strat game, beyond that it has very little to do with the genre. Character development is limited to just a few stats and points to place, minimal gear variations, and poor ability equip.  Basically what this game amounts to is Baldar's Gate or Neverwinter Nights Lite. Super lite, there's very little actually here and while the asking prcie is not unreasonable it doesn't hold up to other titles I've purchaced at the same or lower price. Story is ok but really just a lot of reading since the voice acting was limited to the first line in some of main character interactions.  It's pretty, it's sometimes fun, but the gameplay is limiting, a bit unforgiving with mob difficulty being all over the place, with minor story telling. There are other things you could spend your money on.",

Fun gameplay that reminds me of Baldur's gate and a faster paced Divinity: Original Sin(or you don't even have to pause the action if you don't want too). A decent story with lots of lore accessed through books and npc interactions. One of the better rpg games out there and it is only $10 on sale for $8.49. I know I have paid way more for way less in the past. Great find! Give it a try, it is cheaper than eating a meal out!",

The story is interesting, characters have character, and there is a hefty chunk of funnies hidden in various books (and other such tidbits sprinkled thoughout the game). Not too dark and gloomy all the time, the locales and themes are memorable and varied enough, too! Boy, I'm having a great time with this! Will edit the review later. Who knows, if this is going to be an emotionally exciting experience as well?   While not quite as detailed as games such as Ultima 7 or Baldurs Gate, it's really, really close. The battle system is so easy to pick up, too! The controls are standard fare. Graphics is very nice, and I don't really mind that you cannot rotate the camera. In the games where you had a completely free floating camera, more often than not I found myself whizzing about, rotating like crazy, just to make sure I didn't miss anything. That's a stress factor I don't want in games like this. Divinity: Original Sin limited the camera a lot, which was a design choice I applaud :).  Furthermore, the peeps making this game are reading the steam discussions about it, and on several occasions have they already confirmed the addition of much requested features. =^_^= Awesome support!  And, I haven't encountered a single bug, yet. Just a few grammar stunts in those books. Which is fine, you know. People aren't perfect, even completely fictional authors.  Mrrow!",

The UI is confusing to newcommers, the graphics aren't anything special, the story is something you've seen before and the combat gets tedious. Ember is not the next big RPG release and thinking it is will only hurt your reception of the game when you do play it. However, what it  is  is a fun little title that delivers what it has in a charming package of silly fun. It's almost Divinity Original Sin lite in that regard. It looks to capture the spirit of the game if not the quality. And that's fine considering such a reasonable price. You'll be dissappointed if you're expecting some complex, engaging and unique title, but if all you're looking for is a solid, charming new RPG to play for cheap then this is the game for you.",

There were a good amount of side quests and a great crafting system for role play and useful stat boosts.   - Combat was realtime with pause, worked fine. Max 2 companions in party - Plenty of loot to discover or craft -Stable only crashed a few times towards endgame -Open world, some encounters can be above your current skill level.  Overall Fun game, more than worth the price.",

I believe, even though it is a slightly more in-depth RPG game, Baldurs Gate II was that last time. Since then I played the first Divinity games that had the same perspective but lacked the polish of this game.  The story is simple but compelling. There is no attempt at pathos that would conflict with the setup of the world. It is more of a light-weight RPG but simple 'flows', so that is fine for me.  The combat, exploration and loot are all excellant. I get the same joy of finding better gear as I did in Diablo II. Not many game do this right.  I have played more than the hours shown, but Steam somehow doesn't like to count correctly. Hopefully this review helps many more people to get and appreciate this game.",

            "review_text": "Ember is truly one of the best rpg released recently. The plot is quite straight forward with minor quests on the line, but keeps the story quite interesting. No loading screens!!! when you enter buildings… Is it so hard for other devs to make?   Real-time fights with pause make this game so above the D&amp;D dice games (e.g BG or Pillars of Eternity), where most of the time you just watching “miss-miss-miss-critical-dead” fight or just “critical-dead-quick reload” … or even 'fireballs and area-wide scroll spells sending off the screen and killing everything'. Of course, the game is just released and the fight balance needs some minor tweaking, as permanent stun and silence let you kill anyone quite easily. Fight combos is so good invention for such games. I know Divinity has similar, but I found Ember’s one more attractive.   Crafting is probably quite useless in the game, especially when you have a “resting option” to fully recover health and energy. Proper crafting menu, where you have a list of the crafting items with ingredients auto-assigned from inventory with button “craft”, would make it worth to craft. So far I am not ready to waste hours looking through inventory for the necessary ingredients. I have made only one piece of armor and forgot about it.   I definitely see the devs used fighting system similar to the WoW, such as fight combos,skills and attributes, but that was apparently a missing thing in isometric rpg fights. Implementing side menu with auto-filling slots for potions, food etc without need to go inventory, would make the gameplay more pleasant. And I would get a need to use them:)   Pros: nice plot, fighting system, no bugs found so far, quick loading.  Cons: basically no character development with exception of four attributes (strength, dexterity, vitality and intelligence) flashback from Diablo 1:) Needs more hardcore by removing of the resting option and making potion and food crafting process simpler, as well as consuming food and potions. Right now without resting option I don’t see any good way to restore energy after fight, as drinks restore ~1 energy out of 100 roughly and crafting of energy potions become available quite late after beginning of the game. Minor fights tweaking, limitation of silence and stun uses, auto cast of skills (I want mage just spamming fireballs most of the time).",

Maybe not, but I'm having more fun than I have had with games 5 or even 10 times the cost of this. It seems solid and the unpleasant surprices I expected in a game this cheap has yet to show. Instead I keep getting pleasantly surprised about the content. Out of the latest 10-15 purchases I've made on steam, this is the one I'm most pleased with. And for 4 euros! I'm happy. And it is still a little bit christmas! I think I'll go get some hot cocoa and some cookies and play some more Ember.",

Should be really good. And the price is great...  Full thoughts:  Argh... I'm sorry. I just couldn't give this a thumbs up. Look, it's borderline for me. At his price, it's almost unfair to rate this game a thumbs down. It's kinda ok. Graphics ok, story seems like it COULD be interesting etc. BUT... there is something about the controls that seemed so non-intuitive, and non-usable compared to all the other great games like it that it ended up frustrating the crap out of me.  The Diablos, Titans Quests, all those great examples, even modern great examples like Grim Dawn all have a sensible, intuitive way to control. Something about the dragging, clicking, camera control combos all just didn't work for me. To a point where I got just damn annoyed. If they changed the controls i'd be back on this game in a flash. But as it stands today I had to get a refund - I'm playing Divinity Original Sin instead, and it's a great example of a control design that works. I'd be willing to re-buy it, but not like this.  Pros:   + Almost everything really + Price + Graphics + Story seems good  Cons: ---- F&amp;%^ing control system just feels so clunky I lost interest :(",

But there's no such thing as a subjective opinion; we all come in with our expectations and preferences, whether we helped create the game or not.   The project was exciting for me because it brings modern technological capabilities while hearkening back to the gameplay that made the older CRPGs great...such as the early Ultimas -- and many other (less famous) CRPG series and one-offs. They were much easier to get into and play than today's übercomplex RPGs, but that didn't make them any less engaging. By avoiding the spreadsheet-worthy elements, you get into the game quickly and stay there. (Nothing wrong with skill trees and the like, for those who want that degree of control.)  The resemblance to those older games is purposeful and carried off beautifully. The world and backstory (which was  not  my area of work on the game!) is so vast and thoroughly developed, and fits together so well, that it's a thrill to see how it all comes together at the end. The graphics (again, I'm not praising my own work here) just sparkle and surprise constantly. The combat system took some getting used to for me, but then again, almost every new game makes that same demand.   As long as you understand, before you buy, where this game fits in the realm of CRPGs, you'll see that it  more  than does justice to its inspiration.",
