Basically you are running and jumping all over the map trying to find items to help you find a way back to your moon. The visual design is distinctive and well done, if it's to your taste that's another matter entirely though. If you are a genre fan you chould check it out.",

Only cons is that the controls are a bit rusty, Trying to get all of the coins is infuriating, Thanks to areas 3 &amp; 4. Pretty chill game otherwise.",

            "review_text": "Lunnye Devitsy is a minimalistic exploration platformer that looks gorgeous and atmospheric at first, but gets old fast due to its disappointingly bland level design, tedious gameplay and lack of any interesting game mechanics.      For an exploration game it offers so disappointingly little.  Aside from a different tint and a few unique background props there's little that defines one area from another. Large portions of the world are little more than an abstract mess of shapes that only pad out the experience with boring filler.      Gameplay is basic and offers no fair challenge.  The premise is simple: you fall off the moon, and from then on your goal is to explore and find ways to get back up, which is about the only interesting part about gameplay. Each way is unique and requires its own approach, although some are very difficult to figure out without a walkthrough since the game gives no instructions.  The rest is just running around and collecting items until you get every one of them. Platforming is basic and offers no challenge... Until you get to end-game area. This is where difficulty skyrockets, but rather than the final levels being a challenge of skill - they're a challenge in frustration and blind luck.   -----------  I recommend checking out Nifflas' games instead, which offer a similar experience but with much better level design, beautiful worlds and great platforming.  Knytt  [nifflas.ni2.se] ,  Knytt Stories  [nifflas.ni2.se]  and  Saira  are available for free, while his newest game  Knytt Underground  can be bought on Steam with a free demo also available.   My review for Knytt Underground .",

            "review_text": "Well, I tried. Throughout my play of this game, I ran into several design flaws, but I kept going, to see where the concept was taken, seeing its potential.  Well, after 3 long, long hours, I simply quit.  The game claims it's about exploration, and aiding mysterious characters, but there's barely any of it. You arrive on the world and nothing is told to you. And that could be fine. But it simply keeps that way for the rest of the game. Nothing is told to the player, not even indirectly.  I usually enjoy exploration games a lot, since they keep throwing little clues at the player, little pieces of the overall puzzle. But not here. I've forced myself to play it through, to see if anything changed, but barely anything did.   The puzzles are senseless. They could make a bit more sense, if there were references to them throughout the game, that one could get through exploration. Since there's nothing, this game is about trial a error. Constantly. And it's simply not fun. You're not exploring anything. The map is just a labyrinthic mess, with fake walls that you can't tell from a normal wall. So, the only thing left to do, is roam around the world. Which has nothing special. It barely has any landmarks that could tell something interesting. There's nothing. The world feels as dead as it could. The characters are simply there for you to have a very vague idea of what to do to progress in the game, but they don't actually feel like characters. Only a chore board.   The controls aren't anything to write home about either. And, on top of it, it tries to be a hard platformer. And it falls flat on its face. With these imprecise controls, you actually have to land on the tips of triangles. Seriously? Who could've thought this was a good idea? Then, a dark block with hidden paths inside. There's no way to see where you're going. Again, HOW could someone think this was a good idea? It's just frustrating trial and error. And it adds absolutely nothing positive to the game.  The visuals did look unique, but you'd better turn off the post processing effects. Those are really, really bad. They simply blur your vision and end up hurting your eyes.  The redeeming factor is this may be the music (althought not sound design). The music was really enjoyable, although it didn't quite play into the atmosphere of the game. Simply good, random, background music.  I'm sorry if I'm being overly negative, but I had certain expectations for this, the idea seemed right up my alley. But... no. It's simply a badly designed game. In exploration games, you should learn something about the world. The world should have a story to tell. Something. But there's nothing here. I took no satisfaction from playing this after the first half hour or so. Plus, don't make it frustrating as it is. The controls aren't tight enough for it to try to be Super Meat Boy. The visual effects are way too exagerated. The map has no landmarks, it's simply labyrinthic, with 'secrets' areas that make no sense.  Too many ideas that were badly implemented. My advice would be to polish each aspect of the game a lot before trying to get it all together. Otherwise you get this. And it's not very good. Don't pick this one up.  With that said, I'll still keep an eye out for Boss Baddie, these games might actually get pretty good after a lot of work has been put into them.",

            "review_text": "My review for the other Lunar Pack game, Wake, was scathing. So I am please to say, this game isn't that bad. It isn't that good, either.   The game is the definition of minimalism, for better or worse. There are no tutorials, no menu screens, no help at all. In a way, that harkens back to the old Atari days, I suppose. If you guess correctly at the start, you will see signs that tell you what buttons to push. Of course, these buttons do not work.   There may or may not be a goal to this game. Damned if I can tell. You wander around a complex of caves and water. Seems nothing, not even lava can hurt you, but it is horribly easy to get lost or stuck. While you explore, you find items such as moons, which so far, don't seem to do anything. The game is very slow-paced, and aside from exploring, there isn't anything to do. No matter how into games you may be, you will be bored by this game.   Like Wake, the game is poorly optimized, and for all of its minimalism, feels very sluggish. Not only does the game play at a snail's pace, it runs at a snail's pace as well. It is not unplayable like Wake was for many people, but it is noticable. I have also had it crash every time I have run the game, sometimes on exit, sometimes on the start. It also caused an odd behavior while the game was running. My shift key acted like D, as did X on my gamepad, and Y acted like the w key. Somehow this game managed to make it almost impossible to type while it was running, even when alt-tabbed. Perhaps this is why the buttons didn't seem to do anything?  Despite being basically a bad game, there is some value to the Lunar Pack. If you buy this game on a sale, the card drops will more than pay for it, so you might just turn a profit. But is that kind of suffering worth it?",

            "review_text": "In this game the idea is to explore the map and do different things to go back to the moon. You cannot die so I felt pretty relaxed when playing it.  Ambience is good, both the graphics and the music are really well done. Platforming is solid, and the character handles really well. The difficulty is fair, normal at the start and pretty difficult at the end.   About the bad, the game is not really that hard to learn, but the tutorial/introduction is really bare bones and lacking. The most basic things they don't explain are: - 'Your objective is to go back to the moon' Yes, this is dumb but the game never tells you, so, if you don't know the game, you have to go to the forums or figure out by pure chance. - 'The interaction button is [up]' Also pretty dumb you don't get an explanation of the controls. I wasted a ton of time runnning around seeing if I had missed anything until I found out pressing up in certain places made 'stuff happen'.  A better introduction would have made this game even better, that's all. I really recommend it anyway, and if you read this till the end, you already know what the tutorial doesn't teach you, so you are ready... :D:",
