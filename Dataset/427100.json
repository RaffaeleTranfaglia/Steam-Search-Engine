            "review_text": "Important Edit: Valid criticism of this game is actively being trolled by the apologist army and they have the backing of the moderators who close threads that point out the many problems this 'game' has at their request. This should be the most important reason for you to stay away from this abomination as far as you can.  Review: Fernbus Simulator is at this point in time totally unplayable. It's unfinished, controls are not only user-unfriendly, they also don't work. Game doesn't recognize standard wheel set-ups and for the controller uses flight-stick controls that are so twitchy that even adjusting them doesn't help matters.  They call this a 'simulator', but it is at best an arcade-game with a psychotic coach you have to drive through even more psychotic AI traffic.  The game is a crapshoot that shouldn't have been released in it's current state. Don't buy this, as refunding is as user-unfriendly as this game is. Just save yourself the head-ache. Thank me later.  Edit: refunded the game due to the apologist-army defending the game to the death. Not willing to lock horns with that segment of the 'gaming-community'.",

Graphics are an insult for £26.99. Very laggy, the game punishes you for steering horribly even though its not the player's fault.   I seen Squirell play this game on his YouTube Channel, he seems to be pretty close with the creators of this game too. and i can see why, they needed someone who can promote this game to be the best simulator of the year, when it is an absoloute nightmare of a game. Simply Unplayable! i got no enjoyment out of this game whatsoever!  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!",

            "review_text": "Really decent sim with some drawbacks.  We have not get lot of great bus sims yet, but it seems things tend to move in right direction. Fernbus Simulator has really nice graphics, bus model and map, no doubt about it. It's really fun to operate the bus, open luggage compartments or face random encounters like roadworks. Yet, there is no economy model, map is quite repeatable (as are real German highways) and force feedback does not exist (that's actually biggest immersion killer currently). Well it does, but only on paper as it has no real impact on the game. There are still some beta stage issues like AI traffic disappearing (will be patched in next version based on statement on their forum), passengers appearing on roofs of bus stops and roadworks popping up suddenly when you are near them (draw distance is horrible), but all in all I'm satisfied and glad I spent my money on this product to help TML find their new way. It's a HUGE progress from last bus sims.",

The AI traffic does not flow correctly, leaving large traffic jams.    All the cars float on the road rather than actually touching the road.    The game starts in the lowest resolution possible and to increase it you need to slide a bar to the right, but because it is a low resolution you can only increase the size up in two steps becuase the menu is off sync to where your mouse is. You literally have to move your mouse about half way accross your screen just to click a button on the far left.    The bus does not sound realistic at all, in fact it sounds more like a car.     No matter what PC you have it will start on the lowest graphic settings possible.    You get moaned at all the time for going 1mph over the speed limit and passengers complain everything.   I really could go on but I have better things to do with my life.",

The game simply doesn't play well with it, as the sensitivity is way too high. You'll be forced to play with a keyboard and mouse instead, which is just awful with confusing controls and terrible mouse acceleration. Your passengers will constantly complain about you steering too sharply.  The game ran 'okay (40-50 fps on an R9 Fury and and i5 6600k)' on pretty much everything ultra except medium anti aliasing and high draw distance, but it didn't look all that good, okay the shadows and lighting are pretty nice, but the game just generally has a blurry, grainy look to it. Furthermore, the buildings and foliage look a bit generic and the map doesn't seem too accurate.  I also found it incredibly frustrating to constantly wait on traffic lights in the city, I've been through only one city yet (Köln), but I immediately felt annoyed by the long waiting times and the very short amount of time the light actually was green.   All in all, not really the best experience and I recommend everyone to wait buying this game until they have patched these issues (if they ever will) or the game is on sale. ",

            "review_text": "When I look at the negative reviews this game has received on Steam, either people have a problem starting the game, or they have played it no more than an hour before writing a negative review about this game. Very few of the negative reviews on this have been justifiably written, so I thought I should write my honest opinion of Fernbus Coach Simulator.  The Bus:  This game comes with two buses: the MAN Lions Coach and the Lions Coach C, which is slightly larger. Every little bit of the bus is detailed to real life; everything is clickable in the cockpit area, a bit like OMSI. What I hear quite a bit is that the tilt of the bus, when on the realistic setting, is anything but realistic. To anyone who thinks this - the developers asked real bus drivers to test the game and programmed the bus accordingly. Same goes for the engine - the devs recorded the noise of the bus from multiple locations and put it into the game. I've seen so many people complaining about the engine noise, when in fact it's quite realistic. Both buses, in my opinion, look and sound great. Definitely a highlight of this game.  The Map: TML Studios has really created something special with this game's world. Everything is very detailed (ex: random buildings next to autobahns, and tiny objects at building locations) and each city has character. You can tell the developers put their heart and soul into this map.  Graphics: When put on high or max, this game's graphics put SCS Software to shame. On low settings, this game looks comparable to OMSI or worse. It depends on what PC you have, but this game is pretty graphically demanding.   AI Traffic: AI traffic needs quite a bit of work. It's not terrible - cars stop behind you when you slow down, and they stop at traffic lights, but they really don't behave properly in many situations. When cars are stopped at traffic lights, they tend to jitter forward for a few seconds. It doesn't matter if you turn on your signal; cars will completely ignore your request as a bus driver. That being said, I haven't experienced any unfair crashes due to the AI crashing into me. So in conclusion, the AI needs work, but it's tolerable.  Passengers: The passengers actually look really nice in this game. They all look different and have individual names, and behave reasonably. This game also has, by far, the best check-in system of any simulator. Each person either has an online ticket, a paper ticket, or will ask you to buy a ticket on the spot. All of this occurs in real life, and it just feels great to check people in.  If you love buses (and Germany), this game is for you. If you want a simple game that you can jump into and play and enjoy, then you're probably going to find this game and difficult and painful to play. It's quite a complicated experience, and the tutorial doesn't tell you much. It takes a while to figure out how to operate the bus properly; it's not a very intuitive experience.  That being said, unlike many, I believe this game is a great one. Maybe in a year or so, it will be an amazing game, with future patches, DLC and mod support coming soon. But for now, I'm perfectly fine playing what I have been given on August 25th.",

            "review_text": "When purchasing the game I was a little concerned about the awful reviews with many issues being listed. There are indeed some issues but all that can be fixed fairly easily which I'm hoping TML will do. I'm not too sure how the reviews are so bad right now because still the graphics are amazing and performance is great. I'd say it's slightly better to run then ETS2/ATS which I wasn't expecting. My main annoyance is the fact that in V1 AI traffic is still going through red traffic lights, that's just not right for a V1 but still I have to reccomend this despite all the other awful reviews. The game is very highly detailed and can be very enjoyable.",

Im still going to keep the pervious revew But ive changed it to yes mainly because it was my fault why it dident work  Yes the game was released to early but TML proberly had to release it early because of money reasons.  If you want to see some footage have a look at squirrels videos of it while it was in beta. Yes the game had changed a bit but it gives a small look.  The old review :    Its as Buggy as hell currently consering when i first loaded it i was stuck on a black screen for 10 mins and when i loaded in the bottons was overlaying each other and i couldent click any of them.   In the future after the bugs have been fixed this will be a good game. TML have just shoved this out the window in the buggy state as it is with out putting the game into early builds. The unreal Graphics is good but the coach textures on the loadung screens are appaling  EDIT  Basicly according to some people the minimum res for the game is 1366x768 and im running at 1024x768 and the game is glitching because of that. By the seems the game is ment to run at 16-9 and im running 4-3 streched.",
