            "review_text": "I really want to like this game, but I just think it's too average.  This game is mostly your standard cyberpunk fair. You've got your Blade Runners, your Snatchers, your Ghost in the Shells, your Deus Ex-es and so on. It's wearing a lot of inspirations on its sleeve, sometimes a little too on the nose, but that's fine enough on how they executed it in my opinion.   Fortunately this game also brings its unique style to the table, the environments all have very brightful and cheery colours just like the characters that inhabit them, all of that makes the game unlike anything else in the whole cyberpunk genre. The whole atmosphere is also greatly supported by the beautiful soundtrack that I definitely recommend giving a listen to.  As for the story. It brings a lot of themes to the table, but I felt like it didn't spent a sufficient amount on any of them. It didn't gave me time to think about the questions that I felt the story was asking me to ponder about, and they also lacked weight so they felt like they didn't even matter that much. Personally, I was mostly cruising with barely enough interest on how they'd bring it all together. And that's weird since we're talking about a cyberpunk story, I love this genre to bits but this one just doesn't work for me for some reason.   The pacing is all over the place, I thought it was just bad frankly, because when something impactful happens during the story it's like it doesn't strike hard as much as it should. There's no sense of raising the stakes, there's no tension building up until maybe the very last act. But even then it's a very brief section and then it just... ends.   I honestly thought up until the end that there was going to be some kind of huge ruse, a plotwist that would've changed everything we thought about the story so far, so that then, and only then, the real journey truly began - but no, it just ends and it was just really that predictable and underwhelming as it seemed from the beginning. I don't know, I didn't even had expectations but I was left disappointed anyways.  Another problem I had was with the main character. The MC is supposedly you, the player, but I felt like in this kind of scenario it just sucks. He's just a passive spectator, a weird sidekick to the more interesting characters the story presents to you. He doesn't do much, really. He's a void that somehow the game expects you to fill. Sometimes the game wants you to partecipate to the events happening on the screen, but I never felt like I was that character the game was pointing at.   It's weird to say this, but I think I would've felt more immersed and involved in the story if the protagonist had been an actual established character in the game's universe. I really hate making a comparison here, but Snatcher had Gillian Seed as its main character and he was awesome. And it's not like he was really that cool, he was mostly a naive and goofy guy, but that's why I liked him. I warmed up to him throughout the story, I felt more connected to him as a player than what Read Only Memories has got for a main character.  The gameplay part is fine. They spent a lot of time putting funny descriptions to things you can examine around the environment and I really appreciated that. I love looking at useless things if the game has something funny to say about it everytime. It makes it worth the effort and it adds charm to the game. The puzzles, while cool because they are part of the story, are too simple but I liked how they made them so there's never a game over, so even if you fail one the game just keeps going in a different direction, sometimes changing pieces of dialogues or even entire chunks of the story. That's great and deserves some recognition.   That being said this game is played mainly for the story, it's a narrative focused adventure game and as such my opinion towards the game is mostly based on how the narrative is presented and executed, and the general quality of it. That's why this is a negative review: the framework of the game is fine and you could do some amazing things with it and the artstyle - paired with the music which I again recommend listening to - is amazing, but it just felt mediocre to me. It's style over substance. There are other games in this genre that are more worthy of your time.",

            "review_text": "I wanted to love Read Only Memories in the worst way; it's heavily influenced by Hideo Kojima's cyberpunk classic Snatcher, one of my all-time favorites, and it features some much-needed representation of LGBT characters and gender fluidity in a video game. Unfortunately, its wonderful character designs and great music are squandered on a sterile plot that does a poor job of rising tension, a totally vacuous and unlikable player character whose motivations are forgotten immediately after being introduced, and ridiculously banal puzzles that feel like an afterthought. Then there's the weirdly unnatural-feeling fixation on identity politics that feels like it's pandering, at least when it isn't totally going off the rails and insulting the player or exploring upsetting, half-baked metaphors...but that last part's been discussed ad infinitum in plenty of reviews already, so I'll focus on the game's flaws as a narrative and adventure game instead.  Great games take you on a journey and at the end, you feel like you've accomplished something or are at least left with food for thought. At the end of ROM, I felt like I wasn't sure what I had really accomplished or what the point of it all was. Neo-San Fransisco is too bright and cheery of a setting for its own good; moments of the narrative that are supposed to be impactful simply disappear into the background, a problem compounded by how the characters approach everything with just a bit too much levity. To its credit, the game carries a lot of chuckles and is frequently funny, but unfortunately those moments don't do much for the narrative experience. ROM is also heavy on references to genre classics and cool/obscure games (for example, I caught a groaner of a reference to Deadly Premonition within my first five minutes of playing), which isn't inherently bad, but it seems to be used as a substitute for doing anything truly unique itself. Then there's the puzzles, which add nothing of value whatsoever to the experience, as they somehow manage to simultaneously be lacking in challenge, logic and purpose.  The lack of differentiation continues elsewhere; the design of the shooting segments is a direct rip-off the system in Snatcher, which was not a good gameplay approach in 1994 but was at least understandable for the era. 20 years later, it's baffling. This is similarly a problem with ROM's interface which is clunky and frustrating, and then there's the text that is generally too large for its pixelated design; if you are playing the game on anything larger than a mid-size laptop, you will need to run this game in a window, or the blocky text will give you a nasty headache. Perhaps this is less of an issue for others, but I literally gave up playing this on my desktop after two hours and finished it on my laptop to alleviate this issue, which no other game text has ever presented. There should really be an option to adjust the text size...  I felt really let down by Read Only Memories, and struggle to recommend it. It feels like a pale imitation of Snatcher, the wonderful Konami classic it tries so hard to emulate; meanwhile, Technobabylon is a substantially better modern cyberpunk adventure game that offers a gripping experience without needing to make 'cool' references to earn points with the player. I highly recommend you skip this one, and play both of those instead.",

            "review_text": "Read Only Memories is honestly a pretty disappointing game with some great promise, but ends up lacking. Getting the good out of the way, the game really does look good, and while it's going for the retro look that most indie games fail to emulate, it pulls of it pretty well making it look like a very pastel looking Sega Genesis/ Mega Drive game, and an early 90s anime. The soundtrack it's the best part of the game, really uses a great mix of instruments and chiptune very well, utilizing it to atmospheric moments that are appropriate to the locations and moments. If anything, I recommend the soundtrack than the game itself. If you're expecting this game to have a similar level of challenge seen in Snatcher, look elsewhere, this game is pitifully easy with little to no challenge whatsoever. None of the puzzles will ever get you stumped, and I honestly don't even know why they even bother putting in combat in the game. It feels like this game wasn't really made for gamers, and with its usage of LGBTQ characters and themes, it feels real insulting for LGBTQ community, basically saying that they can't handle a good challenge. I know several gay gamers, and they're very good at the games they play, and take them seriously too. Plus, I feel as though this effects the game's story. There's never really any moments of satisfaction because you never really worked for the objective. This doesn't really help when there are moments in the game where you could do something, but some convenience happens, and on what could have been, really doesn't happen. Other than that, the plot is really mediocre. Has a very rushed pace, and none of the concepts and issues the game brings up never feels like we delved into it enough. They're interesting, but very short lived, and could of done what Deus Ex takes its time to discuss about these concepts and issues. The game really lacks good build up, which makes the game feel really empty that way. There aren't really any intense or cool moments, it just feels like, intense moments happen, but with no build up, they lack impact. There are a few entertaining characters, but most of them aren't that interesting, and feels as though they make the characters a part of the LGBTQ spectrum first, and their personalities secondary, making the game feel really shallow because of it. I find the plot mediocre, mostly because of robotic partner Turing. The plot does revolve around Turing, and I think the character is alright, it has enough personality to where you can have empathy with it, but Turing is not enough to really save the shoddy pacing unfortunately, which is why I also don't think the plot isn't necessarily good. Along with its lack of twists, build up, and satisfaction, I can't honestly say the game is honestly good. It's like I experienced a short film with a lot of fascinating things happening, but it all goes too fast, and it just ends. I really don't feel the fifteen dollars is really worth it. Just get the soundtrack and enjoy some nice tunes.",

            "review_text": "I got this in a bundle and... I'm not even sure if I should even do this review?  You see when I like something a lot, I mean really a lot I don't find my reviews particularly well written. I've never tried writing a review for Cave Story and when I did one for Shovel Knight it was just pure gushing of why the game was awesome. It was a useless script that added nothing of value towards the game.  So Read Only Memories is a cyberpunk adventure game where a sentient robot named Turing invades your house and pleads for help as its creator went missing. That is all I'm gonna say with the story since it's the big focus of the game.  I really love this game. I consider it one of my favourite indie games now. The story is well written, the characters are all lovable and memorable, the 80s retro artstyle is gorgeous and the music? Well I just bought the soundtrack so take that for what you will.   It's closer to a visual novel with a point and click adventure overlay more than anything. Its puzzles are not really complicated and the real big focus are on your interactions with people you meet. The discussions with Turing is my favourite, it's both adorable and very intriguing to talk to your little robot friend.  This game gets a 10/10 for me but even with that I can't reccommend this to everyone. It's just not that type of game. If you hate the terrible logic puzzles in point and click adventure games then I can safely say it has none of that, they cut the fat off that aspect of the genre. If you want a cyberpunk adventure that's light on the gameplay then I can definitely give this a recomendation to you.  If you're interested then please give it a go. MidBoss have done a wonderful job in creating this world. To me it's one of those games I missed out on during 2015.",

There's only so many times one can compare the color of an overcast sky to a television tuned to a dead channel.  This game doesn't comply. It proudly declares itself a 'new cyberpunk story' and goes out of its way to embrace the tropes. And that's what's best about it; it still feels like the next step.  Well, it was at times cluttered with repetitive dialogue and it could have presented an emotionally stronger storyline. The soft moments in the end didn't quite hit the spot for me even though I was fond of all of the characters I was running with.  But the game manages to subvert my expectations of the genre, which is all I'm asking for. The nostalgia for the 80s future fantasies is preserved but also updated to welcome the audience in 2016. It ignores the conventional cynicism.  ROM is both familiar and contemporary. It reminds me of reading the great Pat Cadigan, and I'm living for it.",

            "review_text": "The year is 2065. The streets of New-Angeles are riddeled with cri- actually, everything is mostly alright. The world is at the crossroads of three technological singularities. The flames of conflict engulf the peoples and the warring sides settle their differences though democracy and peaceful process.  Needless to say, the author has a very idealistic view of the future..  Read Only Memories is an old school Point and Click adventure, drawing heavy inspiration from Snatcher and Policenauts in terms of its story and presentation. You take the role of a faceless reporter and blogger who wakes up to find a sentient robot sitting next to your bed. Unfortunately, the game doesn't permit you to throw your pillow at them and scream at the top of ones lungs, like one would do in real life.  What follows is a six hour long journey of conspiracies and espionage to uncover the fate of your mising friend with a help of a sillicon companion.  My first compaint with the story is its initial linearity, you are dragged out of your appartment and are nailed to the floor to sit and listen to ten minutes of exposition, followed by another ten minutes of exposition. Though the writing is fairly adequate, one cannot but feel that it could have been compressed or layed out more elegantly.  After that tunel of love, the game finally opens up, both in terms of exploration and the lore. The story takes a turn and introduces three subplots, simply though the player's exploration of the enviorment. Survelance state, radical gene splicing therapy and naturalist movement. Unfortunately, only one of those paths ends up having a propper conclusion, which makes me think that at least some of the content has been cut in development.  However, what carries the story are its characters.  By the time the little bobble head robot asks you about your prefered pronouns and gives you a three page list, you begin to understand what kind of message was trying to get across. The writer was aiming to present a cast of stark diverse characters and achieved this goal quite well. A character isn't defied by their skin colour, orientation, but by their.. well.. character.   Identity politics on the internet are quite a touchy subject, though the creator manages to handle the issue quite well. Most authors tend to get so hang up on creating an inclusive cast that they forget to actually write it, which leads to a room filled with multicoloured department store mannequins or Skyrim NPCs. My personal favourites are the pair of bartenders you meet at the pub and the splicing activist.  After solving a series of puzzles, the game begins holding your hand and then clunches it, like a paranoid mother. After the second act, the exploration ceases and 'puzzles' become way too linear. Most players are upset when an adventure is impossible to complete without a guide or pilgrimage to GameFAQs, but this is taking things way too far in the other directions. Usually the puzzle solutions are a few pixels from the puzzle itself. Calling them puzzles would be like calling putting on tooth paste on a toothbrush a 'puzzle'.  A few minor story branches after, the game kicks you down a corridor for about 40 minutes before the end. There is one scene where your companion mentions where we could get a fake passport and hijack a car. They begins to describe a slum located away from the city, populated by outcast spliced human-animal hybrids.  Following a descrimination bill, many spliced individuals lost their homes and jobs and became vagrants. In order to defend their new home from extremist groups, many established backalley gene splicing clinics and began selling black market military grade mechanical augmentations. Having lost everything, they have shed their humanity in order to become something greater.  So, can we go there? No, instead we just talk to a few NPC's that we have already met and get the key items anyway.  The last ten minutes the game goes full on action, with stealth and shootouts, which are handled fairly well, despite not being central mechanics.  There are multible endings, each doing a pretty good job of wrapping up most of the loose ends. Some are just left hanging there..  All in all, I recommend Read only Memories or ROM (I get it now). A flawed, though fairly endeering adventure that managed to remain short and punchy, despite its linearity and pacing issues. My only wish it that it dug deeper in to the societal implications of radical transhumanism. A sequel, perhaps?  Anyway, I'm off to a gene clinic to get a cool new lizard tale.",

Edit: Though, on a serious note. I appreciate Read Only Memories more than I can put into words.   This game is a treat for the neglected minority.   You're free to input your own pronouns; imprint on the faceless protagonist as much as you'd like. No one will interrogate you. No one will make fun of you. In fact, you may find a few allies in the roster of characters!  (There's no gritty white guy protagonist to gunsling, either. )  The narrative seems vague and limited, but you'll find as you play the game there's more and more to do with what you're given. Throw a brick at a police officer, carry around a carton of milk, the possibilities and variables are yours to control. Those who call the game drab or boring really haven't explored their options. In each corner is a minigame or interaction for you to utilize.   Speaking of drab, I appreciate how colorful this game is! The UI design is suitable and clever. Not only that, but it makes the sprite work stand out that much more. The palette is a fun break from other indie games that refuse to utilize bright colors. Instead of desaturated browns and straining blues, ROM is full of all kinds of palettes. This makes each setting, each character, much more memorable.

It's set in a very plausible future and gives you a lot to think about. + Setting is interesting.

They aren't over-the-top, but still manage to all be varied in shapes and sizes and colour schemes.  You can take your time, or not. The game does make you feel some sense of urgency, but you can pace yourself without any punishment, as far as I have played.  Idk. Its fun, and the story does bring interest. The side characters are interesting each in their own right, and the game lets you be as polite or rude as you wish to be with them. Some characters like you instantly, others are snappy and defensive (some with reason, some without) and you can approach things in different ways to get your goals.

The only criticisms I can see are that the game is just SJW propaganda. Apparently it's wrong to write a couple of LGBT characters for a game, idk. The game doesn't force any political positions on the player, it just exposes them to the fact that there are people in this world who don't follow norms. After spending an hour with the game, you'll just start to accept everybody and move on.  This game is a great little story-driven adventure along the lines of Phoenix Wright or a traditional point and click. The gameplay isn't what shines here, but it seems to hit the perfect balance between being completely linear and being interactive. The music and art are both great, and the writing will consistently make you laugh. It also has some real emotions, too. Turing is a particularly interesting character, and I found myself really interested to hear whatever he had to say, even if it had nothing to do with the plot.  It has its fair share of flaws, but it doesn't ever get 'bad.'

The plot was interesting, although i felt it dragged a bit around third chapter. Last chapter and the truth about everything was cool, and i look forward to playing other endings (i did only one so far).  What was off putting though was how packed with issues the plot was, especially the part with hybrids. I don't mind that plot, but it just felt like there was too much attention brought to it, therefore making me forget what the actual plot was at times.  When i think about it now, a lot of not very plot-important things took too much time. I know it's for the sake of showing players how the world is like, but that was kind of... too much information. But i also used every chance to talk with characters and probably a lot of those long talks were perfectly avoidable, so that's not really a big point against this game... Most of characters are... okay, i guess, which was a bit disappointing since characters are what makes a game for me usually. I loved tomcat and turing (theyre so adorable, i wish i could have a robot like that irl, damn) though, so it wasn't all that bad.  OST in this game is really good and definitely worth buying it. Gives a really good atmosphere, especally during crucial moments.  Humour was... fine, i did laugh in some moments, but considering length of game and such, i mostly played it with straight face...  In general, this game didn't really speak to me and even thought i found it enjoyable and with some replayability value, i don't think i would recommend this to many people. It was a good experience, but i'm certain it's not for everyone.",

My biggest issue is that it's basically more a highly linear visual novel than a regular point n' click. You spend most of your time clicking through some overly verbose dialog, which is unfortunately quite subpar. There's an interesting story overall, although it relies heavily on well known tropes and on uninspired characters apart from the main one. After a while, I found myself speedreading and skipping through a huge amount of dialog. Obvisouly not a good thing for this kind of games, which I am usually a big fan of.  Last but not least. I felt the use of LGBT characters and gender fluidity was abused and slighlty forced upon you. Apparently, in 2064, everybody you'll talk to will keep changing their use of gender pronouns every phrase or so, without realizing how ridiculously confusing it gets, even during dramatic scenes. It's obviously a good thing to make games more open to these subjects, but IMHO it's really not the right way to do it. All you did there was cattering to a niche audience of people who are either directly concerned or who like to feel overly self-conscious. On the other hand, the masses won't probably take you seriously and may even think this attempt was somewhat rather pretentious.  All in all, I would have been pretty disappointed if I had paid the full price of 20 bucks for 6 hours of very average gameplay. In a bundle, it's alright, but I'd rather have fired up another game of my huge point n' click waiting list.",

It's easy to play on the computer with just a keyoard too, which is a definite bonus for me.  If you like story rich, kind of text heavy games that are moderatly easy that also involve cute robots, then I really think this is the game for you.

The dialouge is entertaining and hillarious, the characters are fleshed out, and the whole game has a unique charm to it.

I can tell this isn't a game for everyone, but if you like the Ace Attorney or Famicom Detective Club franchises , this is definately up your ally.

None of the puzzles are particularly mind-bending, but they still leave a feeling of satisfaction upon completion. The dialog is great. Most of the characters' lines are a perfect balance of corny and heartfelt (though I could have done without 4Moolah). I've played through twice and enjoyed both experiences.  There are a couple of spots where the game forces me to make a decision I don't feel is in line with what the characters would choose based on information they had. I get that this is used to keep the story on its rails, but in at least one case it was done so unsubtly that it gave away a huge plot point. It didn't detract too much from enjoying the game though, and really just limits the scope of the story to save a little time.

            "review_text": "Read Only Memories is very much a well crafted adventure game in every sense. You follow the developing plot in the role of a down on his luck journalist assisting your newly befriended self aware A.I. companion Turing. Deciding to set out on a quest together. In order to try and unravel the mysterious sudden disappearance of Turing's creator. Set in Neo-San Francisco in late December of the year 2064.   You're placed in a world where humans and implant enhanced hybrid humans share a shakey coexistence. Here you will encounter ominous, shady, corporate entities, a 'pure human' activist group, along with a varied cast of other rough and tumble characters. Ranging from a young detective to some even younger street punks who can help aid you along. Helping to further fuel the intrigue and assisting Turing and yourself to piece together the puzzling situation as you progress.  This all unfolds in a beautiful art style, that I would kind of describe as a mix of 80's and 90's anime, robo, sci-fi inspired awesomeness. The immediate influences from movies and gaming like Snatcher, Phantasy Star, Gabriel Knight, Akira, Bladerunner and even Deja Vu are very clear. This game isn't a bland clone however and stands worthy on it's own two legs. I consider it a very excellent first entry by Midboss into such a lofty kingdom of fondly remembered cult titles of the past from which it invokes. The beautiful pixel art, not to mention the fantastic mood driven synth music and creative sound effects makes it a pleasure for the eyes and ears.   The writing has alot of humor and offers tons of dialogue if you chose to interact with your surroundings thoroughly. Alot of attention is given to even small details. Which helps to give off a feeling of truly being immersed in this shadowy world. The menu system is very much like that of Snatcher. Pixel hunting is never really a problem, since you can usually use the keyboard itself to run through all the background to find things to interact with.  One of my favorite things this game includes, is that it allows you to try just about every option when interacting with the environment. Many times yielding some pretty hilarious results. Alot of games would take the lazy way out; just by repeating the same line over again about that doesn't work. While ROM on the other hand, makes an effort to reward your curiosity to keep making you want to explore. Of course much of this is optional and not required if you're just looking to cover the main story quickly.   David Fennoy and Adam Harrington do a fantastic job of lending their voice talents to this project. The voice acting comes off very professional and adds some good personality. My only real complaint would be that they weren't used as often as I would have liked to have heard. In fact one of the few real complaints I have with this game would be that it could use more voiceover work. I'm guessing that budget an time constraints might have played a role in that matter.   Aside from that complaint. The only problem I have with the game at the current time of writing this are with the few bugs and crashes that I've encountered. Some of the puzzle sections can present bugs which render them impossible to complete. Reloading the game seems to fix these bugs that can come up. At least on the one puzzle bug that I did encounter. Most all of these I believe the developers are aware of and working to fix at the moment. However these things can make it rather hard to gain the achievement for finishing the game in a single attempt, without having to continue or reload a save. Not to mention making you lose alot of playtime hours if you didn't manage to create a save before hand.  The game features multiple endings scenarios. The main deciding factor on how you obtain these is through how you treat certain characters. This doesn't just change the endings, but also bits of the dialogue and story as the chapters progress. Offering a good reason to replay it again. It throws in a few puzzles as well, that offer a bit of challenge, but are fairly easy to grasp. It even features a few shooting portions very similar to the grid style shooting scenes in Snatcher.  As you can probably tell from the length this review ended up becoming I was very impressed with this game. All in all I found it to be a great game and would recommend it to anyone who likes a bit of that detective noir spun in a futuristic dystopia setting. Even if you're a newcomer to genre, I think this game offers enough to keep you entertained for many hours.",

Aside from that, the game is decent, the puzzles are simple enough to be fun yet still feel like an accomplishment, and the art is very good. I do have a few complaints about the text though, for one it's annoying to read since it's so blocky. I understand that it's part of the aesthetic and style, but after a while of playing the game it starts to hurt your eyes. The text is really just a chore to read. There's also no 'instant text' option, and clicking to skip the text animation has a 3 second delay with every new message, and then another 3 second delay once you've skipped the animation to be able to click to the next message. If you're a fast reader it's extremely annoying, there's also no text skip option.  Characters seem to talk for way too long with no real point. Much of the text seems like it adds very little to the experience. I hated most of the characters, but was forced to be nice to them through dialogue even though the game brags about its multiple endings and 'freedom of choice'  I absolutely love PC-98 style cyberpunk games like Snatcher, Policenauts, and YU-NO, but this game felt like a poor attempt at recapturing that feel. The graphics don't look like those games at all, this game uses a much more low res art style which can just be painful on the eyes when playing for more than an hour or so. All of the characters have that generic 'tumblr face,' and you know exactly what I'm talking about.   I like the idea of the world, and the SJW stuff wouldn't bother me at all if it wasn't shoved in your face. I'm not kidding, the game asks you what your preferred pronouns are, options including 'They/them,' 'ze/zim/zer,' and some other abomination that I can't remember that used the letter 'x'. This all comes off as extremely pandering, especially since the game hardly ever uses the pronouns you picked. It was a complete waste of time.  If you browse tumblr you might enjoy this game. For everyone else, play some Snatcher, Policenauts, or the recently released Va-11 Hall-a, which is fantastic (though it exists in the same universe as this game) and doesn't shove this SJW â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t in your face.  4/10 decent art and style with fantastic music, but made me feel like an outsider for not being trans, which just isn't how you get me to care about these mentally ill 'nonbinary' people or whatever.
