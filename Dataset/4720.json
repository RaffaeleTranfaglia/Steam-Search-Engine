            "review_text": "Good non-traditional horror game with one major flaw--it's the same thing over and over and over again. Still, that thing (winding through the environment and fighting) is done really well, so I recommend the game.  Melee combat is pretty challenging, and you'll likely die here and there. It's kind of one of those old school deals where you learn from your mistakes. The weapons, and there are a ton of them, all have their own feel, swing at different speeds, and are fun to use.   The health system is well designed. You always seem to find med packs when you really need them. Overall, level design is really clever for a linear game with very little backtracking.  Looking at this before purchase, I wondered how scary it could be running into homeless people. Turns out, it's pretty darn scary, particularly in areas where the environment opens up and you can hear someone but can't figure out where the noise is coming from. Sound plays a key role in the scares.  To conclude, if you don't mind that the gameplay is basically the same all the way through, it's a good get for horror fans.",

As you get further into the game, there are more enemies per room and so you become desensitized to seeing shadows cross an empty hallway or hearing footsteps around you. I wish they would have limited the interactions with enemies and made them more dangerous (remove the tazer) so that you are always on edge when those types of situations arise. That being said, this is very much an atmospheric horror game that doesn't rely on jump scares (although there are a few of those too). You are scared of what's around the next corner, even if you do become desensitized to some of the visual and audio cues.  I'm not finished the game yet, but so far I'm really enjoying it. The story is engaging and the AI is incredible. If a third Condemned is released, I hope they focus more on atmosphere and less on action.",

Replaying it now after all those years, but I already know it's worth playing it. There are cutscenes regularely and there is a certain scare factor when you suddenly get attacked from behind while picking up a med kit or a weapon.  I highly recommend it.",

However, there was something special about the oppressive atmosphere and consistently aggressive way the enemies come after you that I completely adored.

            "review_text": "Condemned: Criminal Origins is a first person survival horror game that tells the story of Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent framed for the murder of two police officers, who is now on the run to find the real murderer and uncover the reason for the suddenly increased violence in the city.    Being developed by Monolith Productions and released shortly after the original F.E.A.R., you will notice a a lot of parallels between those two games in terms of story telling, visual style, atmosphere, lighting effects and so on, which, gameplay-wise, makes Condemnd a better 'sequel' to F.E.A.R. than F.E.A.R. 2 was.    The story itself isn't exactly mind-blowing, but it keeps you going and the more you get to know about the happenings in the city and the identity of the serial killer, the more it all makes sense.    As the game was originally developed for the XBox360, the controls are fairly basic stuff for a first person game. The only thing I kind of disliked is the lack of ability to jump in the game. It's not a deal breaker, but it definitely limits the freedom of movement as you always have to find a staircase, a ramp or similar to get to slightly higher places.    While the game *is* first person and you *do* get to find weapons to shoot with, I won't go as far and call it a first person shooter because the action is clearly designed around melee combat. You will find projectile weapons like pistols, shotguns etc. throughout the game, but they are rather rare and mostly only contain a few bullets. If the magazine is empty, you can't reload the gun and will have to use it as a melee weapon instead. Most of the time you will be searching the enviroment for other melee weapons like pipes, desk drawers, fire axes, sledge hammers, wood planks and so on. They all have unique stats in terms of damage, speed, range and block, so you might want to try them all out instead of sticking to one type of weapon.    Since you are a FBI agent, you also get to use a couple tech gadgets to analyze blood stains, finger prints, DNA trails and so on. At various key points in the game, the HUD will tell you to use the gear, so you will have to search a room or an entire area for evidence. It's a neat little addition and adds a welcome change to the otherwise entirely puzzle-free gameplay.    Graphics-wise, the game doesn't provide you with too many options and, like many console games, suffers from low-resolution textures. The atmospheric lighting manages to cover that up for the most part, but in brighter areas it gets quite obvious. Then again, the game was released in 2005 and considering there are games released in 2010 and earlier that look worse, one can hardly complain here.    One of the slightly more outstanding aspects of the game is the enemy AI. You will find the enemies run away from you and hide behind corners when you aim your flashlight at them, they will wait out for the right moment to flank you, eventually will beat up other thugs if they stand between them and you and so on. The AI is not that extremely complex, but then again, a lot of recent cover-based third person shooters don't manage to do that.    While the campaign felt relatively long, it only took me roughly 6 hours to beat. There are no additional game modes or a multiplayer mode, so once you are done with the story, you can either re-play it or simply move on as, apart from finding all collectible items, there's nothing else to do in the game.    So, if you liked the original F.E.A.R. and want to play a game with the same unique style, make sure to give Condemned: Criminal Origins a shot as this is the closest to F.E.A.R. you can get.",

The graphics still are decent, even by today's standards (maybe not the people so much), but it's the gameplay and story that keep it fresh.  The combination of FPS combat and the investigation sections give a nice variety to the gameplay. The idea of 'use whatever is around' to defend yourself gives a realistic approach to the combat. There is also a blocking system that works fairly well, which makes the melee combat a little more engaging. The investigations usually just come down to scanning the area for simple clues, but it keeps the story moving along.  The gameplay mechanics themselves do not sell this game, though. It's the story and atmosphere. While it gets weird towards the end, overall the story is solid. It kept me engaged, and was believeable (in it's own twisted way!). I constantly had the feeling of being 'on edge,' never quite knowing if I was safe or not. It leaves you not knowing what to trust, be it other people, the situation, or your senses.  If you want a game with a creepy atmosphere, engaging story, and fun combat, I would recommend this game. While it's not without its flaws (the story does have some pitfalls, combat isn't revolutionary, graphics do show their age), it was still a very worthy play-through.  8/10",

As I enter the room he opens fire; I duck behind the nearest column. Both guns and ammo are scarce in this game, so I knew I could weather the storm. A few shots, pause, he's reloading. He comes out again, one, two, three...four, five, six shots. I bolt out from behind the column and hit him square in the chest with a sledgehammer as he's reloading his pistol.",

I played it through once when I owned it on disc and could never go back. Now I'm here again, nearly a decade later, and I'm pooping my pants all over again.  If the movie Seven were a video game, this would be it. At the time, Monolith were killing it with this and F.E.A.R released in the same year, and both games do horror right, instilling a creeping sense of dread with such great level design that you never know where the bad guys are gonna come from, or when. Although whereas F.E.A.R is more an action game, every second of Condemned drips with oppressive tension and fear.   The fantastic mix of sound design, restrictions to your combat abilities, and intelligent enemy AI, as well as the fact that the game is fantastic at diverting your attention and then having an enemy sneak up on you, make this an incredibly stressful and disturbing experience.

The gameplay and melee combat works just fine but it isn’t really anything to praise about.

They don’t happen often so there is some tension building there for when it will happen and when it does it really gets you, none of the scares feel cheap.

The levels feel gross and creepy, the enemy designs are creative and fit the environment wells, and the combat mechanics (although somewhat imprecise and limiting, as you can only do a short block and one kind of attack) do a good job of making the game's violent encounters feel tense and dangerous, due to the methodical, animation-based fights. The investigation mechanic is pretty shallow -- only allowing you to collect a few pieces of evidence per crime scene, without requiring you to piece it together or anything -- but it's not a deal breaker, just don't go in expecting an L.A. Noire style experience.  The visuals haven't aged particularly well, but the muddy textures actually contribute to the grimy and creepy atmophere of the game's locals, so I don't consider it too much of a negative. Some of the enemy encounters are a bit too punishing (the final boss fight, in particular, is pretty bad for a variety of reasons), and the relatively simple combat mechanics don't allow much in the way of strategizing or different play styles. It's a short game (only about 6-8 hours at the most, even being thorough), but this just means it doesn't overstay its welcome.  The story is nonsensical, the writing is pretty poor, and the voice acting performances (minus your over-the-phone partner) are all pretty weak. My biggest complaint is the paranormal element of it all; I think the game's realistic modern locations, brutal combat, and grim tone would be much better served with a narrative that didn't stray so far from the realm of possibility (if you watch Zero Punctuation, you could say this game has a bit of 'Indigo Prophecy Syndrome' -- especially towards the end).  All in all, it's an enjoyable experience, as long as you're looking for a tense, atmospheric horror game and don't expect too much from it otherwise.",

            "review_text": "eeehhhh....   I actually have played more than 3 minutes that Steam has recorded because I was using the right-click context method(which sometimes Steam doesn't register - so I'm guessing this game is only using Steam as a distribution platform rather than as DRM?) to have it run on my DGPU as this game doesn't seem to be fully supported under Optimus.  Now, game's a bit dated, but despite that, my Intel HD4600 was unable to play this game maxed out with all eye candy on @ 1080p60....average fps was 20 and jumps from a measly 10 to 40 at times, which is why I obviously opted to run it on my 980M.  Ok, so you start the game off as some FBI agent solving a case and then suddenly someone else comes in and kills your campanians with your gun and the higher ups put the blame onto you as there was no other witnesses. So off you go - avoiding the cops to clear your name, stalking and trailing behind the person who killed the two guys that was there with you.   So you find out this guy is like a serial serial killer; he kills the serial killers who kills the victims but with a twist - he makes them use their own methods of killing to kill themselves with.... so off you guy, following his trail, but always a couple or so steps behind as they're already dead when you rock up. So eventually your manage to catch up to this guy and beat some sense into him, but not before an old guy comes out and knock yo ♥♥♥ down. You wake up in some farm, get lectured by the person(not the old guy), then the old guy saves your ♥♥♥ but unfortunely took of your finger but at least you're alive. So now you go into the barn and find this mysterious dude who seems to be causing the problems. You beat his ♥♥♥ and his minions and win! Well not really, at the end your character apparently turns into the *mysterious* dude who cause the problem...? idk, it's confusing...I might have to watch for an explanation or go watch #2 to see if it continues the story.....  Gameplay: You can beat down or shoot down enemies. There's also a block button so your block your opponent's melee attack and then come back with yours to knock their ♥♥♥ down! You can also pull out your taser and tase their ♥♥♥! Hahaha. I didn't really like how he passes out after 20 or so meters of running. He must be some fat guy who can barey make 20 meters before losing juice....   But the thing is he didn't look all that fat to me...so should be able to do a 100 meter sprint no problem, here he passes out after 20! Also no dual wielding, really? I get that you're probably using the left hand to hold the torch but about the times when you don't have the torch on? There's a couple of weapons which require two hands but you're still able to use the torch??! Must be shoulder torch(or clipped onto something) then or else it's impossible and if it is a shoulder torch, you should be able to dual wield! The only reason this came up because I saw one of the enemies who was dual wielding the pipes thingy and I thought aw why can't I do that too??!  Also why is there no ability to pick up ammo for a weapon and add it to yours? I'm sure he's smart enough to pick up the last two shells from another shotty to fill up yours which only has 3 to start off with so it makes 5...or a way to pick up both melee and guns and swap between them depending on situations.....  There are a couple or so jumpscares but they didn't really faze me that much because I was always mad when I keep missing swings or this fat character is too slow to catch to an enmey who's running away...hahahaha  Sound: Creepy and eerie atmosphere. The game surpports EAX 2 and 3, my lappt can't emulate EAX so I had to play without it...I could have played this on my tower as it can do EAX(all the way up to and including 5) but couldn't be ♥♥♥ really...hehehe, already had it installed on my lappy and too lazy to move files and install it on my tower...  Graphics: I suppose not too bad looking when maxed out for a several year old game at the time of course. Runs silky smooth at 60 fps with V-sync on on my 980M, but when on HD 4600, plays like crap...hahaha, unless you're used to console fps which is usually 30 fps, then I you should be able to handle 10 fps. Of course this is with the game maxed out, when I first started the game, it giving me decent fps, like 100-ish but obviously wanted eye candy... heh, so turned everything up...  Conclusion: Umm....Well, there wasn't any bugs or glitches I experienced, except that area where I got lost and didn't know how to get back out to the train tracks part and somehow got stuck in the barrels....and had to reload a save game to get out as I can't cheat my way out as I don't there exist cheats in this game.... I want to vote neutral but why is there no neutral vote?? Well, I suppose I did enjoy the game a bit so why not recommend it? Oh yeah, steam overlay doesn't seem to be working for me so yeah that's that going. COuld just be me because I was scouring the discussion forum and found some people having similar problems and some don't actually have this problem at all....weird...  I still didn't really get the supernatural stuff though....perhaps my mind isn't meant to be paying games like this...  If you like jumpscares and scary/horror(with a bit mind bending weirdness) like theme game, this is for you, if not take a pass.  ================================ Played on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M, 128GB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display; resolution 1920x1080.",

Other than that, Condemned: Criminal Origins is a decent horror game every horror fan must have. Combat AI is unparalleled and the visuals are stunning for the time of its release.(2006) Though the game might get a little linear for some people, especially towards the end, it compensates for that with it's perfectly timed scares and pschological horror theme.  Also the crime scene investigation aspect of the game is an amazing and original idea for a horror game. Simply brilliant!  I'd give it a solid 8.5/10.",

            "review_text": "Surprisingly good! Although this game predates Amnesia and the trend of notable First-Person horror games, it feels very ahead of its time. The levels feel gross and creepy, the enemy designs are creative and fit the environment wells, and the combat mechanics (although somewhat imprecise and limiting, as you can only do a short block and one kind of attack) do a good job of making the game's violent encounters feel tense and dangerous, due to the methodical, animation-based fights. The investigation mechanic is pretty shallow -- only allowing you to collect a few pieces of evidence per crime scene, without requiring you to piece it together or anything -- but it's not a deal breaker, just don't go in expecting an L.A. Noire style experience.  The visuals haven't aged particularly well, but the muddy textures actually contribute to the grimy and creepy atmophere of the game's locals, so I don't consider it too much of a negative. Some of the enemy encounters are a bit too punishing (the final boss fight, in particular, is pretty bad for a variety of reasons), and the relatively simple combat mechanics don't allow much in the way of strategizing or different play styles. It's a short game (only about 6-8 hours at the most, even being thorough), but this just means it doesn't overstay its welcome.  The story is nonsensical, the writing is pretty poor, and the voice acting performances (minus your over-the-phone partner) are all pretty weak. My biggest complaint is the paranormal element of it all; I think the game's realistic modern locations, brutal combat, and grim tone would be much better served with a narrative that didn't stray so far from the realm of possibility (if you watch Zero Punctuation, you could say this game has a bit of 'Indigo Prophecy Syndrome' -- especially towards the end).  All in all, it's an enjoyable experience, as long as you're looking for a tense, atmospheric horror game and don't expect too much from it otherwise.",

I sware my play time would have been greatly reduced had the developer chosen a walking pace beyond something of a snail, you can't jump either, except when the game tells you (climbing is the same). Combat is reduced to learning your enemies melee animations, blocking, then clubbing them over the head with the dozen or so objects your allowed to use as weapons. There are guns, which thankfully reduce the amount of time your stuck in boring melee combat, but they are few and far between, and rarely have more than a few bullets. Atmosphere, which also seems to be lauded here, is pretty much cribbed from any number of 2nd rate psychological thrillers (Se7en, Session 9, etc). Hot garbage.",

There are a lot of junkies and random human enemies too but they don't quite have a motivation for attacking you and if they were hypnotized then that's not really explained. Nothing is in fact ever explained and the rules of world is left untouched. In terms of mechanics, the game's inability to allow the player to store a gun and bullets is a major drawback and not a creative way to create tension. It almost seems like the developers didn't know which direction to approach, a survival horror (without weapons) or a crime mystery. And while they probably meant for both, their execution was lacking. The horror was fine somtimes, in fact I had a couple of startles, but the supernatural element falters heavily.",

But the game is bogged down by its very slow pace, which can frustrate players that are used to faster games.  you pretty much play the entire game walking, the character cant run/jog for a longer distance than a small room, you cant jump, crouch nor any movements other than attacking, blocking, walking or a short sprints. theres absolutely no platforming here, and everything happens on a horzontial plane, no ups or downs, just left or right. (think doom)  this can result to a boring and frustrating experience and can be tiresome at the 2nd half of the game, folks who are used to fast paced fps might also feel out of place as the combat relies more in timing than accuracy and reflexes. (you time your blocks and hits)  if one can look past the pacing and gameplay design, theres a wonderful experience to be had, but if you cant, then it can be a very painful one.   ",

            "review_text": "Wasted all of my bullets in the first level, bad guy steals my gun and threatens to kill me with it. Proceeds to kill both of my partners with my 0 bullet gun. Actually, it seems that many of the homeless drug addicts you kill in this game have the ability to literally sweat bullets and proceed to use them to kill you, since while the shotgun I retrieved from a locked safe only had 3 bullets in it, the hobo around the corner had at least 15 rounds for his shotgun. I guess having strong enemies, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics, and dark lit maps counts is all it takes to count as a horror game.  I know I've only played an hour, and maybe it gets decent further on, but I didn't enjoy a single moment of the time I played. For a game that revolves around investigating and fighting, it's got some of the worst mechanics for both.   All of the enemies I've fought so far have been actual drug addicted homeless guys that really have it out for me for no other reason than they're addicts. The melee combat is terrible. Your attacks are either too slow to attack consecutively or aren't strong enough to stun enemies. There's a 100% damage block you can use, but it's very hard to predict when they'll attack, as their recoil animations and their attack animations are nearly identical.   Gunplay is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. You're only ever going to find guns with enough ammo for one, maybe two kills. You're then forced to use the gun as a melee weapon, where's it's good for a hit or three before breaking and doing negligable damage. Why use the gun as a melee weapon? Because this FBI agent apparently decided to burn his weapon holster after his gun was stolen, so you have to choose between carrying a gun and carrying an actual melee weapon.   As for the investigating, it's so far literally just walking around with a magic tool out until you find a glowy bit, then you take a second tool to scan it or take a picture. There's one part where you follow a trail only visible with your tool, except that it's through a linear area and the story progressed without needing to use the tool. That's it. It's not any kind of puzzle, unless you count having to look at the controls layout every so often, since they didn't bother to give you any of the keybindings in game.  Another big annoyance is medkit spacing. I'll find three in one area, use one, and decide not to waste the other two, so I progress, take some damage in the next fight, but when I go back for my medkit, the previous door has been mysteriously closed forever. I suspect this has to do with the game's age, and it needing to unload the previous area in order to load the current. It's still really annoying to have to clear a whole nother area before finding another cluster of medkits. You can find some randomly hidden in closets or on desks, but in a game where one enemy can take out nearly your full health bar if you trade blows, I think carrying medkits would have been a better choice.  While I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the mechanics, the sprint feature is just terrible. You get a few seconds of hardly noticable speed increase and the bar takes ages to refill, to the point you've already forgotten about sprinting by the time it's refilled.   And while I'm at it, I want to talk about how stupid the game's premise is as well. Early game spoilers ahead.  So, as far as I'd gotten, the main motivation for our hero, Ethan Thomas, is that the serial killer he's hunting stole his gun (again, out of bullets) and used it to kill the cops I worked with. The local police force decides it's much more likely that what actually happened is a seasoned investigator decided to out of the blue kill the officers helping him on his case. At least, that's what the mysterious weirdo who showed up in Ethan's apartment said. I'm convinced this guy was just trying to make me look even more guilty by running from the police, but I don't care to play long enough to find out.  Maybe I would have enjoyed it a decade ago when it released, but compared to other games you could buy today for $15, Condemned: Criminal Origins is a waste of time and money.",
