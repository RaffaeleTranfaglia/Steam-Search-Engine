            "review_text": "Ok, I played about 5 or 6 lives as soon as it installed then had a break to compose myself... after 30 mins or so I was like 'I need to get past level 5' so I jumped back in for another frantic axe whacking rampage. Then my goal was to conquer the double digits which is when I started realising that approaching enemies with a little more tact goes a long way.  Positive thoughts so far (from a laymans perspective):   Replay value! The randomly generated levels and loot provide a different challenge each time which means no muscle memory re-runs. It also leads me to...  Random Loot! As a Diablo 1 fan this will win me over every single time. That little chance of acquiring something godlike and turning the local sprites into a fine red mist is a feeling that can never be surpassed - even if only for a couple of levels.  Hectic weapons! Ok, i'll admit it... curiousity and repeated deaths on my part killed the cat: Sarcrificing all the kittens and going god mode early on has proven enormously entertaining - especially with a suped up katana. Teleporting wildly throughout the level hammering the ♥♥♥♥ out of Mouse 1 and leaving explosions of red pixels in your wake is enormously entertaining. But don't get carried away - in the mid teen levels even 100HP won't keep you safe if you're too reckless which leads me to...  It's challenging! Particularly if you let those purple shooty ogres stun you - so watch out for them because they'll end your streak in a matter of seconds - especially if you encounter a special room.  It's intuitive: Ok there's a starting room that basically spells everything out for new players if they wish plus a comprehensive help menu BUT if one doesn't want their hand held then the basics are there from the get-go: 'you have an axe', 'you have a shield', 'there's an enemy', proceed... and it builds up very naturally introducing you to new obstacles, enemies and bonuses without any Office Assistant type interruptions.  A couple of constructive criticisms:  In the future it would be great to see new wall textures. I'm down with the pixel-gritty style of the whole game but I feel the large, repeating block textures used to make the walls let the atmosphere down a bit - particularly as the game progresses and there's no variation. These contrast quite strongly with the detailed sprites, effects and background wall textures.  I'm on the fence with the music - in some ways I want it to be more atmospheric and dark to match the dungeon crawler theme but at the same time it definitely fits the slightly retro art style, hectic combat and humour. I think a happy impasse would be to introduce a wider selection of background beats and ambience in the future - perhaps with event cues - eg hydra music. Maybe some music that creates a stronger emotional response from the player... get that 'awww ♥♥♥♥' feeling going on....  The combat is actually pretty good responsively - when I go wild with the axe it feels like it's connecting with an enemy as I click the mouse - especially when they 'splode - BUT perhaps there's room to make killing blows feel more satisfying? Get the 'Crit Crunch' effect or something similar to really make it feel like you've katana'd an elf so hard she created a sonic boom? I remember this being enormously satisfying in Baldurs Gate.  (bear in mind i've only played as far as level 15 - we will probably all look back on this post at level XXXXX in the future and shake our heads at how naivie this sweet summer child was to what awaited him.)  Wow - that was way longer than I was planning - a fridge full of vodka and ginger ale leads to a night of tireless typing.  Anyways - fantastic work, I would certainly recommend it to any curious readers - the price is a steal and the gameplay makes up for any graphical reservations anyone might have a thousand fold.  Looking forward to seeing what develops in the future!",

A lot of things tickle my interest like the crunchy sound effects, oppurtunistic combat, and easy-to-jump-into gameplay. I personally like the graphics, but don't let the graphics turn you away from the game because it is the gameplay that gets your attention.   If you got $5 to burn this is the perfect game to spend it on. Lots of replay value and lots of modifiers to make your game harder or easier to change the way you go about the game.",

This is a easy game to recommend, especially for the ones, like myself, that enjoys roguelikes titles. This one is 2D dungeon crawler platformer with new rooms procedurally generated every time you play.   The rooms aren't exactly creative to be true, they are very simple. The monsters are funny, in a strange way, and can became very hard as you advance in the game. The game is very simple in general, but its so much fun to play it. Every time i have a little break i came back to this game to do a little runs.  ",

If you want a quick review here is my take:  Pros: -Fast, easy to get into game with simple game mechanics: You get an axe, you get a shield......go nuts! -Easy to pick up controls with controller support. -CO-OP!!!! -Nice retro feel -Quick gameplay (you can jump on a few minutes and play through a few rooms and then just exit and it saves.)  Cons: -Permadeath (i personally like this it adds challenge but some don't care for it) -Music is good and does the job, a little more selection wouldn't hurt and switching tracks instead of repeating would be a nice add. -Like the music issue, The dungeon could have more variety with the walls and textures. -I used to have some in-game issues but they have been patched so the team is always testing for any type of bug.   The Pros really outweigh the cons when it comes down to it.  To put it simply, Its just a fun pixelated Rogue-style game that adds Co-op and carnage to your day!",

Here was my first experience with this game:   &gt;spawned  &gt;walked around  &gt;went to first room  &gt;picked up rocket launcher  &gt;went trigger happy against one enemy  &gt;enemy was right in front of me and I died  10/10 would shoot rockets from point blank again",

As a RPG, A-RPG, and pixel graphic fan, this game seemed like a perfect match for me.  I took a risk on buying it through Desura and once installed, I realized I'd hit pure gaming gold.

I find it hard to describe the plusus as more than 'it's fun', because that's what it's meant to be. Though I personally am not a fan of the starting over after death mechanic (at the very lease, instead of saves perhaps implementing a 'revive token' that is very expensive from vendors to allow people who have progressed to have at least a second shot at some of the more challenging areas), the randomly genorated nature makes each new adventure in the game different enough from the last that it's still a fun game to return to.

The vertical gameplay and ability to really customize your game at the start of a run feels fresh for a genre that has a lot of the same concepts, and the weapons all act rather differently, making you really want to change up the weapons per situation. While the art style isn't the greatest, it works, and makes the game feel unique. Honestly, there's a good game here, and at a cheap price.
