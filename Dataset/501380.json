    "description": "&quot;Alcatraz Island Lofts&quot;, an experimental VR short, is a dark comedy monologue set in 2025 San Franciso that imagines a rather cynical solution to San Francisco's housing crisis: converting the historic prison on Alcatraz Island into over-priced lofts. Run length is 1 min 30 secs.",
