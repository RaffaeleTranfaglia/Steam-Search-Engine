            "review_text": "Can I say this game is good? Perhaps, but with certain conditions. Firstly, it's FAR better than 'Holmes &amp; the Mystery of the Mummy' and 'Holmes &amp; the Hound of Baskerville', in terms of quality, character and logical conclusion. Secondly, it does challenge players usings its puzzles and quizzes. Now, challenge is good for these types of games, but sometimes, the answers don't quite make sense. Maybe it's just me being daft? Yeah, probably. But the game isn't particularly long, in terms of quantity of puzzles, but they are certainly sharp enough to be considered adequate.   So, graphics are better then previous games. But the cut scenes and navigation can still be stuttery. Like, whenever you want to talk to people, you have to approach them from a certain angle, and rotate yourself awkwardly.  And if you want to walk somewhere, sometimes layering can be strange, and you walk through chairs and all. But, that's not the point of a puzzle game, I suppose.  Navigation is once again an odd concern. The game  must  be played in third person. Not only that, you have to click somewhere to make Holmes walk there, and double click to make him run (you can only run when outside or nobody is around). Particularly painful, especially in the forest part of the game. But still, a puzzle in itself perhaps.  Along with puzzles are the quizzes. Basically, at the end of each in-game day, you get quizzed on everything you've collected in the day, from the clues you find, to the dialogue of people you talk to. Mind you that  answers are not exclusively restricted to that day's resources  but can actually include information as far back as the first day. This means you'll need to  remember what all evidence contains, and link it with any new evidence found . Painful, especially if you can't remember things in pristine detail, like me. At least there's a walkthrough on GameBoomers.  There are various characters that are involved, some providing more information than others. Lestrade seems particularly friendly toward Holmes though.  Interface isn't too bad, seeing as you can read your notes and do a puzzle  simultaneously . Very useful, and the best part is that  the puzzle saves your progress , unlike 'Holmes &amp; the Mystery of the Mummy', so you can go and find more clues, come back and finish the fight.  I find that the explanation at the end is quite complicated, and twist-inducing.  Would've been better if it didn't break my computer every few minutes.  Like, literally. I'd finish the credits or walk into a room, and I'd just get a black screen. Maybe a hardware fault regarding specs, but it ran fine for most of the game. But otherwise, it was alright for a game of its state.  I'll hand this one a respective 7/10. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. It turns out Frogwares actually changes the character models for Holmes and Watson in the later games, so at least Holmes looks like he's had enough sleep.",

            "review_text": "I started Frogware's Sherlock Holmes series in chronological order of the games. At this time, this is the first game in the game's timeline but was the second one made. This game is strides ahead of the first game Mystery of the Mummy. But there are concepts not perfectly implimented, but the entire experiance is enjoyable and able to get running without external software. The graphics are old but you get immerse once you get into the rythem. The entire case is really all over the place and only begin to link up at the end of the game. I suggest you take real life notes while playing it because the game has some confusing notes specificly about individuals which you need to know by your own deduction at the final 'quiz'. Overall the game is a bit clunky but I actually had alot of fun.  This is definately a point and click adventure game, but definately a true mystery case. I think this fits so well that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle could have written this story himself. I say give it a try if you want the complete Sherlock Holme's Adventure Game experiance.",

Голос Лестрейда вообще ужасен и неестественнен.",

            "review_text": "Having played through the previous Holmes games from Frogwares (I got the bundle), this represents a massive improvement compared to Mystery of the Mummy. The key crime occurs soon after you begin, and what follows is a (mostly) methodical investigation that mixes interrogation and evidence gathering/examining.  Having said that, the game is riddled with faults - a lot of the time you have to hunt for microscopic items to progress in the investigation, the placement of 'cursor spots' (for pathing and interactive points in the environment) is incredibly poor, the music is repetitive and dull, the translation for the English language version could have gone a lot better (and they could have used *any* font other than Comic Sans), the end of day quiz that summarises events doesn't tell you which answers are incorrect when you have to retry, inventory items have to combined in specific orders, and during the very lengthy conclusion, virtually *every* clue is explained, regardless of it's ultimate relevance.  Ultimately, unless you are a fan of the 'classic' Holmes, The Silver Earring will likely be a very dry, tedious experience, however, compared to the garbage that came before it, it can only be recommended on that merit.",
