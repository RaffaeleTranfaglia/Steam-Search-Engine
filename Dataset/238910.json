            "review_text": "Basically, Bionic Dues is a rogue-like mix of rpg/strategy dungeon crawler with hi-tech setting, where you fighting ever growing hordes of killing droids with your own droid. War of the machines, basic 'save the humanity from annihilation' stuff - that's all you'll ever catch about story. You can think of it as of another small thing for touchpads, but no, it's not that simple. Actually, it is like an iceberg, where major part of the game is hiding beneath the surface. And yeah, if you're looking for light walk with painless achievements - that's a very wrong game for you! While its quite easy to catch an opening pattern, farther you go - more skill and luck you need. On Every Turn.  Now, the real game is where its mechanics. You have dozens of basic options like which droid class do you prefer, what strategy will be the best with grading that given droid, and how do you planning to save the world? Destroying every enemy bot in the reach from the start, when they are still weak? Or just cutting their numbers by destroying their factories and supplies while building up your muscles for the final battle? Dozens of basic strategic options - and thousands choices on tactics. Will you prefer to raise power of single shot or ammo capacity? Range of sight or splash effect for your rockets? Stealth and traps or brute force and assault? Closer to the end of each match you'll get enough mods for your droid to make him an ultimate death machine of choice. And still you'll be vulnerable, remarkably outnumbered and outgunned in every mission. So you have to consider many steps forward. Always. And that's why I'm satisfied with that 'small looking, gross bearing' tactical game.  There are minuses, of course:  - very basic visual part. No, it is not XCom or Jagged Alliance with destroyable 3d environment, that's top-down view rogue-like indie project. Surely not for DOTA kids who are filling about half of Steam auditory.  - while it's quite easy to get along with, if you are in any way familiar with rogue-like games... finishing Bionic Dues even once can be very challenging and sometimes boring.  - if you're an achievement hunter, that game is a disaster, for to make complete of this game, you'll need to invest Hundredz of Hourz. Not dozens, but hundreds hours of your precious time. And there will be no detailed video guides, like for the Civilization, 'how to prosper on Deity'. To get all 220 achievements, you'll need to master all combinations of battle classes, beating the game about 20-30 times in average. And except diversity of tactics related to these classes, the rest will be repeated again. And again. And again...  - inventory, the part of the Bionic Dues, which makes it RPG-like, by selecting a combination of two dozens of attributes installed on your war machine... that's exactly the most boring part in the whole game. In the start, where you have about 5 spare parts, it's ok. But after 10-15 missions you'll be buried with dozens and even hundreds of items, from which you need to choose from. So many players get stacked and bored at this point! But after 20-30 hours of play you'll overcome it, hopefully. Managing one droid is much easier than all 4, and real challenge is where you making through with just one robot, not a squad of them.  Pluses are less:  - never ending challenge and need to think much forward  - many different strategies, which always should be adapted to every mission  - fantastic music! to the point where I can start a game not for playing, but just to hear that ambient again. Starting song is gorgeous! I can listen to it over and over again, for hours  Overall, I would recommend Bionic Dues to all fans of turn-based tactical games and I would NOT recommend it for achievement hunters and casual players. This game may looks nice and cosy, easy like the most of the games for touch screens... But in fact it is a very engaging time-killer.  7.5/10 saved cities",

            "review_text": "Wonderful unique turn based and creative game, fun and addictive. If you like turn based strategy games you will love this. The game is finish able even on the first try. The ability to save whenever you wish is a big plus. The interface is easy and straightforward as long as the option for mouse movement is NOT selected (If it is, then placing mines and turrets in a specific location will be a nightmare). The mission variation is fantastic and constant trying to choose which mission to do next and trying to decide when to fight the final battle adds tension to the already tense and fun dungeon crawls. There are several types of missions, and which one you choose can have a significant impact on how the game progresses. A new game starts on the city map where you choose from a web of different mission types. As you complete or fail missions, more are revealed. You win the game by either surviving the inevitable final bot onslaught, or lose when your headquarters are destroyed. There is a lot of replay ability value as your strategy will need to change depending on the lead character you select and the mech team you select. During the missions, you only control one mech (called 'exos' in game) at a time, but you have four in your stable. There is a ton of generated loot you can use to improve your exos with, which you get from completing missions, find in chests, or buy from the shop. You can swap your exo for another at any time, though it will cost you an action. You lose the mission if all four exos are destroyed. There are six different exo classes, with an epic variation of each. There are also six different pilots to choose from, each with a unique ability. A solid game, that gives you a deep tactical experience.",

Perhaps my favourite Arcen title to date (toss up with AI War). Play slowly on a difficult game or just blast through on a more forgiving level; all play styles are accounted for. Go with stealth, science, sniping, traps, or just blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything. Great stuff.  9/10",

There is a save option (which can be turned off), so it is possible to load after a really bad run. Pretty fun for a while, but end game gets repetative.  Pros: - Very clear tutorial and tooltips making it easy to learn - Save option - Sci-fi setting  Cons: - graphics are a bit dull, different units all look too similar - soundtrack can get repetative - Lack of veriety - Endgame  Fun for a few hours, but don't expect to spend 100s on this one.

            "review_text": " tl;dr -&gt; A true rogue-like game - even when you think your robots' loadouts are great, you will soon get facerolled by the enemy. 11/10 if these robots were in I Robot/Terminator we would be screwed.   I was excited to try this game out because I love the rogue-like genre. I was not disappointed, and ended up with a very satisfying - but still brutal - experience.   If you enjoy the rogue-like genre, robot theme, turn-based combat, and lots of death and loot, then you will enjoy this game.  The aesthetics are decent - the robot models and animations are nothing too fancy. The music and sounds are good, but I personally found the opening (menu) song annoying after a few repetitions. The random dialogue that the enemy robots shout out is comical - ex: 'why was I programmed to feel pain?' Eventually, I just muted all the sounds and played my own music.   The controls are simple and quick to learn. There are pop-up tutorials and the feedback when you hover over things is very helpful. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with the rogue-like genre and grid/turn-based games. The difficulty can be adjusted, and you will most likely not be playing misery for a long time - unless you are a glutton for punishment.  Gameplay is fast-paced and unforgiving - your goal is to prepare for an inevitable final battle against the robot horde (similar to the end-game boss fight in Faster than Light). You are presented with a randomly-generated map layout with branching missions. Doing a mission (regardless of failing/passing) will unlock the rest of the missions that are connected to that particular branch. Depending on the difficulty you are playing on, you will get x loot pieces per surviving robot member (aka Exo) after the mission is completed. You will also get different loot types depending on the mission you select - for example, laboratory missions will give you more computer modules. Whenever you fail, your HQ will lose a hit point, and if you reach 0, you will lose the game. Completing salvage missions will repair some damage to your HQ.  After every mission, more enemy robots are manufactured - you can hinder this by attacking robot command centers, which reduce the number of days before the final battle. You can also hunt down boss robots, making the end-game battle a bit easier. Be warned, these missions are extremely challenging, and should not be attempted until you have acquired mid- to high-tier gear. Your Exos do not level up - instead, you upgrade them with acquired loot. You can select 4 different Exos to make up your party, and you can even select 4 of the same type if you wish (this is not recommended). Examples include a sniper, ninja (stealth-based), and science (hacker/support) Exo. The character you select at the start of the game will give you different bonuses - I strongly suggest you select Tuck for your first few playthroughs because his sensor ability (allows you to see the objective and any loot containers) will increase your situational awareness greatly.  During mission gameplay, you move with the WASD keys and use the mouse to select weapons/skills. You travel as a single entity, so switching Exos will use one turn. This is critical to understand because you will automatically switch to the next Exo if your current one is destroyed - and I would die unnecessarily because I would waste a turn switching my science Exo to a different one, giving the enemy a free shot (and usually a free kill) at the Exo I switched to. You can blow up some doors, but others will have to be hacked in order to get to the loot containers within. Terminals also require hacking points, which is why a science Exo is essential to anyone wanting to maximize loot gained per mission. Many missions just require you to reach an endpoint mission marker, which is usually deep in the far end of the map. Each Exo can stealth past enemies for a short amount of movement spaces, but only the ninja Exo is able to attack while still staying in stealth mode. Some loot containers/terminals may restore your ammo, shields, hack points, or stealth points, however, some terminals may disable a random weapon or deplete all hacking points - such is the way of RNG-based games.   Overall, the game is a lot of fun if you like challenging grid/turn-based combat, and any rogue-like enthusiasts should give Bionic Dues a try.  Recommend!  Cheers, DJSF  @DJSF's Rogue Reviews ",

Basically, reverse engineer the tecnology used in the Robot Command thingmajigs to make all those pesky bots unoffensive. (Did I even spelled that right?). So then, the main characters would unite to create a mechanism inside the reactor and the main GPU's of the System controlling the bots, so then every single one would explode in the case they try to re-activate.   Or, yeah, kill all those mothertruckers and save the damn city. That makes sense.  I recommend it, it has some strategy to it. ",

            "review_text": "Bionic Dues is a phenomenal game worth whatever price you can get it for.  Essentially, all of humanity except for you and your group of survivors have been killed by a robot army. In about a month, they will attack your home base and destroy you all. You are the last remaining pilot for the Exosuit, which is the only thing that can stand between you and the robot army, and your job is to run missions to find upgrades for your suit and to sabotage the robots themselves.  The gameplay takes place on a grid and is semi-turn based. Every time you move, attack, etcetera, your turn is used up and the enemy may do something. But it runs so fluidly it almost feels real time. Your objective is different depending on what mission you choose, and that's the fun part.  There is no possible way to do all missions presented in a single game, not to mention the fact that what is available is randomly generated when you start. The fun comes in choosing what missions to do; do you take on the assasination mission and kill one of the bosses early? Do you go to a weapons factory to get shiny new weapon parts for your suits? Maybe you lost a mission and your HQ is low on health, so you need to do a mission to repair it? You only have so much time so you have to choose wisely.  On top of all this, there are several difficulty levels and several pilots who completely change the way the game played. With the pilot I used, it's sort of cheating because you start off with the enhanced suits (whereas normally you need to find them yourself). The other pilots have other passives that make sure no two playthroughs are similar. And of course, you have several different suits as well, but you can only choose four at the start of the game; I used the Science, Ninja, Assault, and Siege (I believe those are the names) but again, it's up to you. Actually there are achievements for completing the game with four of a single suit type, so you could try that. Honestly it's real endless the ways you could play the game.   I only played through once, but it took me 10 hours. I can't wait until I have the time to go through it again. If you like how it sounds, then buy it without hesitation.",

Maybe I lost some important info in one of the text walls that the game calls ' tutorials '.  But what really annoys me is the art. I guess this was the best they could afford - a guy that has some crappy aesthetic sense, and can't make proportional human-like figures.  By the way, I picked the black guy with lipstick.  *Edit: ------FUN PART OF REVIEW ENDS HERE------ Wall of text below.  Due to extensive criticism, I decided to be a bit more detailed on aspects regarding gameplay.  1. Some screenshots can be pretty misleading. To clarify this, in this game you control a single unit, that alternates between what some people may call 'stances'.   However, the game likes to say that these stances are actually, individual mechs.   Moving on - there's the assault  stance  mech (the one that shoots), the siege mech (the one that deals area damage), the ninja mech (the one that hides), and the science mech (the one that opens doors and hacks stuff). Note, however, that the assault can still do some AoE like the siege, and hide like the ninja, but not quite as effective.  2. The game is heavily based on RNG. Traps, enemies and drops are generated and spawned by a computer algorithm, meaning that your outcome on a mission can be pretty much decided by a roll of dice. You may find a bunch of chests, filled with nice loot the same way you can find a narrow hallway filled with mines. That leaves no space for skill-based (or, in this case, smarts-based?) gameplay, just frustration and unfair situations.  3. As I already said, presentation is horrible (and yes, I'm still regarding gameplay here). Not just the art is badly drawn, but the menus are also dreadful. At some point, you'll have to deal with your inventory, that will be filled with items that you got during your missions (woah, a bunch of loot! cool! ... right?). Trying to sort your stash, and figure out which item will fit best to which mech rapidly becomes a tedious task, the more items you get.  So... yeah, that's all, folks.",

            "review_text": "A competent turn-based tactical game from Arcen Games. In Bionic Dues you control a squad of four 'exos' (remotely piloted mechs) one at a time to stop the advancing robot menace. The game features random loot, as popularized by Diablo, an overall strategy screen, and the tactical map where all the robot stomping happens. You have 50 days (turns) to prosecute a campaign against the tide of robots trying to eradicate humanity. Each day you choose an available mission for your exos from those shown on teh city map. After 50 days the remaining mass of robots arrive on your doorstep, and you have to KILL THEM ALL!  For the most part the robots themselves, and the AI controlling them, are pretty dumb. The 'bots try to crush your puny human resistance through sheer numbers, rather than any sort of awesome tactical genius. On a similar note, though, there isn't much randomness to the combat itself. You never feel cheated because your stupid exo managed to miss several shots in a row, or because you didn't realize that 'bot could shoot you. All the info you need to make good decisions is right there on the screen.  Audio and music are competent. Everything sounds pew-pew and rata-tata as you'd expect. The music isn't the sort of thing I'd listen to in the car, but I enjoy it enough to listen to it as I play.  Graphics are clear enough that you can understand what's going on, but not spectacular. It's 2D, top-down, tactical game, so a step up from pixel graphics, but you can't really admire the robot models, because there aren't any.  The game isn't quite the same tactical depth of FTL, but your exos have a lot of options available to them. Equipping them with loot is almost its own mini-game, and you will see a LOT of loot over the course of the game. The biggest complaint I had of my first game was that the 'bots were a pushover. I felt like I was moshing 'bots with impunity after only 20 turns or so, and by turn 40 I just wanted it to be over because I was so thoroughly dominating them. That first game took 17 hrs to finish. There are a decent amount of options for replayability, with six different commanders and exo types (each game you have a single commander, and up to four different exos).  I enjoy turn-based tactics games like this, so it was worth the ten bucks I spent. Definitely worth it if you can get it on sale.",

Not much time to write right now, but if you get a chance, pick this up, turn based, and with CONTINUING DEVELOPER SUPPORT????  These guys, they deserve your support, this game is kickass, its a rogulike, turnbased, squad, stealth, randomly generated, EVERYTHING. Easy will hold your hand all the way through the game, the hardest difficulties, well, I raged.  Not enough time to write right now, just noticed that I hadn't given this gem a review, 110% recommended",

Has a bit of a learning curve like all roguelikes but is worth the time due to the highly enjoyable gameplay.  Could use some balancing with characters and enemy abilities. Also the boss fight feels a bit lacking and in the late game constantly applying new upgrades can get a bit tiresome. Overall addicting and worth trying out.",

Your team of exosuits can only be controlled one at a time, and unlike you the robots don't have to spend most of their armor padding a fragile meatbag in the center of their cores. Each robot has their own advanced weaponry, all of which deals heavy damage to your exosuits, and some have special abilities which can utterly decimate an enemy opponent.  Luckily, they are mind-bogglingly stupid.  This is literally a core element of the game; nobody knows how or why they managed to program insanity into their grunts, but the robots are the extreme opposite of machine efficiency. Security guards shoot water pistol damage on their first two turns. Grenade bots are constantly drunk and can't move straight. Rocket launchers are too scared to move on their own. And all of them are so stupid they can be easily hacked and turned to your side, giving you their benefits and a hardened distraction to shoot at.  Also, they are programmed to feel pain. Hearing their death cries is satisfying.  They have firepower and numbers. You have stealth and brains. Make the most of it and  Prepare To Die  And when you're done dying, leave none alive.",
