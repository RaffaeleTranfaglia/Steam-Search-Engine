            "review_text": "There is a TL;DR for those who fear the big wall of text.  The review above me is accurate, but let me elaborate:  Before I begin, no, it's not Skyrim with multiplayer. Take it as its' own thing. Also this massive wall of text is basically everything I could think about. If it seems I'm kissing this games ♥♥♥, well, I kinda am. I like it that much.  I have played almost every MMO out there. I played World of Warcraft, I played Maplestory, TERA, FFXIV, and I played Runscape for a time. I played the lesser known ones like The Secret World, Rohan, and Wildstar. ESO is the only game I have consistently played throughout the years. On steam I have 500+ hours on it already.  I started playing Elder Scrolls Online since beta, and when it first came out, it was terrible. Nothing was balanced, there was so little content. It lacked basic features that any and all MMOs have standard. Its opening day was really disappointing. Over the last year and a half this game has exploded and every time I read a patch notes I'm always massively impressed on where they are going. Little by little its becoming a true to life Elder Scrolls game. The game today is immensely cool, very balanced and a ton of fun. I don't even recognize it from a year ago. I really am sad that the initial release marked as a bad MMO.  Even from the start though, this game was insanely pretty, the character customization was on point. Orcs look like they should (finally) and Khajiits look proper. They didn't copy the Skyrim model types, this game feels more like Oblivion with updates. My one gripe about the characters is you need to purchase a certain pack in the store in order to make a any race any where. I got mine for free with my beta.  Combats pretty basic. 5 abilities with an 'Ult'. You don't need some fancy mouse or macros to beat other people in PVP. You can have two weapon sets that you can constantly switch between, but you don't need that to face stomp.  PVP is really fun. Some of the servers leave much to be desired, but the variety of what you can do is endless. The PVP area is quite massive (typical of an Elder Scrolls game) where you can either go blow up enemy factions' castles or you can quest. The Imperial City ( you need the Imperial Edition for this) is a vastly small battle arena. Its both cool and terrifying.  Questing is straight up hit and miss. I like the Aldmeri Dominion line, Daggerfall was OK. The DLCs have really good stories. World quests are just hit and miss. It feels like they started with the intention of having unique stories all over the place but reverted to using the same formulas over and over. No different from WoW I suppose.  Some people will tell you the subscriptions a waste of cash, but if you really can afford it, go for it. Its got some pretty nice perks to it like access to ALL the DLCs and soon you will have some extra customization tools. The EXP boost is nice and the monthly in game store cash is cool too.  The DLCs in this game barely are worth the $15-$20 they charge for you. They're a good filler if you have nothing better to do. All of them are scaled to max level so there will be points that you cannot cross without help, which either means you depend on someone being there to help you or you buy the DLC for your friends. Orsinium was pretty good. I am looking to pick up the Dark Brotherhood DLC soon. (EDIT I got Dark Brotherhood, was amazing!)  This game incorporates a 'scaling level system' that pulls your level and everyone elses' level to maximum when you enter certain content in this game. Character levels are nothing more than a barrier so you can't skip regions when you quest. Everywhere else (Dungeons, PVP, DLCs) they nullify them. They eliminate a barrier so you can play with your friends and then when you return to questing or doing anything on your own, you still are at where you left off. It follows what the Elder Scrolls games are all about: freedom.  The main sort of collection/farming part of this game is dyes. You can dye your gear with dyes you've collected from achievements. Most of these are easy but time consuming. Others happen by chance, and a few, well, you gotta be Emperor of Tamriel.  Crafting is the main source of gear. Getting armor/weapons to the best quality/level is a pain. It will take you quite literally 6 months to a year before you have the skills and levels it takes to make max level armor. Once you're there your friends can mooch off you.  Guilds feel useless other than grouping people for PVP/Dungeon parties, There really isn't much to them. They are the only source of an 'Auction house,' as there isn't one in the regular game. Guild stores are the only way to buy from other players at the moment, which is a drag.  Wana be a criminal? Emulate your real life? YOU CAN! You can steal, pick pocket, murder, flee guards etc. Not the best idea, as your bounty racks up quickly and it follows you everywhere. The guards in cities are unkillable, so it will throw a wrench in your ability to travel.  -=TL;DR=- 1. Combat: Easy, don't need no fancy mouse to MLGPRO someone.  2. The PVP: Its amazing. Blowing up castles, with questing on the side.  3. The questing: Hit and miss. Guild quests are cool. World quests sometimes are cookie cutter.  3. The dungeons: Pretty great. Veteran dungeons are insanely hard.  4. World bosses. I can't solo most of them.  5. The classes. Non-restrictive. I can do what I want.  6. The crafting. Good. Time consuming. Custom gear set ups and dyes are cool.  7. the DLCs: Orsinium was good. Dark Brotherhood was good.  8. Guilds: Useless but done well.  9. You can do bad things. Kill fools.  10. Games fun. Lacks some social stuff. Overall my favorite MMO ever.  This game is still rough around the edges. There still are major problems. If I wanted to, I could pick this game apart. It is in no way perfect, but it is unique. It is ideal. It's exactly what I want. As much wrong as there is with it, there is a lot of right.    EDIT 2: Updates, I'll keep them coming.  EDIT 3: Feel free to rummage through my screenshots. I try to show my friends all the cool stuff I come across.  EDIT 4: Made the TLDR more TLDR.  EDIT 5: Got rid of EDIT 1. I kiss this games ♥♥♥ too much.  EDIT 6: As part of an effort to get new players to stick around, I am opening my guild up to those who want guidance. I have many many hours into this game and have accomplished a lot. My IGN name is the same as my steam name.  This game really has grown into the best MMO I have ever played. I really hope that people will slowly understand what it is and play it.",

            "review_text": "I have played this game quite some bit. I recently decided to knock it down to one night a week. Getting burned out. ALl in all, I feel this is the best MMO out.   First the pros: Big world, fights are fast paced and veteran level content is unforgiving for those who like to not dodge mechanics. The graphics are beautiful for it's age. Community as a whole is great. Most people are very very helpful and nice (although getting them to talk with a mic is like asking them to swallow glass!). The population of the community feels great after 1 tam came out.  Now the cons. There are a ton of bugs in the game. None that are game breaking, but they do get annoying. Customer service is a joke. Bad class balancing. Used to be magic based characters were overpowered. Now it is the stamina based versions of the same classes. The downfall is all the stam based characters feel VERY generic and lack uniqueness (literally 80% of stam based skills are the same across classes). The magic based characters feel much more unique in their abilities, but their performance took a big hit after Dark Brotherhood (you can play them, but there is a noticable difference). When it comes to loot, it literally are running the same content over and over and over and over hoping your piece drops with the right configuration on it. The content for me, got old quick after clearing vet material. You are basically reduced to a chimp pulling a lever 500 times for a piece of candy. Some people really like the PVP, but it wasnt for me.   Hopefully this helps you decide if it is right for you. If you like MMOs, and dont expect Skyrim!, check it out. I think you will pleasantly surprised until the you eventually get bored. That will take awhile though!",

It is an MMO plain and simple, with an Elder Scrolls skin on it. It's fun, don't get me wrong, and some of the lore is... relatively interesting if you like that sort of thing. But many people come to it thinking it'll be different than the reality. All in all it's pretty fun, not enough to hold my interest for too terribly long even with playing with 2 friends, but interesting nonetheless. You can spend hundreds of hours and get enjoyment, or a couple dozen and feel done with it. It is by no means fantastic and I'm sure there are free to play MMO's that are better, but it's passable especially since it's no longer subscription based. If it was free as well, it would be perfectly fine by me, and probably be scored way higher in general but sadly Bethesda doesn't seem keen on the idea of making it completely free. But who knows. Decently hard too, as the final available dungeon in the first area still kicks my ♥♥♥, and I'm able to go to whole other regions with double the enemy level.",

            "review_text": "(FOREWARD) Now that i've reached the endgame and spent quite sometime with this game i wanted to leave a review. Most reviews that i've read are from people who either didn't even hit level ten or spent 40 hours thinking they could speed level through the game and found it impossible. Also to really understand this game you have to completely cut it away from the main series games. THIS IS NOT AN ELDER SCROLLS GAME. It is an MMO game with an elder scrolls theme and overtone. Also in the time since launch this game has drastically evolved. a substantial patch is added nearly every month with new content, systems, and fixes.  (REVIEW)  Graphics- I'll start with the obvious. The graphics in ESO are gorgeous. You can really see the hard work that went into making tamriel a truly breathtaking world. From The snow in Eastmarch and The Swamps in Shadowfen to the A'likr Desert each environment was crafted in a way that makes you want to see whats next for your journey.  Game World- While on the subject of the Environments the scope of Tamriel is insane. It is easily one of the largest Game world i have ever seen. Also the difference between zones is quite drastic. Sure you might see similer buildings in the same zone but that is to be expected in a game of this size.  Character Creation/Development- The Character creation in ESO is probably the most robust and fluid system i've seen in an mmo to date. You have 3 alliances each with 3 races (And imperial as the tenth for an upgrade fee) and the choice between 4 classes. The thing that sets ESO apart is the fact that these classes are not constarined whatsoever. You Want a Sorcerer with medium armor that wields two swords? go for it. Every class can use any type of armor or weapon the want with out specializing in any. The only constriction your class sets on use is the specific skill line you will use.  Skills- Logically the next step is skills. In the game you don't have a typical mmo skill tree. There are an assortment of skill lines including class, weapon, armor, racial, world, guild, and crafting skills. You literally have hundreds of options for where to invest your skills. some being active hot key skills for combat and others being passives to buff your stats. This system gives you more freedom then any previous mmo i've played.   Crafting- As an avid crafter i absolutely love the crafting system. A player is'nt confined to any one profession. I can use my blacksmithing skill to craft my weapons and armor, my woodworking skill to craft my shields, and my enchanting skill to craft runes to enchant my weapons and armor. Also the system is quite robust. You earn experience in your crafting skills by crafting(obviously), Deconstructing(which gives you materials as well), Improving items, and researching(which gives you traits). On weapons and armor you can research about 20 different traits which you can then use in your crafting recipes to recieves buff from increasing attack and defense to adding critical chance or increasing skill line experience.   Questing- Questing is one thing most people are uninformed about. Some reviews make it out to be bland basic quests. In fact it is the opposite. Gone are the collect 10 of this for no reason and kill 20 of these because i'm bored quests. Sure some quests have those aspects but every quest has a story. You might be setting up a ritual to stop a nechromancer or finding out who killed a local merchant or helping soldiers take control of a fort. every quest has some reasoning that makes it interesting and makes you want to know what happens. also many quests can completely change whats happening in an area.   Economy- This is one point that has really annoyed me. Many people are calling for a public auction house but the fact of the matter is that in a game like this Thats impossible. Eso is not based on servers. There are 2 Mega servers. With the immense population of a mega server an auction house would become bogged down with high level items which would lower the value and in turn ruin the reward of earning top tier gear. The way it is set up with guild stores makes it much more accessable. Also with the last update guild merchants have been added so that you can buy items from other guilds members. most large cities have a handful of guild merchants that will have completely different wares to choose from which helps keep the value of items.  Pvp- I am not much of a pvp player so i don't have much sway on it. but from what other players have told me it is better at higher levels and always more fun in a group.  Endgame- Now that i have Passed the level cap of 50 and entered the veteran rank system it really adds a lot to the game. After beating your factions story and the main story you are able to play through every quest from the other factions scaled up to your level. The content gets much harder but also much more rewarding. I am Only veteran Rank 1 out of 14 after update 4 released today But i will Update as i move forward.  So all in all The Elder Scrolls Online has been a wonderful Journey for me. If you go into it expecting to play skyrim you probably will not enjoy it but if you go into it looking at it as an MMO its a very rewarding experience. PLAY THIS GAME!  SCORE- 8/10  (p.s. I've played this game for almost 140 hours as of this review. if your going to take anyones word for how the games is don't listen to the guy with under 10 hours. It took me 120 hours to hit level 50. I might be subjective in my review but at least let my experience speak for me and anyone else with substantial time in the game. It gets better every update!)  (EDIT)- Seeing as no one is really understanding my meaning i thought i would add to this. When i say its not an elder scrolls game i mean that as in it is completely different then the main series games. It is a new take on the series but it still has all of the original areas, lore, creatures, etc... Giving a game that gave fair warning that it would be completely differentt a bad rap for only the fact that its different isn't right. If its too risque for you because your an elder scrolls fanboy that thinks this game tarnishes their reputation then the easy thing to do is just not play it. Don't tell everyone else that they are wrong in playing it when you won't step out of your comfort zone and try something new. Now enough ranting. PLAY IT. HAVE FUN.",

I've been playing since Closed Beta 2 and still haven't stopped. This game is extremely underrated and got a bad reputation upon release due to several reasons:     People expected Skyrim 2 or Skyrim with friends.    Reviewers did an awful job, many of which did a complete 180 on their reviews in Open Beta. This in turn, turned potential players away.    People expected a richer experience that can't be offered from an MMO at this current time.   There really isn't enough to be said about this game and its quality. It had a rocky start, but at its core, it is still the same game. Many people will deny this and say that it is a completely different game, but from those of us that have been playing since the beginning, we can all tell you that its still the same game, just much more polished.

When, without warning, a ferocious troll appeared out of nowhere, right before me, hitting me with his huge claws. I managed to keep riding my horse, desperate and unable to even think to where I was going.  To my bad luck, I encountered a group of goblins who, of course, tried to taste my delicious flesh. Some of them fire mages, increasing the despair of this humble vampire.  Riding my dear Beluhga (my frost horse) straight forward, trying to escape from that ruthless monsters, I couldn't see my real nemesis until it was too late: a cliff.  Without any other alternatives, I rushed my horse and jumped right into that abyss, hoping for certain death, but without being devoured by trolls and goblins.  But the Nines was on my side that day.  As I jumped into the cliff, a fire missile from a goblin mage hit me, knocking me from Beluhga in mid air, making me hit a tree that also appeared out of nowhere and, finally, fall into a lake.   I survived.  10/10 will jump of cliffs again.",

            "review_text": "This game received horrific reviews and impressions when first released, so I steered very, very clear of it until it went 'no sub' ...here are my impressions.  First off - If you're looking for a MMO, in a World of Warcraft, Wildstar, Tera, etc etc etc sense... This might not be for you.  The emphasis certainly seems to be on single player questing.... Think SWTOR. EVERYTHING is voice acted, and actually voice acted well. The Elder Scrolls lore is all very rich, very detailed, and very accurate. If you enjoyed any of the ES titles, you owe it to yourself to give this a whirl, if only for the amazing single player experience.  Group dynamics, for dungeons and questing... a little lacking. While it can be great fun to roll through a dungeon with a few buddies, some times getting a group together using the group finder tool can be quite a task. Perhaps that is because of low population, but I think it has more to do with the actual group finder tool just not working. There is another, REAL annoying glitch that can affect your character, because of the Veteran system, essentially forcing you to beg a Veteran Character (level 50, prestiged, basically) to join your group and toggle an option so that you can enter dungeons again. It's not game-breaking, but it is pretty frustrating when it occurs. Another rather major issue I have with the Faction system is this. You are given a choice of 3 Factions to join, each faction has 3 respective races of which they belong. The problem here is that if your friends want to play, as say a Nord, and you selected a Bosmer.... you will never play with each other on those characters. Ever. You can be in the same guild and communicate that way, but other than that, the only opportunity you have to even see eachother will be during PVP. That's it. It's a move at bolstering 'Faction Pride', I suppose, but all it really does is segregate the player base and further detract from the whole MMO experience. It is very likely that you are going to want to play a different race than your buddy, for whatever reason (RP, min/maxing/etc).   I have barely even scratched the surface of PvP, but from what I've seen Cyrodiil looks incredible. Picture a massive zone that is a microcosm of the game world. Tons of NPCs giving quests, mission boards of varying types, massive skirmishes, castle sieges.... Very objective based, not just mindless zerg deathmatch (though that does occur). You can, in theory, adventure and PVE in the PVP zone and never encounter a single enemy faction player. First impressions - this area looks like a massive hit, implemented extremely well (what Ashran COULD/SHOULD have been, in WoW).  The combat gameplay is excellent. There are no turns, no global cool down per say. Abilities use Stamina or Magicka, most enemy attacks are telegraphed and therefore require blocking/interrupting/dodging.   There is a massive amount of character specialization, in that essentially any of the 4 classes (Dragonknight, Templar, Nightblade, Sorceror) can pick and choose any of the available weapons/armours and thus unlock that skill chain. This amazingly deep system allows you to pick and choose which individual ability to put on your ability bar, allowing for some really cool combinations. I do have a gripe that you cannot save 'loadouts', and have to go through a clunky process of dragging abilities on and off to fit your particular need at the given time. Skills and Trees level up upon receiving experience, and from being present on your ability bar during exp receival. All in all, this system is not GROUND-BREAKING per say, but quite refreshing from the standard MMO fare.  Graphics and sound are just incredible. Period. If you have the system for it, crank up the draw distance and detail, and just marvel at how beautiful this game looks. I find myself periodically forgetting whatever quest or objective I have, and just wandering the lands of Tamriel simply because of the incredible ambient sound and amazing attention to detail the landscape shows. Seriously, if you like a pretty open world environment - this is it. I question how well the game is optimized, however it still runs well enough that I have no real complaints. Towns are massive, and I frequently find whenver I need to go to town for various tasks, hours go by without notice.  Crafting in the game is fairly simple, requiring you to obtain raw materials which you then refine at a crafting station and then use those for the creation process. Deconstructing items that belong to that specific profession is crucial to leveling up your crafting skill, as well as obtaining materials used for certain item traits and characteristics, including improvement. You also must research traits, in order to unlock the ability to craft an item with that particular attribute. This requires you finding a weapon/armour piece that belongs to that same family, and then spending a set amount of time (from a few hours all the way up to 32 days, depending how many traits in that family you have already unlocked) which then destroys the item in the process, but unlocks the trait for eternity.  Crafting is actually quite useful for providing upgrades for you, your alts, and your friends. Also a decent income generator. Loot is generally pretty random in the game, and if you have luck like mine, you will frequently find that you do not actually find loot for your specific character, but for everyone else, since loot is NOT personalized or tailored to your class/spec. The upside to this, however, unlike almost every other damned MMO out there, is that almost everything you find, is NOT BIND ON PICKUP! Incredible, a MMO-ish game that ACTUALLY allows you to trade! WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?  Now, before you think this is incredible....the economy part of the game is.... different. There is no central auction house. No, in ESO, if you wish to buy/sell to other players you must join guilds. You are allowed 5 guilds of which to simultaneously be a member of. Each guild has a max roster of 500 players. Joining a guild allows you access to a Guild Store, essentially giving you the ability to hawk your items to those 500 players, and browse their respective wares as well. If you're really lucky, you join a guild that actually has a world store front, which is obtained through a bidding process vs other guilds. Essentially, this allows players to visit a Trader NPC, located some where in the game world, who then lists your Guild Store auctions not only to your respective guild, but to any player who happens to wander by. Obviously, the more centralized/busy Trader locations are very highly sought after, thus the amount required to succesfully bid (which lasts a week, I believe) is quite high. It is an interesting and unique take on a MMO economy, one that many people are not fans of. ZOS, from what I understand, did not want a system in place that would allow anyone with enough money to simply hit the auction house and kit out their character with little to no effort. Understandable, but I also feel this was a rather thinly veiled attempt at combating gold farming, and 3rd party sites. Probably quite effective.  All in all, if you're looking for a very rich and deep single player experience that will have you yearning to go back to Skyrim, or for the next Elder Scrolls installment, I would definitely recommend ESO. The MMO aspect of it is.... thin, but still there. The story line is well thought out and well written, the voice acting, sound, and graphics are all top notches with a few blips here and there. Combat is never stale, and certainly not something you can sleep through like other MMOs.  With regular balance updates and hotfixes being released, I can only hope there is more great stuff to come... like... Player housing? One can hope.  Solid 8.5/10",

Now for the pros and cons  Pros -pretty good graphics --Main story line is only good because the guy who plays the prophet also played dumbldore in harry potter. -intresting quest -LOVE the character builds you can create -Dungeons -Armor creation and crafting -dark anchors   Cons -Voice chat groups would be so nice on pc instead of having to join a teamspeak or steam call -Animations for combat (only when in first person)   My Conclusion. Overall this game is pretty awesome. The world really pulls of the immersion I wanted. I'd get on only playing on playing for a little then I'd look down at my phone to see what time it was to relaize ive been playing all night. This game is probably one of the best games I've ever played and I give this game a 9/10!",

So obviously I got into it a good while after they had time to fix it, and honestly, when I got it, I had a few friends warn me against it, since they played at the very beginning. They called it clunky, slow, disconnected, and not what they would consider an Elder Scrolls game. After putting in some good time into the game, I have to say it must have SIGNIFICANTLY improved since my friends have played. The game does not lag or give off a clunky feel, and reminds me greatly of Oblivion as far as the questing goes. Things change in the games as you quest on, NPCs recognize you by your deeds, the graphics are fantastic, the animations are good, I could go on. Basically, it's a good game. If you are a die-hard TES fan, keep in mind there is only so much they can do in keeping it TES. It does feel like Tamriel, but there is a bit of disconnect that I think they can and will improve over time.  The thieving just came out, so I'm hoping for a full blown thieves guild quest line in the future, but who knows.   tl;dr, at least try the game out. Expect good quests, expect a good mmo, don't hold it up to your normal TES standards, though. Take it at face value and you'll not be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "I have only ever dipped my toes into other MMOS prior to this game (so take this review with a grain of salt), but I personally enjoy the fact that ESO doesn't play like a 'traditional MMO;'; it's exactly why I think I've played as much as I have so far. I mostly do solo player content (which ESO is great at, to be honest), as I find it damn satisying in this game. The voice acting is wonderful, I find the majority of the quests to have enough depth and variation between them to keep me endlessly entertained, and the world is absolutely beautiful. I have, however, done a fair share of the PVE content (all the 1-50 4-man dungeons, most of the delves and dolmens, almost every public dungeon) and find that the game excels here as well. The group finder seems to be lacking still, but I think it's just because most people seem to ignore it and choose to form their own groups in chat. I haven't reached 'end game' (Veteran ranks) yet or done any PVP so I cannot offer any feedback on these elements, but I will update here once I've experienced these parts of the game.  TL;DR This game can very easily play as a single person MMO if you choose to go that route (which I have) and it is a very satisfying experience that way. My decent exposure to group PVE has been largely outstanding as well. Haven't done PVP yet.",

            "review_text": "I feel that i have played for long enough to be able to write a justified review for this now, and perhaps also explain some things that i wish i had understood when i purchased the game. When starting out it does feel a little odd, as it is different to what you would expect, but when you overcome that the game is incredible, the map is huge, and npc characters and quests are great, there are so many of them to keep you going, and it is so difficult to not get sidetracked in the middle of a quest, and go and explore the world.  The community is great, something i fear may be destroyed if this game ever went free to play, which i really hope it doesn't, i am happy to pay for it. However, one thing i wish i had realised when starting was that you are limited to where you can go by the starting alliance you choose, so for example i started in the dagerfall covenant, so i am unable to go to Skyrim or Morrowind yet, however, when you reach Rank 50, or veteran rank, then you are able to unlock another area, so as i am in the daggerfall covenant, the next area i unlock is the aldmeri dominion, and then later on i can unlock the ebonheart pact.  This is not a major issue, but it does perhaps try and make you rush so you can get into new areas.  There really are no limitations as to how you want to play, for example, i am a sorceror, however there is nothing stopping me equipping heavy armour, and running around with a giant axe. or i could choose to try and be stealthy with a bow, something that if i wanted to do on another MMO, say WOW, i would have to create a new character.  PVP is something i have attempted to do, however i feel i will have to become a much higher level before being able to make a real impact.  Dungeons are great, and working as part of a team is extremely fun, also all loot is random so there is no loot stealing, as each player gets a different loot.  The graphics are astonishing, and run really well.   One issue could perhaps be that of distance, not view but attacking enemies, if an enemy is too far away, you will not be able to hit them, or if you draw an enemy too far away from where they originally were, even if you have almost defeated them, they could suddenly have all there health back and run off.  Joining and creating guilds, with so many different people is great, and people are so helpful as well.   I am finding it a little difficult to say how i feel about this without sounding extremely biased towards it, but thats the point im trying to make, so many people told me not to bother with this, others told me to play WOW or another MMO, but i ignored them, i tried WOW, and chose this instead. But seriously, just try it, even if not from steam and you buy the key somewhere else that is cheaper, grab it, and give it a go.  After playing the beta i decided to wait a while before purchasing this, and during the beta we were provided with the opportunity to play as those who would purchase the imperial edition, so we had access to the imperial class, and a horse. If you are trying to decide whether to spend the extra cash and purchase the imperial edition, then what you get is a class that is more suitable for the role of a tank, specialising in sword and shield, with heavy armour. You will also recieve a mudcrab vanity pet, which serves no purpose other than to follow you round. Also you recieve a horse which is equivalent to the 15,000 horse in game, so the cheapest one, however it is white. Finally you have the choice to play as any race in any alliance, which could be good, but i prefer to play in the factions that are meant to be played by each race.  Personally, i knew i wanted to be a Breton sorceror, specialising in conjuration, so i did not buy the imperial edition.  But yeah, i love this game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the elder scrolls.  ",

            "review_text": "Fun for both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beginning, you can have a total of 8 characters at a time. There are three factions to choose from, each comprised of 3 allied races, and all fighting for control over Cyrodiil and its crumbling empire. The Bretons, Orsimer, and Redguards form the Daggerfall Covenant at the northwest of Tamriel. The Altmer, Bosmer, and Khajiit form the Aldmeri Dominion in the south. And the Argonians, Dunmer, and Nords form the Ebonheart Pact at the northeast. With the Explorer Pack, you can play as any of these 9 races regardless of your alliance. You can still play as the Imperial race with the Imperial Edition. The classes are DragonKnight- close-range combat, Templar- healer, Sorcerer- distanced combat, and NightBlades- stealthy. Whichever you choose, I'm sure you'll find a comfortable fighting style. Your character will represent these factions for PvP in Cyrodiil. But don't worry, whichever you choose, you'll still be able to explore the other factions' territories after completing Coldharbour. Though different factions won't interact outside of the PvP zone because they each have their individual non-PvP servers spanning the game continent. I guess for singleplayer/co-op you could say there are 4 campaigns, one for each faction, and Coldharbour. Throughout the game you'll go from country to country exploring and saving the world from those darn Daedra worshippers, and gaining power along the way. There are 50 levels, each requiring more XP than the last. With each level you'll recieve a point to spend on new skills. Another way to upgrade your skills is through collecting Skyshards scattered across the continent, which of every 3 can be combined into another skill point. You can also earn a total of 501 Champion Points to spend in the Champion System similar to the constellation perk system seen in Skyrim. As an MMO, there are times when grouping is best, but when you aren't grouping it almost feels singleplayer if you'd prefer it to be like the other games. After reaching level 10, you'll have access to the PvP zone of Cyrodiil. Each faction enters though a different corner of Cyrodiil to fight for territories in a giant game of capture-the-flag / control points. There are multiple Cyrodiil servers for different preferences. New players have the option to, but aren't limited to join a server for levels 10-49, or another which disallows Champion Points to level the playing field against long-time players. In the center lies the Imperial City (DLC needed) which is overrun with Daedra and enemy players. As for the non-PvP DLCs, I'd recommend the Dark Brotherhood first for a memorable landscape, and because we all love the Dark Brotherhood. Then I'd say the Thieves' Guild because no Elder Scrolls game is complete without these two factions. And finally Wrothgar which sits right above the Covenant territory and is home to the Orsimer. Overall I love this game. Best Elder Scrolls in my opinion. I definitely recommend, but wait for a sale if you're considering buying.",

            "review_text": "The game has received a lot of bad reviews talking about how it's a WoW clone and it's really buggy, (most of these reviewers played before the Tamriel Unlimited update went live) but I don't think it's true.   Bear in mind, I haven't got to endgame yet so I won't talk about it until I have, if I ever do.   First of all, it's not buggy, I haven't played too much (around 30-40 hours at the time) and haven't found any bugs (unlike in Skyrim or any Bethesda game).  Now, about it being a WoW clone, I don't think it's true (and I do play WoW quite frequently), and it feels way more similar to Everquest 2, mainly because it's very open (at least while leveling). When leveling up, you can walk in a direction and you'll probably find quests there, but it's also really good that it's almost impossible to get lost; in EQ2 I played through the tutorial and everything is cool, but then they take me to the city (Qeynos I think) and you're on your own, so I think 'well, I guess I can just start picking up quests outside the city', and while it's true, I always ended up taking quests that were 5 levels higher than me, which resulted in awful grinding because I didn't know where to go. In ESO, by the time you get to the higher level quests, you'll be ready to do it, because they put the harder quests far from the starting zones.  Also, the quests can feel sometimes like they are the classic 'kill X until Y drops' or 'go to X, take Y and come back to me', because they are (just like in Skyrim or any other game) but they know how to hide it, and also you will sometimes get a choice and sometimes it is either the evil way or the good way, but sometimes it's not; the last one I did was about getting a crown for a noble woman and at the end, a ghost that has been helping you, tells you to release him by making the princess touch a cursed crown instead of the real crown, so basically you can give her the real crown or the cursed crown.   Combat is kinda action based and kinda targeted, if you've played DC Universe Online, it's pretty much the same without combos, (but way more customizable thanks to the skills being based on your guilds, weapons, class and so on) if you haven't played it, you don't have an auto attack button like in all tab targeting games, but your regular attack is triggered by the mouse button, you can block and dodge, and you can charge your attack, but you also have the hotkey skills.   Crafting is also a pretty big part of the game and it's actually pretty ok. I like it but it's not really innovative in any way. You get styles that change the look of the items, but not their stats (so you won't see everyone walking around in the same armor just because it's the most powerful one), and to change their stats you can: 1) increase the ingots (or leather or whatever) that will go into the creation of the item, increasing it's level.  2) use better materials, which will increase it's level even more, and change the look a little bit, but keep the same style.  3) improve the item's quality using rare items, but the upgrade's success is based on how many of this items you use, and if you fail, the item will be destroyed. But this is also the only way to improve items without increasing it's level, which is useful because you can't equip items that outlevel you.  And resource gathering isn't bad because there aren't too many mineral deposits, but you can destroy items you have to create materials.   I've only been in one dungeon and it was really fun, and it's also a bit more social due to the fact that there's no group finder so you actually have to form a group, I don't really have much more to say.   Imperial City PvP is also really big but I haven't played much of it, and if you're into PvP it could be really fun. It also doesn't feel forced into the experience, so if you like PvE you don't actually need to play it.   Also, the graphics were criticized because they're stylized or 'cartoony' but I really like them and you can play on potato PCs without any problem, I could run it in a non gaming netbook as long as I kept the graphics low.   It's also really good that there's no monthly sub so you never feel like you need to play and you can pick it up whenever you want.   All that being said, the game has it's flaws, but they don't ruin the experience (for me, at least), just hold it back.   First of all is the community, specially in Daggerfall's (Daggerfall Covenant's starting zone) General Chat, it's basically Barrens' Chat. Mostly filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. And then there's the people you'll find during your leveling experience, that will probably never respond to you and if you invite them to a group, they'll reject even though (s)he knows you're doing the same quest. But, of course, you'll also find some really cool people.   The mega server is awful, mostly because there are no 'special ruleset' servers, so no world PvP and it's also a shame for roleplayers because the only way you'll find roleplay is in a roleplay guild. And it also doesn't serve it's purpose of making zones feel more alive and having friends play with you because it has some really weird phasing thing going on.   There are only 4 classes, and even though they're kind of customizable, having more would be great.  Also, for the first 16 levels, your gear will look the same way except for the racial styles.   There are not too many dyes and most of the easy ones to get aren't really good.   One of the most important ones is that you do get that feel of 'I'm the One, but I still see 10 'the Ones' walking around'.   And the loading screens, I don't think they are that bad for everyone, but if you have a low end PC, you will have some really long loading screens.   TL;DR (kind of). After all, I think it's a great game but don't go expecting Elder Scrolls 6, which was most people's mistake, but it's also not an ES themed WoW clone, it actually feels way more open and closer to the ES experience. Also, a little advice, don't rush to endgame, just like in any ES game, you don't rush through it, and now that there's no sub, there's no excuse to rush it.   I'll probably update this review once I get to endgame, and I'll also check out the RPing community and overall experience.",

It is a lot of fun and i must say the side quests in this game are by far the best in any game, mmo or single player.  Side quest Spoiler: A random nord asked me for help cause the giants where attacking his village, i obviously agreed since i am the hero of the whole realm, Long story short the mofo was actually chopping the giants and feeding them to his comrades in an attempt to acquire their strength and rule their place... No wonder those giants were mad and attacking...  On Another side quest (SPOILER) We were being attacked by some coventant so a friend thought it would be smart for her to get captured and try to get some info from them,,, the covenant was alligned with some witches who ate human eyes... long story short my friend got her eyes fed to a witch and lost her sight forever, Sure i rescued her and killed the witches but her sight is forever lost.  And that is just a side quest but they are all like that, fully voiced, well acted and amazing stories. Its really a master piece of a game story wise. I literally think im doing a main quest several times because i think NO WAY THIS IS JUST A SIDEQUEST, but it is...  I really feel like: what kind of adventure will this game provide me next with some random side quest and off course i still have the 4 main quests, from the guilds, and the main main quest.  So it really has a LOT of content and i honestly dont think i will every finish it since i already have aound 100 hours and i literally am just a noob who only knows like 6 dungeons so far.  Just take your time with this game, it will be slow at start, specially without a mount, but once you get that and reach around lvl 15 the game really shines.  I played WoW, Swtor, ffxiv, tera, GW2, NVW and lots of other MMOs and this one is honestly the richest story wise and immersion, i really LOVE about 90% of the side quests, and i dont say all of them cause there are still some old side quests which are just crap but so far, 90% of them are like a mini main story, its incredible.  Combat is pretty good, i really feel like im swinging my 2h sword in the enemies bodies but i cant say much more cause i am still a noob who doesnt know what im doing but so far so good.  It does have some bugs but so far nothing big.  About the store i honestly didnt even check it out so far cause i dont need anything other than what the game brings.

This game has all benefits that make us to love The Elder Scrolls: great plot, lore stories, world atmosphere. You are free to do everything you did in previous games and be whoever you wanna be. None of another popular MMO gаmes allow you to make role-playing desicions throughout completing quests, to be declared as a criminal or vice versa to bring the justice by yourself and punish thiefs and murderers for reward. Quests are not about killing tons of monsters (at least while you are low-level, I'm currently 10) but you should speak with NPCs and explore the world, even in dungeons you can just sneak through the enemies and complete the quest peacefully, still getting exp and level up. In sum, you can play TESO just like you did in Morrowind, Oblivion or Skyrim, with the exception of other players who play next to you. Because of that I wanna call this game 'Online RPG' not 'MMORPG'. In MMO like WoW etc you usually set your goal to level up faster, to reach level cap and be the strongest player on server, to get the best equip etc but in TESO I want to play slowly and relaxed, to read every lore book on my way and listen all the NPC's dialogues. Btw, how much MMO's have totally voiced dialogues? =) Just another score for TESO. So this is must-have game if you are the fan of TES series or just wanna try new experience in online games in spite of high price and quite low popularity among MMO players. 9/10 and strongly recommended.",

Many areas to explore, multiple dungeons to clear, and several playthroughs to be done. Questlines are different depending on which faction you side with, and all have a good amount of things to do.

Then Tamriel Unlimited happened and this game stopped being really bad(?) to actually decent MMO, so yeah, that's where most of the bad reviews come from I suppose.   and uh ... I actually like this game, don't come here expecting skyrim online or something, treat it as a MMO with a huge Elder Scrolls theme to it. I would also suggest to try and enjoy the ride through the quests and storylines with the lore books here and there as sometimes you are given an option through a quest and it feels like every action has a meaning to it. You can choose if this guy lives or dies, and they may aid you throughout that questline just for an example  im bad at reviews, so I'll just give out my rating 7.5/10 - better than most MMO games out there  also the combat is quite fun, better than skyrim's clunky combat system, for more infomation on ESO, what better place than the main website and forums?",

Each quest has a unique, interesting story behind it and at times doesn't feel like the average MMO quest. ESO also does a beautiful job of capturing the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe allowing it to appeal greatly to fans. They have also made the game to where you don't need to be a fan to play the game. It's easily accessible to everyone else. All in all, ESO is a stunning game that is worth your time.",

Unfortunately the solutions over the last couple of patches seem to help some players while creating problems for others.  While UI add-ons make the game easier they are by no means required and you can make your way through the game quite well without them.

Ok a certain clarification about this game, this isn't skyrim and its not gonna be 100% like it that or any elder scrolls game, although it doesn´t mean its a bad thing, it take some elements from previous elder scrolls game and adapt them to the MMO style it should have since its a Massive Multiplayer Online game!  Lets start by inmersion, they really do a good job on this aspect of the game, you find public world bosses and certain events called dolmen scattered around all the map, it has collectibles and resources for your crafting jobs as well so it encourages that you explore around their beatiful made maps, for every faction i must say it takes roughly 150+ hours to complete theese maps and they are beginning to add more content to the game so it doesnt end that quickly.  Ok this is no ordinary mark target then spell cast MMO you are used to, it´s combat system its kinda unique it reminds me a bit of Tera online but way better, you have 2 bars where you can allocate certain spells that you intent to make part of your specialised build, certain spells are actually skill shots or require you to be targetting the mob with your camera so its not the usual jump and spam buttons from other MMOs, in dungeons and in pvp positioning is actually key for your success, and not only that you can actually block and dodge (dodge roll) spells to minimize their effect on you, its more action based without skipping the RPG because depending the way you built theese bars affects hugely the play style of your characters, you have a really big skill tree where you can allocate like 300 skill points in crafting passives,combat passives, weapon passives and actives, and 4 direrent classes each with 3 skill sets actives and passives as well. It´s really flexible to do a really original build ive seen crazy builds like sorcerer healers or tanks etc it really lets you do really personalized stuff. AND NO not only that! when you reach end game you unlock a thing called Championship System where you unlock points every certain exp amount that you can allocate within a really wide skill tree that looks alike skyrim tree (theese are passive skills) to tweak your character to your own needs.  Dungeon wise it has a really big spam of dungeons around 15 or more dungeons each with unique boss fights and mechanics and around 10 more End game dungeons, 3 trials (raids), so its kinda hard to get bored specially on the endgame dungeons since they require skilled players to beat, also you have with the DLCs are big solo player Arena and a huge PVPVE map where you have a hybrid of story and pvp.  Talking about PvE it has a really really big map where you fight for the dominance between the 3 factions available, with diferent mechanics, you can even use siege weapons to break down walls on Forts and so (i don´t wanna talk much about it because i dont wanna spoil the fun of seeing it for yourself).  In conclusion this game it´s a gem specially for thoose who are TES games fans, no its not a pure TES game but it uses a lot of it´s elements, and also players who just want to play a MMO can be delighted with it, specially if you are bored of the same usual MMO.",

The play style is very different compared to them, and yet it does not feel like your average MMO either. There is something far more immersive about it, and although as with any MMO you definitely have to invest many hours to rise through the levels, it doesn't exactly feel grindy either. True, as of the writing of this review I have not quite invested thirty hours yet (and I'm impatient to get to level 15 so that I can use the weapon swap system), but so far I haven't had to go out and grind monsters for hours in order to get a special item or enough experience to level up. I have several quests in my journal, but many seem to be actually thought out and you feel as though you are participating in an actual story instead of killing x goblins and y bandits in order to 'thin the ranks' of creatures that are just going to respawn.

            "review_text": "I've only got a level 8 character, so I'm quite early on. Still, I'm enjoying this game. It's the least MMO-ey MMO I've played, but it *is* an MMO. If you enjoyed something from Skyrim, it's probably in this game too. I don't think there are many people that liked Skyrim that won't enjoy this. This does play differently, but not necessarily worse.  I had a few questions going into this game, so I'm going to answer them for anyone interested. More detailed explanations are below.  Q. Can you sneak? A. Yes.  Q. Can you steal stuff? A. Yes.  Q. Can you pickpocket? A. Yes.  Q. Can you break into people's houses? A. Yes.  Q. Can I assassinate random civilians? A. Yes.  Q. How's the combat? A. Pretty good. Melee combat is arguably better than in Skyrim -- it actually feels like you're *hitting* the enemies. Everything else is at least as-good or better-than Skyrim.  Q. Can you summon weapons ('Bound Sword', etc.)? A. Not that I know of.  Q. Can you be a vampire or werewolf? A. I think so, but I believe it's a late-game thing.  Q. Can I play co-op with my friends? A. If you all start a character at the same time, and only play on those characters together, then yes. Once anyone's completed a quest, they can't do it again. So you have to all go through the same quests at the same time if you don't want to get split up. Co-op doesn't change the game much. It won't get much more interesting, you'll just be going through it together.  Q. Can you do co-op stealth? A. Sort of, but not really. If you're like me and what you want is Skyrim's stealth but co-op, with cool interesting strategies involving distracting people with arrows, silent-casting spell traps, etc. then I'm sorry to say this isn't it. (Stay hype for Tamriel Online, though). I think if you have 2-player co-op and both do stealth-archer, you could *pretend* you were playing co-op Skyrim for a little while. But at some point you'll just have to accept that the game considers stealth and combat to be completely separate things. That doesn't mean it's not fun, but it's unfortunately not Splinter Cell: Tamriel Unlimited™.  Q. How does sneaking work? A. Basically like in Skyrim, but sloppier. It's hard to explain. Since it's an MMO, everything's a little bigger, and a little laggier. So it's harder to feel like you're being 'precise' when you sneak around. You'll also have to accept the fact that while you're sneaking around a town or dungeon, other players will be running around doing things nearby. Mechanically, you can still pull the 'sneak around the pillar' trick and other classics, but in general sneaking is only useful outside of combat, for stealing and stuff. For combat, you'll usually land a sneak attack, then be perma-detected, and forced to run in swords-blazing.  Q. How does stealing work? A. Stealing from containers works as expected -- random loot is in the container. Stealing from the world is different. You won't find a 'Glass Dagger of Flames' sitting on the ground, you'll find a 'Dagger'. When you take it, you'll get a random dagger drop which is marked as stolen.  Q. How does picking pockets work? A. Rather than poking through someone's inventory, you have a % chance to get a random item from the person. Different sorts of people have different sorts of items (e.g., guards, farmers, noblemen, etc.).  Q. Is being a dirty thief boring, or a waste of time? A. No, not really. It's harder and less engaging than in Skyrim, and the world generally has less stuff to steal, but it's not unrewarding. Stealing stuff regularly can net you quite a bit of money, at least early on.  Q. How does murdering civilians work? A. People respawn. You'll sometimes see people standing over their own dead body, which is one of the more surreal things in the game.  Q. How does crime get punished? A.  You have a bounty, and 'heat'. Heat wears off quickly, and bounty wears off slowly. These are in the same bar, and bounty acts like 'minimum heat'. There are two markers in the bar. If your heat+bounty is past the first marker, guards will give you the 'STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM' spiel when they see you. You can pay your bounty and surrender your stolen items on the spot to reset to 0, or run away. Running away is a crime and adds bounty.  If you go past the second marker, guards will attack you on sight. I've never been killed by a guard, but I've been caught a lot. In general you'll get caught a lot more than in Skyrim. To reset your bounty without forfeiting your stolen items, you can pay your bounty to a fence, or wait somewhere until it wears off. Bounty wears off while logged out, so you can go on massive crime sprees before you logout for the day, if you like.  ---  Hopefully that answered some of your questions. If I remember any more, I'll update this.  I do recommend this game, though. It's often on sale for $20, so get it at that if you're interested.",

There was also issues with combat and how weightless it feels and plenty of other minor problems.  A lot of people also disliked it on its first release, and I can see why.

            "review_text": "Solid game. I doubt you'll play it for the entire duration of the game, but there is 60$ worth of entertainment out of the box. ESO could be one of the greats if they only adjusted a few minor things. Here goes what I suggest they do to 'complete' the Elder Scrolls experience.  1) Once the game is beaten, scale all low level content to the player's level. If you're lvl 50 in a lvl 1 zone, the zone should be adjusted to lvl 50. The only excdeption would be if a low lvl friending invited you to help him, then you would enter his world-space. The fundamentals of this are already in place via Megaserver tech.  2) Remove faction boundries and let all players go anywhere in the world. Make Cyrodill a Guild Vs. Guild thing instead of a RvR thing.  3) Minor tweaks to quests for continuity and immersion. Either drop a quest chain (dependent on player's point in game) or simply alter a few lines of dialogue. Not a-lot has to be done here. Other tweaks such as Morrowind/Oblivion style crafting are now implementable. Since all zones/content is now end-game content, making crafting more in line with Skyrim or Oblivion than it is currently starts to make sense.  What is my reasoning behind these three major changes? Well, it would turn ESO into a full-on Elder Scrolls game instead of an MMO set in the Elder Scrolls universe. Right now I can only experience high level versions of opposing factoin conetnt, not my own. It would give me a reason to go back and explore other areas in a way that seems natural to an Elder Scrolls game. It would let me team up with players from other factions and it would make Cyrodill three times larger and that much more interesting. It's the right thing for the game.  Now, how to package and deliver this? I would suggest making most or all of this a free update, but if development costs soar and you need some return on the investment, I would suggest selling it as a 'Veteran Content Upgrade' for say 3000 crowns. Throw in the Imperial Race on top of it. Elder Scrolls fans would feel right at home and virtually every single serious player would buy it.",

The exploration is perfect, there is so much to see and always something new around the corner (Don't forget about those random events)  But most of all, you are doing all this with your friends (sorry to the lonely losers out there who have no friends, its still fun on your own, honest) run around, kill things, explore, do quests or just make up your own story and get lost in the beautiful scenery.  9/10",

            "review_text": "Updated after One Tamriel:  This game used to be a game that was fun, only if you were willing to spend many hours in it... Alas, with One Tamriel, this is not true anymore! At level 1, you can go to the highest level places (and get rekt because you have no skills). This game is now more fun from the beginnign, as you can go to world events and places like Craglorn, and truly explore Tamriel, like never before.  Pros: 1. Character customization There are 9 different races (other than imperial) and 4 different classes. Racial passives give the races a meaning, so you really do need to pick with care. Additionally, skills are like none I have ever seen before- The skills are flashy, they feel good, are all unique and situational, require some sort of mastery, and to top it all off- your skill bars are completely unlocked. Unlike Guild Wars 2, for example, which locks the first five skill slots for whatever weapon combination you have, you can customize your skill bar entirely, which is massive- There are thousands of different builds and ways to play the game, each with advantages and disadvantages. (Just an idea of how many skills there are- Each of the 4 classes has 3 skill lines, with 5 active skills in them each. Each weapon and armor type also have its own skill line, and so does the Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, and the Undaunted. Racial passives, PvP lines, and storyline skills (Soul magic) add to this list. Finally, you can even become a werewolf or a vampire, each with their own skills as well.) There are also lots of armor sets in the game, each giving set bonuses that can completely change the way you play, some calling in meteors from the sky, and others just giving the character raw spell damage bonuses.  2. Combat Using the skills I mentioned above, combat is extremely fun. Though sometimes it feels a little bit clunky, with some odd movement going on, for the most part it is deeply satisfying and very fast paced, with dodge roll and blocking mechanics.  3. Lore All 9 of the races are very familiar for anyone who has played an Elder Scrolls game in the past. Lorebooks are scattered around Tamriel for reading and/or leveling your Mages Guild skill line, and the whole world just fits together, with factions, different cities, and different types of monsters.  4. World The map in ESO is massive, bigger than any other MMO I've ever played. I admit the world could use a little bit of saturation adjust sometimes, but for the most part it really is quite beautiful. Craglorn especially has some breathtaking sights.  5. Community The community in this game isn't toxic like many other games I've played. Just earlier today, I stripped down all my clothes and danced in front of the banker, and soon a few others had joined in... Try doing THAT in CS:GO! (   ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥!   )  6. PvP (also in cons) Apparently, 'spray and pray' is a viable tactic in PvP sometimes... Especially when you are in a group of 50 people, trying to defend a castle under siege with 50 people inside. Just set up a ballista and fire away. (This is a pro because in ESO, PvP involves castle sieges, mass scale battles, and a whole new continent to explore!)  Cons: 1. Time Though you can start endgame from the beginning, you won't be able to compete gear-wise with other players until you spend time leveling up and getting gear, come of which costs a ludicrous amount of money...  2. Glitches There are some glitches in this game that have yet to be ironed out, such as the running animation playing when I am on my horse, and getting stuck inside a mountain. But, they are few and far between, and aren't much of a problem.  3. Imperial race If you pay extra, you can make characters with the Imperial race, which happens to be the undisputed champion of which class is the best class. It's not game-breaking by any means, or even close to it, but this race definitely the best for people looking to play as a tank or have a bit extra survivability.  4. PvP I recently stopped playing PvP entirely. It's fun, and sieging a castle or ganking enemy players is very rewarding, but... the classes just aren't balanced. In PvE, all the classes are fairly balanced, and you can get into a party as any class. In PvP though, magicka templar soars above the other classes, dealing the most damage as well as being able to stay at max health constantly. Then, below Magplar comes pretty much every stamina class, being able to use a few skills over and over that do far more damage than magicka ones (Dawnbreaker, lethal arrow, poison injection, reverse slice...). Unless you are a stamina build or a magplar, don't even bother playing PvP. MagDK is alright, but... just can't compete on the same level as the others.    Not gonna lie, thats about it. Note that the first con is significant though, and think about how much time you are willing to spend in this game before you get it!  ",

ESO is a MMORPG with great graphics, soundtrack, exploration, quests, PvP and so on. There is so much content involved in ESO that the new dlcs released every now and again offer over hours and hours of new content for each player. Having 3 pacts is wise as it cancels out a generic 1v1 pact vs pact mentality as you have Aldmeri Dominion, Ebonheart Pact and finally Daggerfall Covenant. The quest lines are solid enough to keep you engaged and if you're a solo player then look no futher than this game as it offers a vast majority of solo content as far as crafting and PvE go. This game isn't pay 2 win at all as for example when you enter PvP you're counted already as a veteran ranked player which makes gameplay less one sided for a player. All in all I can easily recommend this game as a top 5 MMORPG in the world today matching qualities with games such as GW2 and WoW. I give ESO a great 9/10.",

            "review_text": "Verdict: cautious recommendation. Buy it if it's on sale, but not at full price (for now, at least).   Upsides:  + Art : Environment Design is mostly up there on par with Skyrim (and sometimes even more imaginative, as devs were not afraid to use the vertical space to their advantage). Textures are generally nice, though they could use an optional 'HD texture pack'. Though I also understand that said pack would make the installation weigh more than a hundred gigs, and would be a nightmare to update. Lighting system is quite impressive, and lits the interiors way better than, say, Skyrim engine would, shadows interact with lights in numerous ways and are always dynamic - all this results in a remarkable picture, even if some shaders are a bit basic.  + Script : I can safely say that I met a whole lot more memorable characters in TES:Online than I had in TES5. Apart from defined characters, a good dose of humour is applied even in some dramatic situations, like, for example, when you meet a vampire cat /ahem, khajiit/, who tries to save last few villagers from being eaten alive, and she is distracted by a thought of yarn. In spite of some players crying 'DEY BROKE DA LORE' 'DEY RUENED DA ALDUR SCRULS' I didn't see many violations, more so considering how inconsistent the 'canon' lore is. Cyrodiil still has no jungles, but that has more to do with Bethesda's decision during TES4 development than anything else. The so-called 'Main quest' is used more like a plot device in order to explain some events in the game world, though it does have its  bright  moments too.  + Voice-over : the amount of dialogue is immense, and it's fully voiced in its entirety. While there are few characters, who will make you cringe (that last Ayleid king, urrrgh), there are more than a few splendid jobs (even Sheogorath, which is not voiced by the original actor, but is still totally fine).  + PvP as idea : Having a full-fledged war with melee weapons, siege machinery and thousands of participants - looks great on paper. Too bad that this concept is undermined by balance and stability issues. More on those below.  + UI modding system : TES5 had a fair share of UI mods (mostly due to its UI being console-oriented in the first place). TES:Online supports this kind of mods as well with per-character settings, so if you don't like something about the interface, there's generally 'a mod for that': mini-maps, map markers, HUD overhauls, trading helpers, combat macros and whatnot.  + Amount of content : while you have to choose your starting ('home' so to speak) faction, you'll eventually get access to the zones of other factions as well. And it really does feel like three games worth of content (or time you spend on them at least).  Now on to some YMMW things (you might like these, you might hate these):  ~ Subscription model : it has its own upsides and downsides, huge upside being no teenage trolls spamming in chat or doing /playdead + /pushups on the town square (like they did in open beta). Downside being that by paying a fixed amount of money you won't necessarily get a steady amount of content (in fact, the only big content addition to the game was Craglorn). Arguably there's no better model choice - and most certainly I wouldn't want this game to become Free-to-Play.  ~ Character models : yes, mouth animations are finally added in Update 5, so people don't look like sock puppets. They still look like dolls, though. Just a pair of skin/eye shaders would work wonders here, but it seems like devs don't want to increase the budget even for close-up shots.  ~ Skillbar ala Warcraft 3 : five skills + Ulti, with additional second bar after Level 15. Unlike in TES5, you cannot dual-wield a spell and a weapon. In fact, you don't actually have any spells. Instead you have abilities, which might or might not be magical, and may produce various types of damage or have other effects on you, your allies or your enemies. So in short, Warcraft 3. DEY RUENED DA ALDUR SCRULS. Yeah, right.  ~ Game is overpopulated : you heard it correctly, and no, it's not a LITERELY DED GAEM by any means. So good luck finishing any dungeon on your own - more often than not you'll get inside just to find half of it already decimated by players, who got in a few minutes before you. On the other hand, you'll have no issues with finding a party. Party will find YOU, comrade.  And at last, let's discuss the flaws:  - The world is static . Your actions may have only a few different outcomes: a) enemies disappear from the area b) enemies become non-hostile in the area c) area is not changed in any way. No crumbling cities, no dynamic objects (the about only example of those is sky anchor, which pops every 10 minutes in predefined places), game sometimes tries to mitigate it by sending you into 'fake' zone, which becomes a 'true' zone once you complete the quest and return to it. To be fair, the devs did use a few dynamic objects in the main quest line, but that's far too few.  - Justice (absence of it) . Second-era Tamriel is populated with communists. No possession, no stealing, no jails. From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. This also means no Thieves Guild, no Dark Brotherhood, no Morag-Tong. Devs promised to introduce this system in one of the upcoming updates, so this might change in the future.  - PvP in current implementation : when it works, it's an okay experience. You deploy siege machines, employ cover-up and deceit tactics, ambush the reinforcements et cetera. The key is 'when it works'. Game uses several servers (called Campaigns), with most players going to Thornblade. It's almost always population-locked on evenings, but that's not the main concern. Once you get inside, be ready to meet the almighty LAG. While the in-game counter breaks upon latency &gt;1 s, the actual lag spike in &gt;30 x &gt;30 battles may freeze everyone in place (while you still can move around, that's an illusion made by lag compensation system) for up to several minutes. Thus taking any given fort may become an impossible feat even with prevailing forces. Currently some guilds have decided to just ditch the Thornblade and play on alternative servers. Though those might have some lag spikes time-to-time, but not any of same scale as Thornblade. Again, devs promised to fix these issues in upcoming updates, but until then this remains a flaw.  - You can't make a bad guy character. Also, you have a choice. But really, you don't : this probably applies to the last two TES games as well, but yeah, it still is a flaw. Your choice is in most cases reduced to dialogue options before being given a reward, and generally only decides if that one character will greet you upon your final appearance in the current zone. Again, nothing out of ordinary for TES series, yet still.  - Autoleveling (absence of it) . Okay, the TES4 was disliked by many for this, but TES5 used autoleveling to its advantage - if you go into a cave at Level 50, be prepared to meet bandits in glass armour or Draugr deathlords. In TES:Online if you go to, say, Glenumbra, to do some quests you missed, while you are already past Level 20, you'll find it extremely easy. In fact, many do miss the 'Bad man hallows' public dungeon, and when they return from the next zone to complete it, players just molest everyone inside. Another example: you completed every available group dungeon and played a few evenings in PvP zone. Then you return to usual questing and discover, that you are 5-6 levels above than the quest enemies/rewards. This means you get little to no items/experience for your activity, and basically robbed yourself of potentially good items, as they don't drop if you're more than 5 levels above your victims. The last update did fix some of the leveling issues, mainly with solo/group-only content.",

There are some bugs of course, but because I waited so long to play it, most of these are ironed out.   The community has been friendly so far, and those who attempt to bring the Barrens Chat mentality into ESO are quickly ignored by most.   Overall it has been a fun game with plenty of new experiences and a helpful community. If this is what you enjoy in an MMO, pick this one up!",

In conclusion I can see what some people might not like about it, but I think that it happened as part of becoming an MMO, if you look at it more like an MMO I dont find it to be bad at all.

I haven't completed the main story or either faction story, but from what I've seen they're pretty interesting. The gameplay is very much like most MMOs, but with a bit of The Elder Scrolls games that we all know and love thrown into the mix. Also, this game has one of the best playerbases in any games I've played, with a plethora of guilds being dedicated to the different activities in the game i.e. PvP, crafting, trading, etc. and helping new players. Although, this game does still have quite a few bugs after 2 years, and with each update, even though bugs are patched, there are a few new ones.  The game has 4 classes (Dragonknight, Sorcerer, Nightblade, and Templar) with 3 alliances (Aldmeri Dominion, Daggerfall Covenant, and Ebonheart Pact) and 9 races (10 with Imperial Edition. Races are Breton, Reguard, Orc, Nord, Argonian, Dark Elf, Khajiit, Wood Elf, High Elf, and Imperial) with each race (save for Imperial) being locked to one of the 3 alliances unless you have the Adventurer Pack from the crown store.  If you buy the game through steam, you have to buy crowns (the game's premium currency used for special mounts, XP boosts, and even the DLC) through Steam, but I don't see that as a big deal. There's also a subscription service called ESO Plus that gives players access to all of the DLC as long as you're subscribed, 1500 crowns every month, a dedicated crafting bag with infinite inventory for crafting materials, and a 10% bonus to character progression. ESO Plus, however, can NOT be payed for through steam and must be done at the website.  I do not think this game warrants the $60 and $80 price tag after 2 years, but unless you can't wait, I suggest you wait for the game to go on sale. Although, if you can't afford the Imperial Edition, you are able to buy the upgrade to it through the Crown store.  Overall, this is a great game with solid gameplay and a great playerbase with a premium currency and subscription service with worthwhile benefits.",

Everything is beautiful and the world is near-perfect. The only problem I had with this game in terms of graphical splendor was when I saw a texture seam in one of the main dungeons.  The class system is glorious and the gameplay is worthwhile.  Many games have too many classes to choose from. this one only has four and those four are the only four we'll ever need. I myself am a templar, and I find the gameplay is seamless and enjoyable no matter how many hits I have to make on an enemy due to the game's MMORPG nature.  The Crown Store is kind of unfortunate.  In an otherwise perfect game, there is an unsightly blemish upon the visage of Elder Scrolls Online. That blemish is the Crown Store. Given that the game requires you to spend money to get into it at all, I find that the fact that we have to buy things additional if we want to become part of the Dark Brotherhood or The Thieves Guild quite unfortunate. New PVP areas, I understand and can sympathise with, but I do not like the idea of having to pay money on top of money for a thing that should be part of a free update.  The inability to choose which faction to join solely because argonians are your favorite is pretty uncool.  I wanted to become an argonian in the Daggerfall Covenant, but that was not an option. I am disappointed in this design choice, despite the whole thing about us all being on our own sides due to our race. I'm not sure if it's even part of One Tamriel that I can join Daggerfall Covenant later on. The whole thing is just really annoying.  The Argonian voice actors are pretty terrible sometimes.  I mean, Some of them sound like robots. I am troubled deeply by this.  Overall, this game is a must-have at its current price.  As of writing this review, the game is only ten dollars without all the DLC packs. This makes it an absolute steal. If you have ten dollars, a good computer, and a lot of free time, there is truly no reason for you to not purchase this game. The negatives are absolutely nothing when compared to the positives.",

Don' get me wrong though I love how the game looks and it's similar to Skyrim. It has first person combat, skyrim-like hud, huge open world and voice acted quests. As an ex-wow player i'll give you a little comparison:  -Graphic wise ESO is better than WoW, especially compared to the old zones like Elwynn forest etc. -Quests are less boring in ESO because of nice voice acting and dialogue instead of just a small quest description. -ESO's combat is great fun, especially in first person. It's less complex than WoW's high-level combat because there are just 6 ability slots you can use instead of dozens. this isn't nescessarily a bad thing though, it makes it easier to learn your attacks and takes less space on your screen which adds to immersion.  I haven't played very long yet so I can't say much about the PVP or PVE side of the game. But I've heard wow's endgame PVE is better. One thing I dislike about ESO this far is the fact that you'll have to save for quite a few days to get a mount if you are not willing to buy one with real money, and also the lack of flying mounts ingame.   If you like wow, but wish it was a bit more immersive, simple, visually appealing or simply subscription free,  and/or if you are a fan of the elder scrolls' lore, this is your game. WoW certainly has things that are better than in ESO right now, like some anim./emotes, diversity in armor, garrisons &amp; raids.. (Do keep in mind that ESO is rather new compared to WoW, so i think it's kinda forgivable.)  I suggest you try both if you haven't already. Both are good, But hey, I prefer to keep my €13 each month.

            "review_text": "&lt;Rant&gt;  I am not going to lie I am not going to exaggerate This is the Greatest game I have ever played.  I have always loved MMORPGs. I have played WoW, archeage and a few others, whilst they all had good points  and bad points this game has EVERYTHING.   Pros:  Interesting NPCs, all fully voiced with FEELING. The voice actors don't feel bored  *cough* Peter the boring ghost out of destiny *cough*  Skill system makes leveling up more than just a *ding*- I have spent more time than I like to admit  just thinking over what  to put my next point into. *NOTE: be careful, once you put a point in, it costs a lot of gold to get it out apparently  The worlds HUGE!  Well duh Lewis its an elder scrolls game what did you think it would be? No voice in my head,  I mean more than that- skyrim, morrowind, daggerfall, they felt empty, this game has quests,  things to find, items to pick up, runes to collect (more on that later) and much, much more at every turn   This ones more hards to explain. You know that feeling when in Skyrim you heard the theme and you felt epic? When I'm riding down the road on my horse listening to the music, (for more on my horse see cons) that feeling  occurs, RIDING BETWEEN TOWNS FEELS EPIC a.k.a exactly what a game like this should do  Music is awesome and meaningful without breaking emersion  *Sigh* Its time for...  Cons:  £70 for the 'real' version??? I bought imperial addition because of two things: 'Horses are apparently super expensive' and well since theres only one dlc for the game I may as well. It is worth it, especially if you plan on playing with friends due to the 'scrolls of mara' which gives you a 10% exp bonus and has a hilarious animation that left me and my friend in stitches (SPOILER ALERT: sparkles come out your bum as you essentially marry them). Anyways back to my original point... There is nearly £30s MORE dlc in this game AFTER the imperial addition. I'll be honest I don't really mind that. I wouldn't mind if there was £50 more dlc that adds content into the game but instead the crown store (which is generally not to pay to win) allows you to buy the 'adventure's pack'. This pack allows you to be ANY RACE in ANY alliance. Forcing my friends to be either a Redguard, Orc or Brenton was horrible, my friend bought the game so he could play with me, his words: 'I can't wair to be a kajit like I was in skyrim', being the understanding fellow he is he picked Orc without a fuss-  RACE BOUND PAY WALLS SUCK!  Also optional subscription which gives you DLC for free, cosmetic items and 10% bonus to everything, theres literally a list of which includes EXP, research times, wiping your ♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ing your mum, etc, etc. Ok, I'll be honest this games way of keeping the game supported is actually the best system out there with possible the exception of Wow except this game has no sub! :D Not pay to win at all, mostly cosmetic with a few 'get there faster' style thing (e.g. pay £5 to do this, this or this or spend a few hours doing quests).  To sum up my first con, Money system GOOD not crap like certain other games that come to mind *cough* archeage *cough*  Graphics are ok on ultra if you can run it, one of the best for an MMO. Graphics good enough for things to look cool, not good enough for me to cry whilst looking directly at it.  Now this one bugs me the most: random frame drops after playing for a while.  PRO TIP: Use the 64 bit version of the game, in files it's called ESO64.exe more or less solved the problem however only use this method if your PC has more than 4GBs of RAM. I'm not gonna start explaining 32 bit vs 64 bit so google it :P   In Conclusion Or TL;DR: BUY THE GAME AND YOU WILL BECOME ADDICTED FASTER THAN YOU CAN FUS RO DAH... but only get it in the sales when its 50% off like it did ;)  Time to go play more ESO... &lt;/Rant&gt;",

Let's be honest: I'm sick of pretty much all games these days as they are not much more than several game elements from other games mashed together, and improved graphics. Some do this well such as Path of Exile. Others are more obvious about taking ideas from other successes, and mashing them together regardless of whether it actually fits. Elder Scrolls Online seems to repeat this ubiquitous gaming industry practice, but a slight improvement in terms of freeform gameplay.  As usual when starting a new game, I mindlessly went through the tutorial scene, and yet again popped up in 'who gives a crap' central mission hub with all the other new players. As is so familiar throughout the decades, I had zero skills and gear along with the jaded, 'oh look, let's kill mudcrabs for the next thirty minutes' attitude. Fun. But instead I just started killing NPCs. Whatever. Then I noticed something different.   In the decades past I would have been met by prompt judicial punishment. Countless guards would come swarming from all over. The NPCs themselves would be fighting back with a one shot that would invariably put me in my place. But not in ESO. No, strangely, no one came to the aid of the poor defenseless NPC that I had just murdered in plain sight. I tried it again, and this time a guard responded, but I ran away easily. A bounty was issued, and yet, no one cared. The guards were easy enough to avoid, so I just sneaked around them, and continued my assault. I didn't care, and the game didn't seem to stop me. What was this?! I felt more free in ESO than countless games before it. It was nice for a change.  Of course it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the guards, but they were easily evaded, and I actually started stalking NPCs for the fun of it. And I was actually getting levels for not following the 'goody two shoes' path laid out before me as has been the case for so many years. I was being rewarded for beating my own path. I accumulate a bounty, but no one has given a crap about it so far. I ignored other players; didn't want to grief actual people.   Now, I'm not going to comment on graphics or sound or anything since others have already done so, but I will say that this murderous 'honey badger' playstyle is not typically available in other games, as far as I know. The fact that it is possibly available in ESO means there is a unique place for players like me who have become so bored with traditional gameplay that something like this is a breath of fresh air. So, I recommend it.   If you, too, are gamer who is sick and tired of being hand-held to quest around as someone's personal errand boy, then maybe Elder Scrolls Online will sate your appetite until the next distraction comes around. Recommended (for now).  Edit: typos and spelling",

I was on the ban wagon of 'its had bad reviews im not bothering' but since the free weekend its been so enjoyable and i love it. The combat is awesome. The amount of customisation you can do to you class is crazy and the amount of content is great. I have played this game for about 29 hours now and still haven't left the first area after you leave your starting area. With latest update you can explore all of Tamriel and do quests in the other factions zones which is pretty cool. Just give it a try. Don't assume its a bad game because it was in bad shape on release. Oh btw there is no pay to win on this game which is a huge + for me. I hate pay to win games they're the worst. You can sub to ESO for minor buffs such as small exp bonuses to crafting and lvling but that's it. You're not missing out on anything if you don't sub.  So after playing a fair bit i'd like to update my review on what i think of the game now.  Pros:  -Massive content. I can't believe the amount of content in this game. It is crazy, i have put in 120ish hours into the game and i have only completed one zone. Mind you i do all side quests, guild quests etc. I don't plan on rushing story mode just yet but yes i have also been doing the story line bit by bit and so far the story line is great.  -Crafting. Crafting on this game is amazing. You can craft your own gear with your choice of traits, enchants etc. The best thing about it is that you can choose what style of weapons or gear you want to craft (As long as you have learned different crafting styles). Crafting does not feel like a grind unless you want to go grind out materials you can find throughout Tamriel.  -Questing Ok people can have different thoughts on this but for me i love the questing in this game. The best thing about the quests in ESO is that it feels like an Elder scrolls game. Most quests are unique. Unlike other mmos its not like EVERY quest is to go kill 20 Bandits and collect 10 pieces of cloth. Most of ESO quests gives you choices on what you want to do. For example save Jack or kill him which changes the outcome of the quest. I honestly wonder sometimes if i made the right choice which is awesome.  -Character Creation With every mmo you select a 'race' 'class' and 'faction' then you can change a few things like skin colour, hair styles etc. ESO however allows you to change every detail on your character making you feel more connected to the character. I think i spent a good hour on my first toon constantly changing his appearance. Just like the other Elder Scrolls games there is plenty of customisation options.  -Class Customisation. Whats that you want to be a mage that can wear heavy armour and duel wield? or do you prefer to use 2 handed weapons?. At first i was against this as i thought it would be stupid for a mage to duel wield or a night blade AKA assassin to use heavy armour but after playing around with the different weapons on classes its honestly amazing. You can go with your own personalised build and play around until you find something you really like. Unlike other mmo's prime example 'WoW' if you choose a class your locked into 1 set of weapon style you can use and everyone playing that class are using the same build. WoW is still a good game however unlike ESO you truly don't feel free to how you want to create your class. So if you want to be a mage and use a sword then the option is yours.  Cons:  -Laggy servers If your like me and live far away from the NA or EU servers you're going to suffer from a bit of lag . I have good internet speed with 90 down and 45 up and i get about 230 ping. It doesn't really bother me because i'm not doing PvP. I mean i'd love to do PvP but i'm afraid the little bit of lag will make it a bad experience for me  -Multiplayer Experience ESO definitely feels like more single player then multiplayer, WHICH is not really a bad thing. In fact some people might like that, i'm not really bothered by it as all the other Elder scrolls games are single player but if you truly want that group style of game play you're going to have to play with a friend. There is still group finder options and random dungeons ques etc but if your in a group and you like getting in to the quests you have to just click everything and ignore the dialogue other wise you get left behind unless the group your in also listens to the dialogue  -Editing your appearance Ok this is not really problem but i like to be able to edit my characters appearance. Unfortunately the only way to do that is to spend real money on the crown store to edit your characters appearance which is a bit poor because with an mmo you're going to spend a lot of time on one character and eventually you're going to want to either change your hairstyle, facial hair etc. I was happy with my characters appearance but regretted my hairstyle so i had to buy crowns just so i can change my hair style, i know that sounds dumb as you can just wear your head gear and you cant see your hair but i honesty prefer the 'hide helmet' option on. Now someone did tell me that sometime next year they're implementing a npc where you can change and edit your characters appearance whether that is true or not i hope this becomes a thing.  Overall i highly recommend this game if you're either into mmo's or the Elder Scrolls franchise as this game give you the feeling of both. This game has huge potential for the future so i'd love to see where the developers take this game. Thank you for reading if you made it this far and i hope i can make your decision easier to make. :)",

            "review_text": "People really need to give this game a chance. I was on the ban wagon of 'its had bad reviews im not bothering' but since the free weekend its been so enjoyable and i love it. The combat is awesome. The amount of customisation you can do to you class is crazy and the amount of content is great. I have played this game for about 29 hours now and still haven't left the first area after you leave your starting area. With latest update you can explore all of Tamriel and do quests in the other factions zones which is pretty cool. Just give it a try. Don't assume its a bad game because it was in bad shape on release. Oh btw there is no pay to win on this game which is a huge + for me. I hate pay to win games they're the worst. You can sub to ESO for minor buffs such as small exp bonuses to crafting and lvling but that's it. You're not missing out on anything if you don't sub.  So after playing a fair bit i'd like to update my review on what i think of the game now.  Pros:  -Massive content. I can't believe the amount of content in this game. It is crazy, i have put in 120ish hours into the game and i have only completed one zone. Mind you i do all side quests, guild quests etc. I don't plan on rushing story mode just yet but yes i have also been doing the story line bit by bit and so far the story line is great.  -Crafting. Crafting on this game is amazing. You can craft your own gear with your choice of traits, enchants etc. The best thing about it is that you can choose what style of weapons or gear you want to craft (As long as you have learned different crafting styles). Crafting does not feel like a grind unless you want to go grind out materials you can find throughout Tamriel.  -Questing Ok people can have different thoughts on this but for me i love the questing in this game. The best thing about the quests in ESO is that it feels like an Elder scrolls game. Most quests are unique. Unlike other mmos its not like EVERY quest is to go kill 20 Bandits and collect 10 pieces of cloth. Most of ESO quests gives you choices on what you want to do.

I will say this game has opened me up. It scales nicely to the level you are at, and the playing style you choose. Plus, there are always other people in game that are always willing to help. I can be working on one quest, another player is at the same point, we group together and complete it. One recommendation I would make is to join an established guild. Not one of the guilds that requires you to spend your in-game resources to be a member, I think that is ridiculous. I am part of a couple of guilds that cost me nothing, and they are successful guilds. These guilds are key, I have found, to being successful. They also make the game more enjoyable and you can get a lot of great advice from those that are more experienced. So I would say the community is excellent. As far as graphics are concerned, ramp yours up to whatever your machine can handle. I have mine set to ultra with no problems and the game is beautiful, runs smooth. I recommend turning the grass off, it's not needed. As far as the internet connection, I live in an area where we have caps on our internet. Downloading ate up a lot during the monthly cycle, after that, it barely scratches it. So from someone that has always dispised online gaming, this game rocks, and I definitely recommend it. If you played Oblivion and Skyrim and you loved them, you will love this.",

I would like to point out that all of this gameplay time has been spent on one character; ONE!  My wife, she has 765 hours of gameplay right now, also on ONE character of hers. We don't even play alts - nope, we play our main characters, every time we get on here; we've sunken all of this gameplay time into a total of two characters: her main and my main... and we STILL have not done everything there is to do.  The DLC's that they have released for ESO are huge, with new crafting motifs, recipies, etc. to learn, as well as different forms of PvP, PLENTY of dugneons, pets, you name it.  The fact that you don't have to pay per month is extraordinary! The in-game cash store is NOT P2W in the slightest! In fact, you can earn a majority of the things that are featured in the cash store by simply playing the game; the things which you cannot earn from playing the game are aesthetic only: pretty much costumes and special pets.  I will admit, on initial release ESO was a let down. As a title to follow Skyrim, this game had a lot to live up to, especially for something which is online.  You have to understand, from a programming and game design perspective, Online and Offline (singleplayer) games are made differently. Single Player games often have more features than online ones do, mostly because of the constant battle with Polygons which artists must face, and the other constant battle of Server-Client issues which programmers contest through development.  In order to make an online game EXACTLY like Skyrim, it wouldn't be impossibe, but it would be heavily demanding on the users computers, etc.  I go off track though...  This is no longer anything, in my opinion, like it was on its initial release. This is as close to Skyrim as an MMO could possibly get with balanced gameplay for all, in my opinion, and I love it. Slowly, one piece at a time, they will have the entirity of Tamriel completed and you'll be able to walk the island of Morrowind, and so on...  If you are an original player from the initial release, come back and give it a try now that SO much has changed.  If you like your Elder Scrolls titles and you have been hesitant to try this because of what you may have heard, IGNORE THE ILL REVIEWS and give it a try for yourself.  What do you have to lose? There's no monthly subscription. If you don't like it, add it to the pile of your other steam games which you've purchased and played only once.  I promise you though - You'll become addicted.",

Now that the game can be played without a subscription if you have a copy of the unlimited version there was no longer a reason not to pick up this game.  I would highly reccommend this game to anyone who enjoy games with Open World, RPG, MMO, Story Rich and Sandbox as Tags. My two favourite features about this game are the tutorial system for the game, if you have completed the tutorial once than you are offered to skip it on a second character while gaining the standard level of 3 that you would get from completing it normaly. Very helpful for people like me who play as 15-20 characters for the first few days to learn more about the classes and skills before deciding on what I want my main character to be. My second feature that I enjoy about this game is the hot swap weapons that you are able to set up at level 15 this counters the limit of only having 5 skills and an ultimate skill set up.  My cons for this game are not having enough time to play and the delete system although I wouldnt change how it works since I do think it is a great idea and solves a lot of normal bot problems. It is troublesome for my method of haveing 15-20 characters to decide on what class I want to be.  Overall Best MMO I have played yet and favourite Elder Scrolls game.",

Archery in this game seems like a downgrade from skyrim  howver the combat system has largely inproved there is now darcksoles rolle machanic and a much better block/parry system.  i would definately recomend everyone try this game out i also would rate it a 'Verrygood' out of 10",

While this was the case for me, this was more of a coincidence because Elder Scrolls: Online is an MMO and it acts like it, too. Skyrim was like a tweaked Oblivion while this game is like World of Warcraft with some plastic surgery to jam some Elder Scrolls lore in there.  Many complain about the download size but it has zones from The Summerset Isles to Windhelm and from Cyrodiil to Hammerfell. The game is packed with content and has quests around every corner. The download size is about 80 GB so plan accordingly.  I own the imperial edition which as far as i can tell grants 4 things of any form of value:  1. You can access the imperial race and if you choose this race, you can choose any alliance.  2. You have access to the 'Imperial Horse' which can be used no matter what race you choose  3. You can access the imperial crafting style (you get to look cool)  4. YOU CAN HAVE A MUDCRAB AS A PET  Unfortunately this game has microtransactions but most of which are cosmetic with the exception of mounts and DLC. From what I've found, DLC is only purchasable through the in-game premium currency called crowns. Without this knowledge at my original purchase I didn't get around to buying any DLC so i cannot give my perspective on whether or not those are worth the time or money.",

I've been an avid elder scrolls fan since Morrowind for Xbox, and was excited to hear about this release. Some friends play the beta and didn't recommend it. But it went on sale for Christmas last year and I had enough funds in my steam wallet so I said why not?! So glad I did! It's not really what I expected from an MMO (which was mostly negative before) and it's not quite the same as most of the other elder scrolls games preceding it (although a fresh approach was definitely nice!) you know the layout I'm talking about: run around, help rando's find their lost kitty, help other rando's assassinate their cheating spouse, accomplish side quests for factions that may or may not be more fun than the main quest which you never know if it will end up being very underwhelming and/or tedious, but at least feeling like the money spent on the game had been worth it... TESO has definitely been all those things and , I feel, totally worth it. It has all those elements quintessentially elder scrolls with that odd [to me] MMO gameplay style that lends something fresh to the elder scrolls experience. Sometimes other players can be of noxious and even downright rude, but my experience has been that the overwhelming majority of them are helpful or just leave you alone to do your thing in Tamriel, and there are countless guilds to join up with, meet new friends who love the elder scrolls series as much as you do, or or for you to teach them how! I definitely recommend this amalgamation of MMO and elder scrolls to anyone looking to experience the series for the first time and for seasoned older scrolls fans alike. I won't pretend it's perfect, and there are plenty of things I wish it had that it doesn't, but at the end of the day this exists for entertainment and when I'm asked if I am not entertained, I must say I absolutely am, every time I log on!",

Archery in this game seems like a downgrade from skyrim  howver the combat system has largely inproved there is now darcksoles rolle machanic and a much better block/parry system.  i would definately recomend everyone try this game out i also would rate it a 'Verrygood' out of 10",

The good   Faithful to the Elder Scrolls canon (well, it had to be, didn't it? ;) ) Decent race and class customisation Huge world to explore, especially with the advent of One Tamriel Game has a large population. There's always plenty of people on Largely avoids the kill 10 rats quest paradigm of a lot of other MMOs. Quests actually show a bit of thought and design. There is a bit of step and fetch it involved however Shared bank space so all your characters on the account can use stuff If you sub to the game, you get a craft bag, an unlimited bank for all crafting materials. Awesome IMHO Excellent combat and spell effects Character modelling, clothing, armour, etc, is excellent You can dye your armour and clothes Some wicked sense of humour on display with a few NPCs Awesome sense of progression, both in class levelling and crafting Elder Scrolls amorality - kill and rob to your heart's content - though you do need DLC to do this properly Game is in active development - new content gets added fairly often, and not just cash shop fluff either Very challenging boss fights, solo missions, dungeons, etc. By no means a faceroll Game is a lot of fun when you have good people to play it with Quick game to log in to M'aiq the Liar, sweet rolls, mudcrabs and fishy sticks   The bad   Imperial race behind a paywall Game is a strict themepark, arguably little replayabililty once you've done it all Game is heading towards pay to win IMHO. It's not there and might not get there, but there are a few ominous signs in the air. The introduction of Crown Crates has put this game into Neverwinter territory a bit World graphics aren't particularly crisp or bright. Lots of washed out greys and browns.

The 'story mode' to this game is pretty cool but very predictable. There is so much to do in this game and I look foward to playing this game in the future. All in all with everything in consideration for this game my scores are:   Personal Score: 9/10  General Score Non-Bias: 7/10  If you enjoy MMO's like WoW and BDO I suggest this game to those kind of people but if you are looking to start playing an MMO i do not suggest this game.

Lots of things have improved when it comes to freedom and gameplay and it doesnt play like those other typical MMORPG games out there. It offers so much freedom on how you play your character and how you explore the world. Also its a lot more forgiving too since the world will adjust for you, not the other way around comapred to most MMORPGs out there.   If you were reluctant to get it before since this game came out crap. Now is the right time to change your mind and give this game another chance.

That being said, I have played quite a few MMORPG's and know a good one when I see one. This is what I have been looking for lately in a game. To take me away and fully delve me into a game with incredible graphics, story, and gameplay! The fact that I'm somewhat familiar with Elder Scrolls lore is just a bonus. To me, the cut-scene questing is pretty top notch in both visuals and voice acting. Even lip movement is sync'd fairly well. Interface is clean and intuitive. Map is detailed and expandable. Love the Quickslot option, and the way skill trees are unlocked based on the spells you use most in combat.   I only recently started, but for those people that have played the game in it's early days (or even just before this recent patch), perhaps this video will help clarify some of the things they've changed/improved.

It's a good change, although I do wish sometimes they had a battleground aspect of pvp to the game, because there are a few issues with an open world pvp system. Such as fps drops,lag, getting smoked by a group of 24(a zerg). But overall if you are looking for a new mmorpg pvp experience give it a go. Also although not required the subscription of $15 a month is almost a nessessity due to the lack of bag space for crafting mats without it. So you either sub or play bag space manager 2016. At some points this game will leave you in a state of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic bliss, and at others a state of rage, hate and frustration. Which is alright if you're into crying while self pleasuring.

Probably not except for the way they designed how certain abilities level up and how vocal npcs are when you speak with them. I appreciate the game so much just because how beautifully done everything is. You can tell they took their time in creating areas and how the npc's are voiced. The game is visually stunning. For people who expected this to be like other elder scroll games be real! You can't have a singleplayer game become a massive online game. A lot of the elements in the elder scrolls series are in this game but you cannot expect single player mechanics to be brought into a multiplayer game. It just does not work like that.   Pros -  Combat + counterplay for certain abilities Graphics Beautiful environments Npcs are diverse / enemies are diverse. Sounds are pleasing / npcs are voiced beautifully. First person / third person mode. Character customization. Crafting.  Cons - Quests are time consuming go from X to Y. (every mmo has this...) Quests are sometimes rather silly more so than serious. (every mmo has this) There is a lot of emphasis on gathering materials, so you spend a majority of your time searching for these items. Game is not noob friendly. Cost of game + monthly subscription. *pricey* (given the detail and amount of effort put into it I see why)   Pro / Con - Mega servers allow areas to be unpopulated. (mostly instances, certain quests); however, I noticed in town there isn't as many people as I'd expect. A lot of good names are still open! (really? How? Perhaps this game needs more player base)  Personal opinion on this game on a scale of 1/10? I'd give it a 9/10. Am I biased? I'd like to think not. I may not be as far in the game as many people as I recently picked it up but typically you get the feel of an MMO quite early on how it's going to be in it's entirity. I recommend picking it up on sale and playing but I would not justify paying 60-80$ on top of the 15 $ fee regardless of how nice the servers are or the quality of the game. That really hurts them in the long run. Eventually I'd expect them to lower it and or cave in to allowing people try the game for X amount of time or until X amount of levels in order to increase the player base. I will be playing this game for time to come and see where it goes... Either way I really enjoy it! Seriously give it a shot but don't expect it to be skyrim, oblivion! ",

It's got hundreds of hourse of gameplay, and it's set in my favourite fantasy realm. Although it's not quite the same as playing one of the single player Elder Scrolls games, it's still the best MMO I've ever played. And the first one I've played that doesn't feel like a WoW clone.  Although, it isn't without a few drawbacks. The most notible of which being that the fully voiced characters are a bit of a hit and miss. Some of them are actually really good, but others are entirely unfit castings, and some of them make me wonder how on Nirn these people thought it would be a good idea to pursue a career as a profesional voice actor at all, or how anyone in their right mind thought it was a good idea to cast such people as hundreds of NPCs to be heard by millions.  Another drawback is that combat is more about your character's power and stats, and less about your skill as a player.  Still it's a delightful game, and if you want to try to get into an MMO, this is the one.",

Graphics- they look very good actually,and i was very surprised to see that the game is very good optimised.This runs better on ultra than skyrim does,and not to mention there are tons of players and i never drop below 30fps in highly populated areas.(and i dont have such a great gaming pc,so this is a big plus for the game)  Sound- Its gorgeous.I love it,they definetely did a very good job with the sound.  Story- its pretty big,and i find it interesting.  The quests- you have plenty of them,some of them may repeat but 'ay,happens.  Races/classes- The detail of the races is pretty gud,and you have 4 classes to choose from,each of them have different skill trees.The thing that i love the most about these classes and races is that you are FREE to do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want with ur character.Nobody stops u from being a orc sorcerer based on stamina(this is really ♥♥♥♥ed up actually lmfao),u can do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want,and thats brilliant.  PVE-This game is definetely based on pve,it may get a little boring later in the game but still,u got lots of areas with lots of different enemies,dungeons,bosses.  PVP- Now this ♥♥♥♥ is getting intense,if you didnt know u can actually have battles between the 3 alliances and you can smash the walls from their castles and ♥♥♥♥ and this is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing great.As for the 1v1 pvp,it sucks for me but i guess im just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beginner and i lose versus other players that are definetely better,ehm happens m8..  The map is ♥♥♥♥ing gigantic ,i bet you will spend all ur life trying to discover every ♥♥♥♥  The community - so far,ive never saw a single toxic kid on the chat which is very good,they all talk to each other,give advices to each other,so you can definetely say its a much better community than the League of legends com. :steamsalty: lmao  Crown shop- * THERE IS NO P2W * ,you can buy mounts,DLCs,and lots of stuff with crowns (you get 500 crowns when u start the game,and if you want to buy more crowns, ull have to buy them with real money,seems legit m8)And the DLCs are actually pretty cool,i mean u have dlcs like Imperials ♥♥♥♥ where u can play as a imperial and u have lots of other areas on the map to explore,so im sure u wont get bored,now,that depens on you.  So far the game is great,im going to buy it ,i mean its $10 dude.And i recommend it especially if ure a Elder Scrolls fan,but its better if u grab it on sale because its worth it.  overall 8.50/10 noice gaem m8.  wait a ♥♥♥♥ing second  8.50= 4+4 + 0.069 4(20blazeit)= 3+1 3= 1+1+1 1+1+1=3 LOOMINATY CONFURMED.",

Too expensive, even though they open up new areas and quests.  What is it like to play? So far, pretty simplistic. No real challenges that a single player (my preferred play style) cannot overcome. Quest-driven story: not gather 50 of these...Segregated PvP, in a special area (Yay!). I hate high level chs thumping junior players just because they can (13-year olds?. Nice scenery for this class of game. Extensive crafting and enchanting options, none of which I have played yet (they seem far more complex than in Skyrim- a game in which I have invested more than 1000 hrs...)  Neverwinter is better at drawing you in and giving a high-action thrill, but less impressive quests.  On balance? Snap it up for the basic six or seven quid.  ",

SOO many times we tried to play the game but the lag man.. it was so bad the game could not be played at all and we had to log out and play something else. even when you log out and in again, the lag continues and the rage begins.

I love it's interactive combat system versus using abilities only and just watching. Hell it even has abilities to give the combat a nice twist! It's a huge game and brings great fun and adventure.   If you're looking for a Skyrim clone, however; you will be a little disappointed. It's not as polished, but enough to give a very unique experience.  I've heard at launch it was an absolute joke and I waited until years later. Now it's a lot better than its launch.   A nice addition to the game is the option to either go with or without the subscription. But the downside to that is you won't have access to the expansions unless you pay for them individually (and that's gonna be pricey.) So ultimately it's up to you on which is the lesser of the two evils. There are some micro-transactions, but mostly cosmetic and a small handful of boosts. You subscribe and you get some crowns per month and access to all the expansions and an exp bonus. The pricing is the same as World of Warcraft ($14.99 USD per month), but I think it's worth it in my honest opinion.  Overall, this game is a very fun and unique experience. It's a nice tribute to the fans as well; especially the ones who wanted this to be taken to the online world. I highly recommend this game, but I also suggest waiting for a sale on it so you can save some cash... for the membership!",

According to a comment It was fixed but I'd still play it safe and download it manually.  Other than I say this is a pretty solid MMORPG if I've ever played one. Graphics are decent. Grind can be fun with friends and it's not too boring solo. I've haven't seen much pay2win elements.

So I might not be the best source when it comes to deciding whether or not this is worth playing in that regard specifically. However, I will say that I have enjoyed playing this game a lot. The PvE content in this game, between the solo campaign, and the various group dungeons, will keep you busy for hundreads, if not thousands of hours, easily. All the while progressing your character by unlocking new skills, training your crafting skills, finding cool and rare loot, and grinding out drop tables and exp farms.

As always, I wanted to make a character that is kind of an a-hole, but ends up doing good in his own twisted ways. Basically, make a real character, as you are supposed to in an RPG-ish game. Now, this is definitely NOT that game. You are either a melee fighter or a wizard, there is no other way really. Because you just can't do that, as there will always be some random player who will rush into the room and start a swordfight with your target. Also hella annoying to have all the random folks wreaking havoc in the cities. Also it is kinda annoying to see the main target of your quest respawn every minute. When you are going about looting and readig books but he starts hitting you over and over again because he is never really killed. Basically, nothing really happens in the game, ever. It is like being in limbo. Title could be like: Elder Scrolls Online: Purgatory Unlimited. But I will keep playing anyway, to sate my hunger for a new Elder Scrolls adventure. Even if I feel like I am never really having an adventure. I would definitely recommend it as a single-player game, or as a substitute until a new real Elder Scrolls game comes out.",

Graphics- they look very good actually,and i was very surprised to see that the game is very good optimised.This runs better on ultra than skyrim does,and not to mention there are tons of players and i never drop below 30fps in highly populated areas.(and i dont have such a great gaming pc,so this is a big plus for the game)  Sound- Its gorgeous.I love it,they definetely did a very good job with the sound.  Story- its pretty big,and i find it interesting.  The quests- you have plenty of them,some of them may repeat but 'ay,happens.  Races/classes- The detail of the races is pretty gud,and you have 4 classes to choose from,each of them have different skill trees.The thing that i love the most about these classes and races is that you are FREE to do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want with ur character.Nobody stops u from being a orc sorcerer based on stamina(this is really ♥♥♥♥ed up actually lmfao),u can do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want,and thats brilliant.  PVE-This game is definetely based on pve,it may get a little boring later in the game but still,u got lots of areas with lots of different enemies,dungeons,bosses.  PVP- Now this ♥♥♥♥ is getting intense,if you didnt know u can actually have battles between the 3 alliances and you can smash the walls from their castles and ♥♥♥♥ and this is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing great.As for the 1v1 pvp,it sucks for me but i guess im just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beginner and i lose versus other players that are definetely better,ehm happens m8..  The map is ♥♥♥♥ing gigantic ,i bet you will spend all ur life trying to discover every ♥♥♥♥  The community - so far,ive never saw a single toxic kid on the chat which is very good,they all talk to each other,give advices to each other,so you can definetely say its a much better community than the League of legends com. :steamsalty: lmao  Crown shop- * THERE IS NO P2W * ,you can buy mounts,DLCs,and lots of stuff with crowns (you get 500 crowns when u start the game,and if you want to buy more crowns, ull have to buy them with real money,seems legit m8)And the DLCs are actually pretty cool,i mean u have dlcs like Imperials ♥♥♥♥ where u can play as a imperial and u have lots of other areas on the map to explore,so im sure u wont get bored,now,that depens on you.  So far the game is great,im going to buy it ,i mean its $10 dude.And i recommend it especially if ure a Elder Scrolls fan,but its better if u grab it on sale because its worth it.  overall 8.50/10 noice gaem m8.  wait a ♥♥♥♥ing second  8.50= 4+4 + 0.069 4(20blazeit)= 3+1 3= 1+1+1 1+1+1=3 LOOMINATY CONFURMED.",

I do understand the reviews about the game being buggy to set up and such though.   Anyway, the game is pretty fun if you are into MMOs and Elder Scrolls.

            "review_text": "As a huge fan of Bethesda's, Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, I waited off buying Elder Scrolls Online as I read it was a completely different experience from the single player games I was used to (also thee subscription was also a big no-no).  As games like Skyrim are so well know, I will try to compare this to that, as a lot of people like myself might be confused at how this game will play when compared to it. I have never played many MMO's except for Runescape when I was younger, and so I cannot say whether this is better for you than other MMO's.  The feel of the game is very much the same as the rest of the Elder Scrolls games, and the world is exactly what I would have wanted as you can now explore many different parts of Tamreil than before, seeing the home of the different races, and therefore getting more backstory and feel for the differences between races.  I feel the biggest difference this game had from Skyrim was the combat system, which in skyrim was very 1v1 and had a more difficult feel when groups of enemies appear. Its almost as if the scale of the combat has been changed, as now you can fight hoards of enemies and much more interesting 'bosses'. This I suppose is more like what MMO's usually do, but the skyrim combat allowed for more interesting tactics like stealth, whereas ESO has less of that.  Another big change is the crafting system, which in ESO has a huge assortment of different options. For weapons and armour you now chose the material, quantity of material, style and trait. This allows for many more combinations of weapons and armour, but is a steep learning curve go through until you fully understand what you are doing. But this allows you to make armour in any material which is styled to your race (or any other race if you'd prefer). I remember in Skyrim and Oblivion, making dwarvern or elven armour which looked good, but looked aweful on some races and roles, whereas this new crafting system allows you to make a bigger variety of styles to suit your needs.  As well as weapon and armour crafting you also have provisioning for food (which is actually useful for once) which gives you 30 minute boosts in health, magic or stamina. There are literally hundreds of ingredients which you can use in hundreds of recipes, and for a while you struggle to find the right ingredients, and fill your inventory with useless ones. Gradually as you find or buy more recipes you will get this under control and will reduce the amount of crap you feel you have to carry; around as someday, 200 berries might be useful!  The alchemy is very much the same, however uses an additional item to decide on whether you make a potion or poison, and what level they will be.  The enchanting is a bit weird, and seemingly complicated as you have to chose three runestones for each enchanting glyph which you then add to weapon/armour/jewelry. These three runes decided on first the level and strength of the enchantment, the effect of the enchantment, and then the quality. So you will end up being confused by the weirdly named runestones, but once you use them it tells you what they do and you will have enchanting figured out.  The multiplayer aspect of the game is a weird one, at some points quests say they are solo only, and some are just quests you and friends can decide to do at the same time, however some require a group of 4 to play, as the dungeon areas will be leveled to a group of 4, so on your own you might struggle a little (a lot). Luckily there is also a feature to do these dungeons with randomers in a group finder, so you can still play ESO completely even if you are the only person you know who has the game.  The subscription (ESO+); which I don't and have never had, seems to only add in features to make things a little easier. You will get a small boost in xp and gold gained, and will get some other handy features like an unlimited crafting bag, so you can carry around hundreds of berries without worrying about a full inventory. The main benefit is being able to play all the DLC whilst you have ESO+ and also you get some crowns every month which you can spend on purchasing anything you want, either the DLC you want to have forever, or and other things like pets, mounts, apparels.  It is worth me saying that I dont feel I NEED to get the subscription to enjoy the game, I rarely ever consider it, other than when I fill my inventory (which happens regularly), as there is so much in the game that the extra quest lines aren't needed for a veeerry long time.  In summary, the combat is on a bigger scale, the world is gigantic and gorgeous, the quests are what you are used to in Skyrim, and the crafting is complicated, but allows a huge amount of possibilities if you want that. I definitely recommend the game to anyone who loves and other Elder Scrolls game, as long as you are not looking for a sequel, as this is definitely NOT the same as Skyrim, but takes Skyrim, and blows it up into an MMO, which adds in a bunch of good things, but also takes away a lot of the simplicities. The only complaints I have are the sometimes very unreliable framerates, and the annoyingly easy to fill inventory, but these are minor problems in an overall great game.",

Great combat. Great talent/skill system. Excellent quests. Great voice acting. Overall it's a very pretty game.  Negative Aspects:  Despite it being a rather attractive game, the actual animations for character models are pretty terrible and clunky. No real auction-house, just guild merchant crap. Player interaction is bare-minimal. (It's a MMO, that you play as if it were a single player game. Without mods. Argh.) The GUI is fairly atrocious, even if it is nicely minimalistic. Camera &amp; mouse controls are a bit wonky because they had to design around sub-human console peasants. The engine runs barely 'ok' on great hardware. It's not Skyrim Co-Op or Skyrim Online. I loathe crafting and everything related to it.  All in all, I'd rather have had Skyrim-Online or another expansion or some such, regardless, this is a good game and I enjoy what I do here. The main storyline(s), quests, skill system and combat are exceptional. Yes, I consider it worth the price and will probably put several hundred hours+ into it before I get bored.

Dungeon format, armour styles and  plenty of lore to enjoy.   +/-  The  Gameplay  is not very rewarding. You get the feeling of progress constantly and there is pretty much no level cap. That's great! But it isn't often that I felt accomplished about something. There's few skills that are satisfying to use and the animations are all a bit... dull. The sounds don't give the oomph effect in combat and there's not often an area that's neat looking to enjoy.

Sometimes it's really hard to complete certain things because some monster has to spawn, or you run through a dungeon without any monsters again. This is a bad thing on the overworld to me, but such a populated game has its benefits. This game doesn't have the thing every MMORPG struggles with. You could be on the most deserted looking out of place dungeon, and you still run into a handful of people.   +/-  To me, the  music isn't very memorable.  After 450 hours I can point out some places I like the music in. Such as the dark-anchor/Dolmen combat musics. It's one of the nicer songs but I can't remember how it goes at all. It's not bad music in this game at all! It just doesn't feel very interesting and thus isn't very memorable.   -  Half a day maintenance, and pretty often server problems at all, server lag and whatever  server clumsiness  is going on.   -  There's some '' Elder Scrolls features '' about.

But if still FEELS like an elder scrolls game.  I've been playing this game entireley in first person view, and it is phenomenal. I've grouped with other players, talked with people in the chat. The player base seems fantastic so far and the cooperative experience was fantastic as well. The lore is intense in this game compared to the others. They constantly throw lore at you and it makes for a very immersive experience.  Staffs also, they are awesome. I thought I was going to use a bow in this game until I picked up and used my first staff. And I just about reopened the wound I just had surgery on when I saw someone summon a storm atronach (It was ♥♥♥♥ing glorious).  Overall, the game is worth 60 bucks. I would not pay a subscription monthly to play it, but it is without a doubt worth its full price. ESPECIALLY, if you've got friends you want to play in within the elder scrolls realm. That's what it's all about after all, otherwise it would've been another singleplayer game.",

I was excited for the game and pre ordered it and got early access. I did have a beta invite but I decide since I wanted it to be a surprise for me when it came out. No spoilers and etc. I knew as a MMO you couldn’t mod the game (Except the UI) since its almost impossible to make mods and play them in a MMO so I knew theres no modding this game so I won’t need to spend time planning my mods just enjoying the game! The difference with this game compared to many Elder Scrolls games I played before is the MMO interface such as Skill Attacks, Banking, Guild Stores, etc. I like many of these features but I am not the biggest fan of the Skill Attacks but I grew into them. And the world isn’t one big worldspace and its not ALL of Tamriel but its large worldspaces that you play though and once your reach a certain level you can advance into a new worldspace. And the game is expanding with new location that are DLC. I don’t mind the worldspaces and their huge and to have one worldspace would be insane to run on a server and with the Tamriel One update your allowed to go anywhere in Tamriel and not worry about being a certain level when in certain regions which is the best update this game ever had! Nevertheless there are hundreds of quests and even now in 2015 I still haven’t beat the game since it’s a long storyline. This game will keep you busy for hours with tons of things to do such as steal, kill, crafting, trading with other players, selling your custom items to other players, quests, fighting the war in Cyrodiil with your alliance against other players, grouping up with other players and completing quests, etc. It’s a fun game with endless opportunities like any Elder Scrolls game and I recommend it to anyone who like MMOs and Elder Scroll games.",

This Elder Scrolls game falls right in line with the quality of gameplay, lore and graphics as with the older titles. Veterans of this series will be taken down Nostalgia Lane with some of the locations, sounds and music. The MMO aspect is there and it is really awesome to finally see other Heroes in the wilderness and fight monsters together. They really did that aspect well, because you dont have to be grouped to receive loot chance drop and experience. You can also group together, and here is where the main beef of the game really bothers me, since I've been spoiled by other successful MMOs. The group mechanics, in particularly the Tank role, hardly ever holds aggro from pulls (even trash pulls) therefore making the group constantly having to duck and dodge getting hit for simply attacking the monster. This is simply unacceptable in my opinion and should be seriously considered a future patch update to add aggro to the tank's skills. Another problem I have is the constricting number of skills you can have set at a time. You can have countless spells/abilities but you can only bind 5 on your hotbar to use during an encounter. The game is overall enjoyable and I will continue to play even if it will take some getting used to. Seasoned MMO players may experience the same drawbacks as well. The game doesn't require a sub to play but if you do sub you do get quite a bit of perks for doing so. If your interested in purchasing, go to the website to see the difference in no sub/sub.  Pros: -Rich Storyline -Beautiful Graphics -Great Sound -Massive World -Class Customization  Cons: -Tank mechanic issues while grouping -Zone channel trolls -not really recommended to players who are new to MMOs -Hotbar for Skill/Spell limitations ",

The main questline seemed to fade away after the tutorial but it seems like a good one featuring the deadra lord molag bal, you start off as a stranger with no memory of anything previously and something abour a prophecy  (blah blah standard elder scrolls storytelling) after you leave the tutorial area it takes you to an island and starts a  questline with a lovely captain who recued your sorry ♥♥♥ from drowning, apparently you were out cold for some weeks I was in a rush to get started and made a fatal error of completely skipping this area of the game, will plan to head back sometimethe side quests are alot of the standard go over here kill things fetch this etc but the characters involved are interesting, the areas are also beautiful so your so distracted you dont realise how cookie cutter it all can be. The combat system to me seems alot similar to dragon age origins wasd to move with 1-9 being your spell bar left right mouse buttons to attack and block all easy to get to grips with. However fighting is very easy if it were an offline elder scrolls game I imagine the difficulty would be very easy most vanilla mobs die to three standard attacks and bosses only take a few more whilest being easy to dance around whilest taking 0 damage, I hope this is just because im not past level 10 and the game is trying to be freindlier especially to people who havent experianced this style of combat before.

The quests are actually pretty immersive, and the storytelling is great. it plays very much like skyrim, but as if its been taken to another level (in a good way of course.) The voices are done how they should be for any elder scrolls game, and for an mmorpg game, i think it fits in with the rest of the elder scrolls franchise pretty well.  15/10  p.s: just remember that its an mmorpg, it is NOT skyrim online.  Pros:   -Pretty easy to get used to -graphics are amazing -feels like skyrim, but better -story is great -Feels like a elder scrolls game, and not just another mmorpg -very interactive like an elder scrolls game should be  Cons:  -a little complicated to manage guilds at first -you have to get used to sharing with others -doesnt have 'that I am me' feel very much. makes you kinda feel like one in the crowd when you are in a dramatic quest or situation with other people doing the same as you. (but that like all other mmorpg games.)  Overall the game is awesome, and prbably one of the most addictive games ive ever played. this is a must have for Elder scrolls fans.",

You can solo through almost any quests. Game feels great, fantastic music, EXTREMELY immersive and addicting for any Elder Scrolls fan who is into the lore. This is the first MMO I have played that I feel like I have my own individuality from the players around me. It feels like a single player game inside an MMO which I love. Quests are intuitive for the most part and every area has a main storyline as well as a main storyline for your characters personal journey which keeps you intereseted. It also has it's typical go here hunt some beasts, save these people, collect ingredients and return quests as well. But those quests are usually worth doing sometimes because they usually give you decent items that are often worth equipping for whatever class they support. Oh, and 99% of NPC's are voice acted. Bravo.    They fixed this game and it is fantastic and I hope it wasn't too late for ESO because these game is great right now and has a healthy player population.

Combat works. I was surprised.   Thus far I only have one great disappointment. The classes are not what I expected, especially supposing to be a elder scrolls game. I expected more options and freedom. Though, there is a sort of freedom. For example each class has skill lines you can follow. For example the templar can heal, do melee attacks, or magical attacks. That's pretty cool. You can even mix up your skills. I DO like that you can wear pretty much any armor and use any weapon you want. You just have to train it.  I do want to say though, the UI and the program itself is smooth and easy! Everything is just simple and good. It loads good. I can even alt tab. I'm doing it now, lol. This game is reminescent of the older elder scroll games and I am liking it! Nostalgia. And it's online so you can play with your friends.  You'll notice i'm speaking positively of it.

The game is fully voice acted with interesting quest lines taking you through all of tamriel. However, you can only visit half of tamriel and i hope they add new zones in the future. This game also has a stealth system and a justice system but the guards are very hard to kill. You can also steal items from markets without paying and selling or laundering them in the outlaws refuge which is a way to make easy money.  The combat system is amazing with 5 different abilities in each set and you can have 2 sets of abilities that is easy to switch between. Each class has different abilities and skills that can be unlocked along with racial skills, weapon skills, etc. There is so much customization avaliable.  The graphics are nice for an mmo with a more realistic look to it. The architecture is very well done with large cities. However, the villages can sometimes be made uup of only 3 buildings.  Boss battles and areas are very difficult and is a good idea to team up with friends or other people. Players are always willing to help and fight the boss thanks to the kind community (there are not many good communities out there in gaming).",

At first i was waiting for The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™ to be on Discount, but then i decided to buy it on the fullprice, because the game is really worth of every cent! My opinion is that The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™ stays loyal to the Elder Scrolls lore. I was bit worried, that does Bethesda change things too much for it to become an MMORPG.  I have always wanted to play an MMORPG:s, but i haven´t yet found one that i would enjoy after multiple hours. But The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™ is a game just like that. I will propably play this for thousands of hours, and still enjoy it. Hopefully i don´t use all of my money to buy Crowns, and other stuff...  I will definetly upgrade my ESO account when i have more time to play.  I will also update this review when i have more time, and when i have played more.

ESO is actually designed to be fun.  There are no kill and fetch quests - every quest has story elements that are actually well thought out and not totally pointless. Your decisions change the actual playable world and towns you go to, which is unprecendented in a multiplayer rpg  They did not skimp on writing and story, as other MMOs do.  They did not skimp on voice acting  They did not take shortcuts with gameplay and combat. Gameplay is satisfying and fulfilling. Even when you want to grind, it doesnt feel like you are.  This does not play like an MMO. it plays like and RPG, buit it's still multiplayer with all the good elements of multiplayer. It's a truly excellent production.

After this, ♥♥♥♥ing launcher downloaded also 40gb of game. And finally - launcher did a ♥♥♥♥ing unpacking!!!!111!!!ONE. After this all ♥♥♥♥ing and idiotic acts, I started playing. Not so ♥♥♥♥ing game requested to write a code in an e-mail. I waited it for 15-20 minutes. So when I wrote it, game was slowed down for a minute. Part 2. Playing. It was easy and fast to make character and playing first mission. I selected NORD RACE!!11!!!ONE. And nightblade class. After some missions I just stopped completing them and begun to STEAL ♥♥♥♥ING THINGS!!!!111!!!!ONE. I was very lucky doing this. And I found a bag: If you restart the game, your fine will be annuled.

            "review_text": "I can only judge this game as one of the few games I've played entirely with a friend. I've LVLed almost entire alongside my friend, so with I must say that Elder Scrolls Online, compared to other MMOs in it's field, has a long ways to go. Its been an entirely joyous adventure creating my character, whether it be an assassin, mage, or warlock, Ive done this with ONE character. No other MMO has let me customize, and build up a character, scratch that direction, and keep my fella and build him up to be something else. The 15 monthly is the biggest problem in the back of my mind, Id hate to abandon ship and leave this awesome character because of something so trivial as a subscription, but there are some other issues to blame as well. The foundation that Bethesda has shipped this game out on is bland, the bank is interesting, but if you dont know anyone that is a part of a good guild that deposits items in the guild bank...Good luck. The Dungeon system is a joke, youll spend hours trying to find takers to your cat calls for people to unite, only for them to drop out midway through. Nope, in this age of instant gratification there are NO LFGs, so onto the map. The map so far has to be where my bipolar mix emtions reside. The beginners island was just that, the post secondary island is a chaotic mess of missions and horses(ohh yeah horses are annoying, they are still the MMO moster trucks much like Skyrim, so at least you have that similarity going for you SKYRIM fanboys) There are always issues with this game in regards to errors, either you cant see your group for periods that span a quest, or a whole guild quest is lost because you left s portal by clicking the exit beyond the portal itself(ive totally lost out on the mage guild), to put it short its clunky, youll get used to it, but its still not worth charging someone monthly. Thats a place in gaming for the golden goose, there is not two or three, gaming should be highlander style, there can be only one. If you dont meet that bar yet, dont ask the same dedication from your fan base.(But in the age of corporatism, its now or never) Back to the game... No, the maps are pretty much quest whoring left and right, with no real purpose other than to make your head spin around and never do anything short of confuse you with why you care. And the storyline is based on such a boring monotonous story, Ive hardly persued it at all, but no need for popcorn so far. The land is beautiful in Bethesda's sharp texturey sorta way, but it plateaus, you spend alot of time skipping the reason Elder Scrolls is so cool. The quests are boring, they are voice acted, but who cares when you would rather not read or hear them in the first place. But back to the scenery, so far the towns are the meat and potatoes of the traveling, but when youve seem one camp or cave, youve pretty much seen them all. Again, the character you develope is as emmersive as you will ever get and its great to been linked what ive created so far, that part is amazing, but on solo times I get the time to really analyze the game to its full potential, and thats when I start to ask for more. People that are supporting this game deserve more than a Beta, they arent calling it that, and they sure as hell arent charging for that. 70%",

BUY THIS GAME.  NONE OF THEM EVEN COMPARE! If you always wished MMO's had a skill element beyond building your character AND could also be immersive AND could have objective based quests AND Looked holy balls amazing AND be truly fun to play solo or in a group then this is the game for you.  BUY THIS GAME.  I love that I can complete quests how I want and that completion gives me the vast majority of my XP. As a stealth chacater I fight much less then say a sword and board Templar. I also have absurd amounts of money becouse you can actully steal from houses and pickpocket NPCs if your good at it. If your caught you either lose gold and all your stolen posseions or you can try to escape, in which case there is a decent chance you will get killed by guards unless you are both lucky and good (or have picked out a great location to disapear to).  BUY THIS GAME  Yes there are only 4 classes but you could make a dozen characters and have them all be diffrent. And not just a little, a crazy amount. You could make a two templars that were more diffrent then one of your templars and your sorcerer with little difficulty.  BUY THIS GAME  Some people complain about the Cash Shop. Yes there is a cash shop. It is 95% cosmetic. The only things you can buy that affect game play are potions that you could make anyway with and alchemist build, improving carry capacity, mount stamina, mount speed none of which affect combat or pvp and experience as you can't fight on a mount, xp boosts at a static 10% if you buy a supscription or a 2h 50% and even wow and GW2 will sell you entire levels or groups of levels so thats still less pay to win. There are a few other things, but they can all litterally be purshased with gold in game and not a abusrd amount. Also when you subscribe you get just as much cash shop money as if you bought it on its own secondary, and again every time your subscription re ups. So its really just subscrip and we will give you pretty things.  BUY THIS GAME  It is not glichy at all as people complain. There are a few minor gliches but no more then any other MMO wich is impressive for its size and scope. There may have been tons at lauch I have no idea I didn't play at launch. But if there were there gone now.  DID I MENTION BUY THIS MONDAY TO FRIDAY GAME!!!   Also pro choice, go Aldmeri Dominion. Awsome NPCs. But thats more of a prefrence I guess then a choice.

The game doesn't have the graphics of skyrim, tho if it were possible there would be a lot less players in the world because of the fact that you would need a preety beefy computer to run it, tho the graphics are nice. The main storyline of the game is good tho it could be better. The sidequest are awesome they are dinamic in story and in adventure. Before buying this game i was hesitant to buy it because of all the negative reviews i've heard and i did hate this game when it first game out because of the fact that i had to buy the imperial edition just to play as an imperial, But in the end it was worth it. This is now my main MMO that i play and i will continue to play it untill the game dies or is just not fun anymore, but i mean it's in Elder Scrolls game it's never going to be not fun. I would give this game a 9/10 for the fact that the main storyline isn't that great, but it's still good. I would recomend this to anybody that is an Elder Scrolls fan or an MMO fan. The game is B2P meaning but it once and play as long as you like no lvl resrictions everything is there. You will however have to buy the DLC's that come out ther are only 2500 crowns if i'm not mistaken which would add up to $30 to $40. I hope this review was helpful to anyone that is looking to buy this game.",

            "review_text": "I'll keep it simple; this game is amazing, but it's got sooo many flaws. I've boiled them down to my main 5 complaints:  1. Very difficult to get into it, the learning curve and random quest spacing makes you feel like you're leveling incredibly slowly, regardless of what you're doing.  2. Forums are impossible to use. If you're like me and were a part of the Beta Testing, you were never given a key to join the forums. You need to physically go through their Customer Support and have them set up a profile for you manually.  3. Customer Support is IMPOSSIBLE to get in touch with. I did everything within my power to try and get in contact with someone, but I was redirected to random unhelpful pages telling me that my only solution was to contact Customer Support.  4. Community is a big part of every MMO. You'll have players that spend their whole life in-game, and you'll have those that really don't play that often, then everything inbetween. This game is kinda empty, given there isn't really a community behind it. The ones that do play are either new, or incredibly hardcore about playing. Make a single mistake when running a dungeon and you'll get the boot, regardless of what it is. Same rule applies for a lot of their other 'activites'.  5. Paid Expansions.. This always irritates me.. So they advertise 'no subsciptions', which sounds great - until you want to actually play some of the expansion content that they are shoveling out by the boat load. Don't get me wrong, it's amazing stuff, but they make it so difficult to access, and then put it up behind a pay-wall. So not only do you have to purchase their expansion content, you have to pay a subscription to access that same content that you just purchased. I don't understand that, especially in a game that is advertised as 'no subscription'.  Outside of that, the game is pretty great. I'll recommend it to people who want a grind MMO with a good storyline, but if you want a solid all-around MMO.. I don't know if it'll be the one you're after.",

PvE is stellar, the community of players is strong, crafting is acually valuable like the single player entries, PvP is crazy good, and although there is no subscription it's not play to win even remotely.  The only real complaint I have, which I have no doubt will be addressed over time is the lack of a real arena. Given the origins of the series, it boggles the mind to me that this wasn't incorporated earlier. Then again, the Arena was left out of Skyrim as well.   All in all, this is the electronic crack your parents and friends warn you about. If you have even a mildly addictive personality type this may not be the wisest purchase to make, but you'll enjoy every moment of it until you find yourself in an intervention with your family and any real world friends you don't drag down with you.   9.5/10 - Would gladly listen to the nice man in the Zenimax van in front of the playground telling me 'The first one's free kid.' again.",

I'm playing around with the launchers and such to figure out how it is getting that data but I have spent many hours in this so far. **What I can tell so far, for me at least, steam is only counting the time I spend on the launcher/updater and not the actual game.  I wanted to give my 2 cents as there are only 13 hours left for people to buy this on sale. I purchased this game, and then became wary of some of the negative reviews I saw.  Now, MOST of the negative reviews post-unlimited are about things before you even start the game. Seriously? They complain about the size of the game, the ammount of patches, the fact that you have to register an account and tell them you don't want to pay per month for extra content and they also do a bit of verification emails very similair to how steam operates.  So far I have seen nothing worth complaining about. I have not actually played the game yet because I just got past all that I mentioned above. Don't let the download size scare you, it's an MMORPG what do you expect?  I will update in a few hours after I have played.  (Some of the negative reviews are bogus, one individual claimed this was a Blizzard game and said that they always hated Blizzard games and would never purchase a Blizzard game again.)  UPDATE - Ok guys, i'm sorry I couldn't get this review updated before the sale ended (life happened.)  This game is actually very interesting from what I have seen so far. The class system looks small and constricting at a glance but you can use any weapons and armor with any class and the mixing of skills makes for a huge number of combinations.   The game itself is well-played. It starts off kind of slow (especially if you came from playing hundreds of hours in skyrim) because you feel like you want to jump right into the thick of things, but it eventually catches you up to speed on the particular mechanics (like crafting etc.) before letting you lose.  There is no shortage of quests (Come on, all MMOs are like that. Even skyrim and fallout are that way.)   So far I give this game a huge thumbs up. I will warn you, coming from Skyrim will confuse you. This is not skyrim. The combat system and skill system is built like an MMO. That doesn't make it bad, it makes it different and fits the game it is supposed to be.  The only quarrel I have with this game is FPS issues. I run a decent set-up that runs skyrim with 200 mods, I ran fall-out 4 decently well but this game I haven't quite tweaked my settings for it. (But as new games come out, my system gets older and it's harder to keep up anyways. That's just the nature of the game. But if you CAN run it, this game looks really nice on ultra settings.)   I will continue to update as I delve in deeper (gotta avoid my habit of constantly creating new toons.) I look forward to my first dungeon.",

It's almost like other TES games in that matter.  If you are going to spend a lot of time PVEing, group dungeons are a must, it is challenging in a fun way. Remember, if you don't know what to do in a dungeon, just ask others in the group.  Just don't play this for the lore and story.

You can roam in any area and the level will be 'sync'd'.   Only downside for me is they often overpriced stuff a little.",

Ive been playing it for about 11 hours at the time of writing and ive had a good ol' time and only reached lvl 8 (out of roughly 50 levels) but in that 11 hours i was never bored and more importantly i enjoyed my self. I didnt feel the need to rush max level so i didnt, as theres alot of questing and exploration (and story things) you can do.   It truely is like a slightly different version of skyrim (with a, in my opinion, better combat system then (tho very similar) skyrim) except you can play solo AND with friends, over various zones and lots of Small things from the solo Elderscrolls games are left intact (that are generally taken for granted when they go missing in a normal MMO).   For example;  1. You can still crouch to sneak. 2. You can still take things from npc's (my helm and boots are uh...less then legally obtained) 3. Play in first OR third person. (id say first person is fine for any thing PvE related like quests, but would say 3rd person would be a must for pvp) 4. Craft gear freely 5. Hit Npc's (and gain a bounty) 6. Run around collecting random Plants with a uncontrollable zeal that would scare most men away.(wood or other various crafting items)  Now sure there are some 'negatives' but really id say theyre just nitpicky things from me.  1. Map isnt fully unlocked atm, theres still alot of land open with lots too do but all of the 'big' zones like skyrim or morrowind are locked last i looked at said map. 2. Class/skill system could use alot more coverage. I looked all around for exactly how the thing works and only managed to find generally speaking out dated info or info that you cannot verify that is correct. So im kinda just yoloing my spec and hoping i have enough skill points at the end. (and i did search for a few hours looking at the 'class' guides but i couldnt find more then like 1-2 that were for post tamriel unlimited.) 3. I dont like how my horse desummons when i get off (or that i instantly mount it when i summon) but i understand this one as it would lead to ppl trolling people with lower grade systems with 100 horses+100 players in a very small zone, so this is really only a .5 problem imo. 4. the Tutorial and the quests ive completed didnt really give me a choice in the gear they gave. i picked the 'Stealth' class and i keep getting random heavy armor items and mage weapons. i got lucky and got a bow from the tutorials end, but was running through it with a 2h weapon which was a lil odd for me. I also didnt have any medium armor (the kind that seems to be good for this type of character) til i stole some, and crafted the rest. which i had to look around checking npc's for bout 30 minutes til i figured out how to get the mats for it (im a lil slow ok).  but despite those tiny 3.5 'problems' i can forsee myself playing this for a few months easily.  Id only recommend this to a skyrim lover IF they arnt exactly looking for a clone of that, this is very skyrimesque but its not possible for an MMO to bring the same level of immersion and such that a single player game can. but for any one who likes MMO's id definitely recommend they atleast try it.",

Don't get me wrong it was competitive, but it's competitive repitition of skill combos, felt very robotic. This game feels a lot more organic with combat. The storytelling is good, but could be better, the skill system is a wonderful change from the stale versions you get from WOW and other cardboard cutout versions of that game type. I hate WoW, but this is fun. Seriously though you can almost mistake it for being a single player elder scrolls game until you look at the skill systems, but they aren't bad considering they had to balance it somehow for online play. I think the biggest problem though is the merchant system, nothing to do with how it is run, but as far as the game economy goes a lot of items you get won't be worth all that much and I'm sure they have a good reason for it, but the WOW economy was so complicated and real it was featured in many economic magazines.   Keep in mind when playing this game they haven't polished everything and it might be a year or two before they really put everything togather as an amazing game considering it runs on the no subscription model, but its plenty fun in the mean time. So my recommendation is to play, but keep your expectations low so you don't hate the game because it's not as finished as World of Warcraft was.",

With the subscription cost gone and a MAJOR improvement to the gameplay, this game has the potential to be the best MMORPG. The quests dont feel linear or mediocre, but rather capture the player with its depth and creativity. The world may not be as expansive as a game like WoW. But quality over quantity. ESO paints the world rather than merely sketching it. Crafting is now desired rather than dreaded, and gathering resources isnt too difficult.   However ESO fails as a core RPG. The combat is bland, with only 5 skills and 4 classes to choose from. When the enemies start to aggro, I start to sigh as the combat is very limited. Personally, I feel the point of an RPG is to be able to become someone you arent in the real world. ESO fails to replicate WoW's ability to do so. While some people argue that ESO is supposed to be flexible, like a mage can be a magical assassin wielding daggers, the skill bar is still limited to only 5 combat skills. There are a lot of passives that can make combat enjoyable. But with 5 or less available action skills there is much less options available when combat begins, making fighting a bore. With MMORPGs like World of Warcraft or Tera there are a lot skills which chain and interact with each other, while the bosses change their behavior making combat much more refreshing.   I am just giving my honest review on ESO. All I want to do is help the conflicted consumer out with a two sided argument on the game. I could care less what the fanboys have to flame about. All in all, if you like the scenery, world interaction then grab it but consider the shortcomings of the game as well. ",

Even if you are playing alone, without friends, you still gonna recieve help from other players :) Big open world, seriously that map is huge and if in other games you might use fast travel, then here running your way on your feet is better, some of the views worth it. Evereywhere you go there will be quest, after which another one and they never end.  Cons:  Group loot system. Sometimes other players can be annoying. Boss mechanics sometimes broken and works sometimes in bad way, example: In first dungeon boss cast on you green laser which does alot of damage, as i found out you can 'escape' his focus if you go outside of his sight, but still he kilsl trough walls sometimes.

The community is really really nice. The grahpics is good. FPS is fine never had a lag. Great voice acting. Tons of stuff to do on just a single map. You can steal things. and theres a black market too to sell your stuff(the one you stole though). Over all this game is 9/10 for me.

So far this is one fan-freaking-tastic game. I can't wait to figure out crafting, PvP, dungeons, raids, etc. The game seems deep.

            "review_text": "The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited is a fantasy game.  It is replete with elves, trolls, wizards, and other characters from the fantasy genre. You run around with a sword, fighting various magic-infused people and demons, looting dead bodies, and solving the occasional puzzle.  From what I played of it, it seemed rather linear, with your options to go off on your own being rather limited.  However, it should be noted that I played this game on a free weekend, so my experiences with it were, of necessity, rather limited. Nonetheless, I played it enough to gain a general impression.  Apparently it was first released in April 2014, but the style looks a bit dated, as if it was made ten years prior to that. Nonetheless, there certainly seems to have been a lot of work put into it, providing a long storyline to hold your interest.  As an aside, I should mention that my computer plays the vast majority of games with no problems, but it struggled a bit with this one - my PC was beeping at me constantly, to let me know it was having an asthma attack; I changed all of the graphics settings to their lowest levels, and then the computer seemed to breathe a lot easier, although loading the game did take a fair while. (Battlefield 1 is the only other game that makes my PC beep at me.)  Whilst I wouldn't rave over The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, it was relatively enjoyable enough. If you like fantasy games, then it might be worthwhile buying this one, especially if it is on sale.  5.5/10.",

One can get lost in doing the many quests; each quest has a story but one has to pay attention (the talking NPCs make that easier) and all side quests are optional of course. Don't have to worry about level before moving to next zone as you will be scaled up, however you do need to worry about gear and skills (with gear needing to be updated every 10 levels). The 'One Tamriel' update definitely made things better.  I myself have chosen the path to doing as many quests as I can, talking it slow, immersing myself into the world, being a murderer, a thief, a jack-of-all-trades crafter (Certified in all crafts), collector of skyshards and lorebooks.  I am probably getting the DLCs, would love to do heists in Thieves' Guild DLC.   Definitely can spend hundreds if not a few thousand hours on this game; especially if I spend so much time in the campaign/alliance war, planning, invading, defending, all as a horde or just completing every dungeon in the map or collecting every skyshard or lorebook without getting constantly ambushed/killed by enemy alliance players.

A lot has been added since launch and it could be worth reconsidering.  Reasons I like this game: - Large open world - Good MMO experience - No longer requires a subscription - Huge amounts of content (I've played for over 100 hours and still feel like I'm just beginning) - Fun with friends to do dungeons and quests together - Many interesting and fairly balanced mechanics and abilities - Addons bring many QoL fixes and changes to the UI and simplify micromanagement, with fairly easy installment (though difficult to transfer settings between characters) - Many options and keybinds with support for up to 5 keys per bind.  Reasons I dislike this game: - Poor performance. Even on an i7-4790k and GTX 970 I get horrendous (like sometimes down to 20ish) framerate drops in crowded areas and even when I'm in a solo instance where performance is better, framerate is hard capped at 100. - Vanilla game feels lacking in graphics and UI. After playing with ReShade, the game without it just looks so bland and washed out. The UI (especially in guild stores) can be cumbersome and requires addons to have the capabilities one would expect (e.g. a search function). - Many money-grabs in the form of timesavers, cosmetics, DLC, and extra account bonuses. - Many real-world timers, e.g. daily dungeons, daily horse upgrades, research timers, daily crafting writs - FOV goes up to '130' but feels about like 80, with the only way to increase it further being an extra game launcher (hook64) - Requires a third-party launcher that complicates playing through Steam and using custom launchers like hook64 - Long load times - Large install size (~65GB) - Cannot activate a Steam version if you bought the standalone game  All in all, most negatives can be mitigated through the use of addons and extra programs, but your mileage may vary and the game becomes less stable by doing so. However, a lot of these should be simple fixes for ZOS to implement in the vanilla game. That said, the positives do outweigh the negatives and when everything works, it's a very engaging and rewarding game to play that will satisfy you for hundreds of hours.",

The game still needs a arena part for PvP, but it will hopefully be implanted later on. The recent justice-system update have really given the game a nice touch as you can now trespass, pickpocket and steal all you like or murder an intire city (as long as you either pay the price for your mayham or prepare to take on the city guards).

Simply put the game is Beautiful. Its everything i could ever want out of the elder scrolls online, I'd rate it out of every game ive played since the early 90's online, to be the best out of the lot.  The graphics are Fantastic, i ran it maxed out and it still wasnt 'enough' for me, so i ran it through Nvidia's control panel and Maxed it out with Super Sampling and Basicly every single setting on Maximum Graphics, and the quality is superior to any other title ive played to date now.  So overall 10/10 for everything.  The only thing that could possibly be added that would make the experience a lil more random.. would be just that, Randomness.. the possibility of running into random npc's in the wilderness with random quests or random assasins targetting you for breaking the law or the bounty on your head. Thats all ive got for yah though. as this game Slaughters any other ive ever played out there, its a keeper!",

I have played Elder Scrolls games since the Vvardefell and each time a new Scrolls game comes out there are people who are upset because it isn't like the previous. This is an MMO in all reality it is a different type of game than the past Elder Scrolls games. And just as in the past it is different than the previouse. All in all it is a very solid game, the quests even the side quests are well written and the game play is familiar. If you take some of your favorite MMOs there is some similarity in the controls but the majority is closer to past Scrolls games. I have had a great time playing this and it doesn't seem like a carbon copy of MMOs I have played in the past at all. As far as the F2P debate goes I am always on the side of subscription because it allows for not only a well supported game but for more submersion into the game as well. I have play some ok F2P games but haven't really seen any that I could call great. But everybody is different.  So in short buy the game and play it, it is fun and a still evolving MMO world.

I haven't yet had much experience with PvP, and perhaps I will alter this review in the future to reflect my thoughts on it. Currently I would recommend this game for those folk I know who would enjoy exploring more of Tamriel because the storyline and side-quests really help to flesh out the world and its inhabitants.  There are a couple of things that absolutely take away from the immersion. For instance: The dialog choices are basically non-existent. In regards to about 90% of interactions I have had with NPCs, there is only one response you can choose. There is no way to roleplay any kind of personality other than the one the developers have chosen for you, which really detracts from the whole 'Elder Scrolls' feeling of the game.   Overall, I give it a 7/10. Give it a try if you can find it on sale, and play for the 30 days that are included free. Draw your own conclusions from this game, because it has both strong and weak points.",

It is literally a MMO of Skyrim.  People keep down-voting it because it is not Skyrim. Go and play Skyrim if you want Skyrim!! This game has got similar mechanics to Skyrim, but it has that MMO touch, and I think they pull it off very nicely. Some of the scenes you will come across are just brilliant. It is a very beautiful game. And if you thought Oblivion/Skyrim was beautiful, you are in for some surprises.   The sounds. Wow, some of the sounds in-game are fantastic too. My favourite being the thunder and lightning effects. Really gives you the feeling you are going to get picked off by something... and fast.   The combat mechanics are really good too. It gives you the feeling of playing Skyrim, but of course, you are not. The quest are as you would expect. “You, stranger, do this for me, then go here and do this” but you cannot escape that with an MMO game. I personally think this is better that WoW, but that’s just me. I have indeed played WoW and grew bored rather quickly. The one thing I would suggest to Bethesda is to implement a variety of Skill Bars so I can customise it for each of my weapons/traits.  So, for any idiots saying “THIS IS NOTHING LIKE SKYRIM, OMG, DON’T GET IT WAHH” *CRY LIKE BABY* need to shut up. If you want a game like Skyrim, I suggest you go and play Skyrim. As this game will not quench your Skyrim needs. The price is indeed a bit steep, but for a true fan of the game, I would recommend it. I do it for the company, as they need money to keep servers up and running, and to keep updates rolling out. The game is fantastic, beautiful and the atmosphere is just awesome! 9.5/10 ",

First off, no, its not a standrd Elder scrolls game, so if thats what you're looking for, look else where, but it is a fabulous take on the MMO genera. My favorite part about this game is that it is unique, I haven't played anything like it. At least for me, the quests were either diverse enough that I haven't yet felt like I'm questgrinding or the voice acted dialouges make the story interesting enough that I haven't noticed a grind yet... The crafting system is unique too, and IMHO well done, thought there are pieces that stilll need to be added, like the ability to craft jewelry. The live action combat is nice, no more clicking to target your enemies.   Eventhough it's not quite as open world as a standard Elder scrolls game, it still feels like one to an extent, and I would have no problem recomemnding the game to a friend.",

Afterall, this would be the first time the Elder Scrolls series would ever go online. Additionally, I feared it would follow in the footsteps of World of Warcraft, a game I enjoyed for a time but quickly grew tired of. On another side, I was excited due to the enormous game world and ability to play with friends. This would be the first time since The Elder Scrolls I: Arena that we would be able to traverse across much of Tamriel.  Once I got a hold of the game, I quickly began to like the it. The main story is very well-written and compelling. The faction quests had me hooked, and the limitless things you can do has startled me, a long term Elder Scrolls fan. That said, it is necessary to dissolve some of the issues that people have been talking about. It is important to note that this is not Skyrim Online. If that is what you want, then it is not here I am afraid.   Rather than bringing online functionality to Skyrim or any of the previous Elder Scrolls games, Zenimax has brought Elder Scrolls as a whole to the MMO world. There is a huge difference between the two. It means that much of what you have in an MMO has been incorporated, and it is important to understand that some of the liberties we had in the previous games will not be present due to this fact. This does in no way mean you get a linear game. On the contrary, this game allows you to explore and quest at your own pace. Just remember that there are a few minor limitations that you may have to get used to if you are not an MMO fan.  Lastly, the game has vastly improved since I first bought it, and I expect it to continue to improve in the coming days. This game is a fantastic game in its early years with great questing, fantastic graphics and landscapes, and exciting PvP. I strongly recommend it to people who love MMO's and the Elder Scrolls series. Not one or the other, but both. Happy questing!    Score: 7/10",

The game so far even though im only a level 9, has been great. havent been bored yet even after playing 6 hours straight. i havent been much repedetive either. Most of the quest's ive completed throughout the 7 hours ive played so far are completely different from the last!   With the purchase you get a free month without payment to play, even though it is going to suck to pay the $15 a month i most certainly will! well atlest untill i get bored of it, or if i end up playing destiny more than this game since destiny comes out sept. 9th! But either way, weither im going to play for two months until destiny comes out or weither im going to keep playing while i play destiny, the price you pay is worth it!   Story is compelling, gamplay is awesome just like skyrim! i know i can drain many hours and many months (along with money) into this game! And hearing the rumors that it may be a free to play game in the future ( as in after you pay for the original game) makes it even better!   Havent had any problems, running at ultimate settings is pratically the same graphically as skyrim, story so far ( 6hrs in) is great and keeps me intacted even with the side missions.  YOU get what you pay for and in the instence its perfect!",

            "review_text": "First, let me start off by saying that this is the first MMORPG i've ever owned. Although I did play the free version of WoW, I really don't think that counts. So let me start off with the positive points of the game, the customization you can do with armour is really incredible, they have beginners quests to get you into blacksmithing, enchanting and crafting in your starting city. Also, the other players are pretty awesome and will usually help you out if you ask, not to mention every time I log in there's always some funny stuff in the zone chat. Another positive is the graphics, I know the game wasn't entirely made by Bethesda but I have to say that I believe the graphics are a huge improvement from an unmodded Skyrim. There's also a unique leveling system for the mounts that you ride, you can upgrade their speed, stanima or carrying capacity every 19 hours which for me is a huge incentive to log on every day. Theres tons of skills you can learn and each race has their own distinct set of abilites, so although you can create your character however you want, thats something to keep in mind. An example would be, a wood elf who primarily focuses on 2 handed swords. While that would work somewhat, the main skills of a woodelf are archery based. One of the biggest cons i've noticed so far is that this is DEFINITELY a game where you have to occasionally grind to gain levels. The enemies that you fight don't give you a ton of experience so youre going to want to focus on quests to level your character but sometimes you have to grind just to be strong enough for your next quest. I'm at a point in the game where quests my level are starting to become hard to come by..meaning i've spent hours looking for a quest that is around my level to no avail. That has to be one of my biggest complaints of the game. Another would be that, for me at least, it is kind of hard to find new equipment my level, an example would be that I have a lvl 18 wood elf character and ive been using a lvl 8 bow until just recently I got a lvl 17 one from a quest. All in all, if you enjoy offline elder scrolls games, youre going to like this one.",

However, there isn't many options for weapons, only six skill lines for them are available at the moment.  However, even over a year after the games release, there's still loads of bugs that you'll run into on a daily basis that don't get fixed for months.

I love the lockpicking and the justice system.  If someone else has bought the vampire or werewolf dlc, they can bite and turn you despite you being f2p.  This is a great game if you're looking to roleplay and explore Tamriel with a friend.  I tried healing a dungeon as a level 14 Templar and it was definitely DIFFICULT, which is the opposite of a WoW dungeon. I died a few times, but with mana pots I managed to heal through the whole dungeon. If you like doing dungeons but are tired of them being easy, you should try out TESO.",

Get soul gems...... a lot of soul gems...... - There's more to combat than any other Elder Scrolls game. - Controls resemble that of an MMO. - Has its own economy. One can sell items in guild stores, these items can be bought by people to guild and non-guild members. Items include: armors, weapons, potions, food, treasure maps, XP potions etc. - I can marry my best friends and get an XP boost for playing with them (boost is stacked ontop of other XP boosts). - ESO Plus is a cheap way to get access to all DLC when the game is not on sale is one cannot sacrifice a large amount of liquidity at one time. - Arenas to fight monsters in. - Ancors fall from Oblivion into Tamriel which one or a group can defeat the enemies to claim prizes including: currency, armor, potions, weeapons, and I think food possibly.

Enemy battles are awesome and at times challenging without group play interaction. I like to be the Explorer kind of player, and it's not always possible with constant group-play interaction ( Too many cooks spoil the broth ), so I usually went solo until I needed help with multiple ememies ( More than 3 enemies at once ), ( eg at Anchors, Siege Battles or Epic Boss Battles ). I found or he found me, another player wearing a Clown mask ( Forget his user I.D ? ) who had a complimentary fighting style similar to my own, which made chalenging battles easier.  Now for the ♥♥♥♥♥y part/s:  The leveling system is slow and tedious and could use a major upgrade like ( Skyrim ) hasd? Better lootable items would be nice also. As it is, powerful weapons and armor are rare and/or hard to find as well as adequate crafting materials to make your own. Fast travelling is also not so user friendly as in past Elder Scrolls games; ( Wayshrines............Ugh!!!!..........How Morrowind can you get!!!! ); Oblivion and Skyrim fast travelling would be preferred. There are some other annoyances that I can't remember or don't need to get into as I feel Iv'e ♥♥♥♥♥ed enough..... :-)  Overall though, I quite enjoyed this version of this Epic Franchise and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys these types of RPG games.

Every quest has a story behind it, which is something that stopped me from playing WoW way back when. In my opinion the PvP system is unparalleled.

Need REVAMP OF GROUP. You pick things up, quest items you earn, practically worthless to merchants and many times worth “0 gold”. REVAMP merchants to buy materials needed to fulfill quests and etc. You pay through the nose from Merchants for stuff you don't use...bad development decisions. 1,000s gold you earned from quests for a few perks on a horse or a bag once a day on horse? Developer decisions in this game stink in many regards. ESO COULD BE A LOT FUNNER SO DEVELOPERS ARE TO BLAME. IMPORTANT GET INTO A GUILD! Solves a lot of the non-fun $$ things.

I have several high level characters, and a group of friends recently started playing - all starter characters. Even then, we can group up and quest and somehow the fights are the same difficulty for me as it is for my buddies. The only difference is I have more advanced skills to use and cooler looking armor. Aside from that, it's just as though I started my character with them. It's amazing and a ton of fun. We were runing dungeons together and taking on world bosses in the first few hours they joined.  And even though my characters have reached the 'level cap', the champion points and New Game Plus style storylines makes prevents the game from getting old. Great writing makes the quests enjoyable to do and not a grind.   They also have Arenas for survival style fights with cool rewards. PVP is just insane...you can write an entire post about that.

THis game lives up my expectations and honelsty it is a MMORPG and it fufills my needs for a MMORPG. The story is pretty good and involves a lot of Molag Bal which can never go wrong. So thats why i htink this game is actually on the level of maybe morrowind if not a bit better. Oblivion was better but not by much and SKyrim is still untouchable. but what they have in common is that its all Elder Scrolls.

I highly recommend buying the game directly from The ESO website, and NOT on Steam. Cut out this awful middle man, save yourself some grief. Zenimax Online's customer service got back to me within 2 hours of filing a ticket. Steam never got back to my ticket at all.  As for the game itself? Two thumbs way up. I had played in the beta, got bored after 30 minutes, never touched it since. I came back after reading up on all the things they had fixed, along with incoming features. Suffice to say, this is the best MMO I've played in years.  The questing is fully voiced, and the quests are actually fun and interesting, with lots of lore built in. I have to say, it actually really does remind me of playing through an actual Elder Scrolls game! If you take your time to actually enjoy it like you would, say, Skyrim, then you will definitely get that Elder Scrolls experience. It won't be the same, of course, as it's a distilled version mixed with cleverly implemented MMO elements, but it's a great experience nonetheless. I appreciate the developers' efforts to make the levelling fun, and their great execution of the flexibility in skills and builds (two-handler wielding heavy armour battlemage? Yep, it's viable!)  I highly recommend buying the game, and giving it a chance. After a few hours, you'll find yourself drawn in if you allow yourself to enjoy the game - read things, listen, explore, have fun.",

What it was: Me trying to go to the place where I could do my first quest but constantly dying because a ~40 player squad was camping that exact spot so they could kill anything that comes near it. There is no option to turn PvP off or anything like that so the entire DLC area is technically rendered unplayable because even if you'd get your own giant squad the enemies can come in when you're fighting a boss (which will obviously leave you quite vulnerable to attacks since you are already taking damage from something else) and kill you to just take the boss for themselfes so they get the reward for killing it instead.  Long story short: The Imperial City DLC is basically prostitution since I just paid money so I could get f*cked by 40 people at once.",

This game can be fun - but just getting to max level is a pain and besides looking for better loot it really feels like the game goes nowhere.   The PvP warzone is kind of fun - but it's so chaotic and you spend most of your time just getting shot in the back. It doesn't feel very skillful and quickly burned out for me. Maybe if I had done more large scale raiding or something but ultimately I just didn't see what made me want to play this MMO over any others.   The truth is - this is a solid game but it's just like all the other grind for gear MMOs out there with labour intensive quests that are repetitive and don't feel like fun. I personally prefer a game like ArcheAge simply for all the crazy stuff you can do - like get killed and robbed. Newbs may not like it - but at least there are other things to do than wander around collecting bug sacs.   Don't get caught in the grind.

I'd be perfectly happy to be just a regular citizen that has to rise up in ranks through skills and given quest that would make sense in an mmo setting. This makes it hard for me to get into any of the story lines of this game, I just end up skipping through dialogue which is something I never or rarely do in elder scrolls games, because it just feels like I’m going through a haunted house in the carnival, it’s all “fake”. Half the time I have no idea what is going on in a quest, I just know I gotta kill the boss at the end, or retrieve some stuff, or burn some stuff, and I just end up grinding through quest to level up, rather than being fully immersed in the story line. It’s just… so boring. I think the reason why is because as someone who does only pve it’s just feels like I am doing the same thing over and over again, and with no story line to be invested in, it gets old quick.

The main problem I have with the game is the simplicity of the game mechanics. Specifically the lack of any sophisticated mechanics that add any element of strategy to the selection of skills or abilities. Ostensibly, there are only three relevant stats: Health, Magicka, and Stamina. Your combat abilities scale entirely based on Magicka or Stamina, depending on which resource they use. There is no further optimization of stats or choice of specialization, which would be acceptable if even those two stats mattered at all. As far as I can tell, your character recieves 20 points of each stat per level and a choice of where to add an additonal 10, up to a soft cap depending on your level which all but prevents you from specializing at all. So every character is going to have almost identical stats reguardless of desired specialization.   Moving on from stats to abilities, most abilities do nothing except various kinds of damage. Some do area damage, some have longer range, some have extremely minor debuffs that don't work on any enemies that actually matter. A small handful of abilities provide some variation, such as defense or moving yourself or enemies around. Since you only have 5 ability slots, each of these abilities cuts into your offensive ability.   The aesthetics of the game are acceptable, but nothing to write home about. They seem to have opted for a hybrid of the realistic style of TES games, mixed with the cartoony style of most fantasy MMOs. I think they would have been better served by one or the other, most likely the former so as to appeal to TES fans who seem to have largely rejected the game already.",

This game is going to be awesome for the people that love the lore and like creating and being part of a guild etc etc.   the fighting just doesn't feel right, i will give them credit for trying to emulate the single player elder scrolls games.  But it just doesn't feel as nice, at times the timing is just off due to otherwise barely noticeable lag spikes.  for the price it is at right now I wouldn't buy it again. I am kind of sorry I did.  Hopefully it will get a bit cheaper in the future, then maybe it’s worth it. 60 bucks plus subscription fees seems too much.  If you get a deal on it for around 30 i would say its reasonable, and if you don't mind paying the subscription.  Fee to play would only make the game follow in the footsteps of so many mmo's that failed so i for one like that it has a subscription. That gives hope that the game will be getting updates and is being expanded.  So kind of a mixed recommendation here,  If you like the elder scrolls and want to explore the lands go ahead but don't expect skyrim with mmo aspects in it. it feels a lot more like morrowind to me when you play it after having played skyrim for days. kind of clunky but it still has some interesting things. The landscape looks interesting but like all mmo scattered with baddies that respawn after a while which only gets annoying after your pack is full and you just want to get back to a store and sell up.   overall i have to say no, mainly because of the price of the game versus the actual game that you get. it's a subscribed game so they wouldn't need to jack the price that high since if you want to keep playing it you will keep paying them. but that is my opinion.

Even if you came from the depths of the 9th plane of hell you still know how to make the most basic food stuffs. Let down #1. Let down #2 was the fact that you cant switch from bow to sword untill you are level 15. Even at level one in ALL the previous games (from Arena to Daggerfall to Morrowind to Oblivion to Skyrim, and yes I have them all) you could switch during combat. Its a natural thing to do. Plink em from a far and if they get close switch and finish them with the sword or dagger. Let down #3 was probably one of the biggest. Where are all the herbs and ingredients for making potions and the like? After 48 hours of play and lots of running around looking for crafting materials I had hardly found much of anything useful. Granted in the other games you had to search the barrels and crates but in most of them if you were inside someone elses home and you even looked in a crate or barrel you had the Guard coming after you. now crates and barrels are the only places to 'find' recipes and items to make food or crafts???? I dont know what Bethesda was thinking but I think, and this is strictly my opinion, they should have stuck to the genre that they did so well for more than a decade. Its not a total loss though. They will still make money off the other folks who like Dark Age of Camelot and other titles like that.

The game has its flaws but overall it is an awsome game BUT BUT BUT there is a massive server connection issue. Before you say anything YES my firewall is set up... router is set up - I did everything I could find on forums or on ESO offial troubleshooting web site. The game plays at times nicely for few hours and than it starts to disconnect for various irrational reasons such as I have been disconeted because apparently I used up message space (basicly for spaming) even though I did not send any messages and for sure I was not spaming. As I said I am a newbie into those kind of games so I do it solo as much as I can for now so I am not interacting with other people much. But about 95 percent of disconects happens without any warning so all of a sudden you just go into a log off screen an it happens sometimes 3 times a minute - yes minute and I log in and log of straight away. Some quest are done over few hours even though they should be done within 20 minutes. Yes I have 130 hours on my account but at least 40 per cent is in and out of loading screen and it does not correspond with actual play time.  So it is very frustating to try to play.

I hope I will be able to change my rating in the future.

It is hard as ♥♥♥♥ for me to hit that not recommended button, but for now it must be so. I will gladly change it if more improvements happen. Yes yes, it is b2p now but it is still not that good. So I will focus on what I dislike about this game:   - character generation sucks big time: What year is this? Last time I checked it was 2015. not 2010. Characters are ugly, whatever you do you will simply make another twin to your previous character of same race, not enough variety of anything regarding to the facial/body features and no character physics! ESO team should really look up towards the Eastern MMO games and their character creation and their physics. And no, I am not talking about bouncing boobs, I don't care about that.   - classes: I get the idea that you wanted to allow players a larger variety of gameplay styles - but don't do it in this way. Basically, whatever class you pick won't matter because you can play all other classes through it. Not to mention that you have only 4 to pick, where 2 are quite the same. So to be perfectly honest, ESO team created for us a SINGLE class to play, with 4 subclasses. WHY?! WHY?! WHY?!  - leveling up: If I understand it correctly, the only way to level up in this game is to do quests. Everything else takes forever. No comments how ♥♥♥♥ed up this is. -.-  - crime system: GREAT IDEA went horribly wrong! I adore it that I can sneak, still, pickpocket and kill... BUT, when those ♥♥♥♥ing guards catch me and I start to run - I've been killed through WALLS, I've been killed from HUGE distances with arrows, I've been killed through ♥♥♥♥ing MOUNTAIN!!! How pathetic is that guys that you created your terminator guards with their godlike abilities that define all logic? What's the point in running away if you can't run away?!  - swimming, flying, climbing - what happened? ES Lore has a class that lives in swamps, in water and near water. Why was swimming not completed?! Why can't you climb? Why can't you glide or fly or whatever? Again - what year is this? We are surely not in the 2015. with this game.   - still buggy: I've red that ESO until Tamriel Unlimited was buggy as hell and that they've fixed it. Well, I can state that in my 20-30 hours of gameplay I've encountered broken quest bugs, unable to click/use something/someone bugs, I had 1 game freezing where I had to hard reset my computer...  All in all, this game is not yet ready to be truly enjoyed. It simply feels borring. It feels unfinished. I heard that you had 200 million dollars budget. That's a shame. You could've rather used 77 million to create a missle launch and launch this as far away from previous Elder Scrolls gems as possible.",

The 2 major issues in the game are that server is insanly over populated and you will contantly be bogged down with random lag in all areas of the game most of all in any of the captial towns which will stall you completly and often force log you out after a pre set lag grace, making the game more of a log in simulator than a MMO.    The 2nd major issuse is the customer support is absolutly horrible, they are almost impossible to get in contact with and the call center has an average of 3-6 hour hold times if they dont just drop the call on you forceing you to call again and be requed. And when you finally get in contact with them they simply will not offer any solutions to the connectivity issue and refuse to refund any amount at all for any services already payed for after wasting as much of your time as possible trying to stall you from the real issues with mind nummingly stupid and pointless Q/A's,Forums, and basic Trouble Shooting while trying to blame you for the problem with the most rediculous accusations from your Internet service provider to the rotation of the earth lol.

After that it goes to Veteran 1-16 which is nothing but pure grinding. What I mean by that is spending countless hours doing the same stuff over and over again until you level. That is the most effective way in leveling. Ok lets say you finally got through hell and back and reached veteran 16. Great. What can I do now? Well you can run dungeons which is like any other normal dungeon you would find on a game like this. Cool. Now I am more interested in PVP. Well, there are no arenas, no battlegrounds. So what is the pvp in this game. IT IS A MINDLESS ZERG... Who ever has the biggest group wins.... The PVP in this game is so boring. Honestly, I regret playing this game.

Gameplay and atmosphere is quite solid however. to me though, the game doesnt act like it values your time, there are several levels missing that make succesful MMOs like wow feel alot more alive and not just a cash grab. paying for a dark brotherhood questline? i dont care how good the quest is, things like world of warcraft add an entire new continent, levels, classes, races, gameplay changes. you just dont get the same level of love in these dlcs. you could argue the other way because they are slightly more frequent but they just dont feel even worth buying.

This is not the sequel to skyrim, it has elements to remind you of the connection but thats where it all ends. Combat is shallow with auto aim kicking like a typical mmo.   I did not have a chance to experience PVP but there are many great youtube vids to cover that experience.   If you like mmo's there is plenty to like. Graphics, Voice acting are amongst my favs.  Compared with previous elderscroll titles and based on the feel, gameplay, custimisation (which was more then expected) and lore this would rank 5/10. Where oblivion and skyrim are almost perfect 10's.   Did not purchase for the 10$ as i prefer to go and replay one of the older titles. Hope that helps.   If you are considering this due to its relationship with previous elderscroll titles reconsider. If you are looking for a new mmo GLHF.   Technical Bug: Weapon sounds only.   Lastley the game failed 'out of the box'. I had to repair upon the first opening of the game due to only experiencing weapon swing sounds.

Cities and settlements are captured in true Elder Scrolls style in that they are unrealistically small, even for medieval-type cities. They are also much less interesting than many cities from Oblivion or Morrowind. As a member of the Daggerfall Covenant, I began in the city of the same name. The supposed capital of High Rock actualy appears to be smaller than many walled cities in skyrim, and most of them are pretty small. The landscape was repetitive and the graphics are somehow worse than skyrim's in many ways. The game runs incredibly poorly as well, with close to 30fps on medium settings in some areas with a GTX 970. The combat is a clunky Frankenstein's monster, stiched together from the systems traditionaly used in Elder Scrolls games, as well as the likes of World Of Warcraft. This results in some awkward finger placement if one wants to move and use abilities at the same time. The game does have some redeeming qualities though. The art design is quite good. It feels almost like a gloomier version of Oblivion. What really, REALLY annoys me about this game is the ignorance to the lore of the series. I find it hard to believe that by the time of the main series, everyone has somehow forgotten about how Molag Bal nearly conquered Nirn. No references exist in any other game and this makes the story seem somewhat forced and shoe-horned in to the lore awkwardly. I wouldn't be surprised if this game eventually goes the way of Age Of Reckoning (a much better game) and die.",

Over crowded. The dungeons and world are free to roam, for everyone. So it can be hard and annoying trying to grind or just have the time to level abilities up with everyone jumping onto your bad guy and beating him down... There is no experience except the 'use of the skill' type, and just because you hit the bad guy first does not make him your kill. You hit him once, a high level player will walk by and slap him down. So there you are only getting a couple of hits in on things here and there, makes leveling skills up super annoying. And with the over crowded, you are in a dungeon and five other people are there right on top of you, so same issue with all of them jumping in on your bad guy without you being able to do anything about it. I have tried to say fine, I will wait, let them move on, just wait for the respawn. Nope. More players are ready and waiting to take the place of any that might move on.  So yeah, Elder Scrolls is just as awesome of a game as the single player ones previously. You guys make some seriously awesome stuff. :) However, this online version is way too crowded and doesnt allow you any way of getting people off your kill, or from screwing up any fun that might be had.  Sorry Elder Scrolls, but I would not recommend this one. Close off the dungeons to just the ones that enter it as solo or groups, and this game would be perfection! But as it is, way too over crowded for the leveling system in place. Way too annoying with everyone rushing in and just killing everything in sight, not even caring about other people trying to have fun...",

In Elder Scroll online you can't kill guards, if you have a bounty in 1 city ALL cities know it which is stupid. If you like to play in a group you will notice that a lot of quest wont be shared. Some are but then a lot are not. So you just run near each other but each one has to do the quest. And then my biggest annoyance: They also need 6h to do the maintenance every week which is way too long. Unbelievable they need that long to install a few patches. And they do it from 9AM - 3PM my time. Sorry but normaly i play duirng these hours. After 3PM kids are home and then i can't play until the evening. So plan these maintenances during the night ( example 4AM-10AM) if you rly need that mch time. Personnaly i will never understand why they need 6h. 1 or 2h should be more than enough unless they don't know what they are doing.   I think it is too bad sneaking is not a leveling skill anymore. Now everybody can do it immediatly and doing it one a day or every single second result in the same skill. That's too bad.   PS: I would rate it average but i can't so i give it a negative feedback just because of the long downtimes during maintenance. If they fix it and reduce it to 1 - 2h it will change to positive.",

You will barely feel immersed in its world with hundreds of other players in the zone running in and killing all the mobs in front of you then just leaving. THis kind of gameplay experience is very standard in MMO's but it ruins the elder scrolls experience completely.   It is very addictive though, as are most themepark mmo's due to how easy they are and the want to get to max level as soon as possible. ESO is extremely easy. You will be able to blast through mobs 7 levels higher than you with ease and complete quests 5 levels above you quite often. These quests then give you rewards that are higher level than you, of which you can't equip for several levels.   I haven't quite gotten back to this game since it's gone buy 2 play, but it's definately a move in the right direction for ZOS. I'm sure the game is worth a buy now.

            "review_text": "This is a painfully avrage MMORPG. Even as a player with a passing intrest in the ESO lore and universe, this game just couldn't hold my intrest. All quests are voiced, which is a nice touch, but the glaring issue is that most players are going to click accept and subsuqently click the reward button while ignoring the details in between. As is custom with MMOs.  Which brings me to another glaring design flaw. There are 3 areas. After you reach level 50, you move on to the next area in the cycle. And when you veteran rank in that area, you move on to the third and final. When you grind out that last area. You get to grind all over again in the first zone you started in. It's painfully bland. Sure the exp, loot, and mobs will be higher tiered. But it is literally only grind at that point. There are no new skills an abilitys to look forward to. As once you reach 50 and grind out vet ranks, your rewards consist of passive points and crafting points. Grinding isn't all bad... But it isn't good either.  The crafting system however is EXCELENT. And addictive. It gives every bit of gear use and incentivises research of traits and point investment in your crafting trees. However after the newness wears dry, even crafting is fairly repetitive and mundane. Between the lack of classes, the lack of MEANINGFUL class diversity within classes, and the small number of skills that can be slotted at any one time. ESO give an impression of an MMO with training wheels WELDED on to the side of your motorcycle.  PVP is also poorly implemented. For some reason instead of scaling everyone to max level and stats... Your base stats only are leveled. Which means you grind the pve to have even a fair chance and PVP. Not that the pvp is ANYTHING BUT +600 ping groups of +60 players swarming any rival PC. The siege aspect is a joke. It's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome to tear down the doors of a rival keep while your other squad mates fend off enemies while you shoot your siege equipment. But keep defense is utterly broken. It is actaually more efficent to lose a keep and push a different one. Instead of defending it. And only a few trebuchets and balistas are usefull siege equipment. The rest could be useful if the game had better design.  In pve the loot drops blow. As the good buddy Zenimax wants you to buy from the cash shop. Gold is hard to find as loot, and most of your income comes from vendoring garbage, and stuggeling to decide to break down gear or vendor it. The auction house is also broken. There isn't a global trader. Instead guilds compete to own store fronts for 7 days, at ludicrious prices in bidding wars. Leading to cancerous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing in zone chat about price abuse, which may or may not be warranted. And it's almost worthless to even sell things to other players as they can just run a duengon a time or two to get a peer quality drop. Else they will consult their economey mods and demand a price that undercuts the actual value of the item. Especially for mats.  I wanted this game to be good. But for a 'free to play' mmo. It's entirely cancerous. Might have a better community on console, but I doubt it. On PC everybody seems stuck at the age of puberty, and it dosen't work as an MMO.... As a quasi single player experince it isn't too bad. But that's not what the game tries to be. Zenimax is a bad company that produced a garbage product. Even the DLC is bad. You have to be end game vet rank to play an of it. Which means more grinding, to grind some more. Go play WoW before the MMO genere dies of the malignant tumors that have plauged it for the last 8 years or so.",

Bug parts for fishing, carcases, ore, armour, weapons, herbs, ash, potions, and although these stack, the sheer amount is confusing and annoying as a sword takes up just as much room as a flower. Typical MMORPG bull that detracts from immersion. There is some guidance to what some objects do, but if your not sure what something does.. doesn't mean it does nothing. So selling things for 0 coins or destroying them just so you can collect more nonsense is just stupid. Also be careful what you pick up, there is no safety confirmation from stealing, so one mistake means death.. as a guard will hunt you down and kill you for picking up the wrong thing.. how do they know ?? again a break of immersion.  The size of the game is pretty huge, It took about 4 hours to download on steam, then 3 days to patch with constant Webget request failed messages.  The quest are OK but rather dull. There also hard to find, as there is no quest list in game, so knowing you found them all seems to be just luck. This was either pure lazyness, or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea of how things should be. The combat is a bit hit and miss. It seems you have very little time to react to incoming damage. Making you wonder.. why did I just die ? Then the repair bill degrades the gear as a penalty - on top of teleporting you to a strange shrine.  Be careful in water too, as there is no way to tell if fish will just eat you. You get a message don't swim in deep water.. but, no way to tell if that water is too deep. By the time you notice fish eating you, it's too late to turn around. Also failing damage is too hard to judge which can lead to more accidental deaths.  Social factors are lacking too, not one person seems to say anything, and it's a free for all with who ever gets to a chest 1st. So you can kill enemies to clear a way for someone else to run in and loot your hard earned gear. The emotes are good with nice animations but sadly to access them you have to type /dance .. so if you don't remeber the exact wording.. you can't do it.  All in all it feels like a poor consul port.

There is no error message if your review is too long and they make you think it is visible!  Ok, here the review: I can't recommend this game. Alot of stuff in this game is really really cool, like the environment graphics and the lighting or the looks of the spells, but there are sooo many things that should be fixed: 1. you are going to run/ride/click unnecessary often - the transport system feels like they actually want you to waste your time going from point a to point b. It's possible to go directly to points on the map without using a wayshrine, but that costs gold, which I don't understand at all. Forcing players to use those crappy wayshrines that lead to load screens makes the playing experience ridiculous grindy.  Also not having all together, like you are in town and only have to go into a menu to visit different institutions like banks, guild traders, taverns, etc makes the game unnecessary time-consuming. The first 20 hours it may be cool to explore towns, but i am getting really annoyed being forced to manually run to all institutions without the possibility of a shortcut. If they would drop this fee for going directly to points on the map and make towns less tedious the game would be 200% better instantly, especially for players like me that don't want to spend 6 hours everyday on a game only to have a shot at levelling up. At first i wanted to stop here, to i want to explain this detailed, because this annoys me the most: you are in a town, you want to go to a banker, you hit M for map, you find the banker, you walk in front of the bank door, you hit key E, load screen, you are in the bank. Takes up to 4 minutes, just to make a single action in the game.  This should be way, way easier, like: you are in a town, you want to go to a banker, you hit M for map, you click on the bank building on the map, short load screen, bam - you are inside the bank. Takes 2 seconds. Of course this shouldn't be possible if you have stolen or are in a town filled with enemies.  Also I don't understand how there are so many doors and obstacles. Is it really that difficult to implement going through doors without load-screens in 2016? Especially if the room you are going in is like 10 squaremeters with 6 objects and two persons. This is not a clever game design at all.   2. alot of elements in this game are not skill oriented. While the quests aren't bad in any way, i don't like being forced to do them in order to gain more experience than if i had moved freely. That contradicts the open-world character the game has. I find myself just going from person A to person B, clicking alot on the E key and searching on the compass/map for person C, only to get send back to person A, which takes no skill, just the ability to stay awake. This is what you seem to get the most experience points from.  3. the controls could be improved. The map could be an overlay instead of covering my screen. Inventory should be searchable and sortable, also grid view without installing addons would be nice. Climbing and diving are practically impossible. Funny to imagine that our hero isn't able to climb over a 3 meter wall or get on a dock which is 1 meter over the water. Again, alot of unnecessary wasted time for the player just to get from point a to point b in a lot of situations.  4. pay-to-win or grind-to-win are the only options. If you buy the basic game, you are basically getting ripped off, because sooner or later you are going to pay for the ESO-plus membership, because of stuff like crafting bags, horses, DLCs and so on. I don't think a monthly subscription is bad at all and i don't think buying expansions is bad at all, but putting players that just have the basic game into a drastic disadvantage to those who have bought the imperial edition or have the eso-plus is not right in my opinion. They shouldn't sell the basic game at all, to make it fair. If you buy the basic game, you will want to buy either a dlc or the subscription sooner or later, if you take it serious. I think there are games out there that give you alot more bang for your buck than ESO. The way the pricing is and the way they try to make money off the players makes me personally mistrust the developers.",

I play as a caster in most mmo but in ESO it feels like magic got the short end of the stick.

My time with free weekend as of 11-17-2016 to 11- 11-21-2016 with ESO, so how does ESO compare to say Skyrim? Beside the environments and lore’s the gameplay is like Gothic with muilt-player.

With this MP feature I just feel as if random ppl would come into my Skyrim and KSing on everything I do, from killing to farming mats ppl would get in your face and take it from you. However, ppl do come to your aid when you about to be over-run or dying but then again ppl will KS on everything that can be touch or not nailed down.  Now let’s talk about the classes, it’s not impressive as you might think in ESO anyway, due the fact that any classes can use any weapon which allow some flexibility. What I mean is that every weapon has built-in skills for example Healing Staff which will allow you to learn healing skills which any class can use; so technically any class can heal/ DD or even tanking. Sure you can be in heavy armor assassin and be a healer too but don’t be thinking you can cast fire balls or healing spell while you’re dual sword combo with either. What I mean is you got to have a Destruction Staff equipped before you can cast those atk spells or a healing staff to heal unless your class skill have healing. While the classes have 3 different skill trees to choose but it feel just a bit of mixture of cc, healing, or DD skills, however, since you limited to the 5 active keys even after you reach lvl 15 which allow a 2nd bar it’s not enough to put 3 trees and your weapon skills on 10 slots. Again it feels limiting and with this limits it’s more compelling to be a melee-er over a caster IMO. No matter how you mix and match your setup, your setup will feel or looks all the same at end game or at least not as unique as ESO want you to believe.  Since ESO is a mmo technically so it cannot be mod like Skyrim, Bethesda or rather Zenimax got too greedy with how the overall game design is. With those microtansaction and SUB is just made the game looks and feeling cheap unless you pony up, sure you don’t have to but with all that stuffs in the Cash Shop they are really hinting on you to spend more than you need to. Like Black Desert Online if you don’t pay you will feel and or looking like a poor bum than a high class noble folks at end game.   In conclusion the last question would be, is it worth the money to play ESO? To me personally it’s just an OK game with what seem to be a huge map or maps to go around and doing stuff in but it’s just a lot of smaller maps or zone-ing from map to map, even if those are still newbie island it still not all that impressive if all you do is questing or collecting mats later on. Not to say questing in ESO is not fun just that if you not questing then there is little to do for players that aren’t into questing. JUST like every damn dumb ♥♥♥ mmo limiting the fun on limiting your inventory space which to me just kills most of the fun in any game. NO ONES that I know of like to run back to town every 10mins to clear up inventory space and with crafting and the zillion of food/pots/drinks/mats/gears it’s always a bad idea with LIMITING inventory space IMO. I personally feel ESO is not worth more than $20 that include everything I mean EVERYTHING, to me everything in the CS should have been IN GAME to start with and not this junk CASH Shop, IMO.  So they are expecting us to spending a lot of money just on bag space alone, oddly some ppl thinking THAT is ok. It’s kinda like buying a NEW car but you have to buy the 4 wheels separately and that is acceptable? My playtime probably not enough to cover everything in ESO but after 70 hours I think I have enough to know what will be waiting for me. Unlike Skyrim or Fallout you really don’t have much to do other than questing/grinding for skill up/or farming for mats but the problem is not the grinding or questing but how far all those things in between. I feel the POI (Point of Interest) are pretty much a one-time deal, after you done with that POI then nothing else to do after that but to move to the next area/map not even worth back tracking for loot so I feel that’s a damn waste of map and POI, it wouldn’t kill them to give a few repeatable quests for those maps and the lack of Dungeons or Cave make exploration in ESO also a one time in lot of areas get it “in lot of areas.” Ahem any rate, ESO is pretty much design for ppl that’s going from A-B-C and never look back again kind of gameplay in other word, on rail mmorpg? What makes Skyrim or Fallout series so special is that ability to play and go or do anything in any order, its literally free how you want to play or how cool you can look while doing anything (power of mods need I say more).   Final thoughts; if I have to give points I would give ESO a 6 out of 10 and if I could get most things in CS ESO’s for say $10 then I would give it an 8/10. I feel ESO will get boring in 2 weeks tops, not to say I don’t enjoy playing it just feels that way. Anyone plays Skyrim and Fallout had already bath in the bliss of free open-end gaming world which most ppl nowadays are going for. Not this on rail gaming of the past and a dying lot if I may be so bold. I would think for $30 Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen would give more ban for the buck fun IMO than $30 pop for gold version of ESO and that’s not including everything. If Dragon’s Dogma goes on sales even bigger BAN and for the obvious, but Dragon's Dogma is not a mmo nor the same type and I will say but for the same price is what I’m comparing at and the amount of playtime it offers, and yes I do own Dragon's Dogma on ps3 and maybe pc too.  For all intended and purpose for some, spending $10 or $30 on a new Elder Scroll games is pretty cheap then by all means go for it but for everyone else there are other choices. I hope my views help someone on making a wiser choice. Oh one last thing on there store page it said ;  ' The purchase of a Tamriel Unlimited or Gold Edition game cannot be combined with any existing Elder Scrolls Online account and must be accessed separately through the Steam client. '  Does that mean if I play 'Unlimited' on free weeken and if I buy gold I would have to START OVER?",

            "review_text": "I played the BETA of TESO and thought of course that it was horrible and totally forgot about this game. Then, a few months ago, I heard there was a 'new' version, Tamriel Unlimited, and that it no longer required subscription (like it happened to every other MMOs). Apparently, this version is supposed to be the good one, what it should have been in the beginning, I kept reading that the bad reviews were before Tamriel Unlimited and that it was now a very goog game. Well let me say right now that it's not true at all !  When I saw it on sale last week end, I thought i'd try that 'game that used to be bad but now is good'. First piece of disapointment, after more than 7 hours download, I launch the game only to realize it had another 7+ hours download of updates to do, wtf ? Couldn't you just put it all in the first download so we're not tricked into thinking we're going to be able to play the first day after purchase ? Anyway, 15 hours of download later, at 3 in the morning I finally get to start the game. The intro cinematic is very good, the main menu music gets me excited to play, I click on create a character and... thats' it ? I mean, I can be a little fat, or have a little more muscles and choose between 3 differents beards and hair, nothing more ? There's a tremendous lack of customization there and that's odd cause I feel like it seems better in the beta, I guess I just played a lot of better games since then and it can't suffer the comparison. And don't get me started on the character creation UI ! It's a f***** slide, you don't have any preview nor name to help you know what you're clicking on. Guild Wars 2 too lacks a lot of variation in it's character creation menu but at least you preview what you're clicking on, here there's nothing ! Ok, so, now that I got a character that doesn't look anything like I would've liked him too, let's start playing. I rush through the introduction area cause it has not changed since Beta. Actually, yes it has, you used to be able to choose a weapon there, now I don't get that choice, I'm stuck with the 2 handed sword the woman whose name I'll never remember gave me ! I finally get to my character's starting area and I must say the art is very well done. I chose a khajiit and their architecture is burma and china inspired but with it's own original feel, it's very good. The graphics, on the other hand, feel pretty dull, like a console game. So I go to the graphic menu only to realize I'm already on the higher settings. Hell, Skyrim is way better looking than that with graphic mods that are years older. Clearly the game has been downgraded so f**** consoles could run it without their players feeling swindled.  Let's talk about the gameplay now. There's a lot of things to say, like the fact that you have to stop pressing any movement key when you want to open a door otherwise you could press open as much as you want it just won't. It seems stupid like that but it gets annoying very quickly. The jumping system too is stupid, once in the air, you don't get to direct your character just a little like in any other games, you're stuck. So if you've made a mistake, you just wait and watch him fall down... I haven't seen such a bad jumping system since Star Wars: The Old Republic ! Your character is very slow and doesn't have any speed boost besides sprinting which then prevents him to fight, everything is designed so you need to buy a horse as soon as you can. The lowest tier ♥♥♥♥♥♥ horse costs 10 000 gold, it's just HUGE. Just so you realize, I saved 1000 gold in like 5-6 hours. So, in order to buy that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ horse, I need to farm for 60 hours, that means the entire main quest line of the witcher 3, 2 and a hald days of playing in order to start to slightly appreciate the game. Or, of course, you can spend $20 of real money to get the imperial horse... Why is that so important to get a horse ? Because the questing is 10 years late. It's all FedEx missions, go there, kill that, get me that, and then that and then go all the way through the map to get your money or pay 100 gold to fast travel there, FFS ! I read that the quests were the better part of the game but it's not, not at all. Compared to a solo elder scrolls it's way beyond compare but even actual MMOs. It's not dynamic and flexible like in Guild Wars 2, it's not story driven, making you wanna listen to all well-written dialogues like in Star Wars: The Old Republic, you don't feel involve and wanna pay attention to every details like in The Secret World, no ! It's generic and annoying and you end up having a list of 50 FedEx missions in your quest journal like in World of Warcraft ! Let's finish by talking about the combat system. I guess you saw it coming, it's bad ! Well, actually not bad but boring as hell and lacking a lot of diversity and tactics. You end up smashing the attack button again and again, sometimes activating this or that skill but whatever, you don't even need that, you can win any combat just by clicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of the mob as long as you have the required level, there's no depth at all. I won't even talk about the social features and the bad grouping system which requires each player in the group to accomplish the quest objective, even though another player already pressed the button/killed the boss/liberated the slaves, it only works for him. Even when playing alone, you get no immersion whatsoever cause you're surrounded by copycats, all chosen saviors of the world like you, doing the same quests in front of you and stealing your loots, ...  It really has a single-player syndrome; so it's a solo MMO but, like a lot of people said before me, it's neither a good solo game nor a good MMO, it's just very average, not to say bad...  Of course, I don't recommend this game at all, not even for the Elder Scrolls franchise fans, hell especially not for the Elder Scrolls franchise fans ! If you want a good recent AAA solo RPG please go and play The Witcher 3 or Dragon Age Inquisition; if you want a good AAA MMO, please play Guild Wars 2 or The Secret World, but please let this furuncle on the Elder Scrolls franchise's face die slowly, and cross your fingers that Fallout 4 doesn't end up like this !  EDIT : There's so much things I forgot to talk about, like the fact that wearing light or heavy armor doesn't change anything to the sound you make while walking, it breaks immersion if there was any left. There are also bugs like loading screens freezing, forcing you to ALT+F4 the game and launch it again, there's lag between the moment you interract with an NPC and the moment the dialogue window appears, ... I update this review as I stumble upon these things, I'm not a liar as I've been called by some angry fanboys.  By the way, my PC is high end and runs any game on ultra settings, so don't come and say it's my machine, and my internet connexion is excellent too.",

I was able to play a few hours of the game before I found some gamebreaking bugs and ended up giving up and uninstalling the game.   Some pros of the game is that... yeah can't think of anything sorry.   You are thrown into the game and have to go through an open world dungeon where you have to go out and kill some random daedra. I do not mind that... except that that alone took me around 2 hours to do. It is WAY to easy to get lost and have to use guides to make it through THE FIRST AREA. Okay, rewind to character creation. You get to make some pretty detailed characters that can have a unique appearances and they look decently cool. The only problem is that if you want to make a character that will be allied with some random factions, YOU HAVE TO PAY WITH COLD, HARD CASH. I would not even consider this **** to be an Elder Scrolls game. If anything I would consider this to be a standalone game that should be called 'Give me your money: Magic addition.' Okay, some coming back to where you finally get INTO the game... trying to get from one area to another, without a horse, is like trying to move without having arms and legs (fully possible, but you're going to be looking like an idiot). Want a horse? MORE MONEY! Getting cash ingame is another thing that seems to be a grind. Everything ingame is insanely overpriced and makes becoming wealthy newly impossible. You can BUY MONEY though... and armor... and a weapon... So if you want to waste $60.00 than go ahead and buy this game. If I could I would gladly give this game back and get even HALF of my money back, BUT you are not able to do that because the game uses a CD Key that is directly linked to the copy of the game that you own.  May 5, 2016: Decided i would retry the game and see what has changed and been improved on. I can say that it only took me around 3 hours this time to get into the game. After I was on the game I was instantly met with a noticifiction informing me that the game now had DLC. Upon further inspection I realized I would have to buy the game a total of 3 more times if I wished to have EVERY DLC. Or you revert the game back into a subsciption based and receive 'EVERYTHING' for 'FREE.' Also, deciding to go into the chat and question some people I was instantly muted upon saying: 'This game is still a money pit. I'm surprised it's still even somewhat alive.' and by MUTED I mean I was blocked from the chat for 20 minutes. Strange, huh?  No matter, they have my money that I ended up wasting on this game. Have fun if you decide to buy it. I will be back in a year or so to look back into this game again.",

            "review_text": "A one-off payment for a MMORPG is an absolutely great idea, and at a glance I wished more games did it. But admittedly, after playing EDO (I should note I have more in-game hours outside of Steam) I started to wonder if perhaps monthly installments are needed to make a beautiful MMORPG. For someone fussy about graphics and observant of character and world design, I don't think the game is that great. I should note my complaints don't really regard the story, which I do think is relatively good for an online game.  One of the big issues I had with Elder Scrolls Online is that the world didn't feel that immersive or 'real'. For one, I'm not sure what approach Bethesda were trying to take with the graphics: they're almost too blocky to be considered realistic, but I wouldn't call them stylised either. The first time I came across this was with creating elves in the character creator: the body proportions on practically the default settings are anatomically silly. For example the waist, both on male and female character models, is impossibly small: it makes the characters look plain weird (it resembles breaking the body boundaries on The Sims character creator/s) whilst wearing armour, especially so for the female elves. As Skyrim managed to present lithe-bodied elves (the bodies are respectively inhuman, but they don't look anatomically incorrect), I think it's odd that the body-type standards didn't seem to be used for this game.   I also think the character creation was a surprising let-down. Whilst I like that they did include body customisation, as that is a really rare feature for even single-player RPGs, the face customisation is a bit misleading: there are a lot of sliders, but none of them really do any drastic changes. For example, the maximum compared to minimum eye-size on a female wood elf is barely noticable. I was also a bit disappointed that I couldn't recreate the slightly more human face of my male orc from Skyrim, as the character creator does not let you defy the neanderthal-like facial look that they've set for the male orcs. In all I think the game surprisingly restricts you with its character creation, and a lot of characters of the same species don't look that different from one-another, with exception of hairstyles.  Another thing that I spotted quite quickly is the lack of posing/body language in PCs and NPCs, which also adds to making the world feel a bit fake. When I made my character stop running, they would resume a position with their arms just out at their sides: I also noticed a lot of NPCs seemed to just stand blankly, other than occasionally walking about. As a lot of newer MMORPGs now have NPCs or idle PCs that change poses (see FFXIV Online - characters will fold their arms, shift their weight onto one leg and tap their feet when inactive), I thought this was a surprising feature to overlook, and for me it plays a surprising part in making the game look quite a bit older than it actually is. This lack of life to the characters doesn't help when the world itself is actually relatively bland: I have yet to stop and admire any landscape in the game, and I've done this whilst playing free-to-play MMOs before (eg. Age of Wushu). In all I found the setting pretty generic. This can also be said in regards to the game's armour/costumes. Whilst they do improve as their level increases, this admittedly the case with most MMOs, they still appear as almost overly-simplified in terms of design: I was surprised when looking over how beautifully detailed some of the armour appears as concept art, but how much the textures and shapes portrayed in the drawings seem to be lost once adapted into actual in-game wear. It is honestly comparable to the sort of armour you get in a free-to-play MMO, which even if EDO is cheap for a MMO you have to pay for, I think is really disappointing.  So to summarise, I really feel that Elder Scrolls Online lets itself down in terms of its overall look. The world and the armour is just generic, and its inhabitants feel lifeless, with their weird default-position poses and strange models. Whilst many people have been saying to look at this game completely separately from Skyrim, I would still argue that, as a more recent game from Bethesda, I would have expected the game's style and graphics to be a lot more unique and better quality, as they were in Skyrim. Because of this I would find Elder Scrolls Online hard to recommend over a free-to-play MMO.",

I enjoyed Skyrim for it's beautiful landscapes and variety of customization. I felt connected to the AI units in the game. I don't know much about the fighting sequences or controls, but I found them enjoyable and easy to get used to.  With this game; however, as a Dark Elf, I spawned in some barren wasteland with dull landscapes, and 4 hours into the game, I was still stuck at the same regions. I purchased this game knowing this would include all of Tamriel, but to be kept away from Skyrim for so long? Geez! Also, whose bright idea was it to make the in-game text painfully smaller? The fighting, while similar to Skyrim, was a bit lacking. In this game, talking to AI was just a waste of time. I did not know what's going on, who's who, and what the story was. It felt like the game just kept throwing an infinite number of mindless quests my way with a cat's head and a kangaroo's tail forcefully attached to a chihuahua. The levels of customizations weren't too appealing to me either. I had a huge load of gold in the 4 hours I'd played, but it was all in vain as merchants weren't clear enough, neither were raw materials.   As far as the game's stability goes, I hadn't noticed any glitches to be honest, but I did keep getting tossed out of the game. In another game, Team Fortress 2, when my connection drops out or gets laggy, I get stuck. With this game, laggy connection just throws me out entirely.  If you're expecting Skyrim here, don't bother and move on. I don't know if you have a background in MMORPG or whether having that background would make this game more enjoyable, but if you've got an open mind and would be willing to expect anything, please, do try it out.  I just ended up getting a refund. I don't know if I acted too hastily in forming an opinion, but it just wasn't enjoyable enough for me. Who knows, I might end up giving it another shot in the future, but it's a no from me for now.",

Then suddenly you are up against an npc that is nearly impossible. This happened to me with Hazak in Hazak's lair at around level 7. But main reason that happened was...the quest npc that is supposed to help me fight him...does nothing. Yes that's right. After a long boring dialogue where this person asks you to 'help me fight Hazak or I will fight him by myself and probably wind up dying if I try it alone'...he follows me to Hazak, where I begin fighting Hazak...and the npc that asked for your help in fighting him....just stands there with his weapon sheathed, watching as I fight this boss alone with only my crappy low level monkey looking lightning pet, which dies in 2 hits to Hazak, and then I die, as the npc just stands there. Completely turned off to this game now and pretty turned off to Bethesda in general. Maybe instead of trying to have several different titles like Fallout 4 and this at same time, they should focus on one game to make good. Cause this game is broken and barely playable.

Just, like, get your shiz together, ESO. I must've had this installing and uninstalling and reinstalling trying to fix the problem for a good, I don't know, 40 cumulative hours before Dishonored backdoored the solution for me.

Pros:  1) There IS a game. There are quests, Items, Weapons, and Things to do in the game.  2) PvP is regulated. A level ten can beat a Veteran Rank 14 Player. The only thing stopping him is if the VR14 player's gear is better than his, and it usually is.  Cons:  1) The quests are boring, and tend to be very similiar to eachother.  2) The sixty dollar price tag is incredibly expensive due to the fact that, one, the game is no longer new, and two, if you want to have any fun with your game, you are going to have to spend at least $30 bucks in microtransactions to aquire the items neccesary to progress through the game.  3) The player base is so little for a MMO, that there is almost no reason to try to start your own guild, or pay any attention to online features, because they probably won't be used, or be used so little, that they won't positively effect your experience. The people who ARE on, usually are on because they spent $60 bucks on a bad game, and don't want their money to be wasted, so they play the game until about level 10, which you can reach in about 2-3 hours.

I'm way over paying 60 bucks to play geek squad on some ♥♥♥♥ game. Ive you the money, you give me a working product period. 0/10 want a refund. inb4 fanboy responses. unless there is a patch to fix this im not interested in what you have to say. Buyer beware of this product. even if you manage to somehow make it past the technical issues the game it self is extremely meh.",

I can also go anywhere in the game straight away?? and all the mobs anywhere i go are my lvl so i can kill them????  WHO THE HELL THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?????  So now im 10 hours in and bored to tears but I can't get a refund from steam because i've played more than 2 hours...

I would rather deal with armored bikini. What is the target audience for this game?  Every badass or powerful NPC in this game is a woman. Leader of the fighers guild? A woman Leader of the mages guield? A woman Leader of the undaunted (or whatever its called)? A woman Every ♥♥♥♥ing orc chieftain? Female Every friggin human oficer? ♥♥♥♥ing girls (and i mean every single one without any exceptions) Every captain of every ship? All women. Even in the tutorial you are led by a girl  The quest where you have to save Wyrd tree - every cultist is a woman btw. They give you a quest to save 6 villagers: 1 badass khadjitess that killed an imp with her bare hands, a female lumberjack that stands on top of pile of corpses, 2 girl mages that casted a ward around themselves, and 2 cowards males that are found behind the boxes beggin to save them. This is just one example. The pattern repeats itself in every quest. Men are either idiots or cowarsd or traitors. Women are all badass and smart (and there are 10 women for every dude)",
