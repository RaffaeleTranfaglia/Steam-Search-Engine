            "review_text": "long story short, THIS GAME IS VERY GOOD. This a game has no story but still manages to explain it well with its other world feature, I feel like this game is a lot like portal. However an issue that is happening with me is that when im in world 1 ( The one with rain) my frame rates drop. like a twelve year olds balls this makes it very hard to play. But when I'm in the second world the FPS goes up like the Amarica to Canada immigration rates after Donald Trump. I do play this game on OSX if that helps fix this issue. Thank you.",
