            "review_text": "Odallus: The Dark Call a game which has that 8-bit nostalgia we all love and gameplay that is very addicting as well as challenging. I myself died plently of times to the zone bosses but kept on fighting until I won. This is one of the elements that Odallus: The Dark Call shines in. The game forces you to learn the bosses attack patterns and not just spam the attack key and expect to win. I enjoy this feature because there are to many games that make boss fights easy and bland. Plus there is no better feeling then finally killing the boss that was preventing you from progressing. Ahh it feels like im playing Castlevania on the NES as a kid again. Odallus: The Dark Call is a gem of a game.",

            "review_text": " The Good:    Graphically, the game has best picking of the 8-bit palette.   The Music has the proper helping of 8-bit deets and doots.   The dark atmosphere helps convey the overall desolation of the story.    The Neutral:   (See Below for reasons)    The Controls are decent, but at times feel way too rigid and sometimes unresponsive.    The Bad:   (See Below for reasons)    Final Boss. 'nuf said.    Comments:   I personally love me a good 8-bit Castlevania, even more so when it absorbed Metroid into its amorphous gelatinous mass. So I have no problem saying that 'Odallus: The Dark Call' is a decent throwback to that entire genre. I won't spoil anything regarding the gameplay, as it's largely self-explanatory from the start if you've played Castlevania or Metroid (If not, why not?). However, there is one gripe I have with the game and that's the spike in difficulty right at the end.  So I've nearly beaten 'Odallus' and have collected everything in the game, but that final hurdle is quite a doozy. Anyway, the fight begins with a largely equal opponent, being able to deflect attacks and special weapons is his main attraction. Basically, the player has to bait out his attacks to deal damage, which wasn't really needed in the entirety of the game up to this point but I guess that's the final bosses charm. However, his attacks are erratic and without a set pattern when they are baited out, sometimes he'll do a three-hit combo and other times just a single strike all of which throw you across the screen, go through any invincibility you may have, and take a heart each. All of this is manageable, but it's rather jarring since it hasn't come up until now.  Once that fight is done there's a little talking time, and then begins phase two which is step up the intensity scale. Your foe gets a slew of new attacks, in which he has more mobility, has projectiles, and an invincible super move along with his attacks in phase one. It's about here when I noticed that it was a lack of detail on the controls, sometimes I'd need to use the dash to get out of a situation and it wouldn't respond. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but in the final fight it can result in some serious life complications (mostly with the life part).  I haven't even reached the third stage of the fight yet, but that's largely because the first two phases are a seriously long, drawn out affair. However, beyond that little spike near the end, the game is largely quite tame and can be played at a decent pace. 'Odallus' is a decent challenge for those looking for an old school Castlevania-esque adventure, so I will recommend it even if it has that difficulty spike.",

            "review_text": "Indie games on Steam claiming to be inspired by the classics and not living up to it is pretty much old hat at this point. So I wouldn't exactly blame anyone for reading Odallus' store description and giving it a pass - but if they did, they'd be missing out on a modern classic. Odallus definitely lives up to all three of those series, and is proof you can still make games like them.   JoyMasher's last game, Oniken (which I would also gladly recommend), was inspired in large part by Fist of the North Star, and Odallus has its own 80s manga inspiration in Berserk, which you can see in a lot of the enemy designs and some story ideas. You play as Haggis, a soldier-turned-hunter who returns to his village one night to find it ablaze, as a local lord has invaded, killed almost everyone, and kidnapped his son. What's worse, people are transforming into demons. It's definitely dark fantasy, which gives it a unique flair compared to Castlevania and Ghouls and Ghost (though not quite Demon's Crest).  Gameplay-wise, Haggis has his sword, which has a decent amount of range, as well as three sub-weapons: an axe that goes straight, a torch that goes downward and causes a fire for sustained damage, and a spear that flies up in an arc. They're all useful in their own right and can help you out a lot against certain enemies. Haggis also feels very tight to control, and while there are some tricky jumps it never felt like the game was unreasonable at all. The game's bosses also all pose a threat, but are fair about it.  Odallus also has some Metroidvania elements to it, as the game's Ghouls and Ghosts map contains several bonus levels you won't be able to access immediately, and every level has things you'll need the ability to push big blocks or glide to get to. It also lets you save and head back to the map whenever you want, meaning you don't need to go through the whole level again just to find whatever you're looking for. I beat the game in about five hours, but there is an extra difficulty mode that I hear changes things up a lot. All in all, if you're jonesing for some new Castlevania stuff, Odallus could tide you over quite nicely before Bloodstained is finished.",

If you like Castlevania games and SNES type of graphics and gameplay you need to buy this.   Game is difficult no doubt, but not unfair. They have mitigated difficulty in a nice way: even if you get game over your progress in that level stays if you have opened doors, activated shortcuts, or beaten midbosses. Therefore it doesn't feel frustrating grind as with some other platformers when you do fail.  The story is nothing to write home about, but it's pretty same level as these types of games usually have. No one plays these for story, right? Cutscenes were well done though.  You choose your level and progression path to some extent along with backtracking and secret hoarding. It really adds to the game and it's fun to build your character Haggis stronger.  There are few bugs in the game but nothing game breaking. Missing inputs from gamepad are the most annoying, but fortunately very rare.  4.7/5",

You must find secrets and upgrades in many distinct stages that are all well designed. The grotesque creatures and boss you are fighting bring back memories of Castlevania. Unlike Metroidvania-type game it's devided in stages and you are not exploring a continuous world, much like Demon Crest on SNES.  The game look great for it's graphical choice and, most important, it control perfectly well. The game's not that difficult, but it's no cakewalk either, especially once you reach the final boss.

Odallus is a fantastic homage to the great action adventure games of yesteryear, combining elements from Castlevania, Gargoyle's Quest, Astynax, and Metroid. It blends sword-swinging action with careful platforming exploration, all within a darkly grim fantasy world.  The graphics are gorgeous, the music (while subdued) fits the atmosphere perfectly, and the story is engaging enough to want to see to the end. And the gameplay, of course, provides more than enough challenge for those new to the genre and even for those who grew up with it (like myself.) It was just easy enough that I was able to progress at a moderate pace, but just difficult enough that I felt I got my money's worth.  If I have a gripe about the game, it's the dialogue: whether intentional or not, the erratic Engrish took me out of the experience at times. I hope it's something they fix in the future.  But if a few grammatical mistakes are the only complaints I have with the game, that's quite alright by me. I cannot stress enough how amazing this game is. Buy it.",

Its hard but fair ( practice will be required to get past anything other than the first level most likely ) Gameplay is simple but has a ton of variety with its level design. ( plus its always nice to play a game that doesnt need a long tutorial to play, just get into the game and learn. ) Despite its intentional technological limitation to look like an old game, it has a ton of detail to the enviroments and story scequences using its old graphics techniques to their fullest ( the old NES would of never been able to play this game as it is ). If you have the love for old school game play and old school graphics ( that are very well done ) you should give this game a play imo",

            "review_text": "Odallus: The Dark Call is an action filled, throwback styled, adventure platformer that stands on it's own despite endless comparisons to the games of yesteryear.   The superficial stuff here is extremely polished. The art alone gets Odallus much deserved attention and praise. I found the sounds and music above average as well. Granted there are a great many indie games with fantastic throwback art and sound styles. But Odallus also delivers at it's core mechanics. The controls are extremely polished and tight. So smooth in fact I didn't even find myself lamenting the atrocious 360 d-pad because I was able to use the thumbstick fine! speaking of, I would say a controller is heavily recommended here. It is easy to pick up and play but worth the effort to master. The simple story kept my attention from the standard beginnings to the gruesome ends. The level design is truly top notch and each world is varied and worth the time to explore completely for the abundant secrets. Nothing is impossibly hidden or unfairly set up for memorization and perfection. This is a nice open platforming adventure that rewards you for taking the scenic route. I 100%'d the in game check markers on the default difficulty and came away with 7 solid hours of sloppy play.  What starts as perceived difficulty does give way to your growing boldness once you get more of a feel for it. I polished off more than one boss with my better equipment and pure attack spam. And while I don't see how you would make things more difficult without taking away continues or making things unfair, I do think the challenge ends up in the medium range for the game style. I could hardly count this against the game as there is a higher difficulty as well as achievement challenges that I admittedly won't be doing. So in the end it was the right difficulty for me, but the more self described hardcore might have to work harder for a challenge. It is a good step above casual though.  Another thing with this game is the comparisons it gets to the Old Gods of gaming. The recommended/positive reviews are ripe with comparisons to games but with little accolades for what Odallus does on it's own. I would actually stop short of calling this a 'Metroid-vania', particularly the latter part. It draws the heaviest from those two franchises but there is plenty more inspiration as well. I felt a little of everything from Mega Man to Donkey Kong Country in there! Highlander and Blade Runner (the movies) aren't afraid to show up either. And to go even deeper with apples and oranges nonsense, the entire time I was enjoying this I was thinking 'Man, this is everything Volgarr the Viking wasn't for me'... But. All of this is unfair. This game stands on it's own despite it's clear inspirations. While it'd be at home on a cartridge it brings new styles, enemies, and ideas. Notably that wonderful use of the widescreen format for inventory and information that most throwback games would insist throwing in a pause menu. Odallus: The Dark Call is it's own beast and deserves judgement on it's own. Including the praise.   It has begun to find it's way into bundles and steep sales which as always is where the true value is. $14.99 USD is a bit rich for my blood but I wouldn't have been entirely upset had I spent that.

The first thing you'll notice is that the game is very beautiful; the dreamy pastel pixels that comprise the game world would be right at home in an experimental late NES game, and the developers have even gone to the trouble of restricting colors used per sprite in order to give the assets a more authentic vibe! It's some of the finest pixel art you'll ever see in a game! (The music is good too, but it is not nearly as notable as the artwork.)  There is no lag or floatiness in the controls; you are solely responsible for your mistakes here, which is okay because the game isn't terribly difficult. The last boss poses a suitably epic challenge, though, and the rest of the game is a great deal of fun even if it doesn't induce you to curse your own birth.  Odallus  is a bit like  Rondo of Blood  in that it features gigantic, sprawling levels that remain discrete -- it never takes that final turn into the labyrinthine world of the metroidvania. Consequently, you won't be lost if you take a lot of time between play sessions.  I have but one complaint: some of the English is pretty bad. With everything else  Odallus  has going for it, I don't suppose that's much of a big deal, but I found it pretty jarring (most of the runic story slabs border on incomprehensible).

Or maybe you have always loved a good side-scrolling challenge with a retro twist… Odallus is calling your name. It’s kind of a dark calling, but it’s there saying hi.  Odallus starts you out on a hunt when you notice something is amiss back at home. You know how it goes though. You see some smoke at your village and you run back as fast as you can, but no matter what you do, it’s always mostly gone before you arrive and all you can do is dig through the rubble. You find out that some cult of weirdos is behind it and they’ve got your kid to boot! There’s only one thing a man with the name of Haggis can do (yes, his name is Haggis and yes it grows on you): grab your sword and go share it with some evil creatures. Well, that’s a start at least right?  The developers really went out of their way to make Odallus aesthetically old school. Odallus really looks like an 8-bit game. The way the character moves, jumps and attacks all take me back. There is obviously additions to the classic formula like weapon variety combined with the ability to switch between them and lack of pixel jumping like when a cartridge gets old or the system needs cleaning. Some things you can just leave out when you go for this genre though. There is also some secret paths that will have you coming back to the beginning of the game to find the areas with hidden power-ups or different paths to lead you through another way to get to the end.  The difficulty is probably the main thing that will grab people’s attention and get them to come over to the Odallus side in the first place. (That’s just a big thing currently.) I don’t feel it’s your usual difficulty that some Indie devs have been going for lately. A lot of the time it’s a speed or overabundance of enemies/bullets/spikes that will overwhelm you in most recent “hardcore” sidescrollers. JoyMasher hit the nail on the head with the legitimate retro feel. Odallus’ difficulty seems to be based on your level of patience. Nothing will jump out of a spot that wasn’t there before or what-have-you or force you to move your fingers way faster than you may be able to. It’s a classic “slow and steady wins the race”. When you start getting frustrated and rush into things is when you’ll die. Calm down and take your time and measure your enemies (bosses included). There’s no time limit (thank goodness) so you have no reason to speedrun Odallus… unless that’s your goal. If that’s the case then, hurry up man! There is an achievement after all.  Score: Gewd/Tasty!  I haven’t run into many issues with Odallus: The Dark Call after the few patches they put out a little after I initially downloaded the game and before it officially launched. Since then it’s been smooth sailing and I’ve really enjoyed myself. That, of course, is only because I’ve learned to walk away after a few deaths on the same area. When I get too frustrated I tend to just walk away for a very long time. With a myriad of level types and the ability to obtain new weapons (and suck at using all of them other than the sword) there’s actually a lot to experience here. There are puzzles, platforming and stabbing stuff all while pulling off the retro feel better than most, Odallus is pretty dang good. That’s coming from a guy who doesn’t appreciate too much of a challenge anymore either (I’m getting old and just want to have fun, get off my back!) If you’re looking for a nostalgia trip, a retro-themed game, or just a game that won’t let you be too mindless, Odallus will satisfy your hunger. Now, go save your kid!",

I see a lot of comparisons to CastleVania and Shovel Knight, but I struggle to see the similarities. Odallus is the type of game that looks better on paper (or in screen shots) than it performs in practice.  First and foremost, if you are expecting a metroidvania style game, this is not it. Yes, the game does have back tracking, but it is not connected in one large world, it is hard segmented into different specific levels. This game is more similar to Demon's Crest for the Super Nintendo, which is not a bad thing, but please be aware of what you are getting.  Perhaps the most critical weakness of Odallus lies within the core gameplay mechanics. It wants to be a tightly controlled NES style platformer, but it does not live up to this expectation. The controls are very responsive, and in fact feel great at first. As you progress you will however notice that the hit detection leaves something to be desired as your character is honestly, just too large. The scale of the game does not work for the type of tight manuevering and platforming that the game expects. It's certainly not the worst I have experienced, but it could be much much better.  Onto the 2nd downfall, the music. Just take a look at this game. It deserves an inspired, gritty, hard cut NES synth style soundtrack. Unfortuantely the developer had a different vision. Outside of perhaps the first level, the music really has more of a dull and moody vibe. The tracks generally fail to pop out and give that punchy memorable vibe you know so well from titles like CastleVania.  Luckily, despite other drawbacks, Odallus is beautiful. The art is wonderfully detailed and converys a very dark and sinistar overtone throughout the game. If Odallus has one strong point, this is it, hand down. Unfortunately, this is also what makes the game rather misleading when basing your purchasing decision solely from screen shots.  Overall, I'd say the issue with Odallus is simply that...it's boring. I never felt excited about the levels, the music never got me pumped, the gameplay isn't refined enough to keep me coming back. It's a dull muddy experience that is carried by some excellent art direction. If you are going to buy this game, I recommend that you watch some videos of the gameplay first. 15 dollars is too steep, but at about 5, I'd say it's right where it needs to be. Regardless, I am not going to recommend this game as it fell short of delivering a memorable and fun experience, time could be better spent discovering old NES classics you have never played, or replaying the good ones you already know.

            "review_text": "Don't let the Demon's Crest name drop fool you, this is 8-bit difficulty at its most fickle, which pairs poorly with an old school lives system. Though to its credit, you aren't forced to enter a lengthy password afterward.  The controlls are only marginally less stiff than those of the 8-bit Castlevania games, from which this Odallus is primarily derived. Seriously, do not play this game if you don't like the way the old Castlevania games handled. You even fly backward when you take damage. And yes, there will be water hazards.  Odallus is in need of a quality-of-life patch. I found a menu which can only be exited by scrolling to the bottom of a list, the stage select and 'begin stage' functionalities are accessed separately; all things which would have been mildly grating even in the '80s. And to the horror of the TotalBiscuits of the world, the options menu is sparse, and only accessible before the game actually launches.  Technical problems and bugs: Odallus is picky about controllers. I ended up using an old SNES controller piped through a USB adapter. If you die during a boss fight, you'll occasionally end up with both the boss music and the stage music playing simultaneously. And after the second boss fight, I had to faff around to get the game to accept character input again - I found entering and exiting the start menu worked most reliably. It's worth noting that I began playing in windowed mode after suspecting the game didn't handle alt+tabbing well - some of these bugs may be attributable to that.  I appreciate what they were trying to do - believe me, I do - but this one's a bit low on playability.",
