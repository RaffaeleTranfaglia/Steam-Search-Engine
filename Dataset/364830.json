I am getting the DLC of the sound track because it's so good! The graphics are decent but the gameplay and music make up for it. The world is huge with tons to explore. I can't wait to beat the game. For 8$? What else would you want! 10/10",

I would HIGHLY suggest anyone who hasn't already bought it shouldn't look any further for something new to play.",
