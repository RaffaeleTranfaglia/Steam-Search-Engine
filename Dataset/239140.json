            "review_text": "Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;  - Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.  - One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.  - Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.  - The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.  - Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run around, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.  - Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam, you'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!  - Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.  - Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.  - Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.  - Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!  TL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.",

Music- 10/10 I really enjoyed the whole soundtrack. I even found myself hanging out in old town with the guy blaring a local radio station during my down time in between quests.   Story- 9/10 Mildly predictable, but it's kind of hard to find something that hasn't been done nowadays so I'm pretty forgiving of this. I enjoyed the story regardless of the zombie genre being a bit overdone.  Dialogue- 7/10 Love most of it(especially Stavi), sometimes I wanted to punch Rahid/Jade in the teeth though. Something about their characters just irritated the hell out of me everytime I had to deal with them.  Visuals- 9/10 Very Solid, not groundbreaking, still looks pretty on low settings! :)  Replayability- 7/10 Decent. Plenty of DLC if you're into that sort of thing. It keeps you busy and gives you something new to do for a while but I can see it getting repetitive.  ",

As i'm writing these words, the community of Dying Light is full of cheaters who use modded weapons builded by few hackers and duplicated ingame by who know how to use glitches... and everyone know or can easily learn how to do it. The first times you play, you'll meet many players who will give you weapons for free, automatic crossbows, gold weapons... All these will ruin your solo experience. There is no need to be overpowered to enjoy the Dying Light solo game. The skill tree is, in my opinion, very well balanced for that. Cheating will ruins the fun. I have more than 800h of gameplay, finished 4-5 times the game solo and then played PvP. I played with modded weapons and reached final human PvP rank. Then i replayed again &amp; again without these modded weapons, with all legit stuff, for more fun, based only on my skills... and reached final human PvP rank again, of course. And it's really more fun!  Even if hunter uses glitches to move faster, counterattack when not allowed, Dying Light is a game of  CHALLENGE ! Challenge yourself in solo session with legit gameplay, challenge others without modded weapons, challenge cheaters by showing them they still can loose.",

            "review_text": "So I just got the season pass to get The Folllowing and the other new DLC today. I loved the original game, me and my boyfriend are currently in a two person game.This is a normal difficulty game. Currently we're still in the slums (back tracking for sidequests) We discovered first off, you run a TON faster, it's almost like you have a natural speed boost, just without the stamina boost to match. We've also discovered that if you're in different outfits your character moves slightly different when standing still. The Ninja has a tigher, smaller posture, like you're ready to bolt off the nearest building and end up 3 blocks away. The Urban Explorer makes you look angrier, darker and well... angry just fits his tone to the character. (Yes, we're the kind of nerds to notice the random crap like this xD)    Also, GRAPHICS, HOLY CRAP GRAPHICS! It's smoother, cleaner, prettier, the weather system REALLY shows. you can see individual rain drops hitting the ground/buildings/assorted random objects, the wind is cleaner, very realistic, the wind rustling through the trees matches beautifully. The runners have an upgraded programming that makes them more intelligent (to a degree in terms of where they can climb) and... they seem faster and more aggressive. Alright... tried night mode, and whoever is in charge really needs to evict the new neighbors... They're quiet rude. It's changed a bit, the night stalkers are faster, meaner, deal more damage, come in larger numbers, summon larger hoards of volatiles and have gotten uglier. Not to mention, they're much harder to kill... I got stupidly lucky and managed to kill one from the back with 2 shots from the Golden Double Barrel but that seemed to have been a fluke and it took 10 shots for the next one. You either find the sweet spot, or you run out of ammo trying to find it. Make sure you're stocked up on night vision boosters, not being able to see now can be a death sentence when before it was just a minor annoyance to accidentally fall off a building.    The merchants now have pictures of every item they have for sale, so if you're looking at buying a katana you can see what it looks like. The new guns, we've so far found a golden double barrel shotgun (2550 damage) that will happily take out small groups of zombies, only downside is it only has 2 shots per load, so it's a slower weapon but the damage and destruction it causes are so worth it. Just as a side note on the shotgun... When you get this weapon, find a group of like 20+ zombies and just start shooting into the crowd, the reload is so fast if you're far enough away (about 20 or so meters) none of them can get you and you turn the entire street into jelly. The gun my boyfriend got is the Advanced Military Rifle (274 damage) which is replacing his Camo Military Rifle (137 damage) he can't stop raving about the damage increase and how it seems more accurate from the hip while moving. The Golden German Pistol (331 damage) similar accuracy and handling to the original German pistol but with more damage and a bit more accurate. Reload is similar to the regular German Pistol. The Engraved Semi-Auto Shotgun (2550 damage) rapid fire compared to the Golden (8 shots vs. 2 for Golden) not as good as the Golden Double Barrel it seems as there's a definite accuracy difference between the Golden and Engraved, Engraved having a slower reload time. But overall the shotgun has had some MAJOR improvements and will definitely be used more than it was in the original game where you could be 2 meters away and still miss the zombie... The Advanced Police Rifle (368 damage) basically the sniper rifle for Dying Light (at least so far without testing the crossbow yet) watched my boyfriend pull off a ~75m headshot on a zombie. Two shots to kill a runner, the handling when sniping 'is sweet' (his words haha) but if you've got something up in your face it's just like the old police rifle but with more damage, awkward and misses some times. So far, if you find a gold colored weapon, it'll most likely just become your new best friend.  (Note: None of these weapons have been upgraded or adjusted in anyway via weapon upgrades)     It was a bit of a shock to see the bow AND arrows for sale at any shop when we still haven't completed BOZAK, but.... they still suck for damage, accuracy, fire rate... it's a nice novelty weapon but otherwise... meh. Looking forward to finding the crossbow. As for the zombies, the overall intelligence and aggressiveness of them seems to have been overall increased, nothing too crazy like 'oh-my-god-I-ran-into-a-group-of-5-or-more-zombies-and-died-instantly' more like their 'eyesight' got better and the crowds are larger, a LOT larger.... Random note, discovered you can put dents in the roofs of cars, chop down stop signs, do basic vandalism and the like.",

I really enjoyed dead isalnd as a Zombie game before this and played L4D but never had this much fun especially in multiplayer which this game has done very well on.  Single Player is fun especially if you like following storylines but multiplayer is AWESOME as you can just mess around and have plenty of fun too.  I got my copy of this for a really good deal and helped my brothers both get the game too but probably would not have paid the retail price for it. I do think many people would find it worth the $60 and if you can get it any cheaper like $40-50 it is definetly worth the money if you even slightly enjoy zombie games.",

            "review_text": "Excellent game. It has replay value and will take some time to finish.  The story and protagonist can be a little cheesy and predictable at times, but it's certainly not bad overall. The game is lots of fun and is visually pleasing. 8/10 and worth it. The developers put a lot of effort into this game. Below is a more detailed review of the pros and cons.  Pros: - Zombies: Lots of zombies that get tougher as you get stronger. Until later levels, you will always be wary of the threat a horde of zombies can pose. - Story: there's a story here. Yay! It's not the deepest, but it will keep you motivated to keep going. - Characters: there are a variety of characters with their own quirks in the game. - Missions: lots of side missions encouraging you to explore the map of Harran. The map is vast and while it can take time to get from A to B, you will find it's actually fun to take a detour to get to the airdrop before the bad guys can. - Gameplay: parkour to the core. There is a grappling hook that can help you get around, but leaping from rooftop to rooftop, kicking zombies off high places (THIS IS HARRAN!!!!) and dodging attacks is quite satisfying. You always have to be aware of your surroundings so you can escape or use it to your advantage. - Level up!: You have three main skills: Agility, Strength and Survivor. There is a fourth one (Legend...wait for it...dary!) that unlocks when you max one of the others out. They help you slay zombies faster, dodge attacks, run longer, climb faster, regen health and generally be a better parkour badass. You can even be more stealthy by using zombie guts to camouflage yourself and take the zombies out one-by-one without alerting the horde. - Crafting: Yes, you get to make your own melee weapons and augment them with different elemental effects. Who knew a battery and some power cables could electrocute zombies to death...  Cons: - Optimisation: The original game wasn't as bad, but after the Enhanced Edition update, my GTX970 and core i7 2600 seem to be taking strain. When there are lots of zombies on the screen, even with everything set to its lowest, I expect the FPS to drop below 60, and it does. The game performs poorly on linux, so I had to install it on windows to be able to play it. - Some glitches. The zombies sometimes stay stuck in a mannequin-like pose and don't attack for a bit. They're easy to kill, so I shouldn't complain, but stationary zombies are not undead. They're just dead. - Skills: even though you can max out the skills, you'll find your strength skill shooting up quickly while agility is lagging a bit. Expect to be able to carve through hordes while running short of breath when trying to beat Rais's men to the air drop. Secondly, not all skills are valuable and you have no choice but to invest in a skill under a specific tree when you level up. There is no levelling up a skill, such as camouflage, to level 5 so you have to invest the next point in something you may never use. This creates characters that are all the same when all levels are maxed out. - Being bitten: pretty early on in the game, you're bitten by a zombie which means you need Antizin to stop from turning. Problem is, your character never actually 'needs' Antizin until crucial, scripted moments when he gets seizures. For some reason he never thinks to bring any antizin along while he is swinging around the city. You go from being Spiderman's zombie slaying clone, swinging from building to building, carving zombies in two to suddenly unable to effectively swing your weapon because 'plot'. It is frustrating investing in all those skills but never being able to use them when the story main storyline demands it. - The Following: Enhanced Edition is a little pricey.  Cons aside, it's definitely a decent game. Grab it on sale, if possible.",

            "review_text": " tl;dr It's just Dead Island 1.75. With parkour, drop kicks, and a slightly better story. Is fun, but littered with many problems. Not quite a 60USD investment, but worth checking out.    **Warning: This game has very bad optimization for AMD cards and chipsets. The game can run fine on medium settings, but setting your View Distance to a higher amount or even setting Textures to High can destroy your frame rate if you are not using a Nivida GPU with an Intel CPU. But even then, the game may lag.   If you liked Dead Island but hated how 'co-op' it felt because your character had little input in the story and it was just 'the group', you might enjoy this more. Crane is a lot more engaged than the protagonists of Dead Island, which is pretty nice. However, his personality is lacking and all over. Oddly enough, he starts getting interesting during a story mission half way through the game, but the following mission has him making wise-cracks the entire time.  Even though the story is better than Dead Island, it is still very predictable, incredibly cliched, and hilarious most of the time. I mean, the game craps its self in the most glorious ways for no reason. If you think something is going to happen, you probably already know what is going to happen. Also, Rais is a good villain in the sense you hate him and just want to kill him so you can make him shut up. But he's really a terrible villain with no real logic behind his motives and he's probably Russian just so we could have that Cold War grudge against him as well. There's a side quest where you have to track down a serial killer in the Old Town that has a more interesting antagonist than Rais because you can believe he's actually crazy.  The urban exploration is really the highlight of this game; getting around can be very fun when you start upgrading your agility and especially after you get the grappling hook. Many of the towers you can climb really are fun to scale and even feel like you are there with both how good the game looks and how well it handles ambient noise. For instance, while climbing a radio tower, you can hear the steel beams creak and sway in the wind. Also how Crane constantly adjusts himself while on thin ledges really add to the feel that you are a human doing these things, unlike most games where you feel like you are playing as a box. I say this game would have been perfect if it had no zombies or story and focused purely on the parkour.  However, the parkour is not without fault. Sometimes, Crane refuses to grab onto ledges while scaling and that can result into accidentally falling to your death (which also is your number one cause of death). Also Crane is just so slow when you start the game. Yeah, he's just a guy; but he is also a special agent and he doesn't really feel like he has had any physical training besides 'Above Average Strength and Stamina'. I suggest not sleeping at night and just let the Volatiles chase you around while you get double XP and get to a safe zone for the agility bonus until you get the first intermediate upgrade. Even then, just play at night anyway because the game becomes more fun.  The combat is simultaniously one of the worst but best part of the game. It's either frustrating because the big enemies have incredibly big AoE attacks that you have to dodge 2-3 times in one direction to maybe dodge (even though you may still get hit), or too easy because the same big guys can be killed in two or three well placed hits with an upgraded mid-game weapon or a vanilla late game weapon. For how realistic the game looks, it's crazy how cartoony the fighting is. You should be disgusted that you just kicked the hipbones out of a zombie's body, but  holy crap you just kicked the hipbones out of a zombie . The combat skills you get are hilarious and are very effective; you can dropkick a zombie and send him flying like he got shot out of a cannon, or you can kill a zombie by grabbing his head and gently turning him to the right, or you can kill a zombie by jumping off a roof and slamming an axe through its body with enough force to create a shockwave that sends every zombie in a 3m radius flying.  Even then, the game put a lot of focus on the melee combat but forces you into firefights frequently in the main story. There are only five guns to pick from (two handguns, two rifles, and one shotgun), and they never scale in stats. That rifle you found at level 11 is the exact same at level 25 although it now costs more because it is orange. Also you'd imagine that since you can find the same guns all game, you can find the same melee weapons too, but apparently there's weapon extinction. I have a blueprint I never used because it needs a baseball bat and I never found a baseball bat all game and now I can't ever find one because they are 'Low Level' weapons. I can fill all 18 inventory slots with Katanas and Khopeshes though!  I feel like the game blows its load on 'Visually Interesting' very early then doesn't pick its self back up again until much later for how muddy and brown almost the entire game is, and then Old Town just feels like Italy which felt out of nowhere, because apparently the Harran World Games were to put it 'on the map', but Harran was a global trade center for hundreds of years and a huge oil export with a rich cultural history.  This is the most well off apocalypse I have ever seen. You will get an abundance of cash and supplies only a few hours into the game. Just by playing as a kleptomaniac, you will never run out of anything you need besides String (at least in my experience, I only found about 20 pieces my entire time playing the main story, but started finding it all over after I beat the game). I'll even go so far to say that if you need ANY supplies right now, you could just add me and I could throw 20 of something at you and still have too much crap. You can even cross the bridge to get to a medical outpost and get about 25 medkits and gauze (as well as several police vans and ambulances to lockpick) inbetween missions and always have enough supplies.   I do find it very funny that the game tries to set up that the supply drops are a massive point of the game and the focus of survival, even though they stopped after two hours of playtime for me. Then they become far too common in the Old Town district (I found enough supply drops to get over 205,000 survival experience just by running around for an hour-- Not counting the XP you get from liberating the drops as well).  I also find it hilarious how often Crane gets his cover blown for how he is supposed to blend in and be a secret agent.   I will say the impression I got from early videos of the game was that you were just in the quarantine zone already and had to fight other survivors to get to the supply drops to survive, which I thought would be very interesting; seeing how people would act when supplies are low and there are zombies everywhere. But we barely get that and the game is just littered with random neutral survivors you have to save from time to time. I won't go so far to say that Techland again didn't deliver what they promised, but...  They didn't exactly deliver what they promised, again .   Edit: This is what max level feels like. ",

Slaying zombies is timeless and therapeutic, it's like sipping a cup of tea and having crackers in the afternoon.  Storyline's interesting but expect the typical hollywood cliches(as with other games) when you have a protagonist with an American accent.

Story and missions are good,game ambient on slums at day time feels a bit sick to be honest.  Co-op mode is fun, but when played at night time,its a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to revive knocked down team mates while chased by volatiles.  Need quick senses and focus if you wanna parkour like PRO through the slums and old town urban environment(empty handed is best choice,if you prefer parkour,more than zombie killing)  Nicely designed UI to Craft and modify weapons..which are really fun to use,but first gotta collect blue prints for that scattered across harran.  New parkour animations after enhanced edition Upgrade.Sad,techland did not make an animation while running diagonally with empty hands..its similar to running staight,hope they make that animation in future.  The following features country side and it does not deal much with parkour,driving a buggy is main thing here,but a headace to collect and repair the damaged parts because of reckless driving,its not a problem once buggy is fully upgraded.  Overall i personally rate up this game 8/10. Great job techland.  Looking forward to dying light next chapter.",

            "review_text": "Well I just finished the game and it was quite a ride. One of my biggest complaints about most zombie based games is that the stories are usually pretty weak, and a lot of this has to do to the necessity for co-op experiences. Dying Light has one of the best single player campaigns (although you can certainly play co-op) I have ever played and much of that is you become Kyle Crane, a GRE operative tasked with recovering a stolen file regarding the viral outbreak in Harran. The main missions guide you through quite a few individual missions, each one advancing the story. The story is quite good as you keep wanting to see more but you also have a plethora of side missions helping other survivors in many different ways. The mission design for both main and side missions is so varied that I don't think any really felt the same. And best yet, you really feel like you are helping the survivors when you complete these missions, as many of them sound like realistic requests during a fragile fight for survival.  The comparisons of a cross between Dead Island and Mirror's Edge is not far off. The parkour elements really shine in this game, and as you level up your agility you get access to more and more abilities that make you even better. It's quite a rush to run full flight jumping from rooftop to rooftop, executing quick climb and jump moves, and sliding under low hanging obstacles. The combat feels very much like Dead Island with a crafting system and modification system very similar. You must collect blueprints to expand your crafting and modification options; many become available as you spend survival points (which is mostly gained by completing missions or returning supply drops), or by finding blueprints in the world or by completing side missions or protection missions. Your combat ability is handled via power points, which are gained by hitting infected and killing them in a myriad of ways. Spending power points gives you access to different combat abilities like power swing, whirlwind with two-handed weapons, and death from above which impales an enemy when you are above them.   During daytime the game can be challenging as there are a lot of different special infected much like Dead Island. Come nighttime though, and all bets are off. The game becomes more of a stealth game as you try to avoid volatiles, the most powerful infected in the game. Early on you have no chance of killing one of these but as you reach higher levels and get access to better weapons with super modifications you can end up killing them in one power swing. The problem is, attacking a volatile or being seen by one immediately alerts every other volatile in the immediate vicinity. The speed that these volatiles close in on you and pummel you to death is astonishing. You may wonder why bother playing during the night as you can just sleep at any safehouse until the morning. Some missions require you to do them at night like the early one where you have to restore the full power grid at three substations. The other reason is all power and agility xp is doubled at night, which really makes a difference as I found agility to be lagging behind survivor and power xp. Also, the longer you survive at night the more bonus survivor points you will get once morning comes. I found I rarely ended up sleeping until morning, preferring to maneuver myself to specific locations by jumping between safehouses, trying to stay unnoticed by the volatiles but occasionally alerting them and booking it while throwing UV flares to slow the pursuit down.  Overall, this was a fantastic game that was so fun it was hard to put down. There are a few framerate issues where the FPS would drop to the single digits for 10-15 seconds until eventually clearing up. The graphics are gorgeous, the animations fluid, and the gameplay top-notch. The game works well with both keyboard/mouse and gamepad. I played with a gamepad mostly because 90% of the time you are fighting with melee weapons and I like the feel of the gamepad in that manner. If you like action/adventure games with good stories, a plethora of gameplay options, and the freedom to do what you want in the order you want, then I highly recommend this game. It's worth it at full price.",

        {
            "review_text": "There is one word that best descibes Dying Light: density. Dying Light takes everything great from Dead Island and massively improves on it.  At first glance, upon being let loose in the sandbox that is Dying Light, you may think the map is small. I know that was my first impression. As you explore the city and further the story, you find out just how large the map truly is. About halfway through the main story line, you will open up another large city area. The word density truly takes on meaning when you begin exploring this location. The game opens up more and more locations, including challenge areas (sort of like dungeons in Skyrim) as the game progresses. Interior locations are numerous, almost mind boggling at times, especially in Old Town. There are sewers to explore as well. Transition areas and hidden caverns also help to increase exploration time. Old Town is really 3 maps stacked on top of each other as there are layers and layers of places to explore. The Following expansion provides another area to explore, even larger than the main game.  And explore you shall. If you played Dead Island you remember how many times you had to loot that hard shell suitcase, which came in different colors to 'spice things up.' This became incredibly stale as your eyes became used to scanning for that same container, among just a few others. With Dying Light, looting shouldn't get too stale as the game presents more and more 'containers' for you to loot, such as cupboards, trash cans, crates, locked boxes, medicine cabinets, dressers, and of course the bodies of those you slay. The game will despawn bodies after a while but will drop a 'loot package' on the ground for you to loot when you feel safe enough to do so.  Loot is numerous and the amount of melee weapons you can wield is staggering. Just like Dead Island you can modify your weapons by attaching enhancements which increase power, stability, and or durability, as well as, elemental effects. Speaking of durability, at first you will be annoyed with this. I know I was. But after a while, as you find a greater variety of weapons such as rifles and pistols, you won't have to repair nearly as many times as you did at first as your arsenal will grow. Each melee weapon has a limited amount of durability, then it breaks. But again, you won't grow too attached to weapons as you'll have an infinite supply of them waiting to be looted or crafted. Yes, you can craft weapons and some of the best ones are hidden throughout the world as blueprints. Dying Light has quite a few easter eggs and hidden locations for you to find, adding even more density to an already deep game.  Gunplay is also great in Dying Light, a big improvement over Dead Island. The rifles sound 'meaty.' I highly recommend completing Bozak's Horde though. It's a challenge where, once completed, you receive blueprints to Bozak's Bow. This bow is great and is better than the ones added in The Following expansion. You can craft or buy arrows for it and you can retrieve your arrows most of the time after firing them. Any game with bows as a weapon has my interest right off.  The best way to describe what you can do in Dying Light is to compare it to GTA V. There are so many things to do you will often get distracted and forget what you started out for. Air drops add another layer of fun as they seem to entice you to put on hold your current task to get to them first. I remember that at one point I was trying to sneak into an area at night, attempting to avoid nightstalkers, and an air drop was initiated not too far from me. But in Dying Light, nights are dark, and I kept arguing with myself over whether or not going for the air drop was smart. I decided to take off running for it and alerted the nightstalkers around me by accident. I was almost there, I could see the airdrop. Almost there...I popped flairs around the air drop and the nightstalkers paused for a moment, screaming and clawing at the air. I hastily popped open the drop and looted it. The flair went out and the nightstalkers closed in and ripped me to shreds. Ah well. Maybe next time. These are the kinds of moments Dying Light can provide. Tense, rewarding, and at times dangerous.  I won't spend much time discussing the parkour element of the game as that's well known to everyone thinking about buying it. Let's just say that the parkour/player movement in this game is leaps and bounds (pun intended) better than ANY game in its genre. Movement is fluid once you get used to it. Add a grappling hook, which you get later on, and I'm sold...the movement and freedom in this game is liberating and will make it hard to go back to any open world game that restricts your movement.  I found the characters to be as interesting as they could be, considering the 'zombie apocolypse character archetype' has been used to death (pun intended) with the vast amount of zombie games out there. But, I remember all the main characters as they are engaging and sometimes funny enough to be remembered. Many other reviwers have commented that the characters and story are boring. I haven't found them to be so at all. The voice acting is well done and varied enough to keep you engaged. As you explore the city, you'll encounter survivors that are there saveable but some that are just waiting to tell you their story, adding to the lore of the game. It's touches like this that make a world feel as engaging as this one does.  I have yet to finish the story as I am having so much fun playing in this sandbox. Perhaps I never will finish the story. If that becomes the case, I won't feel cheated at all because it will have been my choice to just roam, kill zeds, loot, and explore to my heart's content.  Zombies are not difficult by themeselves. But, Dying Light's dense environments provide so many spots for zombies to hide that you can't ever get too comfortable. Loot that extra box at your peril. Killing zeds is extremely satisfying. Sometimes I find myself snapping out of a 30 minute 'kill fest' where I swear I was in a Kill Bill scene. Speaking of Kill Bill, you can use a katana in Dying Light!  Overall, I can truthfully say that Dying Light, plus its recent expansion called The Following, has and will continue to provide more return for my money than the last 5 games I've bought on Steam. The possibilities with this game are endless and when you add seamless multiplayer/coop to this discussion, you can see why Dying Light is worth the asking price if you like zombie or open world, 'do whatever you want' type games. If you're a gamer that likes to take your time, explore, loot, get distracted, etc. then I wouldn't be surprised if it provides you with 500+ hours of play time. I highly recommend this game and the season pass which includes all DLC.  10/10",

I find the night to be quite balanced, as the volatiles run faster than you but climb slower so you have to take advantage of the mirrors-edge style parkour that the game perfectly placed in, making it a much more interesting version of Dead Island with the free roaming aspect of it - quite unique to input a parkour system into a zombie game, but it was definitely a good mashup.

There are more DLC planned including a new huge area bigger than all of harran, and dune buggies and a whole crapload of other awesome stuff, but until then, here's my review of the vanilla game.    Graphics: 7/10    The game looks very good, but for many of us PC gamers, the texture pop-ins and the medium res textures can be of annoyance. However, this is one of those games where graphics are secondary to the gameplay. Not to say the graphics are bad at all, they aren't, but it leaves allot of Titan cards bored.  The graphics and overall aesthetic of the game is atmospheric and does work, but leaves me wanting higher resolution textures and a MUCH better option menu.    Sound: 10/10    I am a huge audiophile, I only accept the very best sound, no distortion, no jaggy treble, and this game is definitely to my satisfaction. The sound is all there, the footsteps, the grass, the sound of your weapon swinging and the soft sound of the rain is all jaw dropping in how well recorded/generated it is. Sound is not too important for allot of gamers, but if you're like me and you want the best of the best in your ears, pick this game up. Sounds great on my Sennheiser HD518's.    Gameplay: 9/10    The gameplay is a huge strong point of the game. The combat flows extremely well, the parkour flows even better, and chaining them both together will give you a bloody amazing gameplay experience. The gameplay takes the very best parts from Dead Island, and Assassins Creed/Mirrors Edge and slams those games and shows them how it's done. This game does the tower climbing better than Far Cry 3, Combat better than Dead Island, and Parkour better than Assassins Creed. I can't even begin to explain how satisfying the combat is, but just imagine running up a wall, jumping off, and in mid-air, dropkicking a zombie into a pit of spikes, or throwing a gas tank next to a big zombie and watch it smash the tank and explode. Completed this game, and I am not done at all.    Story: 5/10    Meh. Nothing new here. The story was alright in the first half of the game, but the drug sequence, and the 'CRAAAAAAAANE' literally made me cringe. They also gave us very few oppurtunities to connect with the characters that died, and the emotional way Crane bursts out just seems ridiculous given how he barely knew the people who just died, whilst he shoots looters in the face.  Little things:  Replayable? Yes Is it scary at night? Yes, when you start off. Does it run well? Not even on my GTX 970, but that doesnt make the game less enjoyable. Are the devs still active? Yes, they seem to be very active and they engage with their fans very frequently.  Eh. There's your review. I'm just gonna submit this and play more. More stuff is coming, the game is fun, it's on sale at the time of writing this review, and it's probably my GOTY.",

It is a far more polished game that Techland's previous Dead Island titles and, in the 48 hours I have been playing so far, I have not encountered many bugs or glitches and certainly no crashes.  Some of the optional side quests are a bit repetitive and unoriginal but the main story missions are varied enough to keep me hooked if the plot itself is as generic as they come. The game is stupidly addictive to play and it is very easy to find that what was intended as quick ten minute session turns in a two hour one without you realising. Graphically the game is solid rather than impressive (that ghastly chromatic aberration effect absolutely needs a toggle setting though...) and the audio and voice-acting are good overall. The story and writing is not great but who cares when there's a city to explore and lots of undead to kill?  Highly recommended.",

These days due to personal time constraints and other interests, it seems as though I finish very few games - especially open world ones like Dying Light. In open world games, I always get distracted by side missions and over time I lose interest in the story and move on to some other game. However, Dying Light kept my interest the entire time! I cannot place my finger on it, but this game was unique and absolutely engrossing for me. I'll probably go back in and finish the side missions I didn't complete before finishing the main story.  I RARELY went out at night unless a mission required it. I'm so glad a fast travel system was not included. It was interesting to see myself react when I knew night was coming and I was a distance from a safe house. The game is not full of jump scares like Alien: Isolation (a game I wanted to love but hated - the problem was me...not the game).  I have not played multiplayer or done any of the challenges so I cannot comment on that. I simply did the story and many side missions.  I cannot recommend this game enough!",

But the price of this game would not really satisfy some users, I recommend to wait for steam sales.  Only thing bothers me that once you complete the game then you have a chance to play a second walkthrough the new game plus, which means you can keep your skills/equipment, but enemies are tougher. I personally didn't notice any difficulty changes. Rather than that just seek out for some great mods that will change the gameplay for your own desire.  Edit: After DLC release The Following and Enhanced Edition. Game has been improved very well. They added this Nightmare mode which rocks hard so far, very challanging, especially if you are soloing. Totally recommending for those who are hardcore players and looking for a real challange.  More Edit: Well after progressing with legendary ranks you will get stronger and finding better weapons.. game comes quite back to normal difficulties to fight off the zombies.. still not the same like having infinite stamina. Nightlife is still dangerous, not like sandwich in one hand and controller in another hand.",

            "review_text": "What can I say about Dying Light?  I could say that it's FarCry mixed with Zombies and Mirrors Edge or some other lame comparison, but the truth is it's so much more.  The game had a bad launch as many titles do with a ton of bugs and optimization issues, but once you are past that and playing the patched up version there is a lot to see. The level of detail put into this game is amazing. Things you just run by are so well crafted and the attention to detail is amazing. Dying Light truely is a beautiful game.   At the start even normal zombies can be deadly, night time? Near impossible to confront anything and the terror sets in. The combat is fluid, the parkure is fantastic and smooth, and the side quests... Oh the side quests. Of course as the game progresses you do level up, and in doing so become near god like and really need to make mistakes to die. Want it harder? Use weapons that don't do as much damage and it will be a lot more demanding of your attention and skills.  If you have only been playing through the main story and not doing the side quests then you have truely missed what Dying Light has to offer. There is so much detail and story wrapped up in the side quests that it's hours and hours of game play. Some rich and deep, and others some what shallow and quick but not all have to be epic storys. The characters in the game develop in a way that keeps you at a slight distance while still giving you some hints about who they are. While we are talking about hints let us not forget about the easter eggs. They are everywhere, so many call outs to other games it's insane. There are several movie call outs as well, that are well placed in the game.   Many have tried to do the survival horror thing right, Dying Light does it, and it does it very very well. Co-Op is a blast and honeslty better than playing the game solo provided you have the right group and not just people that are flying through for the sake of flying through.  So if you enjoy good story, side quests, easter eggs, fun combat mechs with mutliple ways to engage, exploration, survival, and zombie games, then this is for you.",

PRO:  -The Day/Night cycle is very well done and help build the atmosphere of the game as zombies scale to your level, so unless you join a friend who is just starting out, fighting is always a challenge no matter what time of the day. -There's always a place to explore and scavenge, seriously like holy cow there's so much to find and look for I don't think you understand how much was put into the maps. -Graphics aren't mindblowingly awesome but are gritty enough to really make you feel you are in a war-torn zombieland. -The game doesn't shove crafting in your face. Like really all you need to craft early on is about 20 med packs, and you really don't need to do anything else. As a guy who really despises games who throw in crafting just to make it a selling point, it was reasuring to see that it wasn't a main focous of the development.  -Bashing heads dead or alive is so satisfying, really just seeing these litte buggers collapse to a well placed dome swing is just so rewarding in of itself. -Mod suport! -Night time is absolutely horrifying. During my time in the game I've never wanted to land once on the ground due to fear of what lurks below.   CON:  -Horrendously unoptimized. I've got a decent machine that can at least run these current gen types of games at high graphic levels, but all graphical features are either off or set on low.  -Freerunning isn't 100% ready, so you'll either be making jumps you didn't want or fall to your death multiple times. -The game itself feels like it needed another month to squash out these bugs, though to their credit the dev team has been patching the game every 3 or so days, so at least they've been taking care of their baby (unlike most AAA games released these days).  -The main story really isn't something to sing praises, plot holes galore, uninteresting, tries to force emotion by taking lives of characters that aren't really estableshed, and the main villain acts like he's so deep and understands that humans are scum bla bla bla. All in all it takes maybe 4 hours if you power through missions like crazy.    TL;DR  7.5/10 if you like the number system. All in all just straight up fun zombie survival game that feels like it had lots of love put into it, something that you don't see in games of this caliber these days. Has bugs, but the developers have been patching this game to bring it to the high standards they've set themselves since release. ",

Seriously though, I found Dead Island uninspired and boring, so this was not on my radar, however on some pretty high recommendations from a few steam friends, I ended up snagging it. Now I could safely say this game was the very embodiement of pure unadultared fun. (And I haven't even tried co op, only the multiplayer)  At 100% story completion, I could say this game tells a serviceable tale, with some genuinely interesting characters. This game elicited far more emotion than games like bioshock infinite and I actually gave a crap about the main characters. All in all, the story got the job done.   The parkour itself, was dreamlike, Techland my hat is off to you, this was pulled off perfectly. So fluid, so natural, I could tell you guys poured your heart and soul into this title and you have my utmost respect. The combat however, was a little hit and miss with fighting zombies, and felt too simiar to dead island, however the combat with humans was pretty satisfying. Also wasn't a fan of the gunplay sections, those felt tacked on.  Another thing I didn't enjoy was the massive amount of side missions, I spent at least 20 hours on these, with a ton more left over at 100% story completion, some of them didn't weave into the main narrative and felt like more of a boring distraction. Granted some were entertaining, and the payoff was worth it, in terms of items and side story information.    All in all I highly recommend this game. Traversal in games for some reason is a big deal for me,(Dragon Age i'm looking at you) and simply running, jumping, climbing,flipping,ground pounding, ziplining and jumpkicking around the map was immensely satisying. Looking foward to a sequel.",

Then the game released, more and more people were praising it over the internet, people like myself who were expecting another lackluster Dead Island-y thing. Eventually I caved and bought the thing, curious as to how 'another zombie game' could be rated so highly by people who were sick of zombie games.  Simply put, the game looks gorgeous, and is a hell of a lot of fun. The story's nothing to shout about, and is rather cliché, but the acting mainly on the part of the main character is good enough for me to actually feel some things coming from him at certain moments.   I still haven't completed the game, but I highly recommend everyone complete as many side quests as they can before doing any main quests, just to help increase the longevity of the game. The majority of side quests aren't bad either, and make you explore the map more.   In summary, highly unexpectedly great game, even if you're sick of the zombie survival genre of games, give this one a try, you'll have a lot of fun regardless.",

I also tried out the 'Be The Zombie' mode, and found it to be interesting but not very impressive. It felt very much like playing the alien in Aliens VS Predator (minus the wall crawling mechanics of course).  Overall, I'm sure I'll sink a few dozen hours into the game as I did with the Dead Island series.  UPDATE: I have been enjoying this game, but have two painful issues to report... 1.) When you play 'Be The Zombie' you can not invade a friend's game the same way you can co-op. They did not use the same friends awareness menu. That REALLY Kills the feature. Now, you can see games near you (low ping) that you can jump into, but not being able to play with friends easily really, really sucks. 2.) During cut scenes, I very often hear the speech, but the animation time slows down or continues for a few seconds after the audio is done. So it really saps the immersion when this occurs. ...still, I am enjoying the core game. But am VERY disappointed about the Be The Zombie mode not being readily available through the same CO-OP menu.",

            "review_text": "Dying Light, the second big title made by Techland after Dead Island, and it's a first person shooter, that has parkour going on with it, with zombies, in an open world setting, and it's good. I'd describe the game where it has Dead Island's zombies and nice combat, the open worldness and perspective of Far Cry, and the map design level and parkour of Assassin's Creed.  Starting with the graphics, they look really great, especially noticeable after the second half of the game. The animations and the lip-sync in cut-scenes or character interactions are noticeably not that good, and the graphical effects like blurry fog/water-drops are an inconvenience, and an annoyance that you have to put up with throughout the game.  The parkour controls are good and simple, and the melee combat controls are great and 'meaty', with the fire-arm controls being decent. The inventory management system isn't that great to interface with, at least not at first, which certainly could have been better.  The open world is fun and varied to play and parkour around in, with buildings to go through, and rooftops to hop on to. Filled with good amount of zombies, loot, and side missions to play with, and it's not cluttered with it, for example like Ubisoft games. The open world is also split into two big sandbox areas, the first one is nice and all, but the second one is where the beauty of the game is. A lot more nice to look at and to play around in, with how it is designed, more traversal and parkouring routes to have fun in, and just overall a better feeling to it.  The story isn't anything new, but at least they're trying to progress it in a way. Also, the main character you play as, he can kill, parkour and whatnot, and you'd expect him to have the ability to do those things because of who he is and how he is presented in the story, not just a random dude who got caught up in the mess, knowing how to do everything and be the best at it with no past experience. So what I'm saying is, Techland knows how to present a character, that makes sense, better than how Ubisoft presents them in their games.  The game is lengthy, with decently long campaign, and there being a lot of side quests that's, that's not that bad, you can do and finish. There's only one quick-time battle event in the game, it's short but still an annoyance to have it happen, made me think 'Really? Now you want to add a QTE?'.  The coop is fun, having another person, two, or three with you, jumping, exploring, and killing zombies and other enemy humans in the open world that it has for us to mess around with is really fun, kind of makes you feel like you own the city and have a really powerful group. Be The Zombie mode is really fun, it's like a toxic version of spider man, basically you can keep yourself afloat all the time, which is fun, but going against people is really hard though. Haven't dug deep into it so I'm not sure if it's a bad or a good thing that it's hard.  Techland really made a huge leap in quality from their first game, Dead Island, making Dying Light a nice surprise of fun and excitement, and the reason why I mention Ubisoft a couple of times is because they are doing a lot of stuff better then them, so much so that it's worth a mention. The game is fun and is worth your time and money. So, I'll just go hop back in coop and kill more zombies.  Shameless  link  [www.ksalue.com]  to original post.",

Night play is terrifying the first few times, but you quickly learn to use your feet and manuever around volotile zombies while keeping a healthy fear of them.

The ending is intensly satisfying and while the main storyline itself follows some predicatable turns, it doesn't do it in a way thats so obvious you could plot out the entire story arc in the first fifteen minutes. You can try, but there is a feeling you might get it wrong that makes you want to keep playing.

            "review_text": "Dying Light is the best zombie-game up to this date. Atmosphere filled post-apocalypse with strong emphasis on survival. Fighting and movement/parkour feels fantastic and quick. The world is huge and very detailed, and hence very satisfying to explore. The world is very immersive with some varying weather and day-night cycles, where it gets much more dangerous during the dark. The story is interesting enough: epic at times, but overall standard and sometimes cheesy. The character you control is fun and sarcastic, overall adding to the shifting sense between dramatic and humoristic world. Overall this game excels as a an action game with a rich world to explore.   The game reminded me of Stalker some times, where you can never be too sure how an encounter or a situation will end. Other times it reminded me of Fallout, where if you pay attention to details when exploring, you can find small clues telling a short story of i.e. what happened to that corpse in the bed. The game's graphics are fantastic (but I am aware that some people have experienced technical problems), especially the lighting is very immersive and atmospheric.  Dying Light lets you play the way you prefer. You can be quick and fast, practicly flying and sliding through the city. Or you can be slow and explore your surroundings. The best part is that both approaches are rewarding in their own way, but I would suggest the slower exploring style, due to all the fantastic detail that can be observed.  The zombies are traditional, in that sense that they are almost no match for you when you single one out. But once you are surrounded by a group, everything changes. And as is standard in many classic zombie stories, man can often turn out to be your worst enemy.  Dying Light also offers many side quests, some of which are really epic, both in terms of action and humor. Some other quests are simple fetch-tasks, but are complimented by the main characters reactions: such as tossing the fetched package at the quest-giver angrily and insulting him/her. It' satisfying that way.  The game offers lots of variety in terms of surroundings, enemies, side quests, items, and locations. An approximate estimation is that it will keep you entertained and engaged for 40-50 hours. If the modding tools deliver in the future, this game could have so much more.   I played mostly single player and found it superior to coop. Coop was too simple, where the otherwise threatening world turned into a easy playground. I hope this gets adressed in the coming hard mode.  The infamous night mode is a very strong aspect of why the game feels so fresh, but here I also found a loophole. It is very easy to avoid the dangerous zombies through the mini-map, which literalily makes the night time a breeze. I found it much more engaging when trying my best to ignore the game's clues, and relying on hearing only (since it is otherwise dark..). This hopefuly will be attended to in the hard-mode which is coming from the developers.",

It's simply not a genre I care about because I generally find zombies to be fairly boring enemies to fight.   But after poking the reviews and seeing a lot of comments like '20 hours played, 15% of story complete. 10/10', this implied that there was more to the game that it seemed. Indeed, I took a chance and dropped the full 60$ on this and I turned out to be fairly surprised, and pleasantly so.  For me, what sets this apart is the ability to parkour around. This makes traversing the cityscape a lot more interesting and keeps this game from being a boring slog 'Point A to Point B' with some zombie-smacking in between.  What I continue to love most about this game is how it's multi-genre'd. After a few hours of play, by day, you'll be a powerhouse with weapons that will be able to one-shot the standard zombies (If you aim properly). Daytime is scavenging/questing time.  But by night, it becomes a prolonged stealth mission. Double experience gain, a few quests that can ONLY be done at night, and enemies that will destroy you regardless of levels and weapon statistics, if you allow yourself to be 'alerted' for too long. Every night is absolutely intense and it's just great fun. Add to the fact that once you encounter 'Bolters', enemies that will literally flee at the sight of you, hunting them is like an assassination mission as you can only kill them by sneaking up behind them. You could shoot them, too, but have fun with its four Volatile buddies that like to hang out.  So what's keeping me on this game is the variance it offers. Traversing the land is fun, slaughting zombies en masse is great, and sneaking around at night is an intense and great experience.  I've been recommending this to most of my friends.",

            "review_text": " Recensione Italiana in fondo   ---  Welcome to  Dead Island 2  Dying Light.    For the one who already know Dead Island's saga:  Dying Light is heavily, really a lot, based on DI's mechanics, you will still find a distant tropical city with an unknown infection, a huge load of loot and weapons that can be upgraded with projects, all of this while you level up your character in 3 different skill trees.  Plus you will have parkour style movements that will allow you to jump over obstacles, climbs on various surfaces, run over cables between roofs and many other things, including a grappling hook later in the game.   For the one that don't know the Dead Island's saga:  Add to what we said above that the game is an open world first person shooter where the weapon you will usually use are melee weapons, not guns, and you will have a questlog system to keep track on what missions you have and what to follow. The main focus of the game is that you will find various components during the game (iron pieces, gauze, electric cables,...) by looting item and corpses and with those things you will be able to upgrade your weapons with projects you will learn around. Plus the various actions you will perform (doing missions, do parkour, fighting, ...) will give you experience points in 3 different branch (Survival, Agility e Combat) that work like 3 independent skill-tree that will grand abilities to your character making him stronger.  Dying Light has a slighty more serious feel compared to his two predecessor(the 2 Dead Island) with more aggresive and resistant zombies that will force you at the low levels to stay on the roofs, plus the Night that not only will increase the zombies stats but will spwan the Nocturnal, ferocius zombies that will be your nightmare at least until halfway the game. The story looks like to be trying to follow a more mature and emotional path but in my opinion they did not meet the wanted results, it's clique and not engaging with predictable plot twists. Even your big nemesis that I think was born like an evil, slightly mad but charismatic character is a collage of boring catchphrases and 'already heard' speeches.  The good side is that this is a big game with two ample maps (Slums and Old Town) where you can't fast travel (except from map to map) and with various random events that vary with the story. Even the secondary missions are many (more than 50 if you count every mission that lands in your questlog) and the main story count a quite good amount of missions as well. To complete it with almost all the secondaty missions done (except the single players one, see below) it took me 45 hours in coop.  Pro:     Many missions, many hours of gameplay    Stunning graphics    Really beautiful to play with friends    Thousands of moddable weapons    Parkour movements system is well done and funny   Cons:     Story lack of originality    As well as the npc characters, clique and don't develop    At high levels the fear for the night and the zombies hordes goes away, you are Terminator    If you want high graphics you will need a really good computer    Single player mode only for the protection missions, a weird choice for a coop oriented game. Even more if you think that they were coop in Dead Island    Weird choice as well to make the FINAL mission single player only    It remembers WAY TOO MUCH Dead Island (excluded parkour), they should have tried something more   ---  Benvenuti in  Dead Island 2  Dying Light.   Per quelli che già conoscono la saga di Dead Island: Dying Light è fortemente, molto fortemente, basato sulle meccaniche di DI, troverete ancora una remota città tropicale con una infezione misteriosa, loot a non finire con svariate armi alle quali applicare progetti mentre sviluppate il vostro personaggio tramite 3 skill set differenti.  In più avrete dei movimenti in stile parkour che vi permetteranno di superare ostacoli, correre, scalare edifici, sfruttare corde sospese e più avanti nel gioco anche un rampino.  Per quelli che non conoscono la saga di Dead Island: Oltre ciò detto sopra sappiate che il gioco è un first person shooter open world dove le armi che andrete ad usare principalmente sono le armi da mischia, non quelle da fuoco, e avrete un sistema di questlog che vi permetterà di scegliere quale missione seguire in un dato momento. La caratteristica del gioco è il poter trovare componenti vari (pezzi di metallo, garze, componenti elettronici,...) con le quali potrete creare dei potenziamenti per le vostre armi. Inoltre le differenti azioni che farete (completare missioni, fare parkour, combattere, ...) vi daranno punti esperienza in 3 diversi settori (Sopravvivenza, Agilità e Combattimento) che funzionano come skill-tree indipendenti dai quali scegliere varie abilità che renderanno il vostro personaggio migliore.  Dying Light è caratterizzato da un'impronta leggermente più seria dei suoi predecessori (I 2 Dead Island) con zombie più cattivi e resistenti che ai livelli bassi vi costringeranno a stare sui tetti e l'avvento della notte che non solo migliorerà la forza dei non morti ma farà anche comparire i tremendi notturni che fino ad almeno metà gioco saranno il vostro incubo. Anche la storia sembra voglia seguire un'impronta più matura ed emozionale anche se a mio avviso non hanno centrato il bersaglio, risulta scontata e poco coinvolgente con colpi di scena facilmente prevedibili. Anche la vostra grande nemesi che penso avessero inteso come una persona malvagia, un po' pazza ma carismatica è un'insieme di frasi 'ad effetto' poco originali.  Il lato buono però è che si tratta di un gioco molto vasto con due grandi mappe (Bassifondi e Città Vecchia) nella quali non è possibile viaggiare rapidamente (a parte da una maxi mappa all'altra) e con svariati eventi casuali che mutano ad un certo punto del gioco. Anche le missioni secondarie sono svariate (più di 50 se si tiene conto di ogni missione che va nel quest log) e la storia principale si difende bene in termini di numero di missioni. In tutto per completarlo con quasi tutte le missioni secondarie fatte (tranne le singleplayer, vedi poi) ci ho messo 45 ore in coop.  Pro:     Tante missioni, tante ore di gioco    Grafica mozzafiato    Bellissimo da giocare con altre persone    Migliaia di armi modificabili    Il sistema di movimento a parkour è molto divertente e ben fatto   Contro:     La storia non brilla certo per originalità    Così come i personaggi che incontrerete sono alquanto piatti    Ai livelli alti la paura della notte e delle folle di zombie scompare, siete Terminator    Requisiti di sistema esosi se volete alzare il livello della grafica    Missioni di protezione solo single player, scelta bizzarra in un gioco che punta al coop. Ancora di più considerando che esistevano coop in Dead Island    Così come la missione finale è solo single player, scelta strana     Ricorda davvero troppo Dead Island nelle meccaniche (escluso il parkour), avrebbero dovuto osare di più  ",

            "review_text": "Dying Light is not what I expected it to be. I wasn't really excited for the game, saw no interest in it as I am not into these zombie survival type games. However, I found a good deal on the game and thought, why the hell not? When I started playing the game I was just blown away. I wasn't expecting a beautiful open world game. I was expecting a game that tried to be as scary as possible for no reason.  The story is great. It shows the epic tale of the survivors in Harran fighting to stay alive and get out of the hellhole. Once nighttime hits you realize this is the most hard and scary parts of the game. Special types of zombies appear especially at night that are ruthless killers. You can avoid the night by sleeping in your safehouses, which are located all throughout the map and you have to 'liberate' to make them yours.  The graphics are very gorgeous. The world is detailed and full of interesting things to explore. However, as you progress through the quests I noticed a lot of the characters looked very similar to each other and thought that ruined the immersion.  The gameplay is great and frustrating at the same time. Running around Harran in the slums or old town you are constantly climbing and jumping from rooftop to rooftop. I think Techland did a great job with the parkour and nailed it. At times it felt like a first person Assassin's Creed or Mirror's Edge in a post apocalyptic world. However, the combat is sometimes very frustrating, it could take up to 10-20 hits to kill a enemy and is annoying and tedious trying to kill them.  A thing Techland could have added is fast travel although it may seem like cheating in a survival game like this. It gets a little tedious and annoying running from ends of the city to the mission objectives and I feel as if there was a faster way to travel around the city it would be a lot greater. Near the end of the game we are given a grappel gun which does indeed help moving around a little faster but this is something that should be looked on in the sequel.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I feel like the game exceeded my expectations and proves Techland can make games that don't fall into the cliche zombie survival type games.  9/10",

            "review_text": "I love the game and whole-heartedly recommend it. But for my review, it's going to be frank and include the gritty parts which annoyed me and may contain progression spoilers. You can read the positives elsewhere.  Early on in the game, everything you do has an impact to your survival, such as, scavenging for materials, lockpicking chests for weapons, cash and vendor items, however, like Dead Island, later on there is no point in doing so.   My reasons for saying this is because I am on the second map, at about 80% complete and have amassed 200+ of every crafting material, I have $500,000 and nothing to spend it on, all weapons looted after vendors start selling orange items are worthless, and when you reach maximum survivor rank, airdrops aren't worth your time either. I achieved all this by approximately 65% completion.  Mods and materials are so abundant, that there's no real survival element to the game. The only part which can be considered so, is the weapon durability and permanent loss when it finally breaks. However, a fully upgraded orange weapon (3 King mods) will last you so long, that you will only need to find/buy a new one every 30% of the story. That, and with the perk that gives the possibility of a free repair (it's given me 4 free repairs on my current weapon, with 3 repairs remaining), I haven't had to replace the weapon since the previous map. But that could be attributed to picking my fights, rather than mindlessly slaughtering zombies.  Vendors also have this annoying trait of advertising weapons for higher survivor ranks, which you cannot purchase until you reach that level, and then rejigging their inventory when you level up. Then advertising even higher level weapons, thus rendering having them in their shop inventory 'effing pointless. 'Look at this lovely orange katana. Want it?... Tough.'. Also regarding weapon purchases, the docket system they employed as part of pre-purchase, is a complete waste of time. From survivor rank 1 to 25, not one of my 16 dockets gave me a weapon that wasn't instantly vendored, because it was less than total trash.  Most of the blueprints in the game are useless. I have around 20 of them, but have only used 3 types. 'Puke 'N Nuke', 'Toxic Reaper' and 'Bolter Poison'. Puke 'N Nuke is terrible, as more often than not, it makes the zombies explode, attracting volatiles, which you then have fight off, which makes them explode, attracting more... rinse and repeat. I use bladed weapons, so I hack the zombies heads off in one click, rendering the weapon's elemental effect pointless. They only come in handy for the larger zombies (late game Goons and Demolishers... which I kill in 2 power strikes anyway). Any of the fire or toxic effects will more than likely hurt you as much as it does the zombies, so you're best going for something that adds bleeding, because at least you won't die along with them. I hated this self damage mechanic in Dead Island and I hate it now.  And I don't know about anyone else, but I'm sick of exploding zombies. How does a poppable, fleshy, bloody mess, even hurt a person, let alone kill them in one?. I'd much rather have the explosive effect disorient me, or blind me because I'm covered in gore.  Other than all of the outlined grievances (of which there are more, but my hands hurt from typing) Dying Light is a satisfying zombie Hack 'N Slash, with replayability, especially if you play in coop mode after the single player experience.",

The combat is satisfying, though you will end up bypassing zombies a lot of the time not only because it's not worth your time to stop and bash some brains in but you will also be concerned about the condition of your favorite Hatchet. The freerunning and combat each level up through use, so the more you run and jump and hit the farther you progress in your skill trees. The beginning level of freerunning will feel sluggish but you get the 2nd tier not too long into the game and the difference between the two is pretty substancial.   Quest system and storyline feel familiar to playing in a Far Cry game, so if you're a fan of that style then you'll feel right at home. It really is Mirror's Edge plus Far Cry plus Zombies and there is nothing wrong with that because they sure as hell made it work.",

I also really appreciated the way the devs made it feel like a real zombie experience because you are actually scared of the zombies; you can't run in with you machete and expect to make through the other side in the main game (unless it is the super OP lighting one that you get from a side quest). Honestly, I found the most fun I had was when I was doing the 'race to checkpoints' parkour or the 'we will give a ridicilous weapon and you get to fight zombies that would otherwise completely destroy you' side missions.

Best zombie slasher ever and its open world, best of both genres combined make for an awesome co-op, pvp and singlaplayer during the main story (drop in and out anytime) experience like no other game with a lot moding posibilities and also custom maps and more. Its scary, its violent, its totaly brutal at night, its beatiful, its parkour, its hardware demanding too tho With the expansion its the perfect 1st person horror/survival game a must have masterpiece in gaming. Craft you brutal meele weapons and get some guts on you  Cons:  -Not many guns and ammo, I do miss the gunplay sometimes, but without guns when its up close and personal, that is where the game gets its real kick from -It does still need a bit more optimalization",

            "review_text": "24 hours in and I am only at 22% completion. LOVE THIS GAME. Unless something major brings it down, I am giving this a SOLID 9/10.  Very entertaining FPS open world zombie survival game. Would recommend to any fans of FPS. Especially if you, like me, enjoyed the Dead Island games, this is a major upgrade without loosing the fun of those games. And yes, you can still stand on truck and clunk down 20+ biters with no danger to yourself. just don't get caught in the open.  If you're worried about the parkour elements, they are not as necessary as they are in the Assasins Creed series. They just make it easier to move around the city. Ane a beautiful city it is. Very well designed, multi levels, with tons of depth and clutter. Good story, voice acting and the game looks great on modern hardware. The map is one of the best I have ever played. It really feels like a city. So much depth and levels.  I would recommend getting it now, especially since its on sale. Don't bother with the season pass imho, the dlc looks very thin.  Spoiler Review:  well, one more piece of good news, there are more than one map, including one whole new city one and a bunch of mini areas, not including buildings.   Now, the bad. Crappy ending that makes no damn sense (well, maybe sorta in a video game). They done ruined it, by taking away any sense of immersion with a cartoony villain. Who gets multiple chances to kill you and in true retro-Bond fashion, taunts and plays with instead of just shooting you. Why oh why do developers keep doing this?? All his parts after the initial meeting are so lame. Makes the damn 'challenges' in a zombie apocalypse seem logical. At least these can be mercifully skipped.  So, an updated score is 8.5/10. Still a good game, but not in the ranks of the great games. Buy it on sale or when/if you hardware can take it, you can probably afford anyways.",

            "review_text": "If you want to relate to Dying Light to any form of game individual would be impossible, without taking away from the overview of it. This game combines the features, mechanics, and controls of several different games, melding them together with the occasional bump here and there, though seamless from a distance.  Essentially, Dead Island went through an existential crisis, called up it's distant friend Far Cry 3, and called it's neighbor Mirror's Edge, and the three of them came together to make this enticing game!    Actual Review (No Story Spoilers!):  The parkour elements in this game are a definite highlight, with great mobility being given to the player with little regard for any sense of pre-laid paths, opening the environment for any individual to reach, with enough elbow-grease. The parkour elements are followed by the combat style. The combat, for when you choose to fight, is both solid, and satisfying. Varying between ranged and melee, quick strikes and heavy hitting, running-and-screaming or sneaky-sneaking, you really have opportunity for going at missions however you want.   Crafting is next. There are vast options to improve current weapons, giving them varied attacks, and overall damage boosts, as well as increasing the durability, handling, and pure damage output of the weapon. Past that, various thrown weapons - from explosives to knives - are presented, along with injections made from ingredients found around you to briefly increase your character's preformance.   The zombies in Dying Light are also varied, and divert from one type of zombie. This game gives you the chance of either staying to fight a shuffling hoard of Walking-Dead-esq zombies, or give you the chance to flee across rooftops from a hungry-looking Viral (agile zombies). The more uncommon zombies that share unique characteristics can be compared to those from Left 4 Dead, with unique styles and actions that seperate them from pure generalization.   The Day and Night cycle is something to admire, with visual displays of the shadows moving across the ground as the sun gradually ticks by in this virtual world. During the day, you have your activites, alert missions, challenges, and pure exploration. During the night, you can do everything listed above, though theres a catch: the zombies become substantially hungry at these dark hours. With limited light and vision, constantly checking your surroundings and watching for any amount of sound you might make, anything to dodge and sneak past the lingering, drooling beasts that hunt for you and you alone; and these hunters aren't easy to become prey. But hey, if you can somehow survive the hazardous hours of the night, you get double points! Yay!  Dislike playing alone? Dying Light's got you covered there. Bring your friends into co-op, up to 4 players, and even share in the thrill of shared mission experience and advancement together! Challenge your friends to a race, a kill-count, and much more! Dying Light, however, doesn't make the game easier by keeping everything the same, with more people. No no no, it balances to a point; more uncommon zombies spawn, along with generally larger zombie spawns, yet thankfully, no friendship-shattering loot competition!     Opinion:  The game is the first zombie-based game in a long time that has caught my eye. Additionally, it was the first game in a long, long time that I bought the day it came out, without any amount of regret so far. I have fun just running around, exploring, and killing ♥♥♥♥! I haven't played any game the past few days for more than an hour, knowing that Dying Light is still unfinished, and in my library. It's got a few bugs here and there, some of them personal complaints, but overall, the game is near flawless!  Though if anything, better optimization would be nice.    Overall Rating:  96/100.   I love this game, it's extraordinary, fun, a thrill, along with a fulfilling and satisfying experience. I cannot recommend this game enough.",

Daytime really feels like this urgent rush to find what you need and do what you need to do before nightfall. Nighttime, however, really puts players on edge. The Volatiles are fast, numerous, hit really hard, and can take a beating. There is a legitimate sense of 'Oh ♥♥♥♥ oh ♥♥♥♥ oh ♥♥♥♥' around every corner. The crafting is easy and the mods are plenty, as is the weapon selection and choice. While this may be fun and all, the multiplayer is quite a different story.   The multiplayer is, by far, the most one-sided game I have ever had the misfortune to play. If you want to get gold tier weapons, you have to reach rank 25 in the Survivor skill and play PvP for a CHANCE to get 'powerful' weapons. Here are the pros and cons of both the human(s) and Hunter(s).  Humans: Pros: -Guns -Explosives *That's it.*  Cons: -Only 10 lives amongst all human players in the match -UV flashlight does far too little, far too slowly -The UV flashlight can be disabled and it's, literally, the only way to stop a one-hit KO. Once you're grabbed, you're done  without it.  Hunters:  Pros: -Can infinitely grapple around the map -Has a one-hit kill move that doesn't have a cooldown -Launches bombs that disable the UV flashlight -Launches bombs that cause a mob of explosive Virals to chase the player(s)  -Can stun players who are using the UV flashlight even though the Hunter's power may be drained  -Total of 5 hives, each containing ~4 spawners that have an absurd amount of health and are heavily guarded by Virals  and Goons -Infinite lives -Decent amount of health -Regens health and stamina very quickly  Cons: -*Mildly* vulnerable when exposed to UV light for too long.  *Aaand that's it.*  Ways to balance the PvP: -Scale the instances around the number of human players in the match -Add human AI to help single human players -Make regular virals chase the human(s) rather than explosive ones -Lower the HP of the hives by half -Increase the number of human lives -Maybe add a dueling button mashing sequence when a human is grabbed by the Hunter -Give the Hunters a limited number of lives  Here's hoping that the DLC will give the multiplayer a much needed fix.",

            "review_text": "This game:  Is satisfying   Has Great Co-op  Has great killing Mechanics  Has A lot of Gore  And is well optimized  8.5/10    Detailed thoughts:  This game never really stuck out that big to me when first released. I had seen gameplay but it never really drove me into wanting to get it. Maybe it's the idea that almost every game i buy these days are games that i'll play for maybe an hour then stop playing all together. Game's haven't been as appealing as they used to be. They're lacking a charm that made video games so popular years ago. Yes, there's still good games been released such as Fallout 4 which i loved, Life is Strange which i also love and a few others such as JC3 and so on. These are all fun games that have charm that a lot of video games these days are lacking.   Story line:  As of writing this, i have yet to complete the story. I cannot say for sure my thoughts on it yet as i really can't judge a game until i've finished playing it, however, as far as i have gotten into the story, it seems to be a decent story. Doing missions is fun especially with a friend as you can have the advantage of two people fighting their way through the hordes of zombies that may be attacking them. I think i could play this comfortably in single player but i'm hard to please when it comes to game and grabbing my attention with a good story is hard so playing this with a friend definitely boost the experience.    Mechanics:   The Mechanics in this game of the fighting and movement system and many other things is almost perfect. Killing zombies could not get anymore fun than it already is. The moment your boot touches the face of a zombie while you're in the middle of a drop kick attack is just music to my eyes and ears. I stare visciously at the pOols of BlooD aNd WiPe AwAY THe TEArS OF HAPPINESS AND THEN I TAKE OUT A KATANA AND SLICE THAT ♥♥♥♥♥ INTO A THOUSAND DIFFERENT BODY PARTS UNTIL IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE IS ON A REAL GORY PERIOD. Seriously though, the fighting and movement systems is just perfection. If you're ever having a real bad day or just angry of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of, you know exactly what to do buddy.   Map:  The map design isn't bad! There is tonnes of detail around the city which many games require to make for a good experience but some games lack. Although full of detail, Harran isn't entirely huge and borders are pretty awful. It lacks any countryside whatsoever although from what i understand, the new DLC released in Feburary contains a new map that's based in the countryside. Harran however just doesn't have great borders. Some areas are block off that really don't need to be blocked off and it feels like and open world game that isn't fully open. Almost like a WIP game but the mechanics and map detail makes up for this for me at least.     Visuals/Asthetics and Optimization:  This game just straight up looks good. Very pleasing to the eye and i honestly wouldn't ask for a game to look better. It may not surpass the new tomb raider game released this year but it's still beautiful. This game runs beautfiully well for the amount of detail it contains and how well it looks. It seems to me that you may need a somewhat decent CPU to run this with 60+ fps as it seems to be CPU intensive but on my medium end AMD system, i can run the game on medium graphic settings and still achieve a minimum of 30fps and a max of 60fps. Comparing to games out there like Just Cause 3, this is impressive.    Overall quick summary:  Definitely worth a buy if you have a friend to play it with. Many hours of fun will be had with this. From gore to weapons and mechanics, this game has everything a hardcore gore and zombie fan wants.  And as a side note, i want to thank my friendeio (friend) who very kindly bought me this game even though he should have kept it for himself and gotten himself a bunch of other games but i appreciate it mate.

Okay, it kinda is but it's executed so well. The parkour is my most favorite part of the game. It takes everything that Mirror's Edge did and refines it to actually make things even more fun. Even the combat is much improved over it's Dead Island cousin. While the first few hours is kinda a tiny bit too hard but after a few side missions and getting a few perks, it's so much fun. I even love the crafting system. Dead Island's was so boring and I never used it because the process was so unnecessarily convoluted.  All in all, if you wanna play a zombie game that has the fun of Mirror's Edge with the action of Dead Island, get this game. Especially since it has mod support. Playing with a survival mod is so much fun. And you actually can scavenge for stuff, unlike in DayZ.",

            "review_text": "Dying Light is a game about two things. Killing zombies in many ways and finding loot. The game is an open world first person hack and slash game. Similair to Elderscrolls Skyrim. It is set in a modern day middle eastern country named Harran.   The game utilises a free running system like in Assassins Creed or Mirrors Edge, allowing you to climb, walk or run up/along most objects in the world. It is extremely satisfying to climb up a building to escape from a horde of zombies. Overall I think the game is great and is a worthy purchase. The online co-op works well and is how i personally played/beat the game.  Pros  - Decent length. (I spent 40 hours or so in the game. I did 38 of 44 side quests and didnt collect many of the collectable statues)  - Combat is fluid and the free running is fun. It is fun using electric machette's and flaming hammer to cave skulls in.  - I found the story quite good. I enjoyed it and it kept me wanting to move forward. Some people have said they feel it is over dramatic but I personally enjoyed it.  - The co-op is great. It works well and is a blast. You can roam freely without many restrictions. Its fun working together to tag team zombies/save people in the city.  The leveling system is pretty good as well. You have 3 Trees to put perks into. Power. (combat) Agility (free running) and survivor (Saving people/quests etc). Each trees levels up individually and give you a fair amount of choice in how you want to place. For example you can pick an ability called Camouflage which allows you to sneak around.  Cons  - The game can be a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with its placement of special infected. Boomers in doorways that you need to go through. If you dont kill them from range they literally one shot you resulting in having to go back to a check point.  - The game has some bugs. Graphical glitches with npcs. Closing doors on themselves. Audio decoupling. Bizzare ragdolls. Sometimes your character Wont grab onto something resulting in you falling to your death.  - The grappling hook often decides that it doesnt want to work, resulting in your death. Its an amazing tool when it functions right but my friend and i believe we died more to it making us fall to our deathes than anything else lol.  - While i feel the skill trees are interesting, near the end of the game i felt like i was just putting points in things for the sake of putting points in them even though i knew id never use them.  Overall.  While the game had some issues and frustrations. Im looking at you grappling hook! I had a blast. Id highly recomend the game to friends, especially if you pick it up with 1-3 friends and go on a zombie bashing rampage. Gets the big thumbs up from me! At 60 dollars the game is great. It will be a steal when it goes on sale!",

There have been some glitches on surfaces, but overall it runs smoothly, even when in multiplayer. The coop is great. Too many people trying to be the zombie currently. It can make nights last forever, but you earn huge exp for it. Also it's easy to win as the survivors if you keep you cool. I have won 7 of 8 matches with just two people.  Gameplay mechanics function pretty closely to the Dead Island series in terms of combat. There are no specializations with characters anymore however and just a universal skill tree. The movement is really one of the high points for myself. It is a HUGE world and you are free to roam wherever you please. It's not like some sandbox games where it's 'open' but 3/4 of the map is blocked off and you can't access it or you have only certain routes you can take to locations. This is truly a game where you can go anywhere you can reach.  The sound is used very well in the game. You hear them approaching, the screams in the distance, and the dread of rushing volatiles or hunters really gets you going. The in game chat is the low point currently as there is no controls over adjusting volume or push to talk. The sound does help with the appropriate dread you should feel.  Lastly, that previously mentioned dread is what I think was really missing from the Dead Island series. I was never really scared or anxious the whole time I played them. You will panic the first nightfall. You will forget how to climb when you are cornered. It will be awesome.",

The Gameplay is fantastic, allowing you to climb up almost anything you want to climb, and do what you want; Do you want to run into a horde of zombies swing your Electrified Rebar around? You Can! Do you want to stick to the rooftops and gun down any enemies down below? You Can! With the wide variety of melee weapons and blueprints, you can use whatever weapon fits you, how about a Blunt Baseball Bat? No? A Sharp Machete? No? Or how about a pistol? You choose what you want to do, you can also obtain a wide variety of skills, from Drop-kicks, to making grappling hooks, to jumping on zombies heads! Overall the gameplay deserves a 10.  You can also play in Co-Op. Co-Op has you and your friends (or random people) completing the story together. Or how about being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and becoming a mutated zombie, known as a 'Volatile' invading other people's games and killing them, fitting your needs? 9 for the Co-Op.

I've only been playing co-op. No solo play or be the zombie yet.  Pros crafting is simple combat is satisfying the mix of hunting and being hunted is addicting  Cons- could be more variation in quests and more than just zombies with a slight hand full of human enemies as far as I can tell with 27% story complete..  Over all I think this game is great, nice time sink and pretty solid way to get rid of some stress and laugh a bit when you send a zombie rag-dolling through the air to it's death.  I hope to see an abundance of mods for this game, I could see that extending it's life quite far. I know once I start learning more code this is one of the first games I'll be modding when I feel like i'm good enough at coding.   __________Update__________  Further into the game, now onto the 2nd half of the story I've had the game crash about 4 times and there were large amounts of very very noticable clipping. It feels like the 2nd half was rushed in some parts, finally payed attention to the childred, and some of the misc npcs, but mainly the children in this game seem like their modles had no time put into them. All of this being said, I think the crashes were flukes, I'd still recomend this game even with a few of it's hicups, gameplay is solid and that's what i like in my games GAMEPLAY.",

As you can see by my hours played, there's a ton of fun to be had there. But that's about it. That's fine though. It's more than enough to recommend getting it, maybe on sale.  The rest of the game is really hit or miss. Mostly miss. There's not an original character to be found, only 4 of the main characters have any kind of resolution and none of them are earned. The story itself is just beyond poor. Every single beat is frustratingly stereotypical at best, non-sensical at worst, and often both. The gameplay is balanced all out of whack and very quickly you'll be one shotting everything.   The added Hard and Nightmare modes I like, if only because I love devs who do things like that when players ask for it. Apart from that they're not a good time. They make pretty much everything tedious. Looting becomes all you do and running into every friggin house to look through cupboards is not fun, especially in a giant, pretty world like this that then disappears in the process of constantly staring at the ground. Fighting is also tedious. For example, on Normal there's a type of enemy that is tougher and meaner, but only really comes out if you're ♥♥♥♥ing around recklessly. It's a standard game trade-off. On Hard and Impossible 5 or 6 of them just show up every ten minutes no matter what you're doing, and you'll lose half of your weapons durability dealing with them. Regular enemies still outrageously resillient at endgame, even with the strongest weapons. Human enemies can take 4 point blank shotgun headshots and be fine, while you, much more realistically, die from 2 or 3 bullets at most. It's just not fun.  The expansion is more of the same, except now you have to go much further to complete short objectives on fetch quests, which is every quest. You do get to drive, if that's your thing. Same as the campaign, the endings don't fit at all because there's no reason to give a ♥♥♥♥ about anyone or anything beyond needing to deal with them to get to the next objective. I do think they're cool ideas, but there's no weight to them, so it doesn't really matter how cool they are.  There's also one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who does nothing but stand around all day admonishing you for standing around when you're very clearly the only person in the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ city doing anything. ♥♥♥♥ that guy.",

This is one of the very few zombie apocalypse games that made me think twice about swinging my weapon about like a kid on a temper tantrum. You will feel like a survivor in choosing tactics, evasion and mobility over brute force.  Prior to Hard Mode being added, your character would much too quickly become a Johny Rambo one-man zombie killing machine, slaughtering thousands of infected without breaking a sweat. No more. Now you're just a fit guy with a bunch of saw blades duck-tapped to a brick hammer, and you know (magical) parkour.

There are a lot of side missions, some interesting, some not so much. I think where this really shines is at co-op.

While Dead Island drew a lot of its inspiration from Borderlands, Dying Light drew the same amount of inspiration from Far Cry 3.  It's basically an open world zombie game with parkour type mechanics for traversal. It does the parkour very well. Possibly the best of any game I've played. You have skill trees with some skills that aid your parkour and other skills that aid combat.  Combat starts off kind of difficult, then balances out, then becomes ridiculously easy. I don't have an issue with this because the change is so gradual. I felt like I achieved that power. Plus it's great to be able to fight back against certain zombies that you didn't stand a chance against earlier in the game.  Most of the quests are generic and NPCs all blend together, except for key story characters. I don't really care about that, mainly because I played through the entire game in co-op. The game was so fun to play for me, that repetitive quests were just another excuse for me to play in the sandbox. But I imagine in single player it can get pretty tedious.  Overall I'd say that if you have a friend to co-op with, this is definitely worth playing. If you're playing alone, I hope you're into zombie games or you may be disappointed.",

We were like 'Why the Hell not? Seems pretty cool.'  Then we got into the world. First of all, we were pretty amazed by the graphics in the game. We played through, and the free-running was an awesome addition to the game. For once in a game, it was okay to run from an enemy, from roof to roof escaping hordes of zombies.  And of course, the combat. You don't just have one option of combat; you can do a variety of different moves or use the environment around you to take out opponents. Not just 'grab a weapon and swing at them' like a lot of other games, but using the spikes set up around the world to impale the creatures, drop kicking them into the spikes. In some way, throwing them off roofs. As they run at you, grab them and trip them over your foot and stomp on their heads afterwards. (There's some more that I could list but I can't list them off the top of my head right now.)  The story is also pretty good, nuff said.  And multiplayer is fun. This game, I find, was good multiplayer and singleplayer, but fooling around with your friends or running from nightmares at night is probably the most fun I've had in a co-op zombie game.  8.3/10",

Pros: &gt;Grapics are excellent and extremely eye pleasing, the lighting effects are great and everything comes together well. &gt;The world is vast, but you won't get lost. After spending about a good 12 - 18 hours in this game you'll have a good part of the game memorized, although the second area is too similar looking / feeling to remember much about. &gt;I was actually scared for my life at certain points in the game, these infected aren't just here so you can mindlessly slash through them, they're hard to defeat until late into the game. &gt;The skills you aquire through all three of the main trees are extremely useful and I've actually found myself using ALL of them, I didn't just max out my trees and use two or three skills from each tree. They're all helpful and have lovely uses. &gt;The characters in side quests are pretty memorable and the dialog can be quite colorful at times. &gt;The challenges given to you in this game aren't just called 'challenges' for no reason. They're rather difficult, even some of the easy ones!  Cons: &gt;I paid $60 for this when it wasn't on sale. I have to say this feels more like a $40 game, so I'd wait until it goes on sale before buying it. &gt;The main campaign story feels a bit stupid, it's enjoyable about halfway through or so but sometimes the missions just leave you angry / frusturated. &gt;Hard mode is way too punishing for what it should be, to an extreme. &gt;Normal is babby mode easy. There is also no XP difference in any of the difficulties, making them pointless. &gt;Legend levels after a recent patch are way too hard to gain and take far too long to level. Even after about 70 hours of play I'm only almost level 9. The only way to level legend levels is to bother looking for exploits in my opinion. And this is with 3/4 skill trees maxed. &gt;On any difficulty besides Normal, deaths and playing the game are rage inducing due to slower healing, more enemy damage and more virals spawning almost at a nonstop rate. &gt;Bozak Horde, that's all I need to say.

More or less interesting story (not immune from cliches, however). Co-op is great. Online multiplayer is refreshing and fun, but tends to be one-sided depending on how many people there are on Team Humans  On the down side: The grappling hook. The damned grappling hook. Very powerful, yes, but takes almost all realism out of what is otherwise an honest Parkour system. And the second map basically requires that you use it, due to the distance between and height of buildings. The developers really did not find a novel way of enabling you to overcome the maps' verticallity. Repetition. Unlike every other zombie game ever, it gets repetitive (Wait, there's something wrong with that statement). There is the typical Left4Dead variety of zombie types, and you eventually become overpowered with an array of deadly and easy-to-acquire weapons, taking most of the difficulty out of the game.

I’m not sure if monsters level with you, the game did seem much easier when I was leveled-up.

            "review_text": "Finally completed this game, and so I've decided to give my thoughts on it finally to review it. This is ALL based on the core campaign. I have not tried Be the Zombie, and I do not have the other paid dlc.  Techland, if you remember, also made Dead Island. I tried Dead Island. I did not like it. I found the game's premise and execution silly, unimmersive and that it could not decide whether or not it wanted to be an action, a comedy or a horror game, and as a result ended up being not a single one. It became a bland amalgam of kicking infinitely with the occasional weapon thrown at zombies. It felt incomplete, it felt rushed, it felt pretty awful. NPC interactions were Skyrim/Fallout 3 level of stilted and creepy, and nothing felt natural whatsoever. The decision to avoid the question of kids entirely was not only cowardly but also terribly executed, meaning that we heard about kids in the setting, but never saw them, interacted with them, saw what could have happened. That coupled with the crippling bugs Dead Island had meant that it was in no way fun, engaging, or enjoyable for me. you can only have weapons just spontaneously vanish from your inventory a very few times before you want to throw the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game out of a window.  So when Dying Light came out, I was understandably skeptical.  I was wrong to be. Dying Light is everything Dead Island wanted to be, and even more. You can see the lessons they've learned from Dead Island in Dying Light. Its tightly coded, it runs really well (albeit very hot on my GTX 760, seriously that thing makes the card race like crazy and I'm not on high details either. Within tolerances obviously, but it makes me nervous), kicks are now balanced and not the free superweapon it was in Dead Island, the parkour is a new addition but is exceptionally well done, the sidequests and survivor events are natural and feel great, the npcs feel like actual people, and interactions with them in cutscenes and ingame dialogue are natural, weapon-play and gunplay are great fun and the few guns in the game are very well balanced, there's several lovely little comedy bits in the game to break up the rather grim storyline, and cute little easter eggs here and there as well...  As for the story, it's incredible. Government conspiracy, weapons research, a mysterious plague and less than ethical people with their own agendas running around with you stuck smack dab in the middle... a morally grey character to begin with yourself. Yes unfortunately Crane is Yet Another Straight White Male Hero, but please look past that, it's a great game and a great story regardless.  Unfortunately even Dying Light has its downsides. There's very, VERY few bugs that interrupt and cause serious problems with the gameplay. The few bugs that do exist are actually pretty hilarious (some physglitching of ragdolls and at one point I found myself able to very very easily parkour THROUGH the ceiling of an area, I screenshotted it :) ), so that's not a huge problem. However what lets the game down significantly is the final confrontation with the central antagonist of the game.  There's a lot of really excellent, really tense parkour and combat segments leading up to getting to the guy, and it's super immersive. Despite there being no timer on the screen or even mechanically in game for it, you still have a very real sense of there being a real rush to get to them before they escape, and there's some amazing pieces, where it's all under your control, and at no point do you get interrupted by a cutscene in your massive obstacle course you have to navigate.  Unnntil you get face to face with the guy. And then what do they do? It's a rather pathetically simple QTE. Here's the solution. Press S. Press D. Press W. Press A. Press S again. Hammer F. Hammer F again. Done.   That's it. That is quite literally how to win the final confrontation. It all plays out through an 'interactive cutscene' where ♥♥♥♥ing up = instant death. Mercifully it is a short segment and you don't find yourself running that whole course again, but it REALLY, REALLY takes you out of the game and after all that, you have all control and agency taken away from you as a player. YOU don't get to kill the badguy through anything but a QTE. The game 'rewards' you for doing its godawful boring QTE by killing the badguy for you in a cutscene. If you'd gotten control of a weapon or something and had to aim and pull the trigger yourself, that'd be great! If you had to work through a puzzle to stop him getting away, that'd be perfect! You'd actually FEEL like YOU beat the badguy instead of the game doing it for you as a 'reward' for completing the simplest game of Simon! to ever exist.  I was on the edge of my seat, quite literally, up until the final confrontation and hte moment I saw those button presses came up all enjoyment was just sapped away. It was pretty heartbreaking to be honest, but now that I've slept on it, I realise that Dying Light is STILL a fantastic, wonderful game, and I am VERY tempted to start the game right from the beginning again and try to get all the notes and voicemails so I can see the ENTIRETY of the story, piecing it together from little clues.  Rambling done, here's the verdict:  Story: Top notch, no complaints whatsoever, it's fantastic. It knows just when to be serious and when to lighten the mood with comedy. Characters FEEL real and natural and you get to really like a lot of them, even badguys. You even get to see your own character's growth through the story, as he goes from helping people for purely mercantile reasons to actually giving a ♥♥♥♥ for the poor people in Harran.  Graphics: Really really pretty. There is some awful textures in the game, which is a terrible shame, but in general the world is laid out really nicely and even with your 'view distance' whacked down to minimal, there is no 'pop-in' of important things like obstacles or enemies, so even on a low end rig you never find yourself running head first into a zombie that just appeared in front of you on an otherwise clear straight road. It can strain lower end graphics cards but it's still very nicely optimised. I get a solid framerate on low-medium graphics with my GTX 760 and it's a very enjoyable experience.  Difficulty: Just right. Even at the end with a max levelled character and some way OP weapons I crafted myself, large groups of infected are still a risky proposition, and the night dwelling abominations are still legitimately terrifying without being horribly overpowered and unfair. Whilst guns do attract the infected, they are still viable in certain situations and still fun to use as well, and you really do have to weigh the risk of firing the guns over their lethality. It's all very nicely balanced.  Gameplay: Really really top notch all the way up until the end where it falls short, forcing you through a QTE cutscene for the final confrontation. Up until then, the parkour is fluid and natural and easy to understand, and rapidly becomes muscle memory even after not playing it for ages, and it really does work in FPS too, much better than Mirror's Edge ever managed. Granted there's not a lot of wall running (it's a little difficult to pull off but it can be done I think), but thankfully there doesn't need to be. The grappling hook does make certain segments way easier than they should be but even that's wonderfully balanced. You got maybe 2 to 3 shots of it before you wear it out and it needs to recharge... which can get you killed if you over use it, though similarly if you are careful it can save you from a VERY nasty fall...  Overall: I'd rate this pretty highly, let down only by a godawful boring QTE cutscene for a final boss, but everything else about the game is fantastic. Numbers are meaningless but if you must have them, I'd say Dying Light gets an 8.8/10 government conspiracies. All is forgiven for Dead Island, Techland; just work on the climaxes!",

And one you are out of quests there is always challenges you can do in diffrent difficulties... too me this game has it all. Thumbs up.  In the end, the only thing it misses for it to become really realistic more than it already is, is that you must have primal needs such as hunger, thirst, sleep and the must to use a toilet once in a while and also to have slight chance to get infected wounds even if you patch it and possibilities to catch sicknesses like colds, fevers so that you have to take meds.

The Gameplay is fantastic, allowing you to climb up almost anything you want to climb, and do what you want; Do you want to run into a horde of zombies swing your Electrified Rebar around? You Can! Do you want to stick to the rooftops and gun down any enemies down below? You Can! With the wide variety of melee weapons and blueprints, you can use whatever weapon fits you, how about a Blunt Baseball Bat? No? A Sharp Machete? No? Or how about a pistol? You choose what you want to do, you can also obtain a wide variety of skills, from Drop-kicks, to making grappling hooks, to jumping on zombies heads! Overall the gameplay deserves a 10.  You can also play in Co-Op. Co-Op has you and your friends (or random people) completing the story together. Or how about being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and becoming a mutated zombie, known as a 'Volatile' invading other people's games and killing them, fitting your needs? 9 for the Co-Op.

No love lost, then, when you have to take them out.  The free-running part, almost like Mirror's Edge, but with a progression system, that let's you unlock more abilities as you progress. It's a good thing. You certainly don't want all of them at the first level, and miss out all the fun of leveling up.  Also, the fighting part. Melee all-around, a few firearms. Crafting your own weapons, using blueprints and materials scattered all over Harran. Simply beautiful.  Day and night: both have their strenghts and weaknesses. During the day, roam the streets and rooftops, searching for supplies. But come sunset, and only one word is paramount: SURVIVE. Either by sneaking around the transformed enemies, avoiding detection, or, when spotted, running like hell, your objective is to reach a safe zone, so that you may live to tell the tale. Better get ready of a few good deaths.  Last but not least, it's a compelling story of survival, and doing what's right in the midst of chaos. A few emotive elements (it was said that the main character has a problem with emotional attachment) make this game worth playing, while enjoying the story.  I like the motto of the game:  Good night, good luck . It's not just a marketing line. Around those words, there's a way of life. So you better stick them in your mind.  Welcome to Harran.

If you liked Dead Island, Mirror's Edge, or both, this is the game for you. It's more of a combination between the two, with you smashing and slicing (and sometimes shooting) your way through thousands of zombies and special infected, or running from rooftop to rooftop trying not to die. It's a ton of joy and fun to go through all this.  The one problem i did have with the game though is that it requires a GOOD COMPUTER unless you want to have horrible FPS. Throughout the game It feels like I've been playing half the speed in slow motion most of the time. Sure, It's fun to drop kick a zombie off the roof and watch him slowly fall to his death, but it's just straight up annoying at times.

There're no performance issues whatsoever, running solid 30 fps at least no crash at all on core i7 and GTX950M with maximum settings.

            "review_text": "After becoming an independent publisher, Techland's newest zombie survival game, and successor to their Dead Island franchise (now owned by Deep Silver) blows me out of the water, and is stunning both visually and mechanically. The parkour system makes a somewhat stale genre much more exciting. It adds flavor to the stale combat most games boast, and this game makes full use of it. After completing the main story singleplayer, I can say that it's one of my favorite games, and one I hope to get the DLC for.   Pros: -Amazing graphics -Parkour is insanely fun, well designed and useful -Gameplay feels nice -Inventory and collecting loot feels nice and is well designed -nice skill tree that feels good and leveling up is at a good pace -Nice variety of special infected -Steam Workshop and Custom content -Co-op (I haven't even touched it yet) -Nice story  Cons: -Gameplay may eventually feel repetetive -Normal zombies somewhat weak (could be a good thing) -I often find I don't have to fight most of the special infected due to parkour (see next paragraph) -Not many players in Be the Zombie mode (since I last played) -I didn't find myself needing to roam around much at night (thought that may just be me)  This game is amazing. It's graphics could definitely be the best for a fps game as of the time of this review, and it's new parkour mechanic is refreshing, and has even led me to search for more games like this (tried mirror's edge, but this game made it's somewhat dated parkour system and graphics feel lacking and less fluid). I often find that I run rather than fight (my personal playstyle in this game), leading me to take full advantage of the parkour system. The combat system on the other hand is still good, but it's similar to existing combat mechanics, and along with most games, it could get repetitive.  I felt the story was good, but others have argued that the Dead Island games had better, more compelling stories. The main story took me around 23 hours to complete, and there are plenty of side quests and challenges left for me to complete. In addition to those, there are custom maps and content via the Steam Workshop, many of which are very good and can easily double one's playtime (with time and an already growing community, and more importantly mapmakers of course). Overall, you will get your money's worth of playtime from this game.  The upcoming Following DLC set to release in February of 2016 looks great so far and includes improvements to the base game, both visually and mechanically. It also adds cars, but is set in 'the country,' a less populated rural area, with open fields and more dangerous enemies. While the addition of cars (and highly customizable ones at that) and a more open area, I fear that parkour will be less utilized, thought that has yet to be seen.  Sorry, if this review looked like a rant, but overall, I would rate this game a 9/10",

The NPCs are cardboard cutouts who do nothing to help you, and quest rewards are, at best, a slightly better weapon than the one you have. It will break though. All weapons break, so don't get invested in it.  All these points aside, Dying Light is fun. If you just play it for fun and see past all it tries to be, you'll have a good time. Bashing zombies with a hammer, jumping from roof to roof, leveling up and gaining new techniques... it's kind of satisfying. I don't even mind gathering ingredients to customize my weapons (and only my weapons, nothing else). Basically no character customization, save for a few different costumes.  You play as Super American who drops into Sandplace. Sandplace is infested by zombies. Oh gee, I wonder where they came from? Who cares? There's a doctor who has some kind of medicine that delays infection. So?  The story is uninspired and, frankly, boring. Same goes for jumping and climbing puzzles, that are littered everywhere, especially in side quests. When people ask you to help, there is little motivation to actually do so. Run across half the map for 25 minutes to get some XP and a semi-rare wrench? No thank you! Just roam the city, kill ♥♥♥♥ and loot.  I recommend Dying Light once the price tag goes down. Wait for a sale and have fun, play with a friend in co-op mode. Expect good gameplay, but little else.",

Running over zombies is more fun than I would like to admit. - The game is not overly frightening but the engine can randomly produce some decent jump scares  Cons - The later The Following episode had a number of 'soft' ledges where the character would miss grabbing on to something that the skin made look grabbable. This led to quite a few annoying deaths during high climbs.  - The Bozak's horde extra missions had a great idea but the save system annoyed me to the point that I decided not to finish them. - Eventually your character becomes so overpowered that killing zombies can become almost a nuisance - Besides adding missions, once a safe zone is unlocked it didn't have much more to offer than a safe place to sleep and/or sell stuff. I felt this was a missed opportunity as I would have loved to see some base building or defense elements included in the game.",

            "review_text": "This game is surprisingly good, I recommend it if youre looking for a new coop game to play with friends or just a nice open world game mixed with parkour.    Story (6/10):   While nothing special it does have its set of memorable characters. The main cast is pretty average and forgettable but the characters in the side quests are hilariously whacky and memorable.    Graphics (8/10):   The game is absolutely beautiful and has flawless triple monitor support. You can see ripples on the clothing, grass and trees moving in the wind which only gets better during raining and storming weather. The facial animations on non story critical characters are a little stiff but the animations are pretty good otherwise.     Gameplay (8/10):   The gameplay is pretty good and the parkour is pretty smooth, it may be no mirrors edge but it still boasts a lot of similar parkour. The melee combat is where the game shines with upgradable melee weapons that degrade over time, you can get perks to help make your weapons last longer but even at higher level youre still watching your melee weapon usage. The gun play is pretty good and im disappointed the guns dont wear down Far Cry 2 style but it balances out since melee weapons do more damage.  The night time can be absolutely terrifying right up until higher levels, my first experience with night time was an adrenaline rush even in coop.  The game will feel very familiar to those who've played Mirror's Edge and as a fan of Mirror's Edge, i can easily recommend this game for those looking for a new parkour game.    Controls:   I'm not giving a score on this since I played it on both PC and Xbox 360 controller controls, so I'll write a mini review for it.  The PC controls are pretty good but the mouse sensivity takes time to get used to (i really cant explain this problem) but it still feels very natural compared to most multiplatform titles. The Xbox 360 controlers however, are clunky and take a lot of time getting used to but still very playable ones used to it.    Coop (8/10):   The coop is pretty damn good, its peer2peer and you join the client's game and you do their quests and story. Its drop in and drop out so you can leave and join anytime. The 'Be The Zombie' gamemode is similar to the Dark Souls invasion and can make even the most battle hardened survivors work together. I really recommend this game if youre tired of all the current coop zombie games like CoD zombies, Left 4 Dead 2 and Killing Floor.    Technical Info:   This game isnt quite optimized for PC and my first 5-10 hours involved me having a problem where the cutscenes would run at 15fps despite pulling 40fps in triple screen resolution (5760x1080) and apparently its coming problem but looks like its fixed now (it happened to different people no matter the resolution or setup).  The game has flawless triple monitor support and the side screens darken when entering cinematics. I recommend keeping 'View Distance' at the default or turning it down because it has a major performance impact for little effect (it just makes foliage more visible in the distance, thats it).  Apparently this game has very very basic Oculus Rift support but I havent tested it until they get something worth testing.",

The thing that makes Dying Light better is the survival aspect and the difficulty you will experience in the first half of the game and during the nights when the super zombies from hell roam the streets seeking to eat you.  I have never played a game that immersed me so much in a Zombie apocalypse like this one : the zombies are really numerous, dangerous and attracted by noise, there are numerous encounters with survivors fighting zombies, selling stuff or just resting on roofs, supplies are frequently airdropped on the map containing medkits, emergency packages and flares (useful during the night) and you have to hurry to get them or the bandits will be there to take it.  I should also point out that the firearms are really more powerful and easy to use than in Dead Island, for instance a single bullet to the head with any gun will OS most of the zombies and humans you will encounter making them really useful during the day (during the night shooting will draw all the volatile's attention).  The only thing that bothered me was the story, interesting in the beginning and then really lame the more you progress in the campaign, which is quite short to be honest. On the bright side the optional quests are fun to do and compensate for the short campaign.  Runs well between 50-60 fps on my pc at almost max settings. -Nvidia Geforce GTX 770 -intel i5 2500K -12 GB RAM  Edit : Apparently the game doesn't run well on AMD yet.",

You progress your player up as you go but they do not limit the zombies you encounter or strengths of the zombies if you are low level so prepare to hit them many times before they drop. And do not get caught trying to slughter hordes and loot or they may get ya.  The crafting system is fun but one thing is i hardly ever come across the gauze but havelike 30+ alchohol. So that seems out of balance but traders do carry them at times if you are lucky.   They traders sell blueprints based on your level so as you go farther if you got a bunch of low level blueprints then you may have tp farm for higher level gear. But killing things also drops weapons and opening boxes will do the same.   All in all this game runs great and looks great and plays great i recommend it for sure.",

I bought this game about a week after its release and have loved every minute of it, from start to finish. I still cower in fear when I'm forced to go out into the lonely abyss at night though.  I have very, very little to say in terms of negativity towards this game. The only true problem it faces is that the storyline is quite short (if you play it avidly like I did, you'll complete it easily within 30 hours, side quests excluded). Once you've finished the game, I found that it lost playability by about 75%. It became a little tedious and boring, especially when I went back to side quests that featured certain characters that die later in the game. However, I do return a couple of times a week, just to disembody a couple o' zombies for my own entertainment.  Honestly, I shouldn't have to tell you to buy it. Okay, you won't get the 'dollar an hour' deal (those who are fans of Funhaus... g'day!), but, it's fun. I'd rather enjoy it and get less playability than have a huge storyline and hate it (coughWatchDogscough). Oh, and it looks incredible as well.When I bought it, I was running it at max on a GTX780. Looks exactly the same on my new GTX970, and will sure as hell be fine for anything close to either of them. Very well optimised and is one of the most incredible looking games I've ever seen.  Conclusion Buy it. Don't think twice. If you love decapitating charging zombies in super slo-mo, parkouring like that Mirrors Edge chick and feeling like a badass from your computer chair in an alternate dimension, get it. Just, don't go out at night...",

The climbing was slow along with the parkour and the swinging weapons was simple side to side with no control of variations. I understood this game to be and play like Dead Island with the fighting, no.. The freerunning like Mirror's Edge no.. but is was fantastic co op like Dead or Alive.. It turns out your climbing and fighting get better with your skills so more swinging faster climbing and more intoitive controls. The game is awsome.. I've waited 5 years is it since we first heard about it. and i love it. Go into the game knowing its not like Dead Island, Mirrors Edge at first and your experience will be much better. There has been afew glitches of stuck in ground or a hunter instantly pounce kill 3 people at the same time.. how I don't know but the online is increadablie... with friends that have it or strangers that love killing zombies. I think its a well worth $79 I paid so I can both have and play the online and co op. Dying Lights has bumped itselve up to my 2nd to third favorite of all games maybe.. It's hard to pick and compare diffrent johnras like Demon/Dark Souls/ Fallout 3/ Elderscrolls.. But for zombie Killing... It's NUMBER 1 HEAD SHOT DOUBLE KILL UNSTOPPABLE.

Perfect Example of How A poor story prevents GOTY.    ^^^ Keep an eye on Hours Played ^^^  Edit: Beat the Main story and 90% of the Side Quests in 40hrs. (66%) I'll get 100% compleation and see what happens.   The moment you see it cross 61 hours, sell your Kid's toys and buy the game. For every game I play I employ a simple method to see if the game was worth it or not: For every Dollar I spend, I expect an equal amount of gameplay hours. In this case, I spent 60 (not including the aditional 60 for my friend's copy) So I expect 60 hours of gameplay. While this may seem unfair let me point towards a few games like Skyrim ($60 -&gt; 551 Hours), Terraria ($10 -&gt; 368 Hours), Torchlight 2 ($20 -&gt; 97 Hours), and even an incomplete game like Starbound ($15 -&gt; 79 Hours) By using this I like to give games a percentage from 0% (having never played at all) to x% (seeing as The more I play a game the higher percentage)   At the Time of this Review Dying Light is at 46% (not including if I pick up the Season Pass)  Normally I would just say a resounding 'No' to anything under 50%, however It will easially break 50% as my friend and I continue to play.   Just to Clarify  0% - 50% Resounding 'No' 51% - 75% Grab it on Sale 76% - 100% Pick It up if you have some Spare Cash 100+% - Sell your children and buy the game. (Like Skyrim at 330%)  Keep In mind this is more of a system to figure out if it was really worth the money. The system isn't designed to include pure entertainment value (For example this scale doesn't really work for seeing the Grand Canyon or a Show on broadway if you like that sort of thing) You can also adjust it with diferent ratios such as 2 hours per Dollar or vice versa since 22hrs may be more than enough for some people. Anyway on to the actual review.   Gameplay:  Gameplay is the single most important thing in well. Games. It's all fine and good if you enjoy a story, but if getting from story point A to story point B is hell-and-a-half then there's no way I'm spending more than a hour playing. So far Dying Light has Impressed me with incredibly satisfying combat and movement. I need to talk about them together because without eachother we'd just be playing Mirrors Edge: Harran or Dead Island. Also note that while there isn't a direct difficulty, it seems to scale with how far you progress in the game. As we play I notice more scary zombies and the biters grab more (also more in quantity). While I like the way this is done, I feel like there isn't much incentive to play though again on 'Hardcore' mode. since it doesn't exist.     Leaping off a roof and drop kicking zombies off cliffs   Throwing a dagger at an Air Canister on the back of zombies and watching it ragdoll down the street (or right towards you) then it promptly exploding in a crescendo of red mist.    Recieving a reward for saving a survivor then watching him get jumped by 30 more zombies because he was too stupid to use the rooftops.    You and your buddy leaping to the rescue of a survior being attack by thugs (promptly knocking him off his feet) and Kicking him to death like some sort of gang initiation gone wrong, only to dissapear into the sunset like a Post-apocolyptic Batman and... Batman (no one wants to be Robin)   Realizing 'Biters' (Slow and Stupid Day zombies) Don't know how to climb down things without falling over, then promptly leading them to the edge of cliffs. I mean really, they even trip over eachother.    Filling our pants with execess weight during night missions (no really I hate-in-a-good-way the night in this game)    Laughing at the Noises the Hazmat Zombie makes. heheh toilet humor.    Anyway I could keep going. Everything (including Guns) feels incredibly Satisfying to use, zombies are fun to kill and the movement system (minus a few hiccups) is for the most part fluid and feels like you're free running.   Story:  Eh, pretty typical Zombie stuff here. Sidequests have garnered more than a chuckle from time to time.   Co-op:   See this one is important to me. I Love co-op games and honestly I think this does it in the perfect way (much like borderlands does) The Story isn't geared towards 'there's more than one of you' it's exactly the same for both of us, We're just experiencing it together. There are some minor issues with animations and I wish there were more things we could do as far as 'special zombie executing move 9000' but that's okay. The important thing everything works without much issus. Techland could go incredibly far with this, lets hope they have the sense too.   Im sick of writing this. I'll do that + and - thing everyone else did now.  +Satisfying melee and Gun combat +Wonderful movemt System +♥♥♥♥-your-pants tense night cycle +Decently Interesting Crafting System +Level as you use it Skill/Level system +Skill trees where everything is pretty useful +Lots of loot and secrets to find +Rewards Exploration +Co-op that works the first time  -Meh Story -No Moding tools -No Difficulty choices (Easy/Med/Hard) -Not enough varity of zombies (they have crazy ones, get crazier, Maybe in Expansions)    All in all it's a great game. I want it to pass my Hr/$ test. I also want them to release dev tools and say screw multiplayer (verses not co-op) I want mods. If they work on building up a Skyrim like modding community then Dying Light will be around a very long time.",

To be honest, I haven't got to play any of the Dead Island titles, and didn't expect much from a game like this as well, till I finally played it. It combines the art of survival with a huge open world concept, also with crafting and many surviving techniques. Seems to have an imposing story line but also some nice game mechanics.

This is by far, one of the best zombies games out there to date, with its gorgeous graphics and its smooth and addictive gameplay, you'll find yourself lost into the game's world for hours on end. The story may not be the greatest out there, but even with the forgettable storyline to the game, the actual zombie killing, parkour and scavenging throughout the cities is where the true beauty of this game begins to show itself. 10/10 will play this for another 1000 hours.",

Although I am not usually a fan of the First Person perspective, this game is just done right. The immersion is fabulous.  Combat just feels right, one or two zombies, no problem. Mob of 5? Pushing it a little but manageable unless you find yourself cornered or haven't planned an emergency escape route. Once you get the hang of it though Zombie killing becomes second nature. Darting through even large mobs, quickly kicking one out of your way and smashing anothers skull with your wrench just to let them know you mean buisness. The special zombies in the game also add a nice variety and more of a challange too, especially if they have a bit of a mob with them. Loud noises also attract 'Virals', Zombies on steriods, suddenly that gas bottle you just used to blow up an entire mob doesn't seem like it was such a good idea, it's best to leave the area asap or prepare for a really rough fight.  However as storylines such as the 'Walking Dead' have warned us, it may not be the dead that pose the biggest threat in an apocolypse... its other Humans.  In an open world with limited supplies its no surprise bandits are rife, a bit harder to deal with than mushy headed dead walkers. Usually out numbered the threat already feels very real, and of course with working brains and quicker reflexes they are able to evade and dodge. Taking on these guys is a frantic mele battle where reactions are essential and wits are put to the test. Take them head on or plan a more complex strategy? the open world makes the choice yours.  Then just when you think you might have got the hang of it, it gets dark. Warned in advance of the approaching gloom via your watch or your radio, you better hope you've cleared out a safe house or there's some live traps nearby because things are about to get real. Turn on your torch and attract everything nearby or stumble through the darkness hoping to stay out of sight. Virals roam freely at night, with thier cone of vision visable on your map its possible to avoid them with careful espionage-like gameplay. Get seen however and you better start running. With double XP during the night it can be fruitful to stay out past dark, providing of course you can actually evade the nighmares chasing you. Urgency and panic create a further immersion that many other survival games just don't pull off. I have yet to be invaded by another real player, though I imagine its terrifying.  The three skills trees gain XP independently and offer various paths to suit your style of gameplay. The crafting system is also fairly indepth. Modify your base weapons with elemental damage by finding weapon blueprints and crafting materials. You can also create throwables, medkits and lockpicks.  So far having a great deal of fun, worth a play for any survival/zombie fan.   I have not yet tried the Multiplayer Co-op or 'Be the Zombie', however I already feel this was worth the preorder.",

Of course this will depend on your system but its refreshing to see a PC game that looks and plays this good without any painful FPS nobbling.  Zombies litter the country side and its looks like a cool scene from The Walking Dead. With fluid maneuverability on foot and funky driving mechanics, smashing into and obliterating a zombie never felt so right. Vehicles play a part in the DLC now and the driving experience is just as satisfying, handles well and you can really blitz along the roads in the buggy's provided.  Its nice to have a game that has few and far between loading pauses, after the loading frenzy of Fallout 4 this game hardly drags you away from the tension. You can zip about through a whole district in and out of buildings, into a vehicle shoot down the road and into another built up area with fluid persistent action.   Gore is a plenty, neat zombie variation and great sound completes this extraordinary zombie experience. Craft a massive amount of weapon variations and if thats not enough throw in a mod or two (from Workshop or Nexus) and get MORE ! as modding is supported here from the go.

Alright, enough with me ranting on people who for some reason can't get it to run on their GTX 970 &amp; Fx-8350 builds.  The actual gameplay of this game so far is very pleasant. The controls are very spread out, and what I mean by that is that there is nothing like 'Press F to interact/pick up/do this/do that.' which is something I appreciate by the developers. Running, attacking, skills acquired from the skill tree, the parkour, and all that is absolutely amazing on this game. All these are required to stay alive in the game, and smoothness is almost required. I personally feel like they nailed it. As of online cooperative play, I haven't personally experienced much of it and I probably won't until a while. It works as expected, which can easily be taken for granted for, but nothing special.  The game is BEAUTIFUL. GRAPHICZ. DUH GRAPHICZ. The game does look very amazing, even on settings meant for just performance (as i mentioned, I have a CPU under the requirements) so I couldn't imagine it on max settings with view distance set to the max.  The story's alright so far. Not too much I can say about the story. So far, it's not really anything special in my opinion. It's got a bunch of side missions to do, just like Dead Island did.   Sorry for the weak review, I haven't really written a long review before and I just kind of wanted to give other PC gamers a little insight on Dying Light as it's a new release.

Now with the Following, they've given us cars that we can customize and run over zombies with. I'm cooping with my SO and his brother and it is seriously one of my favorite things we've ever played. The melee weapons are fantastic and the DLC has brought us way better guns (though I still love slashing things with machetes, personally). I love the blueprints and collectables and exploring.   There's some times the game really gets my heart pounding too. Being chased by a healthy grouping of Volatiles at night and you accidentally have molotovs keyed up instead of the grappling hook? Or there's just nowhere to run? Better pray you have a backup plan. There's some genuinely creepy and disturbing parts too.   Overall, it's a blast. It's a gory, drivey, parkoury blast.",

If it had a weak point I think it'd be the story and sometimes how it's presented, and I found the story's ending a little bit...dissatisfying. But EVERYTHING else about it is nonstop fun. Parkouring across the city or country from building to building, running and jumping and grappling is so much fun the game could just be that and I think I'd love it, but then you have awesome fighting mechanics that make the decapitation, dismemberment and immolation of enemies so fun you'll giggle like a maniac.   Now with the Following, they've given us cars that we can customize and run over zombies with. I'm cooping with my SO and his brother and it is seriously one of my favorite things we've ever played. The melee weapons are fantastic and the DLC has brought us way better guns (though I still love slashing things with machetes, personally). I love the blueprints and collectables and exploring.   There's some times the game really gets my heart pounding too. Being chased by a healthy grouping of Volatiles at night and you accidentally have molotovs keyed up instead of the grappling hook? Or there's just nowhere to run? Better pray you have a backup plan. There's some genuinely creepy and disturbing parts too.   Overall, it's a blast. It's a gory, drivey, parkoury blast.",

It dropped in price pretty quick with a sale, and i bought it. It didn’t hit the news very big when it sold, a lot to do with not enough room in the spotlight. I thought it was amazing.. and the story is quite long. If you ran through on Normal difficulty (easiest) and did only the main quests.. you could do it somewhat fast(but still longer than most current campaigns). Hard difficulty with the side quests makes it a huge game. I thought the first city was it, but no, there is another city.  This game won me over immediately by the Open World aspect and for how amazing the smooth multiplayer 4 coop, sign in, sign out is. I would give this game a 9/10 And awesome coop If you like Parkour, Zombies or RPG/open world(like assincreed or spiderman), then this game will be great in those.  For THE FOLLOWING a... 9/10, must play (if enjoyed the orginal game). They added a lot of things, not half %&amp;# for the cash in DLC unlike a lot of current games. They scaled it much harder for the already super +100 hour grinder RPGer fans they had. They added a new “Legend” tree(as basic as it is, just for scaling dmg stats) along with a Car, in the open fields to drive, with a skill tree for driving/mechanics. And a few new monsters, with bosses. Another large landscape to traverse. The story is enticing... not Super, but good.",

Having time to reflect on the experience I can say that it was very immersive and would say its the next level of games. I'm 33 and started playing at CounterStrike 1.6 so I've played more games then I'd like to admit. The story starts off with a creative entrence to the infected area, from there you learn different skills to taking down your adverseries and completing tasks or quests if you'd like to call them that. Some games the tasks seem very tedious but this game not so much. Any where you go the park core skills make your travels fun and enjoyable. The 1st half of the game I was grinding through leveling skills, doing side quests, and enjoyed every main story line there was. The park core element of the game made you feel like there were not map restrictions like with most games, you could climb go run anywhere you want, which ultimately helped you feel like you were immersed in a story and not playing a game. The 2nd half of the game introduced some new very exciting elements being in more of a urban london type feel setting, by then you should be a master at taking down your foes. Some of the quests you get sent on start to get a little tedious but they arn't to bad. Most of the leveling that affects your play style happens in the 1st half. On a scale of 1 to 10 rating the 1st 1/2 of the game id give it a 9/10, the second half I'd give a 5/10. The ending was perfect although bitter sweet and I wish the experience would continue. Looking back this is definitly a buy and I would recommend this as a first person shooter with fun and interesting story line. if you like zombie books like World War Z you will love this game.",

Also parkour, if you like it its got it. Run from rooftop to rooftop and vault over obsticles its great. However if you are expecting an easy game that takes absolutely no effort then dont get this game. There is also a really cool multiplayer that lets you be the zombie and hunt down other people. Its nice not to be afraid of the dark as a zombie and fun to be the bad guy sometimes, but good friggen luck trying to get into a match. I spent 2 hours trying to get into a match to try out the multiplayer, i managed to get into 3 games. Even though i managed to get into 3 games, they couldnt have been worsely chosen. The first one wasnt so bad i did manage to kill a guy once but thats about it. The second game the 2 people hide in their safehouse untill i got an empty victory. Finally the third match i had to hunt someone down who wasnt a coward, in fact he was so absoluely not even bothered by my presence he was hunting me. The reason is because the game thought it would be awesome to match me with someone who was maximum level, where as this was only my second real match and i was lvl 2. It was pathetic, running for my life when im the hunter, not exactly what id call fun. Anyways enough complaining. The game is still awesome and i love it, it has a good story and great gameplay i still recommend it. I think ill stick to invading my friends games only though because at least ill actually get to do the chasing. Good hunting.",

Also, rewards are doubled for surviving outside during the night, which is highly rewarding if you managed to do quests. + Kicking zombies of rooftops, stairs, bridges and other high area's is incredibly satisfying. + The story has moments where you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, sad and laugh as the character does.  - There are some graphical bugs where you glitch through certain objects, which makes the experience a bit less real. - Your grappling hook is rather bugged and at times will attach to something invisible or will shoot you in the wrong direction. - You need to look at EACH ledge as you try to grab them, not looking at the ledge means: no grab = fall to you death and can cause quite the amount of rage now and then. - sometimes doesn't grab the ledge even when directly staring at it. (more rage material) - Once you reach higher level's and the weapons become increasingly strong, normal zombies are no longer scary as you cut them down with 1 maybe 2 cuts/hits of your weapons. - 'be the zombie' mode is currently broken and needs to be fixed.  Overall I give the game a 8/10 and highly recommend playing it. Despite the slight bugs here and there and the 'be the zombie mode' not working properly the game is insanely fun and the co-op mode is incredibly satisfying, especially when playing with friends.  Tl;DR:  Game is insanely fun, has amazing graphics, good story line and character development along with a satisfying co-op mode and despite some bugs here and there and a 'be the zombie' mode that still needs some adjusting the game is incredibly satisfying to play and would highly recommend purchasing it.",

However halfway through the game, or even before that, the charm starts to wear off. I mean, its all still fun... but it got too easy. The enemies don't really get stronger, so eventually you become this god amongst men. I personally still found the game enjoyable even until the end, but I can see where some people would have issues with the way the game turned out.  Then there's the multiplayer, the coop was alright. You got to play everything you could alone, but with pals. Of course, this only compounded the whole issue with the game being easy, because I didn't see any kind of added difficulty when playing with other people.  There was also a versus, where 1 player controlled super zombie fought against up to 4 player controlled humans. I don't really know what to say about this. It was unbalanced. The matchmaking was terrible. But once again, I actually really liked playing as the hunter zombie. The main issue being how hard it was to actually find a match. I'm guessing there were many more zombie players looking for matches than vice versa. This ended up in 10+ minutes of refreshing and hoping you join a game before someone else steals the spot.  But I digress. Great game, few flaws. I got my moneys worth. 8/10",

It makes the game playable until techland gets it all together.   All in all I'd recommend the game, running around and climbing and killing zombies is fun and feels good to do, if you don't blow your money you can always have top tier weapons that will have the best upgrades. The weapon system is really neat and since I didn't play dead island I don't have comparison. Far Cry 3 with good zombies and better physics is right.Furthermore, the zombies really try their best to get at you but can easily fall over and it's really fun to watch zombies fall off buildings and or just fall over period. And then you get to come in and just kick them like your some Yakuza member until they die.  Against humans you have to be relentless AND tactful, they will block and that degrades your weapons. Kick as they attack and then swing. Or use shrapnel grenades, they will kill a group in 7 seconds due to bleeding from one grenade. Don't use bullets except for the giant zombies, they are more worth your time because otherwise you WILL go through at least 2 medkits fighting them.  In conclusion, I'd recommend to buy if you enjoy running around and exploring and getting slowly more and more powerful. Would not recommend if you want a highly streamlined or directed gameplay experience, or very very good forced platforming sections.      Take your time on those   ",

Alas, it is a survival horror game so I guess that makes sense. I've only found two different types of pistol not including an easter egg quest and just two types of rifles and one single shotgun type.   2) There are also no customizables for the rifles weapons or such things.   3) I kind of wish they added an ability/shopkeeper that could make your weapon permanant but cost a bit to regain the repair slots.  4) Sometimes the grapplehook says you can grapple to a ledge but the ledge can't be shimmied across or even climbed. I've died more to that than anything else in the game I think.  All of the above are not close enough to take away from the game as a whole though, they are but mere personilization ideas that would have made the game perfect for me.

The way that the charecters actually have an affect on you is just amazing and the way you feel about the villians make you want to see it through to the end.  ========= GAMEPLAY: ========= The game run at a smooth 30-60 fps constantly and it feels like a polished game that has alot of potential and took that chance. ======== GRAPHICS: ======== The game runs and looks amazing. But some settings drop the framerate by about 15 fps even with VSync off! Ambient Occulsion makes the game drop 15-20 fps. But even if thats turned off, the game drops fps in lots of areas around the map. My computer specs are: Intel i7 4970k 3.6Ghz Nvidia GTX 745M 4G VRAM 24G DDR3 RAM 2TB HDD But still the game looks great none the less! I give this game a 10/10 this game is amzaing and runs fluently and smooth,  ",

I have not yet tried the mutliplayer portion of the game but i am looking foward to it and hope that it makes the game much more fun than it already is. From my experience so far i enjoy the game and i do recommend it. Dying Light is rather exciting when night comes around and just trying to escape is a thrill all on its own. Fighting is difficult because weapons do eventually began to break so it requires you to pick your fights, not to mention once you start fighting one zombie it usually attracts a horde. I really do recommend this game for anyone that is into killing zombies and lots of parkour, this however is my own opinion of the game itself since i know not everyone will enjoy it as much as me. I hope that anyone that buys this game will also have as much fun as i have been having. :D",

They are actually terrifying, one of them is no problem, but they react to noises and it's easy to attract a group.  &gt;&gt; Actors are well done and not overly-campy.  &gt;&gt; Seems to have a really good crafting and leveling system, reminds me a lot of the Fallout/TES games the way you want to find everything you can.   &gt;&gt; Enviroments are well done, but due to the scope of the city I've already seen some rooms that are carbon copies of each other without even being too far apart.

There is also nice amount of crafting inside the game but it could have been more indept. A lot of people complain about melee system being a lot like Dead Islands. Well first off the game was made by the same developers + in my opinion there is nothing to complain about it. One thing which the developers should look at is the fact that you can´t upgrade your weapons or add attachments like silencers or sights into weapons.   PERFORMANCE:  At launch the game was horribly optimized. Specially on AMD systems. I had 20-30 FPS on ANY settings at launch (7970 GHZ) even setting resolution to lower didn´t change FPS. Also the film grain effect also annoyed many people. I didn´t mind it. After recent patch I can run the game at 50-140 FPS (max settings except view distance which destroys frame rate). Techland also added setting to remove the film grain many people complained about.   If you like zombie games I think Dying Light is really good choice. Though if you aren´t that huge fan of zombie games I recommend you to wait till the game goes on sale.",

            "review_text": "I loved DL. I really did. And I'd recommend this game to anyone. I'm not going to talk about what makes DL great, you either like it or you don't. I do want to spend a little time talking about some of the things I personally feel would have made DL a much better game;  Weapon Blueprints: Pretty restricting, especially at first. For about 10 hours (I spent a lot of time exploring/looting) The only things I could really mod at a rare level was knives. (I know the basic level mods could mostly be used on any melee weapon). I also disliked that it was possible to obtain duplicate blueprints.  Weapon Customisation: Pretty simple honestly. I do feel as though the system was about on par (If not a little worse) than Dead Island. There was nothing too special about it. Certainly didn't bring anything new. I feel the opportunity was certainly there to do more.  Ranged Weapon customization: Why isn't there any? The world was full of loot, something a little dayZ-esque would have been amazing. By this I mean, why not add different types/quality of gun components to be looted within the world. Foregrips, buttstocks, silencers, mags of varying sizes, different scopes. The ability to craft different ammo types. Anything that could alter the way your guns behaved to add more fun and variation to gun gameplay.  Skill Tree: Mostly pretty decent if not a little basic, but there was nothing for ranged weapons at all. Could definitely have added something. I don't like the fact that the option to pick up every single skill existed. More skills would have added a sense of choice, or at least the ability to enhance certain aspects of the way you play. More one hand skills, more two-hand skills, etc. This would have given a more in-depth choice to the player on the style they wanted to play.  Looting: Loads of loot in the game, but honestly once you're done you realise it's mostly pointless. I ended the game with a huge excess of random craft components that I had no use for at all. I partly feel that several issues are to blame for that. (Lack of gun customisation, pretty average and lazy weapon modding/customisation etc). You're far better off looting for what you need. Looting for the sake of looting is pointless.  Game balance: Honestly a little weird. Once as I bought myself a decent legendary quality weapon, threw in three mods and crafted it into a rare level (Or higher) elemental weapon, the toughest infected in the game died in two hits. It stayed this way for a great deal of level ups, so I only really crafted new weapons with higher damage for the sake of owning a weapon with bigger numbers. I didn't need it. It also made two-hands a little pointless save for the unique techniques you learned for them. Which weren't really needed because again, two attacks and dead.  Optimisation was, at times, pretty horrible (By now everyone knows this). I run an I75820k and two GTX980's with 16gb DDR4 OC'd at 3666hz. Spitter bombs actually crashed my game at least half a dozen times, if it didn't crash It would slow down to a crawl for a few seconds.  Great game though, i thoroughly enjoyed DL (Mostly because of my love for Zombie games!). But it was honestly good fun. Some epic moments, some epic side quests. Story was really good, wish there was more of it. I might seem harsh on the game but it's only because while I loved it, I believe there could have been *so* much more.",

It makes sense when you play the game.  Here are some of my grading criterias:  Performance: I ran on the lowest settings possible. I don't have the best rig as I'm running on an Asus N56V laptop but it still runs at 60fps for the most part. Smooth gameplay. This may be subjective since I've read that a lot of other people are experiencing performance issues with their gaming rig for some reason. One being that they have an AMD gpu.  Gameplay: Fairly solid. The progression is at a pace where the player is never really overpowered at any given moment. I haven't reached endgame content but special zombies and bandits are almost always dangerous.  Only complaint I have is that some weapons are survivor level locked. This means that I can't use certain weapons until I have reached a certain level which ruins some of the realism but I can understand the rationale.  Random events that the player encounters are exciting at first but it gets a bit stale after seeing the same random event for the 5th or 6th time.  Graphics: I don't give a ♥♥♥♥. Its pretty but I wish I could tone it down more so I can run the game faster. But it hardly affects my game.  A must buy? Hmmmm....I'll think on it. It's definitely a must have but is it worth the $60 I just spent? That's a tough question. (I get bored easily)  It definitely is a premium release game. If the gameplay trailers here on Steam are appetizing to you, then go for it. Techland delivers all it has promised but not *every* single building is accessible. Which disappointed me somewhat.

As for the story, i'm still didnt progress that far but it's not half bad. You are a secret agent who has been sent to take back some stolen info about the cure for the zombie virus and end up getting stuck with the survivors in the country.  The Multiplayer is simple yet fun to play, YOU can either play as a human from the Story-Mode and work with your teammates to destory the zombie spawning points as fast as possible.  OR you can play as a zombie ( Spider Zombie actually ) who has Spiderman's powers to hunt down every human you find to keep your zombie spawning point safe.   The performance is A LOT better than Far Cry 4 and Assassin's Creed Unity in release, Just like any game- you need to tweak your graphic/ video settings for the best performance for your hardware.  i am using an old set and yet the Graphics and Performance were amazing even after turning off Antialising.

I could never imagine doing that on any other Zombie game (I have come close on a few)  The game concentrates heavily on a mixture of free running and melee combat with a few missions that require some FPS action(not bad at all). The story is a good one with surpisingly great voice acting. It will however leave you wanting more.   If you do try it out I suggest delving in to the side missions as soon as possible and do everything you can to bulk it out a little by doing so you actully learn more about the back story of the outbreak and Harran itself. Enjoy the combat and enjoy climbing high things then jumping to your almost certain death if it were not for some oddly placed garbage piles that only contain soft, fluffy, safe garbage.

            "review_text": "Seamlessly blending survival, action, horror, exploration, story-driven progression, and RPG elements - Dying Light is a game that has the potential to make you feel like a kid again. I'm about halfway through the story, I've experienced luring dumb zombies into traps by day and running from insanely fast and agile terrors by night. This game feels like several different types of games/genres which are flawlessly blended to create an immersive experience unparalleled.  I could not stand Dead Island, which was made by the same company. Dying Light makes Dead Island look like they were either trolling people, or weren't sure what type of game they wanted to make at the very least.  I never looked forward to this game, didn't know anything about it. I got the demo because I could. Played it, and was immediately blown away. Bought the game on sale and never regretted it. I'm about 63 hours in so far and only '53%' through the main story. Also, and I won't mention this much because the gameplay is so solid, but the graphics are insane and very impressive.  Since I've owned it now they have released an enhanced edition (for free) which adds 'new levels' more or less and other enhancements. Just as I thought the game was getting a little easy, (keep in mind there is a learning curve which I have really mastered with the Steam Controller which makes me feel like somewhat of a badass), the next town over provided a sobering challenge that left me frantically fighting to survive at times like I was brand new at the game. I also enabled the new Nightmare mode which made even the weakest zombies a real challenge.  I have not even made it as far as The Following yet (the massive expansion) and I really look forward to it. This game continues to be fun as hell and blow me away. Every positive review you see is there for a reason. Get the demo if you have doubts, and get the game otherwise. It's even more fun with friends, and I've played most of the game solo and STILL had a roller coaster of a good time.  It's first person, parkour (free-running), zombie, action, stealth, rpg, open world, day/night cycle, exploratory fun. Other than that, it's hard to describe exactly how immersive it is. You should have already played this by now. The day/night cycle adds a great deal of depth and immersion, and if you're caught outside goofing around at daytime and scavenging as night descends and you're unprepared, the entire game turns upside down as you desperately scramble and fight for your life to make it to the nearest safehouse. Or you play it smart and lucky and sneak around, hoping and praying you don't make too much noise.  Just play it already, even if it's the demo. GIve it a shot. It's too much fun not to try.  Edit: Wifey reminded me to mention that they released a companion app for Android / iOS where you can manage sending squads into the city to loot and rescue survivors and such. It's a fun side-mission companion app that allows you to send items aquired to your character in the PC game to use. I've never seen this level of interactivity in a game before, and I rarely see this kind of dedication (overall) from developers. Techland, effing bravo.",

You also don't want to cause explosions when zombies are nearby as that will alert them to your presence.  There are missions during the night too which changes the experience from just day missions as you can go around during the day sticking to rooftops &amp; mainly avoiding the zombies.   but at night these super powered zombies are around &amp; will actually chase you so if you go out at night to venture off into either retriving an air drop or anything else you may need so it actually turns into a sneak game to make as little noise as possible because if you get spotted prepare to run your ♥♥♥ off to lose them.  I haven't played it long but I still enjoy every minute I play it. Co-op is also awesome too as you can set up competions as the host of the game so if you have to save a survivor you can make it a competition between you &amp; your buddy.  I can't recommend this game enough to people who have played Dead Island as it has the Dead Island vibe but is also unique in it's own right.

(PC port issues aside) - Great map  - Random encounters are rather interesting at times - Good loot system - Good combat, if punishing. - REALLY fun change of dynamic in the night time. Very scary. Adrenaline fueled.   CONs - At the time of writing, the PC port gets weird frame drops (in some cases, the fps is literally halved) because of view distance. This is corrected by turning view distance all the way down, but the difference is so minimal I didn't care about having to do so. - The story is ♥♥♥♥♥, as is the norm with zombie games surely. If you're looking for an in depth and unpredictable story, you've come to the wrong game. - Like I mentioned earlier, this game is PUNISHING. I say this only from a single player perspective and not co-op, but man, this game can be extremely, extremely difficult when faced with even a small group of slow-♥♥♥ zombies, nevermind the various other 'types'. - Main campaign is too short. I am nearly at the end of the main story, BUT I have only just started doing side quests. ----------------------------------------------------------  Really, this game is a Dead Island with parkour; the difference being that it WORKS, unlike its spiritual predecessor. It's a solidly put together game with few technical flaws, at least on my end. The fact is, it is one of the most punishing zombie games I have played and I don't know whether to put that down to the fact I am bad at it or that I am playing single player. At full price, I would say only get it if you truly truly love zombie games. Come a sale, I would say yes undoubtedly. I am going to tag this with a Recommended, but definitely a weak one.",

The game is very short but 100's of side quests on the way. I know after you beat the campaign there is a way just to free roam, but I have not figured it out to be honest, so I stick with the 2nd to last level. The whole campaign (Besides the intro and first very short mission) is a free multiplayer campaign. I personally choose to play the campaign with friends (more fun) But if you don't choose to entirely fine with me I don't care just an opinion.

Coming from an FPS veteran who cut his teeth on Wolfenstein 3D and has played almost every FPS since, I can unreservedly recommend this. If you enjoyed Dead Island, this is a very similar, albeit FAR superior game. This doesn't have nearly the same comic-book feel to it, and the graphics are impressive.  Pros:   Free-running/parkour - this is done very well - not frustrating and clunky like Assassin's Creed, and it's also not a 'can't miss' QTE either. You're not a superhuman, and it IS possible to miss ledges/grabs/balances - however, this is largely due to player skill, not any form of bug. The free-running/mantling aspect is handled fluidly, and lends a sense that your body actually has some weight to it - it takes some skill, it's not just a matter of 'look at the grapple point, press a button, automatically teleport there with an animation'. Very life-like.  Graphics - high resolution, well put together. Not quite on the level of the new Frostbite engine, but very good - no complaints here.  Gameplay - if you liked Dead Island, you'll like this. Very similar. Crafting weapons, primarily melee-based, gather supplies/blueprints, special Giant Zombies etc.. Like another reviewer mentioned, the difference here is they focus more on the horde-mechanic, as opposed to a lot of individual encounters. Thus far, they definitely incentivize the free-running, think smart aspect as opposed to blithely wading into an encounter with your trusty rusty pipe.  Cons - The buildings and locales are all very similar. This could be because I'm primarily still in the early portion of the game, however I did enough side-exploring to see what the city offered. Not a lot of variants that I could see - mostly a favela-looking jungle of shanties. Not necessarily a bad thing, but also won't blow you away with variety.   9/10 - Simply put, if you liked Dead Island and want something slightly less comic-bookish, this is the game for you. It's basically Dead Island with free-running, but much, much better put together and less clumsy. ",

The parkour element makes this game stand out from the rest. Also, gameplay at night is intense and very fun. Also, muliplayer events and co-op makes the game even better. Overall, if you are a Dead Island fan, it is worth paying $60. If not, wait for this one to drop at a steam sale.",

GTX 970 bad reviews? It's not Dying Light's fault that max textures causes stutters.   Save game checkpoints? Inconsistent. You see the savegame icon, quit, and half the time you log back in somewhere completely different. Absoultely annoying. Safe houses should be automatic checkpoints if you exit the game. Otherwise...  Brilliant game. I won't really review it like everyone else has. I was on the phone, so I decided to just climb up high and look around while blabbing... watched the sun set, not so spectacular, but after night falls, watching the surrounding cities light up and watching the moon traverse over the sky... was incredible. Some of the views are just spectacular.   All sorts of main and side missions, or you can just wander about and explore. After they fix the bugs and optimization problems, this will likely be game of the year or at least runner up. lol One of the best titles to have come out in the last couple of years.  Weapon durability is kind of a joke on some items. Hammers are way too easy to break. Don't buy a hammer IRL or you'll be suprised that they're actually incredibly difficult to break.    ",

And no, this isn't some ♥♥♥♥-take review; this game is absolutely fantastic. I give it an  8.5/10   9.5   because of the performance issues that everyone has been encountering. It is an issue that needs to be addressed by the devs, but I've managed to fix some of it and play through it  (the issues were resolved). However, THIS is the zombie game we needed instead of some WarZ, H1Z1, early access pile of ♥♥♥♥♥. I was happy to know that our friends over at Techland were developing it and they did not disappoint. Visuals are quite impressive, even at the lowest settings, though I would like to see some more customization for video options.  As for the story, the position of the main character caught me off guard, which grabbed my attention and immersed me into the story, as well as the game itself  *BUT THE ENDING IS TERRIBLE*. The combat and parkour are both brilliantly-made systems. There are, however, a few bugs to work on with the parkour system, such as climbing at JUST the right spot to ping yourself into space or under the map. But it's hard to be mad at these bugs because they're hilarious and you might not run into them that often. In summary, definitely pick it up and tinker with the game and try to get the frame-rate at a comfortable place and just play through the lag because it's worth it.",

            "review_text": "After just completing the story I recommend this game for many reasons but here are a few. First off is the parkour, it is a very sort of playground type parkour with a good skill tree to further enhance your fun such as dropkicks, rolls, and the good ole shoulder bash from Sam B himself. Melee combat in Dying Light has been revamped since their release of Dead Island. A whole new physics remake makes it feel satisfying when you get that hit on a zombie that pops the skull. However, if your fighting humans the melee system can be a lot trickier. They can block your attacks often (sometimes even throwables!) they can dodge kick etc. Now onto my favorite part, the story of this game. I will be sure to include no spoilers as I have just completed the game. It is a very well done story that can keep you captivated. I often found myself being drawn to story missions rather then as something I had to do to progress. The people you meet, tasks done are interesting and overall fun. There are even some humorous spots around. Now the heart and soul of Dying Light, the zombies. No one is quite sure where it came from but some interesting side quests do have theories. Dying Light got their zombies right the first time you see a new zombie it should really make you jump. Take the volatiles for example my first glance at one scared me real bad. Like heart pounding. I was terrified to be out at night alone. Eventually I had to and I was still scared. The zombies can be quite entertaining during the day however, watching them flop around. But just remember this game is entitled Dying Light. Which brings me whimpering to the next topic, coop. Coop is a fun thing to me, I have and always will love coop in free roam games. Coop can be used as a therapy for fear. Grab a couple of buddies and from a raiding group to travel at night. Raiding not your thing? Try challenges to add to the mix to keep the competition up. When you've experienced the fear from first seeing a zombie that is probably gonna make you scream and cry.Repeatedly. Coop will help you overcome that fear. Dying Light for me is a fun game, it can keep you entertained with it's rapid parkour and combat while keeping you intertwined with the story and many fun side quests which includes fetching coffee, crayons, and even gathering stuff at night. Don't forget Jeff's crazy idea 'The Apocalypse Wall.' I like Dying Light it brings to light some new and interesting mechanics (see what i did there) and a great storyline. Definitely worth a try to pick up and play if you get the chance.",

            "review_text": "What an awesome game Dying Light is.   Note: Haven't played The Following yet.   Dying Light takes place in a fictional place called Harran with there being two areas, the Slums and Oldtown/Sector 0. You play as Kyle Crane, voiced by the wonderful Roger Craig Smith (also does the voice for Sonic). Crane is a GRE operative sent to Harran the investigate the situation there and find a man named Rais. Now that we've got that, it's time for the pros and cons of Dying Light (in my opinion):   Positives: - The parkour elements are very well executed and work great in the enviroment. You can climb up almost everything. - The areas you play through are immersive, detailed, and, like I said, nearly everything can be climbed up or on. - The melee combat is incredibly satisfying and smooth. - There are lots of items that can be picked up and can be crafted into something else. - There are lot of side quests to keep you busy all throughout the game. - All of the skills on the skill tree don't feel useless and the leveling up in general is very well-done. - The game performs pretty well and has a decent amount of graphics options (including an FOV slider). - Most of the special enemies are cool looking and challenging to fight. - Playing through the night is a very interesting gameplay mechanic because the enemies get tougher and very difficult to kill enemies come out. Surviving a night rewards you with a huge XP bonus. - The finale of the game is very fun.   Negatives: - Although the story isn't that bad, it's still kind of lackluster with not many characters getting any attributes or traits associated with them. - The game does perform well but there are some random drops in performance in certain parts of the base game areas. - The gunplay doesn't feel right and it isn't very fun to use guns. - SPOILERS FOR THE END OF THE GAME:  The ending of the game is unsatisfying due to the QTE sequence that's used to kill Rais. It would've been more fulfilling if we were actually able to fight him.     Nonetheless, Dying Light is an incredible game if you're a fan of the survival horror/zombie game genre. I strongly recommend the game to anyone who likes zombie games or Mirror's Edge as the parkour in Dying Light feels on-par with it.",

            "review_text": "The Parkour: Really gives you that freedom of movement. The game is in first-person, and therefor there are no need for any player animations, which allows for much more diversed movement. Assassin's Creed is way too squared, as you can only jump/climb in eight different directions around you, and the parkour is very controlled by the game. You don't do much yourself, other than pushing some buttons. In Dying Light, on the other hand, you are moving freely around everywhere, so you have to watch your step. It's brutal and unforgiving, and that's what makes it so exciting. You never get bored of it!  The combat is pretty straight-forward when it comes to swinging your weapons, but you do have a lot of awesome body-attacks like jump-kicks and dodges and the like that are real fun to use, as well as effective. It does make the combat a bit tactic. You make a wrong move, you end up getting caught under a pile of zombies. The weapons are really creative, awesome and MANY. Looting is something you'll need to do constantly because you need items for repairing your worn weapons, and to create different things like molotovs and medkits. But that's okay, because the looting is pretty fast, and so is the lockpicking.  The enemies are frightening at first, but as you progress, they become easier to defeat, which gives you that awesome 'I-was-afraid-of-you-before-but-now-I-kill-you'-feeling. And yet even after that, you still keep a certain level of fear for your enemies because you want to fight as little as possible so you can conserve your supplies and weapons for when you really need them. This game is, as I said already, brutal and unforgiving; the more you do, the more skillpoints you earn, but you also lose a lot of skillpoints almost every time you die. That is one thing that actually makes you afraid of dying in this game, and that is great.  The story is maybe a bit far-fetched. It's not as simple as just surviving the zombie apocalypse. Apparently this story involves trying to find the cure, and resisting the government who wants to exploit the virus to make the apocalypse even worse. Never the less, it is a very exciting story that gives you a feeling of importance. Animations and voice-actings are very good, and the characters have very strong characteristics. Especially the villain, of course.  All in all, I liked the game a lot. But like most other open-world games I've played, I don't really feel like exploring the world that much, as almost everything gets slightly repetitive. I'm mainly in it for the storyline. Despite enjoying the game, I had this really uncomfortable and scared feeling throughout the whole playtime of 19 hours that it took me to complete it. It was like 'Damn, I want to just get done with this story so I can stop playing this game', and I'm not really sure. Still, a great game.  Oh, and... DON'T. GO. OUT. AT. NIGHT.",

Graphics are also amazing, When you're standing with the main character Kyle Crane on a crane and have the overview of Harran you will love it.   Storywise it was also great. I got disappointed in one stage though because something happened that didn't make any sense. That thing made me slightly annoyed of the story. If the devolopers made us able to choose what to do in some parts of the game it would have been much better. Most zombie games makes zombies annoying objects, that doesn't have much to do with the game at all. But Dying Light gives you the opposite.   However, they did a great job overall and I hope for a sequal, DLC or another similar game like this in the future. Because the parkour and combat are amazing.  Good Night. Good Luck.

            "review_text": "Revising from my previous review. This is a rather qualified recommendation that may change when The Following is release.  TL;DR: An intriguing, occasionally-frustrating take on the zombie theme. Focusing on first-person parkour and melee combat, and transforming into a wonderfully tense stealth game at night. Plenty of collectibles, challenges and sidequests for the open-world enthusiasts. Some frustrations with the main story and certain gameplay elements keep this title from earning a solid recommendation (one of those times you wish Steam had more than a Yes/No). It's definitely worth trying out the demo.  GAMEPLAY: The melee combat feels a LOT like Techland's previous work in Dead Island, and is broken up by the occasional ranged battle. The parkour seems mostly inspired by Mirror's Edge, but with clumsier controls. When you're in the open world, they function well enough, but always seem to fall short when needed most. The game seems to like to hide instant-death Boomer-style exploding zombies right behind corners, often resulting in frustrating deaths that highlight some poor decisions in checkpoint placement. An end-game gauntlet that kicks you back to its start led to my earlier, angrier review and to a multi-month surrender of sort. The game also likes to take away your gear (grappling hook, health packs, weapons) right before throwing its hardest bosses at you. These attempts to increase tension often only result in needless frustration.  However, the game truly shines at night. By combining crippling darkness with Volatiles- a fast, durable, hard-hitting kind of super zombie- Techland manages to transform this brawler into a stealth game. While there are safe zones all across the map, you earn extra XP for spending the night wandering around in the darkness, and even more XP for evading these Volatiles completely from dusk to dawn. These are my favorite parts of the game.  Also, as mentioned, the game has plenty to offer for achievement hunters. Safe spots to unlock, collectibles to track down. Plenty of side missions and challenges will keep you busy stomping thru (or sneaking around) zombies. These kind of things are what really drove me to finally come back, beat the main story, and get back to open world stuff.  STORY: A fairly forgettable affair. You come in as some government agent invesigating a possible cure. There's a mouthy raider boss claiming to know secrets about the cause of the outbreak trying to leverage this against said goverment. Characters are mostly forgettable, and you never really delve into their backstories. Side quests are fairly generic. At least the voicework isn't too bad.  GRAPHICS: A fairly technically-impressive game. I can run it quite well on an FX-6300 and R9-380 4GB with 8GB of ram. Thankfully, the motion blur that mired Dead Island can be switched off, and the FOV can be adjusted to one's liking. The game's color palette is mostly drab, tho I suppose that's befitting of a zombie outbreak. Ragdoll and clothing physics on the zombies is done well, and if you're into gory melee combat, few do it better than Dying Light. Interiors also allow for a degree of destrucitibility, with bits of drywall and broken glass often flying about during the game's few gunfights. The lighting is, oddly enough, most impressive at night, where barrel fires and what few lights still work help outline the intense shadows and roving Volatiles.  SOUND: As mentioned, the voice work has been done fairly well, but effects are where it's at here. Cutting up zombies is as much an aural experience as it is a visual one. Guns give out satisfying reports with each carefully-placed shot. The ambient audio can be nice, but the sound can also mislead at times. You'll hear a distant horde cry out in response to some careless noise, but they may never actually show. I turn the music off most of the time, but it has a bit of an Asian flare and isn't awful - I just think turning it off makes the nights that much better.   In the end, we'll see how the buggy-focused Following DLC pans out. I may be able to give the game a little more favor then. Still, it's worth a try for the zombie-slayers out there.",

Pros: +Great Story line, a bit slower in the middle but overall wonderful. +Movement system is quite fun, you can really tell that they put a great deal of work into it. +Gore looks amazing and the stamina system put in place is a fair one. +Mostly a melee game, gives you a real sense of a 'post apocalyptic' metropolis. +Map design is on spot.  Cons: -This game is VERY demanding and it feels very poorly optimized(Running a 5820k OC'd with a raedon 295x2), 40-50fps(if lucky) -There is currently NO support for crossfire what so ever, with this there is often in peoples games a 'tearing' or 'stuttering' effect, which can be eliminated if the other GPU is turned off(for the most part). -There is really no choice based system in this game so it makes the replayability factor a little bit lower to me.  AMD users, if you DO NOT currently have a flagship/top of the line GPU wait. I know you all want to play this game, but with its current optimization and lack of a new driver from AMD the game really isn't what it should be. I urge you to wait for a driver update and then I will update my review and let you know.  Rollback drivers? Did not have an effect upon gameplay at all. 14.9 was virtually the same.

This is the game I wish Dead Island had been. Combat is fluid and fun, and the zombies are incredibly realistic. I've heard zombies splatter to the ground who had tried chasing me off a roof, I've seen them mantle with their torsos onto the floor to climb a ledge (in very zombie-like fashion).  If you begin a fight, it's very likely most nearby zombies will begin homing in to your position, tightening like a noose around your location if you get carried away for too long kicking a zombie into some spikes on the wall.   [Second Impressions] The game's holding my interest well. The parkour never gets boring, though I've encountered a few hitches in areas with lots of climbable ledges too close together. The story so far has also steadily increased in intensity, and I find myself wondering where the plot will swing to next.   The skill trees are the highlight of my gaming experience right now. There's plenty of cool abilities to be unlocked, and pretty much all the individual skills are useful.   I also saw some other reviews complaining about the day/night cycle. It really all depends on where you are in the game. I spent the longest time exploring during the prelude to a story mission, because the game was simulating the day/night in real time, regardless of where I was on the map. It seems like most of the time the in-game hours are clucking along, but during missions that depend upon nightfall at a certain time, you get free time to explore in case you want to forestall nightfall. There really isnt much to do at night so far other than run for you life and fail 50% of the time. The npc hunters are very efficient at surrounding your location even if you just sit still without making a peep. But I also haven't mastered all the night time techniques yet either, like setting off traps at the proper moments, using flares and the UV flashlight. Still, making a successful run to a safe zone with hunters at your back is incredibly exhilarating and gratifying, but only if you succeed",

Playing at night kept me on a hair trigger and by far my favorite feature.  The items and crafting doesnt do anything new, but thats about the same as re inventing the wheel at this point. It works and thats all that matters. The game over all feels like its several different games we have already played, but only the good parts are in it. Its basically the game someone made up in a 'what if' scenario and did a really good job doing it.  Besides me not being able to use High Textures and Shadows because its too stuttery (GTX 780), i dont have anything bad to say about the game itself. If you like open world games like Borderlands, Far Cry, or Just Cause.... you should enjoy this game. Even on Medium (lowest setting?) the game still looks better than the consoles and on the PC it still features some graphical bonuses not present on the console for those who on the fence.

Sadly, there a bit of frame drops here and there (mostly outside the city) but with a patch or two, it should fix that. crashed once at the start where i skipped the intro or cutscene. The game is mostly a mix with Dead island and Mirror's Edge. Which is new to me, (and its not a all lose of your stuff then to a game like Dayz) And you get to scavenging for supplies and crafting without losing it, but limited save in your bag. I would recommend for the zoombie lovers and fans, sadly $71.99 USD is a bit much, maybe say $10 off for launch would be good. I would recommend for the sale that new games tend to how in 4 weeks time. Well make a review video in the next few days. Thanks for your time.",

            "review_text": "Dying Light is a vast open-world post-apocalyptic survival horror game combining the best features of various genres-   1) An RPG system that progressively allows you to become stronger, so that every time you level up you are better equipped with a variety of new skills to fight and survive- from martial arts to acrobatic moves that let you grapple, slide, stun, hook and perform incredible combinations of moves with stunning visual effect  2) Free-Running is one of the best aspects of the game. As you start out, you are weak and slow, but once you rank up and improve your skills you move significantly faster and are able to traverse the urban landscapes much better. Your feet rarely have to touch the ground as you jump and grapple-hook and climb your way across rooftops, scale buildings, slide along railings and swing from structure to structure at amazing heights  3) Crafting- in a world where you must scavenge to survive, you will spend alot of time exploring to find the best materials to improve the weak weapons you pick up, transforming them into slaughtering tools with a combination of elemental effects that shock, poison, burn, freeze, bleed and much more! You also are able to add upgrades to improve the damage, handling and durability of each weapon. However, to prevent players from using only one weapon indefinitely, there is a maximum number of repairs available  4) Survival Horror- Dying Light is a true survival horror game, and you never feel at ease, especially at night when you can barely see even with flares and flashlights. Hunting you are creatures of the night that can parkour as well. You must utilise your skills of stealth and/or parkour to effectively evade these creatures, or spend much of your ammunition and health trying to confront and hopefully, defeat them  This is, in my opinion, the best survival horror game ever made and it is a must-buy and must-play for all fans of the genre. There are many side quests, challenges, quarantine zones to do beside the main story, and you will also spend alot of time scavenging and looking for air drops. This game should take an average of 50-80 hours to fully complete.",

            "review_text": "I'm sprinting through an alley as I make my way to my objective, when I hear the sound of a plane flying overhead. I climb up to the nearest rooftop and wait for the flair indicating the location of the next supply drop to go off. It's quite a ways east of my location, but I don't mind the exercise. As I make my way across the rooftops, a message warning me that I should make my way indoors plays over my walkie talkie. The sun is setting, and that's when the Volatiles come out to play.  I don't have time for sleep though. By the time the sun comes back up, the supply drop will have already been taken by Rais' men, and we will lose more of our people if we don't get our hands on some more Antizin.  Suddenly the trail of rooftops I was following ends, and between me and the supply drop is a horde of Biters. I don't have time to think. I leap off the top of the building I'm on, and immediately toss my grappling hook at a nearby lamppost, pulling myself back up after just being inches from the ground. I spare no time scouting out a safe path to the supply drop, and leap from lappost to lamppost as the Biters below mindlessly follow.  I hear a familiar scream from the horde though. A Viral is among them, and easily matches my pace. I begin using my grappling hook more often now. That's the only advantage I have over this recently infected runner. If only he had known that his attempt at being a hero would end up making the lives of the uninfected all the more difficult.  I leap off the final lamppost in the row, and land just feet away from the supply drop. The Viral is right behind me though, and executing him with a gun wouldn't be a wise decision. He's wielding a crowbar, and matches me blow for blow. Dispatching of him is time consuming, and several Volatiles are making their way through the horde of Biters.   I begin my task of picking the lock on the supply drop crate as I hear the growling of the Volatiles get closer and closer.  The crate's open, and I grab the Antizen inside.  I don't waste time turning around to find out how close a call it was, and sprint away from the scene toward the nearest safe house.  ___________________________________________________   Dying Light is basically what Dead Island should have been. It's nothing like you've ever played before, but easily a hybrid of Mirror's Edge, and maybe Far Cry and Dead Island. Never mind the story, you're a survivor living in the city of the undead, and the playground is massive. There's two large sized maps, one of which you start out in, and another you unlock about halfway through the story. There's dozens of side missions for you to complete and unlock unique weapons and blueprints through. There's three skill trees related to Survivability, Parkour, and Weapons for you to level up individually and earn game changing abilities from.  By the time you near the end of the game, you're no longer the same survivor you were originally playing as. You unlock so many abilities that while navigating the city becomes easier, dispatching of enemies becomes more difficult as they gain strength alongside you.  And while there are no difficulty settings, the player can stick to doing missions during the nighttime while the Volatiles are out, making the game a lot more difficult, and rewarding them with twice the amount of experience they would have earned during the daytime.  There's also seamless, drop-in, drop-out, 4-player co-op that doesn't put any limitations on what you can do versus what you can do by yourself.  Did I mention that the PvP mode in this game is essentially a better version of the unreleased 'Evolve' game? The game pits 1-4 humans against a single player-controlled zombie, as they try and navigate the city at night, destroying nests.  Dying Light is well worth the purchase, and it won't surprise me if it makes it into some of the lists for 2015's Top 10 games, despite releasing so early on in the year.",

            "review_text": "Audio: For a game driven by activities and interactions with NPC's the audio is all over from sounding like whispers to exploding your ear drums leaving you playing while riding the remote like a movie. Seems no attention was payed to this aspect at all which normally is never a complaint.  Controls: For a game about parkour they out the jump button in the worst spot on the right bumper instead of the left trigger or the A button. This is the first time in gaming history ever played a game where such a commonly used feature is delegated to such an odd spot. The left trigger is for using equipment or a button for survivor sense, for a parkour game priority shoulda been given to the left trigger for jump instead of using equipment, it feels clunky and playing the game is the most important part, graphics, sound, an ambient world, none of it matters when the basic concept of playing the game is broken.  Equipment is bound to the left trigger, equipment can be thrown objects or ya know equipment. In every game that is usually on the right bumper, for this game they messed up the most basic part of a video game being able to play it, that alone relegates it to the bargain bin since it may take years for them to fix.  Parkour: broken due to the poor controls, if they were going for a free run experience without removing your thumb from the controller duck would be on the bumper instead of on the b button which means removing your thumb.  Dead zone: there is a slider for this but it seems broken or doesnt seem to make much of a diff leaving users slipping and sliding all over like its club penguin all over again. Devs have been absent from the steam community on the forums for weeks. Sadly they seem to have abandoned the community or worse maybe the game itself.   Parkour part 2: It sucks pretty bad, alot of jumps require perfect precision, but this isnt mirrors edge, its a poor mans version of mirrors edge that requires pixel perfect precision to grab onto object or your character just hits them and falls to their death. If your character is shimmying you cant look down to see if there is land below you, this leaves countless times players will just plunge to their death. Its just idiotic design, do a chin up and notice your head tilts down its called a neck, for some reason the character in this game doesnt have one.  Parkour 3: There is no way to climb down unlike other games where pushing towards an object as you fall grabs it in this game there is no way to do this. Time after time your player will climb somewhere high with no way to get down. Just hurl yourself off to your death since there is no way down off of alot of places.  Parkour 4: Parkour is a fancy word for walking.... its just fancy walking, the wordy 'parkour' itself causes pain to hear people use since it implies their doing something other than just fancy walking, its not impressive, quantum physics, or calculating derivatives is impressive but fancy walking is dead last on anyones bucket list.  Many jumps are so precise with their distance that being one bit off means absolute failure. Meaning some dev sat there and made them as annoying or difficult as possible for no reason, this is evident right in the tutorail which goes on for probably 30-50 minutes the longest tutorial in history just to show players where the jump button is.   Menuitis: Game suffers from ridiculous menus and button prompts. There are load zones, and unless you press a button it wont finish loading. Worst part is if you die you need to play a button mini game before it lets you play the game again, pressing X to skip a hint then A to load, how about just load the game and skip all these dumb button prompts. Stuff like this is pleb tier, imagine if Resident Evil everytime you opened a door you had to jump through button hoops to get to the other side, that is what this game is which means Resident Evil from 29 years ago is better designed than this game. Going through a load zone or dying shouldnt be a mini game, the game should be playing the game, which seems to be the last thing on anyones mind who made it. For some reason in multiplayer this doesnt exist.  Crafting 1: Most boring crafting ever in a game, takes place in the menu, not sure why this game is such a maze of menus, but hitting crafting an item makes you wait for it to build IN the menu, the game is paused anyways when in menu. You could be in the middle of a fight and start crafting. Then after waiting for the item to craft you have to hit another button to return to the menu. What a waste of time, its all just busy work. the game should revolve around playing the game not menus.  Crafting 2: There are very few items to craft with, get ready to have 100 strings and 100 bags of coffee. Takes all the fun out of crafting and why bother the weapons just break anyways and the zombies are easy enough without ever needing to craft one thing, also the crafted item are neither fun nor creative. Oh look its a hammer with knife on it... dead rising and dead island do it alot better with the cosmetic looks when it comes to crafting and fun.  Multiplayer: Voice Chat is awesome implementation, echoes when in hallways and such.  World seems big, maybe there is stuff to do in it? Who knows and who cares when the very act of playing the game is broken. Poor mans Mirrors Edge + Poor Mans Dead Rising = Dying Light.... oh and the zombies can parkour too as if that makes any sense, get that at night zombies can run but doing parkour is just dumb.

However there are a number of zombies in the game that if you find yourself alone in wide open spaces there can literally scare you half to death running for dear life but at the same time being able to jump onto anything or jump over a zombie whilst kicking the one right after that followed then bychopping the next zombie from the head down in half whilst switching to a concrete covered poll at some random zombie ten feet away from you because you shot off your gun because EVERYONE KNOWS THAT ZOMBIES ARE ATTRACTED TO NOISE but you still do it anyway because hey SHOTGUN ARE AWESOME. and Dying Light is literally my favorite zombie game since the third resident evil I played on the Nintendo 64.",

I haven't tried multiplayer yet but will likely duck out of this since the single player challenges the PC hardware enough.",

            "review_text": "Dying Light is a zombie survival game with a great story and totally awesome combat system, and a day/cycle that drastically changes how you play.  The game doesn't run optimally on my computer as of yet, but there is a post by the devs saying a fix is coming.  Even with these issues, this is still easily the best game I've ever played.  These are the reasons why sorted by what is most important to me.  Co-op Gameplay: It's the little things that make this game special, and the unique way you can kill zombies with your friends is awesome. My buddy was holding a propane tank and told me to hit it, so i did... He threw the tank into a horde of zombies blowing up at least five. It was amazing. While both you and your friend are in a menu the game will pause as it would in single player. Loot is personal so if you find something tell your friends to come too, no need to feel greedy.. TAKE EVERYTHING. Parkour running and literally jumping off zombies heads is also more fun with friends.  Day/Night Cycle: During the day we were badasses running around killing zombies, we took out a beast of a zombie with a huge weapon and even managed to beat up some of the thugs you find in the world. We ran the city... Then is was dark out, and suddenly we were hunted by the terrifying Virals. These zombies are loud and hunt in packs. When one finds you, they all find you. We spent whole first night running for our lives, evading pursuits and then sneaking around to objectives. Eventually day came and we were rewarded with Survivor Points, one of the game's forms of experience. Once again we were the badasses. We decided we're going to play the whole game through without skipping to day time (as this is an option). We'll see how it goes.  Loot Management/Weapon Repairs: Some people call this a negative but this is an element of the game that puts so many questions into my head. What might be useful? What do I have a lot of? What should I sell? What can I craft? What do I need to go find? You can upgrade your weapon and modify it, but eventually its going to break and be useless. Which means you need to lockpick police vans or hunt down some thugs to find new weapons or currency to buy new weapons. You will always need items to craft upgrades. Weapons are everywhere so don't worry about not having them. It's just more fun to kill for a while with a super badass upgraded weapon you crafted.  Combat System/Skill Trees: When you first begin your adventure you have low stamina, which means few hits and lots of falling back away from zombies, but as you level your Power skill tree you gain unique abilities like throwing stars and powerful strikes as well as the stamina upgrade.  In the Agility skill tree you can you learn how to vault off of zombies up to roofs, dropkick them into spikes, on to burning cars, into electrified water.. the possibilities seem endless and I'm excited to see how far I can progess my character. These skills mesh nicely with the combat system and eventually give you the feeling that you can climb and run anywhere and kick and smash anyone.  Open World Gameplay: There are a ton of side objectives that will pop up on your map at any given time, you don't have to participate, but the reawrds can often be very nice. Loot respawns so you can visit an area you found some good stuff at, zombies respawn so you can keep on chillin and killin... Need I say more. I love open world games.  The Story: Crane...rhymes with brain and train and plain and the other kind of plane. This guy is thrown into the apocalypse as some sort of undercover agent. I don't want to give too much away, but he has to deal with some conflict between his orders and his morals. I enjoyed the seriousness of the story as well as the funny little dialouges, and the insight you get from loading screens listening to your character's journal logs.   *The Cons: Like I said at the start, the game isn't running at 100% optimization on my machine yet. So I can't comment on graphics at this point. I will say the motion blur seems a little over the top. You want those types of things to barely visible, but when my buddy dropkicks a zombie he turns into the flash. Not a gamebreaker but kind of annoying.   OVERALL - A great game when enjoyed with at least one friend, four player co-op is probably amazing.  9/10 - Would dropkick 10,000 more zombies 10,000 more times.",

If you are a big Assassin's Creed fan you will love DL parkour, it is better than any AC game. If you lived under a rock and this is the first video game you have ever played in your life then you are going to have your head explode, so go play something else like Minecraft for a bit and then try this, you have to build up to this kind of awesomeness, its like discovering what the Matrix is or something like that.   This game suffers from what any other game such as Dead Island, Far Cry or the like suffer from, and that is some redundant fetch quests and similiar tedium. But you know what? The combat, enemy AI, parkour and graphics make even that something to look forward to. I don't mind fetching herbs mindlessly for some random NPC, because along the way I get to be a complete and total badass jumping rooftops and zip lining and drop kicking zed after zed into spikes or fires or off building ledges, it just never gets old!   Already a few mods are out, and I expect plenty to keep being created as time goes on. The game is just phenominal, it is demanding on low end PC's, but even on low settings the game is gorgeous and doesn't miss a beat.

            "review_text": "I wanted a game in which 'running away' was the most legit method of dealing with a shambling hoard of flesh eating monsters. I wanted a game where 'but I can REACH that roof' was a fine method of escape. I wanted a game where I was rewarded for intelligent behavior in a crisis, not reckless.  Behold: Dying Light - a game that in less that 30 minutes did what my parents were unable to do for years (when I was younger and stupider): enforce a GOD DAMNED CURFEW.  'XP is doubled at night!' Yeah, I'll bet it is. The game could seriously offer to rain down free AK-47s at night and I would still hoof my way back to a safehouse, crawl to my little soiled mattress, and hit the 'F' key to skip ahead to the morning every time.  This game is fun. It has the right combination of survivalishness, FPSness, and Mirror's Edge. You can fight the zombies - and are given tons of tools for doing so. However, fighting the zombies is not your job. Your job is to find crap, fix crap, and live to tell about it. You'll have to skull thump a zombie here and there. And there. And again. And AGAIN- STAY DOWN YOU CR- sorry, distracted. But the real meat of the game is avoiding them. The game is also not too cruel in your failing - if you do find yourself around a bunch of zombies, getting away isn't a trial.  ... unless it is night. At night, the SCARY zombies come out. They're faster than you. They leap higher than you. I think some of them shoot lasers. I'm not sure. I think you can fight them too - again, I'm not sure. I tried and one of them ate my face. Then I tried running and another one ate my face. Lots of face-eating. You have to learn to distract, use your tools wisely, activate traps, and run your ♥♥♥ over to a safezone ASAP. You're both forced to learn an area and think quickly.  Overall, it is pretty fun. And pretty. I haven't played for more than a few hours, but I still enjoy it. So far I'm only venturing into single player - and let me tell you now, the story mode is... interesting. Give it time. Let it stupidly handicap you for an hour or so until you get your freedom. Then? Run. Frolic. LIVE!  Just be back before dark.",

I would imagine the peformance issues have been addressed since launch by now. My rig is a i7 440 and I have a GTX770 graphics card with 16gb of ram.

If you prefer to play this game by yourself, I would like to caution you to play on normal because hard forces such lopsided leveling due to loss of survivor points. which in turn reinforces the difficulty of the game. Med packs are not nearly available enough when you get swarmed by 6 virals at the drop of a hair pin. I tend to burn through 10 a day and then keep on dying till I am able to attain more. In other words this game was based around multiplayer difficulty. Being a singleplayer against the enemy zombie player is very difficult due to how the zombie can do an enourmous amount of damage if someone isnt watching your back. Overall this game is ok by yourself, but for it to be worth full value you must play with other players.",

            "review_text": "An absolutely fantastic game.  [GAMEPLAY] Looking back on Dead Island &amp; Riptide, after playing this game, it seems like the developers really have learned from their experiences. Instead of picking a character already focused on one type of combat &amp; upgrading from there, you are free to customise your character as you see fit, which can lead to creating a character that not only fits your play style, but will influence your strategy in surviving in the game world. The game rewards strategic thinking.  It also rewards skill. The lockpicking from Skyrim is here, but without the unlockable character upgrades that can make it easier to open harder chests. It is simply down to your skill. Similiarly, gun-use does not require an unlockable upgrade, which if you play FPSs is hartily appreciated, as you don’t suck at guns for the first half of the game. What does upgrade is your bag, your free-running, your capability with hand-to-hand weapons - their use &amp; their mantainance, your crafting &amp; your health. You gain upgrade points by completing missions or helping random strangers you come across for SURVIVOR uprades, fighting for POWER upgrades &amp; free-running for Agility upgrades, which can lead to you one-hitting zombies or sprinting along walls Prince of Persia style. And you are rewarded for combinations of jumps, landings, attacks &amp; timing, which creates a REAL feeling of progression, as you see what is benefiting you.   Every time you run into something that might get stale, you find the developers have dropped in new elements to keep things fresh. Every now &amp; again you will run into a new type of zombie as the story progresses, which will force you to find new ways to fight them, or to focus on different upgrades or weapons to even the odds. Also, halfway through the game you gain access to a new district, akin to Shadow of Mordor but, unlike SoM, the area has changed so much that your approach to playing changes as well, requiring a slightly altered style of play; a fresh challange against which to pit the skills you honed in the last area.  There is also the day/night cycle. You are rewarded a boost to XP for Agility &amp; Power at night &amp;, not only are certain enemies more powerful, but new faster, stronger &amp; more durable enemies appear. Meaning you can sleep through the night OR you can choose to go and about trusting your agility to guide you through, or just wade in when your feel yourself strong enough. And crafted gadgets like firecrackers &amp; flares (which ward off the big bads) make this actually do-able, when at first it seems like a mad prospect!  The game is very well put together, providing well-balanced &amp; varied enemies so that you cannot just climb up high or run really fast &amp; expect to breeze through &amp; avoid danger, you have to engage with it &amp; REALLY play the game. Similiarly, if you don't want to play at night, you don't have to. But there are parts of the story where you are forced to act against your inclinations &amp; embrace night running, presenting you with the hard opportunity to either just run, praying, or think about it strategically, should you ever be caught out again. (The camouflage ability came in really handy for me in those situations, which was a strategic choice I didn't have to make and, without it, I would have needed to play very differently to survive.)  The free running mechanic is also extremely well-polished &amp;, after a little while, you get a sense for what distances you can cross, what ledges you can make it to, &amp; this also presents an interesting way to approach quests, since you can approach enemy camps from above as well as below. Finding your own way, via your own ingenuity is extremely satisfying.   [GRAPHICS] The graphics for the game look brilliant. The faces for some characters could be better done &amp; there is the occasional cloning of very minor npcs, but the regular, major &amp; critical NPCs look well, individual &amp; everything from weapons, to gore, to the city itself looks great. The atomsphere is very well done indeed: rain is wet, the world &amp; you will be soaked. Get soaked at your vision will be compromised. It looks &amp; feels exactly like it should. Also, the night is daaaaark, like it should be.   (I ended up in a really nerve-wracking area &amp; found myself telling the character to wipe his bleeping eyes already so I could see! All of it works to heighten the tension. Similarly, at one point he was exhausted and his breathing was loud &amp; heavy, &amp; I found myself worrying that the undead might actually hear it, since they react to all kinds of sounds in the world, which leads us to...)   [SOUND] Thunder, water, rain, impact sounds, sloughing guts - it all sounds like it should, pulling you in. The undead also make different sounds, which will have you turning about looking for the extra dangerous one you just heard shriek as it spotted you. There are ambient sounds of distant fires, fighting, monster &amp; human screams - when you are moving about through a dangerous area &amp; someone (there are a number of different types) screams distantly 'HELP ME!', or just cries out in terror, you hear it but the way it is generated leaves you wondering what direction it came from, giving the city a feeling of living terror that is constantly shifting and moving, and it fits superbly.  The music too is fitting &amp; some tracks are great to listen to. The menu music alone had me sitting listening for a few moments every time I loaded up the game to get me into the feel of it. I still listen to it after having completed the game.  [STORY &amp; CHARACTERS] The main characters, from the kid who you worry isn't old enough to take charge, to the guy who rallied the first survivors you meet, to the woman you run with (trying to avoid spoilers), and practically across the board, all have their own back stories &amp; many have stories that have influenced the city in some way, you cross posters for some, &amp; meet random survivors who have met or know of others. The stories are nuanced as well, &amp; aren’t rammed down your throat, you get a sense of the person from your time with them &amp; from what others say, which allows you to not only bond with the characters you like but also to fill in the pieces of their back story specifically left out because it isn't pertinent to what they are saying at the time, which feels more realistic.  While there has been the occasional complaint about the main bad guy being something of a stereotype, his backstory (discovered in-game) reveals that he was a very different man up until a short while ago, and even when first the quarantine first arrived. But, now, he is exactly the type of person this crisis would create. Someone who's mind has shifted to see things differently, aiding his survival.  And the story is strong enough, with both your own mission and the added element of the people you get to know and need to protect, that it keeps the momentum up. Regular breaks with new orders from your bosses outside the quarantine give you an actual moral tie to the game and the people you are either helping or putting in danger with your actions. And the fact that side missions tend to build on themselves, creating new issues that arise from other missions make it feel like a more vibrant and alive experience.   [OVERALL] This is solid game that anticipates the lulls that exist in open world gameplay &amp; actually addresses them to keep things fresh. It is fast, and rewarding and has just the right amount of everything to keep you playing. The peaks and troughs that exist in open world games are a shadow of what they were. The peaks are still there, but you don't feel like your are are wasting time with busy work until your next story mission. It is definitely one I would recommend. I'm already feeling its absence now that I've finished it.",

I had my LOD set to 0 yet i was still getting mind blowing far off views. I can only imagine what its like set to full. Npcs are lifelike in appearance and the world is so fully realised in its detailed environments i feel like am actually there. The only way it could get any more real is with one of those up and coming virtual reality headsets.   Audio and music brings home the classic eerie nightmare feel of a George Romero, Lucio Fulci, Ford Brothers zombie movie with just the right balance of real life ambience and theatrical stimuli. Voice acting is marvelous giving life to npcs and your character while enhancing further the believabilty of the amazing highly fleshed out world.  As you play through the game your character will level up getting skill points depending on what he does most in the game. If they are a runner type their agility tree will get skill points to use on different strengths. If they are a smash and kill every undead in sight type they will get skill points in their power tree etc.  The environment is very tactile with tons of things you can interact with. From turning on radios to collecting common day items you can then use to craft new things with like weapons and home made health kits. You can pick locks of different levels of difficulty but be weary time will not stop and a zombie may chomp into your skull because you didnt pay mind to its shuffling feet as you greedily picked a locked chest. You can rummage through buildings for food and money while coming across people in need of help. If you decide to help them it will effect how they view you. If not oh well you scoundrel you! Movement is also another spectacular very natural feeling action executed in spectaculer fashion by DYING LIGHT finding myself climbing and jumping onto and off buildings, diving under things etc etc. Usually i suck at games that have acrobatics but in DYING LIGHT it all felt so right with the parkour system.  You will see npcs going about their daily lives while having to deal with the horrors of the zombie plague. One time i came across a bunch of children in a day care school setting in a apartment building as a female teacher read them children stories. Another time i listened to one of the many varied accounts of those fighting zombies as i explored a building.  Combat is alot of fun as well as quite scary. While you engage zombies your stamina will go down making your attacks less effective and you more vulnerable to a zombie(s) assault. Zombies may be slow moving but they will tear you apart as you scream in horror when you suddenly find yourself surrounded by a slow moving horde of rotting corpses.   Your weapons have wear and tear which means that metal pipe will be useless after one too many door smashed open by it or zombie skull caved in. Fear not though for you can repair your items back to working shape with items you salvage in the world.  DYING LIGHT its the ELDER SCROLLS and METRO 2033/METRO LAST LIGHT of zombie games. Truly a mind blowing masterpiece that will give you hours upon hours of endless gameplay with a awesome campaign and plenty of side quests.  To have this much enjoyment from my i5-3570k 3.40ghz with 8.0gb ram, Radeon HD 7770 card at a resolution of 1366x768 is miraculous. All i can say is thanks and DYING LIGHT is definitely a title worth playing and paying full price for.  DYING LIGHT a magnificent and rare treasure of a game.",

            "review_text": "First off, the short version is yes, this game is worth the money and isn't a buggy, unplayable, DLC ridden mess from the get go. The combat is fun and visceral, and the parkour elements are fun once you get used to them. The keyboard controls are actually well done (This seems to be uncommon now for multiple platform games).   A quick breakdown of pros and cons I've seen so far:  Pros:  You feel like you're buying two games at once. The nighttime mechanics change the game and how you play a TON. While you can mow through zombies during the day once you find your first decent weapon, once the sun sets, you'll be dodging for safe houses QUICK. While nighttime becomes far less deadly once you begin modding premium katanas and such, for a good portion of the game it will be dangerous, and truly makes you play like a survivor in a post-apocalyptic world.  The background music and ambient sounds are amazing. You'll be able to discern where and how close mobs are to you, and the chanting/moaning music really makes the gameplay more suspenseful, especially at night. The first time a screamer got behind me at night I almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself.  The graphics are stunning, although some builds may need to turn them down until another optimization patch hits. For what it's worth, I'm running a Nvidia GTX770 with an I7 CPU and it runs on max perfectly. Your mileage may vary.  The game supports multiple playstyles, you can either be a true runner, springing from rooftop to rooftop to avoid the infectious horde, or go to town on their heads with a baseball bat.  The co-op in this game is a true co op experience, where you can run through the campaign together and you both get progress, or you can invade a friend as a super-zombie and try to eat him alive!  There is a massive amount of content with sidequests and story. After playing for 30 hours, I believe I've just hit the 25% progress mark.  Cons:  I'm suspect of the replay value once you complete all the quests. The game does have a NG+ mode, but the weapon customization is not in depth enough to keep you grinding for a true super weapon, so it'll essentially be more of the same.  Some PC builds have problems running the game due to bottlenecked CPU requirements. For now, the game seems to utilize one core, regardless of how many cores are in your CPU.  And I can't believe I'm saying this, but torwards the end of the game, you are much too strong at night. Once you mod an orange katana, you'll one hit everything except the beefiest night-only mobs, and even then they only take 2-3 shots to kill.    Overall, it's a very good game worth the pricetag, and is a must have if you have a spouse or friend you enjoy playing zombie games with.  9/10, would dropkick zombies off a bridge again.",

Sound is as discomforting/scary as Dead Island and the whole new game of night time is scary and challenging, in a good way. Dying doesn't have enough impact imo.

The crafting is very simple, you dont have to waste alot of time learning a difficult crafting system. The games fast pace nature puts you in and out of the action as fast as you can react. The zombies also react to everything you do, setting off car alarms and throwing fireworks are some of the ways to distract the big hordes you will come across. It will get hard, it will get intense, and it will look amazing... The game is Great :)",

This game is truly a hard core zombie survival game with its consistent zombie attacks and parkour. The disadvantage I can give to dying light is the multiplayer loading screen glich which can be annoying when you are in the middle of doing a story line quest for example. Also I would like to bring up that the tutorial is most useful to any new players, at the start of the game it may be abit boring when they teach you the common skills (you need to know) but in the end its useful.   Dying light at night is very challenging when coming across volatiles and bloodthirsty zombies. In my personal opinion I can admit that the first night you encounter is very mortiferous.    Trust me guys you may get annoyed when your stuff starts to break on the game when killing many deleterious zombies.  The weapons on dying light are very weak at the start of the game, but when you progress through the game they will get higher because you will find better loot leading to weapons such as 'dark weapons' which can be found at night or at a shop in the game.  All in all this is a great game but I do think I will get bored soon though after I have done all the side quests!  I give this game a 7/10 because of its graphics and gamplay and parkour and day and night circle and of its amazing story. I hope they add many more dlc's in the future to come!",

This is one of the few games in which zombies a threat, even though they aren't smart. Its kind of like walking dead, where one lone zombie doesnt pose much of a threat, but a group of them (and they are abundant everywhere) is near impossible to fight on your own. I wish this is where they stopped with the zombies because IMO its perfect. However, there are a few special mobs that are extremely powerful (oversized guys, night hunters) that are a bit immersion breaking for me. Even still, the game draws you in quickly and is extremely entertaining doing even the most menial tasks (like getting someone chocolates).  Graphically the game is bittersweet. Its a gorgeous looking game, but sadly, as it is ported to PC, In its current state (as of Jan 28th/2015) it is poorly optimized and will cause all but the top of the line PC's some issues. MY PC is an i5-4670k (at base 3.5ghz clock or now), paired with 8gb ram (1600mhz), a 480gb SSD, and an EVGA overclocked Nvidia GeForce GTX 770 2gb. Even still, I've had to drop the graphics settings to ensure a stable FPS with no stuttering. Even at medium graphics there is stuttering during gameplay and especially entering cutscenes the game will freeze for me for a while to load. I play other games such as War Thunder, Crysis, Far Cry 3, etc at max graphics w/60FPS or better on 1080p res no issues, so there is room for improvement with the graphics.   Definitely worth a go for those who like a challenge with a survival horror game. It definitely gives you a good sense of horror if you aren't in a safe zone at night!  GOOD LUCK!",

I wanted a game where 'but I can REACH that roof' was a fine method of escape. I wanted a game where I was rewarded for intelligent behavior in a crisis, not reckless.  Behold: Dying Light - a game that in less that 30 minutes did what my parents were unable to do for years (when I was younger and stupider): enforce a GOD DAMNED CURFEW.  'XP is doubled at night!' Yeah, I'll bet it is. The game could seriously offer to rain down free AK-47s at night and I would still hoof my way back to a safehouse, crawl to my little soiled mattress, and hit the 'F' key to skip ahead to the morning every time.  This game is fun. It has the right combination of survivalishness, FPSness, and Mirror's Edge. You can fight the zombies - and are given tons of tools for doing so. However, fighting the zombies is not your job. Your job is to find crap, fix crap, and live to tell about it. You'll have to skull thump a zombie here and there. And there. And again. And AGAIN- STAY DOWN YOU CR- sorry, distracted. But the real meat of the game is avoiding them. The game is also not too cruel in your failing - if you do find yourself around a bunch of zombies, getting away isn't a trial.  ... unless it is night. At night, the SCARY zombies come out. They're faster than you. They leap higher than you. I think some of them shoot lasers. I'm not sure. I think you can fight them too - again, I'm not sure. I tried and one of them ate my face. Then I tried running and another one ate my face. Lots of face-eating. You have to learn to distract, use your tools wisely, activate traps, and run your ♥♥♥ over to a safezone ASAP. You're both forced to learn an area and think quickly.  Overall, it is pretty fun. And pretty. I haven't played for more than a few hours, but I still enjoy it. So far I'm only venturing into single player - and let me tell you now, the story mode is... interesting. Give it time. Let it stupidly handicap you for an hour or so until you get your freedom. Then? Run. Frolic. LIVE!  Just be back before dark.",

            "review_text": "Had fun playing it, was long but didn't drag out, story missions were a little weak, but everything else makes up for it.  Game play is good, parkour can be alittle hard to get used to at first, but once you do, you'll notice it missing in other games. Melee combat is good, doesn't get out of hand like in Dead Rising, and even when your at full power(max levels) you can still be overwhelmed by the zombies if not careful.  Had a nice variety of melee weapons, but didn't like escalation of melee weapon damage, making some of your favorite weapons obsolete, and alot of the weapon craft recipes obsolete also. Probably could of done it another way, but it's not a deal breaker. The variety of grenades would of been nice if at least half of them were effective, but the ones that work, really work, while the others were just wasted resources. Another thing about melee combat: why can't you parry like the human NPC's can?  Gun combat was probably the weakest part of the game, variety of firearms sucks, and the ones you do get generally don't get used much because of the noise they generate. No Suppressors for firearms. Minor spoiler, later in the game you run into someone who should be able to make them, but nope. You can craft all kinds of weird stuff, but no suppressors. There were a few times your pretty much forced to use firearms, and when you do, they just don't 'feel' right. They do work though, you just won't be using them much.  Day/night cycle was great. During the day, you scavenge, get stuff done. There is danger, but for the most part you can get into and out of trouble without dying(going to want to concentrate on building up agility at first, mobility is the key to survival). Night, well, it's been awhile since a game has made me nervous. Nighttime in this game is deadly. Other types of zombies come out to play, and even at the later levels its pretty easy to get killed. Unless you play with the gamma up, it's DARK. You eventually do get some night vision, but when you do venture out at night, you need a plan. It helps greatly to get familiar with your surroundings, the closest safe house, and the path there.  Variety of enemies is mixed. Human enemies come in the have guns and don't have guns variety. They can be a pain to fight, though you will figure out a few tactics that make them easy to kill. Nice variety of zombies, most are the slow kind, but even that can be deceptive because some of them are as quiet as the grave and can sneak up on you if your not paying attention. There are some fast ones, some tough ones, and then there are the ones at night who are fast, tough, and generally unkillable until later in the game. Even then, they like to call for help, so again, night combat is hit and run.  There are a small variety of activities that can give you something to do, and alot of them will at least help you level up, if not give you weapon upgrades and recipes. Don't let the story rush you, far as I can tell there is no time limit. The story missions...meh. Some were good, but I really hated how they forced you into situations. They will take control of the clock, so even if you started in the morning, you could wind up out at night. Or gear is taken away from you(they at least give you the option of getting it back, but it only made sense once). And the end fight is anticlimatic at best. Still, not deal breaker,  The game world itself is nice. Graphics look good, and the world itself shows that they put effort into this. Nice variety of locations, and even traveling from one end of the map to the other didn't feel like a chore most times. Exploring would yield rewards much of the time, and there are all kinds of out of the way or almost hidden places. You can jump or climb to almost any place, though some places did take alittle thinking to get to. Another thing, heights. I hate heights. I actually got a bit of vertigo climbing some of the towers.  All in all, I loved playing this game. Room for improvement, sure. But this is one of the best games I've played in a long while.",

It runs perfectly fine, 60 FPS with very little frame drop, if any at all. But every single time I get bit by a zombie, or get hit by green slime from a spitting one, or (sometimes) activate a cinematic cut scene, my screen locks up, FPS drops to 1 for anywhere from a few seconds to half a minute. It's incredibly infuriating and frustrating to the point to where I've cold restarted my computer twice because it happens so often. I know the issue is SLI based. I'm running two 670's in SLI, I've changed the SLI bit a few times, and it's made the problem, for the most part better. But it's still there. I'm sure there will be a fix for it eventually, so that's why I'm not rating this 'no'. The game, when working, is incredibly fun and addictive. It definitely feels like a new, polished dead island. It's beautiful graphically. Freerunning is amazing and really gives some depth to traveling from place to place. I just hope they fix the SLI bug eventually.",

I was frusterbated!  Looked through the reviews... noticed a trend. alot of people (including me) that were having issues, most appeared to be running Win7. I had 8.1 (x64) laying around, bite the bullet and installed it...

There are a good variety of side-quests to do and the world is overall really enjoyable to run around and murder zombies in. The voice acting is honestly pretty bad and the lip-synching is questionable. Some characters have fairly good lip-sync while others are just not even close to being accurate. Also the variety of 'special' zombies in this game are pretty good. Some of them you will have likely seen in other zombie games before this, but some will be a pretty good suprise.  Do I recommend the game? Yes. Do I think you should wait for more patches till you buy? Maybe. If you absolutely cannot play a game sub 60 fps then I recommend holding off.

Like many people say, the storyline may not be that great, as it is very predictable and 'cliche', however the gameplay is simply incredible. From the bery beginning, you are able to parkour and free-run wherever you want, whenever you want. Also, as you progress in the game, you unlock even more abilities, such as being able to use zombies as footstools, dropkicking zombies in the face, and running straight through hordes of enemies by tackling them all to the ground. All of the abilities you unlock allow your movement throught the map to become so fluid that you can get to anywhere you want without stopping. The fighting mechanics and abilities are also outstanding. Just like the parkour aspect, you unlock more abilities as you grow stronger, allowing you to grapple enemies to the ground, drop on their heads from rooftops assassin's creed style, and throw your weapon straight into a zombie's brain. The third primary aspect of the game, 'survival', is just as well polished as the others. The longer you survive, the more proficient you become at doing. You can learn how to pick locks, create powerful elixirs to boost your abilities, and even use a grappling hook to get to hard to reach areas.  The weapon system is also very well done. As you level up, you can obtain stronger weapons, and you can also modify them and upgrade them using blueprints and materials you find throughout the map. In conclusion, this game is awesome. The gameplay makes you feel like Chuck Norris, and if you play it too much, you might actually start to think you are. The only bad part about it is that you have to have a beefy computer to run it, which might crush alot of dreams for some people (I had to buy a new graphics card just to run it). Anyway, other than needing amazing computer specs (and the horrible DLC's), I give this game 5 stars.",

This game sets an example that needs to be followed, the amount of bugs are fairly low, and yes, there may be performance issues, but no game shall ever be perfect. The polish in this game is unlike i've ever seen, to the way the particle effects react, such as smoke slowly spreading to a room in an abandoned apartment after opening a door, the way the lighting is done, where a flashlight isn't just shining light on the nearest wall, but actually providing a cone of light, even in the void of night. The way the enemy strength isn't shown to you with a number, but by changing their appearence subtly, to the point where i only noticed the pattern over halfway into the game.  Sure, some of the enemies might be a bit easy, and some may be annoying in a very unfair way, such as one enemy being able to fire upon you, yet being nowhere to be found, they have however kept the fear in the night, to the point where once you are at the highest power you can be, you think to yourself you can take everything on without trouble, but the Volatiles, they are always kept as terrifying as in the beginning, because while you may kill one or two, more will come, and you will not be able to stop them.  The movement system, being from someone who absolutely loved Mirror's Edge, was brilliant, and while one may want something such as horizontal wall running, it may have felt a bit too unrealistic if done wrong, and while you get a grappling hook, you cannot use it to completely bypass any obstacle, which i feel is fair, for why would you want to get away from such a massive part of the game?  The story manages to be original, considering the medium is very heavily used, you actually grow to like the characters, which many games fail to do. And finally, while Troy Baker might be becoming the new Nolan North, this might be one of his greatest performances, especially near the end, the emotion in his voice is something many voice actors cannot replicate.  As for the problems, there are performance issues, some of the challenges in the game can be anger inducing due to focusing on a specific mechanic, such as cutting zombies in half, and there are some inconsistancies in the story (one of which, is only due to keeping a gameplay mechanic in, for removing it for the second half of the game would have been a horrible idea), but overall, 45 hours, none of which was with repetitive gameplay such as grinding or multiplayer (be the zombie), which is much more than many games can provide in this age of gaming.  Let's just hope that this game sets a new bar, and that we get to see more games with this level of care put into it.",

There is one thing that is a spoiler, so I'll put it on here with one giant spoiler warning.   SPOILER WARNING BEYOND THIS POINT The final boss is a quicktime event that is impossible to do unless you know he buttons before it happens. This leads to a really anti-climactic end.",

            "review_text": "I'll start with this: Dying Light is worth every bit of the price of entry. I can't remember the last time I've enjoyed myself this much in a zombie game. Almost everything about the game kept bringing me back to one word: fun.   Bashing zombie's: fun. Running around large, mostly open world: fun. Upgrading your abilities based on how you played the game: fun. Jumping from building to building and juuuuust barely making it onto that terrace: fun. Finding parts and upgrading weapons to make some kind of toxic, flame sword: fun. Creating and using a grapling hook: super fun. Picking a lot and carefully listening for something to come up behind me and kill me: fun. Thinking I could probably take on that horde of zombies, finding out I can't and barely escaping with my life: fun. Clearing out new safe houses: fun. Running for my life every single time the sun went down: fun. This game just nailed combat, movement, and the rpg elements. Add all this to the fact that there is a distinctly '80s vibe to the whole thing and I was in love.  About 2/3 of the way through my play time, however; things started to break down about. There didn't seem to be any new enemies to fear or present any kind of real challenge. I'd realized pretty early that there really wasn't any reason or advantage to be out at night, but the lack of safe houses meant I would sometimes get stuck out there do to poor planning on my part. Once I'd cleared out all the safe houses I was never far enough away from one at night so that I couldn't just get to one and go to sleep until morning. The grapling hook that I loved, made the game a bit too easy at times, allowing for quick escapes from bad situations where my lack of forword thought should have gotten me killed. As great as melee combat was, the gun play is a bit boring. I found myself saying 'another gun fight?' way too often and wished that they would have just stuck with melee weapons or made amunition waaay harder to come by so that you really had to think about every bullet you fired. Finally, the last boss in the story missions was such a let down, and when I really thought about it, there was nothing else it could have been. In a world of crazy, blood thirsty, sometimes mutant zombies, just some bad dude with a machette really wasn't comparable.   Techland did so much right with Dying Light and I think that's made the mistakes stand out more. Still, I would recommend this it to anyone, even if only for the first 2/3s of the game.",

            "review_text": "What a pleasant surprise this turned out to be..  I hadn't heard anything about this game, even after it was released. I learned about it from the commercials after launch. I decided to purchase it after watching some streams online.   What a great game. I'm 32 and have been feeling a little bored with games lately. Dying Light came in, and I've started enjoying firing up the old PC and getting online for some multiplayer again.   Graphics: Outstanding. The first thing that caught my attention was the detail Techland paid to creating a believable world in Harran. From enormously long view distances, to the varying weather patterns, day and night cycle (more on nights later), blood splattering on you and NPC's after smashing a few zombies heads, to the effects of the wind on the palm trees and characters clothing, the graphics are a joy to take in with the settings turned up.   Gameplay: Who would have thought parkour and zombies would be such a great combo? I really enjoy playing this game. I can spend hours just free running the city, challenging myself to go farther and farther without stopping my sprint. The game is beautifully violent, with dismemberment, decapitations, and heads smashing GALORE. The game features a deep skill tree over three seperate categories, and I like how you are penalized for dying by losing your survivor points. The missions do not feel like chores, and I appreciate how Techland spent the extra time planning the side missions to add value to them. The side missions have some story to them, and do a great job of showing off the different elements to the gameplay. As much fun as the game is in single player, it really shines when you can get a group of three other players who enjoy cooperating and communication to join up with, and progress the story together. The feeling of dread on my first playthrough during the first night was amazing. Techland really nailed the atmosphere, and the fear factor when you start dealing with the pursuits. The multiplayer component also includes a competitive aspect with the ability to play as a hunter and invade other players games. The resulting chess match of the humans weapons and items vs. the overpowered abilities of the hunter is damn fun, and didn't feel unfair at all, especially when you have a couple of people helping watch your back during an invasion. I enjoyed Dead Island's multi, but the game was so sloppy and unpolished that it broke the immersion for me and just couldn't save it in my opinion. This is what Dead Island should have been.   Sound: The voice acting is above average, and did not get on my nerves as most games scripting and voice acting will. All of the sounds of sledgehammers crushing skulls, military rifles unloading on a group of zombies, and the resulting screams of virals in the distance who are now alerted to your presence are presented wonderfully over my speakers, and even better over my surround headset. The positional audio is spot on.   Overall: One of the best games I've ever played to be honest. I love me a good, violent video game, and this one delivers. I love the carnage, and the visceral imagery on display in Dying Light. It's fun to screw around in, and has a solid story line to be played when you get bored of screwing around. The physics system is great, so many lol worthy moments to be had once you you get the grasp of the controls and skills. Cheers to Techland for doing such a good job with Dying Light, and proving that I'm not getting too old to enjoy a video game afterall. I highly recommend buying this game.   10/10",

Parkour: Near Flawless. Taking inspiration from Mirror's Edge, this is my favorite part. Sometimes my hand gets stuck in the model I'm climbing on to, but that is only a minor detail. You'll be using this alot, as it easily surpasses murdering every zombie on the street. You'll be using this alot during Night time.  Combat: For the first 4-6 hours you'll mainly be using melee weapons. The comabt is similar to Dead Island's (because it's by the same developer, Techland), which is a good thing. But this time around, you don't have a health bar for your enemies. Aim for the head. Sometimes, you might have to run away to heal or repair your weapons, adding to the realism. About the time you get to the second city, it'll be the following guns: Military Rifle, Police Rifle, German 9mm Pistol, and the Double-Barrelled Shotgun. They're a little overpowered. Thankfully they don't give as much exp.  The Lag: If you have a decent modern gaming rig, you might be able to run it. I'd stay away if your graphics card is not in the Minimum/Recommended specs. Hopefully they patch most of it. I have to stay at about the lowest settings to get an average of 40 fps. Easily better for consoles.  Graphics: With the lag comes the pay off. Graphics. They are excellent. (Not the all-time best I've seen) In my opinion though, it's gameplay over graphics.  Extra Content: This game has a long campaign. But what if you wanted to do more? Side quests are everywhere and are plentiful. The Season Pass might be worth $20.00 if you like the game (I bought it with the Ultimate Edition). Some of the side quests characters can be weird though...  Rating: 8.5/10 If you have a great gaming rig. 7/10  If you have a decent gaming rig. 9.9/10 For parkour fans. 8.5/10 For combat fans. 9/10 For Linux support (why not Mac then too?)  Overall Rating: 8.2/10 Past it's lag and overpowered weapons late-game, it teaches you how to survive by avoiding zombies instead of straight up murdering them. Enemies take a lot to take down (besides with the insta-kill headshot guns, which is logical) so you might have to run away and repair your weapons or heal. The Side Quests and Season Pass will keep you entertained with extra content once you beat the Campaign. Co-op with your friends (which I haven't played) is cool. It's worth $60.00 if you have a great gaming rig.",

I was not disappointed although I'm sure I could have survived waiting for a sale. The game is excellent at it's core, however, the standard AAA annoyances and disappointments do bring it down at times.  The parkour system is top notch, on par with Mirror's Edge except there is definitely more freedom of movement and surfaces to climb. One of the most interesting and enjoyable parts of the game for me was combat. Fighting zombies just feels right in this game. The devs nailed it. At first you can only swing a melee weapon 3 or 4 times before your character becomes winded and out of breath. Even a group of three slow zombies can be a serious threat in the right situation. And that's really fun. One of my critiques is that I think you can level up your character too much. Fighting during the day becomes less challenging and more boring. Fighting at night and against the stronger specials gets to the point where it is about just right, but I would rather the two levels of difficulty meet a little more in the middle and have the character gain less power overall.  Weapons are pretty good too: using melee weapons is fun as hell and i think i played about 10 hours before I even found a gun. I used it in a panick to kill three thugs who cornered me later on and i used up the whole mag, rendering the gun useless. Firing a gun is one of the worst decisions you can make in the game, as it draws hordes of the undead. It's definitely a last resort, which I like. Unfortunately, the game is absolutely littered with weapons to find and you will be constantly be deciding which items to dump from your inventory to make room for the shiny new scimitar you found. Weapons also suffer from becoming too powerful and thus, boring.   This is probably the only zombie game I've played that truly fits the fiction of a zombie apocalypse and caters to the rules of surviving in such a scenario.  The story is pretty much straight trash. The villain is uninspired, the ending is anticlimactic and frustrating, and theres a pretty sexist damsel in distress sequence. Much like far cry, the game excels when it hands freedom to you rather than story missions or QTE's.   The root of the gameplay is crazy fun and takes a long time to get old. It took me 40 hours just to complete the base story, so its a good time/money investment. The open world is great as well, but there is no fast traveling. Usually this isnt a problem because the running is so fun. But towards the end of the game when you are running the sewer gauntlet between halves of the map again and again it gets pretty annoying.   Overall, solid game.",

The game is VERY SCARY AT NIGHT! The baddest of the baddest come out to play! For me, I found night missions 3 spooky 5 me... so prepare your ♥♥♥♥!  The graphics are amazing, but not optomized greatly... Even great builds won't have the best frame-rate when recording, but its not horribly bad that its unplayable or even close to low frame-rate. Some of the extra settings Dying Light contains can make the game look worse sometimes, so I highly suggest to turn them off if you're very graphical intensive minded.  I haven't yet beat the story... I'm nearly at 30% of the Story yet it feels like I spent more time playing the game. In my opinion this is my #1 favorite game that tops Fallout 3 &amp; Fallout: New Vegas! I know they're not to be compared, but just in my excitement and adrenaline that flows through my veins when playing this game allows me to know whats good.  Hopefully those who are thinking about getting this game actually do!

Many people will compare it to far cry, and I agree with the comparison, but the movement system is industry-leading in my opinion. The Following DLC really feels like a continuation and enhancement to the game in the best way possible. Whether the story realy fits, I can't decide, but it has a giant new map, new mechanics and skills, and tons to do. The dense cities of the original game are replaced with open farmland. The environment is far more dangerous. I have yet to decide if the added difficulty is a pro or con. I began the DLC with a max-level character and a full inventory of weapons and I still find the game challenging; more so than running through the old map areas. Trying to level the new skill trees along with the original skills could be a daunting task, but I have yet to try that. The vehicle adds a whole new element to the game and seems to fit really well with the challenges presented by a more open map, not just transport but cover and weaponary as well. Gun play was also added as a major rathar than minor element. There are new guns and lots more ammo to be had. The extra fire power seems to make dungeon areas more approachable, but in the open landscape, if you have to shoot, you'd butter run. I'd recommend this game to anyone whether they like zombie games or not.",

This game is a total trip, I've been co-op'ing with a friend of mine since the beginning and we were so scared of the regular zombies at first, then we would unlock a skill or a weapon and we'd get a little braver. Our Parkour skills were crap and getting around the massive environment would take a while! Then we started getting better at the parkour and were running all around the map like no problem. The more efficient and better we got, the more fun we had. The game has a leveling system where you level up your skills by using them, so you are rewarded for doing things like killing zombies and running on rooftops. Then night-time came, and we were scared sh!tless. The first night we didn't make it more than 30 steps out of the safe house. Then as we practiced and got better skills, it wasn't so bad, but the night hunters were still terrifying. Then came the grappling hook - and that changed everything. I feel like batman but with super badass weapons that have tons of customizable options. The game rewards exploring and doing sidequest, and even doubles your xp for parkour'ing at night. I often just log on and go from one side of the map to another. The combat is hilarious and there are tons of ways to kill zombies thanks to the diverse weapons and tons of environmental kills you can get. My favorite by far is the drop kick, I recommend everyone get it as soon as possible. I have over 20 hours with this game and have still not beaten it, I'm in no hurry, due to the random events that happen and tons of sidequest and loot you can find. I think if you combine Mirrors Edge + Borderlands + Assassins Creed you would somewhat have this game. It's awesome and you should get it.   tl:dr Buy it",

Companies started milking zombies (don't picture that), so.. I also got tired of walking corpses and moved on to other things. But during this Christmas sale I thought i'd finally give Dying Light a try. So I dimmed the lights, put my headphones on, set the game difficulty on hard and let the immersion soak in and let me tell you.. I haven't had this much fun in a video game for a long time. This is a very good game. Execution is excellent, movement is solid, sound is scary, visuals are beautiful and dark. I even love the story, straightforward and fitting.

First of all: This game is remarkable; the graphics look stunning and the gameplay feels fluid and most of the times not staggered. The Parkour is alright to say the least, it isn't Mirror's Edge but it is tied in well enough to be fun most of the time - I have seen many people have problems with the port but I have to say that I have found no problems with any lag (Running on a GTX 760 4gb) and because I do not have an AMD card or any GTX 900 series cards - the main cause for concern with this title, I can only state that it should work fine with the 700 series.  The story is lackluster at best and leaves alot to be desired; it starts to pick up pace from about half way onwards but it still is nothing to write home about. The voice acting of Crane is monotone and at times obnoxious and later on he begins to put in more emphasis when more dramatic plot points come up but equally can't save it.  The combat is basically a more refined version of Dead Island's with more fluid animations and better feeling weapons that actually have a sort of weight behind them, when you decapitate a zombie with a knife or bash its head in with a pipe the Sound, Slow-Mo and X-Ray compliment it without it being in the way of actual combat.  Atmospherically this game has nailed it - being out at night is tense, especially at the start of the game when you have barely any decent weapons, and at day when you can see everything the city is eerie yet beautiful, nothing really seems out of place. I get a sort of Resident Evil 1 vibe from it at some points where I know something will happen, but I don't know when. The horror in the game is purely atmospheric, nothing will jump out at you and scream but the enviroments and lighting (or lack there-of) can be intimidating at times.  Finally, the tone is a massive contrast to Dead Island. Where Dead Island was colourful and vibrant, this game was dark and gritty; we talk about the infamous Dead Island trailer but at times I think that the trailer for that would fit this game better - still not perfect but much better because of the tone of the game.  In Conclusion; this game is incredible - it has it's flaws, as does everything, but it is already one of the best modern games that I have played and it will take alot to top it.",

Right out of the gate the first thing you’ll notice is how gorgeous this game is, and two, it feels like a typical military first person shooter, but it’s lying. After a quick briefing from the GRE over a radio, you are then thrown into the quarantined city of Haran, Turkey. Playing as the hired agent of the GRE, Kyle Crane, your mission is to infiltrate the factions that have surfaced within the ruined city and recover stolen documents before they are published to the world, subsequently jeopardizing the research on the virus conducted by your employers.  Near the beginning of the game you get a very empty impression of how much Crane really cares about the mission, the people, or the other survivors he meets throughout the city, and this feeling never really left me until near the end. Among the survivors you meet there is a kickboxing legend named Jade, her younger reckless brother Rahim and the leader of the Tower, Brecken. As a parkour instructor, Brecken seems to have gotten stuck as the leading survivalist in this urban landscape because of his undeniable skill at movement against the mostly sluggish and hungry hordes. Crane himself is portrayed as a simple man struggling with choices between his mission and doing the right thing. This is laid on so heavily so early it was hard to even gauge him on a personal level, especially since I found a lot of his choices very contradicting and confusing at times.  The story is one of the few major things that shy away from what you can’t ignore; This game has glaring similarities to Dead Island. From the melee weapon modifications to the “safe area filled with quests”, this game beckons to it’s older brother constantly. Keeping this in mind, every similarity is improved significantly. The combat is smoother and more effective, the quests have more story, purpose, and direction, giving you more information about what has really happened to the city of Harran. There is still the occasional “Go collect this random thing” side quests, but the quest giver is appropriately amazed that you would spend your time doing something so mundane. As a stranger to the Tower, Crane feels obligated to prove himself and gain peoples trust, so these kinds of quests are justified to me.  A lot of these quests offer up blueprints for new weapon modifications that are all too valuable to you in your mission to improve the effectiveness of your tools of zombie slaughter. These mods are varied quite well, with everything from adding extra blades for bleeding effects, blow torches to the edge of your axes, and even elemental additions to throwing weapons to freeze or engulf an enemy in flames. Craft Molotov’s, throwing stars out of metal and saw blades, and special UV flares that are effective against the strongest of the infected during the night. There are tools for every circumstance available.  With all of these weapons and tools to create and choose from, I still found myself gravitating towards the same tactics I used in Dead Island; Find the sharpest thing, make it sharper, swing for the neck and head only, and stomp on stuff a lot to save it’s durability points. Even with knowing this, cutting zombies in half (vertical and horizontal) and lobbing off several heads with a single swing is even more satisfying with the critical hit slow motion and X-ray effect the game features when landing a critical hit on a body part.  The game focuses its energy almost solely on melee combat, with gunplay coming in feeling like something extra. Shooting a gun feels a bit sluggish when aiming down the sight, and at some point ammo is plentiful as you fight through waves of human bandits armed to the teeth. Even so, the game promotes the instincts to reserve firing off your guns, as it makes noise and attracts runners to your area.  I was content saving my rifle ammo for dealing with human enemies from a distance, especially towards the beginning of the game when all you had was table legs and gas pipes to fight with against the formidable human melee fighters. It reminded me of fighting in Criminal Origins, dodging left and right, avoiding kicks and swings trying to find an opening in your opponent. Once you got your Power Skill tree high enough though, it only takes a few good swings to dispatch them and you barely even notice a struggle.  In fact this game’s progression felt very smooth and rewarding, only hindered by a frustrating and unnecessary experience point loss if you die. There is a tree for your overall Survivor rank, which includes abilities like a bigger backpack, creating drugs from the local herbs and improving your bartering skills for better prices. The Agility Tree focuses on ease of movement and evasion, dodging, sliding, vaulting off and over zombies are a few of the most useful examples. Movement is important for survival, to avoid zombies of course, but also to maneuver through the intricate and hazardous landscape. This game loves to place destructive zombies near explosives, or have water near an electrical source, turning one zombies simple movement into a possible deadly mess.  The third is the Power tree, which involves your combat abilities. Stealthy executions, kicks that stun your opponent, and more powerful slams and swings with your weapons make up the majority of this tree. Both your Power and Agility trees are leveled by simply being involved in the appropriate activity. All of your progress is saved no matter who or what activity your playing, making co-op a simple and easy thing to snap in and out of with friends.  The types of things to kill are pretty typical for a zombie survival game at this point. The Biters, a slow and shambling aging zombie. The Runners, who are freshly turned and able bodied survivors who still show a disturbing level of humanity as they flinch and beg for mercy as they struggle for control over their minds. The miners, who are huge, lumbering and powerful locals who swing large and devastating pieces of buildings like a hammer. The Frogs, who regurgitate toxin from their heavily infectious insides to hurl at you with disturbing precision. The Hunters, who are player controlled zombies that can actively invade your world at night (Or at any time if you choose), starting a mad dash to kill their nests before you are devoured.  And finally there are the Volatile, who only show up during the night and will pursue you with the speed and ferocity of a starving lion. The only defense against these insane infected is their weakness to UV lighting, something invaluable to you if you dare venture into the city during the dark hours.  With the extended wait for it’s release, this game lives up to it’s initial hype. While I played this game I kept in mind what people knew it would be; A better Dead Island. And even though it has it’s few drawbacks, like a morally confusing protagonist, a map that could have been bigger and an unforgiving experience loss death penalty, it did far more for me then just improve on an old game. This is the fast paced co-op zombie survival horror game I’ve been waiting for.  ",

I played the original game + DLC to completion in about 56 hours with still quite a few achievements and collectibles to find.   My only reserve to this game is that money almost seems excessively too easy to come by without a lot to spend it on. This game or hopefully a dying light 2 will improve on this and the overall weapon crafting system.

Had some trouble in a section early/mid game with them throwing them through walls and bookshelves  I will say though, the parkour sytem is actually very responsive, in fact it's suprisingly the least buggy thing about the game. Optimization is also wonderful.  This game isn't really much of a story teller, keeping you wanting more, pursuing your objectives. It's really about running over rooftops in the slums and dropkicking zombies down the block. Even with it's bugs, it's a pretty fun game. I can see it having better replayabilty than dead island, but I still don't see myself getting much out of it a few days after completion. I'm not much of a multiplayer guy, so I can't review that.

The weapons are varied but, you will eventually pick up the same class of weapon with a different name and look so it adds to keep things mixed up a bit and with the added tier of gold weapons you will be left hunting for the best zed smasher!

It's fairly open-world (I mean, you have a whole city filled with zombies, not to mention the amazing DLC for this game). I love the mechanics (thought the driving in 'The Following' DLC could use some work, but that's just my opinion. I'm use to Mad Max driving, so that doesn't help much.) The graphics are STUNNING. The story is chilling and takes some interesting turns.   Even if you don't like zombie games that much, I would consider getting this game sometime. It's one of my favorites and I don't think I've ever had a big issue with anything about it.",

Also after not even a single quick time event the whole game, the boss battle ends up just being a series of them. Really weird design choice and made me feel cheated; I build a great arsenal to take on an epic boss battle and final showdown... and all I got were some stilted quick-time events.

It was ok.  +) Jumping, Climbing from roof to roof was exciting.   -) The zombies at the beginning makes you worried because they are Tough. For this reason Players should be notified of the fact that they won't get stronger and they will be easier and easier as you grow and loot. I mean the moment you lay your swing on the first zombie you see devastates you.  -) Making you jump and climb needlessly just to level your agility level was Ridiculous. They should've either combined agility to survivor level or just get rid of it.  -) Having limited repair count for every melee weapon was a buzzkill, if so then the number should've been more higher. You can't really start a blood raining kill with ease not because you're worried of dying but because you're worried that your weapons are going to go down one by one.  -) You so rarely get to interact with the characters. You can not get emotionally attatched to any of them. The best one you'll get is Rahim and you don't even get to interact with him enough. This leads to no heart towards the game. You're just playing it because you want to play it and we are all done with this level.  -) Crane is such a downer. He is so pessimistic, arrogant, and worst: ignorant. He always looks down on people, judging them and treating them like they're all weird and negative. Did he came from wonderalnd? People have problems in their life and when they talk about it he criticizes them for being down and negative. What a child. It was really hard to endure Crane's attitude. This is really problematic because if this is the character that game industry is going to produce, they're just basically trying to ruin this amazing industry. There are good people, honorable people, heroic people, descent people, humble people, generous people enjoying games and I do not want to see them remotely being considered as this pessimistic character.  -) What the heck is wrong with the ending? Make a stance. Don't take a raincheck. Finish the story. Dont' hang it in the air. You didn't spend months and months of your valuable time and effort for mediocre.     --------------------------------------- The Following ---------------------------------------  +) It was really good to see Crane's annoying attitude gone. +) It was good to know that they tried to make up for their insufficient ending. +) Seeing some new dangerous areas was enjoyable.   -) If you went through the main campaign, by the time you play this you're almost done with Dying Light. You don't want to drive minutes just to finish a quest. What annoyed me more was that they made the quest far far away intentionally as if they wanted you to suffer. That's not all, the cars break. It has parts that need to be fixed as you crash and not just that, as you drive those parts wary out. That is all unnecessary and ridiculous.  -) It was obvious at the beginning that this is 'the magic side' that you experienced in the end of main campaign being brought out more directly but as you play, you realize it was just a joke.  -) Last two choices that are given to you was disappointing. It should've been 'No' being what it already is and 'Yes' being the migical side as in the mother actually extracts some kind of cure out of Crane's dead body and saves Harran in the end.",

I'm glad I revisited this masterpiece.  There are several side missions for you to do in this big open world. You're free to roam where you want. The play is superb, the running, vaulting and climbing is very fluid. The game looks beautiful. The AI of the zombies is pretty good. The crafting system is deep enough.   Often times you'll be surprised, having one of the undead on top of you with just barely enough time to react. It will all come down to your fight or flight instinct, in several of the situations that occur in this game. You'll need to assess the sitution, and either try to run, or kill.

You can find yourself kissing the ground of the safe zones at times, having just escaped from Death in the form of a grotesque humanoid or demonic-looking creature. You and it - looking at one another, seperated only by the razor's edge. You'll realize that you're safe for now, but you'll also quickly realize that you can't hide forever.

I also love that unlike other zombie games where your goal is to kill every zombie you see, in this game that sort of thinking will probably get most killed. Forcing one to think of other ways to do things.  A definite con to the game though is a two parter. The be the zombie mode, combined with cheaters/hackers. I'm not one to shy away from a challange, but when you go against another player who is using mods/cheats/hacks to gain an unfair advantage because they don't like to lose, that becomes a problem. One could vac secure their game, but that only stops some of them. The others who have managed to avoid being vac banned while cheating/hacking will still come in to ruin your fun becaue they find it funny.

You also get a skill tree with awsome skills that you can unlock such as wall run and drop kick, with these set of skills you can become the legend of harran. Theres so much to talk about and I dont want to give out too much so these are my final words . . .Its a Mother ♥♥♥♥ing badass zombie killing game that you can ♥♥♥♥ up as many zombies as you wish",

The enemies got repetitive, but once the rhythm of evasion was found they weren't worth fighting. Same-old-same-old areas were balanced with finding firearms and eventually the grappling hook. Think Spider-Man among zombies, for the surfaces that allowed using it.  Nighttime was impossible to get through, though, and had my heart racing during the first forced level of it. Protip: Sleep until dawn in safehouses, then slog through to the obejective.  I hung in until the 'bittersweet' end, as the achievement called it, but I'm not compelled to revisit the city or play the expansion. I got enough of vehicular zombiecide in Dead Island.

Certain quests require you to turn in regular items (not flagged as quest only key items) and they just take whatever from your inventory, sometimes stealing your favourite weapon. Easy enough to avoid but, an annoying little issue nonetheless. Multiplayer/Co-op experience so far has been limited, but thats mainly because of the lack of people to connect to for some reason.

But facing Vas... i mean Rais and his chum, Curry (Karim) was interesting to say the least...  Be ready to have your ♥♥♥ handed to you by the zombies at night time in the beginning of the game... But you'll eventually be able to take care of those s**s of b****es as you progress in the game.. Although there weren't many memorable characters in the game a few did stand out (Gas mask man, Gunsmith, etc.) ... The combat system was good and the parkour was well implemented....   I don't recommend this game to be played alone but this is a great game to play with your friends...  Since i live in india i got the game for 20 dollars with all the dlc on release day (courtesy of Flipkart)...  I'm now waiting for the 'additional content' that the devs have promised to add in their game (vehicles, etc). Let's see if they live up to expectations....",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty epic! There is only a few things that kind of bug me - how quickly melee weapons break and that they only have a limited number of repairs, and the fact that your character is a bit too much of an uber bad ♥♥♥. Things like jumping sideways from ledge to ledge is just kind of ridiculous, but hey, thats not too much of a big deal. Also, unlockable abilities like ground pound and such are also a bit outrageous but its very easy to look past those.  One thing Id really like to see is a single player only mode, similar to other games like Halo, CoD, etc. If you hit a check point and die or quit the game, you restart at the same spot you were and what ever state the world was in is retained - enemies and items do not respawn. Or just allow player to save when ever they feel like, same as Stalker and such.  Over all, however, this game is extremely enjoyable. I love that you always have the choice to fight your way through or evade enemies, the day/night, relatively safe/almost suicide cycle is also great, you can level up which ever way you want to fit your style. There is a lot of exploration to do, you can choose to plan your day when you go out and try to complete missions, or just run around and see what happens and explore.  Even though there are things that kind of annoy me, I think this game is worth the pretty high price.",

            "review_text": "So I will start by saying the parkour system in here is a lot of fun. Makes it incredibly fun(and frustrating at times when you die) to just run around the city. The combat system is also pretty good, not anything incredibly special but the dismemberment is very visceral and satisfying. The general gameplay of this game is great and a lot of fun to play, the story however is not. This game has a lot of features of rpgs(skill trees, loot, etc) but it has non of the great story telling you might associate with rpgs. The story at best was dissappointing and at a lot of times, just plain infuriating to me. It is a sad sign when I think a lot of the side quests are better written than the main story line. There are many problems with the story ranging from trying to force you to have emotional connections with characters you have met 2 to 3 times total, to a mediocre villian on a pedestal. To me it seems they tried to make a villian similiar to vaas from far cry 3, and in my opinion didn't come close to capturing the charm that vaas had.  The few problems I had with gameplay were that after a certain point, your agility level would level a lot slower than your other skill trees, and I feel like they simply needed to boost the amount of agility experience that you got later on in the game to compensate for this. Additionally while most of the game is entirely able to be played in co-op, the finale of the game is not. This was a fact that I did not appreciate at all, don't have the ability to do every other part of the game with your friends, and then force you into a single player mission. I understand why they did it from a design perspective, but they could just have easily done everything in it as co-op and then had a cutscene. Even with all the problems I had with the story that I will not bother to write about, I would still recommend this game as it is a fun time running through the city. It is even more fun if you have some friends to play it with. I would like to see another dying light game, but with a vastly improved story, and perhaps one where you as the character got to make decisions rather than just being on rails.  Overall I enjoyed this game and recommend it, I am giving it an 7.5/10 as the gameplay is just fantastic and overall this should cause the game to be an 8.5+, but thanks to the story it has recieved a lower score as the further i got into the story the less I enjoyed the game.",

From parkour to crafting to combat this game is easy to grasp and never overcomplicated. It looks great visually and it sounds great (well, I hate the music, but sound effects and voices are top notch). It's challenging, rewarding, and just all around fun to play.   As I don't play zombie games as a rule, I really couldn't say whether or not this is the best zombie game ever made . I find it hard to think that it isn't though, because this is a great game period.  If I have any major gripes about this game it's the exploding zombies. They are an instant kill and too powerful. They move very quickly and are often placed as no win traps, that is you'll come across spots where they will kill you no matter what and you can't avoid it. An example would be several times I had to pick the lock of a door to advance a quest and as soon as you open the door these things explode and kill you instantly. This game could REALLY do without thst, it's a dickl move by the devs to do tis.",

However thats not to say that this game is a waste. No this game picks up in a very different way. I really like the free running system, Its shameful that there are not more games with this mechanic. Makes you feel a bit more free. If you are comming here for a story then ill just say that it is a loose story not one that is typically enthralling.  This game is built around an all too familiar premise, and it feels to me like we have all been there so many times before. But what the hell, I didnt come here for premise and story I came to kick some zombie ♥♥♥. So that is what I did. If you find this on sale really worth it.   One thing about this game that pisses me off is the DLC that adds another weapon to it. When the full relase game had achievements for a bow yet you have to have the DLC to get it.

My first night run in Dying Light was THE best experience Ive ever had playing a video game.  Seeking a challenge I had my settings on the highest difficulty with Zombie Invasion on Always.  This was a mistake.  Following the end of the cutscene of your first volatile encounter I ran into three volatiles within 30 seconds of running. Panicking, I ran into the heart of the city. This was also a mistake. There was no light Whatsoever and I walked into a steet, FILLED with infected, their figures could only be seen as eerie silouettes in the moonlight. I took to the roofs as quickly as possible, so as to use the moonlight to plot a path, My heart pounding in my chest as I could hear the volatiles snarling behind me barely missing me as I scrambled onto the roofs. There must have been 5+ volatiles chasing me, I had one medkit left, and I didnt pack any diapers.  I ran like never before. Addrenaline coursing through me, I ran at top speed, never missing a step. I could almost feel the cool night air running through my hair. But the volatiles are relentless. I could hear their snarling and breathing getting louder and louder as they slowly caught up to me. I missed a precision jump (mechanics for which are done perfectly in the game ) and plummeted into the dark abyss of the streets below.  I kept running, it was all I could do, taking sharp turns in alleyways and vaulting the smaller obstacles, as packs of zombies clawed at me, tugging my shirt, slowing me down and damaging me where they could. Despite slowing down to use my final medkit I was gaining ground. Laughing at the insanity that is night running.  Until I hit a dead end.  In a moment of brilliance, I remembered the Light. The UV flashlight, Spikes words echoing in my mind 'If you run into one of those volatiles give them a blast of UV light'. I spun around and shined the light directly in the face of a volatile, making full eye contact with one of the grotesque husks of a being that had been chasing me, before it recoiled from the light. The sight of it still haunts me to this day. I was not bothered by its rotting flesh or jagged teeth, but rather the look in its bloodshot eyes. It almost looked ...not happy, but content as if it somehow knew my situation was hopeless.  Time seemed to slow down as I kicked the creature in its exposed ribcage, frantically searching for a way out. There it was. A single perfect ramp angling toward an adjacent roof. Without hesitation I pushed past the creature as 2 more arrived to seal the alleyway, each hitting me in turn. With 17HP I somehow slipped between them, ran up the ramp and back onto the moonlit rooftops. I could hear my own panting in tune with Kranes as we ran towards the MASSIVE suspension bridge.  There must have been hundreds of zombies on that bridge. I ran, jumping car to car, knowing that with one wrong step, I would surely perish. I kept running, night blind. My path barely visible in the low flames of wrecked cars. I tripped and scrambled, screamed and prayed, desperately trying to get off that god forsaken bridge. I ran and ran until I reached the center of the bridge, which had been destroyed, presumably in order to quarantine the area. There was no way out, in front there was nothing but a hole in the bridge, looming what seemed like a thousand meters over pitch black water. To my rear the volatiles had caught up with me, now within 20 meters. I took one last look at the murky black water and jumped. I saw the distant UV lights of a settlement when I finally surfaced and began the long swim back.   I managed to get back to the tower that night, counting my blessings. For I doubt many others could've survived that run.   10/10 I've never been so terrified and exhilirated. Gameplay at higher levels becomes even more fun and faced pace. Skill trees are creative and progressive. Looting system is a mix of skyrim (lockpicking), farcry (body animations) and thief (object animations), which is fantastic. (you really feel pressed for time lockpicking while firecrackers etc are distracting them and you can be hurt grabbing objects encouraging grab and gtfo style looting. Story so far is MUCH better than anticipated. Graphics are AMAZING (If you get motion sick, turn off depth of field and motion blur :))  Fantastic Game, would buy again.  If anyone reads all of this and wants to go on a night run with me, send me a message. I cant wait to try multiplayer.",

            "review_text": "Since Dying Lights initial announcement many years ago, I have always been looking forward to this game. As a big fan of the dead island series, I knew that I would love this game when it finally came out. After a few years followed with one or two delays, I can happily say this game was worth the wait.   Whilst it's launch was a little choppy in some areas, mainly regarding the multiplayer in my personal experience, for the most part it has been very smooth and it's fair to say that it has had a much more sucessful launch than that of other games recently. It only took me 5 minutes of tweaking a few settings to get a performance that I considered acceptable to play with, with my system just over recommended specs I certainly have smooth performance, with the exception of a few FPS drops here and there and a little video stuttering, however it doesn't really remain much of an issue.  If you were a fan of the dead island franchise as well as Mirrors Edge, chances are you will quickly fall in love with this game, it's combining the two as well as adding more content. It may look like very similar gameplay to that of Dead Island, however I felt that when playing the fluency of the parkour system, the setting, the plot and the story, characters and overall content just made the game feel so much more dynamic and direct with the player. In addition, the day/night cycle is incredible. Firstly, ignore anyone that says it's fixed. It's not, the cycle is 100% dynamic, some quests (the prologue) just set it to night or such to introduce the setting. But once your out of the prologue, it's 100% dynamic. Me and my friend at first thought night was just sort of a little gimicky selling point, it was only until we were on a mission collecting chocolates for some guy that we were warned night was coming, and when it did we were gone pretty quickly. Do not take the night cycle as a gimick, it's very unique, works very well and adds so much more the game. You don't have to play through it, you can skip it (sleep). However, i advise you try playing through night, through it's encoruagement of double xp and the changes you are forced to undertake to simply survive. You cannot go all out, you will fail and die almost every time. You must plan around the infected to achieve anything, stay hidden, use UV wisely and such. It feels like an entirly different game at times during the night.  Overall, well I don't think I have enjoyed the launch of a game so much in the past 2 or 3 so years, with the last being Far Cry 3. This game is simply fantastic and I cannot wait to see what they have planned for the future. With a few issues for me perosnally here and there (that is just my experience, not to be conflicted with that of others) Techland have pulled this off very well. I recommend you buy this, 100%. Worth it's money. Great game. So much fun whatever you end up doing, plenty of funny and shocking moments. Hilarious and addictive with friends.  10/10 for me personally and my own opinon.",

On the other hand the zombie models are cut n paste speacil of the day kind of deal, they could have had way more verity of them instead there looks to be about maby 15 different zombie skins and about 5 or 6 different regular zombie models: Which leaves that to be desired.   So far not very far in the story line im about 8% into it done all ythe side quest there is up to the point im at, so they deffiently did alright there story is typical go get me this and u can have that kind of thing atm, which is fine.   Realy what gets ya is playing at nite, realy draws you in with all the sound effects and the constant peril of your going to be ripped to peaces realy gets your heart going, which is right on par with what they say about 'During the day your the hunter and at night u become the hunted!' which is realy fun!  Over all i would totaly recommend if u have a half decent video card, I'm running a ASUS GTX 760 Direct CU II OC and its just not up to snuff to play it on max but i can at least play it ona slightly lower resalution and have the settings cranked, so to wrap this up u need a damn good card lol.  So in short its a great n fun game if you love choping Zombie heads n limbs off lol and interesting story line thus far. have and will recommend as a buy if your into these games!",

Dying Light introduces parkour into a zombie apocalypse, and it makes the rpg experience so much fun. The animations are smooth and transition without hitches, to where you can go from running on rooftops to drop kicking zombies into spiked traps, to using the heads of the infected as a means of transportation. After a point in the game, you acquire a grappling hook, which adds an element of verticality to the game, and greatly speeds up the action in the game,   The melee system from Dead Island has been cleaned up, and feels great. The upgrade skills you get can give you unique options to kill zombies other than 'wackig with bat'  The graphics are great, with amazing visual and audio feedback, zombies *feel fun* to cut and slice, and the elemental effects are amazingly visceral. The game runs pretty well, even on lower end machines.  The story is cliche and forgettable with the cast of zombie survivor tropes, and a bunch of plot holes. Fortunatly, there are plenty of side quests and activities that can increase your playtime.  Dying Light's gimmick is that you can play either in the daytime or nighttime, and these have different playstyles. During the day, you get to enjoy Harran in all its beauty. However in the night, zombies become more active and dangerous, creating a much more intense experience.   I do have some gripes especially with some of the mobs (exploding zombies in particular), which seemed to be placed in trolly locations and stop the zombie mayhem with insta-kill mechanics. Some of the later side quest these jerks are placed in closets, and will insta-kill you when you are trying to finish a quest.  Overall, Dying Light is the best zombie-action game on the market and worth checking out.  Reccomendede",

It means I have a great taste in games. ;) I'm only kidding, or am I? I'm just starting off in this game. Have about 14 hours already. I bought the deluxe or enhanced or whatever it is called of this game for $60 just about a month ago. 14 hours may not seem like much but it is also because I like jumping around on the games that I do own. So what can I say about this one? I was a fan of Dead Island and if you happen to love that game, then you will love this. I think this one is a little more brutal and gory. Then again, I just recently switched to playing on the PC. I was a console gamer not too long ago so it could be that Dead Island on the PC is just as gory. Graphics aside, yes this game is great. I feel pretty weak starting off especially when a random stranger decides to join in on your game and is twice as good as you. I don't mind though, knowing how powerful I can eventually become later on. I do believe at night it is a little too dark for my liking. So I try and avoid any playtime then unless I'm doing a quest. It could be my monitor and it could be the game itself. Basically that is my only grip in this fantastic game. I definitely recommend it, if you are willing to throw down $60 that is. :)",

Dying Light is one of those rare games that delivers on the promises it made. While this is an excellent plus, it is tempered by the fact that Dying Light didn't promise much more than 'Roof-top, running from zombies (Parkour system) &amp; a differing level of challenge between day and night.  The game is overall well put together, and is a solid purchase, I have only two complaints, which make up the majority of my negatives.  1 - Long breaks in the narrative, especially the last 10 or so hours. I love story, it is for me the primary aspect I look for in a game. While Dying light has a decent story, which seems to have been stretched from a 10 hour narrative to a 20 hour one.  2 - The second issue, is really a case of nit picking. There is an item that you get much later in the game. I won't spoil it, but this item fundamentally changes the way you can navigate and avoid zombies. Access to this item should have happened way sooner than the last few missions.  This is a long game for its type, I'm a slow player and the story took me almost 30 hours. Anyone looking to get dollar value from an AAA title can do a lot worse than Dying Light ",

Especially in the beginning when your buggy is a piece of crap. Just metal bars, tires and an engine and that's pretty much it. It goes only 20 to 30mph at start. So expect to die a lot. And yea it's a very brutal difficulty setting. Not for the faint of heart. The Following is a very big map. But I havent been back to the base game since I started playing. It's very addictive with the new weapons and new graphics. And being able to customize your buggy to your liking, You become very protective of your buggy and if someone is near it, you get defensive. It's pretty cool. Story line is very short but interesting. I have yet to do any bounties or side quests. Having too much fun running over zombies with my buggy. Anyways I totally recommend the Enhanced Edtion. Totally worth every penny. You won't disappoint. No one I know wants to go back to the base game yet. Oh and before I forget the 250 Legend levels after you rank up your main levels. Wow you become very OP (Over Powered) in case someone doesn't know what that means. When you're fully ranked up the game is SOOO much easier to deal with. But that's all I'll say before I start spoiling things and I don't want to that. Get the game. Ignore the haters. Good Night, Good Luck....and Good Hunting.",

Guns are available, as is the ammo. And they work much better than they did in Dead Island. Other than the main quest there is a decent amount of side quests, repeatable quests and challenges to keep you interested and earn experience.

            "review_text": "I've put 67 hours (as of this writing) into this game, and I've won it twice. Dying Light is a step above the common zombie game due to a few factors:  - Parkour mechanics - Night/Day cycle - Focus on stealth and silence to avoid more powerful/faster zombies (known as virals)  After 60+ hours and two wins I can say this is definitely a game to keep and a game to explore. There are a lot of little details that might escape your notice the first time around. Parkour challenges, quarantine zones, and awesome rewards in unique and difficult-to-reach places give you a reason to keep looking beyond the linear 'go to the next spot'.  Unlike a lot of zombie games where the focus is never being bit, you start out infected. This lessens the fear factor a bit because now you don't have to worry about infection and zombies become more like rabid animals to be put down. That doesn't mean that you're invulnerable. At night the zombies become stronger and faster, and new types of zombies come out that patrol the streets. Wait out the night in a Safe Zone or take to the rooftops and earn double the experience.  You play the role of Kyle Crane, a GRE operative from Chicago, IL, who has landed in the middle of the Harran quarantine in order to find a stolen file with data on the virus. Along the way you'll make new friends, complete quite a few humerous side quests, and explore two huge, unique zones in your quest to not only find the stolen data but decide just what you want to do with it.  Pros: - Parkour mechanics that are super smooth and fun - Interesting day/night cycle that make you question each quest 'Can I finish this one before it grows dark?' - Hundreds of interesting quests, challenges, quarantine zones, and little tidbits to find - 3-path talent system lends itself to multiple play styles. Fast, 1H melee, 2H smasher, quick and agile stealth, etc.  - A very wide variety of craftable boosters, weapons, and traps for any play style  Cons: - Story is predictable. There was not one twist or turn I didn't forsee. - No choices in the storyline. In the end, it always goes the same way. You have the choice of when you want to do each quest, but the end result is the same.  If you want to try something new in the zombie genre, the game is definitely recommended, if you can get past the predictable story.",

An enjoyable game to jump and run around in with the parkour, even in multiplayer you don't get too left behind because if someone gets too far ahead they can just smack up a few zombies to kill some time. The constant individual levelling up of Survival, Strength and Agility (more or less) keeps things fun, with skill trees for all three with some pretty fun abilities to look forward to. I personally didn't get the Dropkick ability until the end of the game but it was pretty fun to use, so experiment a bit and try some different styles in the skills. With the day/night gameplay cycle keeping things fresh and dangerous, you can open your game to 'invasions'. At night, powerful enemies can appear and if you so choose, other players can appear as a powerful zombie and you can have an offence/defence style fight throughout the midnight hours, with some intense and fun times to be had. The story hold up enough and the main protagonist is a fun guy to play as, sometimes rolling his eyes at the same things the player is. I would recommend this game quite a lot.",

Played multiplayer some. It was fun but gives way too many advantages to the night hunter. Playing the night hunter is easy to beat people 1 on 3 most of the time. That is in base mode before you level him. Once leveled he is just silly and winning is pretty easy.  Definitely reccomend if you like this kind of genre. Worth the time and worth a play through.

The zombies are really well balanced, there's some that can run/climb but they are generally attracted by sound, the others will come after you if you are nearby but you can easily outrun them.  Starting out in the game is really tough. The game has a skill-based system which means that you have three areas to gain experience in - agility (running/general parkour), power (killing stuff), survival (quests, crafting, not entirely sure). These each have their own skill trees that you use throughout the game to get upgrades. The upgrades are great and definitely worth the time invested in getting them (especially the grappling hook late game).  The story is okay. It's not incredible, but it's still enjoyable. I'm enjoying the quests themselves more than the backstories behind them, which I'm fine with in an action-based game.   The game includes a crafting system which isn't shoved down your throat, Basically while you're running around doing quests you'll run into buildings with crates or toolboxes and you can loot stuff from those, or from zombie corpses, etc. You can then use the loot for crafting things like medkits to weapon upgrades. Blueprints are found throughout the map or rewarded through missions which is pretty cool too.  In terms of difficulty, this game can be easy at some points, but also incredibly intense at other points, especially during the night. I'm not going to go into detail here because I'll be spoiling it. ;) I haven't even gotten into the co-op modes but I'm definitely looking forward to it once some friends start playing.  Onto the most important part to some people - performance. This game runs at a rock solid 60FPS... except for when there's a lot of fire, then it dips to 40ish. I don't know why this is, but I would love for it to get fixed in the future.  All in all, I'm really happy with my purchase. Running around, killing zombies, looting stuff, and getting upgrades is incredibly fun. The map is really well designed and there's many things to do. Lots of replayability. I'd highly recommend this game. If you're still hesitant to buying it, give the demo a try.",

Excellent story/plot executed flawlessly. 2-4 player coop done right (If you join a game only the quests you already have will complete, the main quest line will be where you left off. Experience and loot is carried over so its worth doing. The parkour is PERFECT, even better then Mirrors Edge was, on top of that the grappling hook is so effective, fun, and useful that its my favorite item in the game.  I really enjoy the leveling system used, seperating power / agility / survivor, with talents to pick for all 3. The combat is smooth, and the weapon you're using greatly influences the way you attack. With a handful of different types of zombies its the perfect amount to be capable of recognizing them before they're on top of you, yet still enough diversity that you could be surprised.  At first glance I figured I enjoyed the game because theres just a lot of small things that add up and allow for an experience that doesn't frustrate you, but definitely won't bore you either. I realize now that it's more than that. The game is very carefully designed to never feel repetitive or come to a point where you feel like you've done everything and have nothing left to do because once fully completing it, one can focus on the multiplayer Night Hunter events that can leave you more satisfied then you've ever felt or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that things went bad. There's better rewards for ranking up and winning these matches.  The final piece of the game worth noting is the way you can have fun and just relax by exploring the map..looting..killing zombies..etc, very similar to why people play the older GTA games still.",

The ability to slice up zombies, blow them to pieces, and go on massive parkour runs throughout the city provide for a thrilling experience.  Pros: - Looks great - Plays great - Great, likable protagonist and characters - Tons of parkour - Lots to do outside of the main storyline - Plenty of weapons to choose from and weapon mods - Leveling up and skill trees - Great co-op - Optional challenges if you want to get competitive with your friends  Cons:   I can't think of any.

Some of the best parts of the game are -  1)The best thing about the game is Parkour ! Parkour system in Dying light is soo fluid and you will have hours of fun just running around and smacking zombies . There are even many different parkour moves to master 2)Story is pretty solid , even the side missions are not boring  3)Zombie and human AI are not sloppy and well finished 4)Graphics are awesome  5)Many variety of zombies to kill 6)Day and night cycle 7)Crafting system is also good , you can add poison , electricity , fire and impact on your melee weapons 8)Difficulty is well maintained throughout the game 9)Grappling hook :D  So overall , this is a very well built zombie game and you should buy it now if you love exploding heads and dismembering limbs XD . Also one advice , buy the following dlc , it is well worth your money and time with tons of new features , location and zombies + the buggy which is very fun to crush zombies with :P",

            "review_text": "Had i written this 10 hours into the game, it would have been one, uninterrupted praise. It still kinda is but later some problems in the story telling emerge.  Pro:  It's a wonderful mixture or Assassons Creed, Far Cry and Mirrors Edge. It has a huge and interesting open world, good fighting system, reasonably dangerous zombies in impressive quantities (hello dayz). And fun tools and abilities to deal with them. Once you skilltrained™ out of the hide-and-run-away phase. And it's not just an action/fighting/parcoury game, with an open world to play in, but very story driven and quite a lot of RPG added, to make it very nteresting and motivating and unique. Which also sets it apart from Far Cry and some of the later Assassins creeds.  Also some of the side quests are quite remarkably in style, emotional storytelling and athmosphere, and an absolute highlight of the game. Like the kindergardener with his wife... don't want to spoil it.  That makes it (for an action game) very special and unique and makes more then up for the small glitches in the main story i'm adressing now.  You could even argue that, if Fallout 4 passes for an RPG, Dying Light does as well or even more.  Con: So what's my problems?  1. It's the tools and drive of the (main)storytelling. Several times during the story script-events, you can not influence, put you in situations you could've easily escaped. For example you're suddenly made to surrender to 2 people with guns, you'd normally kill or beat up in a few moments,  Just to make the following boss fight more difficult and frustrating (completely artificially AND unfairly) than it should be.  It made me so angry, i cheated back at the game at this point :-)  2. Also at times and with no explanation parts of the game mechanics, like grapple hook, the bow or special abilites, are simply... disabled to to make a situation artificially more difficult. That's just bad game design.  3. Towards the end (?),Story and main quests feels AWFULLY strechted out. Feels you're close to the end for FAR too long now.  The thing is: that's completely unnecessary. At this point, the game is far longer already then action games these days usually are. And it gets there in a very good, interesting and motivating way. There would be no shame in closing the story in style to a satisfying end.  Instead they started to turn buildings into labyrinths, let you check 5 instead of 1 or 2 locations for a quest, send you in circles for them.   4. Also i feel that unlike in Far Cry, the stealthy approach, the game kinda offers, doesn't really work, too many psychic enemies, you can't hide from. ___________ It has a online mode, i don't use and therefore can't judge. The times when they got people VAC banned for single player mods are gone, i think. They got rightfully a lot of flak for this BS mechanics. ___________  Still: I edited the review, as it sounded more omplainy than the game deserves. Cause at the bottom line: __________________________________________________________ It's VERY VERY good game for a very long time, just loses it's drive a bit later on. Rather do more side quests then rush though the main story without ever looking left and right, or you miss out badly.  It beats several well known fulll-on RPGs in this area.",

Still, it isn't enough to not recommend this game. It's almost perfect for what the developers were trying to accomplish and I feel like this game was really underrated for 2015. If you love zombie games and/or action RPGs this is for you. Plus there's a sweet Plants vs. Zombies Easter Egg that kind of comes out of left field so +1 Techland.

They are good. Controllers just suck (inb4 PC master race). So, having tried both methods of playing the game, do not, for the love of your sanity, use a controller, it is far too imprecise for this game.  So, this is by far the best zombie game I've ever played, it's Dead Island done right with some great Parkour. The Story is a little bland (substitute GRE for Umbrella Corporation from Resident Evil or Phenotrans from Dead Rising and you get the idea) but WHO CARES! This game is loads of fun, long, addictive and even more fun with friends. It's got my vote for Zombie game to date and if you don't pick it up while it's on sale, you're doing yourself a disservice.",

Third time downloaded; I sent an email to Techland the first time I downloaded it and told them about my issues, I got a response where they suggested I'd delete the game completely from Steam and try to install it from scratch again.  Fourth time downloaded; 11 Corrupt files, had to download them again, ♥♥♥♥ that. Reinstall.  FIFTH time downloading as we speak. What the ♥♥♥♥ is going on?

I had heard the name Dying Light, and i knew it was a zombie game, so i downloaded it. I really didnt expect to have this much fun with it.   Graphics: Simply put, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. The atmosphere, the debris, the dust gliding through the air. Everything looks very beautiful. While there are occasional lighting bugs, i can say with confidence that they are rare, and do not effect the game whatsoever.   Gameplay: A lot of games try to go for parkour in their game, because its 'cool'. Mirrors Edge comes to mind, and that game was fun. But then i remember games like Brink, that completely tanked, because the parkour just wasnt well done or well implemented. But this game does it fantastically. When running from rooftop to rooftop, it feels natural and extremely fun. And when you start leveling up, thats when you can really take advantage of the beautiful city that was created.   DLC: So The Following basically removes the free running aspect, and replaces it with cars. Normally, i wouldnt like it, since the free running was so well done. But i have to say, they really worked to make the car mechanic feel extremely good. It honestly doesnt feel like a DLC Mechanic. I can't say much for the DLC story, besides i dont like the ending  All in all, a great game, and i would reccomend this game to anyone",

            "review_text": "After 140 hours of complesive play, I can write a defenitive review.  ---SIMPLE WORDS FOR WHO DOSEN'T WANT TO READ A LONG REVIEW--- You should buy it? Yes, preferably during the sales.  ---COMPLETE REVIEW--- Gameplay: the strong point where dying light get it right: good combat system, integrated with excelent crafting (weapos, items, upgrades for the weapons) and a sufficent amount of side missions/challenges (like the Contamination areas, now that they are replayable). And a great help, if you want, from other players, with the multiplayer. Talking about multiplayer, the hunter invasions system (check out yourself, i don't want to make the review even longer) it's great, to keep the longevity factor, by competing with other players; i know that some pepole thinks that the player/hunter (it depends) it's too OP for the enemy.  With the player being OP, it's only a matter of skill and by not going complete assault mode and thinking about the strategy: only then, the humans can't escape. And the recent update brought new ability (again, look it up yourself) that balance a little the situation. The only thing that they get wrong is abilitating the EXPalibur in the hunter matches... it's just too OP. Talking about the Hunter being OP, again, it's a matter of skill, but you have to be active and ready everytime, other than having a great weapon (but please... DON'T USE the EXPalibur. Thank you! :) ) The map it's pretty big, and trust me, there's a lot of easter eggs there.  Techinc: the game engine used it's simply spetactural: it run so smooth (gtx 780, 60 fps/second) at max settings and the graphic it's amazing. Enough said, take it or watch some videos if you want to know how it is.  Story: the downside of the game it's his story: i know that I can't have high expectation about it, but I didn't excpect such a mediocre and boring plot (and... THE ♥♥♥♥ING QUICKTIME EVENT IN THE FINAL BATTLE! Com on!). Anyway, no spoilers in this review, so, even if the plot is predictable, i wont' talk about it too much.  Bozak DLC: I didn't buy the DLC, but seen a lot of videos about it. I just say, if you buy this game, don't take this particualr DLC. It's just some boring timed challenge, but pretty frustrating ones; not because of the difficulty, but because, if you die 3 times, you have to restart the WHOLE thing.  Final though: So, first i was gonna give this game a 8.5/10, but, after thinking about the story and this s*****y Bozak DLC, I give this game a 7.5/10 Anyway, if you have the money, it's worth it take it maybe when there's the sales (oh... there's the summer sales... MY WALLET!),  UPDATE #1: A little update of this review in date 19/04/2016 Now there are great DLC to play, like the gigantic The following expansion/side story. I just love to drive around 'n' smash some heads. Again, only weak point of this, it's the ending: they fixed it up a little, by not using an QTE system, but it doesn't make sense if they want other expansions or sequels. After 'The following', I change my final vote to a solid 9/10, thanks to the outstanding rebalancing of the hunter mode too.  Hope this review was usefull. Good night and good luck!",

PROS:   The game is beautiful. It has stunning scenery, great lighting and is well thought out in all 3 dimensions.   The parkour aspect is entertaining especially early-on when you have limited combat options and later-on when you dont feel like fighting because you are on your way from A to B   The side-quests don't feel like McGuffin hunts, they feel like you are actually part of this messed up city   Although the story is predictable in general, it is mostly free flowing and enjoyable.   NEUTRAL:   Fighting is clunky and unintuitive, i understand that this is a specific choice by the Devs to emphasise the parkour aspect but i never felt comfortable with the fighting.   Why does the bow have a range of 10m? The bow must be made of cheap plastic or something!   NEGATIVE:   The major story-line is plagued with boss fights like the infamous ones in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The Boss fights require you to use almost the opposite aspects of the game (fighting over parkour &amp; avoiding) and it is like you need a completely different mind-set to take them on.   The 'escape levels' are just lame-@rse BS... suddenly you have to run, in the dark, against massively over-matched foes and need to keep dying until you learn the exact route you are supposed to take - god, i wish i could have just space-bar'd my way past these rubbish levels.   After the game is played through the final 'fight' is a series of Quick-time events... are you f#cking kidding me? Did the devs try to shove as many game-mechanics as they could into the campaign just for the hell of it?   The Biggest PRO for me - You regularly had moments where you were genuininely on the edge of your seat as you got stuck in a bad fight or were racing back to a safe house as darkness approached. To keep that level of tension up all the way through the game is pretty impressive and it was enough to entice me to stay and play on through to completion even with the things i did not like about DL The Biggest CON for me - the  insta-deaths  through mistiming jumps, through the Infected suddenly laying into you because of the issues with the combat system. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ escape-level insta-deaths because you did not memorise the paths properly from the previous 5 insta-deaths.  I bought the whole series for $20 and am yet to play DL: The Following. I MIGHT replay this game despite its various frustrations and i would have to give it a 6/10. The Great parts are fantastic whilst the problems are just plain annoying and lame.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Overall this game get's a 9/10 from me, and I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys survival-horror games. A truly top-quality production.  Detailed Thoughts:   I honestly didn't know if I was going to find another well-written, polished survival-horror game or series I liked as much as the Dead Space franchise. I've tried a great many and mildly enjoyed most for different reasons, but I just couldn't find anything that fired on all cylinders for me like that. Until I picked up Dying Light.  I can't overpraise this game. It has everything I've always wanted in a zombie game. Great story, amazing graphics, beautifully-designed environment, excellent dialogue, in-depth crafting system, combat that never gets old (for me at least), and an ever-present creeping tension you never quite get used to. A tension that keeps you looking over your shoulder and often turns to raw fear in the middle of a night sequence or when a corroded zombie *pops* and you hear the wail of incoming Virals. Now, I'm no coward. I simply enjoy allowing a horror game's atmosphere to overwhelm me, and this game did that and more. I never play games like these with the lights on, with friends, or without headphones. I do what I can to let the game get the best of me; the way I feel it's meant to be played.  And the parkour. I didn't know I needed this so much until Techland gave it to me. It blends wonderfully into this style of game. When you get all your gadgets and skills unlocked the city becomes your playground and you can pick and choose when you want to fight or preserve your best weapons. Many aspects of it enhance the depth of the combat greatly.  The skill and character progression has an impactful feeling to it. Where you start out beating one zombie to death with 15 swings from a rusted pipe, you'll end with an electric broadsword that beheads 3-4 zombies at a time with one swing. The combat is full of surprising details too. Using an electric weapon while its raining is more effective and will shock an enemy far more often. Or you can douse a tough enemy with flammable liquid and poke them once or twice with a tiny, flame-imbued knife and set them ablaze letting it do all the work. There are guns in the game, but ammo is scarce until you hit The Following expansion. But their use in either setting is exactly as it should be: highly effective but the noise you generate is the cost. Always drawing more attention from Virals, Volatiles, and the lumbering horde.  I won't go into much detail about The Following other than to say that the story was acceptable, but the 'cult' aspect wasn't nearly as creepy or deranged as I imagined it could be. Everything else about the expansion - the new area, new weapons, buggy traversal + combat - all added to the base game in a way that felt different but natural. Very enjoyable with plenty of content.  At a whole I enjoyed this game so much that it is now one of my favorites of all time. One playthrough took me about 38 hours. I loved it so much that I immediately started another. Now I'ved played the base game maybe 4 times and the expansion once, and I fully intend to revisit it once the memory has faded some. If this is a genre you enjoy, then I beg you to give this a try. Thank you for your time if you made it this far.",

Durability can be buffed with random pickups.  - Environment kills are fun and effective. Smarter to use environment when possible to prolong weapon life. - Bugs/glitches seem to be few and far between. They show up most often when climbing but were very infrequent.  - Vehicle in The Following DLC surprisingly durable, i.e. doesn't explode after hitting 2 trees and 5 zombies.  - Visuals are great, some of the scenery is outstanding. - Audio is well done although some of the music choices are questionable.  - Unlockable skills make you better at almost everything you'll be doing several thousand times (running, jumping, fighting). Grappling hook is useful and fun.   Cons:  - No way to become better at lockpicking. Picks never become more durable, sweet spot never gets bigger, lock difficulty never gets downgraded. I spent 2 hours trying to get some mods to work just to deal with all the ♥♥♥♥ing lockpicking. LOCKPICKING SIMULATOR 2015.

There's never an opportunity to make a choice, other than if/when you complete a quest. Some of these people talk a lot of ♥♥♥♥ and you never have the option to hit 'em.  - No signature or favorite weapons. I realize these people love putting durability on weapons, but there's only so many times I can break a crowbar on a rotting corpse's skull before my suspension of disbelief breaks down. There should have been some extra skills included that either drastically increase weapon lifespan or let you pick 2-4 weapons to 'favorite' and make permanent.  - No way to silence firearms. Ever. Even after you meet a guy whose vocation is gunsmithing, who you actually say 'GEE WIZ WISH YOU'D MAKE ME SOME SILENCERS' to. Lame.  - No creative use of the grappling hook. If you're familiar with Just Cause you'll understand my disappointment at not being able to stick the grapple in someone's ribs and hop over a streetlight to rip 'em in half. This disappointment was compounded in the DLC when it became clear I still couldn't tie zombies to my car and road haul 'em. Could've been an entirely new skill tree.

        {
            "review_text": "It may be squalid and zombie-infested, but Dying Light's city of Harran isn't a depressing wasteland – it's a vibrant, ambitious, open-world playground. Here, buildings are for climbing, the undead are there to be destroyed in creative ways, and there's always something interesting to be discovered nearby. It takes a while for that to become clear, though; at first, you might even think Dying Light is really about running scared from mobs of seemingly unconquerable zombies, who can quickly drain your stamina and wear out your improvised weapons. Don't be fooled. Yes, it's a struggle to survive in Dying Light's early hours. Combat is initially clumsy, with the diverse and deadly zombies able to soak up a disturbing amount of punishment before they die for good. Jumping – which is unintuitively mapped to shoulder buttons on consoles – can take a while to get used to. Getting mobbed is usually a death sentence. So is attracting the attention of the much more dangerous things that come out when daytime dynamically gives way to night, at which point the focus shifts to tense stealth — or, if you’re discovered, an adrenaline-pumping sprint for the nearest safe point.  Before long, though, you'll build up a skill set that turns your rotting foes into objects of fun, letting you vault across their shoulders, quickly slice them apart with dramatic slow-motion kills, or trick them into gathering around explosives before blasting them all into the sky. Even nighttime becomes an opportunity to raise skills faster thanks to increased XP gain, rather than a period of sheer terror. It all feels great, too; once you adjust to the controls, Dying Light's first-person parkour becomes natural and fluid, and weaving high-speed paths through its decaying slums and picturesque old-world buildings is so much fun that I almost don't hate the lack of a fast-travel option.  Combat, meanwhile, gets increasingly satisfying, although it never quite loses its awkwardness. Even when expertly shredding zombies with elementally charged tools of death I built myself, strikes are still heavy and clumsy. And while the guns you'll find later can pop heads from a distance, their low rate of fire and zombie-attracting noise makes them more of an occasional quick fix than a game-changing weapon. To Dying Light's credit, though, your adversaries are surprisingly capable; while the rank-and-file Biters are dumb and fun to manipulate, more powerful enemies – like the quick, agile Virals – are formidable close-quarters opponents, ducking your strikes and sidestepping out of your reach while looking for an opening to attack. Hostile bandits are even deadlier, able to dodge and block at close quarters, throw knives from a distance, and use guns and group tactics to kill you if you get overconfident.  That Dying Light's world is so entertaining is important, because it's unexpectedly huge. Finishing the campaign took me more than 34 hours, with a 68 percent completion rate. The story is serviceable enough, focusing on an undercover agent who becomes a savior to infected survivors and a thorn in the side of a maniacal warlord, but the most surprising thing about it might be its lack of surprises. Similar games have primed me to expect shocks and betrayals that will yank the metaphorical rug out from beneath me, and yet apart from a few big twists early on, Dying Light plays it mostly straight, with little nuance and few hidden agendas from its interesting (but underdeveloped) characters and entertainingly cliché villains. In a way it's almost refreshing, even if the end result is nothing special.  A big chunk of my time, though, was spent on detours into side quests, which are where the storytelling really shines. Taking on one of the many requests from random survivors might lead to something ordinary, like a fetch quest – but more often than not, they're multi-part adventures with their own short storylines, which frequently start out as seemingly run-of-the-mill tasks and escalate into something much more lurid and creepy. A search for a missing person, for example, might turn into a hunt for progressively more unsettling clues in a seemingly abandoned apartment building, and a routine rescue mission might turn out to be a trap set by a conniving madman. These are some of Dying Light's most memorable moments, and they make exploring its world even more rewarding.  While it's entirely playable as a single-player game, Dying Light is – like most things – better with friends along. Up to three co-op partners can jump in at any time to help you carve up undead hordes, watch your back while you're picking locks, or pursue campaign missions, and while the online matchmaking is still fairly hit-or-miss on PS4, online sessions are smooth and stable once they get going.  It's also useful to have friends around if your game is invaded through the 'Be the Zombie' mode, which lets a random player jump into your world as a super-powered monster with zipline tendrils and zombie-summoning spit. Playing as said monster is hugely enjoyable, especially after you’ve unlocked some of its grosser attacks, but it feels one-sided unless you're going up against at least two human players.  Other than moderately better visuals, the PC version's biggest leg up on its console counterparts is its customizable keyboard-and-mouse controls. Keeping track of the assorted key functions can be a little trying when things get frantic, but using the space bar to jump still feels more immediately natural than R1 or RB on PS4 or Xbox One. (Gamepads are, of course, supported.) Early on, there were reports that Dying Light would hang before dialogue or cutscenes, but these issues appear to have been patched, and the PC version now mostly runs smoothly for us, with only rare hitching while areas load. There is, however, an occasional issue with some textures popping in at low resolution and sticking that way. The PS4 version has a similar problem, but while it quickly corrects itself, textures that show up blurry on PC tend to stay that way.  Beginning as a furtive, desperate survival-horror experience, Dying Light gradually and gratifyingly evolves into a fast, hyper-violent celebration of vertical freedom and zombie destruction. Its main story is unspectacular, but the memorable side quests and sheer fun of exploring its world do a fantastic job of offsetting that, making Dying Light one of the most engrossing open-world games – zombie-infested or otherwise – I've played in a while",

The hard difficulty adds a greater sense of realism without being impossible. The story is pretty cliché, but it was endearing and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The soundtrack is amazing, enhancing the atmosphere to an even higher point.   The game has quite a bit of replay value, and has the qualities of many games. The zombie aspect of Dead Island (though done much better), the parkour of Assassin's Creed with the first person twist, and the open world factor of Far Cry.  The game does have its flaws however. You will likely need a decent rig to play the game above mid-settings (though the game is still beautiful this way). There are also several bugs, though none harmed my gaming experience.  Overall, I'd give it a 9.5/10.",

Then it spots me. This big ugly crazy zombie beast. I start running, but I can't see where I'm going. I run and jump and I hear the creature right behind me. I'm afraid to look back and keep going, completely disorientated. Then I try to climb on a rooftop when it bites me... I still manage to get on the rooftop and turn around. I'm surrounded... A pack of menacing zombies approach and climb on the rooftop. I swing at them with my electrical pipe and sparks fly all over the place. But I knew a was in real trouble... While panicking I tried to grab my UV flashlight, but they were too fast. I got bitten and thrown on the ground and bitten again and again. GAME OVER... After that I quit the game. I needed a breather. So yeah, this is totally NOT like Dead Island.",

Played Dead Island for a few hours, and it really didn't catch me but i love Mirrors Edge &amp; Assassins Creed. Dead Island and Mirrors Edge / Assassins Creed blended together is pretty awesome. This is the first FPS Zombie Parkour game i've seen, and it is well executed.   This game is - Even though it is a really good game, - kind of boring if you're playing alone, so go outside in the real world, get some friends and then convince them to start playing Dying light... So much for fun if you're 2-4 players.   The story is good (I LOVE JADE.... ... ... ... Who doesn't), and i wasn't really disappointed at any moment of the game. (SPOILER)   Only the fact that you can't play CO-OP in the last mission.     First time i played Dying Light was in January 2015, but i refunded it as soon as it was possible to refund a steam game. Afterwards i bought it in the steam summer sale 2016. And i'm not disappointed. REALLY WORTH those 24,99 euros. Also worth 50 euros if you got the money.   PROS: + Great Story + Fine Skill Tree + Smooth CO-OP + Killing zombies is hard and fun + Scary but not 'Outlast' scary   CONS: - Kind of boring if you're playing alone.  - Weapon breakes (Just my opinion)    Overall Score: 8/10  or ... wait a little...   10/10 :D!",

My problem is that it got boring pretty quickly. - I don't find the skill system that great. I prefer a skill system where you buy a skill and then keep doing that skill to get better at it, not to grind a lot and get a mastered skill. I feel no achievement through that. - Graphics are verrry nice. But I use a GTX 980 Strix with an OC'd AMD 8320. Sometimes, things like flying birds (debris?) in the distance make the frames drop down to 30-40. It was never really fixed, after all this time. But that doesn't affect gameplay, so meh. - I really love customizing characters and clothing when playing a game that has online features. I think that couldn't have been a problem to add given how the story didn't seem like the focus of this game.  It's still fun to play with others, though. Only because I love and am biased towards games with co-op.  I give it an overall score 7/10  Story: 5/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 8/10 Killing: 8/10 Needs more sexy half naked men: 10/10",

            "review_text": "Spider-man meets Mirror's Edge. Apperently you arrive in a poorly written story as a hired gun to do the dirty work for them. You dont even need to play this game for 10 min before you know something fishy is going on with the people he works for. The story is really boring and such a cliché.  What i disliked about the game:  - Noise attracts super zombies, regardless of where you are. Apparently they can hear a gun shot from EVERYWHERE!  - Water, blood, sun and all other annyoing effects blur your vision waaaaaaa(add more a's)aaaaay to much. Half the time you just wait for it to go away so you can see again. (Why make such an annyoing effect and then make so much content in a sewer?)  - The seizures, its so frustrating, not because you feel the agony, but because its just removing any way of playing when he's whimping about. We get it, he's turning, but come on, especially after he says 'this can't be happening now', for the 10th time.  - I think theres around 10 different types of zombies, pretty mundane towards the end.  - Way to much time spent in water, why would you do that when the swimming is terrible.  - The melee combat was cool at first, but after you behead a zombie for the 50th time, its not that interesting anymore (Also since its only the same type of zombies that you can behead).  - Weapons; Guns is just frustrating since it attracts super zombies without a question. Why is there no silencers? I see military equipment all over the place, but not 1 has a silencer. Reparing of weapons just leaves you to being carefull instead of careless (I cant use this badass weapon i just made as much as i wanted, because it will break eventually) which is really annyoing.  - Exploding zombies gets boring really quick, since its often just unavoidable.  - QTE bosses is the worst in a fps game, really, if i wanted to press A, S, D or W when you told me, i'd be playing a kids game instead.  - The annyoing Dead Island, FarCry and now Dying Light crafting system, it doesnt offer anything fun, that i have to craft my own baseball bat with nails in it, its a fun gimmick, but also completely irrelevant since most weapons you pick up is better or just not worth the hazzle. If you want to make the player get excited about crafting, make it more interesting or just leave it out.  - The sleeping (I can sleep whenever i want, why make such a fuss about it being night?)  - Weird AI (Ie. 3 dudes is guarding a npc, you kill off 2 of them without the 3rd one even seeing you, but you cant talk to the npc before the 3rd guard is dead)  - The map seems big at first, but its not, its actually kind of limited. Also very repetative surroundings, houses, zombies, safe houses etc.   What i like about the game:  - The fast paced running (Not untill later in the game though), which was really missed in the start of the game. I understand that the character evolves throughout the game, but one would thing that running is something every soldier is trained to do well.  - The slowmotion when you cut of limbs (Could have been way more variations)  - Weapon upgrades (Not the crafting part) is a cool gimmick, they could put a lot more work into it though.  - Side missions (Without it, the game would be very short)  - Co-op is always a huge plus.  - The hook.  - Parkour is always fun, but also a bit crazy at times, to see what he can hang onto as long as you hold space.   Summary:  You can predict anything that will happen in this game, since its so cliché. You know what kind of zombies there will be (Slow ones, exploding ones, runners, huge ones etc.), theres a villan (who almost wins duh), the plot twists, the awkward forced feelings about some random woman who you maybe have 5-8 cutscenes with and then he just falls head over heels for her (i mean come on, make some effort in the character building).  All in all, dont waste your money on this if you already tried games like Far Cry, dead island and assassins creed. It feels like a mix of a lot of games put into one. Also, the game starts out slow, which is understandable, but it also means that when you start to become more agile, strong and fast, the game slowly becomes boring and repetative, which is a shame. This is just my personal oppinion, you dont have to agree at all, but i was just dissapointed with it. Theres absolutely nothing new in this game and i wish the creators were a bit more creative, instead of trying to take good working things out of other games and fitting them into theirs only.",

My issue is with the 'Be The Zombie' PvP mode. Below are the issues that make playing as a Night Hunter not only terribly difficult but also no fun what so ever.  1: You can't see four feet in front of you. One would think that a zombie would have enhanced night vision; not in DL! Take the city at night and basicaly give it a photo negetive color scheme and thats your 'zombie-vision' if this is what they see no wonder they walk off ledges and trip down stairs.  2: Survivors have an infinite use, instant rercharge, infinite range UV flashlight. Not only can human players use this as many times and for as long as they want your energy drains instantly and the effective range is well over 600 yards roughly. Which turns this flashlight into a medium range F.U. add to that when your energy drains you can't jump, run, or use your tendril making you an easy kill with no way to escape.  3: Your attacks don't do sh!t. Human players get to keep all their over powered (and probably hacked) weapons plus items and gear and all you start with is a howl (which serves ONLY to give your position away) and a weak @ss claw attack that barely scratches a human. Before you say it, yes I am aware of the howl's ability to reveal humans but all you've succeded in doing is finding him but he knows where you are too so it's more of a liability than an advantage.  4: It's four against one. Ok how is this even REMOTELY fair? Not only do you have four human players to contend with but you also have to protect nests on top of that. Nests that are in horrible locations some of which make them un-defendable (any nests located in or under things). This is my biggest problem. We all know that even one human survivor with half a brain can easily hold their own with all the un-fair advantages I listed but add in even one other person and it becomes impossible. They will never split up they'll cover each other and you as the lone zombie won't have a snowball's chance.  Basically I wasted my money for a lack luster single-player and a pathetic excuse for a multiplayer that not only rips off Left 4 Dead (which actually gives the infected a small chance of winning) but also makes it no fun at all (unless your a human, you cheat, or both).

I have never been more disappointed in a purchase than I am with Dying Light. Other than the obvious PC from Console Port inventory system, the issues with performance on PC is just...terrible. Shame on the developer for releasing this in such a broken and unplayable state.  Just to be clear - this game ran great in the first little section of the tower. But right away things become very annoying very fast - such as the overblown film grain and chromatic abberation. The latter makes this game extremely blurry, distorted, and difficult to make out any details. Once you step outside the tower and into the game, you can expect your FPS to drop, and drop, and drop. Stare at the ground and you'll be fine, but if you want to actually play the game, be prepared to play in the 20 - 30 FPS range.  Also, it's 'additional effects' ie depth of field would have been nicely promoted had there had been a large disclaimer: WARNING - This game designed to be ran by NVidia powered GPUs only.   As for the gameplay - I honestly couldn't tell you. After a few minutes of attempting to fight zombies at extremely low FPS, exiting, adjusting effects, tweaks, and trying an external tweaking tool, I have finally given up on this title.

Looks better, combat is better, the parkour feels pretty good - not quite up there with Mirrors Edge, but very workable.   The story was very ordinary, evil government agencies trying to use a zombie virus as a weapon, protagonist agent going Dances with Wolves native with the survivors inside the quarantine zone. Etcetera etcetera et bloody cetera. I guess original storytelling isn't really something I should expect in videogames and so it was good enough.Anyway, the game works quite well, and is enjoyable to play. The night time super-zombies are sufficiently frightening until you get crazy good weaponry, the missions get a bit repetitive but I mostly enjoyed it.   That is until they threw away any appreciation I had with the finale. They threw away my good will with a giant finger raised to everyone that learned and enjoyed the mechanics with a piece of crap QTE bossfight.   Not only QTE, but a lying junk QTE which flashes up letters on the screen as if I know instinctively which finger is on D (they're just up down left and right to me!) and doesn't give you enough time to respond until you've failed and repeated it enough times to learn the sequence like a Simon Says game and ignores your input half the time anyway, extending the amount of retries.  So no, I don't recommend the game, if only because the payoff is an insult to gamers.

There's a healthy amount of fear in every combat situation. you know 2 zombies is a challenge, 4 is an issue and 8 is overwhelming. Then when night falls bravery is for fools. I never really felt the need to get to a safe place after the first hour of any dead island playthrough, The ones that come out at night in this are.no.joke. you will die.  Looks quite nice- when (and i stress when)you're not thermal throttling down to 17 fps, its quite decent looking. the enviroment is beautiful yet rough around the edges in a positive way.(at the time of this amd platforms are not playing super smooth but im sure it will be patched and i can crank back up to high visuals)  The Drop kicks- Yea. If you've played it. you get what i mean by this. the first time you drop kick a zombie off a building.... kool-aid man  Cons: free running system- After being delayed almost a year, the free running works, but it still feels sloppy at times. in such a hostile game,turns into a real big issue.  Level bars- yes the strength of the atmosphere is also a weakness. yes i think from a visual prespective of removing the arcade-like level bars that were in the dead island games does A-LOT for immersion, but as you play deeper into the game is causes great confusion. you go from weapons that do 20 damage to 200 damage and you can't in your heart of hearts always admit you can tell the difference. there's maybe 6-8 zombie templates you see most often. on the off chance you'll get two side by side. one takes one hit to the head and dies. the other one takes 14 hits and keeps getting up. there's no visual que as to why. and when youre making fast twitch descions like do i climb this or that? do i fight or run? it really makes you feel cheated when damage seems to be so randomized.   The Haystack Jump- the blue trash bags you jump into. yes it's a cool idea as far as fitting into the way the game plays with the free running. but they're a mess. i get it not locking into them like in assassin's creed makes it more threatening and dangerous but also it makes it hard to trust and/or use. sometimes you see two dumpsters.the blue bags dont appear from the certain angle you happen to be at so you have to guess (once again after some perfomance patches i exspect this will be mostly cleared up from a visual settings stand point) which almost always results in death. worse yet often, and yes 4 players in one game and it's happened to all of us many times, you land on the bags but they don't cushion your fall and you die. so yes atmospherically not locking you into a dive is cool. but the execution is so untrustable that you're better off not risking it  losing xp- when you die you lose survivor points.that sucks but once again it lends to the atmopshere of the game by making you actually fear death. unfortunately you're going to die alot from clunky game actions. i dare say equal or more often than playing flat out irresponible. for example in co-op we were spawned in a bad area of the game after dying.somehow it had shift a few hours to total darkness,we got murdered. respawned in safe zone across the map, but the night zombies were sitting at the door so we couldn't leave without dying. so we broke up the co-op game.spawned me in my single player game, at night, and you guessed it! surrounded by zombies. died. it's frustrating system when the game has the table on tilt. also why does it takes xp instead of currency? becuase the currency system is pretty much useless after $2000. all you need to buy is medkits.  no fast travel or vehicles-  sometimes you die at night just meters away from a mission objective and it sends you across the map.like...great....thanks....let's try that again in 15 minutes  gameplay in general- at first i was like wow! this game. but each hour has shown cracks and leaks and fractures. and to be honest the story is tacky. Your character volunteers for everything. the man can't say no! he's lifeless. there's a tower with the last 30 people left alive in it and they didn't notice a guy on the roof was selling drugs!!! the loot is unrewarding and shallow. and the combat just goes AWOL at times. you can't hit a zombie with a baseball bat but it has enough reach to smack you. it's repetitive. very. but worst of all the game just seems to turn on you at times. with everything i listed above all at once. even weirder the game plays fine untill you just hit a 20 minute skid where the game just goes from difficulty and skill to being flat out against you.   final answer:  All in all the art, world, and feel of this game is worth the ticket of admission. There's alot to like. but it's frustrating at times. not in a ninja guidan or megaman way. but in a flat out 'why can i suddenly not hit anything/ why does a 10 foot drop take all my health/ why does hitting the slide button stop me dead/ why does everything i normally do suddenly not work' kind of way, and the worst sin of all....it's a little boring. beautiful, dangerous, but boring. and its because of this i can't recommend this game. maybe with some a.i. tweaks and some patches that i know will be coming in the following weeks and months it will be much less frustrating. but i've went to bed unhappy two nights in a row now. this game was so close to great, really. there's alot of talent put into this game.

            "review_text": "Dying Light: a disappointment  After playing Dying Light for 13 hours, I have decided to set it aside. Normally, I am motivated to play a campaign from beginning to end. My main motivation now for this game is that I just paid $45 for it, and I should try to get some enjoyment out of it. But alas, I’m done. There are very few games where I just bailed out before the end. Recently, I stopped playing Alien: Isolation – but that was not because it was bad. I stopped playing Alien: Isolation because it was too good – too freakin’ scary. It was an excellent game that scared the bejesus out of me. But Dying Light is another story.  I had wanted to play this game since its release several months ago, but I waited (as I usually do) for it to go on sale – which happened this weekend. The game has amazing promise. A very large cityscape that I am free to explore… if you could call sprinting and scampering over rooftops, exploring – which it really isn’t. And you really need to keep up the speed when traveling through town, because zombies are ever-present. Still, the city and associated landscape are beautifully done. The parkours mechanic is nicely implemented, and I think it is the most enjoyable and satisfying part of the game. Nearly every wall and roof overhang is climbable. Works nearly flawlessly. I soon developed a high degree of confidence about navigating through the city by using this reliable parkours method.  There are two major problems with this game that rapidly drained my enthusiasm for it. I tried to “man-up” and try harder. But I finally threw in the towel. Dying Light was a surprising and sad disappointment for me.  Problem No. 1: Medkits. As I progressed deeper into the campaign and started leveling up, the necessity for medkits increased significantly. Ultimately, my main activity was reduced to searching for the materials needed to fabricate medkits, namely alcohol and gauze. The alcohol was fairly abundant, but the gauze was exceptionally rare. So, side missions and the main campaign had to be postponed, and the game became a grind of seeking out materials for making medkits. People who enjoy the “survivor” style of gameplay will love this game. I don’t. I love zombie games because I like killing zombies in the most brutal and deformative ways possible. But because of the shortage of medkit materials, there is a disincentive to go near zombies. This despite that in order to complete missions, there is no way to avoid zombies. Which leads me to problem no. 2.  Problem No. 2: Weapon repair limitations. The best way to collect good weapons is by killing the antagonist’s guards who you find on patrol in the city. Problem; these are dangerous encounters that suck medkits. Crazier problem, the weapons have a repair limit. This wouldn’t be so bad if the weapons lasted a decent amount of time, but they don’t. A seemingly durable object like a brick hammer has about 30 strikes in it before you need to repair it. Early in the game, a weapon can be repaired a maximum of three times. Afterwards, it cannot be repaired and becomes essentially useless. This leads to the next grind – constantly searching for new weapons to replace tired old weapons. This is especially a waste if the weapon had been modified (which consumes resources) or upgraded (which depletes the one-use upgrade resource).  Both of these “challenges” create an incentive to avoid the main campaign or any side missions because they could involve encounters with zombies which, in turn, will jeopardize miniscule medkit supplies, and which could damage the melee weapons that took so long to find and modify. In other words, it’s a zombie game in which you dare not try to kill zombies.  An internet search for “Dying Light medkits” reveals several links showing how players can harvest an unending supply of medkits and medkit materials by climbing a bridge tower and zip-lining across the gap to an isolated section of the bridge. Although this exploit can solve the problem with medkit shortages, such extraordinary measures shouldn’t be necessary. Besides, they cheapen the game experience.  The medkit fiasco and irreparable weapons policy, unfortunately, are the most “original” aspects to the game. Otherwise, Dying Light is a mashup of Mirror’s Edge (the parkours transits), Dead Island (the zombies and weapons), and Far Cry 3 and 4 (the comm towers; and the psychopathic antagonist) – which sounds like a winning combination. But it wasn’t for me. I don’t need the story to be original. I mean there are only about 30 stories that can be told. The key is the “telling” of the story. We crave that an original and imaginative style be used to communicate the essence of a story we all know so well – but in new and different ways. Ironically, In Dying Light, I have become conditioned not to care about the story because I’m afraid I’ll die due to lack of medkits, and I’m afraid that my precious weapons will soon become irreparable and useless. So, instead of campaigning as a fearless warrior, I have been reduced to a cautious curator. For me, what could have been an interesting, progressive and satisfying zombie-infested campaign sadly regressed into a beautiful and gigantic survival arena.  For the record, I am listing zombie games that I have thoroughly enjoyed: Left 4 Dead Left 4 Dead 2 The Walking Dead Dead Island Dead Island Riptide ",

Reasons being varied, but mainly concerning with the engagment of the story element.  The story is very cliche and shoehorned in. The AngryJoeShow review details what I've expirenced so far; characters that you will never care for and dialogue that is mere drivel, nor compelling. The antagonist, the villian to our hero, is nothing more than a local mob boss with little to no back story or interesting behavioral characteristics such as in other games like FarCry 3's Voss or FarCry 4's King Min. He's just a bland thug. The dialogue of the main character also is problematic as he seems far too melodramatic during a crisis and sometimes merely annoying in others. The player doesn't really have any envolvment with the fates of other characters they encounter, either to be met with an untimely death in a cutscene or killed off screen.  Besides that, it's just another zombie game from a fragmented team that thought they could bring a more 'mature story' from Dead Island. What colminated was an uninteresting set of characters that will soon be forgotten after their fates are met.  Gameplay, however, is satisfying. The athletic movement of the protagonists and plenty of skillset upgrades make for a enternaining romp through a zombie infested foreign city. The por kour system brings speed and a sense of power when in full motion. There are many types of weapons to acquire, either by purchasing them, crafting them, or finding rare ones in hidden areas of the city. They make for the most satisfying gorefest when confronted by the different enemy types.  The night and day cycles within the game give a refreshing expireince and difficulties as zombies and super zombies span the darkness of the night, while the day time is filled with the mundane zombie and many human theives, thus, and henchmen of the alleged villian.   The zombie enemies are varied as you progress in the game or wait until dark for the more powerful and faster super zombies. Though, incountering some of the so called 'boss' monsters can be accompanied with familiar troupes that long time gamers are so use to and easily overcome these obstacles. QTE events ruin some very important story line aspects, such as the final battle.  All in all, Dying Light has great game play that is mired by an uninteresting story and cast of characters. I do not currently recommned this games until it falls in price. This would be worthwhile at a cheaper pricepoint, but the unsatisfactory conclusion leaves little room for signle player replayability, where Co-op may give a bit more longevity.",

UI is terrible and confusing (since when is Start on the left ?!?)    Parkour works kind of okay most of the time, but when it doesn’t work? It’s HORRIBLE. I spent literally 3 medkit (which is way more than any zombie ever managed to do to me in this game) just trying to make the simplest jump. 3 medkit !!! Hell, I almost finished Super Meat Boy!     AI is nearly non-existent. Normal zombies don’t chase, and the other ones chase you forever, no matter what you do.    You are a soldier and yet, you get winded for SWINGING A PIPE 5 TIMES? ... yet running full blast for 10 minutes while climbing? Right, makes sense.    Terrible lip sync, no facial animation (so everyone is “scared” by being extremely bored and emotionless   In short, I’m beyond disappointed and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at this game.",

The developers made a big deal about this games survival 'scavange by day, survive the night'. Surviving the night was suppose to be a challange, yet after the first night mission I have yet to see how it is.  Firstly, the AI for these supposed night infected is absolutely terrible.. They are just as dumb as the brain dead zeds if not DUMBER! I can't believe more people aren't talking about this. Here are a couple things I have tried out to prove how dumb they are.  (All tested on Hardest Difficulty)  1. Run past a special infected insight for 3 seconds (No more than 15 metres away) - His spotting signal comes up, but he does not come after me. Shouldn't these infected that ONLY come out at night have incredibly good low light vision? It's as if they can't see that I am a human sprinting around. You can literally stand in front of them 10 metres away and watch the bar slowly fill.. bit by bit. This needs to be much faster or even INSTANT on the hardest difficulty.  2. This is the worst one, I sprinted right up behind one that is facing the opposite way and I began jumping up and down while following him at about 3 feet away from his back. After 20 seconds of this he did not manage to hear me nor sense that a human was right behind him acting like a bafoon.   Honestly knowing that they cannot see well, hear well or even smell me when I can touch them... Just ruins the whole Idea of night being dangerous.. It just Isn't. I can also run around, jump around and fall without a care in the world. This makes sneaking redundant.   They need to fix the AI ASAP! These special infected are just plain ♥♥♥♥. Until than, I must say this game is not worth buying. (Until this problem is addressed).",

        {
            "review_text": "This review contains spoilers. TL;DR version is at the bottom.  Dying Light is a first-person hack-and-slash / shooter zombie action game set in the fictional city of Harran (implied to be somewhere near or within the nation of Turkey) where you play as a humanitarian aid organization agent named Kyle Crane, tasked with air-dropping into the zombie-infested, quarantined city to find a rogue politician-turned-dictator who possesses a sensitive file that Crane's superiors order to recover.  What sets this game apart from the rest of the ever-growing cliché zombie game pile, and the feature that everyone recognizes Dying Light for, is the parkour system. Nearly every ledge, building, surface, wall etc. can be freely jumped onto / grabbed onto / climbed on to continue moving fluidly and without stopping. The main method of travelling the open world is running on foot, and the parkour system in general is surprisingly well-done. The freedom of movement allows the player to see things such as buildings, concrete walls, and abandoned vehicles as something more than what they actually are. Instead of a game like Skyrim or Grand Theft Auto V where these things would simply be obstacles, Dying Light instead trains the player to see them as assets to assist them in evading the zombie horde, creating a very extreme example of 'The Floor is Lava' game, except that the penalty for touching the floor in this game can actually be just as bad as touching actual lava in some situations. Ask anyone about Dying Light, and I guarantee you that the parkour is the highest point of the game the majority of the time.  But despite the game's strength that sets it apart from other zombie games, the problem that severely ruins the game as a whole is that it has no focus.  I'll explain.  The main problems with Dying Light come from several different sources: It tries to take itself way too seriously for what it is, it tries to incorporate way too many unnecessary elements, and yet at the same time, it's afraid to take creative risks and tries to play everything safely.  People can and will summarize Dying Light as 'parkour with zombies,' and that description by itself without context honestly sounds like something that's equal parts silly, entertaining, and hardcore, all mixed into one awesome package. Instead, the game tries to be 'epic' with an 'intense storyline' as advertised on the store page with what is possibly one of the most poorly-written, clichéd, melodramatic storylines I've seen in a video game this year. The vast majority of the voice-acting in the game is God-awful for a triple-A title, failing to convince the audience of the emotion that the scene tries to evoke whether it be panic, anger, or sorrow. This is especially apparent when the subtitles are turned on, where some words are written completely in capital letters while the voice is only marginally more stressed. There are even some parts where the protagonist Kyle Crane, whose voice-acting is actually bearable, ends up coming off as whiny and obnoxious when scenes clearly intended him to come off as dramatic and defiant.   In addition, none of the characters in the story do anything that make the audience care for them, even though the game clearly wants you to feel bad when the Young-and-Naive-Character gets infected by zombies or when the Fiery-Female-Character-With-an-Attitude sacrifices her life to prevent you from turning into a zombie. These are meant to be devastating moments in the game, emotional punches towards the protagonist whose character is supposed to be someone who deeply cares for people in need, but ten or twenty minutes later, instead of being traumatized, Crane's voice and demeanor goes completely back to normal like it was just a minor inconvenience, and even starts cracking jokes and sarcasm during one of the later segments in the game involving an extremely tall radio tower to prevent a military carpet-bombing. If this is supposed to be an emotional roller coaster, I must be in the little kids' area of the amusement park.  Speaking of which, let's talk about pacing. The nature of parkour, both in real life and in various media, is meant to be fast-paced. The definition of 'parkour' is to move along a route in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Thus, a game that features parkour as a main mechanic is expected to be relatively fast-paced, especially when the game is in a first-person perspective like Mirror's Edge. And yet, Dying Light just can't seem to make up its mind on the pacing of the gameplay with some of its design choices. Looting materials and weapons is near-instantaneous, and the control returns to the player very quickly after the action is performed, which compliments the fast nature of parkour.  But then, the game insists on including elements that completely break the flow of the game. The melee combat, especially in the early parts of the game, is excessively clumsy and doesn't blend with the parkour element, slowing the player to walking speed and turning the game into aiming blows to the head. Human enemies are the absolute worst offenders of this due to being able to randomly block melee attacks without warning, turning a game about running into a dodge-and-swing-randomly-fest in the early game when the player doesn't have access to ways around it other than 'wait for the enemy to swing first.'  Compare the combat in this game to the combat in Mirror's Edge and you can see that the difference is night and day. The combat and movement in Mirror's Edge are blended together almost seamlessly: One of the developers even states that 'When she [Faith] does hit, she hits quick, fast, hard, and then moves on.' I'm not saying Crane should flip enemies like Bruce Lee, but it's a much better alternative than getting locked into a Mexican standoff.  But the absolute biggest case of mechanics breaking the flow of the game is, believe it or not, containers. The vast majority of the loot is kept in containers, and every single time the player interacts with, Crane goes through an entire animation of bending down and clicking the latches and / or lifting the lid open. Even while underwater, Crane has to slowly lift the lid open despite holding his breath. Is that really necessary? Who actually cares about seeing hands reaching down and lifting a lid open? Did people demand that this was to be in the game? It only gets worse when the majority of these containers are locked, and thus the game forces you into a lockpicking 'minigame' that was blatantly taken from Skyrim, minus the perks that made it less of a pain. It is an absolute shame that a game that boasts parkour and freedom of movement forces you to bend down in a specific spot (the game actually shifts the player to a specific position relative to the interacted container) to fiddle with locks and slowly open a container like there wasn't a zombie apocalypse happening.  Combine all this with an avoidable day and night cycle, repetitive side-quests to fill the game. random collect-a-thons / easter eggs for funsies, and a bad crafting system, and it becomes painfully obvious that Techland wanted to incorporate as much content as possible for the sake of being a big-budget triple-A video game title. There was a significant amount of potential, but instead of focusing building upon that strength, Dying Light ends up trying to build a game from elements of other games that were successful without taking into consideration if these elements would fit in with the flow that the core mechanic provides. The part the stings the most about all of this is that Dying Light could have become something completely unique, fresh, and most importantly, fun, in a genre that's gone beyond stale. But instead of 'THE Zombie Parkour Game,' Dying Light ends up being 'Yet another zombie game, but hey, at least there's some parkour in here.'   TL;DR: 5/10. Painfully mediocre for a $60 game.",

There is actually one main difference between the two: level of seriousness. Dying Light takes a realistic-ish approach. Whole atmosphere is made to make it feel as real as possible: zombies are few compared to Dead Island, they are a bit more sluggish, but yet more bulky, you can feel their weight when hitting them. The colors are more grey, making the world look sterile and lonely, while Dead Island was bright, reminding you, that a few hours back it was brimming with life. You also get into zombie fighting here, when other are fighting it for a long time already. Dead Island showed the start of infection, lack of knowledge and skills. Dying Light, shows what becomes of such fight in a few months, when it becomes a routine. It reminds me of Metro and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games in this regard. But then there is a dissonance. Secret agent infiltrating an organization on the matter of (yet?) incomplete cure? Come on, they all need the cure, so any concerns regarding it should be discussed openly, no? And where in real world does a noob prove himself in an organization as if it's an old-school RPG? Overall, if you prefer a post-apocalyptic zombie game with a serious look and can ignore some minor issues with the story and story-telling - you may try this. If the above does not really appeal to you, skip. I am skipping it, because I'm just not in the mood for such seriousness at the moment.",

            "review_text": "Remember how Dead Island was a dumb frustrating pile a crap that occasionally broke out into a few minutes of fun? Imagine that, but just change nothing. It's a shame because the fun moments are really fun, but so many gameplay choices that were made are just bad. A few examples  - Playing solo and die during a mission after killing 2/4 guys? Meh, there's still only those 2 left, just keep throwing your corpse at the problem until it goes away.   - On that note, death really has no meaning in this game. I set the game to the hardest difficulty because I was hoping for some intense zombie action, but like with Bioshock, it doesn't matter how hard the enemy is, when you get infinite respawns with minimal penalties (only losing Surivor XP, which is incredibly easy to get back) nothing has any threat anymore.  - Playing 'Be the Zombie' for the first time? Enjoy fighting 4 people with auto shotguns! Not sure if this mode ever has more than one zombie player in the match, but if not I have no idea how one would deal with being perma-stunned by 4 shotguns/UV lights  - Zombies are attracted to sound, right? That's why when you shoot a gun, runners will start coming after you. So why is it that if there's an explosion way in the distance, the runners still come after me? Shouldn't they be heading to the big bang a mile away?  *Spoilers* I think the prime example of how the devs didn't things through was the fight against the first Demolisher. Now, I understand that this was supposed to be a tough fight. You've lost your gear, your identity is blown, your ♥♥♥♥ed, and now here's this big ♥♥♥ beast covered in armor that you need to kill. I loved it. Until I died. As usual, I lost an insignificant amount of exp, then respawn. Now here's the problem: the Demolisher's health was restored, which is fine, but the machete, the only weapon worth a damn I have available to me still hasn't had it's durability restored, which is not fine. I had to run around, grab one of the ♥♥♥♥♥ pipes laying around, quickly disassemble it and repair my machete. Playing on the hardest difficulty, it was pretty easy to get one hit by the bugger, and I get that it's my fault for choosing that, but I beat him with probably under 10 hits left on the machete and 0 repairs left, and had I not won then, I'd essentially be getting punished for trying too many times by being forced to use weapons that deal a fifth of the damage of the machete. I could write another paragraph about how dumb the escape sequence was after the pit, but I think my point is across.  All in all, I've had some fun with this game. I enjoy sneaking around shooting arrows at zombies, and if you can get the game cheap or find a friend willing to play it with you, go for it. Other than that, skip it. There are a thousand other shooters out there, and plenty of them are zombie games more worthwhile than Dyling Light.",

            "review_text": "Is Dying Light a good Zombie game? Yes. Is Dying Light the best zombie game out there? Definitely not.  What you need to understand is before there was Dying Light there was Dead Island, and then the publisher authorizes another studio to make the sequels, which should have been your first clue as to how the original game goes. Now Techland couldn't let such a good zombie IP go so easily, which is why there is Dying Light. Now to be fair, Dying Light is a much better game compare to the original Dead Island. The parkour system is a must for the kind of zombie game Techland is trying to achieve, the story is much better than the original Dead Island game (which isn't saying much because the story of the original is basically nonexistence). but on the other hand still isn't all that well written or paced compared to series like the Dead Rising series. The bad guys isn't as complex (i.e: flat) or memorable like Vaas from Far Cry 3. So in summary, had Dying Light comes out before those aformentioned games then it'll probably be okay, but since all those other game comes out Dying Light will inevitably get compared to those before it and in comparison, Dying Light's parkour system isn't as good as Mirror's Edge. It's story isn't as good as Dead Rising, and the Psycho villain isn't as interesting as Far Cry's villain.  Another thing I wanna complain about is the fact that boss encounter is annoyingly predictable. Every time the game strips you of all your inventory and you'll have to use whatever equipment the game throws at you. Which I find really annoying because if I grind for a powerful sword or something, I wanna get the option to dominate the boss I fight, even if it means the game become less challenging. And I want my game to restore my inentory after I'm done with that segment. In the final boss fight, you don't even get to use your equipment because the last fight was done completely in QTE.   TL;DR: Dying Light is a good game, but not a great zombie game. Don't get it for the full price but maybe for 50% or 75% off.",

Dying Light improves upon Dead Island in many ways - the characters are less cartoonish, the zombies more menacing, and the environments diverse and well-crafted.  Unfortunately, some pretty simple flaws in the UI and experience created major headaches. The game relied too much on QTEs and other animated events that broke the flow of gameplay. It required both players to be present in the same location to accept a quest - a silly decision. The final nail in the coffin was that both the beginning and the end of the game can't be played cooperatively. The end of a game should be a crescendo of all that led up to it - and this one fell flat.",

After I beat the campaign, I completed some side quests (%53 total completion, if I recall correctly). Apres cela, I just stopped playing Dying Light for it began failing to interest me further. I have also heard this game performs poorly on AMD systems; the developers have made a major improvement. I am running this in a Lenovo G505s Laptop (don't buy Lenovo technology) with its specs listed on my profile, and I get 16-28 FPS, with nearly a second of input lag. Recently, I reactivated my harddrve's page file, and that destroyed Dying Light's experience by causing multitudes of split-second freezing as the game places unneeded RAM-stored files to the harddrive. I need my page file because I only have 6 GB RAM (5.2 Usable) and 7 Days to Die absolutely needing vs. Dying Light not even needing it, but playing with it anyway, I don't mind not playing Dying Light for a while instead of, 'I want to play Dying Light. I'd better go change my setting and restart my computer and repeat this to play 7 Days to Die.' I also heard that this title is very akin to another title named Dead Island. I've never played that game, but just the thought of a copy / paste... Its logic to copy / paste notepad text, not a game. This game should be priced $30, because that is what it is worth... at least, in my own opinion of course.",

Human enemies are your bane...they can dodge/parry while doing other actions(swinging, throwing a dagger), they are immune to tackle/dropkick/slide kicking, and finally...they can ignore you hitting them and hit you back...which makes you stop all actions.  In hard difficulty they can kill you in 3-4 shots with melee or firearms...they take 10 hits(1900dmg weapon) to kill in melee(not including the ones they dodge and parry) and 8 shots with non headshots...oh btw...they shoot full auto rifles at you from a good distance away.   Biters are your next bane, why? Because they can take 5+ hits with the same 1900 damage weapon to kill...virals i can kill with 1-2 hits(they can kill you in 3-4 hits). Plus...there are a LOT of them.  When it comes to the main story, 4 parts are at BEST stupid and cliche. 1...you look around the whole area after clearing it, you talk some..you again look around...lights flicker on and off...you are surrounded by men pointing guns at you that come out of spots you literally just looked at.  2...You make it to someone...you trip balls, nobody touches you while you are tripping balls...it clears up and all your equipment is gone.  3..after 2..you have to fight someone that can take 20x more damge than you. In hard mode...i lost 24000exp and 48000legendary exp...because he is human(block, dodge and can do those while swinging/throwing dagger/taking damage) then to top that...once you get him down hp..four human enemies run in...enjoy.  4...you are finally going to kill Rais on a cool battle ground...only...its the only button mashing fight in the game...your weapons, you guessed it....have vanished. Oh...you die in one shot if you mess up in this fight with the one armed pansy.  The main badguy is: annoying, un-intimidating, and boring. He is your cliche, ♥♥♥♥ talking coward that you get cheated out of a satisfying way to kill him(see 4 above).  DO NOT get The Following, even if you have a season pass.  Volatiles that could barely catch up with you in the pre-dlc game....can now keep up with a speeding vehicle like its not even moving(it moves at 60-70kph).  They also added in a neat(sarcastic) feature...you cannot throw more than a few items(example is flares) before you have to wait a 'cooldown' period.  The new Volatiles can dish out insane damage, they have much greater health...oh...and you will NEVER run into only one in an area...seriously...i brought it down to normal to see what the map looks like with them...I started having flashbacks of Metal Gear when the enemy is on alert.  The new Legendary skill tree has a lot of cool things about it....only it is a grind fest...only...it is more of a P-Diddy grind blow out party on godly proportions. Grinding for those Legendary tree points is, by far, worse than any game I have ever played.   Until the human enemies are balanced out and the cliche main quest stupidity is fixed(it wont be) i will not recommend.",

            "review_text": "To start, I want to say that I like this game, but it is frustratinly average at times. I encourage you to read the entire review and decide for your self if you want to buy it or not.  Let me say that I ♥♥♥♥ing love the parkour. Thats the only thing I really liked in this game. The story is the stupidest thing I have ever played.   They kill off characters that you barely know.   I couldn't care less when they did that. The amount of cheesy lines in this game is beyond ridiculous. I wonder what the budget was like when writing this miserable excuse of a script like 12 dollars? Besides that, I love the parkour, environment, music and combat system. Dying light ACTUALLY makes you want to avoid the zombies from the beginning to the very end. It is a nice change of pace from those typical zombie games where you just slash through the zombies like paper. Speaking of the word zombie, this is the first time in a video game ever that refers to the zombies as zombies. About time, Let's talk in more detail about the game and its aspects so you understand why I am conflicted.   The Story and Sidequests:  The story starts off pretty good, jumping from a jet into a hellhole with a simple task of retrieving a document from a mysterious person. Without giving to much away from the actual storyline I want to talk about the quests themselves and the structure of the storyline. This is not a game you can complete in one sitting. The quests are as follows, Go to point A, across the map then return to point B across the map. It is so tedious to do this over and over again each time. The antagonist is poorly written and executed. This villian reminds me of Vaas from Farcry 3 except not as memorable. In fact not memorable at all. The side quests suffer the same fate, except there is no real reason that you want to complete it. I found myself not wanting to continue the story. It became so dull and so dry in the middle and at the end. It is like they just gave up with making it even remotely fun in the middle. There is one quest that was completely useless.    When you destroy the tower that houses the Volatiles, nothing really happened except Rahim died   . Most of the quests borrow from what I like to call the 'Farcry 3 school of climbing antenna towers'. It uses the ropes hanging from the edge of platforms to hint that you need to climb there to continue going up, just like it did in Farcry 3. This game is also riddled with fetch quests. IT IS SO BORING. I wanted to complete this game 100% but I just couldn't make myself suffer anymore through those tedious quests. I would rather drink a gallon of bleach. They tried to write a good story and at times it was really fun, but too much of it was complete and utter ♥♥♥♥. Luckily this game redeems itself with its combat and parkour systems.  3/10    Combat:  Combat is done perfectly, it is nice to actually be afraid of the zombies for once. I might be the only one but I got tired of playing zombie games that just allow the player to mow down zombies like they are a peice of paper. The zombies in Dying Light are tough and require multiple hits to kill. Early on in the game it is brutually difficult if you have no experience with this type of combat system but you adapt to it pretty quickly. There is weapon degradation which is a cool feature in my opinion. It is nice having weapons break and needing to repair them, but this game takes it a step further. In addition to needing to repair weapons there is only a certain amount of times you can repair a specific item. There are multiple types of zombies, 1. Regular zombie, slow and dumb easy to take down. 2. Virals, the fast mother ♥♥♥♥ers that are attracted to noise and can dodge your attacks and parkour as well. In numbers, these zombies are deadly but one or two are easy to take down. 3. Goons, these zombies have rebars and are very hard to take down in the very beginning of the game. They are introduced in the first 30 minutes of the game. They have rebars as previously explained and can kill other zombies which can be very useful. 4. Spitters, they spit goo that hurts you and is very annoying. 5. The demolishers or what I call the 'Tanks' which they are, they are tanks and are really annoying and strong. They are basically the rammers from Dead Island mixed with the Tank from Left 4 Dead. 6. Bombers, zombies that explode when shot, or near you. 7. Screamers, which let out a loud scream that not only hurts you but attracts multiple virals as well. 8. Volatiles, Oh my god these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are basically immortal. Yes, you CAN kill them, but early on in the game you might as well be attacking a wall. They only come out at night and are faster than you, so you cannot out run them unless you get lucky. I avoid them at all costs.  10/10    Parkour:  The parkour is done perfectly, very few mishapes during the game in the later portions but overall it is beautiful. This game is what Dead Island should have been. There is not a whole lot to say except it is well implemented and explained perfectly in the prologue.  10/10    Characters:  The characters are not memorable. You don't connect to them and do not have enough time to care about them   before the game decides to kill them  . Crane is the average protagonist. Male who has no credibility but is trusted with handling all of the Tower's needs. Oh don't forget that there is an awkward romance side between Jade and Crane. Although it is not directly addressed, it is hinted at multiple times. It would be nice to have a protagonist that does not want to stick his ♥♥♥♥ in the first female character you meet. As cliche as it is, I didn't expect anything new. Rais is horrible, a wannabe Vaas from Farcry 3 as I already stated but done horribly. Most games leave you hating the antagonist while this one makes me want him to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up for ten minutes. He talks consistently and is extremely annoying. While the characters are not horrible, they are just plainly average and there was so much potential to make them memorable and likeable. 5/10    Overall:  I recommend this game to anyone who likes the zombie genre. While I personally am burnt out of the genre I still played this game. I liked it for the most part, don't get me wrong. I just thought the story and characters were painfully average. While some of you will disagree with me which is totally fine, this is just how I felt about the game I still recommend people to buy it. So overall, i give this game a  7/10  Not the absolute best best I ever played but then again not the worst. This game had so much potential and it hurts me to see it fail in some aspects. Not a bad game and I encourage people to buy it if they have time to kill or absolutely love the zombie genre.",
