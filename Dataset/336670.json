    "description": "HIT is a free, multiplayer, deception-based shooter. Betray your friends and sniff out the Rogue Agent. Hit revolves around deception and espionage. Set in a sleek, 70s-style super-mansion and glazed with a decadent layer of treacherous whimsy, HIT is short, stylish, deceptive, and uproarious fun.",

            "review_text": "HIT is a good game. If you focus on the actual gameplay then it is a great game. If you go in expecting this game to be the best, most polished, most ambiguous game you have ever played then please leave this page and find another game. Also, if you're planning on playing this game solo or with only one other person then I suggest you find a few more friends to play it with and then come back. The whole setup for HIT doesn't really work with randoms but when you are with your friends, on LAN or talking over VOIP, it is really good.  The premise: 1 player is a rogue agent and the rest are operatives. The operatives' job is to launch a missile which requires fixing a generator, moving a statue to get its face scanned, pressing the right lever out of five (which operatives have information about) and then pressing a big button. The rogue agent's job is to stop that from happening. The rogue has the extra ability to recruit another player as a rogue too.  The 4 characters are quite simple in their mechanics but the dynamics when thrown together are very varied and certainly give HIT a major amount of replayability (I've played for 5.2 hours straight at this point).  The art design is pretty sweet, reminds me of Quantum Conundrum, and suits the game perfectly. The animations are good, character design is top-notch and the brief moments of voice work are a real surprise ('Medical license, shmedical license.') and the acapella mode makes me feel all warm and cuddly about the developers.   So let's get the bad out of the way, sadly what most of these 'reviews' are talking about: Controller-madness: The game shows controller buttons quite often which is annoying but nowhere near the hyperbole of some other reviews. Tricky Joining/Hosting: You have to make sure you only press ENTER once when loading in on the splash screen otherwise the server list doesn't load. Random. A little annoying. Not really a big deal (in a free game). I'm sure it's an easy fix. Options menu: This leaves a lot to be desired but there's not much you should need to fiddle with anyway.  That's all the negatives. Give the game a shot with some friends and I promise you the fun will counteract these issues by a long shot.  I really wish more people would play this. I really hope that the game is given the chance to grow. I'd love to see randomised objectives and another map or two. It's a shame that the game has been reviewed so negatively by those who've not given it the slightest chance and have zero room for error in a free game.  TLDR; Give HIT a chance with a group of friends. It's great fun.",

The parts of the game I know about are pretty good but, the bad part about this game is, that there is no one playing. I see potential in this game and, it seems really fun if you have friends to play with or, manage to find a server with enough people.",

It's better now, but it still needs to be improved.  It's fun after you've played a few games and gotten the hang of it. Adding customization for players beyond skin changes, new maps with different game modes and objectives, more characters, some improvements to video rendering; these changes would make the game great and build a community.  Right now, nobody plays it as the devs have stopped making updates for it. It's a shame to see a fun game with so much work put into it not be given at least a year of updates to realize its potential. Where's the commitment? Get to it, dev team.",

I load up the game for the first time and instantly the game is not my resolution, understandable though so I go to change it meanwhile also changine the settings to low which apparently had no effect on my games FPS and then I was unable to get onto the resoultions and was stuck on full screen and windowed so I pressed fullscreen and now it was my resolution even though it didn't have it listed on their. It's clunky as ♥♥♥♥ but I can deal with it, I press host game as find game doesn't work and it asks me to input my name so I do and press enter...Nothing, I try spamming enter...Nothing and then randomly it works and asks me the same question again so I do, now keep in mind this is a 'PC' game not a console to PC game so you will understand my confusion when all the controls are Xbox controls leaving me clueless as to what to do, the controls are self explanatory for a gamer however so I got into the game. The game looks fantastic but for some reason when moving the FPS dies completely for me however if you have a very good computer this won't be a problem I wouldn't think. I try to quit so I press escape...Nothing, so I spam it and accidentaly hit windows help which takes me out of the game and upon returning to the game I now am running the game at 640 x 400 for whatever reason so it was at this point that I decided to alt f4 and leave the game.  The game seems to have a great idea but honestly should be an early access game due to clunky menus, graphics options which appear to do nothing, resoultion that does whatever it wants and obviously the servers are broken. Although if you want to look at some gorgeous graphics just go into host game and admire the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.",
