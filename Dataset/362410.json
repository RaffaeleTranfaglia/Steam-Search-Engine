            "review_text": "A fairly decent series of games to spend an afternoon on.   I bought these games a while ago and just today decided to give them a go. To my surprise, the original series of games has been taken off of the store page and placed back on as one complete game, “Adam’s Venture Chronicles”. Which Steam has kindly given me a copy of as well.   Seeing as I can’t review the separate episodes anymore, I’ll review them as a whole here. So despite my 5 minute playtime for Chronicles as of right now, I have played them! I will surely be saving Chronicles for if I ever want to revisit the trilogy. Which, isn’t entirely impossible.  With a total of 7.7 hours put into completing them separately, These games are fun and definitely the kind of game I was craving today, but I’m not going to hype it up too much.   The very first thing I noticed about these games was that you don’t control the camera. The camera pans and follows you. I got used to it very quickly and was actually surprised with how well it worked. But it made the games feel all the more linear. The game is linear as it is, but not even being able to look around kind of supresses the sense of exploration even more. I don’t particular find it a problem, I just thought it was worth mentioning.  As for the graphics in general, given how long ago the first episode came out (2009), I would say it looks pretty decent. It definitely has its moments.   The Puzzles are probably one of the most interesting parts to these games, they are interesting and fun to figure out, without being too mind bogglingly difficult. It’s always nice to see some new unfamiliar kinds of puzzles.  The characters are okay but nothing special. Admittedly the main character Adam did have me smiling a few times. The cocky, full of himself, almost arrogant, yet somehow still charming, character reminded me of the Deponia series’ “Rufus” in quite a few ways.   Despite me thinking the characters themselves were alright, the voice acting generally isn’t the best quality. A few scenes made me cringe a little, but then again others I quite enjoyed. Just something to be wary of.  In terms of story it’s definitely playable and has its interesting parts. It doesn’t bore you to death but it’s definitely nothing too in-depth or profound. As far as I can tell it’s based around Christianity. I know very little about religious kinds of things so maybe for someone who follows the faith, this actually might be more interesting/clever? Either way, I still enjoyed it.   In terms of achievements, this would definitely be an easy 100%. Fortunately for me, playing them all separately, I managed to get 3 perfect games out of it. Each episode’s achievements were pretty straight forward to get. The majority are progression achievements, although there are some in there you can easily miss, so watch out.   All in all, this game is nothing amazing but it’s definitely worth playing. Anyone that likes adventure/puzzle games might get something out of this. It has a Tomb Raider kind of feel to it, with less emphasis on the platforming elements.    TL;DR : Decent third-person adventure/puzzle game, it’s fun, challenging and can be completed 100% in under 8 hours. Despite it looking fairly old it definitely holds up. I’d say it’s worth a go. ",

            "review_text": "It's rare you find a game series that honors God and has decent graphics to boot! Lots of puzzles that require logic, mathematics, and deductive reasoning. Hard to find because many companies feel that gratuitous violence, filth, and sexual innuendo is the only way to make a buck.   What is even better? The company will soon be releasing another installment called Adam Venture: Origins- YAY!",

There are a lot of mazes, problems and puzzles that you need to solve throughout the game to let the story come to an end, some of them are quite tricky and seem to have little logic and some are pretty straight forward. Mostly trial and error but they are fun and its a good game that i would play more of if the series was/is continued. Enjoyed the game",
