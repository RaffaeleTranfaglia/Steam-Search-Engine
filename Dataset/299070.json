The graphics may be lacking compared to today's standards, but I can assure that Warrior Kings: Battles has everything that an awesome RTS has to offer.  You can build a massive invading force, or simply toy around with your enemies. Great game!!! would pay well over $10 for it again.",

            "review_text": "I travelled back in time and played Warrior Kings: Battles for a couple of hours to realize again that this game is still one of the best RTS games on the market. I first played it more than ten years ago and it amazed me. Nothing changed. I tried a tons of simple RTS games during the past years, like Dawn of War, Warcraft 3, Kohan 2, Supreme Commander, Mark of Chaos or King Arthur for example and my final conclusion is, graphics means nothing in case of a great RTS game. WK:B still gives a deeper, much more enjoyable gameplay than most of today's copy/paste RTS games.  You get a city building game mixed with Total War-like battles, pure strategy, pure tactics in one game. Rushing is not an option here. Every unit is different and every one of them has it's counterparts. You should play your tactics well to achieve something in this game and you should plan your strategy carefully on what you spend your income. Build a sawmill for the peasants for more material or upgrade your heavy infantry's armor? Choose wisely!  Those minor aspects of the game, like visibly training your units, the support cart for your armies, the scouts and the spies really brought something refreshing into the genre back when the game was released. It was original.  The visible puff of the horses, the rallying of the ravens and crows during a battle to have feast on the dead bodies, the pagan demon from the wickerman, the imperial archangel from the stone statue, the praying monk knights, the renaissance musketeers totally hooked me into this game... again after more than ten years.  It's a classic! I recommend it to anyone no matter if you are not into the RTS genre. I still keep my original retail edition on my bookshelf together with the poster-sized tech and faction tree what I got shipped together with the CD and the manual.",
