    "description": "Grand Theft Auto is back. The cars are faster. The streets are busier. The bad guys are nastier. The police are angrier. And now, the FBI and the Army are getting involved... Seven ruthless gangs are involved in a ruthless power struggle and it is up to you to make a name for yourself. Respect is earned, not given.",

            "review_text": "The first GTA game with the so loved GTA feeling. The whole game is played from a top-down perspective with 3D objects. You can do missions for rivaling gangs (Zaibatsu, Loonies, Yakutza,...). An important part is dealing with the respect level of these organisations. You can only do missions for gangs with positiv respect level. But technically you can finish the game without doing missions, because you get points for everything you do in a way. Additionally you have to juggle your saves. You need to pay 50.000 $ per save (especially at the beginning this is the money of 2-3 missions). Wonderful game with outdated graphics, but starting point of one of the best franchises.  btw, my playtime of GTA2 is after GTA:SA the highest.",
