            "review_text": "One repetitive bit of background music. No zooming in our out. Buttons located on top and bottom of screen where it's impossible to use them without causing the screen to scroll. Unpredictable pathing so sometimes enemies walk twice as far through a map as they need to. Unsatisfying to upgrade since usually another cheap tower would be more cost-effective, except that you run out of places to put new towers. Windowed mode doesn't seem to work. Occasional crashes.  Island Defense very much wants to be Kingdom Rush, but it's a very poor man's Kingdom Rush. I've got some hours in, but I'm a hopeless tower defense nut always looking for things I haven't already played. You can probably do better.",

            "review_text": "For Achievement Hunters: Achievements are broken for 4 out of the 16.  For everyone else: The game has no ending, no story, 4 out of the 6 towers are useless beyond level 1. Heroes are mostly useful for only their power ups and die a little too quickly when fighting. Doesn't require that much strategy once you realize the majority of upgrades are useless and you spam towers. Not really worth the time to play.  Art in the game is pretty good and was the inital reason I tried it out. The Venus Fly Trap known as Island Defense got me good.",

            "review_text": "I think that is a decent tower defence game. Reason why I got is because of two key features   1) I am a fan of tower defence I mean who isnt? 2) This game weapons and enemies are not OP which is awesome  I bought this game for one reason mainly because Steam Policy says you need to buy '$5' min to enable to send a friend request. I think that they should change.   May container spoilers in my opinion     This game has heros you get to only choose one at a time to battle along side with you in the tower defence. There are three in all. I think that this feature is awesome in my opinion note: The vehicles in the game are so hard until I relised that you need to have the lightning tower that owns them    This is a good game ",
