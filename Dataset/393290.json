Pros:  Great controls (Keep in mind I used an Xbox Controller) Runs perfectly fine on my crap laptop DANK MIDI MUSIC  Cons: Simpler gameplay (just Gas, reverse, handbrake) Not much content Music skipped once   Its a fun racer, with very good controls. if you're in need of a racing game, that genre that is strangely sparse on Steam, Its worth a try. Just flat out racing if you're in need of it.  AND DANK MIDIs",
