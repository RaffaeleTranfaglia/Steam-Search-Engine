Relic Hunters Zero is entertaining as an arcade style of game. It's simplistic gameplay, loads of collectibles and agreeable challenge factor give it major bonus points.  I find that some of the weapons are difficult to use, especially my go-to in shooters, the sniper rifle. I find that it's range is not at all what it could be, which is disappointing for anyone that wants to take enemies out from afar.  Also, the game's overall story is built on very little backstory, as if you are tossed into a fight that you have no idea is going on. This takes away from the interest, as I'm left questioning what is going on at all times.  That being said, what this game lacks in story is made up for in its charming and fun style of gameplay. This 2D shooter lets you roam through a variety of areas with a loadout of your choice, and you can either take out your enemies quietly or blow them to smithereens, taking the terrain with you.  Final verdict, Relic Hunters Zero is a good game all and all, because its fun and it has a bit of charm to it. The collection feature is a great way to boost playtime. It may lack in a few areas, but it makes up for them well enough that it doesn't matter. I can destroy my enemies and the whole world as I please! Mwahahaha!  Final Mark: 3/5 stars",

            "review_text": "I've only been playing for a week before I posted this review. I gotta say, I would've expected stuff like DLC or something to make us pay one way or another. That's how free games go on about nowadays.  However, these developers have returned the feeling of tingly warm sensation of generosity! For a game this good, it feels like it should be worth ten dollars or so. Instead of slapping a price tag, they just hand it to us, showing phenomenal artwork with pixel graphics so good, it brings back the old days. Music fits in well, and everything feels alive.  Focusing on game play, it really dives in the arcade feel. -It has 6 characters, all having unique stats and some having different game play. How they shoot, punch, use their grenades, or even what weapons they start off with. The variety of your tactics mixing with these characters make a lot of difference, but fun nonetheless. -Each of them has the following standard. -Health determines how much hits you can take before you get K.O.'d -Shield acts as a barrier for your health, and can recharge if you're safe from attacks long enough. -Grenades are throwable bombs for most characters. Some may use it differently however, like Pinkyy uses it for an invincible barrier for a short time. -Ammo, ranging from Light, Medium, and Heavy, it refills your guns clip depending on what kind of gun you have.  The game features two modes.  -Adventure Mode would be considered as 'Story Mode', or 'Campaign'. It holds 4 stages, each having 3 acts to complete the stage, then followed up by a boss known as Duke Duncan. The Adventure Mode is short, but is meant to be replayed as it offers 'Relics' that can be obtained through these levels or by buying them. (Not real money of course) Shoot or bust your way through these levels with planned out maneuvers or fast tactics. Watch your surrounding whether it's a crowd full of enemies, a cage full of dangerous beasts, an explosive box, or breakable barriers. The environment is there, and how you go about is up to you.  -Endless Mode is more or less like Adventure Mode. The only difference? It's mixing in with dungeon curses! The disadvantage occurs during the stage, sabotaging you or supporting the enemy. Now with even more troubles to worry about, you'll have to watch your ammo, health, shield, and your surroundings! Along the lines, there are even more relics to unlock and an exclusive weapon upgrade! Try the game and feel the difference!  -Rating- Price Range: More than Generous! Game play: Fast, Smooth, Tactical, and lots of Arcade fun without the use of quarters! Overall: 10/10 - No risk in trying something that's free!",

There is no money you can or have to spend on this game. +Despite being completely free, it plays very well and has tight controls (on KBAM, never tried a controller, prefer KBAM for most games like this anyway, just my preference) +Super charming and realised art style, very pleasant to look at +Sound design is minimalistic, but again, charming and satisfying +Game feedback (screen shakes and hit sounds and such) is satisfying +It's open-source if you're into that! Aspiring game devs and experienced alike can poke around in the source code freely +Plenty of replayability added through a persistant unlock system (new characters, weapons I haven't unlocked yet, etc)  -No online co-op (doesnt kill it for me, but apparently a selling point for others) -I can see how some would see it as short or repetitive, but I won't complain for the low, low price of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FREE -SOME, not all, may not like the game's aesthetic... that's about it...  how yall gonna complain about a completely free game, made for YOU, THE GAMERS",

Only slight complaint I have is that the melee character seems to be a little underpowered. Well, she definetly has enough POWER, but she feels a little squishy. I realize with the melee it's high rish high reward, but I find when playing with her, most situations call for gun combat as going in and trying to melee would result in my death or taking a lot of shots. I know she shouldn't/isn't a tank (since there is a character dedicated to that) but I think she should have a sheild that can take more than 3 or 4 hits from most enemies. Despite that, she's still playable and not broken in any sense. 10/10 great little gem",

Relics are fun and gives a hand in some cases. 4. Co-op is fun 5. Endless mode is a good thing to play.  Only draw backs for me is:  1. sometimes it gets hard (Like stupid hard) but depends how you take it. 2. No online for those that want to play online 3. There is a story some what but its not all chat chat or cutscene really. It has Lore but the game is not heavy on it. 4. You probably wont take the game serious when you find out you fight ducks.
