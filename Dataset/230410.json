            "review_text": "Before you read into this review, let me ask you one question. Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe.   Warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture.  Warframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free.  Warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please. The Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol, a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in.  And then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee. We've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine.  Melee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3.   So yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative.   That said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.",

            "review_text": "BIG EDITS: This is long, and it is only getting longer with the edits I've been making. I repeat myself constantly because many only read the things they don't like and then comment about things I have addressed. This review is for new and old players. I say I can't recommend it, but there are many positives about the game. If you are dedicated to trying it out, you will need to invest a good amount of time to get to a competitive point. This is not a game you can just pick up. It is hard for beginners.   Let me preface this by saying I love this game, and I will always hope it gets back to being all about the players. In its current state, I cannot recommend it.  I've played this game since Beta release. I am a Grand Master founder, and have put a ton of time into it. Many of my friends and clan mates are still active, and I usually play with them for social reasons at night.  DE has beat this game into the ground. It used to be great. It was always grindy, but it was a delight to play through all the content. Throughout Warframe's lifespan, DE has had a ton of over the top dreams and incredible ideas. When Archwing was announced, everyone was super excited......then it was released. It was half-♥♥♥♥♥ and has not been fixed since.   Nerfs. Any veteran player (and even some newer players) could talk about nerfs all day. DE Scott loves his nerfs. He has lost sight of what used to make this game unbelievably fun.   DE Steve and DE Scott don't take the devstreams seriously, and constantly shoot down fixes and brilliant ideas from players.  I honestly don't think most of these guys play their own game. If Scott actually took a character off godmode for one damned minute and tried some endgame with his nerfs, the game would immediately get fixed. What these guys need to do is set aside one solid week a month and just play their game. They don't get a whole lot done, anyway. This would at least give them some insight into what needs to be fixed. DE has some serious ADD issues when it comes to fixes. They bounce around so much that nothing actually gets done.   GRIND/FARM: These guys talk constantly about reducing grind, but then the next update comes out and there are grind walls and wait/pay gates EVERYWHERE. I understand completely that this is a free to play game. There are right ways a wrong ways to go about it, though, and they've chosen the absolute worst way to do it. EDIT: The grind has been seriously reduced. Not only that, but it's a lot less monotonous and miserable to do so. The recent big changes in the void system have only really made it necessary to grind for Relics (void keys). Not only that, but the void is now a 'planet', and the traces are run on regular missions. Now you can do what my friends and I call 'killing four birds with one stone'. Grind farming is still a thing, but being able to farm four things at once is a HUGE step forward.  GRINDWALL/PAYGATES: By grindwall/paygate I'm talking about complete stoppage of progress due to a wait gate, which can be paid to reduce. This is what the foundry is. 12 hours for weapons, 12 hours for some materials for weapons, 12 hours for pieces of warframes, 72 hours for frames . . . . That means it's at the VERY least 84 hours to finish a warframe in the foundry without buying it. Some weapons need anywhere from five to ten pieces that take 12 hours to build. They are farmable in a way, but its random. Nitain Extract is needed for just about everything nowadays, and waiting for random alerts is ridiculous. It is NOT purchasable either. I get on the game after the family goes to sleep and I'll maybe get one a night. When some pieces need ten to build, and one frame in particular takes something like 15-20. This is bad game design.   It kills me to say that I would not recommend it. I love this game, but I hate where it is, and where it is going.  EDIT: If you can stand endless farming and grinding, then I would say go for it. Still not changing this from not recommended, though, as grinding and farming are two huge turnoffs to many players. I can only handle it because I used to spend a LOT more time doing so, and this is nothing like it used to be.  The art is spectacular. The graphics are amazing. The combat could use a bit of work, but it is fluid and is remarkably fun......for a little while. The grind walls for gear are downright criminal, though. If you plan of having fun, just get the frames you want and don't even worry about mastery rank. This type of grinding kills the fun of the game.  EDIT: See earlier. Void relics have seriously reduced the grindwall for gear. Highly suggest farming for relics with friends, so drop chances are that much better.  I'm sorry DE. I've continued to defend you guys for years. I've spent a lot of time and money on your game, but you're bleeding it dry. You're bleeding your players dry. You are killing the game that was once so beloved by your playerbase. Until you guys start caring about your game again, you will continue to lose the people that so strongly supported you for so long. EDIT: Many of the recent changes show that DE may have the players in mind in some aspects. I continue to play because of the amount of time invested into the game, and due to the fact that my friends still play. I will keep an eye out for player focused changes and let you guys know as soon as I know.  EDIT: Do not misunderstand me when I say I cannot recommend it. I am heavily invested into this game, and I can't bring myself to completely give it up. I still enjoy playing with friends. Many of them are still active players, and I mainly play to be social. The game is very fluid, but it gets old quick. If you're in the market for a FTP game, then give it a shot, but the grindwalls will eat at you constantly. They have done a few things to combat this, and they need to make their money somehow, but for every grindwall they reduce, they add two more.  If you have friends that play, go for it. If you are going to be playing with randoms, I wouldn't suggest it. The community is fairly toxic.",

            "review_text": "Caution: Overly detailed, so I am very sorry   So I've been playing this game for about 3 years now, and this has easily become one of my most played games that I own. Not even exclusive to steam. Warframe is a game that takes place in space, where you take control of a 'Tenno', which is the faction/race of everyone else that plays. What is a Tenno? Well... play for yourself, and you'll find out with time. -wink-  'What is a Warframe?'  Warframes are the battle-suits that you control. You walk as them, you fight as them, you hang out as them...you pretty much ARE the Warframe. (Yes, I told you that you are a Tenno as well. Like I said, it's just a suit. It's complicated.) There are currently 29 different Warframes to collect/build and use, each with their own unique set of flashy abilities. I say 'currently' because the development team behind this game are constantly working on it and sending out updates (also, one of the most enjoyable development teams I've ever seen, tbh), and the community helps shape the game greatly.   Anyhow, the Warframes are battle-suits for a reason. In this game, you are a freaking ninja, in probably the most ninja way possible. From wall jumps, slides, air-kicks, backflips, gliding, rolling, super jumps, throwing stars, dual daggers, etc.. You name it, it's probably possible. There is so much movement and control, you can fly through areas like a breeze if you get the hang of the movement system. There is also so much customization in this game. Assault rifles, rocket launchers, bows, crossbows, sniper rifles, shotguns, laser-beams, sawblade launchers, wormhole creators, grenade launchers, laser cannons, lightning shooters, gas cloud launchers, laser-rifles, infested growth that shoots bullets and grappling hooks, freeze-rays, and much more. Also, most of what I just listed are primary weapons, meaning you ALSO have secondary weapons, which are your sidearms, and melee weapons. There are an equal amount of interesting categories for sidearms, but if you are an in-your-face type of player, then enjoy your collection of melee weapons, including single swords, dual swords, katanas, daggers, glaives, bo staffs, polearms, hammers, axes, whips, whip/blade combos, energy-blades--well, you get the point by now. There are many skins for your weapons and your warframes as well. Another thing that heavily affects customization is the fact that you can color anything that you own, from warframes, weapons, companions (little robotic fellows that float behind you with their own supportive abilities..or, you know, a cat or a dog.), armor pieces and scarfs (this game is called Fashionframe by the community for a reason), and even your own ship.  Your ship serves as your personal hub, where you can access the star chart for missions, your arsenal, your foundry (for building weapons, warframes, gear, and everything else), your mods, and more. What are mods? Mods are these little cards that drop from enemies in the game, some mods being specific to certain enemies. They also have tiers of rarity. Anyway, mods are a very important feature, and are used for upgrading your warframes and weapons. There are hundreds of different mods, ranging from additional health percentages, additional damage, elemental damage (which you can mix different elements to form new elements, might I add), ability range, and just...pretty much anything you need to help you progress and spice up the gameplay a bit more. Want a silenced loadout for stealth? There are mods for that. Screw stealth, you want explosions? Mods.  'Who are the bad guys?'  There are a handful of different factions in the game, mostly all of them against the Tenno.  There are the Grineer, who are crude, ugly, bulky clones of other Grineer, made to produce a massive army. Usually found in their battleships, or their own settlements, destroying the planet's landscape with machinery. They look dumb, but can be pretty tough.  Another faction is the Corpus, who are driven by greed. They are more technologically advanced than the Grineer, using robotics, drones, and lasers in their favor.   The Infested is another faction. They are...a bit of a mess. Disgusting heaps and masses of flesh, screeching as they charge to attack. They are basically zombified, destroyed forms of Grineer and Corpus, but you really don't see them that way, considering how mutilated they become. They don't have much of a role other than to spread the virus, and, most importantly, kill you.  There are a couple of other factions, but they are a bit spoiler-y, so I'll avoid talking about them.  'Why are we doing any of this in the first place?'  Because Space-mom tells you to, and you must listen to Space-mom.   '....who tf is space-mom?'  Upon the Tenno's awakening, you are contacted by a mysterious woman by the name of Lotus, who first appears to be an AI of sorts, although taking a humanoid form. You have no memory of anything before this 'awakening', so you should probably listen to her.  She guides and cares for the entire Tenno faction, alerting them of dangers and important events happening throughout the solar system. She is your leader.  'So what is the main objective, overall?' +bonus info i dont know where to fit otherwise  Really, it's anything you want. A lot of players get lost because they don't know what they should be doing, but you are just supposed to make your own personal missions, which you can invite friends to. Also, this is a very heavy co-op based game, so have as much fun as you want with up to 4 players in a squad (or up to 8 in raid missions). You can play this game completely solo if you want, of course. It will be pretty challenging, though.  So let's start from a new players point-of-view. You have unlocked your first planet. You can continue to do the mission-nodes that it has to offer, all the way up to the planet boss. Each planet also has a newly-added feature, which are known as Junctions. Junctions are what players have to go through to get to the next planet, and will offer a variety of trials before passage. Upon completing a Junction, you are rewarded with a few things, such as blueprints for weapons, a few parts for building a few specific warframes, and they will unlock quests. Quests are side-things that you can do, which also give you some rewards. There are a handful of warframes that are quest-exclusive if you want to obtain them, as well as some helpful items to assist you along the way. Another recent addition (as in since December) are Cinematic Quests. These are main story-related quests that have cutscenes, and usually have a lot to reveal about the lore, and will unlock some other nice things (You still have to unlock these quests from Junctions, or even just through the market.) The in-game market shows mostly all of everything you can get in the game. The best part? You can get most of this for free! Of course you can add money to just BUY weapons, warframes, gear, companions, etc., and gain access to them immediately, but this is not a pay-to-win game. Not at all. It's more of a 'pay-to-progress-faster' game. However, building these things by yourself without paying any real currency can be a fun time-consuming process. The word Fun can be taken literally or sarcastically in this subject, depending on what the building requirements are, for what you are making. You gather resources to build and complete these things from different planets throughout the solar system, each having their own set of different resources. They drop from enemies, loot lockers, and storage containers (there is even a warframe that increases loot drops, while simutaneously punching souls and raising the dead!). Also, you can earn the real-money currency in this game by trading with other players. I'm out of space at this point, but all I have to say is I wish more of my friends could get into this.",

            "review_text": "I guess it was fun while it lasted. It's hard for me to write this after so long.  To begin with, the game has great community and still has a lot of potential if many core issues are fixed.  We started playing Warframe with my friends when it was not on Steam yet, like almost 4 years ago. None of them play it anymore just because of glaring issues that you begin to see after some time.  Developers are focusing mostly on new content no matter what. Game design issues that were in the game from the beginning are simply ignored or a band-aid fix is released which doesn't adress the issue itself. Broken enemy armor and health scaling, useless weapons and Warframes aka mastery fodder, energy management is non existant, most warframe abilities either useless and nobody ever uses them or OP due to superb CC capability or straight invulnerability etc. and at some point get nerfed without buffing other abilities to compensate and so on.  Every once in a while devs introduce a new system just to forget it for next year or two. Two-three weeks after it's been released and almost nobody uses it, and there's a plenty of such cases (Archwing, Dark Sectors, Conclave, Kubrows, Syndicates, Maroo's Bazaar, Focus... seems like similar destiny awaits recently introduced Lunaro)  Grind, oh god, grind increases exponentially with each new update. I feel really bad for newer players. Devs tell they want to change the situation where old-time players have tons of resources and nothing to spend them on. And how they fix it - they release a weapon with crafting requirement of 30000 for a not so common resource called Cryotic. To explain, you can get like 100 Cryotic in 2-3 minutes maximum if you're good at only type of missions where you can get it - excavation. There you have to defend excavator for 2 min which can be simply one-shot by high level enemy (there's enemy damage scaling issues too, yup). Not to say the weapon itself is again a useless one. After community uproar passed and people seemingly forgot about this issue, devs release new Primed Warframe with requirements for similar kind of resource (Oxium) of 14000 (by similar I mean the way to obtain it - you have to play specific missions to get it and amount is like 10 per specific enemy at best, and there are not too many of those enemies). After another community uproar it was changed to 7000, which is still a huge amount for many people, and more so for newer players.  Also Void, a place where Primed ('glorified') versions of Warframes and weapons drop. There were already many Prime Warframes released, and some of them have already been 'vaulted' (taken out of drop tables). The official reason for that is there isn't too much space in Void mission for many Primed Warframes and weapons, and not to create dilution in drop tables some Primes were vaulted. But from dev-team's actions you can guess the real reason is different. There are several mission types in the Void that have little to no Prime part rewards and devs keep adding useless resources to the drop tables where they simply were not present several updates ago, thus intentionally diluting Void mission rewards.  Also devs tend to put most desirable Primed parts into most boring and long (20 min) missions in the Void. And the chance for this part is like 5% or so, and guess what? It's 5% for one of 5 different parts, making it 1% (if you're lucky) for the exact part you want. I guess it's okay that people don't want to waste 2000 minutes of their time to have a chance to get the part they need. Not to go too much into details, I'd say Void missions are not the only missions that have this problem.  Recently there was an update addressing most of OP Warframe abilities, and that seems to be causing another community uproar now, as broken enemy mechanics are not fixed and most of the time those OP abilities were used to work around those broken enemy mechanics. I'm not sure how high level missions (Sorties) or raids (aka Trials) will look like after this update as in some cases there will be no counteraction to nearly instakill damage any more, especially when you barely scratch the enemy's health (lvl 100+ enemies). Endgame here is like it's either you relying on those OP abilities to keep you alive or you get one-two shot the moment you fail to do so.  TL;DR - Devs produce more and more content (and bugs and broken mechanics too) and seems like they forget of even 2-3 month old content - Ever incresing grind, with latest updates - exponentially - Warframe abilities nerfs without fixing core enemy problems that were causing players to rely on these 'OP' abilities - Many initial game design flaws that most likely never will be adressed",

Now the Negatives...   -The game is an infinite power creep.  -The forums, I have never met such a nasty group of people in my life.  -The game doesn't have too much grinding, the game IS grinding, you are grinding to grind more.  -The game is ridiculously easy, you can get almost every item in the game in just about a month.  -The paywalls, unless you only want to have two Warframes, you gotta pay up, that or attempt the horrible trading system.  -The generic enemies of clones and spacemen, most of the concepts are quite unoriginal. The enemy designs seem to be based on freaking shapes, or just generic space zombies straight out of something like Halo or Dead Space.  -The AI barely makes enemies a threat, they will suicide rush you solo, all while getting slaughtered.  -The bugs, this is a beta game but good god, it's been out for 2 years, they simply neglect to fix them. Hell, sometimes they create more bugs than they fix. These things are so rampant, it actually makes a SERIOUS impact on the games sometimes, from camera issues to getting stuck in walls, bugs ruin SO much of the gameplay that it hurts sometimes.  -The balancing, DE couldn't balance a seesaw, some items are worthless, others OP to the extreme. The developers have proved time and time again to be completely incompetent when it comes to the issue of imbalance with weapons and frames, they will leave the top teir weapons that completely outclass anything that comes near them alone, while nerfing random items that very clearly didn't need it. It makes no sense, the whole update process is an endless stream of nerfing and ignoring. They also just straight up ignore useless frames and items, theres nothing more to say, they just ignore them.  -The updates, most just introduce a shiny version of something already in game, or a useless gun.  -The end goal, if you don't care about a number next to your name, there is none  -The asskissing, DE will release a patch to fix something THEY broke, and people thank the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, yeah sure, that makes sense, not to mention ANY critisism of ANY of their decisions, (no matter how stupid they are) will be shot down by their White Knights  -The gameplay, stealth is a neglected factor entirely, the whole game is just trying to get ahead of your squad to try and do more damage, any other gamemode is just killing ♥♥♥♥ with some minor objective to focus on while you spam your skills or choice of over-powered weapon.  -The devs greed, they will ignore major problems so that they can release a new Prime package and find more ways to suck your money out, (Like slots, for example)  -The idiotic community, just go look at the wiki, every page's comments has someone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a weapon and telling you some other one is better, they just bicker endlessly about everything.  -The matchmaking, there isn't any, you have to go sit in a chat room, (Unless you join a clan, WHICH YOU SHOULD BE!) and wait for some Rhino Prime to join your game, unless you're doing normal missions, cause then you are ♥♥♥♥ out of luck cause unless some random person is doing the same node at the same time, you're doomed to play it solo.  -The money creep of cosmetics, every new item that comes out is more expensive than the last, you know why DE does this? Cause they know their brain-dead community will eat it the ♥♥♥♥ up, and throw tons of money at the screen while mashing 'THANKS DE' into their keyboard as hard as they can.  -The lack of progress with updates, sure they come often, but seriously, they give us random weapons that who's gonna care about when there is elite top level gear that cannot be out-classed. The updates never bring ANYTHING new or significant.  -The lack of variety in gamemodes, there's like 4 or 5 gamemodes and you better like them cause they are gonna be the only thing you play, ever.  -The PvP, this should have never been added, the Conclave is straight up dead, being horribly unbalanced and incredibly laggy, (I'll get to the reason behind that next.) and Dark Sectors are controlled by clans that use DDoS and other shady tactics to force massive taxes down players throats.  -The lack of servers, every game is hosted by a player, which means lag, a LOT of lag, it sometimes makes the game literally unplayable, and it's incredibly common.  -The crashing, I crash 2-3 times a day on Warframe, just... my god, if I had to list the amount of times I had to Alt-F4 out of the game, this review would be three times as long.  -The movement, you simply latch on to walls when you wall run, nothing feels natural, every jump, every vault, they all feel stilted and slow. Not to mention sometimes you just FLY mach 5 across the map when you jump from a sliding position, the jumps are so irregular.  -The melee combat, you run up to the enemy mash the E key and you MIGHT hit them, it's completely random. And just like other weapons, melee weapons are completely unbalanced, for the most part heavy weapons are useless, and certain weapons destroy the rest hands down, its borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  -The Argon issue, every new weapon requires Argon crystals as an artificial way to make them harder to obtain, this simply comes from DEs issue of being uncreative with ways to acquire new weaponry.  -The fact that certain frames are one trick ponies, certain frames are only used for one (sometimes two) abilities, while the rest of their entire arsenal is completely ignored.  -The lack of a challenge, this somewhat correspondes with the game being too easy, with a certain frame and weapon, anything can be completed by a braindead child, people actually have to make up their own end-game of getting to high waves simply to have the RISK of being defeated.  -The lack of a skill requirement, as I said directly above, so long as you have the right weapon and frame, you can conqeur literally anything. There is no reward for being good at the game, in fact you don't even have to try your best, simply having the numbers 1-2-3-4 on your keyboard is enough to be just as good as anyone else.  -The most ignorant developers I've ever seen, here is an example, there is a weapon called the Dark Dagger, it is awful, as every single handed dagger is. However, the hilarity insues when you realise, that the tiny Dark Dagger, is around the same speed as the giant two handed hammer Fragor. And you think that's bad? NONE of the dagger stances actually match the Dark Daggers stance polarity, NONE. That is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard in my life to be honest.  If you want to play with other people, join a clan, most of the community is elitism ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who don't care about the gameplay, and are simply waiting for the next prime to come out.  The more people who dislike this only proves what I'm talking about with the asskissing, every one of these points is true, no matter how much people will try to deny them.   Fanboys will be ignored and most likely have their rant deleted, think before you post.",

            "review_text": "Warframe. I spent 1000 hours on that game. Never played a game so much in my life. And guess what. I had fun in it. Plenty. The actual gameplay isn't even bad.  But the game is flawed.  1) Welcome to grindland.  It's basicaly a huuuuge grind. Everything can be either bought with money or grinded, but buying in-game items with real cash is out of the question because of the ridiculously high 'platinum' prices.  But hey, who wants to pay to get stuff anyway right? Go out there and farm that orokin golden bling bling gear, mighty space ninja!  As much as I like the fact this is a TRUE free to play, I just can't stand game where the sole sense of achievement you get from playing it is about your possessions. In fact, the entire rank of your account is based on how many different weapons you own. Doesn't that give you a slight hint on how much of a grinding simulator this is?  2) 'Balance? what is that lawlzors'  I started playing at update 8. That was almost 3 years ago.   At times, some weapons were already better than others, but not by that much (eg. Boltor). You could run any set of gear and still enjoy all the different playstyles they provide. but as the game progressed over the years, it was crippled by some MAJOR powercreeping. To this day, those weapons I played with at update 8 are completely useless. Some of them had slight buffs, but are still absolute trash (see Lanka for instance). Basicaly all the 'top gear' that all those high level players use are either a new weapon that's blatantly overpowered (Just think of the Soma when it came out) or a prime variant of it, which is basicaly a better, shinier version of a gun, that sometimes is already too strong, because the devs have zero knowledge in how to balance the game (Soma prime?! What a good idea!).  What this means is that to run harder missions, the best choice of gear will always be that one new weapon that's just stronger than the rest, not that cool polearm you loved so much, simply because it's being outclassed by that one new melee weapon that just came out, or whatever else is considered the best weapon at times. This restricts a ton of different playstyles from being anything near viable. Want to play a Sniper zephyr with glaive with the Vectis's unique playstyle? Well sorry, but the glaive is old, thus underpowered, and a new sniper just came out which is better than the vectis by a long shot. Yeah, I had that happen to me.  It's just a race to aquire the strongest weapons, which are then replaced when a new patch brings out something better. Meanwhile older but sometimes more fun gear are left in the closet accumulating dust due to their innefectiveness. Playstyle diversity is a joke is this game. Even the many different classes have only one, 2 rarely, viable build for the late game.   -=Conclusion=-  The reason why I can't recommend this game is probably because I grew up, and started to dislike games centered about grinding and possessions. Yeah, Warframe's gameplay is good, but you'll never jump into a mission telling yourself 'I'm here to have a nice game' , but instead thinking 'I'm here to get X item'. Some of my friends enjoy these types of game, so if that's your thing, go ahead and jump in. But to anyone reading this who doesn't feel like grinding the life out of yourself while using the same broken gear in every mission, feel free to pass.      ",

            "review_text": "Lets start by saying, I absolutely adored(d) this game.  Like many other MMORPGs, the game had a serious grind issue. But it was fun, atleast for me. I loved farming parts to build my new weapon, enjoyed playing Sorties, which are hard missions within the game for rewards, It was fun for me to just 'play' the game, without any objective at all, just for the sheer enjoyment of trying to survive an hour in the toughest void defence with a friend, while you're being overwhelmed by enemies and only your abilities are keeping you alive. Basically, this game was my favourite game for about a half a year. So why would I give it a negative review, you may ask. One simple reason. The support and cheat detection system of the game, and their reluctance to help me after I was banned.   One day, I just logged into my account, nothing special, and noticed I had a duplicate of a maxed mod I didn't have before. I thought to my self, why did I do that? So I decided I wanted to trade that mod for platinum, a premium currency ingame. As I secured a deal, I got presented with a trade-limit, as it told me I have used up my maxed trades for today, when I didn't even trade a single time? We tried at different trading stations, until I tried to join the trading station on Earth, called Maroo's Bazaar. It sent me a message I was trade banned? I decided to go onto the support page, and requested a trade unban, and explained all of what I just said above. A few hours later, I got a reply that I was permanently banned from the game for 'selling my account in trade chat' which as I knew was breaking the EULA. I tried to log in into the game, but I was banned for 19 years? I guess. I wanted to go onto the forums to ask for help, but I got banned from the forums. I decided that the only place I could come back to is the support forums, where I wasn't banned yet. I submitted another ticket, telling them about I was inoccent and I was willing to assist them in anything, if it was to get my account unbanned. I marked the the ticket as 'suspended or banned'. I later realised that someone probably got into my account, being the reason as to why I had that duplicate maxed mod. I updated my ticket with my suspicion, and changed my password. The next day, I was greeted with a beautiful message in my email: I have been banned from the game because I was 'selling platinum, the premium currency for real-life money in trade chat', or something along those lines. Remember what message I was sent earlier? I was selling my account in chat, two different things. And to top it off, they told me that they detected no suspicious activity on my account, and banned me off their helpful support page. I wasn't even mad, just suprised and sad that even if a player loves their game, they don't care for people who didn't support their game in Beta. If you're looking for a timesink, don't risk it. I was the unlucky one, don't you be another.",

The objectives vary enough, but the main flaw of the title Digital Extremes is out soon given the limited variety of levels.

            "review_text": "Long story short, this used to be an amazing game. It still probably is. But it is in a pretty severe decline. The devs have shown a complete lack of awareness about the state of their own game and an unwillingness to listen to dedicated players. Instead, they have begun trying to balance the game around mid-game content (T3/T4-ish) more more accurately around the skewed conceptions of casual players. The recent nerfs to many top tier frames are a perfect example of this. Casual players and players in mid-game content thought that Excalibur was overpowered, so the devs smacked him hard with the nerf bat, but the truth of the matter is that Excalibur wasn't even capable of doing most of the high-tier content in the game (sorties/raids). He's now completely useless at end-game and middling at best in mid-game. Simulatenously, they have gutted many of the frames that experienced players DO rely on, making high-level content difficult or generally just tedious. The nerfs to Trinity and Valkyr have made it so that the only way to do a Sortie 3 Survival with a bad modifier is just to camp in a corner with a Frost/Vauban, which leads to undynamic, stale, boring gameplay. They reworked Mag because they felt she wasn't played enough and all it did was completely gut her kit to a degree that she is now useless in end-game, while giving the illusion of greater complexity in the mid-game.  In a PvE game, the correct way to effect game balance is to buff weaker characters/weapons/etc. to bring them up to the level of the stronger options in order to create a large diversity of EFFECTIVE playstyles. Warframe's approach has instead been to brutally nerf all of the stronger options (except the ACTUALLY ridiculous things, because it's not like Ash needs some work or anything... &gt;_&gt;), removing diversity from end-game play, making everything feel far more tedious, making you feel generally underpowered (when the devs have explicitly stated that in Warframe 'you should feel overpowered' because that's what warframes are in lore), and basically forcing high-tier content to be cheese in stupid, boring ways. Since I don't look forwards to endless camping of a corner just to get through Sortie 3's, I'm not going to be playing this game much anymore, unless the devs pull a 180. Which is a shame since I have over a thousand hours and hundreds of dollars sunk into it (by my own volition, because I believed in supporting the devs for their work).  Long story short, the devs are unwilling to address tediousness/grind in a frequently tedious/grindy game, and their attempts to do so have only exacerbated the problem by leading to LESS dynamic gameplay being the only viable option at high levels. Give this one a pass unless the devs pull their collective heads out.",

Playing this game from it's earlier beginnings to seeing what it is now has made me not bitter, but disappointed. It has good things about it that I probably did not cover, so if you want check it out in game. This review is only for the current state Warframe is in. I'm sure it will get better, but this is just my thoughts on it. Until I get a better computer I'm stuck with this.  PROS: -Visuals and feel are great. The graphics are pretty ok for a game in development since 2012 and 2013, definitely taking the spot as a next-gen game at the time. -Interesting and unique frame designs as well as weapons. They know how to develop very amazing and interesting characters with own unique abilities and weapons, changing how you play on the field (somewhat slightly but eh, it's fun to mess around). -Very, very fast combat. The feel of slicing and dicing your way through enemies is great. -Great community. There is very few toxic players that I've seen in this game. Most people are just happy go lucky lads.   CONS: -Grind, grind, grind. Like I said up there, the whole game is a grind. Grind for materials, for new items and item leveling and customization new content.  -Repetitive gameplay. Tilesets, missions, item leveling, the whole game is just boring to play after a while. Related to unending grinds. -Buy, buy, buy. Most accessories are bought with platinum, so prepare to make some kid cry because you 'scammed' him or buy your mothers card and go on a spree. Most recent update(s) made some stuff you didn't have to buy made so you are forced to buy them to continue. Such as getting items from the foundry, you can either wait day(s) to get a new item or spend your plat to speed it up. It feels more like a mobile game now. -Horrid hosting and matchmaking systems. No dedicated servers or anything of the sort, so your latency is pretty much up to the person leading the mission. Only hope that you're the one hosting and the others suffer or pray to God the host isn't playing in some underground cave where they're only provider is Mediacom. -The lore. For the most part things make some sense but more recent stuff just kind of fits where ever. I'm sure the devs just add on as they go. -Bugs. From the loading screen to the liset to even the missions everything is buggy. The recent updates made the game just even for buggy. If you thought grinding for items was annoying, just wait till the host loses connection or bugs your rewards out. Say goodbye to the multiple hours you wasted for nothing.  Don't even get me started on the nerfs. Don't waste your starter plat on items from the market, only use it on slots. You'll thank me for that.  This game is very well on terms of looks and combat, it's a unique take on the stealth and fps games we see today. is essentially a grinding game. I have so many hours into this game because I found it addicting at first, but slowly I came to realize this is nothing but a mindless grinding money-grabbing game, also my computer is ♥♥♥♥. This game started out as what I'd like to call a 'failed abortion'. No publishers nor investor wanted to partake in their activities when they started out, but quickly they landed as one of the best 'next-gen' video games of 2013 and were climbing the hill of success, only to see them slide and roll their way down the other side. As of now, it feels like the developers do not take their game as to heart, perhaps it's because a Chinese chicken company bought them. This chicken company had '70% of its gross profits came from Digital Extremes in December 31, 2015', as vg247 said. This decreased their profits and most likely lowered their morales to continue developing their game.  Sometimes it's hard to forget this game is free-to-play, as you advance in the game you realize to get more slots and items for your arsenal you need to spend platinum, an in-game currency that is basically everywhere. The only ways to get platinum is by selling your more valuable items or buy purchasing it with IRL currency. The unending grind. Instead of doing something with the many resources DE has in their game to make the grind less, they instead add more and more types of resources into the game making them harder to collect, forcing you to grind repetitive missions and go through the tilesets over and over. With that DE makes it so that newer items cost more resources to build, making you grind harder than previously. Examples of these resources are tellurium which are (rarely) found in archwing missions and nitain extract (an alert only resource that you literally have to wait to get). Of course you can easily get these 'buy' purchasing them from the market and guess what, that costs plat as well. In recent updates they've changed many things, making you buy even more things with platinum forcing you to choose whether you want to give up your items you need or don't need or spend cash to get them. I would talk about this games horrid hosting and matchmaking system and the god awful PvP system that barely anyone uses/enjoys and many other things, but since this is getting extremely long I'll cut it here.",

The grind and the abundance of features that are added, have some bugs fixed once, then ignored forever are the two biggest problems I have.  The grind isn't horrible when you start the game, or at least, it didn't feel that way to me, but once you start trying to reach mid/end-game, there's so much you have to do to be even remotely powerful. First things first, barring even getting your weapon/frame of choice in the first place (which is a grind for materials, then a wait for it to actually craft in real time), you have to get damage/health boosting mods that are basically required to not have your gun be a peashooter or your warframe have no health. Then if your weapon/frame needs some expensive mods to be good, you have to forma (reset the level of) it, usually multiple times over, before you can afford to have all the mods you want. All of this takes way too long to do in my opinion. However, even if you like or can bear the grind, there's still one more big problem that keeps me from wanting to play. DE added a gamemode a while back called Archwing, where you'd get a cool little space jetpack flight device thingy you can use. The gamemode, like many other features DE has added over the course of time, is not much different now than it was when it was first released. Basically, no one plays any archwing missions, because there's no reason to besides to level up the archwings and archwing weapons. This happens to basically all but a few missions as well. There's no reason to play them other than to proceed through the starchart to unlock more planets. There's like, 6 missions that are good, and they're all there to level up stuff that you've already forma'd half a dozen times. DE wants to fix the mission problem, but there's all these other features they added too that no one uses because they're either broken, boring, useless, or some combination of the three. The game is fun, and I know DE wants it to be good. Right now though, I think it's in a place where it's just not worth playing.",

            "review_text": "Saying this game is Free to Play is a bold lie. Let me tell you the story of when I started this game. You are only allowed to pick 1 of 3 starting classes, or warframes, out of the existing 10 or 15. So you play around and you want to make a weapon. You can either 1. use ingame points to unlock a blueprint for the weapon, if the weapon you want even has a blueprint, farm the resources to make the weapon which can take a really, really long time, especially for a starting player, after obtaining everything, spend even more ingame credits to START the making of the weapon which takes 24 hours (not joking), wait an entire day, and THEN you get to play with the weapon. Or 2. give Warframe your money. Making warframes is even worse. You have to fight the same boss over and over just hoping you get the right drops from it. You need a Chassis blueprint, systems blueprint, helmet blueprint, and a warframe blueprint. You need to build ALL those items before you can even begin making the warframe, which all use ingame credits AND TAKES 3 DAYS TO MAKE. Or you can throw your money at Warframe. Oh, and you can only have 2 warframes out of the 15 to play with. You only have 2 warframe slots and like 5 weapon slots. You want more weapons or warframes? Looks like you have to spend some MORE MONEY. You need to give Warframe more money so you can get more slots just to get more warframes and weapons.  Let's talk gameplay. The gameplay is 'fun'. Sort of. I enjoyed playing solo missions more than playing with 3 other strangers . Why? Because if I play solo, I can try using stealth, which is impossible if your new 'teammates' fly down the halls shooting everything in sight. Also, if I play solo, I can play at my own pace. Every single game that you play online with 4 people, the game becomes less of a fps and more of a race. Actually, that's a perfect description of what happens. It becomes less of 'There's 2 guys over there, I'll sneak up on one and shoot the other in the head' and more of 'RUN RUN RUN OH LOOK AN ENEMY OH HES DEAD RUN FASTER FASTER'. It turns into a clusterf**k of color....  I'll summarize all of this. So basically, this is micro-transaction the game. The only way to enjoy the game to it's full extend is spending a lot of money. And I mean a lot.  I would actually prefer it if you had to buy the game. That way, Warframe wouldn't be a lie, and you wouldn't have to deal with half the bullcrap in the game. Sadly, even IF they did that, you would have to deal with the OTHER half of the bullcrap, like waiting 3 days to play with a warframe. It's just a stupid system, and is just used to siphon more money from your wallet. Oh I forgot to mention, you can spend real money to speed up the process ._. so yea, more ways of spending money... great...  The game is 'fun' ish, if you can look passed all the crap, which I cannot. If you ignore the facts that you need to spend money to use more than 2 warframes, spend money to use more than 5 weapons, wait 3 days to use a new warframe, wait 24 hours to use a new weapon, how the game puts micro transaction after micro transaction in front of your face every single time you open the game (oh, if you stop playing for a day, the next time you open the game, you win a 'random reward', which is ALWAYS a discount on your NEXT MICRO TRANSACTION), then you might like this game.

            "review_text": "Are you a fan of Dark Souls? Are you a fan of Monster Hunter? Then I would HIGHLY recommend giving Warframe a shot. This game is the best of both worlds, bringing difficulty and fun gear collection to the forefront of free-to-play games  without requiring any money to be spent , contrary to popular belief!   // First Glance //  After delving into the deeper aspects of what this game has to offer I am without a doubt mesmerized by its beauty and presentation. The overall design and scale of this game has been a welcoming experience -- as I am tired of most games lately, the same cut and paste formula used from one game unto another. Yes, Warframe is based loosely upon the sci-fi genre but the way Digital Extremes has gone about creating this particular universe and breaking the mold of every other sci-fi game has been much appreciated on my end. The  strange  and  unusual  that pushes others away from this game has drawn me closer and given me the desire to learn more about its unique direction.   // Key Aspects //  This game has a lot to offer. I will admit that I was one of the original beta testers that walked away after closed beta. The fact that the game only had two different ”tile sets” and lacked content was an immediate turn off. But now after returning many months after my last login I find the game has grown substantially, thanks to the community-developer relationship, which in respect has gained a lot of traction due to the various features that keep veterans from the community and development team going. What this game has to offer is, simply boundless, once you've peered through the veil.  280+ procedurally generated missions, which include: • Standard Missions • Alert Missions (randomly generated location and reward) • Infestation Missions (guaranteed reward) • Invasion Missions (guaranteed reward x3) • Challenging Boss Fights • Void Missions (private instances, earned via key drops) • Orokin Derelict Missions • Nightmare Mode  Then we have character progression: • Limitless ways to customize your warframe via mods • Limitless ways to customize your weapons via mods • Clans and Clan Hall building • Clan Research for clan specific gear/materials  And with each patch there is a special event that takes place, something big and eventful that ties into the lore and awards players with unique gear that can no longer be collected after the event has ended. Talk about gratifying.   // Pitfalls //  The only drawback I see this game having is with people and their lack of patience. (If you've made it this far into my review then by all means get to downloading!) It should be mentioned that most crafted items need to take 12-72 hours (in real time). Also, using revives is limited. You can only carry a set amount of revives and when you’re out, you’re out; until you gain another one (one per 24 hours). On the flipside, ALL gear and warframes can be attained through gameplay and the only things platinum (real money) need to be used for is additional weapon slots, warframe slots and aesthetic items. Earning platinum through the game is easy as well, selling rare mods to other users is an easy way to attain this currency in order to make the small purchases you need to maintain your collection of warframes and weapons. Therefore,  real money from your wallet is  not  required .  ** To help alleviate confusion while playing keep this  Warframe wiki  [warframe.wikia.com]  close by.   // Understanding //  From the moment my friends log out, I find it interesting how the community in this game thrives. Aside from the “Recruiting” chat channel (to enter hidden zones with a pre-formed party) there is little to no communication between users. It’s as if there is an unspoken language between those who have survived the tutorial and beginner missions. Experienced players in most missions have zero communication and there is a strong sense of synergy, as if role-playing our speechless Tenno comes with the experience and territory.   // Conclusion //  I feel most people overlook this game by the sheer fact that their first experience was miserable and they didn’t take the time to give this game an honest chance. From the surface it’s overly complicated and doesn’t hold your hand. But for those who carry on, that is the draw… that is the appeal. Set your own goals and the game will become very rewarding. What are you waiting for?  Masterful Tenno persevere, while the inept are left to drown.",

This game is an instance based mmo that offers great action based combat, with a nice sample size of frames(characters) to choose from. I will warn you now to ONLY continue to play this game if you absolutely ADORE the combat like I did. There is literally nothing to do in endgame but to grind for gear you don't need to make platinum(premium currency) or trying out new weapons and frames. You will spend hours upon hours grinding pointlessly.  I will tell you now, the frames are definitely all unique and fun to play, since that will be your only fresh of breath air throughout the game, Although the weapons are pretty stale. Sure, there are a lot of weapons to choose from... but only a small sample size of them are even viable in high level content, like 60 minute+ survival missions. In order to be relevant in raids you have to have mods that are very expensive to aquire as they are limited time items that only other players have. You will spend a lot of time doing nothing, as every time you craft a new weapon, frame, or quest item, it takes 12-32 hours to make in REAL TIME. You can of course speed up the process with some platinum.  I am happy to tell you that yes, you CAN get everything in this game for free. Although it will take a LOT of time. There is no auction house in this game, so you are forced to trade 1v1 with other players, negotiating and advertising your items. Again, more of a time sink, and in a sense, more grind, as you have to sit there and spam the things you are selling into chat until someone shows interest in it. It has taken me upwards to 5 hours to sell even highly sought after items, so be warned.   PVP in this game is laughable at best. You start off with no mods for your frame and have to participate in the PVP to get a chance at a good mod dropping that you can actually use. You can also buy the mods with platinum that you make from PVE content, which is probably the better route. So for those that like PVP be warned, you will have to endure getting smashed on by players who have invested more time in it than you to eventually be relevent. Even when you finally do get the mods you need to play PVP enjoyably, you will probably be highly disappointed at the fact that the incredible combat in the PVE portion of this game is not even taken advantage of in PVP. Every player you come across will literally ninja flip constantly and snipe you with high single target guns.   If you can tolerate massive grind and the combat of this mmo is enough to drive you to play it, then by all means give it a shot.",

I will not go into the abusive devs, but they are abusive. Even by writing this review I have a risk of being banned. The devs HATE negative feedback. They threten to ban people for saying blank isn't good, it's bad.   An example of when I saw this was when the void trader comes to visit warframe and sells unwanted items.  I would recommend this game if it didn't feel like a waste of time after getting far in the game. It looses the spark of potential when you get everything and find out there is nothing 'fun' to do. When I say 'fun', I mean new things that are not repeditive. The maps feel the same because they are just puzzle pieces being reused. There are too many updates in the game to fix bugs the devs should have known about. If the devs cared about the game, they would have spread out the updates to once a week at most to give time for debuging. The devs could also take the critisism from the community, instead of blocking/banning them. If I made a game, I would expect tons of hate from the community if I made a mistake. These devs should expect the same and should stay cool headed when reading the hate from the community. To be honest these devs feel like minecraft server admins, threatning to ban people for saying something bad about them/the game.  O.K now that im done with the rant about how the levels are repeditive and the devs are rude to the players, lets move onto the shop item and their prices.  THE SHOP ITEMS ARE WAY OVERPRICED. When I say that, I mean that even the community sells the items for less. This could be a good thing, or a bad thing if you are new to the game and dont know about the community market. For those who are new to the game and are looking for a price listings of all items go to: warframe.market . Why is this important? Why are you bashing on the market prices? As someone who didn't KNOW that this market even existed, I wasted 50 or so plat on a crappy weapon in the store. ALSO DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON PLAT UNTIL YOU GET 75% off. I wasted so much more money on buying plat when I didn't have a discount. If I were you and you got a 50% discount or even a 25% discount, I would to wait for the 75% discount because 50% isn't much of a discount compared to 75%. It would also be cool if the discount applied to prime access.  My total review: Game expirience: 7/10 Dev expirience: 3/10(inexpirienced devs need to take critizism cool headed. Might change if they never ban me for this review) Shop prices 1/10(too expensive compared to the community's market) Update ratings: 6/10 Server speed: Upgraded from a potato to a watermellon(4/10)  Probs going to get banned for not recommending this game cause negative feedback is something devs ban for. I don't care though, cause the truth needs to be seen by someone.",

            "review_text": "In Warframe, you play as a Tenno, a member of a species of ancient warriors that have reemerged to lay waste to the various nefarious species populating the solar system. Your foes include the Grineer, a jackbooted army of deteriorating humanoid clones; the Corpus, a mix-and-match crew of robotic and human parts; and the Infestation, a bunch of shambling organic creatures that vaguely resemble the Flood from the Halo series. While your enemies are visually uninteresting, a lot of the Tenno suits and weapons have a great sense of style that imbues Warframe with a spark of personality. Each species has a cursory backstory, and there is some lore to be found buried in the menus, but there's no narrative thrust or intrigue to speak of. And so you run mission after mission, moving outward from the sun as you level up your loadout and become a more proficient killer.The core combat of Warframe is straightforward. This is a third-person action game in which you wield two primary weapons and a melee weapon against foes who are largely content to come right at you. You also gain suit powers that allow you to dash and slash through a bunch of enemies, or stun all foes within a certain radius, though these abilities can change drastically depending on what suit you equip. You could unleash fiery maelstroms, turn invisible, create a decoy, use teleportation to switch places with an enemy, or manipulate your foes to fight against their allies. Acquiring new suits, however, requires a significant investment of time or money.Regardless of what powers you have equipped, you can often wage effective war against your enemies by firing on them from a distance, then slicing up the ones who manage to get close. This tactic grows tiresome after a while, however, and doesn't serve you well as you take on tougher levels. Fortunately, you can combine your ability to jump, sprint, and crouch into an acrobatic array of slides, flips, jump kicks, wall runs, leaping slashes, and more. Though there's a certain rigidity to your movement, your mobility is one of the most interesting and enjoyable things about Warframe, and it's fun to zip around your enemies, slashing and shooting until the only ones left standing are your fellow Tenno.You can run Warframe missions with up to three other players, and while flying solo is definitely possible in the early going or when you're grinding for experience or resources, teaming up becomes necessary as you tackle tougher missions. ighting your way through fiendish hordes with the help of some allies can be very satisfying, especially when there's a good mix of powers in play. Coordinating with friends is the best way to get this kind of experience, because jumping into matches or having folks join you can lead to lopsided situations.If there's a gap in player level or a mismatch with the mission challenge, as often happens, your cooperative missions can devolve into all-out sprints as players easily cut their way through enemies they far outclass.To minimize such gaps, you can focus on playing only new missions, since those tend to scale toward the upper bound of your capabilities. To spice things up, you may want to acquire a new gun, a new melee weapon, or a new suit. Warframe is free to play, but you must spend either time or money to acquire new items. Currently, new suits range roughly from $5 to $25, with new weapons falling close to the lower end of that spectrum. Alternatively, you can purchase blueprints to craft new weapons and suits using in-game currency. It takes a significant amount of time to save up the money for a new blueprint, and then you must spend even more time acquiring the resources to actually craft it.Even if you skip the lengthy crafting process by using real-world currency, you still have to spend time leveling up your new gear. Jumping into a high-level mission with a brand-new suit is a death sentence, so it's back to lower levels to grind for experience. As your gear levels up, you gain more slots to modify it using boosters picked up during combat. Adding abilities to suits, improving the attributes of your gear, and imbuing your weapon with elemental damage are just some of the things mods can do. Unfortunately, the system to apply and improve mods is poorly laid out and barely explained, leaving you on your own to figure things out.Some problematic menus pale in comparison to Warframe's real problem: a pervasive tendency toward repetition. Whether you're forging ahead with a high-level suit or leveling up a new one, Warframe repeats enemies, environments, and scenarios too frequently. Without new challenges for your combat abilities, the excitement soon dries up, leaving you without a compelling reason to keep playing.As it is now, Warframe's interesting combat mechanics are too quickly overcome by the grind of repetition.",

Want to progress the game? Well TOO BAD. There's an hour-long alert that you can't do cause it's LEVEL 60.

But now, having progressed much further, i've found that most things could be acquired with just time and patience, and the only things that truly required platinum were cosmetics and bundles. And platinum is a tradable currency, so if you really want x that costs y platinum, you could make platinum by trading with other players. But is the game fun? Yes, it's loads of fun.

WELL THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!! If you are that type of chum who can't be bothered to grind endlessly, well this game has that covered. If you steal your mother's credit card you can buy a fortune of in-game currency which can be used on useless accessories and weapons that will only get nerfed or ignored later on, with this current deal you can also get this PREMIUM ITEMS like that #MLG420SMOKEWEEDEVERYDAYSOMAPRIME and African lady Prime. Also do go to the forums if you like to talk to people that like to spam the word '#PL0XBUFFSOMAANDSOMAPRIMESGEGRTGREG'  Alright time to be serious. Don't play this game, the community on the forums are fairly crap, you get to the point where everything gets extremely boring. I took a haitus from it one time and only came back to find the soma to be primed and Nova. The 2 things I actually do hate, they are fairly bland and generic for a game of Hand-laz0rs. Also don't buy plat and if you do buy it, just make sure you use it wisely. But despite if you do read all this and do continue to play it, I don't mind if you do, just keep in mind about the community on the forums and keep an eye out for anymore shifty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from the Devs.   *Update post* Well I ain't touching this god awful game ever ♥♥♥♥ing again, after the devs released the ♥♥♥♥ing Soma Weapon set I'm ♥♥♥♥ing done with such a ♥♥♥♥ community and dev team. Think something better than simple 'HURR DURR WEPS THAT SHOT NORMAL BULLETS PEW PEW!' DE is literally scooping ♥♥♥♥ from the bottom of the septic tank at weapon ideas and ideas in general.  Alright yes I've gotten back into this game, I've noticed that, once you get into End-game type of stage. It gets ♥♥♥♥ing addictive, like drugs. And it really creeps me out that now I'm constantly being active again despite me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over this game. It's just that once you've gone to far into it. You just can't get out of it any longer, due to all the ♥♥♥♥ that you've collected and the such. Honestly it's gone to the point where it isn't funny anymore. Also Raids on Nightmare give me brain hernias cause people can't organise or just sheer ♥♥♥♥ luck that something happens.  Edit something something: So it's like now 25/07/16 or for you americans it's 07/25/16. I haven't touched this game since like May of this year. Even before that I've just slowly played here and there. Warframe gets old pretty quickly these days. 'NEW CONTENT OH BOI!' 'ENDLESS FARMING MORE UNREASONABLE THAN MONSTER HUNTER! OH BOI MY FAVOURITE!' Just get ♥♥♥♥ing boring eventually, tbh this means I've stopped playing altogether at this point. If my friends asked me to hop on then I might just to show off I'm an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with Lato Vandal. But I heard that they will be re-releasing Lato Vandal and Braton Vandal. So no point in that. Kinda ashame that it was actually fun while DE wasn't a bunch of cuckadians. Good ♥♥♥♥ doesn't last as they say.",

            "review_text": "I wanted to like this, but couldn't. The biggest thing that jumps out at you is that this isn't a game that has grind, it's a game that was built around grind as a primary design mechanic, and overall purpose in the game. I don't mean Diablo or Borderlands type grind, but incredibly dull, mindless, painful grind, where often the best option, is very low level missions you can just tear apart with ease, or to just leech away in public games.  While it has a number of nice concepts, it unfortunately fails to execute them very well. Worst among those being the painfully grind centric, and RNG related progression mechanic, rather limited variety of loot that feels more like resource gathering, than loot collecting, and the overall poor game balance. Although this is shaping up to be one of those infinite beta type games (with a functioning cash shop), as there's always various aspects marked as coming soon, currently being redesigned, or reredesigned. With some of the changes forcing you to wonder if much thought went into them at all, while others are seemingly focused on just looking cool, rather than if it would be an enjoyable game mechanic.  The 'Space Ninjas' thing is a marketing gimmick, as stealth in the game is not a good option, and only semi-functional in one of the mission types. Although if you play with others they always just charge in with guns blazing like space marines. Mob AI is inept, they like to run in circles, then often take cover while standing behind explosive barrels, things that only cover their lower half, or just right out in the open. The parkour only sort of works, some of the time, the rest of the time it either doesn't trigger, or slingshots you off at mach 10. Warframe certainly has it's fair share of bugs in general. I have all too often had to abort a mission, giving up all my item rewards, because the door to the next area wouldn't open, the last mob was stuck underground, the next sequence didn't trigger, or so on.  It might shape up to be a really good game at some point along the line, should it ever get out of beta, and they really sit down to figure out how to get everything to work together effectively. Although, as it is right now, I couldn't recommend this to anyone.",

            "review_text": "I've been a veteran for quite a long time, both when it comes to Warframe as well as games produced by Digital Extremes.  I'd like to first off say that this game has plenty of potential, plenty to do, and plenty to own, from guns, to companions, and so on.  I'd also like to say that the game is extremely labourious to get credits, experience, and mods to work up the ability to get the 'spacebux' you need to get slots and the like. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING (except Prime Access) can be gathered by extensive amounts of farming.  But about the farming, that's all this game is. Farming for crafting materials. Farming for mods. Farming for parts for a particular frame or a certain weapon. Farming...farming..farming...farming...  If you have a lot of time on your hands, this game is enjoyable up until you reach the point of boredom, which is around Mastery Rank 8 and above. Though it's fun to excel, it's doubtable that you'll have any reason to come back once your collection is complete until the next event or major update comes around.  This is not a statement that this game is bad, by no means. This is just the tip of the iceberg.  The pros of this game span further than the cons. +Despite the farming, it is relatively easy to get what you need outside of a few choice materials. With a good hour of gathering, you'll have a decent amount of resources at your disposal (god forbid nanospores). If time is on your side, expect the ability to level up quickly and grab parts for good weapons in no time! +There are weekly updates and constant hotfixes, Unless you have a terrible computer and/or a major (non-weekly) update drops, these download in no time via the launcher. +Content is constantly added with weekly updates (most of the time they keep to the statement for said weekly updates). +The developers actually partake in their own game to help find bug fixes, get ideas for content, even showcase biweekly to give the community a head's-up on what will come, what's in mind, and so on. +Support is quite easy to get ahold of, even if it does take a day or so. (Much like the Blues of Blizzard's support team).  But now for the cons... -Sometimes they tend to alter their scripts so much that it either breaks the game for the OS you run, or for certain specs in your system. -Once again, labourious if you cannot spend time in game to gather resources and the like. -Certain mods are like the Colossal Squid...elusive, and thought to be a myth. -Some members of the community can be extreme ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. -Cross-platform (PC to console and vice versa) not available. (Side note: You can transfer your PC account to console once in a blue moon, but not the other way around for contractual reasons.) -Primarily considered pay-to-win because of the slow nature of gathering resources and money, even for a minimalistic trade for small amounts of 'platinum' to get slots to hold weapons and warframes.   I could ramble on and on, but to me, I find that the pros outweigh the cons.  I recommend this game, whole-heartedly, if you enjoy sci-fi third-person action based games with guns. 'Nough said.",

Just keep moving along with the missions. You'll have an generous number of warframe and weapon blueprints after you finish the missions on the first 4-5 planets. I'd recommend staying in online mode as you can move through the missions more smoothly with a group (and it's more fun). I've only rarely run into a bad/abusive player as the community for this game is surprisingly good.  Don't spend you Platinum (real world cash) on characters or weapons!

But, I gave it a chance and boy was I wrong. This Co-operative space ninja game with out-of-this-world graphics blew me away and I asked my friend that surely they would charge money for this but he said,  'Free forever, forever fun.'    The customization of this is astounding from various weapons, colors, materials, and even warframes (which are utilitzed as weapons too). The game designers also implemented loot rooms in the more difficult 'Void' tilesets that require you to use your Warframe's ability to basically do parkour to go places where you typically wouldn't think. Personally, it feels like if  Mirror's Edge  and  Team Fortress 2  birthed a demigod of a child that had some awesome genetic mutations.   I currently have logged over a  hundred hours  and with the release of Update 11, I'm predicting many more.   My rating?  10/10  for superb graphics, engrossing gameplay, and endless customization.

I just wanted to buy cosmetics and support the developers. With a couple of exceptions of content reserved to Founders (people who funded the game's initial development), there is no gear that is locked behind a paywall (and their exclusive gear isn't even good). Only some cosmetics are locked behind a pay wall, and most other cosmetics can still be bought with platinum. Platinum being the game's premium currency, which can be traded between players for rare gear that drops in missions you can play for free. This game has the best free to play model of any I've played. One of my favorite aspects being, there are no premium or non-premium accounts. Every player is equal.  What about gameplay? Well the amount of playstyles and weapons offered to the player will keep you trying new things for a very long time. As of writing this there are 29 unique classes (refered to as Warframes, roll credits) in the game, with a 30th to be added in the coming months. There are hundreds of weapons to choose from, and almost half of them are actually good. Movement is fluid and satisfying, with momentum giving weight to the player's actions.   Story in Warframe didn't really used to matter. But over time, lore was built into a world that is really shaping up. Through quests outright telling you things, to passing comments from NPCs, and codex entires gained by scanning an enemy enough times, a universe is crafted that will keep you interested and wanting to know more. There's more to this story and the answers are waiting.  Endgame is not very well defined at the moment, but hopefully that will change sometime this year. Fashionframe is the true endgame anyway.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes action. There is likely to be something for you in here. Want to grab an assault rifle and mow down enemies? You can do that. Want to use powerful abilities to clear a room? You can do that. Want to take a big sword and cut everything in half? Go ahead. There is something for everyone.",

Also, premium currency is tradable in the community trading market, which makes the game fun and playable without paying. Not saying that if you don't pay 40$ you won't have very good stuff and destroy normal missions, but you don't need to pay that much. The game is very fun and skipping everything is useless, because you can aquire everything just by playing. Great game in all, although it has a couple ''Pay2Skip'' features. Watever, I love it.",

I will like try to share the expirience I had with the game so far so keep in mind that everything I say about the game is my personal opinion and it doesn't have to match with yours. First whats so good about the game?  1. It's free to play right? Even if you dont enjoy the game you didn't pay sh*t to play it  2. Multiplayer. Warframe is like 90% about playing with your friends/guild members. What a surprize since it is MMO, right?  3. Tons of content. There is like a 1000000 of different weapons, warframes and even events/alert missions.  4. Graphics. Warframe has such a beautiful graphics for a F2P game, it even competes with some of the greater non-F2P games (imo)  5. Character customization. OK, it's not like Blade&amp;Soul level of character customization, but it's still really good. Every Warframe has it's own skins and you can recolor litteraly everything. Even the pets and ship etc etc.  6. Map/Missions. The map in Warframe is really big, right? It's like the whole solar system. On each planet you have like 15-20 missions and if you dont like doing that much stuff before moving to the next planet, dont worry. You only have to complete a couple of missions in order to unlock the next planet.  7. The game gets a lot of updates in which new weapons, warframes or enemies are added. Sometimes even new mission types, raids or boss remakes but none of these are actually that common.  8. If lore is something you like about games dont worry, because warframe got a lot of lore and more is yet to come. If you dont like it, well nobody is forcing you to watch the cinematics or read the lore. It's up to you.  9. It's not pay2win. The only thing you can buy with premium currency (platinum) and not with normal currency (credits) are some skins and resources from shop. Thats it. Everything else you can get simply by playing. Plus you can get platinum from trading with other players, so you dont even have to spend money to get these skins  Sounds pretty nice for an F2P games, right? But it has it's cons. Not much, but pretty significant ones.  1. Grind. Everything you do in warframe is grinding resources, bosses and other suff. Over some time grinding the basic stuff gets boring. But there are many ways to speed up the farming.  2. End game. This is the reason I don't play much lately. Not so far ago, EG/endless EG missions (Void missions) you had to do in order to get EG stuff got removed from the game and instead Void Nodes got added, I won't explain what these are because it would be pretty long. In short, huuuuge part of EG was removed, but more EG weapons are being added and investing time in upgrading them is like completely useless right now because all you would get from that is overkilling the enemies even more.  OK, that's it. I would recommend warframe to you if you wanted to play it for some time AND to play it with friends. Rating: 5/10 before 100 hrs; 9/10 100-1000 hrs; 7,5/10 1000+ hrs Hope this review helped :) PS. Sorry for my english, it's not my mother langage :P",

Graphics - fantastic, sharp crisp colours and imagery that catches the eye Gameplay- simple, and is flexible to allow users to play dual xbox 360 controller and keyboard at the same time XP System- the more you use a weapon you level up, ranking system is interesting and thus far it's easy on the new/casual/pro player  Overall rating: 9.5 out of 10 Stars  The one thing I would like to be added if not implemented to add the ability to gain platinum through missions so that it can be obtained without paying real world money for it.",

Its FREE, whats not to like. there is absolutly no reason for you not to try it out if you haven't already and if you have and you are burned out, get some friends, make a caln with a name that only you guys would understand, and do void missions and make millions of bucks (or credits).  I have spent a lot of time playing warframe. I made my account a little over a year ago in update 13. Since then, the game is almost un recognizable. The only things that are the same are the weapons, warframes, a couple of the bosses, and a couple of the tile sets. This is why I have been kept to one burn out in that time.  When I started playing warframe, my most played game on steam was star wars battlefront 2 and I had 24 hours on it. My friends got me into warframe right as summer break started and I spent almost the entire summer playing warframe (Half ot that time was probably spent farming nerodes for anyone who remembers farming survival on earth). I burned out aound update 14.5 and didn't get back into it until update 16.5. That might sound like a long time but it was only a couple of months. That is how fast the game changes. The devs are always working to change the game for the better and you can see that in all of the content the devs post on twitch and youtube.  Warframe is like any other online gam, it is going to be hard for new players to fit in. Warframe is very grindy. I have heard people call it warfarm because the farm involved can get extremely intense. However if you can handle the farm, The result is very rewarding.  Another thing that turns people off warframe is that it is free. The steriotipical free game now is full of in game purchases . Warframe does have in game purchases but by no means do you need to buy anything. That being said, If you ask anyone who has been playing the game for a while, 999999/100000 of them will tell you they have bought some amount of platinum (what you buy). There is no reason to say that warframe is pay to win and that is why you don't play it. Everything can be obtained in game without platinum except cosmetics which don't really do anything but look different.  Overall, Warframe is a fantastic game. If you can put up with the grind and the ocassonal bugs (which are usually pretty hilarious) and you like RPGs, you should try this game out.",

            "review_text": "Game type: MMO / Third person / Free2Play (but in a good way!) / Shooter / Hack and Slash / RPG.  This one is very different from most pay2plays out there. You can reliably get almost anything in-game that you could want. I am sure there are one or two things only available to people who have paid money into the game, but any weapon or warframe worth having, can drop during the game. All without endlessly farming for the same materials. You can end up with great weapons, skills and 'warframes' (the games answer to a suit of mech armor.. I guess) just by playing the game regularly. No extra, obnoxious farming.. although you will probably be 'farming' for hours anyways.. levelling up your,  everything  is key to having the most powerful weapons and skills.   Skills.. oh my god if I could describe how the skills can vary from person to person, warframe to warframe, weapon to weapon it would take me a degree in math and I would still have to write an entire article in order to describe it. (A tutorial would take an entire wiki). You level up (your account) on a fairly regular basis.. but can only take the test to level up once every 24hrs. This however doesn't impede your ability to progress and make gains on your character/frame/weapon combination, as each fight may drastically alter the way that you choose to play  your  game permanently, or perhaps just for certain missions. Anyways, it's been said before.. but never by me- The possibilities are nearly endless. They are legitimately endless if development continues on the game and the growth is exponential with each update.  No need to worry about Mic-spamming kids in this game, the voice-chat is nearly unusable, and encourages the use of teamspeak.  My advice, get a group together (either IRL friends or use the lobby to  quickly  put together a squad of unstoppable ninja!) and get into this game, it's the only way you'll understand.. and remember when playing - The wiki is written by people with experience and will save you hours of potentially wasted time.  Good luck, and honestly.. try it out. You will probably like it.",

In Warframe, you are a warrior with a special 'warframes' suit equipped with wide variety of unique abilities and advantages it provide. Usual gameplay can be defined as eliminating enemies in a mission, surviving, defending, espionage and occational speical missions with rather different objectives. Goal of the game is not completely set, you can play to complete the 'lore' quests that contains cinematic explaination ofnthe story behind the current universe, the story is not yet complete as developers are adding more features along with frequent development in cinematic story line. Aside from the quests, you are free to pursue whatever gamemode or objectives, there are random occasionaln 'alerts' that is available from time to time with many rewards, also you can run seasonal sorties to not to get sick of doing same thing over and over. The game is still being developed and additional contents are being added as time comes also, there is a solid community out there keeping game alive and beating.  Going further, you are able to go on missions to 'voids' to get versatile, better 'prime' weapons and 'prime' warframes which helps you in exploring high difficulty missions. As it is for most of Free-To-Play games, there is an option to purchase in-game currency which could potentially reduce your time spent on void and support the game developers. The in-game currency can be easily earned/traded by selling prime stuff and weapon/warframe modifications to other players owning the currency and you can pretty much buy crucial things without purchasing it with real money. When you are well euipped enough, you can now actually enjoy the game by playing random missions,alerts and sorties but you have to keep in mind that you could experience burn-out if you focus too much on grinding in voids to collect primes so please do try to play game for actual FUN.",

Sadly while I was able to play some levels my PC was trash and so Warframe begone for 1 year from my life. Then I bought bigger, better PC and was able to have fun with my Frames once more. But then after 90 hurs of gameplay it just felt a little boring. Endless grind was killing all the fun, and also at that time missions were looking same no matter if it was infiltration or excavation. Now after another 1 year gap I feel kind of sad. Mainly becouse this 1 year was great for Warframe and I missed all those cool events and new missions that gave new life to this game. I hope it will see another few years of development.",

Most will pick Second Dream because of the 'unexpected'. No, am not gonna spoil for non-warframe and anyone who did not play WF or just started out and have yet to play it.

And yes, that’s what Warframe was for a while… Unplayable, confusing, straight up bad...    But this game has seen in its one and a half year of existence, more attention than any other game I have ever played, and it was attention from the Devs, and Players alike. Its step by step evolution from unplayable to epic was a long journey, one that I was a part of. Warframe is now closer to the final draft than ever before, and in my opinion is one of the few fun and original shooters out there…   The current mechanics offer a great spice up to the genre and the co-op focused nature of the game makes it feel like an epic RPG rather than a generic VS shooter…  The amazing character designs and settings, the concept and the lore of the game are delivered in an amazing way. They make this game pleasant without much unnecessary dialogue and cutscenes, and the ran-gen nature of the map and enemies, is a powerful tool, than ensures differentiation in weapons and tactics, even if you are to play the same level again, you will never find the same enemies at the same place, using the same gun…  Don’t let the “Free to play” scare you away! Warframe is a no-Paywall game… You can craft everything in there through normal gameplay, get the materials and build all the things! Or you can buy them with platinum to support the game! (You need Platinum to buy weapons slots and cosmetics)  Yes, Warframe is not a perfect game, and it’s not a finished game… It can be really frustrating at times and it lacks many things. But it’s finally on the right path. Seeing a game get from unplayable to amazing doesn’t happen often. But what I always saw, is that Warframe has this, sort of retrieving quality… Maybe it’s the community, maybe it’s the huge flow of quality content, maybe it’s just the stunning way this game looks, maybe it’s the sheer fun this game exhales, maybe it's the people that I met in the game, the tenno in my clan, or maybe it’s just me… I could never stop playing this game…  It’s only clear that we have a gem in our hands, and that it gets brighter every day…   Warframe, you won!

I have been addicted to this game. (Have about 145 hours or something like that of playtime on it) I usually get addicted to games for a little bit but this is the longest addiction I have ever had. The game is really fun especially when you play with friends, it can be really easy but also insanely challenging and I think the developers did a good job on balancing the resources and difficulties out. There are so many amazing Warframes and weapons to choose from and I love how you have to earn everything, like to get a Warframe you have to do certain missions to get the parts and then you have to get resources to build those parts. It makes you become really proud of yourself after finishing something! :D It does involve premium currency but you can actually earn that without buying it so nothing is impossible for you to get. I haven't been involved with the community a whole lot but I do know that everyone is friendly and easy to get along with, two nice people joined my public match once and it was quite fun. :) There is this thing called a Dojo and that's basically where you and your clan can hang out, you can build rooms, labs, decorations, etc. To be honest I am obsessed with building up my Dojo.  I think that's all I'm going to tell, there is so much more that I haven't told but you can discover everything on your own. If you're unsure about playing this don't be, after all the game is free!

If more game creators could look at this game they could learn a thing or two. I even run this on all low at 1280x720 and this game still looks amazing. All I hope to see is some vs mode stuff like TDM, and Capture The Flag.

If you are here for some of the best 3rd person combat (shooting &amp; melee), solid co-op multiplayer, a fantastic leveling/upgrading system that really allows for some personal custimaztion based on your playstyle, and very (VERY) pretty graphics in an engine that runs incredibly well, then you are here for the right reasons.   My biggest issue with the game used to be the lack of variety in environments, but that is no longer a problem. From when I started playing the game in closed beta, there are now 3-4 times as many areas. With the different mods in each area (now twice as many modes) and the randomly generated maps (as in the style of Diablo II &amp; III), environments are very varied.  Of course, with it a F2P game, you're likely skeptical about whether or not it is Pay2Win or not. While it isn't as fair of a model as Loadout or Path of Exile, it is probably the best model out there. I logged around 200 hours before ever spending money and I only used that money to buy weapon slots and visual upgrades seeing as how it's so much fun to actually earn weapons and frames in this game.  I would say this game is 1 part Mass Effect 3's multiplayer, 1 part Left4Dead, and 1 part Prince of Persia/Mirrors Edge. If that sounds like a great time to you (I hope it does), then start downloading. Again, it is free and also the game is a pretty darn small file size.   5/5",

It is a freerun (very good movement to get quickly around the maps), coöp ninja space hack'n slash shooter. It has many different area's and in each area it generates a new order of chambers to make the completion run slightly different every time. Also it's free to play so why wouldn't you try it out?   The PvP isn't really great, but it is mostly a coöp PvE game anyway. This game is much about farming resources and bleuprints for new equipment, weapons and suits/characters. There is a trading system in game to make getting the prime bleu prints easier. You can ofcourse spend money on additional stuff (it isn't a pay to win game). It isn't necessary to do so, by using trading you can get those items anyway but it'll take way longer ofc. I had played this game for more then 1800 hours before spending money on it, I have now though, because I wanted some skins and didn't want to sit in trading chat for a while.  If you become really good at playing and speeding trough missions, it can become kind of a bore and annoyance to drag noob players across the map. If I play a non highest tier mission with players that are not on my friend list, 99% of the games I play will result in me having done more 90% of all damage and me waiting at a door that needs 2 players to open....   Also there is not really much of an end game and if you want to play this game for melee mostly then don't, it's a shooter and although they buffed melee a bit by adding some new mods and changing it a bit, shooting is still way more viable and less spammy. If you want to go full melee, I'd say make a macro that just spams E on toggle or something similar.  Conlusion: It's good and free, by far my most played game on steam.",

            "review_text": "Warframe, a Free-to-Play cooperative game, that implies the title of 'Free-to-Play.'  The story of Warframe? Not too much is known, but a basic understanding of it is - it's a spiratual sequel to Dark Sector, which pulls some ties in from said game like the Technocyte Virus etc. You are Tenno, a species of human mutated from the Technocyte Virus. The suit, known as a Warframe is the suit that gives the user increased power. The Lotus, the one who guides the Tenno, asks of you to restore the balance to a universe at war. That is a very broad understanding of the story. There are various bits and pieces of lore in the Codex, but I'll keep the story asset brief.  The aesthetics of the game are pretty original, mostly harkening with the Warframes especially. Everything looks sleek and organic. It's charming to say the least.  As for the game itself, it is pretty fun. While people start out with a minimal amount of equipment, which can be considered a subtracting point, the player is given fifty starting paid-for currency, enough for a mixture of Warframe slots and weapon slots. These slots allow you to acquire more Warframes and weapons throughout your career as a Tenno. The starter equipment aforementioned which excludes the unique choice of Warframe, is nothing to write home about - a slow-firing automatic rifle, a basic sidearm and sword. But those aren't your only weapons you can acquire; a plethora of weapons can be utilized at the players own discretion. Things like 'heavy' automatic rifles, to whips, to lightning-chaining weapons.  The only problem being with the weapons, are the same-y aspects of them. Most bullet-based weapons behave like a laserbeam; accurate at all distances, with little felt recoil. As well, most of these weapons aren't 'unique.' Very few can be considered unique, but that doesn't stop the same aspect as above.   The Warframes themselves are unique. Each one respects a different element in themselves. While it may take a few runs to get the components (this will be elaborated further), they are a powerful addition to anyone who can utilize them effectively. Ember can use her flames to scorch the masses, Frost can utilize his abilities to protect hardpoints or teammates alike. Things like these help make the game varied with different ways to play.  With weapons and Warframes comes building them. You can buy these from the in-game market, coming in two flavors - the Platinum (paid) edition, or the DIY edition. Buying with paid-for currency, not only yields the weapon/Warframe in question, but it being supercharged (more mod points), and a free weapon/Warframe slot. DIY is where you need the components and resources to build said item. Things like Alloy Plate, Plastids, to a Warframe Chassis, Helmet and Systems, all funnel into the crafting system.  The crafting system is not state-of-the-art, as you cannot create multiples of the same item (Ie: I can only build one Health Restore, wait until it is finished building, then craft another one...), but this is where all of the aspects show the Free-to-Play mantra. Everything can be acquired in the game trough the usage of in-game currency and time. If you want to build a Warframe? Do you have at least a few days? You can build him/her. Want that shiny new weapon? Have twelve hours to a day to spare? Build it.  To elaborate further, weapons and Warframes can be enhanced even further with the use of mods. They are just basic alterations, that can squeeze out more power out of your weapons. Basic damage upgrades to elemental damages, things like that can help you progress even further. Simple as that. Getting an Orokin Catalyst or Reactor will fuel more mod points into your weapons and Warframes respectively. But that doesn't mean that there are 'essential' mods, which make certain mods more useless than others. I won't go into detail into that, but some mods are unquantifiably essential than others.  Another part of the game is... Grinding. It is part of every game to increase the longevity of the game. RNG rules all in this department, whether it is to get a component or a mod. This might be a slight turn-off point for many, and is a slight brick wall. You'll have to do a lot of said act to acquire the best gear. It takes a large sum of time to get maximum power. To lessen this is trading. You can trade mods or paid currency to get those mods you can't get, or cheese through the effort of getting one.  All in all, Warframe is fun if you can get passed the grinding. Better with a group of friends, as most games are. The only problem is the early-game, grinding and some of the wait-times. Would I recommend it? It is free, so why not?  If you get this far, then thanks for reading. Have fun!",

Suprisingly fair business model, you dont have to pay a thing, ever, if you dont care about keeping every single weapon (you totally dont have to). A good amount of the guns haver their own firing mechanics, and the new mod system allows for weapons to be buffed against certain enemies and purposes.  The DOWNS: Can get grindy, very very CPU intense. Some of you might be put off by constant changes to the balance that the game is undergoing in the last half year. But thats why its a beta, and it wont go on for long. Another prolbem at the moment is that two of the tilesets are somewhat overused, but those get slowly replaced as new tilesets come along.

Limited Customization for starters, being limited to 3 Warframes and a small pallete of colors, but still fair in terms of unlocking weapons and crafting other frames.  Warframes offer plenty of playstyles, however, certain playstyles, like stealth, are unrewarding compared to just running through the levels with someone who can blow everything up.  Certain weapons are useless, other weapons are OP, creating an uneven field and also making the game boring by having less variety until weapons are balanced.  Unique movement system, however can be greatly improved upon if the devs worked on it. Current movement has wallrunning, sliding, and using melee weapons to turn yourself into a helicopter due to the speed boost from swinging it.  Despite this, many viable playstyles and a decent amount of variety, but again, would be more variety should other weapons be balanced.  Terrible AI, the AI is very dumb. Some AI are just faster than others and can perform different manuevers, however, they still lack a logical thinking process. Many will run up to you head-on, or will hide and take cover and allow you to pick them off, without thinking to move. Bosses have unique prospects, but are still pretty stupid.  Game currently only rewards rushing, stealth is not possible, and few tactical options outside of warframe abilities.  Very few variety between missions, there is defense, survival and extermination, along with another mission type which involves blowing up an object.

Okay so you level up and grind untill you have such an over powerd warframe that you can take on the later levels with ease, but guess what? now you have access to the void on wow! this game is soo indepth I never saw this coming new levels and everything. The enemies get a new skin, do more damage and its all pretty much the same but in these levels staying alive 20 minutes or more only gets you the good resources, so you gotta keep grinding. Just keep swimming for the ultimate goal right? what goal? you allready have all you want, oh but what about that one warframe that you dont have Vulban, who can only be unlocked by spending all your waking hours on the game to catch the 3 alert missions you need to grab all his parts, they come and go randomly in the game and sometimes only last an hour, without all 3 parts you cant build ♥♥♥♥ and are left with no way of gaining the others untill you find and play the next super rare alert mission.

There are some slight problems with it, the level design is lacking, there needs to be more creative mission types, and going solo in this game is never the best way to play. I would give a 9 out 10, it truly an awsome game. SO download it now and play it. (DID I MENTION IT's FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)",

How they fitted all this into under 2GB is pretty damn amazing. Highly recommended and awesome good fun to play with friends, solo or online with random squad members. Why it got a metacritic rate of 67% I just have no idea. My favourite game for quite some time.",

            "review_text": "Warframe  Warframe started as a decent co-op shooter.  On early beta it had some game breaking bugs, but it felt like it had a lot of potential, that potential is still there and i doubt it will fade away easily.  The level design is pretty amazing, the tilesets have as much quality as a AAA title but they get very repetitive with time, the 'endgame' void missions can be described as 'kill mobs, loot the room and occasionally look for secrets, rinse and repeat',  The Bosses started out as pretty meaningful and provided an actual challenge, nowadays they're a means to earn blueprints of specific frames and are incredibly hard, with the inclusion of a specific set of bosses that have a specific weak spot which only works half of the time. The best boss fight is in my honest opinion Lephantis.  Every update they release there are more bugs than additions, though most of which get solved pretty fast.  The game has become quite a farm fest, earning the game the term 'Warfarm'.   The Devs are terrible at balancing the game, specificly by overly nerfing frames and weapons and hardly ever buffing others.  The grinding involved in farming for frames is extreme and is a great drawback of the game.  Crafting weapons take usually 12 hours, companions and rare materials take up to 24 hours. the new Archwing takes 36 hours to build, and frames take 72 hours. Its tedious to wait so long for new gear.  This New Archwing update is lame, the new tileset in space is devoid of content, its literally the same map. starts in the same place, ends in the same place but has you go through different pathways to achieve your objective.   But to be quite honest, i've went on and on about how terrible this game is, but its still one of my favorite games and i have spent up to 8 hours in it alone, playing with friends.  It's got its share of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t sure, but they still somehow manage to deliver on a great time which is quite a feat, ive not exacly been easy on the examples of how terrible it is.  I'm not gonna rate this game on a scale of any sorts, its a great game to spend some time in, but its below average in key aspects and needs improvement, and a lot of it, then again it's still in 'open beta' so we might see some positive changes over the course of development.",

Since getting this game all that time ago, I have loved it. The combat is thrilling, the weapons are designed well, the movement is fast-paced and slick. The graphics are exceptional, especially for a free title. Each Warframe has its own kit of useful abilities, and despite what some people may say, they all have something positive to contribute to a squad. Personally, my favorite Warframes are (in order) Banshee, Chroma, Zephyr, Volt, Vauban, Hydroid, and Limbo. One of the major turn-offs to this game is the large grind required to advance, but with such an an immersive combat system, you won't get bored soon. Try Warframe, you will not be disappointed.",

Yes some reviews imply that this game is a grind fest, and it is true for some degree, but &amp; A BIG But The game devs need some income to sustain the development, so there are some shortcuts that can be payd for but it isnt required.

            "review_text": "Warframe is a third person, cooperative, free2play, action game with a strong sci-fi theme that emphasized fast-paced gunplay as well as melee combat.   What I like:  - Very stylish game, nice art style, unique aesthetic and you can do a lot of cool stuff like zipping around the level at high speeds, spinning through the air as a whirling tornado of blades and death and Max-Payne-Style bullet jumps while dual-wielding assault rifles - Large and ever expanding selection of weapons and abilities to use, there is something for everyone here. Want dual swords? Sure. Giant hammer? Of course. Machine guns that slice enemies to pieces? Yup. Shotgun-Axe-Hybrid-Thing? Yeah, game's got that too. - Large potential for optimization and different builds which is certain to please people that like to really get into the numbers game.  - Customization options are quite impressive. Even without paying for cosmetics you have a good number of options to make your character look the way you want. You can change the color of just about everything, including your 'hub area' space ship and a good number of cosmetics can be obtained just by playing the game. - Up until now (which is just over 50h in) the game has kept me motivated very well. It constantly throws new things at you (new weapons to craft and try out, access to more features, different mission types, etc.) even at this point which is nice.   What I don't like:  - A good number of systems that make up the meat of the game are barely explained if at all. If you want to get the most out of it, you'll have to read up on it outside the game. - Although the environments are generated somewhat randomly from pre-created tilesets it all blends together after a while and can get a bit samey. I recommend switching between the different planets frequently just to break it up a bit. - As is the nature of the beast, the game relies heavily on grinding for gear and replaying missions. This doesn't really bother me too much but I'm sure some people will be put off by playing the same mission 10 times in a row just to get the something they already have in abundance instead of the one piece they need.   Things to consider:  - While the game can be played solo for the most part it is definitely more enjoyable with a group, especially starting mid-game when the difficulty begins to ramp up. - I personally think the free2play model is well executed and fair, keeping most purchases completely optional. Many items in the item shop are priced quite highly though which - at least in my opinion - makes them not worth the money. I'd rather spend more time playing the game I enjoy then spending a lot of money on a shortcut. That said, there are a number of reasonably priced items in the shop that can enhance your game experience quite a bit. How you want to deal with that is of course up to you. It is entirely possible to get premium currency by selling rare items to other players for example so you don't have to spend actually money if you don't want to.   Conclusion:  I enjoy Warframe quite a bit and will surely continue to play more of it. Can't beat stylish space ninjas with lightning guns and fire swords.",

At this point you'll feel there's just so much in the game you need to do and unlock and build and kill.  At the 20-50 hour mark you'll most likely be looking into guides for the 'best' weapon builds and loadouts. Get a FOO-strategy crit-build Soma, Rhino, and Zorens and you'll be breezing through missions.  At the 100-or so hour mark and you'll have shiny Prime weapons or frames, maybe a couple, to show off. You would be pretty familiar with all the game mechanics at this point, and if not, you'll probably be reading the Wiki. Maybe you'll spend some cash as well on Platinum currency or Prime access.  At the 200 hour mark you'll be done with all the available missions, and spend the majority of your time running endless Defense or Survival missions to grind those Prime parts you don't have. You'll have your trusty overused Soma to kill waves on waves on waves of enemies, but RNGsus will not be with you.  At the 500 hour mark you might get bored of your Soma and start grinding other weapons, either to level up your Mastery rank or finding a new playstyle with quirky weapon builds. Maybe both. You might dabble a bit in PvP and kick ♥♥♥ or get your ♥♥♥ kicked. You'll probably have given up on open matchmaking due to all the yolo-ing squad mates who die and ragequit when you can't revive them in time.   At the 1000 hour mark you'll probably be logging in once a week, maybe less, just to breeze through new content. You'll have developed a superiority complex that gets stroked every time you leave your private session cave and see the after-mission results screen. Or you'll rationalize that the guy who outdid you was a (insert ability name)-spamming noob.",

            "review_text": "Boy oh BOY, where do I begin with this one? Strap in, folks, because this gets a little lengthy.  I suppose I should say this: The game isn't a bad play. It controls well, it's stupidly fun, and it has some great mechanics. Want a shotgun that can blow apart your enemies, all while trying to sneak around? You can do that! Want to slaughter everything in sight with nothing but a sword? You can do that, too! Heck, take out a FLAMING KNIFE and go ham!  But that's about where the fun stops. Sure, running around and coming up with creative ways to kill your targets is fun, but in order to get anywhere in the game, you need new weapons, new Warframes, a trusty companion...Not to mention the materials to make those things. Even when you've gotten your gear to their maximum rank, you still need the materials to take them further, or work on that Grakata you've had sitting around in your inventory for a couple of weeks (that is, of course, if you even HAVE the inventory space, which you have to BUY with ACTUAL MONEY)  And that's where the game becomes a real disappointment. MMO's have always had that grind that players, for the most part, seem to be okay with in general. In THIS game, however, that's what you'll be doing about 80% of the time. Need that blueprint for the Rhino Warframe's Chassis? Go beat this boss! Oh, wait, did you want the NEUROPTICS blueprint? You already have that one? TOO BAD, FIGHT THE BOSS AGAIN! At this point, it should be said that the devs, despite these issues (as well as those below) being brought up by not just new players, but VETERAN players, as well, tend to ignore the idea of making certain things less of a pain in the @$$ to get. They've also been known to implement new features, and rarely address new or existing problems until much later on. Some bosses, for example, are nearly impossible to beat without endless patience or sheer dumb luck. Of course, the same thing can be said about materials.  Blueprints from bosses? Okay, I can understand that. But look at the materials needed for just the systems. With the last update, grinding became an even bigger pain, as a lot of the higher-tier materials were either made stupidly rare, or made impossible to craft without shelling out money from your own pocket to do so. Not to mention the fact that, if you want to get at those materials, you need to improve your loadout. Which requires, you guessed it, better weapons, better Warframes, better everything. Sure, you can mod the living crap out of that sweet 2-shot rifle you got, but it's not going to do anything after a certain point, as the enemies will likely be too strong for your weapon to damage significantly, even with the right mods attached. And, even if you DID have a better weapon on hand, you would still need to grind for those ranks. Wanna know something else? You only have a HANDFUL of weapon and Warframe slots in your arsenal. If you want more slots (which you DO want), you'll have to shell out Platinum for those slots, which requires money. To give you an idea as to how much you'd be spending on slots, 12 Platinum buys 2 slots. Out of the 75 you get from the five buck Plat Pack, you're spending a little less than a dollar. For inventroy space.  And, yes, you can get Platinum from other players. Trade people items they're looking for, like Blueprints, Prime Weapon parts, etc., and you'll have a little Platinum to spend. That's if, of course, you can find a buyer for your items.  I went into this came months back looking for a good game. I thought I had found it. Cyberninjas in space, ridiculous acrobatics combined with guns and blades (bows, too), and a bunch of factions that seem very interesting, with a lot of lore to keep any lorebuff happy for a while. I left it not only disappointed, but with a very bitter taste in my mouth. The grind went from somewhat acceptable to god-awful, the items NEEDED in order to get anywhere are either too difficult for many players to get at, or cost REAL WORLD CASH to get the blueprint for, that way you can completely bypass grinding for hours on end, just hoping to get that ONE. STINKING. NEURAL. SENSOR.  Call me a noob, a loser, a whiner, or whatever it is you high-rnked people call lower-level 'plebs'. It still doesn't mean that the points I brought up are not valid reasons to not play this game. Those points being:  -The grind can often take hours, even days, to give you that one items you're looking for, especially if it is overly rare.  -Items that are locked behind a level-wall that you can't get past, even with team mates, are locked behind a paywall. Just as an example: 1 Neural Sensor, which is needed for the Rhino Warframe's Systems, is 100 Platinum. You can get 75 for FIVE BUCKS. You're paying for that and then some in order to get a part that is needed at least once or twice in EVERY Warframe, which can hold back players unable to get to the planets with the resources needed, and can hold back those who do not have the extra cash to throw out.  -RNG has made things so difficult to get your hands on, that it sometimes takes hours to get that one thing you need. Blueprints, Kubrow Eggs, rare resources, it covers it all.  -Inventroy space, which is a COMMON and AVAILABLE thing in most other MMO's, requires actual money or more grinding in order to get. And, considering that there are SEVERAL types of inventory slots, the costs add up quickly.  -The devs. Seriously, look through some of the Vets' reviews, and you'll get a pretty good idea as to what sort of BS goes on.  I've stated my opinion on the game. Others have as well. Take all of that into consideration before you begin downloading this game, or consider spend a hundred bucks on this game. Just because a game LOOKS good, and PLAYS good, does not mean that it IS good.",

You can choose between a lot of Warframes aka combat suit (not like a military suit but more like an alien suit), which gives you super powers like electical abilities.  The graphics are also worth mentioning. This game has verry good looks, and that for a free to play game. The character design is very good to, all the warframes (over 20) have very nice design.  Also this game is being updated nice and frequently, you almost get never bored in this game because of that. The updates are almost always nice and renewing updates together with bug fixes.  The one thing I don't really like about this game is that you don't get a lot of lore (I like reading the lore of a game and play lore wise). In this game I only know the lore of one warframe, and it is not that extensive.  As I said this is a really nice game at least worth checking it out, it is free so why not. I don't like the lack of lore but it is ballanced out with the nice content, and I think the lore will develop eventually. for a free to play game it is a verry beutiful and good game.",

The thing I hate most is the game almost wants you to spend platnuim all the time like for warframe slots, but I get it, the developers need to make money.   Pros: -A few fun quests -Fun missions -unique gameplay -player interaction -Fun to play with friends -Intresting story  Cons: -Lotus always saying there is a slim chance of beating mobile defense missions -Controls that can be easy to get use but are very confusing at first -almost everything costs platnuim -Game can be filled with bugs after major updates -You can still go through elevator roofs. 1/3/2017  So in conclusion this game can be pretty annoying and extremely fun at the same time. But it has all changed when the newer updated attacked  The game developers are just trying to drain you of all your hard earned cash they no longer care about what content they are providing for their players and that makes me triggered. This game is also a huge pay to win in my opinion.",

It takes a special kind of game to achieve this for me, and this game is that kind of special. The game play is smooth and rewarding, the graphics are pretty decent, and online is smooth and easy. Truely a 5 star game. I've logged hundred of hours into Warframe, and I plan to log hundreds more. For the reasonable price of free, don't pass it up. I would pay $59.99 anyday for it!",

My Only Issues.  1. being new to the game '7 days in' i can't under stand what the ♥♥♥♥ anyone else is saying when recruiting and tradeing since i have yet to learn this code like many other mmo's.  2. I want akimbo pistols, here is the process to obtain them, grind like crazy for petty cash to afford these new guns, Done?, you have 2 of them now surely you can just use them as is. NOPE, gotta pay for the blueprints for AK 'AK = akimbo and every dual pistols begins with AK etc AKLeto AKLex compared to Leto - Lex etc etc', and continueing on once you have bought it, you need some weird and completly obsolete crafting components, and some more cash to begin construction, and the build time is a mere 12 hours.  3. Steps to dual wielding in real life, step 1, get 2 of the same gun, step 2, hold one in each hand. Done!.  4. This doesn't bother my overly much but aiming is a really hard conquest, not because i suck in general, im just not used to third person aiming over the shoulder.  5. ♥♥♥♥ third person aiming!.  6. Really really grindy.  Apart from those its a great game though you would want some friends who play it as well and form squads for the harder missions and or tradeing, its got great gameplay and parkour melee gunplay combat in it whice is really unique as well as some pretty cool parkour combat moves and sweet combos.  9/10 Great Game!... ♥♥♥♥ third person aiming!.",

Also perhaps one of the most important features. It's a constantly evolving game, new missions and interesting additions are being added in -monthly- giving this amazing game a ever-changing face and the fact you'll be supported by three additional 'Tenno' Three other players all working towards the same goal, means the missions the people and the very game itself is ever changing depending on the people you join with! ... It also has some interesting end-game content that relies far more on teamwork and less on pure shooting and running off on your own this can make it it even more complex and interesting later game. So remember folks, Gun or Blade are not a Tenno's best friend, trust in your Warframe. But even more. Trust in your allies..   'I am the lotus, I will guide you but we must hurry.

Now several updates later, It has improved and grew. Heh, I didn't know it was possible to be better than Perfect.  Warframe is the best game of 2013 for me. I started out as the only person to play Warframe and I now influenced over 10 now dedicated players. (sounds small but that's like half of my friend's list -3-). The game has complete character and weapon customization. Every Warframe suits different types of gameplay and its up to you which one that is. You can find whatever weapons please you, and upgrade those weapons uniquely through mods. Even the color schemes can be altered to your cup of tea. And nothing in this game is Buy-to-win. Everything can be crafted and built for an equal gameplay for everyone.  Warframe has randomly generated maps for every mission for replayability. No two missions are the same. And this game is designed for Co-op, not Pvp. So its a game to make friends, not eniemies. And Digital extremes is constantly having in-game events and new items for a better game. And lastely, the graphics are amazing. I personally have a great computer and it's like seeing a work of art just for the loading screens. This game is beautiful, and you arent restricted to the graphics so you can numb it down if needed to remove lag.  Warframe is Amazing. I don't know why you haven't downloaded it yet. Its free!",

Yes - the game itself is smooth and simple, but the menu and interface is sluggish and a huge mess to understand anything about it.  -THE WORST ASPECT- it is pay-to-win. Understand this - any stat advantage, even time advantage you can buy with real money IS pay-to-win, only cosmetics are an exception, period. Yes, devs need to make money, but I would much rather prefer this game to be pay-to-play where everyone got equal opportunities, because, you know - I don't really like playing co-op with some paying user who rushes through and takes all kills / loot, and now I won't even comment about PvP!  -And it goes further - not just weapons, Warframes (classes) and real skins, even COLOURS for default skin are unlocked by real money, you get like one of each colour, like one red, one green, one blue, etc. but to get other TONES of the same colours, pay up!!! I was perplexed by such insolence, like - seriously??? Even if you find all ingredients to craft a weapon - it takes 24 HOURS to complete, but surprise surprise, you can hasten it by paying real money! Honestly - this game seems to be asking real money for ANYTHING, it is designed to make non-paying user experience as long and difficult as possible! Also the 'free-to-play' (or rather free to install) aspect means that the general chat is infested with the basic online obscenities, thus disabling chat becomes one of the first things to do.  -Even the good visual aspect of the game falls short - there are the same maps / themes recycled in different planets, like the snowy map in Venus, which doesn't make sense at all even for a fantasy game... and the cliché, uninspired techno-labyrinth theme which is the most common seriously gets boring after a while!    I am putting 'Recommended' only because the gameplay smoothness and graphics are stellar for a free-to-play game, you got nothing to lose to try it and most likely you will enjoy it, at least at the beginning, but investing yourself deeply in this game I do NOT recommend. Quick fun is what it is, but forget about any fair PvP and expect that your long-hard grinded gear will be nothing special, as anyone who is ready to pay will get it instantly.",

Since the SotR update, this game has suffered severe pacing issues. While introducing a interesting new Star Map, it has successfully gated content more harshly behind a silly 'Relic' system and made character progression repetitive and uninteresting.  While I'm sure future updates can lend to more interesting story telling in regards to its (alibet thin) overarching plot, this developer's business model is killing this game. Gating content while imposing a strict Pay-to-Win model of accessing basic items and weapons for progression (that later turn out to be wasted investments when used in missions), makes Warframe a terrible waste of time and money.",

Its starting to get a point where there is a grind just to get the the actual gear grind, which then requires some new resource that can only be collected or awarded in some awkwardly arbitrary way (like random alert mission rewards). Its just getting a bit silly, and obvious to most that its to purposefully extend the grind time in order to encourage people to drop real cash instead.

Archwing, iritating waste of time, sounded cool but was complete let down on release. Random downs (feel random when you dont see what did it). Speed runners who want the level over faster than its started (partly due to the grinding system). Overloading spy missions on alerts etc, iv met no one who even likes them. Removal of towers, no getting a group and working the void together for the prime parts. Making it to complicated for new players and veterans. System specs, the minimum pc specs are not worth reading anymore, long forgoten. The lack of enemys to start with, now theres too many, e.g walking into a small room with 5 high level bombards and 2 heavys (not fun at all). This problem has gotten worse, like it doesnt know when to stop spawning. New navigation system, looks pretty but slower to navigate. After update 15 the game started its downward spiral, latest update killed it.  There are more negatives but the biggest is the feel the game had, vanished. Just dont bother with this , not worth it.

Some of the changes are very sloppy leaving frames like nova (name would sugest supernova right) being unrecognisable from there name. Frost, Rhino, Banshee, Mesa, Trinity and Nova all either need work or have been worked on too much making there descriptions in game and expectations based on name not match up at all.

Grinding orokin runs in the void the RNG is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, running a mission 40 times to get a lex prime part and still not getting is is rediculous.. According to devs working as intended.. I guess if they want me to spend money and time elsewhere, then yeah it's working as intended.. I could go on and on.. it's a good game, but they need to make some reasonable changes, like a loot selector after so many runs, a real functional difference (think old frost, or Ember, in theory Trinity), Frames should matter more than guns, but fact is they just done.. it's a good game.. needs some love..

The game is beautiful, with a sleek and clean space-age aesthetic that is a lot of eye candy. There really is a Warframe for everyone, with a variety of looks, feels, builds and abilities that are as fun as they are variable. There's still a lot of small glitches here and there (not being able to see the color of another player's ship is a current one) but nothing that impacts real gameplay, so that is truly a nit-pick more then a criticism.

Ok don't get me wrong, you can get EVERYTHING a paid user can get with literally no exceptions thanks to the trading system. You can trade paid currency and many in game item blueprints and mods as you like. This allows free to play users to earn paid currency.  However if you're going this route expect to farm 24/7 for the rest of your life. I'm one of the Founders of this game and i own the highest prime access pack which give the highest value for money paid currency. Yet i still haven't managed to 100% this over all my hours of playtime.   Good News Though, unless you're a crazy collector like me, you'll never have to. You can easily get proper gear you like within a week or two of playing.  I cannot stress enough how much care and love was put into this game, the updates are more frequent than i'v seen in any game ever. Adding a bunch of new maps,warframes,guns,cosmetics and a ton of other stuff. It is the most space ninja game you're gonna get with an ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing ton of content.   I recommend this game to it's fullest! It has it's flaws obviously... it can be pretty buggy at times but that's to be expected with constant updates, thankfully the bugs are dealt with rapidly but new ones will still come around. It is pretty grindy in it's nature and there are timewalls on crafting but they are no problem whatsoever once you have sated your lust for your first gear.  What i do not recommend however is buying weapons or warframes directly from the in game store, the prices are really high and they're that way on purpose. You're really intended to craft them, that's how i got 95% of my gear. However if you are into costumizing your looks, well you're in luck. The prices for cosmetics in this game are very resonable and with the daily chance to get a 25% , 50% or 75% discount on the paid currency you can end up with a ton for dirt cheap.  Warframe..

As far as FTP goes, it's one of the best out there.  Plus, it's based in the Dark Sector universe. Which is freaking awesome.  (I know they've never officially confirmed it, but come on. Even if it's not based in the exact universe, there are so many nods towards their older game that it's rediculous.)  If you're looking for a free game to play, give it a try. It can be played without paying any money pretty easily. It just takes longer to do anything. Plus if you supplement this game with a little cash every once in a while, it's very enjoyable.",

I was with my kubrow and when the Grinner appeared, Terry (My Kubrow) started growling. As I turned my head, one Grinner lancer aimed his karak at me. He fired twice and pirced my arm and torso. As I fell I could see a lancer pull out his cleaver and buther Terry, He was wimpering. One more slice to the head and Terry went down. I can still see his body. I screamed at the top of my lungs, more lancers appeared, but I did not care. Terry, my wonderful Terry was gone. I whiped out my Lato and shot at the lancers as I screamed at the top of my lungs. Then they came. An explosion rocked the platform, and I fell. I was falling, Down, down, down. The wings wraped around me and healed me. it gave me life, it gave me air. It was a Tenno. Untill then I was a Tenno denier. They were fake, legends of the empire, of the Orokin. But here it was, in front of me. After that I lost focus and blacked-out.  I woke, I was in a temple with Tenno suronding me. There was a pool with a silver liquid. I understood my fate. I jumped into the pool. The liqud clung to my skin, it created an armor. a warframe. I step out of the pool. The Tenno bowed and chanted. I was reborn. I was a Tenno. I found the Lancer captin that killed Terry. His name, was captin Vor As I rushed into battle, I screamed 'FOR TERRY!'  Come Tenno, you must join the war.",

For a free to play game it has great graphics, great gameplay, a good variety of things to do and an absolute ton of optional progression available.  At the start, options can be a liitle limited and the game doesn't direct new players that well, but if you stick with it you will be greatly rewarded.  To start with you only have 3 warframes to choose from and once chosen you are locked to that frame and the weapons you selected. And at first, when you look to see what other gear you can get, you would be forgiven for thinking it is a pay to win game, due to all the gear that (at first glance) can only be bought by platinum (which can only be bought with real money). However, after playing for a while I found that you can in fact unlock all frames and weapons ingame, by finding or buying (with ingame credits) blueprints, then crafting them with components you find on missions and drops, etc. There are some cosmetic items that can only be acquired via platinum, but nothing in terms of functional gear. Platinum merely removes the process of finding, crafting, and to some degree upgrading, the items you want.  It has, in my opinion, a perfect cash shop system. While the progression can be slow, the game is so much fun to play it doesn't feel grindy. The combat is great, the parkour movement system is a lot of fun and there is a large variety of weapon and frame options to choose from, which you can swap around between missions. There is a good selection of mission types available and each mission tileset is randomized.  I have not tried the PvP side of things in this game yet, so I do not know how balanced it is (some frames can get crazy powerful), but the PvE side of things is great fun, both solo and with allies.  The polish in Warframe is excellent and I really like the organic artstyle the game has. It is a game that will appeal to both casual and hardcore players alike, and that is no mean feat. And on top of that the devs clearly have a lot of passion for their game, and do regular patch and content updates.  Warframe is my join most played game currently, along with Guild Wars 2 and Fallout 4, and I can see myself continuing to play it for a long time to come.  Because the devs are clearly doing their best to improve and add to the game, and because the gameplay, aesthetics, variety and progression are all top notch, I am happy to rate this game 10 out of 10, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fast paced scifi action games. And who wouldn't enjoy playing as a badass space ninja?",

I've been playing for over 500 hours (played before I added it to steam), and have enjoyed every hour of it. I got to see the amazing growth of this game from its basic UI and launcher, to a now more sophisticated experiance. Make no mistake, this game is really easy to understand, now more than ever since they updated the tutorial. (Again I witnessed the first tutorial and am loving the changes its gone through). Before, the UI was very limited and cubic. Now you have your own ship, or liset, that is custom to your preference. They added new companions known as Kubrows. Before you had small robots who followed you around doing their own abilites to help you. However, dont think people still dont use them. They are just as used as the dogs are. As for the actual Warframes, you can't complain. They have made over a dozen warframes to choose from. Those who like tanking(like me) choose Rhino or Frost. DPS? Ember. Healing? Trinity. Each have their own unique abilities to suit every kind of player out there. There is a large disccusion still going on on the fact that Warframe has been known to being a Pay 2 Play. I'm here to say that that is not true. Yes, Platinum (Purchased currency) has its obvious advantages, but not many. In fact, you can get anything you want in-game, even if it does cost Plat. How you ask? The magic of trading. Your eventually going to get stuff others want, and they'll pay you Plat for it. And if you don't feel like waiting, farm it. Most farming in-game can actually be a lot of fun, especially if your with a friend. And for those of you who are worried about loot drops being for only one person of your team, don't worry, all loot can be picked up by everyone.(So WoW fans you can calm down). In conclusion I give this game a 10/10. But don't take my word for it, go try it yourself.",

First off, lemme just say that this game, for being free, is really well optimized at least for my and my friend's rigs. The graphics overall as well are REALLY nice especially being a free game. I know that there are some other free games that have amazing graphics but this one (atleast for me) takes the cake. Now there have been some graphical glitches I've ran into but they're usually pretty minor. Speaking of glitches, this game MOST DEFINITLY has its fair share lemme tell ya. However, most of them usually get patched out the next hotfix so it's not that bad. There are also some hilarious ones so thats always a good laugh. As far as gameplay goes, this game wins it for me as well. The time and care that DE puts into each frame is amazing. Each frame is unique, has its own style and abilities. Even further from that the amount of weapons added into this mix makes it that much better. Then when you add in the mods, it makes the list of customization and amount of playstyles so much longer.  Now for the few cons: Platinum. Need I say more? Well actually, I don't really have an issue with plat it's just expensive and I'm poor (from buying plat fml) Only reason I'm okay with it is because it supports the constant updates (and by constant I mean almost weekly).  Wait time. Theres a lot of it. Just get ready to wait for stuff you want. On average it takes most weapons 12-24 hours to make, warframe parts take 12 and the warframe takes a whopping 73 hours to craft. It's not bad persay but I still find it annoying even if it is to balence the game.   Other than this I cant really think of any other personal complaints I have with the game, really. Overall I would highly recommend this game to someone that likes PvE with some PvP games (sorta like Destiny I guess?) It's really a great game to sit down witha few friends and play the hell outta for an hour or two.   See you in combat, Tenno",

Why?  1) Everything you earn in this game can be earned for FREE. As long as you have the time. If you feel like rushing an item in forge, etc. etc., you can ourchase credits to get that item on the spot. So spending money is completely optional. (Plus, the grind to get items leaves a much more satisfying taste once you finally get said item.)   2) Warframe is updated daily. Always a good thing. The more the merrier.  3) Gameplay is SOLID. Movements in this game are nice and crisp. I'm always doing some wild maneuvers that make me feel like a badass. Quality is a plus, especially for a free to play.  The only con I have is that I encountered a bug where I could not see anything on my screen but my game was still running. So I had to find the exit button to close the game. But after that, everything worked fine. Also, it is a bit hard to understand how everything works in the game at first. The game just throws you in. They have tutorials in the codex, but I don't think it's enough. However, I learned as I started to play more and research.  I highly recommend this game to anybody who wants to have fun.

While micro-transactions do play a part in this game, it is entirely co-op, not competetive, so you aren't going to get wiped on the floor by someone because they shelled out some cash for goodies, because they will always be on YOUR team. And every equipable item in the marketplace that can be bought with premium cash can be crafted using blueprints, which you can buy in the marketplace for in-game credits. There are even some items only available through finding the blueprints for them in missions. All in all, Warframe is an amazing co-op experience, and while the game is technically still in beta and has a few bugs and glitches here and there, the developers are always on top of the situation, and regularly converse with members on the forums to weed them out. I would definitely reccomend a quick download of this game right away. After all, NINJAS PLAY FREE!!! :D",

On a more serious note, I have played this back in Update 9 (Crrently in U17) and left becasue none of my friends would play it and I was rather lost and alone, (#LoneTenno). However, a few weeks back my friends mentioned this game and I was very excited to get people to play and BOOM,.... The game hit me like a god damn 18 wheeler in the face coming back to my old account not knowing anything or what to do at all!!! (Ahhh the joys of being a newb....). So I did whAT ANY SANE PERSON WOULD DO... START FROM SCRATCH AND i HAVE BEEN HAVING A BLAST!  SSERIOUSLY TRY THIS GAME! 10/10  F2P ASPECT: Asthetics- Cash out the Dough - (However some holidays they offer free asthetics like facial hair and colo palettes)  Weapons - Farm/Cash out the dough - (Honestly just farm it out the flow of the game makes it fun as you grind away)  Characters (AKA Warframes)- Farm/Cash out the dough (Farm yet again.... unless its a Warframe that is nearly impossible to get, *cough* Ash *Cough*)  Rare Items - Farm/cash out the dough (again just farm, you never know, maybe while farming for the other materials you will get the item you want)  Lives - Cash out the dough/ DONT DIE/ wait for reload/ change warframe -   So in a day, your character has four live and once they are up you cannot revive anymore, so if you are in a mission and die, you are forced to abort. BUT revives are on a per Warframe basis so if you have 2 Warframes each 'frame has 4 lives.  Now for the worst part of the entire F2P model  INVENTORY SLOTS FOR WEAPONS AND WARFRAMES  ok, so slots cost 20 platinum (($1.33 USD) premium currency, must pay or trade to get).  Each slot can hold 1 weapon and same goes for the warframe slots.   HOWEVER DESPITE ALL THIS CASHING OUT THE DOUGH....You can FARM 4 PLATINUM!!!!!!  Platinum (Plat.) is the premium currency within warframe but its not excludded form the Warframe economy. SO a player may farm to get rare parts or mods to sell for platinum to wallet warriors within the community!.  there is alot more to go over but......I think this enough for a new player to learn anymore and it might be too much info to read soooo JUST PLAY THE GAME ALREADY!!!!!!!

The combat feel's great, the diversity in weapons/suits is awesome and each tends to feel different to use, especially in the case of Warframes. The nature of the game always gives you something to do without feeling like you're being punished for playing F2P if that's your scenario, it's really a pay for convinence rather then pay to win in any scenario. The only thing locked behind a pay wall is cosmetic stuff and even then you can trade in game for platinum (The purchasable resource) off other players in the late stages of the game.   The game is easy to pick up and play and looks and feels like the sci-fi game I always wanted. I honestly think this is one of the best free to play titles I've had the pleasure of sinking some time into. That said while you can easily sink tons of hours at a time into this game I would very much recommend that you don't burn it out too quickly, the content is not limitless in nature. While at end game there is always something to keep you occupied if you wish it, burning through the available missions in a few weeks is not advised in my opinion.

            "review_text": "(This will most likely be my most comprehensive review yet.)  Warframe is a complicated game. I've been giving this game a break for about a while or so; and I recently got back into it, today in fact. I was reminded why I ditched the game for a while now. My first match, I was supposed to hack and then protect some terminals on a quest(The New Strange, Eris.). I failed due to the position being compromised. I decided afterwards, why not level up my cute kubrow(Its a dog, and they are adorable.)? He was incubating. In other words, I'd have to wait a few real-world days to use him. I decided after that, why not level up m new gun, Karak Wraith? I went into Apolladorus, Mercury, and I had a glitch where the camera was in my character. I couldn't properly see anything, so I had to quit fairly on, only reason I survived as long as I did was because my shots could instant kill the low level enemies.   Originally, I loved Warframe. (Just look at my play-time!) But now, the gameplay feels stale, I've slaughtered everything, I've cut down every faction, I've done the quests, participated in events, so many things.   But whats to do when you've done everything?  If you want to play a relatively fun MMO, give Warframe a chance. Just don't play it to death.  EDIT: 7/11/2015  Yeesh, that review was terrible. I'll keep it there to remind your fine self as well as myself that this game can indeed get old; but any game can get old. Using a game getting repetative is a terrible point in a review(Unless the game gets old very quickly; in which case its justified.).   Warframe does not fit that criteria. It took me hundreds of hours to get bored; and those hours were magical. I made friends, made a clan, made enemies, freed the solar system from its oppressors, slew a race of assimilating hive mind controlled monsters, blew up giant robots managed by a corrupt CEO and board, and impaired a xenophobic army. I uncovered mysteries long thought lost, revitalized a warframe long thought lost. I even flew through space on a jetpack and shot down massive ships with my bros and avenged our fallen comrades who were struck down by those same ships.   I love this game. No amount of burn out or boredom will keep me from loving it. Why? Well, besides the the memories mentioned above, i've never seen a developer who loved their creation so much; this game receives content updates far more often; Update 17 is right around the corner, and I am pumped for that.   Only thing I should suggest ahead is it'd be ideal(Not a requirement) to bring a friend in with you, but thats an MMO thing. EDIT 2: 3/13/2016  Just finished the Second Dream questline. Yup. This game is the best MMO i've ever played. EDIT 3: 6/7/2016   Its been a while and Digital Extremes has pumped out quite a few new bits fo content, but fans still eagerly await the next massive update. The pressure, it seems, was too much for Digital Extremes. In their plight to please fans, they have created quite the community controversy. Namel, by nerfing characters. Mirage and Exacaliber, who both previously had some of the best ultimates in the game, now have had their ults nerfed in the form of lowering Exlated Blade's damage, its distance, and giving it damage falloff(It loses damage over the distance it travels.), Mirage now can only confine her ultimate to her line sight(It used to clear out rooms and made raids slightly less likely to end in people bashing their skulls into their keyboards.), which makes her ult completely pointless as now Mirage will have to brazenly rush into enemy fire, and probably die since she's caster frame, just to fire off her ult. Next we have the healer, Trinity, who's ult was making friendlies all over the map become invinicble for a bit. Now, Blessing will only work if allies are in your immediate vicinty, as in 25 meters or more. This doesn't sound bad, until you go into a T4 Survival and you're running low on oxygen, and your teams needs to split up. Your bro is with Trin, and you're with a Dead Eye Mesa, then a Corrupted Bombard and Corrupted Nullifer come in, now Blessing won't save you, now nothing will. Next, we have the fan favorite Valkyr, the beserker frame, who has the incredibly awesome ult of Hysteria, which also makes you invincible(Gee, almost makes you think DE shouldn't have gone for tons of invincible ults...) and turns you into a real beserkers as Valkyr gets epic energy claws and cuts Corpus Combat Engineers to ribbons. Now, her ult rapidly drains the more energy it goes on. Now, Valkyr's ult is great as Valkyr's highest stat is armor, not health or shields. Hysteria gave her a change to regen her shields, as well as revive allies in sticky situations while she's under fire. In addition to the cost, the moment she leaves Hysteria and there's an enemy nearby, she's screwed.  TL;DR:   These nerfs have ruined many incredibly popular frames, divided the community once again. These literally could have been fixed any day for three years now. The fact they do this now, right before a major update, just makes it worse as it seems like they're padding out the wait, and adding in an inflamation of artifical difficulty. I run this game on a toaster laptop, and I prfer to solo, usually with Trinity Prime, as I love her to death. Now unfortanately, the blessing build I used before due to her poor stats, now she can only die a lot.   Finally, sorry for the long read, but that summerize my thoughts on the latest 'Bug fix' quite well. DE has nerfed many characters that made soloing far more bearable, and totally I unistalled the game. The game is great for anyone new, but older players may find themselves at a great disadvantage with the new changes, and may wish to change their warframes.  Overall, this stays a positive as only a few frames were changed, but it still stands a probelem with Digital Extremes that they have to face this problem of seemingly random nerfs, or explain themselves accordingly. EDIT 4: 7/14/2016  Trying to keep this review up to date. Three Days ago, they released Specters of the Rail, otherwise known as 'The Fanbase splits apart for the millionth time!'This time for a slightly more legit reason: Removal of the Void and the new system, Void Fissures. Oh, and Kavats. And hopefully soon, Titania and The War Within quest. If I remember this review exists, i'll update it as I continue exploring the latest update.",

            "review_text": "TL:DR below. But honestly, read the whole thing if you consider playing for the first time.  Now me and Warframe have a bit of a 'it's complicated' relationship. So let's do the nice things first and then I'll delve into the parts I don't like in particular or that just make me want to rush the Digital Extremes team with an axe.   THE GOOD  The gameplay and the general mechanics that the game presents as it's main strength (you playing as a space ninja with superpowers) are present, delivered and executed with grace. The game is fun to play and provides quite a lot of entertainment. Moreso if you have friends to play with, since the game is based around coop for up to four players (90% of the game is still solo-able, so you can still play even if you're a person who would totally hang out with other people, but *insert excuse*) Anyways the core game is solid, the forums active and the overall community feels good. The main premise of the gameplay can be summarized like this: Step 1: Disregard enemies Step 2: Acquire currency and resources from the corpses of said enemies. Step 3:Use the aforementioned to craft a weapon Step 4: Further personalize your playstyle by further modifying the weapons in your arsenal and your warframe Step 5: Return to Step 1 Well, disregarding enemies using various weapons, be it a bow capable of tearing through multiple foes with one arrow, a shotgun obliterating your enemies, a staff, a scythe, a massive hammer, kunai, inflato-ray, handheld chainsaws, sniper rifles, claws, high-powered gloves and shoes further enhancing your punches and kicks, a katana, a dog, a flying cube or anything they might've added since I wrote this review is fun, and as you probably realized by now, you have a lot of options to choose from. So you can spend a lot of time either polishing your skills with one weapon or hoarding everything you come across and hugging your recent favorites while drooling in fetal position and chuckling softly later. The crafting system does its job and while some weapons are definitely hard to obtain, if you get to the point where you're able to get them, you probably don't mind sinking a few more hours into the game anyway.  The game has a solid lore partially influenced by the decision of the players and a history shrouded in mystery so well, we can only keep guessing about who we actually play as. The story provides good support to the gameplay and keeps me intrigued.  And mods. Oh boy.  THE MODS  Now, even though I laid before you the core gameplay I purposefully left out one feature, simply because the mods are both good AND bad. Every weapon and 'frame you come across is equipped with a number of empty mod slots. These can be filled with, you guessed it, modifications. Mods are numerous and their effects vary immensely, so the number of possible combinations to try is astronomical. BUT. Mods aren't acquired automatically or unlocked (several exceptions there, but that's like 1% of the total mod count). Mods have to be found from random drops. And given that a specific mod usually drops from a specific enemy, and that a) the chance for that is pretty low and b) the mob may be spawning in end-game levels only, it can and will frustrate some who try to just reach for that one mod they want so badly. Mods can be also improved in terms of effectivity, but that means destroying other mods to improve one, or using several 'Fusion Cores' which give considerably larger bonuses and drop randomly from fallen enemies too. This system is slightly-above-average at best and downright rage-inducing at worst. Also the aforementioned customization is also limited by the player's own (hopefully) human conscience. In short there are mods that aren't worth squat and have no reason to exist whatsoever, since the bonuses they provide can't lift a candle against others. So, instead of making the most of what you've got, you will spend hours/days chasing/fusing that one mod that will finally make your weapon usable in higher levels. There's even a mod that increases overall damage up to insane numbers, a must-have for endgame. So the mod system, while essential, is partially broken. There have been ideas on the forums on how to either rework or discard the system in favor of a new one, but I don't think that we will see any changes in the foreseeable future.  THE STUFF THAT MAKES ME GO OHMYGODWHYISTHISSTILLATHINGAFTERA♥♥♥♥♥♥♥YEAR  1) The inventory For a game with so much custom-loadoutization, Warframe makes one very profitable (for them) and very infuriating (for you) choice. Adding an inventory system. Basically, you have (as of now) about 30 warframes and about 180 weapons. BUT. You can only have two warframes and six weapons in your inventory at once. There are two methods of expanding your inventory-either obtaining event weapons that come with their own separate slots, or purchase aditional slots with platinum (real cash). And while platinum can be obtained by trading with players and you get some at the beginning, most of it comes from real purchases for real cash by real players.  2) The grouping and hosting This one is pretty self-explanatory. Even though the number of mission crashes has significantly reduced with the removal of strict NATs, it's still an issue that can result in wasting a lot of your time and building up enough fury to start biting your table. Example: You spend 40+ minutes surviving in the void with a new reward coming each 5 minutes. All goes well, the drops are nice. Suddenly, everything around you freezes. You are now trapped inside you own private world, empty and lifeless, while your friends are overwhelmed and decide to finish the mission. When they leave, your mission crashes and all the rewards, experience, mods and so on are GONE. NO REFUNDS. And while you can submit a report, nobody will give you back those minutes you spent to earn absolutely nothing.   THE GRAND FINALE  Now while Warframe definitely has its issues, it is first and foremost a free game. And with 260.8+ hours under my belt I would be lying if I said that the game isn't entertaining enough to make me return to it ever so often. And that's why I recommend it, even though the rant above might turn away some of you. I recommend, because you can squeeze a great amount of fun out of this without spending a single penny. There's a reason why the game has such strong playerbase. It is definitely worth at least a try. And if you don't like it, you can always come back later to observe the changes.  TL:DR It's fine. Give it a go. And maybe three more gos after the first one. Seriously, play this.",

Now before I get all touchy and such, lemme get to the quick pros and cons.  PROS: +F2P that isn't a P2W at all, almost everything can be obtained through effort +Amazing graphics and mostly consistent animations +Gameplay is extremely immersive +Customizability is extreme. Almost every personal detail can be modified to your personal tastes, with the only restriction being the models themselves. +Lore is fascinating, deep, and above all hits us to the personal level +Did I mention it's F2P already? Yes? Well, won't hurt to say it again.  CONS: - The amount of grinding in this game is what puts off many possible players from trying it out. Personally, I love it because of how the grinding in here reminds me of the Monster Hunter franchise. However, also like Monster Hunter, the process of collecting resources is very tedious and at often times unsatisfying. - Graphics overload. Going back to my comment about the Graphics being a PRO, with all the high end graphics comes with an often grievous cost. For lower end computers, like mine, the graphics are consistently a problem that can lead to crashes and, at worst cast scenarios, blue screens. -Repetitiveness. Like Monster Hunter, at certain times, the game can often have a feel of repetitiveness. In many missions and/or situations, fighting the same enemies in the same environments using the same methods can feel a bit boring to an extent. This issue is resolved very quickly. however, with new additions of weapons and the updates that are very frequent. ",

Wondering if my Soma Prime BP is actually so rare. Would definately recommend this game at this stage.  50 hour mark - Turns out my blueprint for Soma Prime isn't rare. Found a couple of friendly OP players in a defense mission on Jupiter. One thing led to another and I found out what Taxi means. They helped me unlock 3 planets. Feeling pretty good. Also the first time I need Platinum ( Ingame currency) for weapon slots. I guess microtransactions is needed Im not arguing. Im starting to understanding that using the right mods is very important in this game.  100 hour mark - First of all. I rarely get more than 100 hours on any game. At this point of the game I have found myself a clan with a lot of rare and usefull blueprints which I can just buy. Right now I am Mastery Rank 6. I have finished all the planets bosses and have farmed 6 warframes which is finished and ready to play with. One of these includes Saryn which alone took about 7-10 hours. I have all the planets except 1. The last one. Eris. The boss that unlocks Eris is an Archwing mission and to be honest I do not want to even try to complete it. The farming that is needed is tremendous. After I complete the last boss and have all the planets. Whats left? Will this game become a farming simulator?",

            "review_text": "As far as free games go, this is a fantastic game. This game has a fantastic environment, great gameplay and beautiful look. I like how you're not really 'forced' into buying any cash items at all, almost everything is available in-game through farming. There is fantastic customisations on virtually everything you obtain. The dojo (guild hall) is great, and very fun to decorate (although the interface needs to be improved for that).  I do have some 'pet-peaves' with this game though...  Firstly, I hate how gear-oriented this game is! The mob armor scaling at higher levels is rediculous! I found that even when doing basic map completion (star chart nodes/quests) that my character was extremely squishy against mobs that took little damage from me while 1-shotting me! This mean taking time away to grind out some better weapons and mods just to continue.  Secondly, the reward to effort ratio is completely unfair! I'm doing missions where I'm barely able to survive, struggle for a while, often dying a few times just to come away with 2000 credits and I need like 100k for something. Come on!  Thirdly, dead squads. The game has been out a while, so nobody is doing star chart any more. Unless there's an alart or something, you can forget anyone grouping with you. And no thanks, I don't want to try solo an Interception mission.  Fourth, pressing 'X' and ending up sky high somewhere because there was a trip-wire NOWHERE near you! Everyone who's played Warframe, will know exactly what I'm talking about here lol.  Fifth, having to stand with you shoulders perfectly squared to a locker to open it. OMG this one really bugs me!! I run through maps as fast as I can, and I see lockers, I walk up to them spamming 'X' to open then quickly. Nothing happens, you have to stand 100% perfectly in front of the darn thing JUST to open it, come on!  Lastly, you should rename this game to 'Farmframe' or 'Grindframe'. Sure, every game has RnG etc, but this one takes grinding to a whole other level. I hate grinding in games, it's not fun at all. Who wants to spend hours upon hours just to get a single item, then have to repeat that task another 10 times for the other items you need?! We're not all no-life 100% game time people without a social life or job. I think loots should be more attainable. Not through cash shop, but through improved squads/grouping.  To conclude, despite these so-called 'pet peaves' of mine, this game is fantastic fun! Please don't let me personal opinions put you off this great game! I would still highly recommend it to you.",

            "review_text": "Okay, so this will be a long review, you ready? Got your popcorn? No? WELL TOO BAD IM STARTING ANYWAY.   So you start out with the Lotus, a lady who tells you to run and use your first ability, in my case, slash and dash, to kill your enemies. Around a minute later, You're given a choice. I believe its MK1 Bo staff or MK1 Skana. I chose skana personally. After killing more enemies, your given another choice. MK1 Kunai, or MK1 i forgot what it is, I chose kunai. Then your given your final choice for the mission, Primary weapon. I believe its MK1 Braton or MK1 Paris. paris being a bow and braton being a machine gun. I chose paris. So, in this game, you can rush through the entire level, do it however fast you want to, or you can stay, get loot, get mods, and really customize to your playstyle. Personally, i like stealth. So i eventually got the warframe Loki, whose abilities are, Decoy, Invisibility, Decoy explosion, and Radial disarm. There are many warframes, a new one being recently introduced, Atlas, who can read minds i believe. Now, to the point, this game is an absolute grindfest. Everone calls it P2W because of high platinuim *The premium currency* prices. Thats to put up a grindwall. They dont want you taking the easy way out.There are people with 3000+ Hours in this game that are barely halfway through getting a prime warframe. So, you may be thinking, 'How duz me get muteeruels fur diss' Thats how you all sound obviously, but you can purchase blueprints in the market for credits, the money earned ingame. Platinuim is used to buy the component itself. Say you wanted a dual skana blueprint or something, you would need X amount of resources, that you get from each planet. Each planet gives its own resources, like earth, has rubedo, and mars, has something else. Anyway, onto the main factions in the game. The five main factions so far are the Grineer, the Corpus, the infected, the Orokin, and the Tenno, you are the tenno, You are the operator, ordis- sorry i got lost there. But you have this dude in your ship named ordis. Every so often he'll say funny things, like 'Oh dear! The operator has come back with an archwing part! You must forge it immediately, Soon you'll be flying through the skies like a *Voice gets much deeper* WINGED DEATH MACHINE'. Anyway back to the factions, The orokin are the more advanced faction.They have these things called death cubes there, that shoot lasers that kill both them and you extremely fast, making it very useful. The grineer are the starters, Fairly easy. Nothing special about them. The corpus hold a lot of loot, and have tougher enemies. Like MOAs, for instance. These are robotic chicken like guys with machine guns. Onto the Infected, A failed lab experiment of the grineer, the infected are now insanely powerful, being leapers, chargers, and ancients. Ancients can grab you and pull you along with them, which is scary stuff. Onto the gamemodes, Ill only be listing 3 to save time, but theres the exterminate, where you kill everything on the ship, the survival, your air supply is cut off and you have to run around and get capsules to stay alive, whilst being shot, and defense, where you defend a certain item/artifact. Actually, theres 2 more I wanted to list, the crossfire, where you board a ship full of fighting grineer and corpus, and kill them all. I dont remember what the last one is called, but you take the side of a faction, like corpus, and they become teammates as you clear out infected or grineer. Thats all for now, updates WILL be coming, this game is still developing, fast, and insanely fun, this game is a Ninja grindfest with a lot to do.",

All the maps are procedurally generated, the rooms are the same, but arranged completely different every time, and the map could be long one play through, and short the next, on top of all that, every planet in the system has its own environment type, so you'll come across many interesting landscapes, and every playthourgh of a mission, there's a chance of there being a different penalty, for example, if there is ice in the level, it will reduce your maximum shields, and sometimes there'll be fire, making the terrain hazardous.. Every piece of equipment, including your warframe, has its own level, and your account does too. There are several different warframes/classes for you to find and build, and one of them is bound to suit your playstyle, not to mention a large arsenal of weapons to choose from, but you must earn the credits to unlock these. Eventually, if you get enough credits, you can buy a Sentinel, a small floating robot that'll hover over your shoulder, and support you any way you have it configured. Also, every piece of equipment has specific mods that will work for it, such as damage types, fire, ice, shock, armor piercing, rate of fire, reload time, and many more,, you can also level every mod up to a certain limit to increase its potential. There is an extensive crafting system, you find certain materisl in each system, and you use these to complete blueprints you've found or bought with credits, in order to create new gear, or even warframes. If you get really good, you can run along walls, and keep jumping to other surfaces, to speed your self up far more than a regular run would. It takes some decent aim to to a good job, and good reflexes, so come on and give this game a try, it is very fun indeed.",

Also you can drop a lot of money in the game if you get into it because of different customization for warframs and sentinels. You can also buy weapons with your plat but for the player that just wants have a fun game with not droping a dime there is goos news for you. almost everything you see in the store you can build in game with no real money charges it just takes longer to obtain that item.

The developers are churning out a decent amount of new content on a regular basis, which is nice considering more f2p games dont get as much attention.   Once you get the blueprints needed for new gear, finding materials to craft it can be a bit of a bother. Once you find the materials, you have to wait hours and sometimes days to craft the item you want. Real time. That really kills the momentum of the game when youre forced to wait so long to continue playing with the items you want. Of course, if you can afford the incredibly expensive platinum currency, waiting wont be an issue. They have to make money somehow, right?  The only other negative I can think of is the melee combat. For a game based around it being known as 'Mass Effect Online with Swords', it doesnt have much going for the melee. Attacks can sometimes be difficult to land in rapid succession, and the damage done doesnt warrant using anything besides jumping and charged attacks.  Everything besides that is great. Graphics, sound, controls, everything is appealing and easy to pick up. Definitely one of the best free-to-play games I've ever enjoyed.",

You wake up from a pod to find that there is a massive galactic war between two factions; Corpus and Grineer. You fight your war through to survive forging your own path to either fight to unite the surviving Tenno and be the war monger species that kept the universe under control with ancient technology known as Warframes or to fight only for the riches. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Character Design-  The characters you play are soundless agile ninja that you get almost full customization of. You re guided by a burden navigator known as 'Lotus' She is used to guide you and warn you of oncoming danger in game, however, like all Navi talk through, they are just annoying. Bosses can be exceedingly hard and there is a good amount of enemy variation between the Corpus, Grinneers, and Infested. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound &amp; Artwork-  The music is enemy triggered and it is seemly soundless when you're not being hunted down or in fire fights. There is barely any musical style to the game. Sounds are basic with Armor clashing against blade and bullets burrowing through flesh into bone. You can hear a good lot of the damage you inflict. Visually the game is gorgeous, even on the lowest settings the environment and characters always look shockingly great. A thing to note down is the blur effects that can happen when in huge skirmishes. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gameplay-  With all the cons of the style of the game this is where it takes my heart. The gameplay is amazing, with a ton of map variation that is not the same a good portion of time, the hack and slash feel mixed with strategic gun play and puzzles. It makes me feel like I am playing Ninja Gaiden with better controls and guns. Fast passed loot fest action and incredible special abilities make for an amazing rush. there are a few bugs right now due to it being in BETA. The customization in Warframe is wide but complex when it comes to upgrading. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Conclusion-  All in all I'd have to give the game an 8.75/10 Due to all the faults it has. Even with it being in BETA. The replay value however will be 10/10 because if you like it you'll stick with it through the whole thing for awhile. I know I do. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

It's not hyperbole to say that either; the devs are constantly updating core systems to work and feel a lot better.  Not as short: You can read a summary of the game from this page or other reviews, but the concerns most folks will have are about it being F2P, and if the game is fun enough to sustain interest. WF's F2P model is summed up as a well-modeled wait-gated, mild resource farming game. Don't be scared off just yet. You can play as much as you want for free. The game doesn't limit you with tokens to play, or waiting to heal yourself. What you wait for are things like crafting times. Resource requirements for most things are pretty mild (3-5 runs of a map should get you most stuff). You can even trade other players for platinum, the game's premium currency.  Game play is a lot of fun, and if you played before and got tired of it, it might be time to try again. The melee system was revamped, missions are much more engaging now rather than mostly fetch quests, story and lore are told much better than it used to be, and the game even has a few end-game elements such as warring factions (not PvP, but rather setting up defenses for invasions). The game focuses well on PvE, even though there are some options for dueling and 2v2 sparring.  If you never played, the game has more than enough to keep you busy (and more importantly, interested). If you left a while ago, you can return now. The game has changed so much that most every system that you thought was lacking is now quite robust. The game isn't done improving yet though, and it's technically labeled a 'beta' still, but the reality is that WF will keep changing and improving, and it looks like it's all going down a good path.",

            "review_text": "The reason I tried this game is because it's constantly in the top 15 most played steam game list. I was skeptical about its popularity at first, but it was soon dissipated when I started playing.   The basics classes are warframes, each frame has three components you can collect from boss drops at the end of the boss level. It's rather fast to collect these components, no need to buy them from the real money market. In which the frames are quite expensive to buy, there is no real need for that.  Most weapons can be bought with in-game credits from the market, and built with resources gained in game. Again, no need to buy with real money. There are some end game weapons / frames that can be collected from end game content, you can't buy them in the market.  The frames and weapons are augmented with mods, which are dropped in game. They give stat changes, such as increased damage, fire rate, reload speed, health, etc.. Mods can be combined with other mods (such as duplicates to the same mod) to increase their level, which increases their potency and the cost of using the mod. The higher the level of the frame / weapon, the more mods you can augment it with.  The only things worth spending money on are frame and weapon inventory slots, which are quite cheap. Then after that, there is an item that can supercharge a frame / weapon, gives you more space for mods. Which can be obtained in game, but is quite rare. Then there are cosmetics items, which are purely optional. I got about 1800 plantinum for $25, after 20+ weapons and 4 frames, and some cosmetics, I only used up 400 plats.  The missions are randomly generated, at the end of each mission you collect in-game credits, mods, and resources. You can alternate between your primary (rifle, shotgun, sniper), secondary (pistol, throwing knives), or melee (swords, dual swords, heavy). The movement is fluid, you can wall walk, slide, slide jump, slide spin attack, leap attack, etc. It makes you feel fast and like an assassin.   After 70+ hours in game, I'd say this game is ninja with guns/swords in space, a third-person diablo-like item collection game. Although repetitive, when played in co-op, can be quite satisfying mowing down large amount of enemies.",

            "review_text": "Note: I have only played the game single-player due to my possessing a slow internet.   Imagine being a future ninja in space, and you'll have a pretty rough idea of what Warframe is right there. Warframe is a lovely free to play first person ninja game, in which you travel through a variety (over 200) different missions as you seek to bring balance to a super-future version of our own sol-system. For a free-to-play title in beta, this game feels more complete and well-done than many retail games available at this time.   You can, if careful (the game is not a walk through the park, and success feels like you've truly accomplished something), sneak through an entire level without alerting a single of your varied enemies as you complete objectives assigned to you. Or you could run in with dual revolvers and re-enact scenes of the wild-west on spaceships orbiting Mars. The choice is up to you, and the game certainly accomodates for whatever playstyle you're looking for so long as you're willing to put the effort in.  From the various missions you complete, you can acquire a variety of materials that can be later used to craft new weapons that offer a different feel on the game. After having played the game only with shooty-guns that made lots of noise and sneaking difficult, I acquired a bow that allowed me to move through an entire level without an enemy seeing me, at least until someone saw me sniping his friend and sounding the alarm.  Much to your future detriment, the enemies in this game are not as stupid as in some others. They will sound the alarm at the slightest sign of your presence, alerting anyone nearby (or not, much to my annoyance) to your location. This is actually where I get quite annoyed with the game, as when you've just sneaked through an entire area, assassinating every target along the way without anyone seeing you, I might add, it's very annoying when an entire battalion comes from no-where from what was minutes ago empty (and possibly blood-stained) corridors.  However, it is a fairly easy thing to turn off these alarms, wipe out the remaining enemy, and then continue on your way. And in the spawning of more opponents, there is the ever-present accompaniment of experience to carry you along. However, this does not mean that if you play for ten hours you will immediately wipe the floor of someone just starting. All leveling up does is give you access to an increased limit to the number of 'mods' you can have on any one item.  You get mods from killing enemies, and mods change how your weapons work (only for the better, may I add. No need to balance what you're getting and what you're losing) A major part of this game is figuring out the best combinations for the enemies you will be facing, certain damage types being more effective against enemies with armor than enemies with shields. If you're ever finding it tricky to work out the very best way to format these mods, the game has an auto-fill option for what it thinks is best for your weapons, but mods are mostly for you to make everything to your preferance, so take some time to decide these things.  Besides customizable weapons, there are also a variety of Warframes that vastly change how you play, such as character speed, size, health, and special abilities. You start out playing as the Excalibur model for the tutorial, but at the end you can choose from one of three options. I recommend you think carefully of what you choose, as though you can later on acquire the two you didn't choose, it will take alot of time and effort to do so. As of writing this, I have played over seventy hours of Warframe and still have only the starting Excalibur Warframe. It's good for beginners, but you're not going to be a beginner for long, so I recommend you seriously think about the other two options.  Unfortunately, though understandable now that free-to-play games always have these features, there are micro-transactions in this game. They allow you to purchase Weapons, Warframes, various pieces of Equipment, and Sentinels, who are little guys who fly around and help you out. I have not yet obtained one of these, so I know next to nothing about them.  However, what I like about this game a good deal is the crafting system that lets you make all the weapons available for 'Platinum' and then some that aren't, so you can, with some ease, acquire all the weapons in the game fairly quickly, though you'll be hard-pressed to find a place to put them all as there is an inventory limit that can be expanded through the use of, you guessed it, Platinum i.e real money. You start with fifty platinum, which is enough to get a couple more spaces, but it still irks me that I'm pretty much out of room for more weapons when I've only just gotten the dual revolvers.  Besides all that, there are also clans that you can join, or make yourself fairly easily. What really makes these clans interesting, though, are the Dojos. Each clan gets to have their own space station that they can customize a good deal, from obstacle courses to dueling rings to enhanced crafting rooms for making even more stuff. Making the Dojo recquire you to build a key out of components available from the first level, though if you want to create the more interesting rooms within, like the Oracle or an Obstacle course, you will recquire a very rare item called Forma, that I have yet to acquire.  This game does have a multiplayer co-op, in which you and three others go into the various missions available and try to accomplish whatever the Lotus (Lady who tells you to do stuff) wants you to do. I have not tried it (bad internet), but I can imagine having four super-ninjas running around would be a great deal of fun.  Which brings me to an interesting point about this game. It's not just a run-and-gun or sneaking about holding the Ctrl key to stay out of sight, this game features a great deal of manuevurability that lets you still be shooting or sneaking while using. Wall climbing, wall runs, running slides, jumping up and then sliding to soar through the air (a very cool looking move that can knock enemies over if well-timed) as well as the use of these in combination with melee attacks to finish off your enemies in style.  This system of movement works very well in combat, allowing you to chain a wall run into a leaping stab or diving off a ledge to ground pound a group of enemies Iron Man style (It is very cool, believe me, and a viable tactic for combat). This system also helps out in stealth, quickly diving to another point of cover while an enemy's back is turned or moving through a grate system to get a tactical advantage.  With a large arsenal of rifles, bows, shotguns, pistols, revolvers, kunai, swords, hammers, axes, boomerangs, and a variety of special attacks unique to each Warframe, this game can and will certainly keep you entertained for a long while. And that's just the gameplay.  The game comes along with an interesting story that is told to you by Lotus when she describes your missions for you, from the constant battles fought between Grineer (a race who have cloned themselves so much that they require technological aid to be able to battle) and Corpus (I think they're robots who re-animate dead people to fight, but I'm not sure on that) to discovering that the Earth is being slowly poisoned by the Grineer in an attempt to have compete control over the planet.  And then there's just trying to figure out some info on yourself, the Tenno, a people who slept dormant for a long time before being re-awoken to inhabit the Warframes to bring stability to a system torn apart with war, all without their memory I might add.  I myself still have a great deal of this game to explore and enjoy, and I recommend that if you're at all interested in the above, you give this free game a go. I'm glad I did.",

Literally the only things not available without platinum (the paid for in game currency) are color pallettes for you character and inventory slots, but you can actually trade with people for platinum, so technically even those things are not a limiting factor.  I would definitely recommend this game. I mean, it is free to play, so there is nothing to lose.",

Sure it's a personal preference game so whether you like it or not is completely up to you, but I think that it's vastly underrated. Yes the game has extortionate in-game purchases but you don't need to buy anything at all, sure you may have to grind a couple of days/weeks but it's worth it.   This solid game with addictive mechanics to keep you coming back for more. While the game overall lacks mission diversity, the amount of weapons, Warframes(Characters) and more that keep on getting added and added on into each update will keep you coming back for more if you get yourself into it. I'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a challenge and an extraordinary grind.",

            "review_text": "Warframe is a very fun and additctive game that at the time of this review is in beta. This is a MUST try game in my opinion, where the graphics are nice the physics and fighting are extremly fun and who wouldn't love 'space ninjas'. As with all free to plays Warframe has platinum which is the currency that you buy with real money, which you use to buy slots for warframes, weapons, and accessories. Now without platinum you get stuck with only a couple warframes and weapons, with the only way being around this is hoping to get a 50% or 75% (for the best deal of course) and buying platinum or getting into the trading which is confusing and a little annoying at first but after a while you can get used to it. Warframe has quite a few differnt mission types and even has a few quests, some of which unlock warframes. Sadly Warframe in i'ts current state is just about the most grindy game I have ever seen, where you might have to kill a boss many, many, MANY times to get the warframe parts or resource you want from that specific boss. Or you might need to do a certain void mission over and over to get the prime part you're looking for. But in my opinion grinding for a new warframe or weapon and using it is worth all the effort as almost every warframe and weapon have distinct differences and you always feel like you can find something new and interesting in what you're doing in the game (other than when farming of course, I recommend grinding with friends and music and other fun things to distract from the boring drone of grinding). But no matter what you feel like about this game from this review if you havent put at least 5-10 hours into the game you haven't given it a fair chance!",

Some things may be repetetive, but isn't every game that nowadays? Warframe is getting updated now and then, and new things is getting fixed and added, witch will lay down the repetetive gameplay for some time. Just remember to take breaks otherwise it might get repetetive alot faster. if you're new then don't worry the game has alot of diffrent play styles to start out with: 'survival, defense, capture, exterminate, interception, mobile defense, highjack, hive and boss fight' so it will not get boring.  It is a free2play game and within that theres ofc a ingame currency called 'platinum' that you have to purchase to get. But if you don't want that you can always sell blueprints of stuff to other people and gain it that way, witch in my opinion is one of the great ways to make ingame currency.  Warframe status currently in my opinion:  ###-Positive-###  + Mastery rank + Warframe&amp;weapon rank + Many weapons + Trading system + Clan dojo + Many planets + Diffrent races + Competetive is an option + Online matchmaking + Quests + Diffrent warframes + Build time is not too long + Some glitches make it fun + Card mods 'to pump the gun' + Alliance + Game style + Kubrow + Clem  ###-Negative-###  - Wall glitches - Platinum is not so cheap - Can get repetetive - Rewards can be duplicated (annoying when defense or survival in void) - Sometimes the loading screen is not loading - rescue guy is sometimes stuck",

In virtually every other aspect, the game is a dream-like playground for fans of games like mass effect, unreal tournament, or in some ways even Prince of Persia and Ninja Gaiden.   There is wall running handled in a well executed manner, there is melee combat complete with actual combos and timing as well as blocking, there is evil space creatures and factions to kill and hate, and there is a huge array of both weapons and warframes to choose from and collect in order to diversify your experience. Even recently a new system of flight combat was added straight out of a space shooter sim hybrid.   While it is true the game is VERY light on story line or explanation, and can become quite grindy after a deep binge of obsessive exposure, the core systems of the game are bieng constantly improved and there is NO pay 2 win mechanic because anything you can acquire through the shop except for a very few cosmetics are all obtainable in game.   PvP players be warned however, this game is not about PvP, at all, and the PvP aspect of the game is not very well realized or implemented at this point. While PvP is playable, it is certainly not for everyone and is not what the game is focused around at all.",

The game is slightly difficult to get into when you are just starting out but once figure out the ins and outs it is very enjoyable. An amazing amount of customization for your character to play however you want to play and 99% of the game can be done without spending a dime. The lore of the game is still being uncovered by frequent updates and additions, but the basis is you are a futuristic space ninja moving from place to place, battle to battle gunning down enemies with tons of guns and/or slicing or bashing your way through enemies with just as many melee weapons.  The only (possible) downside is how you acquire items in this game. Its a 100% RNG grind by chance. You want that item you better be ready to run that mission over and over. But regardless of that when you do run those missions whether it be solo or with a squad of friends 9/10 times its a great time.",

            "review_text": "One of the best free to play games I've ever played.  Pay to win game? Hell no. Most of everything in the game can be earned through missions, either it be boss fights, surviving in defense or survival missions for a long time, or going into the void and doing missions.  RANK SYSTEM : You rank up throughout the game, either by doing missions, leveling up your weapons, etc. When you have a higher rank, it allows you to use epic weapons of mass destruction. I'm not kidding. Some of the weapons in the game just destroy everything in it's path with little effort.  WARFRAMES : There are tons of Warframes to gather throughout the game. At the start you get to pick between 3 warframes. EXCALIBER, VOLT, and LOKI. If you like stealth, go with Loki. If you like slicing enemies into little bits of meat, go with Excaliber. If you like frying your enemies with electricity and super human speed, go with Volt.  Other warframes can be gathered through boss fights, void missions, or alerts.  WEAPONS : Tons and tons of weapons to choose from, giving you a different experience everytime. You can switch up weapons easily and change your style anytime you want in your Arsenal.   PRIMARY WEAPONS : You have your rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, flame throwers, rocket launchers, laser guns that shoot laser cubes and explode on impact with a chain of more explosions, guns that shoot bolts that pin enemies to walls, rifles that shoot lasers that cut through groups of enemies, sniper rifles. etc.  SECONDARY WEAPONS : You have your pistols, hand held rocket launchers, infected pistols that shoot poison and radiate enemies, one handed automatic crossbows, duel magnums, duel machine gun pistols, pistols that can also shoot bolts and pin enemies to walls, duel one handed shotguns, etc.  MELEE WEAPONS : You have quite a selection. Two handed swords, warhammers, giant axes, and maces.  One handed swords, either they can be normal swords, or infected swords, eletric plasma swords, fire swords, or heavy hitting maces, axes, hammers, scythes, ninja stars, a blade weapon that can be thrown that cuts down enemies in it's path and comes back to you like a boomerang, then can be used for close range attacks, etc.  SENTINELS : These little guys are droids that follow you around, there are a few of them, but are worth getting for a little extra help. I apologize that I cannot remember the names lol, but the one I use is like a vaccum. It sucks up all the ammo and loot, even energy orbs and health orbs. It also has a shotgun equipped to it, so if enemies come close they get blasted in the face.  Some sentinels are used for just doing tons of damage, but others are used to make go invisible, stomp the ground making enemies fall on their butt, or suck up everything with a vaccum. I recommend getting the vaccum one if you're a new player, since you'll get so much more loot with little effort.  Sentinels can have mods put into them and can be leveled just like your weapons and warframe. Mods like emergency shields incase you're shields run out, a deflecting shield when you are reviving a teammate it will pop a shield over you to give you a little more time to revive before getting attacked. Also it can have weapon mods added into it. Some only use rifle, or shotgun mods. So if you have some extra mods laying around, you can stick them inside your sentinel.  BOSS FIGHTS : Most of the boss fights are epic, each boss does it's own thing and has it's own way of being defeated. Once you defeat a boss, you'll get some materials and a mod. At the end of the mission is when you get a blueprint. Gather blueprints to create whatever the blueprint was, you'll need to defeat the boss a couple of times because it's random when it comes to getting blueprints. Example : Getting the Rhino warframe, defeat the boss and you get a RHINO SYSTEMS blueprint. You'll need to get the RHINO CHASIS and the RHINO HELMET as well, in order to build the Rhino.   So you'll need to fight the boss more than once if you want all the blueprints for that certain warframe. Sometimes you'll keep getting the same blueprint, but you can sell the extra blueprints for some credits if you're not going to use it.  RANDOM ASSASSINATIONS : Most of the time when you kill a boss you'll get a thing in the mail saying 'You'll pay for what you have done, TENNO'   This means that a assassin will come and try to kill you randomly in a mission. You're screen will start to flicker and that's signals that the assassin is coming for you. If it's flickering but you do no receive a messege saying they are coming for you, that means the assassin is coming for someone else in your group.  These assassins are able to be killed, but won't go down easy if you're a low level. Once they are killed you get a blueprint from them. If it's the STALKER, you get a chance to get either one of his weapons. It can be the DREAD, which is the bow and arrow, HATE which is his melee scythe weapon, and his secondary which I forgot. Most of the time you'll get the Dread bow, I have like 14 of them lol.  There are other assassins which I won't spoil for you lol. But most of the time you'll be hunted by the Stalker, once you start killing high leveled bosses, that's when higher leveled assassins will come for you, and they all do different things and have different styles of fighting.  WHEN an a assassin comes, they only go for their target and no one else unless they get in the way. So play it smart and get some distance so your teammates can pound them into the ground, making it easier to kill them.  DOJO/CLANS : A dojo is where you can design and build your own base. Adding rooms and decorations to each spot and being able to build workshops that create weapons that cannot be purchased in the market with credits. So you'll get access to some really unique weapons. You get to build 3 workshops and they're all different. One is for Grineer weapons, the other is Corpus weapons, and the last is Infected weapons.   This will allow you to research and build weapons that the enemies are using and can use them for yourself. I recommend new players to join other clans/dojos. Because it costs a lot of materials to build your own dojo. Usually other clans have fully built these workshops and have researched everything. If you decide to build your own, that's cool too, but it'll cost a lot of materials and it takes a lot of effort doing it by yourself.  COMMUNITY : The community is cool most of the time. You'll always have high ranked players helping low ranked players with missions or boss fights. I like to go help ranked 2 players, because I can give them mods and other goodies. When you play for a long time, you'll gather so much materials you won't know what to do with it, so it's best to give them to low ranked players, or go to the trading chat to sell. (You'll need to be rank #2 in order to trade in a dojo, and need credits too, because the dojo might have a trading fee)  TRADING SYSTEM : You can trade with other players in a Dojo, by them inviting you to it, or you inviting them. You can trade all sorts of stuff, Void keys, mods, blueprints, etc. It's impossible to be scammed in the game, and everybody usually doesn't try to anyways. I recommend going to the Warframe Wiki and checking out the prices for rare mods, because sometimes you'll have players lie about the platinum price for the item you're trying to sell or buy. Trades go smooth most of the time, I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable about trading, I'm just saying that you should do some research about it before doing so.  UPDATES/EVENTS : These guys update this game almost twice every month, and everytime it's something big, they usually add missions where you can get some sweet weapons or other goodies. Events are awesome too, because you'll get a chance to get all the blueprints for one warframe, or get a sweet looking helmet for your warframe or a weapons.",

But this one caught me by surprise. The graphics are great. The particle systems are a nice touch as well. The game doesn't try to be too much. It's comfortable being what it is.. an acrobatic, sci-fi, space shooter. Get together with a few other random players, slide, wall-run, swing swords and fire high powered weapons at space scum as you traverse our solar system. It's clean, simple, visually impressive fun. I will probably never play this game hardcore but I will definitely pick it up from time to time. I may even drop some scrilla on it at some point.",

There are always ways around it. If a piece of equipment catches your eye and you don't want to use money then with some effort you can buy blueprints and get it that way.  The game itself is great. While it can feel a bit 'grindy' and the levels a bit repetitive it gets much better when you have others to play with you. The combat is flowing and challenging and allows for a variety of approaches from ramged to close quarters to running for the hills. To make a long story short....GET THIS GAME!

Warframe is set in the future in a time period when space travel have ben made all around our solar system. I must admit I like Warframe more since you have more stuff you can craft and more weapon customizations wich can totally change how a weapon behaves. I don't enjoy co-op games that much but thankfully if you bring the proper equipment and use your head more then brute streght you can solo all content exept for raids. Raids require min. 4 players, has a max. of 8 players and there are some puzzle elements to them that require coordination and timing with other players it is intended for experienced players. Clans in this game are not just for the name tag, you can build your own solo little clan or join up with people and have your own base where you place rooms, hallways, powergenerators and research labs and develope new technology and new weapons that the clan members can use.  Also this game is completly free. All you need is time and dedication and you can get all the frames all the weapons. Any extra items you got you can trade or sell them to other players for credits wich is the games currency or 'Platinum' wich you can use for extra frame or weapon slots or to buy skins.",

In all seriousness, this game is really fun in moderation. Playing it for too long will probably have you bored from the grind. And yes, the grind is real. However, the grind is also incredibly rewarding. There are so many cool and unique weapons and warframes you can aquire and customize to your own playstyle. For casual players, there is nothing that is not viable and not hella fun to use. The graphics are amazing for a f2p and the combat just feels oh so good. Almost everything in the game can be aquired without paying a cent for it, the only exception being some cosmetics. Even better, since the game has daily login rewards, you have a fairly high chance to get a discount on the paid-for currency. Just set yourself a goal for a play session, like getting a certain blueprint or the resources for a new weapon, and just do that once a day.",

I don't know a lot of people that can say they absolutely hate this game, and really, the only real complaint one might hear about this game is the fact that grinding for a frame takes 5 whole evers. In general, this game is better with friends as well, and connections are fast, easy and smooth. The game requires nearly nothing out of a modern computer and can be played by anyone that loves to feel like a ninja once in a while! Some of the major problems that I have with the game personally are the drop rates. For certain materials, you can just smell the freemium coming off of them, such as Forma, but they are still attainable without having to buy funymuny. One other major problem is more of a community based thing where random people will join the little people of the world, also known as noobs, and skrekekekekek everything in sight and leave the noob standing there, lonely, poor and sad. It really can ruin the gaming experience for the poor little noob, so that is a slight problem. One last con here, the occaisonal brokeness of a frame or two. Obviously, whenever one frame is nerfed, it just creates an opportunity for another, slightly less broken frame to have a window of framefame. This is just kind of a thing, nothing too major. I hate Ash, that is about it for that #TopKek  The Summary: This game is good, a few problems here and there, but in general, they are 100% okay, because you can manage them with a load of time. Broken frame, fix with time, no big deal, and also people are a problem, but you can just close your lobby and invite people you know are not noob farmers.  The Verdict: Hearts! Hearts across the board! I love this game and for about two weeks straight, I forgot how to eat because Nyx (love it, cannot live without it). The grade, out of 100, I will give this game an 89/100, a B+. I do not normally grade a community, but the big players I give a 12/100, seriously, you guys ruin games, let the little ones play, how would you have liked it?

            "review_text": "It's not worth playing 10k Hours.  Lets start with the enemy scaling. (Reminder: Games are designed for Casuals, the mayority of the population)  The enemy scaling in warframe is like this: Depending on the game mode, the enemy level increases. The higher the enemy level gets, the more health, shields and armor he gets AND the more damage he deals. Your character (Warframe) on the other hand doesnt at all scale with the enemy level. you can only level up your warframe till lvl 30, put on some mods. Which means your cap are capped mods. This means, enemies one shot you before they turn into bulletsponges. As a result the options you have to create 'end game viable' Warframe builds are highly limited and offer you a boring and binary play style.  Binary playstyle - the options you have are: a) Invisibility: you get invisible, stay invisible, and slaughter everything. dont get hit - you ll die with one shot. and the accuracy of the enemiese damn. (e.g. Loki's ability 'invisibility' or Focus - Naramon Tree)  b)invincibility: the 2nd viable option. you dont take damage means, you cant get one shotted at all. (Valkyr - hysteria. trinity got nerfed on a wednesday) Well trinity's ability 'Blessing' gave you( before it got nerfed) a up to 99% dmg reduction. 99% dmg reduction was awesome, because you and your team was invincible for a certain amount of time. everything below 99% dmg reduction, e.g. 98% dmg reduction, was utter crap. and dont forget that the enemies' damage scales with their level. which is why it is going to be crap soon.  Non viable playstyles are: 'i m going to catch all the bullets and take damage while my friends kill everything' it doesnt work, you dont do it. in warframe this strategy works like this: you catch 2 bullets and bleed out until someone revives you or you die. you cant even be the 'tank' while you are invincible because the enemies attack everyone.  How do you kill enemies?  there are a few options: a) Ability spamming Warframe is a game, designed around ability spam. abilities save you and some frames are only viable as long as you can keep their abilities active. for example valkyr, limbo (gets redesigned), excalibur, chroma, frost, etc. i probably forgot some. some of those abilities are by far stronger than any weapon ingame. You might think now: 'Why should i use a weapon at all, i can kill everything with abilities!?' and yes you are right you can, and a lot of players do that, just kidding, everyone does that! BUT now we have some enemies which have the 'Despell' ability. again: your warframe is only viable while using its abilities on one hand and on the other hand you have enemies able to despell the abilities you are forced to rely on due to the broken enemy scaling. Something is wrong here.  b) melee weapons (and beeing invisible and/or invincible) you take a melee weapon of your choice and kill all the things while no enemy attacks you because they cant. you know, they cant see you even if they know you are here.  c) buff abilities and a few 'OP' weapons (and beeing invisible and/or invincible) you can buff your warframes, spread spores with saryn, cast sonar/silence as banshee, etc and simply one shot everything as long as possible.  In warframe enemies dont drop health orbs as regular drop at all. the only way to get healthorbs as drops are a) you destroy crates and open lockers, maybe you get some b) Nekros - Desecrate c) Oberon - ultimate d) some other ridiculously stupid ways to get health orbs.  your warframes have ~200 (low level) hp up to ~1400 based on your warframe. only one warframe can have up to 5k+ hit points (even with 5k hp you are going to die with 1 shot after you reached a certain enemylevel) the healthorbs you can find give you 25 or 50 hp back which is nothing and health orbs dont stay they despawn.  In the archwing gamemode healthorbs are a regular drop but it isnt in the regular game mode. why?  What can you do? a) you can play 'balanced' 'PvP' cant tell you much about it, i dont like it which is why i dont play it. my opinion on this topic would be biased  b) Dark Sectors: Some sort of endgame which is currently not available.  c)Lunaros: New fun game - havent played it yet.  d)Archwing: Fly in space and kill things, afaik it gets an onverhaul - again.  e)Regular PvE ('farmframe'): The Mainpart of the game. you farm resources to build things, things you need to level in order to get mastery points, mastery points to increase your mastery level until you have leveled everything and ask yourself the question: 'What next?' in the end you realize that there is no content and if you dont teach new players how to play it gets boring very fast and you hop to the next game until warframe offers more 'content' again. You want the new stuff? farm it! or go to g)  but if you farm mit the game works basically like this. you have common stuff and prime stuff, prime stuff is better than common stuff. for prime stuff you play void missions for common stuff you play the game and void missions. to play void missions you have to have void keys. to get void keys you play common missions or void missions. which means: you play void missions to get credits, prime stuff and void keys.(i ll talk about drop tables after this paragraph) conclusion: you end up playing void void and more void. you dont care about the common missions anymore after a while.  f) 'Chatframe': you use the ingame chat to communicate with people you met ingame.  g) 'tradeframe:' you farm Credits to be able to trade and (re)sell stuff to get platinum(the good currency) in order to buy all the stuff because you hate 'farmframe'   Drop tables: as previously mentioned you can get void keys from void missions. Let me explain it like this: You open your garage with your key and your key gets destroyed, pick up another key somewhere in your garage, get to your car, drive to work, drive home, open the garage again with the key you got in your garage which gets destroyed, you park your car in the garage, pick up a new key for your garage and so on. what i mean is: the game has beautiful tilesets, the level designers do a great job but the only tile set you see is simply the void tileset - nothing else.  endless missions offer different rewards you might get annoyed by: e.g. in a survival mission you get a new random reward every 5 minutes. But those rewards do not feel like a reward after a certain amount of time. for example you get Reward A at the 5 minute mark, you can get reward A again at the 10,25,30,45,50... and so on minute mark AGAIN. what i want to say is: the rewards dont get 'better' or at least the reward system does not feel like it is 'rewarding' you for playing the game.  'We are 5 minutes into this survival it s ok to get a crap reward.... 1 orokin cell... well ok, i figured as much...' *after 65 minutes survival* 'We survived for 65 minutes now! we have to get a good reward!!!... nooo not again 1 Orokin Cell'",

            "review_text": "More than 600 hours and counting...I feel like I'm ready for a review.  I've been playing this game since 2013, despite my seemingly low amount of hours for a Free-to-Play cooperative third-person hack-and-slash/shooter game that's been out for now 3 years on Steam. Watching this game grow and become what it is now has been a treat and I will continue to track and follow this game for the foreseeable future, but there are some issues I'll warn against with this game.  For new players, this game seems like a godsend. The graphics are beautiful and worthy of any AAA studio, despite many believing this game would fail during its humble beginnings. The gameplay is solid and damn near the best I've ever enjoyed in a video game thanks to its solid and almost freeform flow between gunplay and melee combat coupled with its ever satisfying and enjoyable 'parkour' system. The number of weapons, cosmetics, and playable characters rival even the heaviest hitters of the RPG genre, such as Borderlands. Best of all, damn near everything in the game can be obtained for absolutely free. The greatest part of this game is certainly the fact that this game is still constantly being updated, cared for, and nurtured by its developers and now its own community thanks to the Tennogen system. However, for veterans, this may be the game's greatest flaw.  For veteran players like me and plenty others, its difficult to muster up the passion to play this game after farming for every single thing we want in this game, and then some. For a lot of older players with all the weapons, Warframes, resources, mods, cosmetics, clans, solar rails, and completed quests we could ever want, we don't pick the game back up for sometimes months at a time as we wait for the next big update to add in the new story quest or new Warframe/weapons or new event which interest us enough to hop back on. Then, once we, for the umpteenth time, grind the new piece of equipments' resources then grind for its levels to later slap a 'potato' on to and then play maybe one more survival with it, we just put the game back down and wait again. I find it a bit sad that even I beg the devs for new content I'll acquire and max out within a month or so just to put the game back down for another few months in anticipation of the next new chunks of content.  In short, new players are sure to love this should you be able to push through the grindfest that is Warframe, as you'll soon be grinding without even realizing what you're grinding for. As for veterans of Warframe, try convincing friends to join so you can enjoy helping the Lotus teach them the ways of the Tenno. If all else fails, the game's creative community has some of the best fan art and cosplay I've seen in a while.  P.S. You can buy everything instead of farming for it, but not every single person has the liquidity to drop hundreds of dollars on a free-to-play game. For those who farm by choice, you guys and gals are the true MVPs.",

If that is not your type of game, warframe will not hook your interest. This game is a very satsifying third person shooter, the characters you play as- Tenno, control sort of like the classes in Mass Effect 3's multiplayer in the way that each has their own varying health, sheild, stamina and power base. Each frame comes equiped with certain powers that can either damage enemies or contain them and negate their ability to do damage. The game is constanly being updated on a weekly basis with new weapons, cosmetics and sometimes new enhancements to the game to make it look pretty. This game offers a sort of, 'Pay now and get this item sooner' mentality. No, this game is not a pay2win, everything in the game besides certain cosmetics, IE Scarfs, statless armor peices and some color palettes can be acquired with just playtime. Helmets can be gained through alerts which popup frequently. If you want to get into this game or just learn more about it, like elemental types or faction specific enemies and what items they drop, then i HIGHLY reccomend heading over to the warframe wiki. Over all, this is a wonderful game and one that i would reccomend to anyone who enjoys shooting, cutting and blowing up some mobs. 9/10",

I've invested quite a lot of time into this game, however if you compare this number to veteren players I would still be considered more of an amateur than my peers. This is ultimately meaningless however as there are all manner of players ranging from hardcore to casual and anything in between.   I've seemingly managed to power through a lot of content that most have taken double the time to complete however I have had help most of the way. This is where the game shines through the most in my opinion. Playing with friends is a very rewarding experience as most of the time you'll find yourselves working towards the same objectives whether it's gaining that new and shiny gear or simply experiencing the latest update and all it has to bring. The sense of camaraderie with both friends and even random players as you work towards your goals is something I feel every time I venture in, despite how well versed with this game I've already become. That is of course not to say that the game doesn't hold up as a solo experience, but I'd highly recommend bringing a long a friend or two... or three. The community in this game is worth commending both for their general friendliness and tolerance as well as their contributions to the game. Many of the game's features are derived directly from the imagination of the playerbase such as the famous 'Clem' figure.  The game however, is not without its flaws as minor as they may be. Currently the game is still technically in its beta phase despite its large size and you will no doubt come across a number of glitches and issues. Almost every time however, these have provided chuckles and good memories and some extreme examples will go down in Warframe history forever. Another problem I find is that although the game is free to play, if you in any way want to progress you will most likely have to fork over some cash in order to gain the game's virtual currency used to buy equipment space and other such things associated with 'premium currencies'. This is circumvented through the use of the trading system however not only is this a much more tedious way of gaining currency, it still doesn't make up for the fact that at some point someone would have had to have bought currency to trade with in the first place.  Despite its flaws, and I must reiterate that they are indeed minor, this game is absolutely incredible through both the scope of content available and the sheer enjoyment it provides. Never have I encountered a Free-To-Play title with such quality, comparable to a AAA title. This game has given more to me than most ever will and I'll never forget the experiences that I've gotten and will continue to gain. The developers are constantly working to add more and more to this game and I'm positive it will continue its success for a long time.",

So much has been added, I cant even begin to list it. They have quests for warframes and weapons, as well as quests for the lore of the game. They have added entire new combat systems and revamped the old. They have taken a standard parkor system and made it amazing.

Next, you have to wait 12-24 hours for that weapon to be build. Then once you have it built you must level it to 30 in order to get the full potential of the weapon, and sometimes those weapons need forma to reach full potential. So now you have to level it 3-6 more times.( Not to mention getting all the mods and leveling all the necessary mods). I have spent over 1500+ hours playing this game, grinding my ♥♥♥ off mindlessly while hanging out with friends or listening to music, if I have nothing else to do.

Also, the AI has been improved so you can now be stealthy rather than be caught a kilometer away while crouching. Lastly, the movement controls are a lot more fluid; running around looks a lot more natural (plus running and crouching doesn't give you that speed boost anymore).  In terms of meta-gameplay (ie. salvaging money, metals, items etc.) it's still pretty much the same. To progress in the story, you need to scavenge materials to meet blueprints which build items you can use. This makes it grindy which I dislike. If you can get past the stunning graphics of this game, you will see that it is a grind fest. Don't get me wrong, though; it's good fun!  7/10 - Good",

The concept itself is just so tempting, you're a space ninja who beats up robots, ugly guys and sometimes space zombies! The graphics and art style fit the game perfectly. It has a great combat system, large selection of weapons and a vast amount of mods you can apply to make your weapon suit whatever roll you need. And each warframe has it's own abilities, and they are awesome! They range from distractions, teleporting, freezing, poisoning, creating black holes, clearing a room in a single stomp or even punching your enemies very soul out of their body! Theres just too much to talk about at once, it'd make your head spin. Great and helpful community and an awesome Dev team who just work on this game because they love to! The only money they get really is from people who pay for in-game currency, platinum. This is where most F2P games fail. Free to play but Pay to Win! This is not the case, everything you see can be obtained without pumping any money at all into your warframe account. Want a new gun? Buy a blueprint and get the resources! most of the time it isnt even that hard to grind for them. Tho warframes can take wuite a long time to obtain without money, it's so much more fun and rewarding doing it manually. What can't be bought from blueprints are available via random events. Seriously, if you havn't played this game. Just go, get this, now! It's badass! It's fun! IT'S FREE! You have nothing to loose except countless hours :P",

            "review_text": "This game honestly wasn't what I epected when I started playing. I figured, 'Oh an action MMO, so we're looking at a massive world full of people all doing random quests only with guns'. Wrong. The world is divided into small maps that you play with teams and completing each map unlocks the next. The combat is fast, requiring you to go back and forth between shooting things to slicing them up with melee attacks. The sheer depth of customization options you have is astounding, and the way that skills are handled is a nice addition. The graphics themselves are nice, and players can drop in to a map in the middle of play so you may start a map with only you and another player but end it with 4-5 people. There is an element of grind present, as to manufacture gear once you have the blueprints you need materials for which you'll either have to pay Platinum (the real-monet currency) or play maps over a few times to get what you need from enemy drops (easier to do on Survival levels). Also, leveling up yourself is a seperate things from leveling weapons and frames, and ranking up as a player requires completing 'challenges' which you need to wait 24 hours to try again if you fail.  I have a few problems with the game; First, you're kind of thrown to the wolves when it comes to initialy setting up your character, but the Wiki helps. Secondly, I feel that, while the graphics are wonderful and the visuals themselves nicely done, the bio-mechanical look of the game could have been done better. That's not to say that it looks like crap, just that the disproportionate bodies of the enemies can look out of place compared to the avatars of the you and the other players. Sometimes the game won't remember the mods I've added to weapons/frames after I exit that menu, but that might be something I'm doing wrong and not the game itself  You're best option, if you try the game and enjoy it, is to buy the $40 starter pack. You'll seriously need the in-game and real money currencies as well as the other bonuses to help get yourself started, otherwise you're stuck with the most basic of basic gear for quite a long time.",

Would recommend if you can deal with a decent amount of grinding and some bugs. Also this game is still in BETA!  I The game modes are: Exterminate (eliminate all enemies), Mobile Defense (taking a DataMass to a Control Panel, then defending it), Defense (defending something for 5 waves at a time), Survival (survive a mass onslaught of enemies for as long as possible, rewards every 10 minutes), Excavate (defend and keep a scanner and its excavators powered to extract resources, Interception (you Capture and Defend several points from being taken over by enemies), Sabotage (Destroy a Reactor), Assassinate (all boss missions, and to kill high valued targets), and Hijack (defend a mobile target and possibly destroy it). The game is 100% Co-Op, unless you go to the PVP (Player Versus Player) areas. Graphics are good. Gameplay is very grindy, sometimes buggy, and very well balanced. Bugs well crap…  II The game is grind worthy, grinding through many missions to progress is slightly boring. But considering that each mission is never the same, in the sense that they will always look different from the last time you played it. All weapons can be OP if you mod then properly, and you obtain mods from trading other players, rewards from missions, or by defeating enemies. There are Warframes, which is basically your suit with magical powers that are very destructive against enemies. There are 300ish missions and more than 10 different planets/moons with 10 or more missions each, with their matching environmental art styles. Each Warframe has their own special four abilities unique to that Warframe. Warframes’ abilities range from being able to turn invisible, to being able to stomp the ground and suspend all the enemies in the air, to shooting spikes into every enemy within your sights. The weapons in game can range from a Jet Power Hammer, to a Pistol that shoots rockets, to a gun that shoots circular blades or bolts. The lore is very simple, and easy to remember. There are three main factions, the Grineer that are a bunch of brain washed clones, the Corpus that probably are like humans, and the infested that are infested creatures of doom. There is an enemy called the Stalker that rarely shows up if a boss curses you, and then there are the G3 and Zanuka that do the same thing. You have these syndicates that are 6 different groups, you sign up with one and then you trade this thing called standing for a mod that boosts your Warframe’s abilities, or a weapon, or something else. The basic 300 missions, are the normal missions, then there are Void missions and derelict missions. Void missions come in 4 Tiers, each increasing Tier number indicates increasing difficulty. There is a void boss called Corrupted Vor, he comes around just as rarely as the Stalker does, but only in the void. Derelict are basically the Tier 3 and 4 but only with infested enemies. Also customization of your Warframe/weapons is pretty good, you can change every color to whatever you want, and same for additional cosmetics. Credits are the basic currency in the game, Orokin Ducats are prime pieces (rewards from void missions) traded for special currency to be traded for Primed mods/cosmetics, and the premium currency platinum. Platinum can be earned by the login rewards, by trading rare mods/prime components, or by purchasing them.   Archwing I have not done too much of this yet, as such I am unable to give 100% valid information. AFAIK (As Far As I Know), you have a jetpack and fly through space and continue your basic objectives, and you can go fast just like Sonic the Hedgehog. This is mainly unfinished structure added into the game, there have been several alerts in game using this game type; but it remains with little content.  III Alerts One of the best ways of acquiring rare mods/items is through daily/special alerts. There are daily alerts that often reward with only credits or a few resources, but sometimes they have a rare mod or weapon as a reward, sometimes rare resources. Normally a weapon or some high cost item would be reward from a Tactical Alert, rarely some type of cosmetic items. Tactical Alerts are long and tedious alerts that last a week or so, in which the player needs to complete a very hard challenge in order to obtain said item(s). The Tactical Alerts are mainly for experienced players, who are looking for challenge.  IV Raids Raids are very hard (in my opinion much more difficult than Tactical Alerts), they offer a rare arcane item, and require a massive amount of teamwork. There currently is only one raid in the game, it has several team based puzzles/challenges, which works well with 8 player squads. In the end you face off a very easy to kill boss, as long as you don’t die.  My rating:  All in all I would rate it an 8/10. Would recommend if you can deal with much grinding/some bugs/ absolute nonsense.",

If you do want to pick this game up I advise that you play with a friend so that it will be more entertaining. otherwise here are the games pros and cons.  pros: -nice diversity in characters &amp; weapons to choose from and use   - graphics are nice to look at (especially at max settings)   - blood and gore is always a plus  - can use in-game currency to buy warframes(characters) and weapons  - you never feel like the game is pay to win  cons: - in order to obtain new warframes and weapons in-game without buying them you have to buy the blueprints, obtain  all of the materials to craft said item via the games crafting system and crafting times are fairly long ranging anywhere  from 12-70 hours in real time also you have to do all of this with in-game currency.   - level designs are incredibly repetative as you will see the same level designs several times over the course of your  playthrough.  - two leveling systems profile leveling (Mastery)/character&amp;weapon leveling. yes in order for your weapons and characters to be at max power you have to level them up first also leveling your profile takes a huge amount of time.  - certain weapons are mastery locked so in order to craft or even buy them you first have to level up your profile to the required level.  - game can feel like a huge grind especially when playing alone.",

            "review_text": "Warframe is a game that some close friends recommended to me to try out. It's free so I thought 'why not?' I was greeted with a rather hectic and somewhat all over the place tutorial. There was a recent update as of writing this that apparently changed the tutorial for new players and even though I have not seen it, I have good faith the game devs put all the feedback and advice they got in order to change it for the better. The game is a 3rd person shooter, which for me is a real eye catcher. In today's gaming world, most games that want to involve shooting almost all go for the obvious first person perspective. Warframe changes that and I will say that at first it feels a bit awkward to play, over time you get used to it and after a few setting changes, you are ready to go. Now the controls and control mappings are a bit awkward, I have mapped out all the buttons that I need to keys that are somewhat easy and more comfortable for me to reach. It still feels a bit awkward though but I don't have one of those super uber gaming mice that have 10 buttons on it so I can't really blame the game for that. The graphics are alright, I don't really like to judge a game by graphics alone, but although not the best... It's decent. The whole going to different planets and different missions, as well as the ability to play with other players/friends or by yourself is pretty neat. The missions however, are not too exciting. There is several mission types: kill all enemies, collect the maguffin, capture and hold the points, survive waves of enemies till you die or leave, kill boss dude... It's all great... but all the planets have the same types of missions just with different enemies and evironments. It get's a little stale after a while, which can effect the replay value. Speaking of, the replay value is pretty great. You can customize your character, make new characters, new weapons. Its all there, but its a little weak due to having some items (most cosmetic though) cost real money. Making new weapons and blueprints for different characters requires farming and grinding which can turn alot of people off. This 3rd person shooter/rpg mixture has alot of potential, but it is boged down with somewhat over complicated mechanics and tedious farming. Final thoughts... It's not a perfect game, not by a long shot. However, I would not say its a bad game. It's free right now so give it a shot, if you don't like it... then that's fine. If you like it... Then awesome! This game is certainly something that will take most gamers out of their comfort zones, and I appreciate Warframe for doing that.",

I have to say this game is an amazing free to play game with the variety to match every single playstyle and then some more. To be warned there is a ton of grinding but in most games there is going to be a kind of grinding so don't let that discourage you from giving it a try. The best part about this game that everything truly is free to get if you work hard enough, there is no pay to win as it is more of pay to get things faster for gear. The developers truly do listen to us about bugs and complaints. It might take you a while to get a certain warframe you love (I finally got mesa after 600 hours on console and love her) but there will be easy to get ones that you will love to play with. the community is great too if you ever need help leveling or getting used to the game.

You play as the Tenno, who seek the protect the balance. As I got into this game, it was confusing. Unless you check the wiki 24/7, which I did because I'm a nerd that way, you won't understand anything. However, once you get the hold of the mechanics, the game is really fun.  However, the grinding and the cruel RNG does make this game feel repetitive time after time. When you do get burned out, just do something else. Come back in a few months and even weeks and I garuntee you that something new has been added/changed.  Pros:  -Beautiful Graphics -Fluid Motion -F2P completely. Everything is unlockable except for event items (which could have been done for free) and cosmetics -A Dev (Digital Extremes) that actively updates and cares about this game -Just fun  Cons:  -Repetitive at times -Confusing to the new player -And yes, DE is human, so they do make mistakes. These mistakes are usually temporary and will be fixed almost immediately.   Overall, this game is fun and just pure awesome. Like any game, it does have it's cons but the pros heavily cover them up.

            "review_text": "Warframe is a large, multiplayer game in which the player, known as the Tenno, control their warframes to complete missions and tasks, with an overarching goal of restoring order to the system, Taking place over all the planets in the solar system, plus some extra terrestrial bodies such as Ceres and Europa.  The basics of gameplay are fairly easy to understand, where in a very basic level could be played out similar to other shooters. However the Warframe has much greater capabilities, with alot of mobility at their disposal and frame-exclusive abilities which can turn the tide of battle, offering a more skilled level of play in working for synergy between weapons, abilities and mobility options available. This can provide even greater strength with others, as each mission can be completed in a squad of up to four players, which extends to eight for the Trials of the systems, the end-game content so to speak.  The initial arsenal which the Tenno has access to is limited, but different weapons are made ready for construction as you experience the game, with the increase of the Tenno's Mastery Rank (MR). MR is essentially a measurement for how much of the game a certain Tenno has experienced, in which a Tenno of rank 3 has not experienced nearly as much of the game of a Tenno of rank 12, for example. Increasing your MR also unlocks the avaliability of some sections of the game's content, such as weapons, quests and certain areas.  Missions are easy to get into and intially can have significant variance, such as defense, interception and capture missions, and after a short while of gameplay the Tenno can also complete a quest to obtain an Archwing, which can provide a fresh task to undertake.  Community is also rather nice, with many members willing to aid others and there is the ability to join a clan within the game to interact with a smaller community within.  However, the Single biggest flaw for the game is repetition and grinding. Many parts of the game can require grinding for specific materials and blueprints, which often results in returning to missions multiple times, and weapons and warframes require useage in order to gain levels, which adds to this grind. For a player who doesnt mind a grind, this isnt much of a big issue, but many players, myself included, do not enjoy the huge amount of grinding required.  Warframe IS a fun game, and also holds lore which at times can play a significant impact into the game, But the grind which it holds is a significant deterrent for many players in the long run. despite this, I find myself returning time and time again to play, with the updates adding more content to indulge in. It is not a game for everyone in the long run, but by heck it at the very least can provide at least 10 hours of fun for most people.  Plus the game is free. Because it helps bring in players :3",

Going onto the topic of the games virtual currency, Platinum, which can be bought and then either be used to buy stuff from the market or the player auction. DON'T expect to get very far in the player market unless you have platinum to spend or have some damn good mods for your gear. The only downside to the trading aspect is that weapons and a few other things aren't tradable (although I can kind of see why with mastery rank limitations, ect)  Recently Digital Extremes made a new beginners walkthrough so don't miss out on that great tutorial which teaches you some good things to know. The developers keep up with the games development and if something isn't working, it usually gets fixed in about a few days.  Overall this is a damn good game and would recommend anyone looking for a grind.

However this game have a lot of grinding to do like leveling your weapons and frame to rank up and collecting materials by doing the same mission by farming, and other stuff like it. And you have to wait a certain hour to finish a weapon or frame.  The pro is that there is a lot of missions and weapons for you to play with and the best part is the frames where each frame have a different ability to suit your way of playing wether you want to be stealthy or run and gun or even melee every enemy in the game. There is missions where you can get exclusive weapons such as event or alert missions where you can get helmet blueprints or extra credits. You can also have a clan in the game and build a dojo where you can do pvp or make powerful weapons that can only be crafted at the dojo  Now the con is that you are given a really small slot and some platinum which platinum can only be obtained with REAL money where platinum can be used to instantly finish a building progress or buy weapons without having to get the materials (not the prime weapons though) and you must think well before spending your platinum or you will get a problem later on. And one of my problem is the potato's (you will know after playing it) is where it doubles the points for your weapon BUT without a doubt its hard to get the 'potato' as sometime they appear in alert mission while you are asleep or at work. And not to mention the enemies gets harder overtime and the fact that there are different type of enemies which force you to use a different weapon on each faction to get the best results.  In conclusion the game itself represents a great 3rd person mmo where you play as a space ninja but need a lot of grinding which is perfect for people who likes grinding or rpg games. However if you are impatient and a singleplayer player, i would not recommend this for you because in some mission its nearly impossible/hard to solo as this game requires great teamwork and patience since you wont get anything instantly in this game.",

So, if you need it, here's a summary: YOU ARE A MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING NINJA WARLOCK JEDI WITH WICKED MATRIX GUN SKILLS AND YOU CAN PARKOUR LIKE EZIO UADI-♥♥♥♥IN'-TORRE. But seriously, it's free, fun, and worth your time and effort. If you become afraid of Infested Ancient tentacle ♥♥♥♥, the game's also free to uninstall. Happy hunting :D",

Like a sort of gamble, you try to gather materials to craft every weapon out there for your own personal space ninja colection. Huge downside represents the fact that even if you craft or buy every weapon out there, you have no real reason to switch from a handfull of weapons that currently wipe the floor with everything else out there.   Additionally, the game's lack of endgame reminds me of Diablo 3, where you had no real reason to keep playing, other than farming new items and boasting them on a chat with the rest of your friends.  Warframe has a huge potential, however the lack of quick and efficient adaptation is beggining to seem like a big risk in a domain such as the Gaming world, where somebody else may catch up and do a better job at giving the public what they demand.  Overall, the game gives a nice feeling to the casual player where nothing can stand in your way, not even gravity.",

            "review_text": "Warframe is a tactical third person shooter set in a vast and continually expanding universe that is very interesting if you look into it's lore. The game is set on your character, an old tenno warrior who is in an massive suit of armour called a warframe. A warframe is a suit of armour that was placed onto a tenno when they are initaited, and has 4 special abilities and a wide array of advantages such as better shields or armour. You, a lone tenno, was put into cyro-sleep after a great war beetween the sentients and the (as i call them) the orokin people. You wake up centuries later to a unverse filled with corruption, greed and violence and it is up to you and your fellow tenno to restore peace once more to the solar system.  Gameplay wise, the game is built around you doing acrobatics and maneuvers to outsmart your enemies, such as running across a wall to reach an enemy with your shotgun. As you progress through the game you'll find things called 'mods'. These mods are used to augment your warframe and weapons to certain advantages. One example of this is to give a rocket launcher a faster fire rate, or a shotgun more accuracy. Whilst the mods do little to improve your items when you first get them, you can upgrade them with fusion cores or with other duplicates of mods. You can say get a damage mod from the basic %20 increase to a phenominal %200 increase on the max rank. This system works beutifully and works well with the whole concept of you being your own unique character.  The classes in his game are set in what type of warframe you have. There are over 20 warframes currently in the game (the most recent being mesa) and with each one comes a different experience. Your warframe is unique with the abilities and attributes it has. One example is the warframe 'rhino' a beast of a warframe that has high armour, shields and health and a powerful array of abilites that revolve around either taking or dealing damage. Each of your warframes comes with 4 revive tokens which replenish every day to the maximun of 4. This is very useful as solo players will find killing enemies difficult on higher levels.  Apart from your warframe, you will have access to a wide array of primary, secondry and melee weapons. Each catagory has a subclass, which include handcannons, staffs, longswords, rifles and many more. Some of these sub-clasess require different types of mods, such as a well modded rifle set will not work on a shotgun as they are two different weapons types. Same as your warframe you can mod your weapons with a wide array of mods that include increasing damage, to mods that inflict elemental damage or 'status effects'.  There is alot of things that i can talk about but there is just too much to fit in a review. This game is FREE and does not force you to pay and it is fairly easy to farm for resouces and build that all important weapon you've been wanting. This feels satisfying and well achieved and one of the many reasons why a have played warframe for over a year (yes i realise it says i have less than an hour of gametime but i have over 1000 hours on the browser version of the game).  i give this game a 4.5/5 a very well earned score, keep up the great work D.E :D",

            "review_text": "This game is only fun if you are rich. Although it is 'free to play', the action gameplay will become repetitive when you only have the same guns and warframe. To get a new warframe you'll need to spend several days grinding for both material and credits to get the blueprint for what you want to make. Then you'll have to go online to the wikia and find out where to get the ingredients to make the warframe you want. After than grind for the materials to make each piece of the warframe. Once all that is done you can finally craft it, but then you'll need to wait around 72 hours (3 days) for it to be finished crafting and then you can use it. Ofcourse fans of the game say 'go do something else for 72 hours.' 'go get some fresh air'. Well maybe I dont want to get fresh air. I want to play a game for hours and hours. When I put effort into grinding I espect my item to be done not wait 3 days after i've done everything to gather the materials for it. The action gameplay, wall jumping, running, sliding, is great. However the instances, setting, maps are so enclosed and tiny that the wallrunning stuff doesnt really shine. The stealth action in the game isn't fun either. You have to get a certain item to be able to see enemies. If you dont have it, you will have to see enemies by eyes. Sometimes the game will spawn you in front of an enemy when you start your mission thinking 'ill do it stealth'. And as much as you will try to play like a ninja, if you end up in a room and 1 enemy spots you, even though you take that enemy out pretty much all enemies in the surrounding rooms will rush in and destroy you. The tutorials and guides teach you very little about the controls. It teaches nothing about upgrading or forging. There is no way to tell you what mission you should do next. You pretty much have to look at every planet to find your next mission. The game might seem like its free to play, but it will eventually wither away at your mind until you cough up that extra cash for some items. Any fan of the game will tell you that the game shines through its multiple various weapons and warframes with unique abilities, but unless you got an endless bank account or extreme patience this game will not be fun for you. They make everything so incredibly hard to get with no sense of progression that it will force you to open up your wallets or simply uninstall the game. The action gameplay really is just you running and sliding along the ground just because the slide goes faster than the sprint. You'll most likely rarely wallrun, or even take cover. Most missions wont require any thought or strategy, just sprint through them to the goal. Unless it is a defense mission you dont have to kill any of them, but remember the enemy will not forget about you and most likely chase you and horde up until you reach the extraction points. This game doesnt listen to it's community. It only tries to emulate other games rather than being it's own. They care about your wallets rather than the player. I doubt they even spent much time developing it as it seems to just be a simple copy and paste missions disguised by fancy lighting, blooms, and motion blurs. Fans of this game would argue that even though the story and missions are tedious and repetitive and that the fun is from the 'action', remember all of them most likely paid for the items and warframes. If you see them have alot of nice weapons and they tell you they crafted them all, then they are rich in time or they are lying. Youll never experience the 10% of actiony fun that people play this game for unless you have a fat wallet.",

I'm not sure what it is about Destiny, but it just seemed gimmicky and unappealing overall, though I do like the art design quite a bit, but as soon as I loaded up Warframe for the first time (on my PS4), it sank it's Valkyr claws into my soul.  The lore is deep and mysterious, the gameplay is fast and frenetic, and mastering the in-game systems including the wide variety of 'classes' (ie Warframes, of which there are currently 42, what other game has 42 classes to choose from?!) is just endlessly entertaining.   The design elements (from the game mechanics, to the menus, to the sci-fantasy aesthetics) are just super appealing to me, and I like how the game offers little explanation for anything, requiring the player to dig in an investigate if they want to know what's going on. It reminds me more than a little bit of the mystique generated by Dark Souls, my favourite series of all time.  Unlike most f2p games, nearly all of the content is farmable without buying 'Platinum', the in game currency, plus there is a robust WTB market where you can trade rare drops for Platinum, so you could in theory never drop a dime on this game. Personally, I like the grind so far, maybe I'll eat my words end-game, but man, this game really is top notch in every way :D",

From confusing damage types to an also confusing crafting system, it can all seem a little daunting, or discourage a person from playing the game. The thing that upsets me most is that color palettes are locked behind a paywall and the only color palette that comes with the game for free doesn't even include all of the colors in its scheme. Luckily, you are given enough Platinum to buy at least one color palette to make your Warframe look halfway decent.   Platinum is the in-game currency that is used to rush or buy hard to obtain items. But Platinum can only be obtained with real money. A lot of things in game can be grinded out and farmed for. Such as other Warframes, weapons, mods, and companions. It can take a very long time though and rushing or out-right buying things with Platinum is often encouraged. Yes, it is a Free-To-Play game, but like all of the others it will want your money to get into the good features.  There is a lot of content in Warframe. You'll always have something to do, from leveling up weapons and warframes, completing missions and quest, or trading in the chat, you'll easily be able to keep busy.   One other problem that I have with this game is that a lot of the missions and locations are the exact same. They'll often cut off certain parts of the map and have you do a mission that takes place there, but in another mission it's highly likely that you'll end up running through that same area again. But at least there are a lot of different objectives to do on each planet.  Warframe also runs very good. I've had no issues with this game and it is graphically pleasing to the eye. Though the enemies are kind of weird. (Seems like a space take on Alice In Wonderland creatures) It feels solid to play and the controls will have you feeling like a badass in no time.  Ultimately I would recommend Warframe to anyone who has the patience to figure it out. It has a great and very active community so you'll always have people to play with. And the community is quite upbeat and willing to help out. At least give it a try. I mean.....It is free...",

Here's a few things that have been added over the last couple of years. - various environmental tilesets with related mission mutators. - improved pvp modes seperate to pve, including a sport akin to gaelic football. - starmap and mission selection has been revamped again and again. - weapon content,number of playable suits 'classess', enemy diversification and ai has increased considerably. - outerspace and underwater missions - quests seperated from standard missions - events - new tutorial and mission introduction gamplay. - totally free to play - although throwing cash at the shop for ingame currency may improve quality of life and reduce the grind against rng related rewards.

Good fun, light hearted and fully achievable without spending any £££'s.   Ups: variance of skills abilites and weapons, everything lvls with use, starting weak and getting more powerful.  No need to pay $, the free experience is complete. Constant updates and tweaks by devs Good community PVE orientated gamplay. Smooth gameplay  Downs: are the repeative nature of the game, need for grinding to aquire resources and delay in matchmaking for unpopular missions. PVP limited to clan only training.",

So, I have played Warframe for quite some time, on and off for about 4 or so years now.  Since it was announced I supported it, and now as I write this review I have realized that I never regretted it.  I have not played Warframe as much as some, but it has had an impact on what I expect out of many other games.  I can't recommend a free to play game more than I recommend Warframe. It's just fun.  Dynasty Warriors meets Star Wars: Jedi Outcast and had a threesome with Devil May Cry while going to class with an attractive art direction to learn and secretly have an affair with all of these (developing) story points.  Really, if you like action games, try it, it's free. If you like Devil May Cry, do yourself a favor and make this party crazy! Try Warframe. If you enjoyed Jedi Outcasts interesting combination of lightsaber and gun play and third person gameplay, Warframe feels very much like a game I'd been missing. Do you like being a man blender of blood and gore as you spiral through hordes of enemies that peel apart under the force of your advance like wet cardboard to a well forged blade, until you meet the inevitable leader of the cardboard men's group and have a real fight for a while before inevitably coming out as the better, and run off with all the spoils of the battle and victory in your hands?  Yeah, bet you can't tell if I just described Dynasty Warriors or Warframe, can you? Guess what, I'll tell you a secret. (It's both)  Strap on some wonderful RPG style mechanics and a similar card collecting system to upgrade your arsenal and you have a game that I never knew I needed, but I had it from the beginning and it's only now that I realize just how much it means to me.  Warframe is a game you need to try, it's free, it runs VERY well on almost any system in my experience, and it's above all really dang fun.  Get it.",

More abou that the game gives you most of these informations in an in-game CODEX so you don't have to go to the wiki or their website for them (I'm looking at you Destiny).  &lt;Trading&gt; Last but not least there is this trading system in which you can get anything in the game without paying a single dollar.

The main thing why I didn't quit this game is that it's free and if you put in enough effort you can litterally buy anything (except for tennogen stuff which is made to support the creators). I feel that by saying this I have made like a million of 'friends' who wants me to get cancer or smth. To be honest I don't care one bit - I can only tell them to get good and stop whining and ranting. If you don't like it just don't play it. Even though (just like in any other game) there is alot of negative thoughts about Warframe I am very happy to be a part of it's community - to be a Tenno.

I would say warframe is a pay to win game but since you can win everything by grinding I guess it isn't very pay to win, more like pay to win faster.I wouldn't consider it pay to win for other reason which is the fact that you can trade items for platinum (paid currency of the game); Me and my friend gathered around 2000 platinum in a week. 2000 platinum is almost the same as 90$. The only problems I see in this game are when you reach the late game (have almost all the weapons and warframes) you have almost nothing more to do, since the pvp has poor replay value because it is unbalenced and sometimes fustrating and You can get burnned out easly but overall it's a great game.",

It is exactly what Destiny based its gameplay on (hub map, where you select level-oriented missions on planets from a solar system layout, then team up with other players for a run through), but with a much smaller budget and no price to entry for the player (and in my experience, far more variety to game play environments, customization, classes, and so on -- plus ninja swords).  This game may not be for everyone, but it definitely deserves a try. Especially if you have a friend or two to partner up with (though it does pretty well at matchmaking in-game).",

            "review_text": "*This was written during the Specters of the Rails update. Things ARE different in the game after this review. I've fallen in love with this game but this latest update (The Glast Gambit) is making me doubt my love for this brilliant game.  The first thing that I wanna address is the 'pay to win' misconception. No, this game is not pay to win. You can get everything BUT MOST cosmetics for free. You just have to spend a crapton of time to get it. If you are thinking 'COSMETICS MUST B PAYD 4! IS P2W! U SAID IT!' then know that cosmetics do nothing. It just makes you look prettier, maybe, if it falls in-line with your tastes. Getting new stuff can be hard for a new player so look for help online in order to have help at your disposal. Weapons and other useful things take time to get for free and if you pay real money for them then you have only gotten them faster.  Warframe is a free to play game made by Digital Extremes. You play as a Warframe, a war machine ninja thing that can parkour and shoot things and use melee weapons.  The gameplay is the best thing about the game. Using a melee weapon is really fun and gunplay is pretty good. The 'parkour' mechanics are pretty awesome and they can even be really useful if you wanna create a shortcut of some sort. The game also has a bullet time feature... Kinda. You aim your gun in the air, you go slow-motion and you shoot stuff. This can also be used for creating shortcuts if you combine the games parkour maneuvers with the slow-mo bullet time feature in order to reach certain places from a distance.  The story is... Uhh... Um... Do you know the game Destiny? It's like that, kinda. You begin in a place, something finds you and you escape from the bad guys of the game. And then you get a spaceship because why not? The INITIAL story is nothing special. In fact, it's kinda boring. The enemy factions are kinda cool, I guess. The Grineer are the 'barbaric and primitive' faction and the Corpus are the 'rich yet also greedy, technologically advanced' faction. They both use their own futuristic technologies and they are both the bad guys because... Well, they just are. Many other questlines in the game are far more interesting than the first questline (such as Natah and Second Dream) as they expand the lore and the world of Warframe by a margin.  The levels have some variety to them. For example, Mars is a desert planet thing and Earth is a 'nature-has-taken-over-post-apocalyptic-greenery-yay' (and Earth is the worst planet in my opinion due to how generic-looking it is). While the planets have THAT kind of variety, it doesn't mean that they are unique. They are incredibly generic. It's just factories, science stations and the kind of things that you expect from each respective planet in our solar system (the game takes place in our solar system btw). The most unique planet is Uranus in my opinion, as it is a water planet with giant fortresses on top of the ocean surface and you can go underwater or fight on land. Think of this planet as Kamino from Star Wars but with Grineer architecture. Other wonderful looking places in the game include everything related to the Orokin race such as the Orokin Moon, the Void and the Orokin Derelict. Another thing that the levels have going for them is procedurally-generated levels. It sounds AWESOME, right? Well, the rooms just have a swapped order in order to not make the levels repetitive. It works on the better planets of the game but when some planets are too generic, it doesn't work at all.   The graphics are fine enough as they are. They look good. The models are nice, the texture-quality is nice. The game is also well optimised so you can probably run it on a potato, though not with 60 fps at Ultra settings.  The multiplayer aspect of the game is really good in my opinion. You can speak with other players through multiple channels. I'm going to go over the default channels that are always with you: A channel for the region chat where you speak with other players about a lot of different things, a trade chat for marketing an item that you wanna sell or trade and recruit chat for asking other players to join you in a mission or you can join other players if they ask for help. Playing with other people also helps a lot, especially against bosses and 'levels that go on forever'. Since you are more people, the game obviously becomes easier. Hell, you may perhaps find a new friend! Oh, and you can create and/or join clans (!) in the game. I won't be going in-depth into what player clans do but it's basically this: You start a clan, you build your own place and other clan members may contribute to things in your clan home in order to fund construction. You can also do different things in your clan home such as build rooms in order to fight other players for fun, create a platforming room for fun, create useful rooms that allows you to build new weapons and/or just overall build nice looking rooms/decorations. The community is mostly nice. No one has been rude to me as of yet but I have seen people being rude to each other on the region chat multiple times. Lag is also a thing but that depends on you or other players. There are dedicated PvP modes in the game but barely anyone plays PvP.  There are many different mission types, by the way. I won't go over them all but you can bet on it that there are many such as Survival (It's horde mode), Defend (you defend something against waves of enemies), and Exterminate (you kill everything that isn't friendly) just to name a few. Having multiple people on Defend and Interception (capture the flag, pretty much) is recommended, especially on harder levels as it will get overwhelming at times to do these types of missions solo.  The sound effects, sound design and music composition is fine. Music is meh though. Some songs really stand out while others are just generic sounds.  Let's go over the negatives now. The first questline is a thing I've already mentioned. Specters of the Rails did ruin some things for me. While others may think that the 'archwing mode' in the game was still ♥♥♥♥♥ in pre-SotR (SotR stands for Specters of the Rail for those who don't know), I think that it was awesome... until SotR happened. I don't mind the new '360 degrees flying-around' thing as that is cool, but the camera is way too close to the player this time and my eyes hurt when the player moves so fast with the camera so close to him. Bugs are here and there but they are in every game and DE fixes them whenever they can. The game is incredibly grindy. However, SotR did reduce the amount of grinding required for prime stuff but the same can't be said for everything else as you will be grinding a lot. The worst flaw in Warframe is just the overall artstyle and level design. While the Warframes themselves AND their weapons look really awesome, everything can be described with one word: generic. The levels are really bland, the enemies look so boring and while they are fun to kill, they don't do much to you and are just like every other enemy template in shooters ever (except for most of the Infested enemies such as Ancients, Mutated Moas and Juggernauts, the bosses, some of the Corpus enemies such as Moas and Bursas and the Grineer Manics). The levels can look so bland that not even the procedurally-generated systems in the game can help it.  Overall, this game is fun as a multiplayer game with friends. You can solo it but it will take time and skill to do so. I'd give the game a 6 or 7/10. It's good but the game has flaws and the artstyle is too generic for me to love it. Do give this game a try. It may/will be boring in the beginning, as this is one of those games that require you to play many hours in order for the game to really click.",

You play as one of the Tenno and you use a Warframe (there are quite a few, but you get to choose one out of a few for free from the start). You take on various kinds of enemy factions (Grineer, Corpus, Infected) in different kinds of missions given to you by Lotus, more or less the leader of the Tenno, across many planets. You can unlock more planets as you accomplish certain goals. On top of that there is a place called the Void that is quite difficult and requires a key to enter (4 tiers of difficulty). In the void you have the potential to unlock special items only obtainable there that both look better and function better than their normal counterparts. These are 'Prime' items.  The combat is quite good and fast paced, and it's all in third-person. Though fairly straight forward, it isn't necessarily easy. You'll want to move around a lot which can take some getting use to (as a Tenno you can be very acrobatic). You have a health bar and a shield bar, as well as energy which is used up when you use your Warframe's skills.   As you play you gather materials which allow you to build new weapons of which there are many types (primary, secondary, melee, and subtypes of those), as well as companions (sentinels which are floating little weaponized creatures, and kubrow which are a lot like dogs), and new warframes (basically your battlesuit) for you to use, which each have their own unique appearance and skills. There is also something called an archwing that allows you to do an entirely new kind of mission where instead of running around in a ship or on a planet, you can fly though space killing your enemies. Spaaaaaaaaaace.  In addition to building things, you can get a lot of drops called Mods. There is a massive amount of different mods out there. Mods can be used to improve your Warframe, all of your weapons, and your companions. As you level your gear up you can equip more mods. You can also sell mods, fuse many mods into one to increase it's effect (best of the three options), or fuse many mods together to gain one random better mod.   In addition to all of that you can buy quite a few cosmetic things as well. For your Warframe, your weapons, your companions, and even your ship Liset. Your ship Liset is quite important. It's your hub for access to the market, codex, syndicates, foundry, arsenal, and more.  The game allows you to join or create a clan which gives you access to a clan dojo, where you can gain access to many useful things over time (there's even a sentinel, the Djinn, that can only be gained by owning a clan dojo and building a bio-lab). You build various rooms with materials, and anyone in the clan can contribute.  There also are factions you can join that are either broken off from the Grineer, Corpus and Tenno, or are something entirely unrelated to them. These factions are the Steel Meridian, Arbiters of Hexis, Cephalon Suda, The Perrin Sequence, Red Veil, and New Loka. They all have different standings with each other (Allied, Opposed, and Enemy) and you can join as many as you want. By helping them, you can gain special rewards only obtainable through them. However be aware that be helping some, your reputation can go down with others. And by joining syndicates, there is a chance that very difficult enemies can spawn in and attack you. There is also another powerful enemy that has a chance to spawn in and attack you called the Stalker. This enemy is attracted by killing bosses. The more bosses you kill, the more of a chance it has to spawn in future missions.  Great game. Download for free and get your friends in on it.

The game suffers, like most, from grind, repetition, and some lack of guidance. However, the developers continue to work on the game and are attempting to rectify some of these problems. Grind, while awful, is pretty much a cornerstone of a great many games (ARK is worse than WF to be honest). To be fair though, while playing through the game and unlocking new areas I did not find myself severely lacking in resources to build what I wanted. The biggest set back was mostly credits (in game currency), which can be earned by selling some of your acquired goods, completing normal missions, completing extra missions (alerts, invasions, etc), and by trading goods with other users. However, with a helpful clan, you can credit farm pretty easy and overcome this obstacle. Mid to late game, grind will be a bit more of a problem as you strive to attain better items, but for the most part you can get by with what you've got. Repetition is not an issue early or mid game. In fact, repetition is more than likely caused by personal choice. Missions have randomized tilesets, a good variety of enemies (that will vary depending on your location in the starchart), and with multiple ways to play you can get a lot of variety out of the game. However, when you begin to grind for particular items, you'll choose repetition to something new to achieve a goal. By late game, you'll have seen everything, tried everything and run out of things to do. The devs provide events and are constantly making new weapons and frames to try and keep things interesting. They are also discussing changes to the starchart to offer some more randomization to keep the game from becoming dull. Lack of guidance is also being worked on. There is a lot to this game and a lot to learn. If I didn't have a helpful clan, I would have been drowning, but that wasn't the case for me. I can only recommend you ask for some help to learn the game at this point. The devs have stated they will be implementing more missions and guides to showcase parts of the game that are essentially stumbled upon currently.  I've mentioned quite a bit that the developers are working on making things better. This can also be a con. Updates to the game are often riddled with bugs which will eventually be fixed. Some of these bugs can be crippling in game, some of them are minor. What you run into is the luck of the draw.  Overall, I really like the game. It's free, you'll get in a good few hours at least, and it's not pay to win (you can pay to get things earlier if you want and for COSMETIC skins). Also, if you want to buy the premium currency, daily rewards can offer heavy discounts. No need to pay full price, 25% is common, but you can probably hold out for a 75% off and buy quite a bit of premium currency for all your WF desires.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you find yourself a good clan to join. They can help explain where to get what, how to efficiently use items, what you can get rid of and what you should keep, etc.",

The reason I got so wholy sucked into it, though, is that it feels like an amalgamation of a lot of my favorite aspects of gaming; a compelling leveling system, great customization options for gameplay style, reasonable grinding for new equipment and warframes so that each acquisition feels like an exciting accomplishment... The sum of the parts makes the whole incredible.  It's clear that the game is still beta, that's certain, but if it's already at this point in its beta stage and still getting updates, it has a LOT of potential.  HIGHLY reccommended.",

            "review_text": "Cooperative Cyborg Space Ninja Third Person Action RPG. Do I have your attention yet?  Having witnessed the evolution of this game from its infancy I can say that it has grown into a unique peice of gaming that will certainly garner its place in the hearts and minds of people. Coming from just a handful of 'Warframes', this games version of character with pre-made stats, to an abundence such that there is almost always one to suit any playstyle within the third person market.  In terms of graphics it has come a long way. The lighting and animations have come to a crisp smoothness that a lot of other free-to-play titles simply haven't gotten to. The bio-metal, or whatever the suits are made up of look organic but have the deflecting power of metal which makes for an interesting change when you're sliding across a metal surface and hear the suit grinding against the ground.  Combat is almost always fast and fluid with hoards of enemies attempting to do everything in their power from keeping you from your objective with varying enemy types. Going head long into a wave of enemies can be fun, but the unprepared should be ready for a quick death. Finding your niche is easier since there are plenty of people in the community who are willing to pull you along to get the Warframe of your choice by getting you the parts to build it.  Crafting is simple to learn and essencial to maximizing your arsenal as well. Getting the right gun could just be a matter of getting the materials to build it. If it turns out to not be that great, sell it off and craft again until you find that one you're willing to put money down to get a Orokin Catalyst and enhance it further for a fraction of the cost it would have been to purchase the weapon outright. Who knows, you might even find an event and get the Catalyst completely free.  The final and most important element of the game is the mods. These can completely alter the way some of the warframes play out, even some of the weapons get an extra kick. Current personal favorite is the Kunai throwing knives with a 170% chance of an additional shot at the same time. That's right, I get the possibility to throw a third with each toss of a blade and deal massive damage. Finding this kind of combo for your weapon is just a download away.  Enjoy.",

I've really tried to like this game but I just haven't been able to get there, yet, and I find myself going back to Mass Effect 3 (it's a shame Bioware has pretty much blown off it's multiplayer support). I really dislike the fact that you can't earn platinum by just playing the game. Instead you're either required to shell out money or need to grind for ridiculous lengths of time to unlock new stuff.  Regardless, for what it's worth, it's pretty good, especially considering it's free-to-play. If they were to change the purchasing systems and leveling system in the future, I'd most likely donate cash toward it's development.    Addendum (2013/12/13): It's actually a lot of fun. I've been playing the crap out of it the past couple of weeks and, now that I've picked up on the resource farming and have a better idea on the forging, I think it's pretty entertaining.   I still like the overall feel of Mass Effect better but ME has become pretty stagnant compared to the continuous evolution of Warframe. I will continue to dislike the purchasing system and the inability to get new equipment in an acceptable amount of time without paying for it. I also find it appalling that DE put in the option to pay platinum for credits.   All-in-all, fun",

The entire game is a grind, I cant deny that, but the core gameplay of being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ acrobatic robot space ninja with guns is fast paced and fun enough to keep anyone who gets into this game hooked, shooting and killing is fun and feels great, the movement system is fluid and works extremely well with the combat, and just the variety of guns, melee weapons and Warframes means theres something for everyone. Now as I said earlier the game is a grind, but more of what I'd call a farm, cause its always gratifying. One last thing im very happy with is that you can play this game without spending a single cent, while buying the in game premium currency will certainly help you progress quicker and give you more customisation options which are most of the time just aesthetic, you can still get every single weapon and warframe in the game as a complete free to play, despite how it will certainly take you a bit longer, all in all, addicting gameplay with unique and fun weapons and mechanics, with the only drawback being that it isnt very friendly to new users and the grind can be a major detriment to some players, but in my opinion, great game, certainly worth a try.",

            "review_text": "Overall Warframe is a great game. Good graphics, runs well on most PCs, very smooth controls and movement is fluid, the mission types are engaging and keep you wanting to progress further into the game.  People who complain that it's too 'grindy' are missing the point and purpose of what the game is. Warframe is not an open world RPG where you can simply roleplay without putting in any work, the entire point of the game is about fighting and doing missions. It also isn't supposed to be a game where you can get your gear and characters up to max tier within a week. You're meant to spend a lot of time on it to rank up and get the gear that you'd like. While you can straight up buy your stuff with platinum (the currency that you purchase with real life cash), you are not obligated to and you don't have to as almost everything outside of cosmetic items can be built with in game only materials, albeit taking more time to craft.   The devs made a good in game trading interface for players where you can get platinum for items that you acquire with only in-game materials, such as prime gear parts and mods. If you are dedicated and seriously want something that is only obtainable with platinum, you can get it through effort and trading worthy items to other players that would want what you have. It takes time, but if you don't want to spend any cash, you can still work for what you want.  I do recommend playing the game with at least one or more friends though if possible, as it's a lot easier to learn and figure things out with a friend to help you, especially if it's someone who has already played the game before and can help get you a headstart into learning the core game mechanics. Playing solo is still viable though, since there's a huge amount of player-to-player interaction, and you can figure out almost anything you need by just searching through the warframe forums or steam community page.   Onto the actual gameplay and bread 'n butter of the game, everything really flows together really nicely in this game. I'm a huge fan of the movement system, since you can be really agile and parkour around maps, and it's all extremely fluid feeling. All of the warframes are pretty balanced and you can do a decent amount of work with any warframe you choose to use, given that you equip and upgrade proper mods to your gear. Mods are basically just 'boosters' to your weapons and your warframe (Your warframe is basically like your class, btw. Your warframe is what gives you all your abilities and sort of defines what your role is in the game.) and they apply various different perks and bonuses, and you can further ugprade to get even more out of them. The weapons are decently balanced as well, of course the harder you have to work for a weapon and the higher rank it is, the better it'll be, just like any other game, but with proper mods you can turn even low quality weapons into pretty good ones.   Some people say the game gets repetitive, which I could see why people would think that, but it really depends on what kind of person you are and what kind of games you find personally fun. I for one haven't gotten bored of Warframe yet in the 2 or so weeks I've been playing it. Warframe definitely isn't an open world game, but it still has a good community with loads of content to explore and learn about. There are hundreds of different weapons to choose from, so you can always switch up your playstyle and try new things to keep the game fresh. If you go into the game with an open mind and not expecting it to be a f2p version of WoW, you'll have a lot of fun.   If you like to be a perfectionist in games and always want to seek out the best possible outcomes and the strongest gear in a game, Warframe will be awesome for you because you can spend days upon days hunting down the rarest and most powerful weapons and mods to gear up with. With the alert mission system, there's a bit of luck involved with getting the best gear as well, since you may or may not be online while something super good pops up on the alerts, so you may end up having to wait for it to pop up again if you aren't on in time to get it.   All in all, Warframe is a good game, especially since it's totally free to play. It's hard for me to find a real complaint when I'm not in anyway obligated to play the game if I don't want to. The only negative thing I'd have to say is that corpus missions suck. Corpus enemies have a bunch of shields, plus they have flying drones that give even more shields as well as certain enemies who nullify your abilities. They also deal pretty good damage, especially as you go later in the game. If the enemy spots you and triggers the alarm and you don't clear it fast enough, a tank-like enemy called a Bursa will come rushing in and wreck your day, while being pretty hard to kill in most circumstances.   This paragraph is probably going to sound stupid but I just need to comment on it. The single worst part for me is these enemies in corpus missions that I like to call 'turkey legs' (or MOA, which is their actual name.) They are literally just a pair of green mechanical legs with a gun on top. They seriously look like some sort of oversized robotic bird legs running around the place. Their design is so absurdly silly that I can't help but get angry whenever they kill me or when a swarm of them come to attack me with their never ending laser gun attacks. There's also the infested MOA, but at least their design kind of makes sense to some degree since they're actually a living thing and it looks like they got hit with some sort of plague. With the corpus MOAs, I can't help but imagine this stupid picture in my mind of some mad scientist in a lab creating the corpus turkey legs with them flooding off of a conveyor belt thinking the design is super wicked and unstoppable, when in reality it's no joke, just a pair of green legs that shoot at you while looking hilarious running around the map.  Also, the boss fights can get a bit ridiculous at times, since some of them are literally invincible unless you hit them in super specific spots, make them use an ability so that they become vulnerable, or use a specific type of damage against them. The game usually gives very little indication of what to do, aside from Lotus perhaps making a small comment here and there about the boss's general weakness, for the most part you have to either figure it out on your own, or search up how to beat the boss. While not unbeatable, I'd recommend finding someone to bring along with you if you need to do boss fights until you get stronger gear at least. It's usually easy to find someone in the recruitment public chat, so I'd try that if you don't know anyone personally who plays warframe. A lot of people are usually willing to give a helping hand, especially if you're somewhat new.   Anyways, this game is overall very enjoyable, and for being free to play it would never hurt to at least try it for an hour and then just uninstall it if you don't like it.  Highly recommended.",

Destiny has like 3 classes, Warframe has 30 frames with a new one every 3 months. - Pets and Companions. - Ongoing story. - Complex and ever evolving game. - Not 'pay to win' - Space Ninjas. - FREE  Negatives: - It's a bit of a grind VS the frustrating RNG of Destiny - Gameplay not simple and the learning Not User friendly",

The third person shouldercam is a bit weird for me, as I'm used to FPS games, but still a nice change from not being able to see the lower right corner of my screen. The movement system is pretty cool, what with all the parkour, but if you're used to crouching on the fly, you can't do that. If you try, you'll initiate a slide, keeping forward momentum for a few seconds, allowing you to dodge bullets aimed at your Tenno's upper half. However, if you're on a computer with no high-end gaming thingamabobs, the game runs quite slow.  Overall, I give Warframe 7/10, because Windows 7 would probably handle it better than my Windows 10 s***box.  *EDIT* So, I got a PS4 for christmas, and Warframe is free on PS4. Naturally, I downloaded it, and I've got about 10 hours on it there. I hereby update my rating to 10/10.

Gameplay:The gameplay can be either fast pased, low passed, stealthy, shoot-em-up, slasher...you get the point this game is uniqe and can match whatever playstyle you disire Playtime:This game is infinetly long it seems, and there is always somthing to do, wheather it be getting a new weapon, mod, warframe, or trying to beat a boss (not an easy task btw). Multiplayer:easy to access and is encouraged.(though you have to beat the tutorial mission and the mission after that to unlock it) and there is a multiplayer mode called conclave with four game modes: Free for all, team deathmatch, capture the flag, and lunaro(aka football crossed with basketball) Maps:this game takes place across all the planets and some of the moons in our solarsystem and each planet has about 15 missions on them all with their own level design. not to mension that there are derelict orokin spaceships in the void for advanced players to explore and fight in, for a chance to get prime weapons and warframes, along with items essential for building certian things( for example: forma is needed to make rooms and hallways for a clan dojo).Plus a map called: the derilict for those who want to try and defeat the hardest boss in the game and leader of the worst force in the system: Lafantice Enemy's:there are 4 nations in the game, all with about seven or more veriations of there soldiers.

            "review_text": "You now that pleasant feeling when dopamine levels spike up in your prefrontal cortex and striatum? You know, that sense of reward and achievement? Well, Warframe is all about that - sense of illusory achievement in a virtual environment (which game isn't?). Mostly, because you set up goals to get stuff and then you get it. To put it shortly Warframe = farming with guns. But it doesn't mean that it's bad. It's actually very fun.  There's plenty of content. I have 200 hours on record and I still haven't mastered all the gameplay elements and unlocking everything would take me another year or more (since the developers keep updating the game all the time).  Don't be put off that it's F2P, because you can get everything for free (except for skins and extra slots) - it just takes a lot of farming. Warframe is NOT P2W.  So why is Warframe so fun?  - Ninja parkour: wall runs, slides, slide kills, bullet time, zipline kills, double jumps, ground slams...Warframe is a very fast-paced game and offers numerous ways how to kill with style. - Unique abilities for different characters – choose your own 'pokemon' and master it! Wreak havoc and assist your team! -Friendly community - always someone around to help you out on a mission or trade with you. - Clans - build your own dojo - vast customisation and research options – or join others to facilitate your progress through cooperation - Tons of weapons, mods, sentinels/kubrows (pet or machine assistants) and warframes (suits) – most of the time you spend farming and upgrading stuff - Your own ship - place where you build stuff - Relays - places where you meet other players, trade for prime stuff, interact with syndicates (earning standing points unlock useful stuff) - Archwing missions - Star Wars like shooting in the outer space!! (How cool is that?!) - Quests - special missions with story and special rewards - Various type of missions - plan your next step according to your desires or goals; there's enough to choose from, so that you don't feel bored - Cool and challenging bosses - special reward drops and a bit of 'story' that freshens up the farming experience - Feeling of being a total badass hacking, slashing and shooting enemies across the Solar System  There are some cons though, too:  - Paid content is too expensive without discount (I recommend to wait for random 75% discount on daily login rewards and to spend platinum on slots, orokin reactors/catalysts and formas (although you can build the latter three from rare BPs) - Extra slots cost money (understandable) and there's a certain pressure to purchase it, otherwise you can't build a nice arsenal - Farming is long (although it's understandable, why would otherwise people would be motivated to buy something) - Most other players rush out through the missions - which is kind of bad, if you want more time for looting - Don't like the Forma thing for polarity change - you reset your rank to zero and start all over again just to have extra space for mods - Gamepad is not fully supported (some things don't work) - Solo is not possible for all missions - some are just too hard  Anyway, Warframe is a fun and addictive game. The best F2P game ever!  My overall rating: 9/10",

That is, however, dependant on your viewpoints regarding both third person shooters and also science fiction themes. It also may require a bit of patience, so if that's not your thing, or you can't enjoy something for the sake of enjoyment, please, try something else.  Warframe is at core, somewhat of a grindfest at current, but for some people (myself included), this can be made fun with a little imagination, and a simple appreciation of the way the game handles and looks. You play as a Warframe, whom is tasked with various objectives and goals in missions that you select from a series of nodes you unlock as you progress across a map of our galaxy. These range from Capture - wherein you chase down, and kill and then absorb a capture target, before extracting whilst being shot at by mutlitudes of enemies - to things like Survival and Defense, which involve trying to keep your life support system above 0% by slaying foes and collecting the life capsules they drop and defending a Warframe pod that contains a cryo-frozen Warframe soldier inside respectively. There are more missions, which I will not go into detail about, but they can all prove fun.  The game is primarily free to play, although has a micro-transaction system in place that allows boosters, weapons and Warframes themselves to bought outright. This balances out toward people who dislike grinding to achieve things. The only things I would consider pay-to-win (and they aren't truly, as they can still be attained - though rarely - freely through alerts), are Orokin Catalysts and Orokin Reactors. These items are one-time use, and boost a weapon or Warframe's modification capacity respectively, allowing you to change and add more to the ojbect in order to increase its power or to make even cooler builds.  The game up to this point was not entirely user-friendly, and much of its mechanics and nuances had to be learnt via friends or guides, or just by simply asking in game, but recently a new addition - the Codex - was added to the main menu UI that allows tutorials to be accessed freely. So that's cool.  Now onto the cool part, the Warframes. They appear as exo-suits or armour that encompasses a person, and they grant mysterious and awesome powers that pertain to each different frame. Volt, for instance, has abilities that let him control and manipulate electricity in the level, killing enemies and shielding allies with it. He is just one of plenty unique frames and all are acquirable for free. Your only restraint will be slots in your inventory to hold these frames (and weapons too), though this can be increased via buying platinum - the paid currency (or trading for paltinum, if you find a rare item).  Story is a bit limited at the moment, and so is the end-game. But this has been slated for fixation by the end of this year, or even earlier.  To conclude, Warframe is cool.",

            "review_text": "As of 7-13-16 (Specters of the Rail update), the void system has been revamped to reduce RNG and as such, grind. Some parts of this review may no longer be relevant.   Warframe as a whole is really a big hit or miss; it will appeal to certain players, but feel lackluster and repetitive for others. There's no denying that Warframe could very easily be called 'Grindframe' and nobody would bat an eye, because it's really what you'll be doing the entire time you play as you progress. MMORPG players will be used to this kind of environment, and will likely enjoy this game a lot due to it's fantastic graphics, character design, customization options, and it's overall true F2P nature.  Once you clear most of the missions on your starmap as a beginner, you'll set your sights on larger prizes, such as Prime weapons and Warframes (basically cooler looking, better attributed items) which can only be acquired in an exclusive zone on the starmap called the Void, which is only accesible through one-time use Void Keys. These keys can be found during regular missions if you largely surpass the 'standard' or 'regular' threshold for either time limit or extra objectives. After you first start to do Void missions, you'll slowly start to realize that in order to actually get some of the cool gear that other players are running around with, you'll need to grind these missions a lot in order to get anything worthwhile. For each Prime item, you'll need a set of usually four components, which includes the weapon blueprint, which all need to be found seperately through random chance following the completion of a void mission. This random chance is usually very very slight in favor of certain components needed to complete an item, which only further encourages the need to farm the same mission over and over until you finally do acquire the item you're looking for. After that, you need to craft each component for a 12 hour time span, after which you then need to craft the ACTUAL item which takes another three days (I should note that these crafting times only apply to Prime Warframes). My point is, as most of endgame entirely revolves around this formula, a lot of players might get turned off early and stop playing this game altogether because of how tedious things might seem at first, and how tedious things start to become as they level up.  The game isn't very beginner friendly either. The tutorial is succinct and over in a flash, consisting only of one mission after which you'll be on your own. It really only shows you the basics of combat and movement, but not anything else. The problem is, there's a TON more content that you'll be left in the dark with, considering how there is virtually zero explanation for anything past ingame combat. There are tutorials available in the Codex in your ship, but new players likely won't discover this if they don't poke around a little by themselves. And again, these tutorials don't explain any of the real meat of this game, of which experienced players had to learn by themselves and grow the love the game based on the things you don't know after first starting. For new players, looking up a video on Warframe basics is highly recommended before uninstalling due to complexity or simple intimidation of the whole ordeal.  Sorry about the jumbled up review, just had a lot on my mind to clear before giving my personal opinion of the game and if I recommend it or not. Like I said, Warframe is really a huge hit or miss. Some people will love it, others hate it, others won't give it a chance and really see what's at the heart of this game before simply quitting. It's a truly F2P game, meaning absolutely ANYTHING can be acquired without using real money, all depening on how much time you're willing to grind (everything leads back to that...). All the brilliant cosmetic options, Warframe selection, weapon selection, ship customization and selection, all of it can be granted through simply playing the game and earning them through trading with other players (again, which is an aspect that is also ENTIRELY foreign to new players, and is downright intimidating for your first 50 or so hours).  In conclusion, I would definitely recommend you check this game out. Considering it's free, there's no harm is installing it just to see if you like it or not, as this game is NOT for everybody. Those without patience or willingness to learn more about the game, or simply don't enjoy the repetitive although fun gameplay will very likely not enjoy this game at all. I for one love this game because of it's brilliant graphics, it's arguably expansive lore and universe, it's awesome sci-fi ninja setting, and it's fast and exciting gameplay.",

The concepts where there but they needed some improvements. Now it's really smooth, with a lot of content and tons of updates every month or so. Dont be fooled because it's free to play, you can get everything (except most of the cosmetics) for free, that is, by grinding. Though it can get a bit repetitive i always find myself coming back (probably because of the content they keep adding)  Talkin' about updates: 'Another one, and another one'  They're like that, one after the other almost non stop, new warframes, weapons, cosmetics, quests and missions added on all of them, constant bug fixes and hotfixes. The dev team is really caring about the community and the game. Honestly, the game has so much content that i would be sitting writing this all day so go on and get it!  TL;DR Just get it, it's freakin' free!!!11ONE!1. If you can get past the grinding then you'll have hours and hours of fun and the game is not even finished yet.

Honestly, this is a fantastic free-to-play third person shooter with emphasis on exploiting Warframe Abilities and maneuveres to outgun, outrun or outlast your enemies. The movement is crazy at first, but once you master it, you are near untouchable. An assortment of weapons and warframes allows you to invent many ways to kill your enemies. Crush their bones. Eat them and make sand puppies. Turn them into KFC. Drown them. Trip them. Suck them into a black hole. Divorce limbs from bodies. The sound of Dubstep. The killer of the disco.   The only downside is that nerf axes usually hurt, namely those who are butt hurt about them (don't look for trouble in the forums). And the fact that RNGsus isn't your friend... sometimes.

I have put over 300 hours into Waframe and unlocked almost every frame and I 'SELL ALL DA THINGS' to pay for slots and taters. After all this time, and monetary investment I regret ever playing this game. Update after update the developers seem to nerf the frames into oblivion and to create ever more ways to make you want to, and need to, pay to advance further in the game. The game is already 'capped' based solely on the difficulty of various missions when playing solo so when you include the lack of useful mods, potatoes, and a clan this game is purely pay-to-win. At least half of the community is made of new to relatively new players who lack the things I previously mentioned and are forced to grind in the worst way possible, alone and without any guidance. I had a clan when I first started and they did what they could for me, even still I was unable to meet the skill requirements for end game missions as a mastery rank 16. I didn't have any primed mods. I didn't have any sentinals, kubrows, or even regular rare mods for damage (elemental/critical). I could not earn or find these mods in game alone, and the clan was busy helping very new players. After all this time and effort what do I have to show for it? Nothing. Just a lot of wasted time and a headache from grinding for 5 hours for simple neurodes, to make a weak and un-potatoed gun and frames. Keep it up DE with all of this nerfing and driving off paying customers like me, you'll be the ones getting shafted next.",

I spent 15$ on the game in may to acquire 2 new warframes, misc blueprints and a nikana prime. I can say my money was spent in vain.

Take this paragraph with a grain of salt as i only had watched 1 entire stream, as I needed to see it to get more experience with the community.  without friends or a guide this game is above all an average single player game that feels more at home to a chinese rip off of halo with more microtransactions then your wallet can handle if you are THAT inexperienced with the pseudo mmo genre. Don't spend money on this game unless you watch videos on trading and that like tf2 it has an ingame economy that based on platinum the money is worth less trading than spending on an overpriced store.  My absolute largest gripe with this game is its latest updates, balancing, interface changes, graphical issues, thankfully all game breaking bugs i've came across that would need me to restart the game were fixed, but ultimately the game getting rid of draco as i left the sinking ship not only fills me with the hope that i see this game's golden age die in a viking funeral.

Up to 4 players against different kind of enemies in different landscapes and situations. It has elements of card-games when modding the weapons (like RPG-elements). The steering of the character is a challange at first, but based on the speed, when you got it, its fun like a racing-game. Players who are more active are rewarded with higher levels in characters and weapons, but those levels are limited at 30, so new players arent disadvanteged too much and are able to catch up soon. Everyone can get the character (Warframe) and the weapons which fit best to their very personal fighting-style. There is a possibility to spend money, but not needed at all.  Asssasination, Defense, Extinction, Rescue, and so on are just some of the level-objectives in the 200something levels.  Fast actions, fast movements, great team-tactics and a well-thought weapon-damage-system makes this game a great fun-trip every time.  Get into the universe and we might play together soon.....",

Second, since the trading system's implementation, there is literally nothing in the game that you can't get as a f2p player (which I am). Paying helps, but hard work will get you farther than any amount of cash.  In terms of originality, it seems like the developers had never played another video game in their lives. It's often hard to find games that aren't influenced by Star Wars, Halo, or other successful franchises these days, but this is one of those few.  Overall, great game, and I wish more games were like this.",

I played in an area that was so bright I had to take a headache pill when I finished.  You never know when jumping somewhere will put you out of bounds and reset your position. Sometimes you need to take five mile drops, sometimes stepping in ankle deep water isn't okay. This game loves parkour so not knowing where you can land is unacceptable.  The cash shop is constantly in your face. So much so tha it makes finding noncash-shop things difficult. Inventory slots are limited to basically nothing,and you will pretty much need to buy more to advance.  The game is very restrictive from the outset, and doesn't open up easily. Tutorials are largely terrible and poorly laid out, and tend to overcomplicate simple things.  There's some fun stuff hiding in it, but it's all very much a pain to access, and there's so many poor design choices, I doubt I would ever really recommend this game.

I'm now a Warframe addict. But, I don't mind, the gameplay is amazing, and the lore is well thought. Long ago, I would have said, don't play warframe, its a very plain game without good elements, but DE studios... They really are doing something right here, right now. Warframe is awesome. Best part is, around everymonth there is an update, adding unique weapons, and usually a new, different and complex warframe (character to play as). You have weapons like tonfa's to blade and whips the standard pistol to a radiation device. (Raidiation emmiter? it creates deadly beam of radiation) and the standard assault rifle to a infected zombie gun that shoots lasers. FRIGGIN LASERS. (its called the Phage)  ... I personally cannot think of any real downsides... oh wait! theres towns of awesome particles effects so if your using a really bad computer (like one that literally cannot play simple games like minecraft) dont get the game. If you have modern technology, I highly recomend this and I think its worth your time. I've played warframe for a long time. I've been there since the begining, and the game has grown. It has grown into something amazing. And the community has to. Heck, why are you still reading this review, go make YOUR OWN DECISION. I think its great. If you just want to shoot stuff, play call of duty. If u just want a sci fi adventure play... uhh... I don't know XD BUT, If you want a game you can play and enjoy for a long time (3 years to a decade) that has sci fi, dazzleing graphics, and a deep complex lore, that literally is like Kim K's butt (it wont stop getting bigger), I recomend this game to you. seriously. Try it the game is free. Oh yeah, did I mention, THAT YOU CAN LITERALLY HAVE AS MUCH STUFF AS A PAYING MEMBER CAN?  If u just want a free game that isnt pay-to-win, my friend, you have found an amazing game. There is a rading system, so you can trade hard-to-get-items that you dont want for the premium currency (platinum) so you can get what you want. Seriously, give warframe a try. It may seem a little plain at first. But it only gets better. Wait till' you reach the endgame. Basically, when you reach endgame, you reach a new game. By that I mean more missions, access to better events, and other things. GO PLAY WARFRAME!",

Its gameplay is absolutely stellar, being the most fluid yet connected movement I've ever seen in a game. Yes, it does have a market. However, everything that you buy in the market, you can also craft or find. As for graphics, at the max settings, the graphics are beautiful. Maybe not up to par with a few of the most recent games, but still, amazing. The gunplay feels solid, because if you try to go it alone without the know-how, your little puny @$$ is dead. However, if you've learned the advanced stuff, and you have skill, you can do plenty of missions alone. I've completed 4 entire planets all by myself, so you can also do so if you put the work in. It may get a bit repetitive at times, but the environments are beautiful. The game always offers new missions to players, like an infestation outbreak on Jupiter, or some 'faction war' between the Grineer and Corpus on Earth that you must end by eliminating every enemy there. Keep in mind, if it gets repetitive, it's not as repetitive as that CoD sh!t, because the maps in this game are procedurally generated (randomized). Also, the community isn't even close to as toxic as other games (lookin at you, CoD). In conclusion, I think Warframe is a really kick@$$ game, and hope to see you in-game soon!",

Mods further enhance playstyle to the very elements you want to fire out of your gun! While it is a grind, after that first loadout is bought and you have a new melee, primary, and secondary weapon, it becomes a game of using awesome mods and unique effects for each gun to mow down hundreds of enemies in different ways, using abilities let's you master the flow of combat. Another thing great about this game is the animations, while they are triggered by player use on some, which can be a bit sudden, all animations look so smooth, and each weapon even has unique combos, stealth kills, finishers, and so on. I would highly recommend this game to anyone, and it's FTP, but not necessarily PTW, the developers themselves said that everything in the game (besides color packs and Excalibur Prime, the donator frame) is obtainable for free. Grinding to get a new weapon can be fun with friends, and the combat is so satisfying most of the time.",

But the grind is action packed, fun, and filled with tense moments of doubt. These challenges are overcome with skill and teamwork. This game is one of my favorite team/solo games. The missions have elements of CTF, Survival, Escort, Espionage and Exterminate/Assassinate, depending on the mission parameters. The different worlds offer variety, and the Archframe missions are a wanna-be mecha pilots joy.  Pro's- -Amazing graphics, killing in space never looked so glorious! -Fast paced gameplay, and fairly quick missions. Good for small or large time kill. -Highly customizable gear by modding makes each player pretty unique. -The boss fights are always a blast! -Great community, join a guild right off for help and support! Teamwork is fun! -Easy to pick up, takes some time and skill to master all the game has to offer. -PvP is brutal, but I suspect once you get good at it a lot of fun. -Space Ninja Mecha-madness!  Cons- -Try to avoid running the same mission/world over and over, it can feel stale even while your reaping rewards. Take advantage of the large variety of mission types and settings! -Avoid buying gear from the Marketplace, the player Trade channel often has the same (or better) items for much, much less!",

I have about 400 hours on steam for this game but on Warframe itself i have 600 because I got the game not on steam. This game can become very dry. Without new content this game becomes a desert. Not much you can do if you have done everything. The developers take long time with the updates few months for them to start making new content. The main reason why this game is not good because it lacks new daily content but the time i have played i have really enjoyed it.",

Nobody mentions that you can't start another character if you pick the wrong warframe. You're stuck with that one until you're able to crafe another one.  The same is true with the weapons. The first mission makes it seem like you can pick up and use any weapon you come across, but once you end that mission you won't find anymore lying around. You can't even craft the basic types (bow, rifle, so on) for several hours.  Not a bad game, but the gamepad controls aren't very good and it's easy to think you're in for something quite different than what it really is.",

You start out by choosing one of three Warframes and your end-game goal is to obtain all the frames; however, player based goals may vary for example you might want to reach the highest Mastery Rank or become pro at PvP. Warframe consists of Quests, over 300 missions, daily missions, 8-player Trials, PvP, Archwing, Operations, Seasonal events, Randomized Alert missions, and much more. Warframes customization is on point! The community is very involved with active forums, Steam Workshop, Player livestreams, DEV livestreams. I must also include that the graphics and performace on Warfame is amazing! You can max out all the settings on even old GPU's and the graphics are amazing and also include Nvidia PhysX. As I've first started playing Warframe in November 2013 and I'm a active player I highly recommend this Game to you Tenno!",

            "review_text": "I just can't do it anymore.   I formerly had a maximum-length review where I recommended this game with some caveats. I still do, but it's too difficult for me to justify its worth at the end of a regular grind session at this time. Don't get me wrong, I spent 50 bucks in support, and I don't particularly regret it, but at the end of the day you have to ask if you're further than where you were. For Warframe, the answer is 'No' on a lot of those days.   Warframe is a space-ninja futuristic third-person mmo. I could spend (and already have) a lot of time talking about its various systems, good things and bad, but only a few actually matter.   You have to be in a very special mindset in order for this game to not drive you crazy. If you want a game you can 'just play', solo or with friends while smashing dumb enemies, this one will last you for awhile, like it did me. If you want to have a life, or have your time respected, or even just grind out while listening to music and not be harassed by poor design decisions or game-breaking bugs, this game is not for you. In fact, if you want to accomplish or acquire something specific within a period of hours, the game does its absolute best to make you hate its fu*king guts, and it WILL succeed.   The inventory space is the price for free-to-play in this instance. You can buy plat like I did, or trade items for plat in-game. You DON'T need to spend real money. There had to be a paywall somewhere, and this is it. There is no auction house, and you can't interact with chat during a mission, so if you want to sell items you have to be prepared to sit in Trade chat for an unknown length of time with nothing to do. This system is terrible and, of course, done this way on purpose.   Leveling is comprised of getting different frames and weapons up to 30, then building or grinding out more of them and doing it again. Doing so will unlock more weapons you can equip, and the occasional quest. It's not a terrible idea, unfortunately it makes you spend a LOT of your play time using equipment that you don't particularly want to use. Not only that, because the modding capacity depends on level, as well as a frame's stats, the game relegates you most of the time to content you've already done because you wouldn't survive the content you're actually ON.   Being an MMO, it's a pretty serious grind. A lot of it is forgivable, but the relic system (where almost all the really good items are) totally destroys the sense of progression in the game. Let's say you want one of these items. Every relic opened drops one of five. Some items drop on multiple relics, but not always. Having already done the research beforehand, you find a mission where you can farm the relic you need, and what you want turns out to be a rare drop from that relic.   You might get a relic. Depending on the mission type, a relic is, or is not a guaranteed drop. This, I might add, has been ninja-nerfed several times. Let's say you need a Lith relic, there are currently six of those in circulation. Assuming you picked one of the few mission types left with a guaranteed drop, you have theoretically a one in six chance of getting the relic you need. The mission may take anywhere from 5-30 minutes depending on its difficulty, type, and your gear.   So you got the relic you need after running 1-6+ missions. Now you need to refine it with void traces. These drop from Fissure missions where you normally break open the relics. Their drop rate seems to range from 10-29. You're going to wind up running four to eight of these missions generally, at 15+ minutes a piece, to get 100 void traces. This will increase your desired item's drop rate to a whopping 10%. You run one more mission to break open the relic, annnnd....   You didn't get the item you wanted. ♥♥♥♥ you, now start the process over again.   Now, I'll be honest, maybe you're lucky and get it within five tries. Or if you break it open with other people on the mission, you can choose from their reward table as well. Or you can go over thirty tries like I have for one particular blueprint and still not get it. Personally, my problem with this system isn't that it takes awhile, it's that you can spend hours and have nothing but garbage to show for it. The system brutally punishes you for doing this by yourself, and the ability to solo was one of the things I originally liked about the game.  RNG isn't the only thing that kills the experience. Alerts usually give awful rewards, but some of them per day give resources or mods that are nearly (or entirely) impossible to get otherwise. Your time is not your own if you're any kind of serious about progressing in the game, and many have taken to keeping webpages or phone apps open that keep them informed when certain items are available.   Stealth exists, but for a game about ninjas, the AI is utterly moronic and makes stealth runs thoroughly boring. This is aside from the fact that it's not possible to take a stealth approach on certain mission types.  And then there are times when, somehow, the game or its devs love to troll the ♥♥♥♥ out of you, or so it seems. Maybe you get sent to scan a vital mission enemy and he spawned in a wall somewhere. Maybe you start an excavation mission and your mission objective never shows up, forcing you to abort. I once did a special alert set on Venus, where the recommended level was 3~18. During that mission, not one but SEVERAL bosses from Neptune showed up, upwards of the level 40 range. Perhaps there's a mission timer that you were unaware of and it just runs out, regardless of whether or not you see a countdown. Maybe the infamous Scorch enemy burns you through the go*damn walls without even knowing you're there, reducing your health to zero before you even notice what's happening. Sometimes it's a bug, but many times it's a decision that was made on purpose to either make things take longer, or create an unnatural difficulty spike.  The game has a special chubby for invincible enemies, for lazy design purposes. Maybe you afk for a minute and come back locked into a room with four nigh-invincible robots. Maybe you're leveling new weapons and frames, and during a messy fight the nigh-invincible Stalker shows up to assassinate you for a boss you killed weeks ago, while becoming immune to whatever four types of damage you inflict upon him at different intervals. Or perhaps several nullifiers and ancient healers spawn close together, necessitating melee combat while an entire crowd of invincible enemies hoses you with gunfire. Or maybe a boss is outright invincible unless you shoot a questionable hitbox. I've been gaming for 31 years, and I know bad hitboxes when I see them.   There's a lot of good in the game that I didn't talk about, and a few of my complaints are subjective according to gear, or mods. It's just too damn bad there are so many hours where you just spin your wheels with nothing to show for it, no matter how efficiently you plan your play-time, and it seems like you're fighting the dev's decisions at every turn. I don't need to 'beat' the game, it's just not engaging enough after a certain point to justify the time it demands from you.",

Once you have completed every mission type 10-15 times, you know what you are in for the rest of game.  The developers, Digital Extremes, have no cohesive vision for the game's future. Content patches include needlessly redundant features, and uninspired weapons that work in uninspiring ways. They are also rife with new bugs, and poorly balanced. An example would be their much awaited Archwing updated, which introduces a new game-mode that is practically standalone from the rest of the game. There is a massive time gate for even the highest-level players, unless you pay real money, and then once built you must find and then level-up 'mods' associated with it and nothing else. The Kubrow update worked the same way.   What initially attracted me to the game was it's art direction and pace, but ultimately it's just not enough to keep me slogging through the same missions with almost zero context behind the effects of each one.   Don't fall for the freemium trap, avoid this game.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing. :) enjoy your Delicious pie :3",

The entire point of the game is to go to x location and kill y number of enemies, or survive for a specific amount of time. It seems fun at first because the game has great movement mechanics, but then you eventually get to the point where you question why you are playing the game. There is no real point to it. Often finding myself waiting to craft items in order to just level my frame or weapon makes it just really boring. That is what the game comes down to. Grinding in order to get the items you want or leveling up a warframe or weapon, or waiting to craft the item you want.  Then theres also microtransactions. That is the reason for waiting to craft your items. Because the game is F2P there are always going to be microtransactions but it's just an insult to the game. Around every corner they offer ways to buy things with their currency. Want a cape? Platinum. Want any accessories? Platinum. Want to not wait 3 days to craft a warframe? Platinum. Everything in this game is trying to nudge you to buy their currency. Although it can be written off that you can get platinum by trading with other players, but in order to get decent items to trade with other players you have to do the only objective of the game, grinding.  The entire game is just grinding. Some things make sense such as to level up a weapon or a warframe. But when you are grinding to no end to no goal what is the point? You can only level up the same warframe so many times, or weapons so many times before it gets boring. Although there is a large variety of ways to play with different weapons and warframes, a lot of it requires paying through their currency. There are a few slots you can have for free brefore you have to start paying for more slots. And that is the extent of the content. Leveling over and over again. Mowing down hundreds of enemies in a level hoping you get the item you want from it. Although there are diffeent mission types some of them are just dumb. Like having to survive 30 minutes for a chance of the drop you want, and then waiting another 30 minutes for another chance. And continuing that same process again and again. That may just be an over simpification of one of the mission types, but that is what the game comes down to. Just killing enemies over and over again. The game is just a timesink.   Overall the game seems nice at first but it very easily can get boring and extremely repetitive. It just isnt as much of a game as it seems to be. Sure there seems to be a lot of content, but when it is just the same thing in a different area it makes you think, why am I playing this?",

Last week, I saw it just staring at me, and I told a couple of friends, 'Hey, why not give it another go?' And just like that we gave it another try. I was amazed on how much has changed about this game. I found the singleplayer story stuff kind of pointless and sometimes a nuisance, I enjoyed playing and toying around in your own personal ship, and definitely enjoyed how I many warframes were added. There are still some flaws like grinding, confusing ♥♥♥ menu (menu back then was so much more simpler), and the singleplayer stuff.

It only took me a few hours before I realized 'Oh balls, this game is a massive grindfest, isn't it?'   I don't recommend this game if you're the kind of peson who isn't up for grinding the same missions over and over again to try and earn something rather than buy it outright. Unless you REALLY like the gameplay or are willing to spend real money to entirely bypass the grind, this will probably get stale quickly.  To get anything in this game you need to either spend a disproportionately large amount of time grinding the same missions over and over for the resources you need to craft something, or break out that wallet and get anything immediately. Once I got enough credits, I went to the marketplace, and after I'd managed to get through all the pages of stuff that wants me to spend the premium currency on, I found where I could get stuff I earned with in game cash. I decided at this point I wanted a new secondary weapon. While I could afford any of the weapons available at my level, I couldn't craft any of them because they all required either resources I couldn't get anywhere, or required me to have other weapons already that weren't even for sale.   So screw it, I thought. I'll try one of the other warframes. I wanna try out Volt. Oh, they don't even sell it? Well, how about Ember? So I bought the blueprint for Ember, and then I needed all the parts of Ember which after looking up how to get them online, saw none of them were available to me either. But if I crack out my wallet I could have any gun available for my rank, and any warframe immediately. I would be fine with this if buying something wasn't so disproportionate to the amount of time needed to spend on it if you don't pay for it.  I might play this game some more if I have a little time and just want to kill a lot of things as a super cool space ninja. But I'm not going to be putting in the effort to actually work towards anything. In my own personal opinion, it's too grindy and repetitive for it to be worth the payoff.",

He goes and gets something to eat so I go do a mission with their new map setups, some changes to make maps completely useless and make this game grindier, but whatever. Thats fine.  I go into a mobile defense with my frost. I then basically got one shotted, then changed frames to a much tankier frame. Had a full build for tanking some damage, yet got two shotted. Legit. My problems with this game stems from their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'balance' changes. There is plenty of bugs I ran into as well, its just a buggy unbalanced mess and it always has been.  Seriously if you want to go play a game just play something else. Go play minesweeper or something. Its much more worth your time.",

        {
            "review_text": "With 45 hours (so far) i can say fairly that this game is one of the best (in my opinion) for 3 reasons.  (1) STORY: I know quite a few MMO's nowadays try to input a story in their games that directly revolve around a single player instead of a faction of players, and most fail at it. Warframe on the other hand has a story that fits well around the player, and if you like the 'faction' story type then you should know Warframe also has those with pretty much every update.  (2) VISUALS: I know next gen games are coming up with more and more realistic looking games, but the problem with that is not a lot of people have a gaming rig that can support the amount of RAM and CPU/GPU that it eats. Personally i have 6GB RAM and a 2.7GH CPU and i can run this on Ultra with not even a spike in FPS.   (3) GAMEPLAY: Not long ago when you told me to play an MMO for the gameplay i would think back al those WoW players and the Horridly boring gameplay it has. Now I have seen the light which shines the letters 'NOT AL MMO'S ARE BORING AS HELL.' and I'm not going to describe the Fighting and other gameplay because it would take to long, so if you're really interested in looking at it before you download go watch a clip of the gameplay and you'll see what i mean.  but i'm a hard critc too, so here is the things i do not like.  (1) MICRO-TRANSACTIONS: It seems to get anything potent with out have to wait weeks to a months to build equipment and the such you have to buy the equipment with MT or rush the building process with MT.  (2) THE WAIT: Although everybody whose become a vet of this game claims that if you play long enough you'll never have to make a Micro transaction, but thats crap because with every update brings a new ship or a new frame you'll have to wait months before the devs decide to put the blueprints to build them on the market.  Really those are my good points and bad point on the game.  So my rating is - 8.5/10",
            "review_score": "1"
        },
        {
            "review_text": "This game's not bad, and I DON'T hate it. That said let's move to cons and pros  CONS:  It's free so they make up for this by demanding either the player grinds like a MF to unlock new gear (armor, weps, etc), or of course pay up real money for such assets. What killed this game for me was this point, because I personally got bored with grinding with the same gear in a game which has such a plethora of interesting gear (so alluring from the marketplace!). Now if you don't/can't pay then grinding with a team or clan can definitely speed up the process and is almost required if you want to get gear in a timely manner - relatively speaking, it's still not super fast or anything. However if you're like me and just want to play this game casually with a friend or two then this means essentially never getting any new gear.   PROS: I liked this game for the time I played it, I really did. the mechanics of it are smooth and fluid, you feel like a total badass space-ninja, I mean that in itself is a great start. The combat is fun, which for how much grinding the game demands of you it NEEDS TO BE. And the gear in the game like I said is very unique and there's a lot of it. And of course it's multiplayer which is almost always a plus.   CONCLUSION: In the end I can't recommend it because I feel like I can't fully (hell not even close to fully) enjoy the game and have to miss out on experiencing much of what the game has to offer because my play style isn't compatible with this game. That lays out the biggest pros and cons I experienced, your experience will probably be a little different, but if you can't see your play style (or wallet) fitting into the mold this game has, then it might not be for you.",

The devs for this game are dedicated and are quite consistent in updates and more free content. I know a few people are put off by the phrase 'Free-to-play' nowadays and for a lot of games that repulsion is justified. However Warframe has a pretty decent business model, you can buy weapons straight out with the premium currency - platinum, but you can also buy the blueprints for the same weapons for a reasonable amount of credits. The mechanics for this game are also fluid and consistent, I have not had too many problems in the way of bugs or glitches, and as someone who generally does not enjoy third person shooters, this one manages to keep me coming back for more. Partly resoponsible for that is the whole aesthetic of the game, the maps are a bit same-y but the whole space ninja thing is pretty awesome just as a concept and the look and feel of the abilities and weapons really fit it well.

The new version adds many different kinds of missions like Alerts which are basically special missions that have special rewards/loot that you pick up at the end of the mission (such as; Extra Credits - in-game currency, cosmetic items that are normally paid for via premium currency - platinum, and resources to build weapons and different Warframes).  Warframe is essentially a Free to play space ninja simulator, where you get to shoot space marines and robots to death or slice them up with a sword or shurikens (I know, it's already becoming the coolest game you have ever heard of). It's got a whole bunch of different playstyles in the form of different 'Warframes', which are basically just armor suits that have different abilities (that also apparently can change your gender... MAGIC), all of the different Warframes have unique abilites and strengths that set them apart from one another. Some have increased armor and health to make them more viable and powerful in melee combat, and others have increased proficiency with ranged weapons like bows and guns. You can customize each and every one of them with cosmetic items that are bought using the games premium currency - platinum. Cosmetic items obviously do not give any bonus and there is no 'pay to win' factor regarding them, in fact, there is no pay to win factor in the game whatsoever seeing as it is a mainly co-op game, and also due to the fact that pretty much every premium item in the game (including items that increase the power of weapons and Warframes) is obtainable by in-game means, such as special events (like traders that show up every once in a while selling special cosmetic items for ingame credits or a different currency known as 'Ducats' that are normally bought using platinum.)  So pretty much, there is no 'pay to win' factor in this game unless you consider getting a different coloured dog 'pay to win'...  It's kind of grindy at times but if you're like me and don't really care about that then this game can be fun at all times.   Now the only gripe I have about this game is sort of scraping the bottom of the barrel... The platinum pricing is kind of ridiculous, you can buy 75 platinum for 5 Dollars... To buy one single Warframe, it costs anywhere from 75 platinum all the way to 325! That's alot of real money. But like I said, you can get all of the Warframes for ingame cash instead of paying real money, so it's not really a problem for Free to Play players, only for people who want to speed up their progress with Platinum currency.

            "review_text": "So now that I have an idea of how to play this game I can say I reccomend it but with caveats:  First its opaque, when you go into the equip screen the game looks pay 2 win or like a demo because pretty much everything costs premium currency. HOWEVER what the game doesn't tell you is that you can buy blueprints of everything on there and craft it yourself. HOWEVER HOWEVER that requires grinding ingame money and materials in order to make those weapons.  The intial offering of planets looks small but you need to unlock more by killing bosses and getting specific planet nav coordinates.  Now this is the most important thing I'm going to mention here, because its practically omni important: if you don't enjoy the moment to moment gameplay inside of missions you will not enjoy Warframe. If you aren't willing to spend real money to get things faster the game is grindy requiring you to grind for both money and materials to craft everything. However everything that effects gameplay(aka eveerything but cosmetics) is craftable without paying a cent. HOWEVER 2.0 it requires a lot of grinding to craft everything. So if you don't enjoy the basics of gameplay this game isn't for you.  The one thing I do like about the grinding is that there are a lot of smaller goals in upgrading your weapons and warframe to keep you going. Lots of percentage upgrades you can slot into and upgrade on your gear as you level it up.   So basically:  play through the tutorial and see if the gameplay appeals to you  be prepared to look up a guide on stuff if you don't have massive amounts of money to spend The game IS free to play, truly free to play the main way they get money out of you is through cosmetics and avoiding grinding Look into blueprints on the market, not just the equip screen, the equip screen makes the game look like a paid for demo(its not) Level ranges for missions do not refer to your mastery level, they refer only to the level of enemies you will be facing there nothing more Leveling your items on their own does not increase their stats at all, they increase the number of upgrades you can equip on them completing a mission unlocks adjacent missions, somewhere on newly unlocked planets are the nav coordinates for the next planet in the progression",

The new player expiriance is in need of some improvement. I still find the base game fun.   You can't actually use credits to buy weapon/warframe slots. You can't even craft the slots. The only way, as far as I know, to get those extra slots is to buy them with real money or go through the trading system to get the special in-game currency to buy the slots. There might be another way to get them, but the game doesn't explain these things well.  This games' text tutorials need to be replaced with something more hands-on. Seriously, text tutorials are not fun to sit through. It put me off when I started playing.  The rest of the game is slow, but fun. It's the kind of game you can jump in and jump out of once in a while without feeling like you are missing out on anything, or, if you are board, sit and play for hours. There is fun to be had. The amount of content and coustomization in this game is amazing. Modifying the apperance of anything you own in this game is possible. I've heard the very end of the game is sometimes refered to as 'Fashionframe'.  If I had money to spend on this game, I would just get some slots and maybe some extra color palets.   Extra note to devs: Please fix your bugs. I was fighting a boss and it became literally impossible near the end. Not hard, unbeatable.",

C) you went too much solo. This game is perfect to a t. However despite that once you are sucked in you will find you want to do other things despite this game being so blasted awesome! Thereof the game hits the sweet spot in your gray matter of the cortex in your brain and vanishes from the fun nerve. In a matter of coloqiualism you miss that fun spot by a hair and make people pay for certain tech upgrades. I understand why, but this also creates road blocks. I wish you would simply attack $20. onto the title and then create a lot of free addons. This game is amazing but not quite in another reguard as it's too perfect to be believable.

Bad:  -Overpriced real money to game value ratio of items(15 dollars for a color pack!!!!! yea its dumb) -Start with limited colors to decorate your warframe and weapons with no other way to get colors other than real money. -The crafting times on blueprints of weapons warframes and sentinel pets are REDICULOUS, weapons take 12-24 hours REAL TIME to complete and warframes take 3 days 12 hours(yeah its pretty insane, I can see why a lot of people give up playing soon.) -Very slow paced at the beginning due to the horrendous crafting system with very limited weapons/warframes. -Feels as if this game belongs on Facebook due to all the crafting wait time restrictions witch are pointless. -Repetive reworks of art in the levels and enemies and a few glitches here and there.  MY RATING: 7/10  IF they got rid of the horrendous wait time on the crafting system and lowered their prices a bit more people would have the patience to stick around the game, if you look past that it truly is a crown jewel of a game.",

The movement does not feel good to control. Most of your movement options take away control and force you on a fixed path, with just a hair of air control. Melee attacks go in the direction of the camera, rather than the direction your character is facing. You can climb up basically any surface by mashing the jump button repeatedly. There's very little degree of analog control. The control tutorial doesn't even require that you do most of the things it asks of you. I'm surprised this kind of stiff control gets a pass from action gamers.  I never felt like I was in any danger whatsoever, even when standing still, surrounded by enemies, under fire from multiple directions. Standing still and shooting at stuff was sufficient for every enemy encounter I saw.  On a gamepad where there seem to be a few missing button mappings (weapon switching, deflecting attacks with my sword, possibly others). Button prompts are displayed as keyboard keys, no matter if you're playing on a gamepad.  Overall, I'm not impressed. Given that other reviewers are complaining about grinding and overpriced transactions and that the game isn't even satisfying to control, I'm going to pass on this.",

Curious what the future holds for this one.  - Edit on 20150313: the dev crew seems to listen a lot to their players, which is amazing, but I did quit this game a while ago now. I've played it for probably more than a year, played a lot, and it's a nice game, with loads of potential. However, the pvp system is still horrible, and I'm sick of the pve grinding. Every time you think you are close to finally being done with grinding, more grinding appears. It's not like the usual grindfest rpgmmo's, it's way better than that, but still not something I want to do. Ever since the void trader it's impossible to get the things you need (unless you don't have to worry about spending time on a job, kids, or other things), so I see no reason to keep playing this game on a regular basis. It is a very nice shooter where the melee combat system is equally good, or in my opinion even better than the shooting system. Pretty good game, but not for me, at least not anymore. Have fun with it, but don't expect to reach max rank, or get every single weapon or mod in the game if you start playing this. I do miss the combat system in a lot of other games tho..",

For just a free to play game, this one is a lot of fun, and it has amazing graphics plus it runs really smooth. Some people say that you have to buy platinum if you want decent stuff. But actually, the only time you have to use platinum, is when you want cosmetics (i.e. Helmet, syandana, better colours, etc...), more warframe/weapon slots, or to purchase something right away. Now, I would recommend using the 50 platinum they give you to start off with, to buy more slots, because the cosmetic stuff isn't really that important, where as slots are.  Basically everything else, you can get blueprints for, then go around to the different planets and missions to gather the materials to build them. Some blueprints (warframes for example) require that you fight bosses more than once or go into the void so you can get things such as, the helmet, chassis, and systems. Yes, this can take some time, but it's worth it in the end.  Overall, I think this is a great game! The only negatives I could think of, is how some maps are used more than once, even though you're on a totally different planet, and the fact that you have to buy more colours with platinum. But, other than that, this game is great, and if you haven't already, try it out! It's free :D",

I'm not gonna lie, it's top quality and worth playing if not for that quest line. The gameplay is awesome.

The best part, in my opinion is the fact that you can honestly grind your way to the top. Even the plat you can get from selling off the grinding loot can be more than enough. The prime warframes are another fun part, not only do they look badass, but the race to get them before they're vaulted and never seen again for who knows how long is also a plus. All in all even with all the recent hate and nerfs and kinda repetitive quests I still love this game and can't get over it, atleast not anytime soon. P.S: The second Dream questline was MINDBLOWING...I would say it was game changing, although the focus part desperately needs a re-work with how long it take to even get a single level(average of a few hundred everytime i get the beacon) with 50-70k points.

Everything just makes you feel like a badass (even healing your allies) combat is fast, fluid and fun.  The grind is a big reason why many poeple play the game and I would like to think of it as a double edged sword...  Upon playing nearly 500 hours of the game I have come to realise the truth that DE are trying to hide. Maybe with their new updates they keep adding.  The game has no point playing it at all. Not one bit. All your time farming, leveling and just overall grinding (to be the very best.... kill me) has not actually point other to give you 'bragging rights' so to speak (even though people dont because a nice community but I think deep down everyone does some without thinking about it) Getting that 20+ MR rank will take you quite a long time and you really don't have anything to do once you got all the weapons and frames you personally want. Yes there are quests even though only really one of the quests actually has meaning to the lore of the game (The second dream) and the PvP is bad because the game was not originally made for PvP in mind...  Another thing I would say for people to be wary off is the buffing and nerfing that DE does to frames and weapons. They are way to heaving in nerfing and buffing things. Somethings will come up and just look insanse. People will then hop on the train and forma the 'god weapon' 5+ times and then DE just say '♥♥♥♥ you' and nerf it to trash tier. Some people like it but I for one do not like it and I wish they would just balance instead of just making some weapons and frames unplayable compared to other frames (Love you oberon)  Overall if you are one of those people that like the grinding for the sake of grinding and want to show of your sweet MR level to people then this game is pretty much perfect. However if you play this game to get something out of the grind then I am sorry to say that DE hasn't really got much instore for you. However I still HIGHLY suggest you just try the game out.  Another this is the community in this game is one of the best I have seen and if you need help don't be afraid to ask in region. There is always people their to help you.  Sorry this has been a quick review I wanted to keep it kind of short as I could talk about this game for days and if anyone has comments or their own oppinions on the game leave a comment as I will be very intrested to see other people opinions on the game.

So moving on, the game play has alot of innovative idea's poorly implemented. So lets start with the big elephant in the room, the free to play set up of the game is a pharce. Without spending real money on platinum or items you are at a huge disadvantage. Gear , experience and money come slow grinding, not a little slow but insanely slow. Two weeks of playtime my gear is all around level 10 and everyone keeps telling me it gets better. So why suffer through crappy game play to get to end game content that once again favors people who are willing to dump real money in the game? Ahh spend money yourself you say, well here's my counter. When you swing weapons they follow a static path much like an old style mortal kombat game. Meaning things like hills or rocks or a slight incline will cause your melee weapon to whiff. Secondly try wall running or duck jumping, again confounded by terrair rocks poor control and slight inclines. And finally the deal breaker , mission types. Certain missions like say the spy missions , wretched at best. Where one twitchy mob or missclick causes mission failure. Now throw into that ability missfires and buggy mobs are just part of the game. I'm not talking about stuff that you can compensate with skill over, I'm talking about the game randomly screwing you because of crappy code. Hmm I shot the dude on the alarm yet he triggered it after he died, well balls. Or my favorite running an extermination mission and the wildlife attacks him and knocks him into terrain making it impossible for me to complete the mission. And my final beef with the game is its revive system, limited revives that you have to spend real money on to refresh or you fail on missions because you're out of revives when your randomly screwed over with a bug, Deal breaker. This game should not be played by anyone unless this sort of half arsed game design is your niche.",

The Exterior of Planets is Amazing, rain, snow or sun.   Characters and building: there are many Characters or Warframes, usualy you will have to scavange blueprints and parts for it through bosses of some planets but it doesn't take long time to 'farm' but the longest is the building it self: Parts for Warframes: 12 hours, Warframe it self: 3 entire days.   There are 5 Factions: |Grineer|- Enemies from Earth. |Corpus|- technologically advanced humans that have a variety of troops and drones. |Orokin|: Corrupted by power and eternal live theese Soldiers Live Longer than every other faction, unless you came and kill them all, |Infested|: All Kinds of Other Factions and some exclusive Infested Enemies, these are things are infected with some sort of biological weapon or virus. |Tenno|: Ancient warriors that fight for freedom and truth and you playing as one of their Soldiers, Tenno are the only ones that can controle the Warframes and their power.  Nice things!: +Graphics!  + Character and Weapons variety  + Mods that can change entire game  + Updates that always add a Warframe and Guns  + Alerts or Time Limited mission plus Challanges  + Stalker and Other Assasins that can suprise you and drop something good if killed   Not so nice things about this game:  - Long Building times that can only be skipped by paying 5$  - Hard Levling up on profile level that rewards you with acces to weapons.  - Sometimes awfull long loading and Ping Problems.   Unselected:  +/ - Platinum isn't soo needed but you can buy Completed weapons and Warframes for it also some Prime Gear.

MEh....  fun and fast paced but repetitive and boring after a few games.  since then, the Dev's have been hard working, every single update they did closed their flaws, optimised and unplayable game,  braught it to an extreme content Filled World, remade the UI braught thousands of bonus to player, and even after the game was branded ''Pay to Win'' after a few updates it felt as if it was already a thing of the past.  if you feel like playing a game that is.  - Fast Paced. - Encourage either full out assault AND Stealth. - single and Multiplayer experience. - Challenging gameplay (hard to master) - hundreds of weapon. - Full crafting system. - Unlimited Replay - Dozens of character to play with and Unlock - a good community  and the best of all, Dev's that freakin listen to player :P this game will be for you, and for those who say the game is missing stuff or not to your liking, tell the dev's and stay patient, i've never seen anything not getting fixed  since the start of this game !!

Honeslty the quest chain of 'Natah' 'Stolen Dreams' and 'Second Dream' are huge for people who get lore boners. pay attention and obsorb this games history and lore, and then play those three quests.... No regrets! #4: Cool Concept and great gameplay! I mean common, space katanas and laser cannons in the same game.  Cons: #1: RNG will rule your life! #2: There is a bit of a learning curve, and honeslt they are working on the new player experiance. #3: Archwing (A certain ingame mission type) Is flat out broken, and honestly has no real purpose to make it something people WANT to play. Not that I want to be forced to play this broken Mode! #4: There is no cure for Warframe fevor, Once you got it... it's pretty much like hurpies you can get it to go away for awhile bit it will keep popping up!  While Hours played does not mean everything I think my time speaks for itself as to how much I am addicted, and how much I know mechanics wise about the game. but I emplore you to play it and decide for yourself, it's free and you can always stop playing...

I come back from time to time to check for updates and new content.   to put things in a nutshell,you are a space ninja. (a warframe) and you have to kill the bad guys, basically. you can do crazy tricks like walljumping and bullet jumping. each warframe comes with their own unique abilities, looks and aesthatics. want to be a swamp monster?no problem. want to be a mummy? no problem. want to be a pink colored sassy pseudo body builder?no problem. i love a LOT of things in this game. but that doesn't mean the game comes without it's flaws. so here's a couple of pros and cons;  -Pro's- -A lot of class diversity -A huge variation of weapons  -A lot of customization on both frames and weapons -The game offers interesting co-op gameplay -The devs listen to their players -Both great artistic and unique tilesets and npc's -Companions :D (cats dogs and small flying robots) -Devs do weekly platinum givaways (ingame currency) -Red text &lt;3 -One of the lesser toxic communites out there -F2P! -#Fashionframe -Weekly (mostly interesting) devstreams  -Cons- -Very Few and kind of repetetive mission types -The community doesn't tend to take criticism too lightly -Not a whole lot of content to go through -There's no real endgame (especially after spectres of the rails launched) -A LOT of RNG based farming (it's basically the main drive for the game) -Unbalanced pvp -It can take up to 3 days to craft new items -The game wont pose a challenge at all after after you get some of the less basic stuff -Leechers -A lot of bugs... -Clunky interfaces -Today's strongest weapon is tomorrow's mastery fodder  Know that the game is still in beta and receives monthly updates. The devs put a lot of work and effort in the game.  So obviously some of the pro's and con's might shift a little over time. I dont think there's a whole lot more to say.  All in all, not a bad game.

The AI was actually smart, and ran away to get off a good shot when I rushed up with my amazing Excalibur warframe with a huge sword out. This game also impressed me with how not pay-to-win it was. I expected every weapon to be locked behind a paywall, (because it's a free game.) but the game impressed me by adding blueprints available to purchase with earnable in-game money. The characters are very cool, and I found infinite pleasure in watching a surprised enemy slowly stumble back after I chopped the top half of his body off, watching in gruesome detail, thanks to the incredible graphics, that would put most $60 games to shame. Now, moving on to the bad things. The other characters were in fact locked behing the disgusting, overpriced paywall, angering me incredibly. I'm about 9 hours into this game, and I have still noticed little to no variety about the enemy characters. Every few missions, you find one new enemy character, but that usually only shows up for one or two missions, isn't exciting, and they are few and far between.  In conclusion, I shall quickly recap on what I think about Warframe. Graphics: 9/10. Variety:6/10. Sound: 7.5/10. Characters: 8/10. AI: 8.5/10. Overall rating: 8.3916.

Never the less, this game is fun to play with friends or online, just make sure you have a decent internet connection. Since it is still beta, there a few glitches(like flinging yourself across the map) but they are more 'WTF was that!' and don't destroy the gameplay. Most of the weapons you want are also craftable for mostly resonable resources and in game cost. So P2W slightly balances out for weapons. The different Warframes and difficult to get, so either be prepaired to fork over some cash to get the one you want or grind for the resources you need to make it. The Warframe you start out with is prefectly viable and works, so they arent forcing you to P2W.  Online is decent, people a generally very nice though not often helpful (whether though lack of knowledge or lack of input). Except lag issues though, especially with lots of other people.  I only recommend this because it is free, and you dont have to pay to have decent items to play with.",

Having only 3 factions to fight in the same boring corridors got old very quick. In addition, the way the mod system is designed mean that weapon and warframe upgrading essentially becomes dependent on the games Random Number Generator meaning that just playing for a long time does not guarantee any sort of improvement in a players stats. It eventualy felt like a grind to just find the right mods and it causes players to rush through levels just to reach the end instead of having fun fighting. The game is also very pushy about microtransactions by making some items completely unobtainable unless you purchase them with ingame money (platinum) and by making the creating of some items (namely, warframes) very tedious to do on your own by requiring you to posess the blueprints for 3 different parts, craft them each, then craft the final warframe with yet another bluerpint. By comparison, you can purchase the completed frame along with a pre-installed catalyst (an item that improves the mod capacity of a warframe) for a few bucks.  I feel like I've had my fill of this game for now. Perhaps I will come back later if some serious changes are made to the progression system.",

There's no major currency (platinum) incentive except for 'give us your ♥♥♥♥ing money!'. The only ways to get it for free are to enter competitions or watch the dev streams and hope you win during that.   The gunplay is ok, but there's not much feel to the ranged weapons.  The melee combat, on the other hand is great! The game's truly redeeming feature.  It, however, is still not enough to save it from the barrel of F2P cashgrabs that are out there.",

The pve is ok but it seems like it gets a little TOO easy after a time. with the right build and game type you coul literally endlessly destroy your enemies. I use a simple valkyr with high ranked armor and a blade that drains hp for every hit. with that alone i cannot be killed instantly and i can heal back everything it does to me. so in a defense match I could literally just sit on the defend zone and cut up anything that comes. especially if its an infestation map with only melee units. atleast with ranged units you still need to dodge/ deflect. and run around in order to cach your enemies. but its pretty much the same thing for me.  the other pve game modes make it a bit tougher to tank and all since you have to move around quickly, though a maxed rush mod fixes valkyrs weakness there. and when in doubt just using ripline can get you around faster then almost anything else. so i guess valkyr would be the cheapest warframe there is. especialy with the hp drainin attack. with the right mods you could probably make the other frames just as cheap though. so its just a matter of your visual tastes on your character i guess. anyway i probably won;t be playing this game again. unless they make a way to CHOOSE wether to have an unranked PvP or not. atleast that way then if people wanna go with all unranked items its their perogative. don't force unranked and unmodded items on everyone.",

Albeit the cool customization options and the eye-candy graphics, Warframe feels like a half-♥♥♥♥♥ revamped version of Dark Sector( Which BTW, is one great game).  Also, do not expect any sort of plotline or story, all is built upon the F2P paradigm.

So you'll need to join up with other random players by requesting it through the Global Chat, or get your friends to download the game.  Most awesome characters/items can be bought. You can also farm the hell out of levels to get them; but trust me, it's not easy to do.  Overall a good game. I especially enjoyed the PvP missions which had immense amounts of players attacking each other.  Good game. If only I had a team.",

            "review_text": "Warframe is one of those games that's a diamond in the rough. It's a really great game only if you're willing to invest some serious time into it. It's easy to play this game for 30 minutes or an hour and say, 'I don't know what I'm doing.' or 'This game is bland and generic.' You really have to sit down with this game and give it some time before you find your own unique niche and fighting style. With each warframe you play with you realize you have to adjust and adapt your tactics to the strategic situation. Each frame has it's own unique powers so it's good to know how to utilize them for the right situation at the right time.   The more difficult battles in the game must be calculated carefully. Attributing factors about how to fight can be simply broken down like this: speed vs power, power vs technique, technique vs speed, power vs crowd control and crowd control vs stealth. Those where just some examples of factors to take into consideration when finding your fighting style but there are many more. Now with the right modifications for weapons and warframes you can begin to merge the abilities together into a super effective fighting style but again that takes time.   The fact that the game has multiplayer co-op in it as well really helps with the later levels of this game. Trying to go solo in this game works but for so long before you're going to need reinforcements. With the right team and proper weapons you can seem almost unstoppable at times. But that's also the beauty of the design of this game. It always makes you feel like you can always get stronger without making you feel like you're invincible and you have to stop trying. There's always something or someone out there that's just little bit stronger than you that's what keeps you going in your pursuit to improve yourself.   As I said before the game is a diamond in the rough and there are some obnoxious sections or situations the game might put you through. For example the drop rate for certain rare materials is ultra low meaning you'll be grinding on a level until you get the materials you need making so some stages very redundant. Or you'll find out you need to clear a specific level with a squad yet nobody breathes on that particular level you're trying to get through which makes waiting painful at times. If you don't feel like waiting for a squad to show up, they give you the option to start the mission by yourself anytime. But be forewarned you better be super prepared if you're going solo.   Minors flaws and nuisances aside, all and all it's a great game and a good time that's definitely worth a try. Even better when you bring your friends along for the journey. As with all reviews give it a try and play the game yourself at least once before you take someone else's review as gospel or fact and you decide for yourself whether or not the reviewer made a fair point or not.",

I love the graphics, it's nicely optimized, and although it's pretty hard for new players to navigate, I love this game. I would play it more, if it didn't have some problems. They just ruin everything.  I had a party bug that made me go solo always, which was no problem, but running a melee only interception is ridiculously difficult. I even asked their support team, and they just told me to open the two ports windows firewall automatically blocks- the ones that aren't monitored by firewalls. So, literally, they are asking me to be hacked. The guy who was helping me was like 'Even if you had money that I could steal, it's too much of a bother to steal from you. Who would steal from you?' Next thing they have is a $140 prime access sale.   Guess who has my credit card information now?  Why? Why would you use those ports? I was told by a GOVERNMENT employee- who works in web security- not to open those ports.  C'mon guys.   Not to mention everything is so bloody expensive. DE hands out plat discounts like crazy, (thanks guys) but $50 for Prime Access? I don't even want the weapons. Just give me the frame. Jeez. I could easily farm out the parts if your damned PARTY SYSTEM WORKED.   Even with the money leeched out of players for plat, we still have peer to peer hosting. The worst way to do it. Console has your servers. Why can't PC? Lag is fine. But not being able to connect to anyone is not. The game won't even register me as online. Couldn't ask for a more single-player multiplayer game.   Literally, all I want to do is play with other people. Is that not the point of a multiplayer game? I've tried port forwarding, opening ports through my router, completely disabling my firewall, changing game ports, etc, etc. Nothing works. But you go to any other game in my library- guess what? Multiplayer. Flawlessly. Even peer to peer. Fix your ♥♥♥♥, DE.",

PLAY IT. To start the quest chain:  use a scanner on a 'sentient'; a blue glowing, floating thing that makes a very distinctive noise. You can tell if they spawn by the flashing blue lights/ screen flickering. This will start you on the quest 'Natah' which is the prerequisite quest for The Second Dream.  ) + unique weapons and 'classes' (each Warframe and weapon excluding primes which are stronger versions of the base versions. You can get these with some effort as well.) + you can get everything functional in the game with some effort. + some cosmetic items (helmets and some weapon skins) are available during 'alert missions' + Music is glorious. + incredible cutscenes + Magnificent story-writing, and world-building + The three above create some of the most incredible things I have experienced in electronic media. Seriously. Cutting Onions. + Developers listen to the community and put user-made content into the game. And credit them. + more awesome content is constantly being added. + With very few exceptions: you can customize/recolour everything.  Tips = Hold sprint-hold crouch-melee is how you spin-attack with a melee weapon (it increases damage) = Hold Crouch-jump to bullet jump. You can aim where you want to go. You can even do this in the air after your first jump. Also, you can double jump. = Aiming while in the air makes you glide. = Scanners can be purchased from the store using credits (normal in-game currency) and are used to fill out the in-game cyclopedia. = Be mindful of your environment, there are explosive barrels (the video-game staple) and fragile glass (not normally a problem, but in a spaceship...well...don't worry though, you cant get sucked out, you just need to hack a console). = There are glass floors.Not in spaceships, though, and you can't break them. So feel free to walk all over that glass. = Orokin Catalysts and Reactors you can get every now and then through special alert missions. = Resources only drop from specific locations.  = However, some resources, such as Tellurium, drop from certain mission types ie. Tellurium drops from Archwing missions (missions where you equip an 'archwing' which are personal spacecraft and fly around in space. You get the first one from a questline) = after clearing all missions on a planet, you can use extractors to get resources from that planet while you play other missions. = The platinum (premium currency) you start with is 'free platinum' and cannot be traded with other players and will be used first before using platinum that you purchased. = save your starting platinum for getting more slots for warframes or weapons (slots for   more  warframes or weapons) = highlighting missions on the system map will tell you what type of mission it is = top left of the system map, you can choose to set the 'room type' to 'public' where anyone can join/ you join a random group, 'friends only' and 'solo', which are self-explanatory. = recommended to try public on harder missions or missions where you are unsure of what to do; other players will often help out greatly = coordinate with your team - Strategy is your greatest weapon. = there are locations which you can trade and interact with other players on certain planets (locations depend on your platform: pc, PS, or Xbox) = When you want to know about drop lists, stats, and such; Google is your friend = Patience is key = all weapons and warframes you acquire will need to be built (with a some exceptions). They will also need time to be built, weapons take 12hrs, whereas warframes take (depending on how long it takes to get the parts and resources) between 4 days to a week to build. (so far only one frame takes a week, every other warframe takes 4 days. This time assumes you have all the necessary parts and resources) = when you obtain a certain amount of level with your equipment your exp bar under your icon in the esc menu will glow, letting you know that you are ready to take the test to ascend in rank (Mastery Rank. Some weapons are 'Mastery locked', requiring a minimum rank to build). These tests range from parkour to stealth to combat, some with time limits, some without. = don't fret if you feel progress is slow, you'll get there eventually  Warning, side effects using awesome abilities may include: sudden euphoria, inability to say anything except scream'THIS IS AWESOME', unstoppable fits of giggling, feelings of being overpowered and scary (against the AI), and Terrible, Terrible Damage (against your enemies). Or just plain old have fun.  Have fun and a nice day!  P.S. seriously, go watch some of those prime warframe introduction trailers such as Nekros Prime and Saryn Prime. Insanely well written, powerful lines.   Also, RNG hates me...but this a more personal thing so this rant goes here...  ",

The developers are constantly adding new content, which can actually be a little bit overwhelming at times, but there's always new stuff to do. The developers are involved with the community, and are generally fast with the bug fixes. Did I mention the bugs? There's new bugs with every update, but most of it is minor stuff that gets fixed quickly.  Platinum: You can spend large amounts of real world money on the premium currency and end up with very little to show for it. However, if you are smart about how you spend platinum, you can avoid some of the early-game 'grinding' and get some fun cosmetic items as well. Warframe is certainly not a 'pay-to-win' game, but at some point you're really going to need some Plat. If you don't want to spend real money, you can get all of the Plat you'll ever need through in-game trades. I have most of the cosmetic stuff, 90% of the weapons, and all of the warframes, but I only purchased $25 of Plat when I first started playing.",

Now I think I've learned all the moves that my character can do but I probably haven't. Btw, the movement controls is my favorite aspect of the game. It's real easy to learn, but impossible to master.   Warframe never ceases to surprise me. You think you've got it figured out and then you realize something new you've never done before.

It's a trade off but one I gladly made a lot. I'm happy to have put some money in this game given how much entertainment I've gotten out of it.

No. Game has taken too much of those trip mines that I can see the death point of the game quite clearly on my part. If you want to play it go ahead but I just say this. Do not spend money in it. Until Devs can repair the game. Then you can go nuts but do not spend your money in this until they have learned their lesson and actually does something correctly.  Difference in Scale abuse? Checked. RNG abuse more than anything you have ever seen? Checked. Difficulty? Doesn't pretty much even exist. What can we learn about the game? How you should never construct a game.  If you are not believing me what I say about it. Just look at my profile and think a moment how much I have had been through in the game. Over 2000 hours I can tell you that there is a lot of ways to fix this game but DE just turns their head away.  Do play it but don't spend on it. They don't deserve it.

This is literally and without exaggeration the most boring and monotonous game I have ever played in my life.  Here how you play. Walk through a corridor to find the button to open the door to the next corridor to get to the end of the level. Sometimes there will be two buttons and you will require the presence of another player. A random online player will appear in your game out of nowhere to achieve this and then you can go about ignoring each other. Enemies without AI will shoot at you from the side lines while you ignore them and continue on finding more buttons to open more corridors.  - Environments are bland and unchanging. I'm not sure what my environment was supposed to be, but it looked like an abandoned warehouse labyrinth. The main features are long corridors between store rooms with a terminal operated door on each end, repeated ad nauseam. In space. I have not seen level design this bad before.  - Enemies are indistinct drones who do nothing interesting but stand on the spot and wait for death whilst very slowly shooting peas at you. I had to deliberately stand still in packs of them to find what it would take to kill me.  - The sword doesn't actually cut, it seems to just do damage points. You have to press E to 'cut the enemy in half' about 5 times to do enough damage points to kill them, while they shoot you at point blank, doing of course, no damage.  - I don't know what my character was supposed to be doing or why, other than opening doors to more doors. I hope I never find out because I'm sure it will make the game even worse.  I'm afraid I've actually made the game sound far better than it is, so whatever good impression you get from that, divide it by 50.  If you have played games before there will be nothing new here for you. If you are a mindless drone you might be able to use this game to fill the time between now and your death as blandly as possible.  Score: 2/100",

Farming void relics is incredibly tedious, basically turning every other game mode into void relic camp. Only one reward / void relic, too, unlike the multiple rewards you could get from defense/survival void missions earlier. And party is basically mandatory to have the slightest chance of the rarer rewards.  I could deal with the stupid energy system. The lack of any balance whatsoever (hello Tonkor!) was still ok, the game's fun regardless. Basically mandatory p2w to get orokin reactors/catalysts to make frames/weapons usable, fine, I'm supporting a good game. But this? This makes the game itself incredibly tedious, dull and annoying. And the farming no longer feels even slightly rewarding. The devs have been attempting to make farming awful for a long while, and finally managed to land the deathblow.",

I'm not in the mindset to pay real money for virtual items especially in a multiplayer game whose player base will eventually move on, making my purchases moot. Unlike with an MMO that has an upkeep cost, this game has no such things to worry about as far as I know.   Pros: -Runs on lower end systems pretty easily -Fun in short bursts  Cons: -Grindy as hell, takes forever to earn anything outside of buying it with real money -Odd glitches and bugs still pop up constantly from being unable to revive teamates to your HUD locking in place  Only get if you have a massive amount of time to spare or massive amounts of money you want to throw away.

Nobody in this game ever gave me a hand when I needed it.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this game. It's free to play, but there is no such thing as refunds for wasted time.",

Sure you can purchase everything with the in game cash but unless you have until the 31st century you'll be stuck with the starter gear, getting new warframes (the characters/suits you use) you need to kill a boss over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over trying to get 3 special blueprints from it, then spend cash to craft them, then buy the main blueprint and spend 3 DAYS crafting it, and then it's mostly worthless unless you use real money to upgrade it to hold more mods that make it useful. Now of course with some buddies it's not that bad because the grind is faster, but if one of your friends is rich then YOU HAVE BEEN SENT A SIGN FROM THE WARFRAME GODS. But either way it's a fun enough game, hack and slash your way through several nice looking locals, fighting several different groups of enemies that require different tactics, and it's still in beta belive it or not. Overall i give this one a U out of 5. And remember kids, dosh dosh dosh.",

            "review_text": "This game can be fun at the beginning. But after a hour or two. It gets really boring doing either older or newer levels because it's just either shooting bullets into enemies and while there isn't even skills to solo a match. The people in the trade chat is annoying due to people were looking to buy the things I wanted to sell but they're like, 'screw you, I wanna be racist and get my things that you have but from another guy' This game makes me sick sometimes. I have no clue what going on sometimes from either so many dam blind spots in the game that makes you just wanna raise your hands and say, 'I'm gonna grab something to eat and think about what the heck is happening here???'. The jumping is wonky and the game expects you to not have fun with the game. From the hours I have played on this game with my cousin and a few players. I wasn't having fun getting parts and building primary, secondary, and thirdary weapons for either a day, 3 days, or 7 days. I gone through all the planets and the voids and plus the stupid events that kepts on crashing my game (which made me stop playing the game for a long time). I even joined a clan, the quality for the logo sucks and the duel was small as hell and the obstacle course was probably the only thing is good unless the characters were only working correctly instead of my guy grabs a edge and walk off the edge either on accident or probably doing it on purpose from the game lacks on platforming anyways. The people in the game were definitely not polite at all. Anyone that makes a comment on other games saying they don't like it just because there's not enough content can just simply not say anything like that unless you play the game over 100 hours. There's a few negative things that I don't like the game which is very important and what is important is the reputation this game really has. I tried to talk to tons of people and figure out that 80% of the players I have talked to which at least 70 players doesn't like players who plays warframe to have fun on and the other percent which is 20% which has 30 players who likes players who plays warframe to have fun on. That isn't a reason to hate the game but the players in the game to hate on due to players probably played the game too much and gets angry from people having fun on the game even though they have don't know what they're doing sometimes because of them either 1. checking on their text messages on their phone or 2. They have lifes. The other negative feedback I'm gonna let out on this game is the lack of voices in your pod(yes I called it a pod simple). I wanted to play the game with no female or male voice telling me what I already know what's going on from 20 seconds before. settings does have the other voice actor that talks to you through your pod but no other than that you'll literally be stuck on listening to the voices inside your head when you go to bed and sometimes saying shut up without realizing it. That is all the negative feedback I'm gonna give on this game but the positive feedback on this game is that, it's very graphical and it has very good weapons, warframes, swords, a obstacle course, hub-station, and neat terrain. Other than that, that was my review thanks for reading my review and have a good day on playing some other game with your friends or family.  -Cashdar",

            "review_text": "The biggest thing I regret while writing this review is that I genuinely want to like this game, I really do! I originally heard about it from this MMO site's 'Free to Play MMO showdown', in which Warframe and my beloved MMO of choice Mabinogi were the final contestants. This game won by a small handful of votes and I honestly cannot for the life of me see why with some of the glaring flaws it has.  Let's talk about new players. You literally need them and need them to stay to make your MMO thrive. So why is Warframe so damn HOSTILE towards them? First, you only get to choose from three of the 30+ warframes. On top of that, they're incredibly weak warframes. Now I understand that part. You're a newbie, you're not supposed to start out ripped as hell. But there's basically no diversity in the choice. 'Oh, there's no role you're comfortable with amongst these three playstyles? Too bad! Grind to hell and back, give us your money, or go screw yourself!'. And on top of that, the game explains nothing but the very raw basics at the beginning. Had I not had several friends who were already experienced with this game, I would have quit sooner. And don't even bother asking strangers for help, you'll either be completely blown off or completely made fun of!  And speaking of friends, don't bother trying to play with them! You'll disconnect at least five times under the guise of 'transferring hosts' before you decide that putting up with the constant disconnection either isn't worth it or until your friends just finish the mission without you.  Oh, and apparently there are 'wrong' weapon choices, too. If you don't pick the best weapons the tutorial can provide, you're basically screwed for the first several HOURS of the game. Especially when you want to rank up. And even when you CAN get a new weapon? You have to put up with arbitrary grinding and the game's ungodly crafting system. Seriously, an entire damn day for one new gun? THREE days for a new warframe? Not even counting all the hours you have to grind for the necessary materiels and having to craft each individual parts of said warframe first? I haven't seen a crafting system with such BS arbitrary wait times since Phantasy Star Online 2. And even then it has redeeming qualities to make up for it!  The entire line of progression is basically 'grind and sit on your butt while waiting, give us your money, or ♥♥♥♥ off'. This game shows so much potential! But according to older players the developers of this game have squandered it not once, but TWICE.",

To do this I had to go to Venus, find sites where blueprints are buried and then defend an excavation unit as it unearths one. There are four different blueprints needed to build an Archwing. As you do this enemies spawn constantly and it seems to me that the level gets progressively more difficult the longer you are there. The annoying part comes when you realise that whatever blueprint you get is random, I've played this level repeatedly and keep getting the same two blueprints. Also you need to kill certain enemies to get energy that's needed to power the excavators and the game has refused to spawn these enemies for me, leaving me with no option but to exit the level immensely frustrated. I can understand random loot drops but not for quest items, this mechanic seems to be a negative consequence of the game being free to play and it's a pity because there is something truly special here otherwise. Anyone that enjoys third person shooters/ melee and doesn't mind tedious grinding or paying to skip it will have a better experience.",

            "review_text": "Games vary on what you are into. Some people mindlessly shoot people like in COD or Battlefield. Others enjoy platforming like the Homie Crash, Ratchet and Clank and Jak and Daxter. Some enjoying grinding for what they want so they can earn it. Others simply want rewards whenever they feel like or want it as soon as they find out about it. This game is a combination of most of these things. I personally consider this as a 3rd person Platformer shooter with Grind fest^34th. Its more than just ninjas in space. Your tools truly do shape you. You go in there with a halfmodded class, youre gonna have to work your ♥♥♥ off in order to not die and keep up with your friends. Go in there with actual modding setup, you'll be able to hold your own and even half play while you text your girl about spring break plans (Sorry, didnt mean to sound objective) Unless you put in the time to properly prepare and some research to crunch numbers on what build is most effective agasint what with what team composition. The gameplay itself is fun, sure some frames can use similar abilities or nowhere near similar abilities to reach the same result, ♥♥♥♥ dying or getting from point a to ledge b for example. There are dozens of weapons and while theres a significant bit that are garbage or have unrealistic standards for making the weapon, theres still a crapton of weapons that are effective and plainly just FUN. I've been playing this since Update 9 during Ember prime access on console all the way to Update 13 or 14, took a break, came over to pc RIGHT before the chroma update. So I'm not some dude who came through during the tailend of stuff, I've been around for AWHILE so I can honestly take appreciation for all the changes and advances in the mechanics, bullet jump is awesome. Outside of Gameplay, the story you have to string together yourself. READ EVERYTHING. The codex entries, the dialogue the bosses havem, pay attention during the quests and whatever else Lotus (Space Mom) says to you. From a writers standpoint, the story was ok and has vass amount of potential until Update 18.0. The big Reveal in the quest 'The Second Dream' For Update 18.0 was lame, made many plot holes, and disappoints many. Alot of people don't have the patience to piece together the story and so many don't see the problem with the plot twist but imagine that you put in the time and effort and the research to actually know whats going on and why every alien species/factions are afraid of you and hate you. Imagine putting forth the initiative only for the biggest sack of disappointment to where you literally say 'Ooook this is getting stupid'. Imagine getting that middle finger to the face about the claim of everything being canon even though the lore is stabbed in multiple parts and has stab wounds known as plot holes. Imagine the fact the director of this warframe project , Steve Sinclair, replies to criticism about this plot hole like a snobby 5 year old. He doesnt take criticism well so when he is told that his creation wasnt thought out very well and doesnt make sense, he's gonna be a prick about it. He doesnt go as far as to ban you or block you but he will make you reconsider coming to him for help. As a whole, we've witnessed Steve Sinclair And Rebecca Ford go at it because as the community manager Rebecca gets paid to know how we are and our thoughts towards things that need to be changed or improved upon. Steve can't accept that the things he does arent 100% full proof so its an uphill battle for Ford. Sorry for the ranting, just wanted to make this as honest as possible. Gameplay is good, Grinding is insanely high and sometimes broken, Story was good until the garbage 'Plot twist' known as the 2nd dream. If you don't care about story and can deal with not getting that thing you want anywhere from 8 hours to 2 months later, by all means, play this game my friends.",

So completely unreasonable bans are possible.

Upon playing through the update for the second dream, I realized that even though so much of this game is extremely well done, there are quite a few mind breaking ideas that just defy the continuity of their own universe.   I will not go into spoilers, however it will suffice to say that whoever wrote the ending to the quest did not understand human ideals as a species.  If you're looking for a good way to pass time, then this is a game for you.  However, if you're looking for an interesting storyline, beleivable motives, and a good naritive, then this is not a game you should be playing.",

Character Customization is expansive, with a varity of cosmetics to choose from, inluding animation style for your Character. Howevery, I do find it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ty that the game makes you buy colors.   Combat depends on the people playing, but you're more likelyto encounter Grinders are more likely to rush to the objective and complete the mission. There are a varity of Weapons to mow down enemies with as well as mods to make them even more powerful.   Story is not that bad if you pay attention to it. There are some intresting concepts that caught my eye.   There is stealth in this game, but it's really crappy so if you're gonna try, do it solo or with friends.   As I said, this game is boring without friends to play it with. Now why not use pubilc? Because it's kinda crappy. You have to set up a game first, go into the public chat and start recuiting and then start. Jumping into the middle of a mission is doesn't always workout to well and there's also the fact that there are some connecting and syncing issues that still need to be worked out.   Overall I give this game a 7/10 (Great Game). Warframe still has some flaws to work out but it's still a good game. Just, get yourself some friends to play with before you start.

You can get pretty much anything worthwhile in game without spending a penny, so there is always the truly cheap option here. That aside, the gameplay is fun when it works. Join in with other robot-alien ninja in random multiplayer co-op and blast through missions. Use super powers, unlock more powers and upgrades, get levels, get more upgrades, get new stuff, etc. It all works pretty well for this fast-paced shoot n' slash adventure. Environments are fun and interesting for a good while, and while there is a bit of grind at least you'll have a fun time doing it. After playing through the same missions a few times I just never got wore out of anything.  Combat is flexible and varied, there is a unique class system with powers being tied to your armor, an impressive arsenal of weapons can be tweaked with mods as you go to fit your tastes, bosses are interesting and challenging, and it's got a nice setting set in a future solar system space world. And, again, it doesn't cost anything to player.  Bad: Easily summarized. Grinding. There is a LOT of grinding here. You've got to get materials and credits to make things for free (more a problem for the former), and once you do there is a 12 hour timer to antagonize your attempts to get free weapons. Materials you need for new stuff aren't readily available, so if you want anything other than the starting rifle early on you'll have to buy. Things seem expensive for an ftp though (or maybe I don't know jack about ftp economies). Also, there is a limit on how much stuff you can actually carry, so there is that expected required buy-in if you want more inventory space for new guns and the like; otherwise you have to sacrifice your old stuff. At least that's not very expensive. As far as actual gameplay, there are only a few types of enemies, and the environments are a little repetitive despite how well made they are. For all the tools and toys you get, there aren't a whole lot of places and things to use them on.  Just lots of the same places, and lots of time you need to spend to get anything. Grind grind grind. Loot loot loot. Do it all again. That's all there is to it.  Overall: It's definitely grind-heavy and repetitive, and if either of those things annoy you then don't expect to like this one.  But none of that gets in the way of some cool gameplay and general good multiplayer fun. If you are looking for a quick action game that you can easily jump into and play without putting a hole in the wallet, then there is a lot to like here. At the very least, it IS free, so what is there to lose? Give it a try. I recommend it.",

This Warframe LOOKS beautiful and the gameplay is fluent, the parkour element can be irritating yet it still works when you use it correctly.   However, most say this game is P2W -- I respectfully disagree, as some items you can pay for, you can simply craft the items when you have a blueprint, I found a Banshee Chassis and Paris bow blueprints, which is pretty good.   The Tenno you can play as add a whole new, not very complex but again, extremely fluent gameplay.  You can go to the very well balanced Excalibur, the first. Electrocute your enemies with Volt, fry them -- LITERALLY! You can also crush your enemies with Mag, again -- quite literally. Ram through a barrage of Grineer with Rhino! Turn invisible and move behind your enemies with an advantage, create a energy created duplicate of yourself to distract enemies to get an advantage as Loki!   These are five Tenno from many more, it's extremely lovely to have so many options but that can irritate you also, you always must think about what Tenno is good for what! Excalibur is a mostly all-round Tenno, Rhino -- I would say is pretty offense to me, there are so many options it's amazing.

Rinse repeat, rinse repeat. If you've played CABAL (another free MMO) this is the ninja robot CABAL for more powerful computers. You grind repeatable missions, for mats to build gear, to grind harder repeatable missions, to do the same. if you're looking for an RPG, go somewhere else, this is a F2P grind fest  Just another F2P with limited functionaltiy and unforgiving (thoughtless entry) once you as a new player make a class decision. You can not undo it, make a new guy etc... YOu're stuck with the decisions you make during the tutorial (apparently some weapon choices are MUCH MUCH better then others. Lets say you chose excalibur and went with the Bo Staffm well two things, you have to wait ages to get the sword you could have had (while the Bo staff is easily buyable with in game currency, the sword is not. Instant regret decisions you can't redo with a new toon. Lets say you didnt' want the excalibur class, well too bad, so sad, until you grind insane amounts in game to unlock other warframes/classes you're stuck with it. No starting over, no new guy. No start overs... While these decisions can be corrected witg 20-40 hours of gameplay (or immediate REAL CASH transaction) chances are as a new player you are immediately turned off by the game.  I know I am. Worthless tutorials in game, so you go to you tube and find out you made all the wrong choices, and you hav to dredge through 20-40 of crap to get what you wanted and start leveling that all over..... If a content creator doesn't care enough to let you start over from scratch or teach you anything about the game beyond WASD - Run - Jump and Mouse click, but also couples the learning curve with irreversible decisions. they don't deserve my vote or game time.  Pro's ------ it's shiny 90% of the cash shop is obtainable with in game grinding  Con's ----- crude global chat where you get Zero help only ridicule ridiculous lack of tutorial or effective explanation of what is supposed to be basic functions like EQUIPPING GEAR thoughtless and punishing early character design for new players Cash shop sells boosts and gear  My No vote is based on first impressions. Some people like strong moldy cheeses, but that's an acquired taste, this game is an acquired taste. I'm sure if I was to dump 40 hours in to it I may START to enjoy it.

Acts like a phone game.  -Melee is completely thoughtless it is just mash E until the enemy is dead and there is no form of strategy  -The guns are cool but take hours and some might take days to make. Also there could have been many more creative weapons especially more creative silent weapons other than the generic throwing knives and bows (which are actually the only silent weapons in the game. There are no silent guns or silent lasers that I know of.)  -The mods are cool although i wish there was a larger variety of mods instead of getting the same duplicates over and over  -Grinding was a pain because you would be doing different mission types but on the same map for each planet  -Stealth is only sub-par since the ai is blind and crouching is %100 pointless  -Stealth is not very rewarding due to no sneak dmg bonus or anything exciting  -Game is EXTREMLY glitchy and I exited the map multiple times within the first hour of playing.  -Dead bodies constanly glitch around from weapons with a large amount of impact  -The AI moves in such a poor pattern it is the equivalent of fighting mindless zombies. (there is no thought to them) I went against the AI they would take cover in plain sight. Some would run into walls. Some would be turned around starting at a wall while I was sneaking around. Some would slowly walk straight towards me or even avoid the 'strength in numbers' tactic. In games like this I want AI that is difficult because they are naturally difficult and not be difficult just because they are leveled up above the player.  -The game controls feel completely off with the keyboard but they dont feel much better with a controller either. I constantly found myself adjusting the controls and sensitivity just to get the right feeling but even then it felt like my mouse was on a slip and slide.  -The Warframes seemed to be really cool being able to cusomize the colors and all but note that ALL (but about 16 colors) were behind some form of pay wall. Even simple colors like black and white needed real money to be obtained.  -The three factions were pretty different from each other but the infested seemed a bit too easy.  -The small amount of pvp that I did felt completly meaningless although it was functional all I obtained were credits and no crafting materials. Not only that but there seemed to be nobody playing it unless it was because of my low ranking but even then I should have been able to find more than 1 game.  -There are limited inventory slots for weapons and warframes (armor) but the free inventory is super small and wants real money to be expanded to a thoughtful size.  -The community seemed to be mostly clean although I did not see many people typing in the regional and recruiting chat but I don't really think that can be judged or anything especially since I do not know the games playerbase. The only issue with the community is 1 guy that wanted to power level me from level 1 to whatever when I was still in my first hour of gameplay. Then he wouldn't leave me alone until I blocked him.  -Note that I only played for 24 hours and did not discover everything in the game.I also did not pay any real money.This review is just a hint on what you might encounter after your first few hours of gameplay.  ---Overall I feel the gameplay was decent but the missions were bad. I cannot give the game much more than a 6/10 and it is very ashamed because feeling of using a bow felt really fun and seeing the arrows fling people was also nice but the games missions and constant glitches kept me board. The only times I had fun was when I was trying to sneak around but the ai is so mediocre it made stealth way too easy. I dont feel that I can really recommend this game even though it is free, but if you have a lot of time on your hands that you want to throw out the window then this game will do it. Just prepare to be bored after an hour of playing. I also did not get a companion or archwing because I got too bored to continue the long grind.",

Everything is a grind. Warframes are obtained one piece at a time, from bosses. You just grind until each part drops once (average of 5 - 6 times total for three parts) and THEN you STILL buy the Blueprint from the market for in game currency.   And so it goes. All the best stuff in the game is free. It just requires hour and hours of endless RNG grind. Which wouldnt be so bad, except the game features a very limited selection of mission types, and in the late game forces you to run certain types for certain rewards - or, well, chances at rewards - whether you enjoy that type or not.   All of which is a shame. For a game this fun, with game play this exciting, to lean solely on RNG and exploitative business practices is a disappointment.",

Which ofcourse makes Aiming, very difficult, and melee no longer carries long combos, because targets only seem to be attacked, when in front of the player. Not to mention the Up the butt FoV! To top that off, we now must PAY for AW slots.. I spent 2 weeks prior to SotR farming every AW weapon, in order to better combat Jordas, to aquire Atlas. Since i didnt craft/claim them all, i now have to pay to use them.. Real money! Had i just accepted them prior, that would all be free! AW wasnt popular because rewards sucked, not because of controls.. And no ones going to pay for an unpopular, vomit inducing mode!  -The new map, while very astheticly pleasing, is not very intuitive. Theres no information that needs to be shown, and the nodes are tiny, and need to be hovered over, to find out what they are! It takes longer to access each panet, and node, as its so much larger.   -The market im 50/50 on. Its about the same, but hiding the BP behind Platinum was shady (has been fixed)  -The new Void Fissure system.. While i like being able to target things, and have 4 choices, were now using 4x more Relic/key than previously. No more key shares, and we now have MORE farming than ever! We now have dozens of kinds of relics, and ontop of those, must use Traces to increase drop chance of otherwise inaccessable parts. While we can all use 4 of the same relic, refined, theres no way to know if you have party members who are lying, or have even brought one, lessening the drop table for all.   -Then we have the fissure itself. A boring, tacked on, after thought! The exact same half ♥♥♥♥♥ extraction mission every. single. time. Compounded by Nullifiers, Bombardiers, and heavy gunners aglore, with low drop chance on the stupid put the ball in the hole game mode.. The old void maps were much better, and now have NO reason to go to it, other than, for the ONLY way to get Argon Crystals!  -Heavy Melee weapons now are immobile. When swingiong, it literally stop you in place, and enemies slowly walk backwards, safely staying out of range, all while pumping rounds into your character! I dont know why we needed pve changes, for the sake of pvp.. I HATE that!  -Tons of Bugs(yes theyll be fixed, but its worth mentioning, as this entire update was broken from top to bottom, and forced a complete revamp of majority of the game) its now so far less appealing, that many are abandoning the game.. I myself went from playing whenever i wasnt at work, to logging in, playing amatch or two, and logging out in disgust!  -Credits have been halved for rewards, Nullifiers buffed, Syndicate rep halved, and many resources seem to be far more difficult to obtain..(Ex: Oxium less drops, and i could swear Neurodes are deliberately avoiding me, because theyre what i most need. ive gotten 4 in the last 4 weeks)  -Veterans who had the entire solar system unlocked, find that they no longer hav fully unlocked planets, and must complete much of it again.  +Junctions.. I think these were neat, though i dont understand it from a lore persp[ective.. Whos controlling these tenno? Why are they fighting allied Tenno? -Still no tutorials, or explanations of ANYTHING! -To me, the difficulty seems to have spiked. Missions i used to steamrole, are now mopping the floor with me. I even died ina few missions in the late teens, early twenties! Theres plenty more, but its just overwhelming.. It went from a game i couldnt wait to get home and play, to a game that feels more like a chore.. The fun has been removed in many aspects.",

And you'd think that with mission types labeled as 'Assassination' and 'Spy' THere would be a good amount of stealth, right? WRONG! There is nothing in this game that can’t be brute forced with a little bit of speed and a good gun. The assassination missions are just kill/run past the dudes to fight a big dude, who is sometimes not a hard as the dudes who preceded them, and run to the exit. And the spy missions are more of the same. Kill/run past some guys, bruteforce a short stealth segment, and run to the end for loot.   As for the other mission types you have Extermination, Defence, Mobile Defence and interception. Extermination should be self explanatory, kill all the things. Defence is a gamemode where you defend a thing from the guys for 5 rounds and you repeat this 4 times for the best loot and bail. The mobile defence game mode is where you defend X points from the dudes all over the map and run to the exit when you’re done. And finally there’s Interception which is King of The Hill but with 4 points instead of 1.   Now luckily for us this game is early access beta and all of this will be fixed upon releasing their finished product.  Pfft, yeah right. This game has so much potential, or had. But somewhere DE started caring more about the money and less about their fans and product. They pay people to play their games and make their game look good, when there are blaring, obvious problems. Like recently they said they were trying to minimize grind so players didn’t get burned out. Now we are several updates past that and the grind is so much harder than before. It used to be you’d do a mission for a key that unlocked a special mission and you’d play that mission hoping for the reward you wanted. And you’d repeat that until you got the thing you wanted. Now you do a mission for a rock which unlocks a special mission and hope you get the reward you want. BUt now you can run more of these special rock missions to get another resource to alter the drop tables of these rocks and STILL not get the reward you wanted. Effectively not changing anything at best and at worst adding in more steps and more grind time.   Now how about we go on to the weapons. The weapons in this game are pretty fun. There’s a wide variety and something for almost anyone. Now there used to be a huge problem with weapon tiers, but with recent changes to the game almost any weapons with a few forma thrown into it can take on the entire universe and then some. But this has left people who grind out all this stuff without challenge. What’s the point of us having grinded out all these top tier weapons that can take a chunk out of the planet with the single squeeze of a trigger when Mr.Joeblow and his pump-action shotgun can do the same thing? Is it the gold bits on my gun? It’s gotta be the gold bits. It’s always been for the gold bits.",

The graphics are great and the skins look elegantly badass.   The intro to the game is very nice, I really like when games start of with me moving and killing things, only later to slowly introduce more indepth aspects to the game. This approach keeps me interested and prevents the overwhelming feeling of starting a game and not knowing how to do anything. This is very user friendly and balances learning and action nicely.  This game really allows the player to feel like a badass, the ingame action is really smooth and works very well. I am not sure how to say it other than it feels reallly nice. The fighting aspects of this game belong to a top end FPS. I particularly like how the sensitivity is set for aiming and turning, it really caters for snipers very well but may take an hour or so to really get used to it.  You can run on walls!  As far as the negative aspects to this game, i havent really encountered any but i can speculate. There is a market place where you can purchase ingame currency which i totally dont mind, it being a freegame and all. This is however a big threat to the game. I do believe this can be overcome but Sooo many games so far have not done so. I really hope it isnt, and I am not saying it is, But potentially Pay to Win.

Learning curve for the mods and eqipment levels isnt very hard. Graphics are good. Definately a F2P game, purchased items offer a some differences but nothing that completely overdoes it. 9.5/10 one of my new favorites.   ***************************UPDATED****************************************************************   The above review i wrote way back whever that was. Wanted to update my thoughts on this game.  I can't explain in words how addictive this game is. I would never have believed that a 3rd person shooter could be so good if I had not seen it for myself. The devs have added new content for clans, and are still very responsive to the player base. Graphics are superb. Just outstanding maps for the game. Music fits the game as well. It really puts you in the setting.   The thing I cannot stress the most is that fact that this is one of the EXTREMELY few TRUE Free2Play game that carries that title. 99% of the items in the marketplace are obtainable in game. And for that matter, you can sell Prime parts/blue prints or Mods to earn Platinum(currency used in the cash shop), thus, you can buy everything this game has to offer without spending a dime.   The only negative I can even think of is the player base itself. A small percentage of the players are your average trolls. This is nothing a gamer wont be used to by now. But for the most part (again prolly 90%) the players are very helpful, and will answer questions, help a new player with leveling, ect.   Don't short yourself by passing on this game. It's a real jewel, and a great achievement for the developers. The game is addicting on every level. If you havent played it yet, youve got nothing to lose. Download it and give it a go.",

            "review_text": "I've been playing this game since beta well over 600 hours. I also have RL friends that play which makes this game more enjoyable.    Cash shop  Warframe is a free to play game with a cash shop. the cash shop is for convenience if you don't have the time to put hours into it. You dont have to buy anything. 80% of the items can be obtained with time and effort without money. 10% are vanity items the other 10% is expansion slots so you can hold more ingame items but these are cheap. 12 platinum for 2 weapons slots and 20 platinum for 1 warframe slot.  The game  Third person 4 player co op game. main weapon, secondary weapon and a melee weapon. Run along walls up clifs or just teleport around. Nothings more fun than running around with friends and annoying them. Example my friend would run ahead to jump into a lift and start it without me but I'd use my switch ability as the lift door is closing and he'd have to wait for the lift to return while I laugh at him over the mic.  The game itself revolves around farming items like most other do. I need 2 circuits, 4 plasids, 100 alloy and 1 cell to create and new weapon (for example) so these items would be spread across 3 different type of missions to obtain them. The rarer the item the rarer the components are to get but they are not so hard you cant get them just time consuming.   Warframes  A Warframe (Class) is a suit which you can obtain in the game. Each Warframe has 4 abilities to make them stand out (other than just looks). Some are good for defence where others are damage dealers. To become good at end game finding a good mix of Warframes (Classes). There are over 21 Warframes now in game so there are plenty of options and variations to keep you interested even after 600 hours.  Modes  Defence, Survival, Exterminate, Capture and Sabotage are only some game types all are fun. There is plenty of story to keep you interested and more is added with each patch.   The Bad  If it wasn't for having RL friends it definately wouldnt be as fun to play. Also the grind can sometimes become boring. But if you do get bored there are other game modes you can play to obtain the same items when farming to keep things interesting just maybe not as efficient.  Will add more to this when I get chance lol  I do recommend this game though and if you want someone to play with add me 'Reigner' (in Warframe)    ",

The controls are a little difficult to get use to but not absolutely terrible and you can always customize them to an extent. My major gripes with the game is that it doesn't do a good job of explaining exactly what you're suppose to do or how to advance, which get really irratating if you don't have other players that can tell you how to move foward. Also it takes you forever to get anything, you starting weapons are weak and unless your willing to pay way too much in actual money it will take you days to get the blue prints and material you need, and even then you can't craft instantly as it take you half a day to make the weapon you want. Not to mention the stupid rank up system where you have to take a stupid test where you're restricted on what you can use which you can only take once every 24 hours. This is a complete and under waste of players time especially if you're like me and it says you failed after you did exactly as you were instructed to do.  There are a glitches, I did get stuck in a mission ending one where I got teleported outside the map and fell to my death with no way to respawn inside the map meaning I wasted a respawn token. Overall I'd give warframe a 3 out of 5, the gameplay is great and if you have friends it's particularly epic, but for me this is cut drastically due to the stupid amount of restrictions and time wasting aspects of the game. It's worth a download if your interested in playing with friends otherwise just pass on this one.",

Also, theres the fact that once you got everything in the game or almost, well... its pretty much over even though you can still play just for the fun of it. For me, i dont enjoy shootin' and killin' everything thats in my way just for the sake of it without getting any rewards. You basiclly have to wait for the Devs to add new stuff to the game.

Cool graphics require a very strong computer to handle(otherwise you'll be like me, on minimum settings, with a window so small i can't even read text anymore.) 11. Flawed trading system 12. New content does not fix underlying problems 13. Heavily unbalanced mods(Mods help your weapons/warframes) 14. Gameplay is not rewarding, unlocking new items is 15. Terrible tutorial(player lacks skills they need to survive(coptering)) 16. Gameplay revolves around bulldozing through fields of enemies to complete mission as quickily as possible 17.

Just to let you know, there are some missions it might get too dificult for solo so try making some friends in there. This is also not a completly finished game so they are doing updates and adding very nice features. Overall this is a very nice game and I do recommend this, so give it a shot!

Starting off is difficult, but if you have friends to play with and aid you, you'll easily get the things you need quickly, and you'll gain tonnnnnnnnns of materials over time. It has been getting updates quite frequently, so now is a good time to start.  The game has an AWESOME community, and has awesome developers, who stream frequently, show sneak peaks of futures updates, and give away FREE PLATINUM! (via Twitch's raffle feature). Platinum is the in-game 'special' currency, by the way. The items you craft do take a while, and some materials are difficult to gain *glares at Oxium* but overall, it's fun to work towards new and improved gear.   My only complaint is that it is Pay-to-Look-Good. Every color pallette is $4.99. However, there are discounted color pallette packs. The syandanas (or scarves, as some people may call them) are fairly cheap, but there are quite a few of them and each is about $2.00, and there are unique skins for weapons that are cheap.   Parkour is awesome as it is, but it could use some tweaking.  Overall, amazing game, if you have the time to play it.",

The various Warframes help in a variety of ways, and can play special roles as it goes up to 4 players which can make gameplay even better and possibly more fun and intense. The loot drop is very good in the way of not having people risking in losing said items, which makes the Co-op very toleerrable.  Beware of latencies though, as it may happen, ecspecially if you have bad internet/bad computer while hosting, or if you joined a public game that has said problem, which can make or break the game.

But what is this game and why should you care! Well a shooter to be percise with a mostly pve feel and future based theme. You play in a 'warframe' a battle suit for the 'tenno' minions of the lotus space ninja organization, that give you abillities to fight your enemies and health and shield so that when they fight back you don't get straight up murdered. Your enemies are the corpus (we have lazers), grineer (clones and bullets), and infested ('Technocyte' plague) at least till you start doing void missions.   The game is mission based, so you have a solar map and each planet has many mission that you can do of verying types. I won't name them all off but the basic ones would be survival, defence and exterminate (15 or so currently). The game has 3 different weapon slots main, secondary and melee, each with differnet weapon types like shotguns, rifles, revolvers, axes, maces and so on. Then you have your sentinal slot (mini floating robot) for sentinals or the newer kubrows (dogs), and lastly equipment slots for ammo resupplies and other gear.  Now lets talk about pimping out your frame and gear with the games upgrade system of mods. You find these in mission and or trade for them with other players and they have verying rarities of common, uncommon and rare. They give things like damage and defencive boosts but also can have special effects like the thunderbolt mod which give arrows a chance to explode on contact (there are hundered of different ones).   As for gameplay, your a space ninja so you can run, jump, wall run, backflick etc.... but the levels don't realy seem to give players all the room to do these things on a regular basis. Normally people just run and gun every mission ignoring all the flips and cool move they could do because the game doesn't require you to really do any of them. The gun play is great and melee while risky sometimes is quite fun and has a hard hitting feel. The main problem that I find is when playing with other your fun is host dependent as lag can be a problem.   Now lets look at the elephant in the room. This is a FTP (free to play) meaning you have to pay for certain things like extra arsenal weapon slots and warframe housing slots and sentinal slots and kubrow slots, etc...... also the orikin reactor and catalyst which are used to help get more mods on your frame and weapons (These can be gotten in game but very rarely like I have gotten 2 reactors and 4 catalyst in 3 months). There are also color scheme and other vanity items you can buy, and 'yes' the weapons also but it's easy to get them in game so I wouldn't waste your money.   For me this is a instant recommendation anyone. It's a 9/10 for me and a 8/10 in general if I was to look with out the rose tinted glasses. 'Well Worth Your Time and maybe money too'",

Although it is hard at first, once you start getting mods and different weapons and Warframes, the game will get much easier and much more fun.   Now the weapons are a true gem in variety. You can have a primary, secondary, and melee weapon. If you really want to you can take off your primary and secondary and just go full melee if you please. Just be warned though, flying enemies will be a burdon to try and kill if you're just doing melee only unless you have certain weapons. You can do this with every loadout if you want and it lets you level that weapon faster if you bring only that choice with you in missions. You can use your standard assault pew pew rifles, shotguns, snipers, bows, laser guns, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, energy swords, katanas for that true ninja feeling, whips, greatswords, claws F@$%ING CLAWS, and a ton of other types of weapons.  Now the Warframes. Every frame has their own set of abilities for different uses. My personal favorite is Loki as being used of more as a silent helper, but if you're a new player you get to choose from Excaliber the poster boy of Warframe, Volt the Sonic The Hedgehog of Warframe, and Mag the (in my opinion) 2nd most underated frame. My personal reccomendation is to do Volt because, honestly, he's the easiest to learn how to use out of the 3.   And what I feel should be all for this little review, microtransactions. C'mon let's face it, no F2P game can live without something to spend your money on, and this game doesn't force you to spend any unless you really want to. Platinum the 2nd type of currency in the game can be traded with other players or bought with real life money. Now while I admit the set prices are a bit ridiculous, but even this is made better. The game has a set Daily Log In Reward and your chances of getting something rare like discounts of up to 75% off platinum purcheses increased by logging on for at least 7 days at 8 PM EST (which would be my timezone, yours will vary). You can buy weapons and frames if you wish, but I wouldn't as you can literally farm everything in the game except cosmetics which are the only things really worth buying with platinum aside from highly needed things like Orokin Reactors and Catalysts.  In short, this game is worth at least checking out. After all, it is free.",

            "review_text": "Pros: - The graphics and controls are spot on.  - Fluid combat that can be extremely satisfying. - Ninjas - The cash shop is actually better then in most games. Were most are pay-to-win, almost everything can be earned through grinding in the game. Also, since the game is designed around a Co-op style of play, buying Warframes and Weapons only helps out your group. - Expanding inventory of Warframes and Weapons.  Neutral: - This didn't bother me, but I understand it can bother some, so I didn't count this as a pro or a con. Since you can grind and earn almost everything, there is a pretty good wait before things you make can be used. Weapons are not to bad(12 hours), but a Warframe takes quiet a bit of time to make(3 1/2 days if you make the components at the same time, then the Warframe). With Platinum, you can complete any project instantly, so if you spend a little money in the game, and use it to craft instead, you can spend far less money then just buying the Warframes outright in some cases.  Cons: - Depending on your graphic settings, lag can get pretty intense with some of the missions, considering the number of enemies that can be in your field of view with powers being used from every direction. - Sometimes the game picks the worst person to host while in a group.  I regret taking so long to actually pick this game up and play it. It's free, so I really had no excuse besides other games had my attention. It's not for everyone, but hell, it's free. Give it a try. You may find you you spend a lot more time on it then you'd ever of expected.",

Oh yes, there's a lot of content for Warframe. 10 hours will get you nowhere. It's pretty much just enough to make an educated impression. So what did I get out of it?  Warframe is not for everyone. It wasn't for me, either.   That doesn't mean it's bad, far from it. The game just absolutely hates showing the player why it's good. The basic mechanics give so much agency to the players, allowing them to bounce off walls and slide through packs of enemies, slashing and shooting the entire way. But it doesn't tell you how to pull off the most advanced moves or what's actually useful. The world map lets players fight through incredibly varied missions and locales throughout the solar system. But good luck getting there with the unintuitive and vague map. The F2P mechanics, while grindy, allow free players to fully use the incredibly deep crafting and loot system from the very start. But it doesn't explain how to use the alarmingly complex crafting system. When I say alarmingly complex, I mean that blueprints must be bought or found so you can grind the crafting materials so you can pay credits to craft the weapon so you can wait 24 hours to get your new, unleveled weapon.   None of that is explained. Not even the part where some weapons and items need other weapons or items as crafting materials, which also require blueprints for crafting.  To close, the bad outweighed the good for me, but it's free. Try it for yourself. You may just enjoy the third-person-loot-based-space -ninja-simulator genre.",

Pros: - Best co-op game available for the PC. - Great graphics, good sound. - Great combat feeling, unrivaled actually. - A lot of long term goals to aim for. - Crafting and modding is fun, always a sense of achivement.  Cons: - Learning curve is tough, not EVE tough, but ... tough. - Slightly repetetive when playing for several hours straight. - Playing solo can be rough (Though the default option is to be paired with random players)  Overall, my favourite game since 35 hours of gameplay.",

And it's not pay to win, though dropping 20 bucks to support the developers and take a few shortcuts was well worth the money.   This game is probably the closest thing PC will have that's similar to Monster Hunter.  The formula is basically the same. To get better stuff, you have to go do missions.  Different missions has a chance to drop certain things.  Acquire certain things, build better weapons and level up your warframes.   My favorite parts about this game is Survival and Defense missions, but more so survival.  I do wish that survival focused on staying alive as long as possible instead of maintaining your 'life support'.  I'm sure the developers made it this way so players can't just camp and use Line of Sight to take down targets.   Bad parts about this game? New players will definitely need to ask seasoned players for a lot of advice and guidance and explanation.  It's easy to 'get lost' and not know what to do next.  You're going to have to research a lot of stuff basically.   This game is also harder to solo, which is certainly a flaw for me.  I don't like having to rely on teamwork to accomplish things.  Certain warframes can easily solo while other warframes just don't have the abilities to do so.   But many players do solo successfully and they probably have a better time, so don't be scared off. Solo is definitely doable, I just wish the game catered a bit more to it.   Anyways, download the game and have a great time.",

However, it can also be effectively played with the melee weapons in the game; they range from large axes and hammers, to dual wielded daggers and specialty items.   Overall, the game is quite an enjoyable experience. The main drawback is the time it takes to build items.

After getting everything to lvl 30 and getting my but kicked on some difficult missions with enemies half my ldevel I am glad I didn't spend any money. Could be a lot more fun if the devs worked on the game itself and not dumbing down the graphics on the level selectiuon screen! I saw a video of what it looked like at the beginning of 2014 and it was WAY better than it is now. The level selection screen is one of the most basic and boring interfaces I have seen simply due to poor layout. Enough bashing it though, thats the worst of the game, it plays well and it only gets repetitive after putting in 20+ hours, so its good fun at first.

            "review_text": "I've been playing for over a year now and here's my honest opinion on this game.  Pros:  -Fast-paced, fun gameplay.  -Tons of playstyle options. (Many unique and interesting weapons designs and Warframes.)  -Amazing art style and graphics in general, very unique.  -Easy to learn, hard to master.  Cons:  -While there are many weapons options, many of them are not viable past the early parts of the game. Weapon balance needs some serious tweaking, but it looks like they're seeing this and starting to work on it now.  -It can be an absolute grindfest. RNGesus pretty much runs this game as all the parts for the higher end weapons and warframes are random drops that can take many tries to acquire. (Not a huge problem because even the grindiness can be a lot of fun.)  -Each Warframe that you can play as has 4 abilities that are generally fun and unique. However, almost all of them have one or two abilities that are either very weak, or too situational to see much, if any use. (As with the weapons, it looks like the devs are starting to finally see this problem and have started trying to rework some of the Warframes to make them more useful.)  - My personal biggest annoyance with this game: Many of the damage-oriented Warframes have abilities that fall off, or become less useful in high level gameplay. This is because they use base damages that do not scale up as high as enemy armor and hp values do, taking away a lot of fun gameplay for those of us who enjoy the most challenging aspects of the game.  All in all, it's a super fun game that I absolutely recommend to anyone. Most of my concerns are slowly being addressed and the game seems to be moving in a really good direction. It can be a little confusing at first, but if you do some research and talk to some people, it turns into a huge amount of fun. Give it a try, you won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "Before i say anything, let me be clear, this is a very good game and i do fully reccomend it.  Now that that's out of the way, i do have problems with it. For one, the corpus are impossible to stealth through (which honestly just makes it all the more satisfying to kill them with any for of stealth, but i digress). They are a swarm of 20 or so different types of enemies ranging from typicaly gunners to chargers to assault walkers and just about anything else you can think of. This is no longer as big of a problem because the difficulty shift between corpus and grineer factions has been balanced with added grineer (unless the grineer napalm and bmbardier types dont show up in the starter worlds).  second grievence, crafting can be grindy as all hell. For as balanced as it can be (it takes lots of credits or resources that are hard to get to obtain high-rank things without paying), there is the problem that you can't upgrade your starter bow, should you choose it, until you get to saturn, which is quite a ways away from start, while you can just outright buy an upgraded rifle with enough credits.  final grievence, parkour can be at times clunky and glitchy. Example, in one grineer-style room are pillars that you are supposed to climb in order to reach the catwalk the next level. climbing these can be quite a challenge as they are not registored as flat sufaces to run on, making it harder to get up to previously mentioned catwalk.   Other than these, the game excels quite far. The combat is responsive and feels right, all the weapons feel like they're suppose to function as they do (at least the ones i've managed to use) and, in terms of looks, the game is beutiful, the orokin void especially. multiple times have i just stopped my rampage through them to admire the detail and thought put into them.  As a game, warframe functions almost perfectly into it's genre of sci-fi, but not so much into the ninja-stealth game it claims to be. however it can be a stealth game in many occasions should you get lucky to find someone who doesn't try to speed run levels or just go headlong into everything.",

            "review_text": "At first I would have recommended it for newcomers. I played the game nearly everyday until the weapon update that came out many months ago, but before that warframe twas a glorious game! Being a veteran in this face paced challenging awesome game, I was crushed to see the system make silly accommodations for newbs. Yes this sounds cruel but hear me out. Before this horrible weapon update if you wanted to shoot an enemy you could simply push the 'shoot' button if you wanted to melee the enemy with your tricked out sick status effecting weapon(s) you would simply push your 'attack' button and for greater melee damage you would just simply hold the said melee attack button doing a charged animation attack. It was simple and effective, but people complained about the weapons not having enough damage for their combo hits so they took out the charged attack altogether... Never mind the best of both worlds they threw the charge attack out and added a system where you have to toggle/shift into melee mode. This was a very unninja change to the war/chaotic flow of what made Warframe a great game. Now your shooting stance has a incredible weak excuse of what a melee attack should/used to be, your melee stance however can be equipped with a mod that causes you to do a flashy combo. So to recap.  Old Warframe shooting/melee/charged attacks at the ready at all times. Melee usually had 3 animations but that may have been just for heavy melee, light melee weapons may have had more. (I didn't use many light weapons) you could charge with both.  New Warframe Shooting mode: able to shoot and includes reduced (animation and damage) melee attacks. No charge attack  Melee Mode: no shooting available you can unleash a cool looking combo if you have the right mod on your weapon but only 1 'combo mod' can be equipped at a time. No charge attack  So in short they took out a useful charge attack, and made combat slower with these toggle modes, and added a flashy combo per weapon+mod. All because ppl were complaining about melee attacks (excluding charged) being weak. I think the ppl they aimed to accommodate simply didn't know how to mod their weapons effectively.  All who played before that update lost more than they gained.   If you are a newcomer however, you wont know the pain of going from awesome warframe to a sub par version of warframe. The only reason I don't recommend it is for fear that they may nerf the player experience again via appeasing the loud, rather than the gamer.  Think about it, they could have added the flashier combos and kept charged attacks w/o implementing an extra step for their players but instead they didn't.",

            "review_text": "If you like shooters, and you like customization, and you like to have it for free, get this game. I will admit I am a casually paying player, and will get into what you DON'T get in the CONS section. I will state right now that the only things in the cash shop you cannot get by farming are some of the cosmetic items, and INVENTORY SPACE.  Warframe is what they say it is - Space Ninja online 3rd person shooter. The game is room-based (i.e. NOT open world), and is almost exclusively PVE. There are a number of different missions you can do, such as infiltration, sabotage, assassination and more. Matchmaking is either random, or with friends. The missions are set in randomized stages, and commonly have one or more enemy type - there are three 'armies' in the game, and each has a variety of enemies.  The randomizing engine keeps you from being bored when having to run the same stage over and over again, especially when you are farming something hard to get. That is not to say there aren't any 'premade' rooms - sometimes these rooms repeat more than once in a certain stage.  Okay, that's basically what you do in the game. Now let's talk about what you have to do it with.  The player character is a 'Warframe', a biomechanical exosuit with powers. It's what you might call the 'Class' of the character. It is treated as equipment, and is freely interchangeable if you have more than one. Each 'frame has four powers that are associated with its role in the group, with the 4th typically being a huge damage AoE with a high energy cost (there are some exceptions to this).  Additional equipment includes a primary weapon, sidearm, melee weapon, and a 'pet' thing. You can also get a dog, but I don't have one so I won't talk about it.  Each piece of equipment is leveled individually, by usage (taking it to missions). As it levels, it becomes slightly more powerful, and also gains more slots for Mods. Warframe mods focus around movement, survivability, energy, and weapon use. Weapon mods can often change the way a weapon works entirely (Poison gas grenades anyone? Explosive arrows? Lightning bullets?). These mods also have levels, and are improved by sacrificing other mods.  At this time, the game has about 20 Warframes (Maybe a bit less), and over a HUNDRED substantially different weapons. I don't even want to count the mods. Did I mention customization?  This is where it gets tricky. Some of the more advanced weapons require a 'Mastery Level' - which is gained by leveling frames and weapons. To gain access to the most 'advanced' weapon (ML 8 at this time I believe), you need to master about 6 frames and 10 or 15 types of each weapon. As a free user, you get only 3 inventory slots for each type of equipment - This means you will have to have a favorite set, and other weapons you buy or craft will have to be mastered, then deleted. I positively despise games that make you pay for inventory, so if I wasn't a paying user, this might've been a deal-breaker for me.  The variety of different things you can see and experience in this game is HUGE, but unfortunately this can only do so much for immersion, especially if you are randomly matched with a high level player that simply rushes the entire stage killing everything in one hit. The endgame is also kind of mediocre-, being a constant zerg rush of enemies that slowly increase in level and amount. Still, I recommend this game. It is a positive experience as an action game, and most people can find something they like in the constantly increasing customization options.  Oh, and something I didn't mention: This game has active developers. That's right - people that listen to your woes and fix the game accordingly. They are truly awesome and skilled, as apparent in the end result.  So, to sum it up:  PROS: + High quality action with flying guts and blood + Huge amount of customization options + Responsive world with an excellent physics engine + Everything for sale can be found in-game, except inventory and appearance items. There is NO item that can be bought from the shop that strengthens a paying player over a free one. + Active developers and great support + Awesome graphical design + Great boss battles that require teamwork to succeed + Melee combat is so well thought out, it can replace ranged combat completely. Machinegun or sledgehammer, or actually why not both? + Great events with event-only loot  CONS - Endgame is kind of repetitive. But since it's an action game this might not be that bad. - Inventory can only be bought for money. Completionists will suffer. - Event-only loot cannot be found later. Ever. Completionists will suffer. - The playerbase encourages rushing of stages, which severely impacts immersion - Almost no PVP - Crappy trading system. Expect having to find most things by yourself.  At least try Warframe. Ninjas play free.",

It legitimantely puts your skill over equipment level to win battles, unmatched by many other games who claim to have this balance. But better equipment does help speed up the killing, other then that, you can go to any level with what ever equipment you so desire and finish it, even if your gear is new level, with or without modifications.  The equipment makes each person unique. When I look around the net and stumble upon people asking 'What weapon or warframe should I use?' and the majority of the answers are along the lines of 'Whatever suits you best.' This holds true, as you can use a number of weapons, such as bows, swords, staffs, fully or semi-automatic rifles and pistols, and many other weapons, mainly influenced by the western and the far east arsenal. Which different people are more proficient with whatever equipment suits their style of play.  Any other info to get the idea of the game is, that you can craft stuff at a spot around your ship, have a companion to fight with you, join clubs formally called syndicates, start or join a clan and form alliences, oh and quite importantly! You can perform Freerun/Parkour/Agility around the land scape. Now with the new update, manouvering really takes the meaning 'The sky is the limit.' literally and has really taken my breath away, along with elevators and Excalibur's super jump.  The overall quality of the game is beautifully shaded, polished, and even replaced multiple textures, sounds, and physics, to where my computer started generating some more heat then in the beta, but still runs very smoothly. Though, I do have a slight irratation because of how darkened some tilesets have become compaired to your Warframe in the enviroment.

Clan's also come with a clan dojo, which can be heavily customized into literally a personal hangout place or even a base of operations. You can put statues, trees, ponds, bridges, laboratories, hallways, a dueling area, trading post's, etc and many, many other things in your or joined clan dojo's  You pretty much got the idea of it, a lot of customization is in this game. There's also various mods you can put on your warframe, as well as weapon's, companion's stuff like that which can increase the stats of whatever the hell you put it on. Ex. The mod 'Vitality' grants more Health. 'Redirection' (I believe) grants more Shield's You can also go to a large selection of planet's too. I only got around 6-8 planet's on my navigation that I can go to, each with 15-23-ish mission's, and I still don't have all of them.   Though there's a lot of plus sides to this game, the most frequent and annoying things I keep running into would be lag and difficulty. If you don't have a generally good system, your gonna have a good amount of lag (Obviously, yes I know. I'm just saying). Sometimes, it just likes to lag I don't know. Then with the difficulty, there are some mission's that (my belief) are literally impossible to do by yourself....just can't be done. Friends are a very lovely thing you'll definitely want with you in some of your mission's or putting your lobby to public for randoms, doesn't really matter. I would get into item grinding, but with these type's of games it's honestly expected, so. Btw, you don't start out with a lot of color choice's. You need to use actual money for Platinum to get different color's and color scheme's. Everything else you can get with Platinum if you want, but everything I've seen so far (including other warframe's) have blueprints if you don't feel like using money. Be warned, you'll be grinding A LOT. Though if your lucky, you'll get them pretty easily.   Moral of this review is: If you like Third-Person Co-Op Shooter's w/a Hack-and-Slash ability, and you don't mind that occasional ungodly lag spike w/minor rage fits...then give Warframe a try. Hell it's free-to-play and in my mind, one of the better free games you can get. (Didn't mean to spoil anything about it for you, but trust me I haven't even got to some of the good stuff. You'll just have to play it in order to find out more then, won't cha?)  ",

        {
            "review_text": "There are so many things about the game and the company that make it one of my favorite games I've ever played.  The gameplay is deceptively complex, and while players can spam abilities and shoot with abandon on most planets, the higher-level play relies heavily on teamwork and composition, as well as conservation of resources. Staying in a survival mission for an hour, for example, requires that every team member be able to quickly and consistently kill the constantly scaling enemies while still replenishing the ticking life support meter, which, as more and more time passes, becomes increasingly difficult. After about 35 minutes, the enemies are twice the maximum player level and spawn about 15 new units several times per minute. The mass of bullets and bad guys is almost incomprehensible, and even when they die, they rarely drop anything useful. Without a Nekros Warframe to loot the bodies of the dead enemies, ammo and life support are scarce commodities. Without heavy area-of-effect damage dealers like Nova, Mirage, and Mag, enemies would overwhelm the team and the mission would be lost. Without heavy tanks or stealthy rogue Warframes like Rhino, Loki, Ash, or Frost, reviving allies and activating life support (which requires a three second channelling time) becomes next to impossible. It's a tactical and action-packed frenzy.  There are now more than twenty different playable 'characters,' each with unique skills and stats. There is a Warframe for every player, from supports to run-and-gunners, tanks to backstabbers. There are also more than 150 unique weapons to build and collect, including some truly unique weapons, unlike anything I've ever encountered. Gas emitters, laser welders, automatic dart guns, goo guns, and even a few rifles that shoots saw blades make the thirteen-year-old boy in me that invented a saw gun when I was supposed to be taking notes giggle with delight.  What makes this game special is more than just the game mechanics, though. The developer, a company called Digital Extremes, is absolutely committed to providing the absolute best experience for their player-base. The game is free-to-play, but unlike so many of its contemporaries, it does not follow the pay-to-win model. Everything gameplay-related is obtainable through in-game work, and even some of the cosmetic items are obtainable through special 1-hour 'alert missions.' They regularly give away credit boosters, experience boosters, exclusive event weapons, and color customization options for free or, since their parent company, Perfect World, doesn't allow 'free' items, for 1 credit of in-game currency (each mission typically nets around 15,000 credits). They listen to the concerns and desires of the players on the forums, and tailor the game to fit the community. They provide amazing customer service to players who experience bugs in-game, and even to those who make mistakes that are their own fault. At the beginning of my Warframe tenure, my friend accidentally bought an icon pack believing it was an alternate helmet, and when he asked the helpdesk for a refund, they not only gave him his money back, but they let him keep the icon pack. They continuously surprise and delight me with their service to the community, and in return, they have a fiercely loyal and fervent player base. When the game was first in open beta, they were selling a Founder's Pack that included a custom Warframe and weapon set called 'Excalibur Prime,' which was (and remains to this day) the only Warframe that was exclusively obtainable by paying for it. Those who bought the highest level of Founder loyalty, the Grand Masters, got their gamer IDs listed in-game on the planet of their choice, as well as access to the 'community design council,' who would eventually single-handedly design and produce a number of weapons and Warframes. These fans and players make the game an absolute pleasure to play, and as it is an online game where players are often teamed with complete strangers, it is crucial to the game's playability that its players are at least approachable.  The player base of Warframe is easily one of the friendliest, least horrible groups of people I've ever had the opportunity to be a part of. I am consistently impressed by the support for new players, the intolerance for bad behavior, and the sense of community that the players of Warframe exhibit, and despite the fact that the player base has grown dramatically in the last few months (due to the PS4 and XBox One releases as well as advertizing), the average quality of play has not decreased. The toxic, horrible people that tend to frequent online worlds are just not tolerated in Warframe. It's amazing and refreshing.  Among the list of incredible features of this game is one of my favorites: The game isn't even finished yet. The Digital Extremes dev team is working tirelessly to complete the game, and even though it's in its 16th (and change) beta release, the game is always changing and growing more complete. Every Wednesday they release updates to the PC version, and the person behind the in-game update notifications possesses an ingenious knack for comedy and joy, making the usually dreaded update crash a tolerable (and dare I say fun?) experience.",

Find a clan, work together, trade parts, run missions, fight bosses. You 'prestige' your warframe and add 'polarization' so that certain mods cost half price and you can beef that b**** up even more! Tons of different warframes to choose from to completely play whatever style you want. Stealth with Loki (primitive stealth gameplay), Crush and pull enemies with Mag, Torch people with Ember, go Invulnerable with Valkyr and rip mofos apart like Voldo in soul calibur (no 'cutscene' kills, i say that loosely, except for finishers and stealth kills). Freeze enemies, electrocute them, mind control them, just tear them apart however you can. Most warframes have a prime version, so don't polarize until you can get it. Best part about it? You don't HAVE to spend your actual money if you don't want to! But it's fun, so don't judge me. Play it, Love it, Hate yourself, and HAPPY KILLING!!",

Now the game is about ninjas like Naruto is about ninjas. You are not someone meant to be patient and stealthy old splinter cell style. You are a giant krakken summoning, fireball casting, sound wave emitting bad ♥♥♥ that doesn't know the first word of stealth. Even the characters built for stealth are better off using them to just blow through levels. I know, everyone wants to be the bad ♥♥♥, but this game was about space ninjas. Now its not and I can't help but feel it lost part of itself along the way for more popular appeal. I cannot recommend the game, you are not a ninja and if ninjas play free then why do you push your pay to play items in my face all the time?  Instead of being about stealth now, its a MMO grindfest of gathering materials for recipes and farming recipes from bosses. Have fun as this is gets boring really quick.",

The gameplay is enjoyable to say the least, although it kinda runs away from the super stealthy space ninja aspect rather quickly, becoming a semi standard TPS in a matter of seconds. The combat is kinda samey, yet manages to still keep you interested enough to play through the vibrant levels. Warframe is a good looking game, drawing the many vibrant and beautiful alien landscapes of Halo and destiny, whilst still retaining its personality. The story? Its kinda weird and I still don't understand it but I'll try and relay it in a good fashion. You are an Orokin or something like that, and you wear a warframe (a fancy ninja suit that is all glowy and cool). You have recently been awoken from a very long nap and some damn ugly alien dudes are like 'we like putting stuff on legs' so they put the aspirin or something very similar on your leg. but then you're like 'my legs are mine' and start killing people, so beginning the adventure of *USERNAME*.  8/10  (would be a 9 if the names were memorable) 9/10  Changed my mind, I realized there were two names I remembered, oberon and loki.

            "review_text": "Warframe is a multiplayer third-person Sci-Fi PvE action shooter. You take the role of a Tenno, a mysterious race of beings that equip themselves with biomechanical combat suits called Warframes.  Pros: - Fast paced and fun action - Solid gameplay mechanics - Unique premise and art style - Very fair F2P business model - Developers extremely active and friendly with community - Developers constantly updating and adding new content  Cons: - Little to no actual game narrative - Enemy AI is completely unremarkable - Despite claims of being 'space ninjas', stealth options are near nonexistent - Many rewards locked behind steep pRNG 'grindwalls' (earning it's nickname 'Warfarm') - A lot of content remains in game but serves little purpose     In depth:  It is easy to see why Warframe has a large and very loyal following across three platforms: It is fun, intuitive, and has just the right amount of complexity to encourage theorycrafting without boring more casual audiances. The developers (Digital Extremes) are constantly updating the game and interact heavily with the community.    So how does the game work?  You are a Tenno. A mysterious race of ninja-like beings. So mysterious, in fact, that the Tenno do not even know what they themselves are. These Tenno are unique in the world in that they have the capability to control these biomechanical combat suits called Warframes. You can equip a vast array of Warframes with different abilities that suit various roles, as well as a vast assortment of primary weapons, side arms, and melee weapons.  Warframe statistics and abilities range in a glorious cornucopia, suiting the playstyle of just about anyone. Weapons come is many of the usual flavours such as assault rifles and shotguns, but there are also a handful of extremely unique weapons concepts. Melee combat shows a unique level of depth for a shooter, allowing you to equip only a melee weapon and complete combo chains sometimes reminiscent of a spectacle fighter.  There are also a various array of 'pets' that assist you in combat, from the 'Sweeper' sentinel that blasts enemies that gets to close with a shotgun and sucks up nearby item drops to the dog-like Kurbows that can chase down and tear your enemies apart.  There is a vast array of ways to customize the modifications to the Warframe, weapons, and pets. This allows customizing everything from additional damage and defense to adding elemental effects or augmenting Warframe abilities with unique mechanics. These modifications are represented as card-like items (simply called 'mods'), that themselves can be upgraded to increase the effect they provide.  Confusing, though, is the sheer amount of what many veteran Warframe players consider to be 'junk mods'. Essentially, mods that offer little if no benefit to players due to abnormally low bonus values or arbitrary benefits that are too conditional to be objectively seen as useful. Considering that Warframes, weapons, and pets have a finite number of 'slots' with which to fill with 'mods' (ranging from eight to ten, specifically), these 'junk mods' only really serve to dilute pRNG drop tables, adding a level of annoyance in a perpetual 'grindwall' that only serves to alienate many players.     The damage system brilliantly simple but complex, having three 'physical' damage types (Impact, Puncture, Slash) and four elemental damage types (Heat, Cold, Electric, Toxin), each with strengths and weaknesses against various enemy types. The elemental damage is expounded further with the ability to 'combine' elements to create yet another set of new elemental types (Blast, Corrosive, Radiation, Magnetic, Gas, Viral). I have yet to see a game that goes quite this in depth with a damage system, yet still manages to keep it simplified enough so it does not overwhelm. Of all the elements to stand out in a game, this seriously surprised me.   The gameplay itself is fast-paced and extremely satisfying, allowing you to play your own particular style and not feel left behind. While the premise on paper shows a large degree of repetition and has no real story, the gameplay definitely keeps you playing far longer than one would expect a multiplayer RPG-esque game with no actual story elements. There is enough various game types ranging from standard endless wave defense to more interesting 'Spy' and 'Rescue' missions.  Unfortunately, the fun gameplay will only keep you starry-eyed for so long. The developers do try to constantly update and run events to keep things fresh, the lack of story content begins to show the hollowness of the universe. While more recent updates to the game have begun to fill this void with a 'questing' system, there is serious questions as to why it would take this many years to write a story for a game with such heavy RPG elements. Even games famous for their online communities such as Call of Duty spend serious time into the game's narrative. There is also strangely a distinct lack of stealth elements aside from two of the dozens of Warframes possessing an 'invisibility' skill, despite these Tenno supposedly being 'space ninjas'.    There is a vast array of enemies, from the basic level infantry types, to heavy machine gunners, to the obligatory bosses. There are even elite 'hunter' enemies that will randomly spawn in the level intent to assassinate you if you have merited their feared 'Death Mark'. Bosses show some unique premise, ranging from heavy armoured military generals to insanely nimble robotic 'hyenas'.  Unfortunately, the enemy AI is very simplistic on all but boss encounters, and even then the AI is mediocre. Most basic enemies will literally stand in front of you, dumbfounded, as you cut down their allies. A few may take cover, but little else. None flee in terror of the almighty killing machine that is decimating their numbers, and more importantly, there is little to no group tactics. No feints. No sneaky flanking enemies using their more heavy allies as a diversion. No use of cover-fire-and-advance tactics used by basic infantry. With the endless droves of enemies being thrown at you, it would be nice to see difficulty defined not just by and increase in damage output and defenses, but also in intelligence.    Now, with all Free2Play games, there is always the concern over the business model. Happily, Digital Extremes does it right. There is a 'premium' currency that one can pay real money for called Platinum. The only thing exclusive to buy with Platinum is aesthetic/cosmetic items. They do occasionally release 'Prime Access' packs that give you a sum of Platinum with special Warframes, weapons, and gear. You can even purchase normal weapons, Warframes, and pets with Platinum (albeit this is not recommended due to the high Platinum costs for these items).  However, all Warframes, weapons, and mods are available without Platinum. Furthermore, Platinum is tradable with other players, meaning that extremely valuable items your just received for which you have no use can be turned into Platinum by selling it to another player. Most importantly, however, is that no items purchased with Platinum give a particular 'competitive edge', if one could be fathomed in a PvE multiplayer game.    In conclusion, Warframe is an amazingly game that throws together elements of traditional shooters and RPGs in a sublime balance of fun and complexity, with fast-paced action and wonderous gameplay mechanics and graphics.  However, this game does suffer from extreme repetitive gamplay, due to a confusing lack of story to motivate players onward, an abhorently unremarkable enemy AI, and the absurd amount of grinding that puts some of the worst MMOs to shame (earning the infamous nickname 'Warfarm').  Fortunately, the developers seem to keenly listen to their players, and the unparalleled level of interaction from it's developers definitely shows a bright future is ahead.",

Me? Nah, that's crazy talk), the community is quite friendly and helpful, and joining a random group is a relatively painful process. A handful of whiny norms (okay, maybe just a little annoyed) is a small price to pay for an excellent third person shooter with a nice variety of weapons, powers, and some truly impressive locals. The free to play is true; you can get pretty much everything in the store through the game if you are patient; you can even trade extra mods and rare parts in the trade channel to earn platinum (the currency normally you'd have to pay for), giving you access to the pay stuff without actually having to pay money.  Mind you, I'd still recommend going into this game with 1-3 other players, as it is more fun with friends.",

There are also lots of different types of charecter types that you chose from such as the Rino Warframe which is a pure tank and also my favorite. There are also Prime versions of some Warframes. These are upgraded versions of their corresponding lesser. Speaking of upgrades, there are hundreds of weapon and Warframe upgrades to chose from that you aquire through completing various missions.

Now hopefully more and more content will be added. To give us more to do other that get weapons/stuff just for the sake of it. Unfortunatly the Devs lately have been wasting time with PVP and screwing with a star map that doesn't need screwing with. Just make more maps/tiles/planets/enemies and we will be happy. I would love to see more progression for progression sake rather than for RNG drops.  Everything about this game is great and no other game makes you feel like such a badass, a fantastic control system is the reason for this and it's only getting better. Play this game for fantastic gunplay with (contrary to other reviews I'm seeing) a fantastic assortment of Weapons that all play very different. Many games weapons are just re=skins but not here.  Then of course the Warframes, The grind is real but nothing feels as good as getting all your parts finally then having 'Ready to Collect' in your foundry, then going onto the field and seeing what powers you have, how they will come into play. They make it very tactical. There are many players who build one way per frame according to Meta. Screw that, they can be a boring spreadsheet artist, I'm gonna have fun and use everything I have.

You pick 1 of 3 warframes at the beginning of the game and start level up. Not just him your Primary weapon, secondary weapon, melee weapon too.  And Leveling up is really rewarding. You can pick from massive amount of mods to improve your arsenal. You can build guns. And find its components from massive numbers of missions from numerious beautifully designed places.  Everything feels so different and effective so that it really connects you to the game and make wonder 'how about i do this and this?'.    And missions are so much fun.  You maybe wondering how pvp is and thinking about downloading a pvp game. Well you can do pvp but you will have much more fun at co-op missions especially 'defend' missions where enemies comes in waves and you try to hold out just to get your wanted mod.

Pros: This game fulfils every childhood dream of being a ninja and an astronaught at the same time; I personally spent five minutes running back and forth across the map with Warframe's parkour system which allows the player to traverse areas smoothly and quickly without hampering gameplay.   Cons: The only downside I found while playing Warframe was the Archwing missions. It's a really cool idea to be able to fly around in space and fight enemies, but this mechanic is executed poorly with mostly repetitive defense or exterminate missions; thankfully there is only one archwing mission per planet, and even then they are optional.    In conclusion, Warframe is the perfect free-to-play MMO for any sci-fi junkies who want a game literally about space ninjas or just to hang with friends within Warframe's many hub areas. ",

And not to mention the griding and waiting that gets old just to get one item. There are many cool Warframes (charatcers) to choose from but they only let you choose from three (out of 20-somthing and counting) in the begining of the game. Which was a total let down for me since I DIDN'T like the first three warframe they let me choose form (I WANTED TO START AS FROST). And bossed are kind of plain and some are just annoying (F-ing Vey Hek gave me head ache casue he is SO ♥♥♥♥♥ ANNOYING PEICE OF SHIEEET)  So why am I recomending this game? Well this game is one of the well crafed game I've ever played. Thight and fluent control, high speed action, diversity, and beutiful grafics. the control does take time to get used to but when you do you'll be running, jumping sliding and killing like a ninja, if feels fantastic. You will feel like a total bad-♥♥♥, killing everybody that foolish enough to get in your way. And it is constantly updating bringing new things to the table. Each warframe is unique and just by changing one warframe to another it can alter the game play. The guns are usually very satisfying to shoot each gun have unique characteristic that motivates you to get more guns.   Although it is a HUGE grind fest it is definately not a pay-to-win game like other F2P games; you can get all of the items they offer in the game(except for some exception **frost prime**) it just take... grinding. Yes they do have a market where you can pay real money to instantly get what you want but I say it's not as invasive as other games.   but here's the complain I have that I don't see from other players. The sound tract is kind of dull. I guess I'm not used to that kind of music but I always wish that they put a music that gets me PUMPED during the battle. the music here is just another 'dark omnius' music. Yes it is appropriate for the setting in some extent and it is no where near bad but nothing special. Most of the time I find myself turning off the music and put on sound tract from Metal Gear Rising or Undertale as BGM, which to me works better setting the mood of bad-assness.   Over all it is NOT a perfect game but it sure is a great game (easily one of my favorite game). It have it's flaws but it does make up for it. Plus it's free. Just give it a try and let the world of Warframe consume your life!! Like it't doing to me.",

            "review_text": "I have played this game for 2 - 3 years and have recently stopped playing. The game is very grindy resulting in burn out and frustration. There are other problems on top of it. Over time for myself and other vets I know the game has become nothing more than a fitting simulator.  - Players are only willing to do the same thing over and over again before it starts to get to them. That means players start finding the most efficient path to get an item making for a more rewarding experience. The devs in return keep nerfing those efficient paths and adding even more grindy items. Sometimes it really gets out of hand and you have to grind for the opportunity to grind an item. For example, a frame was released a while back. In order to get him you had to farm a specific faction for a rare item 3 times. Then you had to use those 3 items to make another item that would allow you to fight the boss. once you fought the boss you had a small chance for it to drop the part you needed.  - Another problem with this is it leads to power creep. In order for devs to keep players interested they have to release frequent updates. In order for the content to maintain appeal it also has to be better than the last. This continues until it causes balance issues resulting in OP mechanics and leaves previous content obsolete. The devs then either nerf newer content hard or buff older items causing the last set of released items to become obsolete.  - The rushed nature of the releases means the devs don't have the proper amount of time to test items and really think it through. This results in balance issues and broken mechanics after launch that could have been avoided. It also causes them to release a lot of half baked projects and to use players as guinea pigs.  - The in game money purchase system has become an issue for a problematic scam. Platinum is an in game currency required to purchase slots and in game items that can be obtained with real world money or trading in game. However, if a player purchases platinum and trades it with another player then cancels the buy order on the credit card DE will ban those associated with the trade. That means if you trade for platinum or an item purchased with platinum it can get you banned for 20 years. The chances of this happening to an individual are small but not impossible. This scam is also becoming increasingly popular. In order to avoid this you can trade with only those you trust.  - If you do play this game there are some things I suggest doing to keep it worth playing.  Don't get to attached or to heavily invested in anything. The constant balancing means if you invest a ton of time and resources into something it can become nerfed or made obsolete. This also goes for game mechanics that can suddenly break or become frustrating. This is a social game so play with friends as much as you can. It makes up a large portion of the game play experience.  Don't play too much. Play in bursts so you don't get burned out and there is always something interesting to come back too. While that could be said for many games this especially applies to Warframe. Coordinate with friends so that you can all cover every aspect of the game. That way you can help each other to accomplish everything you can in the game together. ",

The same old bugs persist. Inviting someone to a game can take 4 or 5 tries (using all the various methods to invite someone) before it finally works. Inviting them to trade is also buggy. General animation bugs that have been around for such a long time (liset flying into another liset, wrong tenno coming out of your liset, weird errors when the boss introduction scene comes into play) that you forget they are bugs and start to think of them as normal parts of the game! For example, does anybody even know that during the boss fight with lephantis, all three heads are supposed to pop out of the ground and rip the ground out from under-neath you? NOPE, because it's buggy. They just assume they randomly appeared on another platform... after all it's warframe and crap like that happens. Some people call this game BUGframe, and others call warFARM... heck some even call it BUGFARM. which brings me to my second point.  2nd, the grind and the farm gets a little redunant. The nerfed triton and added a semi-okay core reward system for the t4d/s to compensate, but it just takes too darn long to get enough cores/ neurodes/ plastids/ o-cells/ oxium/ neural sensors/ morphics/ gallium/ mutagen mass/ so many other parts i don't feel like naming them. I'm not saying they should make it TOO easy to farm... just a LITTLE easier. Only a smidgeon.  3rd, it offends me that so many games (Bethesda is a perfect example, and so is WARFRAME) come out with beautiful graphics and a fun play style and NEVER fix the bugs. Worse for WARFRAME, their attempt to make us forget is to constantly make new shiny frames and weapons to keep all of us distracted. Well it's not working. We aren't distracted. The only reason why we keep playing is because we love the game and are loyal to it, and we hope that some day ya'll will get the picture and spend more time resolving bug issues/ balance issues, and LESS time making new warframes and weapons.  Honestly, this is a good game. I love this game. It has the potential to be a GREAT game. The DE's just need to spend less time coming out with new crap, and more time fixing the broken old stuff.

The gameplay is great and I hardly see any bugs or glitches. Updates are constantly being pumped into the game to make it more enjoyable for us. Overall, I had a blast playing the game.   When playing the game, don't question why buying platinum based items are so expensive, as it being a F2P game, the company has to find a way to make money. Hence, over-priced 'PRIME ACCESS'.

Its very good at evening out most of the weapon and frame choices but in end game I hear that goes away. I have played this game for three days and I am hooked. Mass Effect 3 multi mixed with mirror's edge is the best way I can describe this game. It is incredibly gratifying to just run slide and shoot your way through nearly endless masses of enemies. Add in the incredible versatility of modding and weapon choice makes your frame less important to early game. If I was to start again from the beginning I would suggest either Volt or Excalibur over Mag. Mag has some useful abilities and is almost exactly the same as playing adept in ME3. See you in game.",

Waste it on looks instead of slots. Ask again, oh now you get it. Off to go score that shiney you saw.... Live Die Repeat so hard! 'Help please,' you cry. Finally a savior comes along.... they have LOTS of shineys and you're so jelly. They help you crawl your way through the basics, you cling to them like a lost puppy. Eventually you start grinding out on your own, two weeks later you have that shiney.  Realise that the shiney isn't so good.... start looking for a new shiney New shiney is so hard to farm so you start begging people to sell you mods for pennies and you grind for them any way. 'Cool I can kill stuff now...' but then you get cocky and go on a planet far too tough for you yet. You grind and grind some more til you have what it takes to farm for Tower 1 missions in the Void. But you're only hanging on by a thread in the Void, you're a good decoy but want to be a Tenno.  You go and buy yourself another visual to make yourself feel better.  On your down time you go chat and Loki master race is a resounding chant. Stalker hunts you and you shiver in fear, suddenly he spawns and disappears. You turn around just in time to watch him assasinate you.... that makes you feel like a noob all over again. Finnally you reach mastery rank 8 where all of the good weapons to help you farm are unlocked.  You're asking habitually which rifle is best.... you don't get a straight answer but you're pretty sure it's Boltor or Soma. Farm grind farm grind farm grind 'OH Stalker has a dread?' The hunt for stalker is on but you give up since he won't drop that ONE ITEM you really want. You then get your first taste of Prime there is no turning back now. Hours and hours you spend begging RNG to give you the next thing your heart desires while trading the fodder away. First pro-build 'I am a Tenno' you say. You main that one gun/frame until... you guessed it the next one comes along. 'I want to make it even better!'  So you inquire about Primed Mods but you're all out of plat but you look dank now so you've got that going for ya. Finally you're able to easily farm for what you set your eyes on, the search is more tiresome than challenging. One by one those items come to you and there is no satisfaction like having the RNG Gods answer your prayers. Til one day you hear the cry of another asking for help.  They cling to you like a lost puppy..............}  So much love/hate! Yes it's hard at the start and it is a grindy game but the shiney is too bright to resist and the satisfaction of getting that item FINALLY is too fulfilling.

The number of interesting weapons in the game also makes this experimenting seemingly endless. This one feature is the only positive aspect of the whole game I can come up with.  Lately (end of 2015) the development direction has accelerated down a path of greed. They have been implementing new research and material gathering methods that are atrocious. It is pretty obvious to the whole community that the game developers are just trying to coerce us into buying everything instead of playing for it by making the gameplay even less appealing than it was already.

            "review_text": "DO NOT PLAY! Wasted WAY more than 9 hours and cannot recommend. I will not go into a bullet list review as it isn't worth the effort. I will instead bring up some 'memorable' issues and what's currently wrong with the game. I don't know where it all started, possibly with their constant 'its in beta!' excuse or the day they made the UI into a resource hog for 'immersion'. In a third person game! Ha! The game is a perpetual grind and the fanboys will defend it like you're insulting their mom. The RNG has been diluted beyond belief along with some items (Oberon parts) mixed into an already diluted item pool. Aside from this the Movement System 2.0 has made movement during combat and stealth clunky in the aspect that you can no longer fluidly 'fly through the battlefield like fire' and instead have a haphazard and dull movement system. 'Coptering' was said to be a problem but really was only a show of minor 'skill' (it was just a fun thing really), not to mention they never really solved it and you can still progress faster. The speed was just nerfed a little (use dual Zoren). Looking past coptering you would have to run and predict your jump, or perhaps take out an enemy too. Maybe you want to continue with a crouch/kick combo or let go of your direction and do a downward attack. Good luck with the last one. Speaking of attack, lets talk about gun attacks when jumping. Now its got a slowdown feature reminiscent of a John Wu film. If you're attacking during a jump, because y'know, you need help with that, it'll slow down so you can take your time to aim. Why not have your frame automatically regenerate health constantly if you're hurt? Maybe hide behind a chest high wall because you're a idiot. You even aim at where to dash jump. This is ridiculous and only serves to make the player more self entitled to being good at the game. I'm not trying to be an elitist, but I see this with so many games (hey Blizzard!). Lets not even get started on the draconian report system. Your allies extracted after telling you'd they stay just to f with you, fun right? You get to stick with one frame at the beginning, no test runs, and MUST stick with that frame. If there is another you'd like then good luck getting to the planet for it, they screwed up the map LONG ago and changed the progression with it. Have fun! They keep dumbing it down and anyone who calls out the mistake is told that they are antiprogress or that its not going to change because of a few people 'qq ing'. Well it can be ran into the ground if a lot of the playerbase leaves due to these and many other issues. Another issue, look at their Prime Access and compare that to MechWarrior Online's business practices. I'm sure this game will go farther though as it seems to appeal to a now broader and duller demographic. To those of you who don't even spend money on it but still refer it, you're cancer. You're not helping and only increase the chance of DE having more cash. I'm tempted to leave this game run on idle just as an f you to their servers. If you want your ego stroked while you endlessly grind and like to say, 'I still have fun. Its still awesome and I feel like a badass. =3 ' then I hope you know how to swim or brought your floaties because 'denile' is a pretty long river.   side note: I will play further to see how bad new player progression is as it was stated in a few other reviews. So far with my 9.6 hours as of writing this it feels VERY stunted. I may just make a more in depth and well written review after that.  Edit: Its crap, don't touch it. BTW, they never fixed helicoptering and degrade their own community on stream.",

It is not pay to win (pay to speed up and for cosmetics) every non-cosmetic item can be obtained through gameplay, some items come a little slow, but it has never been too slow.  After hundreds of hours, I still have a lot of fun playing and interacting with the community and always ended up coming back to this game. The devs seem to really care about the game they've been making. Sometimes they get a little overzealous and don't finish things, but it almost always works out to be positive. They seem really fun to be around, and it makes the game more enjoyable for me.

It's among the few games with an actual fair trade beween RNG and reward (and no, you getting tired because you didn't even cared to learn the basics before screaming 'paywall' and running away doesn't make this statement any less truthful), the amount of things you can't get with other than money aren't significant at all aside from the Founder pack, which is exactly that: an incentive to people who practically gave money away to get some perks in-game when game's was in a REALLY early state of development.   Players with some brains can get platinum (the in-game significant currency that you regularly buy for real money; eg; LoL's RPs) by farming different things.  Of course, the game is not perfect and devs seem to focus more on stopping easy ways to farm and level up weapons and warframes than actually 'tweaking' stuff for the good. Up to date, Mesa's Shooting Galery stills the weakest buff ability, and Peacemaker stills draining ridiculous amounts of energy for the little it does because it's consumpting cap is way too high so making it a duration + efficiency affected is barely significative.  Saryn got an awesome mechanics rework that made her interesting to play with, but is still being an energy expensive Warframe and I can't believe their programmers greenlighted the stupidly unneficient way Spore work because it becomes an awesome resource hog and it hurts more your hardware than your enemies, regardless of what their youtube PR machine unanimously stated since the early ours after the rework (at least it's decen't now, it used to be terrible when they released the first instance of the rework), Toxic Lash is rarely used and I still don't know anyone saying it is good aside from people who uses full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ melee builds focusing solely on it.  Mag's Greedy Pull got an underserved nerf, it was like shooting someone with a shotgun in the face for calling you names. making it a personal utility would be enough, making it a requirement for stuff to be on line of sight AND not bypass walls reduced its usefulness like 1:100.  There is a story for every 'farming friendly' Warframe out there that got nerfed. Digital Extremes do great things when they want (Raids, Spy 2.0, Rescue 2.0, Natha, Second Dream, Orokin moon, Saryn's new mechanics and synergy, sorties) but some other times they also do borderline stupid things that feel arbitrary at best (Mesas' and Saryn current energy consumption, Archwings are an uninteresting module whose resources spent on could have been invested on the actual game -what's next; Tenno Kart?-, some AoE from enemies just insta-kill u on higher levels, combos are more spectacular than useful -this is not a melee focused game, you can't even rely on it on higher levels-, their UI design is 80% focused on aesthetics and 20% on function, and more... ).  I haven't talked about graphics because it is pretty obvious that the game is way ahead of most (if not all) F2P currently in the market. Sound isn't spectacular aside from a few exceptions mostly quest-related things, but it accomplishes what it's meant for.  I think this game is a solid 7/10, it isn't just decent, it is good, at moments very good such moments are more and more frequent since I started playing, although, consistency isn't one its qualities. They could easily sell this game for $50 bucks if they reduced the grind by reducing the grind and adding more story, so, I don't think trying it (or getting back into it) will hurt you.",

The experience is frustratingly unguided; even the main story quests eventually force you to Google where to find certain mats that may or may not be (most likely, not) represented in the low-level daily quest.   Even if the game was more accessible, the means to grind in the game aren't terribly fun or varied until you get to later in the game (that's what people tell me; I didn't play on to that point). The best way to grind for necessary-to-advance Rubedo was to do 'protect-the-healthbar-in-the-center' missions over and over again with different map set-ups. They didn't design everpresent, introductory grinding missions around this mainline story quest. HOW?  The game completely lacks basic tutorials, too: I had to learn the ins and outs of fusing mods, mods being a means just as important to customization as Warframes and weapons, from a YouTube video. It's also unclear how different elemental type simpact different enemy types without looking it up outside of the game, etc.  People who invest in the game often really love it, but I wanted to put my experience down here: if you want to just try it for a bit and see how you like it before dedicating, you might not get a very good experience.",

This game is only fun once you've aquired a weapon and character that you like, and you have access to all the higher level missions, but sometimes even then it can start getting repetitive. For example, I usually quit playing for long periods of time sometimes because of how boring some of the missions can be. I play for a month but then stop playing for 3 and then come back to it because I know that they added new content by then.  If you're not scared off by the fact that it takes an investment of time for the game to be fun, then listen carefully. The game has a lot of flaws in terms of gaining rewards. It's a free to play game where you can either farm the equipment you need, or you could just simply buy it.

Trading: I like trading and getting that plat, don't get me wrong, I hate the trading chat, that's why I use a site called warframe.market. Grind: Now some people see grind as a bad thing. But in Warframe's case grind is good because if you like the game then it's enjoyable to grind. Different mission types. Customization AKA Fashionframe. Uranus (If you know what I mean). Warframe (class) variety: at the moment there's 28 different warframes. Melee combat: from slashing and dashing with swords to ragdolling enemies all over the map with a hammer Parkour: after all it's a ninja game :D Modding: collect mods, upgrade them, make your own build (or multiple builds) for each warframe! Having my own spaceship: hanging out in my own ship or being stuck in menus? I'll take the ship please. Kubrows: who doesn't like weird... dog... pet... things? Carrier: this guy picks up (or vacuum's) things for you! Rebecca... I mean Lotus. Ragdoll: enemies flying all over the place. What else should I say? The Second Dream: dat story tho! Getting loot: I like my loot. Crafting: now put that loot to use. Community: wow I've met so many friendly people in warframe (except from that one russian guy that yels at you via voice chat). Ordis.  What I don't like:  Chat system: seriously, you have to look for group in the LFG chat or if you want to sell something you have to spam in the cancerous trade chat. Thank god for the 3rd party sites. Waiting for things to finish crafting: it's like you're an 8 year old and your mom buys you a toy you always wanted. And then what does she do with that toy? She puts it right in front of your face and says that you will only be able to play with it in 3 days. Weird bugs (or whatever) that makes you disconnect in the middle of a mission: that doesn't happen that often but it does happen. Ordis.",

I loved it and still play to this day. However, ever since the release of Fallout 4, I have been playing that till today too. Heres where it gets interesting. I decided to take a break from rpgs and look for a 'fresh' approach. I saw that Warframe was free to play and so I tried it out. That was 3 months ago. I already have 112 hours on record but, the deepness and complexity of this game is extremely refreshing. Sure, the farming aspect of this game can get repetitive but like anything in life, working hard towards a goal is worth the while. The gameplay is fun, fast paced, intense, and after a while can get strategic. Graphics wise, its gorgeous with its heavy light system and heck, I would dare say its on par with current gen graphics. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely! I know this game can look intimidating but the community of gamers I have encountered help each other out and dont worry, I ll be out there too!   JON P.",

            "review_text": "It has the potential to be great. The combat, with the exception of boss fights, is really good.  The grind is ridiculous. To craft a warframe or weapon, you have to run missions for blueprints and parts. The game does not explain which missions to run. The only way to know is to ask another player or look it up on the wiki. You are not guaranteed to get the part you need and will likely have to run the mission 20-30 times, maybe more. 'Prime' weapon parts come from special missions that require keys which are used up when you finish the mission. The keys must be farmed and have the same RNG issues. You have to grind so you can grind.  The bosses have long phases where they are invincible and there is no way to know how to make them vulnerable without, again, asking another player or looking it up on the wiki. The game does not explain anything.  New players start with 2 warframe slots and a few weapon slots. These will be filled quickly, forcing you to buy premium currency to unlock more slots. Weapons and warframes need to be 'supercharged' with items that cost around $1.20 to be effective at higher levels. You can get a few for free every now and then but they are extremely rare. You need one for each weapon and warframe you plan to use. Having a large arsenal will require a ton of waiting for special time limited missions (as in they appear randomly and are only available for maybe an hour, so you have to be watching it constantly) that give you the item, or a lot of money spent in the cash shop.  The developers discourage experimenting with different loadouts and builds. They have decided a few weapons and warframes will be the endgame meta and if they notice it is possible for anything else to compete with those, they get nerfed to the point of uselessness. If you 'supercharged' it, you wasted your money, time, and/or resources. If it makes the grind somewhat bearable, it will definitely be nerfed ASAP.  If you don't look at it as a free to play game, and instead spend about $20 or so to unlock slots and only use the 'correct' gear, it's not so bad.  I've been playing since closed beta.

Even without spending a penny you can get pretty far, albeit at a very slow rate. The missions star to feel very repetitive at this point (70-ish hours), but still much more content that destiny.

There are 4 diffrent ways u can get gear in games. 1- u simply get it, eveyone has the same experience and strays no where from the liniar path to get the item so everyones gaming experence it the same.  2- u find it. Its a secrect, something no one (unless looking up info about the game from someone who has played it) could know was there, only your random choices led u you to find it when other may have passed it by.  3- you earn it. you build, craft, get it as a reward for doing the level in a special way, whatever it is u know 'i must do this to earn this' so everyone can pick what they want to obtain.  4- you choose it. you are giving a choice. a few more paths open but everyone has the same options   Of these 4 how yould you like to obtain your items?  If you didnt have to grind (play the game) for hours to get that item would it be nearly as cool? if u could just click a button and have the best gear would you really want to? whats the point then? well funny thing is you can, for money. thats the best part about this game is that there is a trading platform. so if u grind out to get that super rare part u can then trade it for real in game money and buy something otherwhys unobtainable unless u spent actual cash. so every item in the game is possible to get for free.  Yes this game is repetitive but for a reason, with how much content and the stunning graphics u cant expect some rich story line thats just not what MMO's are about, there are missions and what not but this isnt a game u beat. This is a game u check up on every day play for a lil, mabe get sucked in for 7 strait hours then wait for the daily reset and do it again the next day.  It really depends on you i didnt like this game at first but now i cant help but log in every day, the movement system is just amazingly fun graphics and sounds are great and ITS FREE you have nothing to lose trying this game.   The one bad thing about this game is that being free it has to make money some how off your average joe. Their solution : time wall. For those that dont know a time wall is its common in apps (clash of clans) it simply mean u have to wait for stuff. After uve been out farming for that glorious new warframe and u start building it ur hit with it.... 3 day wait... this can be rushed instantly with equivilant of about 4 in game dollars but its really not that bad waiting once u find out how the game works and have much more to do.  all in all i say great game 9/10 not 10 because there could be more enemy types. but its FREE try it.

First started in the beta and was a founder because I thought the game had potentiel that I wanted to support, but was not without it's glaring flaws and disconnecting mechanics. Now after about a year and a half I will say that my money and faith was well placed. DE has done an astounding job of making this game fun, unique, and easy to get into. For people who looked at this game in its early stages, give it another try. This is not the same game I played in 2014, and for the better. I've come back very recently and started spending a lot of time again in the game now that there's about 400% more content than what I began with. DE's come a long way since the begnings of this game, and I hope it continues to grow and become better.  Pros: Quality graphics (really beautiful on max settings) Really interesting gameplay Best experienced with friends or clans you get to know well hundreds of options Really well optimized (And I have a basic laptop i've tried playing on, still runs at 60FPS) A surprisingly good community for the most part Incredibly responsive dev team regular content updates and fixes Lord Red Text Life Sink  Cons: Soloing can be a bit boring. End game challenges are a bit slim (proper builds will destroy almost everything the game has to offer) Lots of wiki visits for information (no seriously, Wiki is your friend) Some content is a bit short handed or lacking (archwings mission tweaks still needed, and more raids) Perhaps a little too much RNG for some people's tastes Life sink",

Remember nothing is OP if everything is OP (Obviously Excal and Valkyr would need some restriction on their 4th abilitys in PVP Like maybe Excal just gets a sword that one hits whilst he has energy and Valkyr gets a time in invincibility but is has a cooldown (all moves should have some cool down to make it fair so you dont get perma frozen by frosty boy)... I just think PVP on this game was such a huge let down and I never thought I'd find myself saying this but it almost needs to be more like CoD or BF... They could also add in a ban system like most ofther MMO/MOBAs so every game you could ban out warframes that you find annoying like Loki, Ivara, Valkyr, Excal, Frost etc   But PVP aside PVE and farming is fun until it gets boring ahaha... (again being able to use what ever you want in PVP would add huge incentive to farming PVE and trading with the community) ",

No exclusives for people that pay a bunch of money. If you like a certain weapon and think it looks cool then you can just play the game to get it. Even if someone on your team has payed 1 million dollars it wouldnt be affecting you in a bad way. They would be helping you since they are on your team. The only downside to this is that it is very grind heavy... And I mean VERY grind heavy to the point where you will spend days trying to get a certain item... BUT this doesnt matter if: 1. You like grinding 2. You can find other things to do while grinding (leveling up warframes, weapons, sentinels, etc.)  3. You can put on some music that you like (because trust me, if you are grinding and you put on some music you are going to have a blast, you wont even notice the fact that you are grinding)  To add on to the fact that this game is heavily free to play, I sold on item on the game for a total of approximately 50 dollars. And I got that item by JUST playing the game. As easy as that. Its amazing. Also, this game is essentialy never ending! Meaning you can play however long you want and there will STILL be more stuff to unlock.  Pros: -Not pay to win at all -So much content -Always new things -Creators are always hard at work creating new content and fixing bugs  Cons: -Very grind heavy -Can get sort of stale at times  While the game still has a lot of bugs, DE (the production team) is working extremely hard all the time to fix bugs. Not only that but they are constantly releasing new content to add to the already stacked game. This is an amazing game and I definitely recommend it. Since it is free there is no reason to not try it.  I give this game a  FIVE OUT OF FRICKIN FIVE",

            "review_text": "At the time of writing this review it is my most played game with 375+ hours. That should give you some indication as to my opinion of this game...  The game has fast gameplay, nice graphics and some of the story is incredible. The game has a lot to offer people, even if they have played for years, as new content is constantly being added. The community is (generally) nice which helps as the game emphasises heavily on team work to do a lot of the game. There is a nice variety of weapons that can suit your play style however, a lot of them are underpowered and are not viably for use on harder missions. This does mean that the player has to keep upgrading their weapons and mods, use to improve certain aspects of the weapon, which gives them something to work towards. There are many different 'warframes', characters that the player can use, that all have advantages and disadvantages which helps keep the game interesting and makes people think about team compositions.  This all being said, there are a few things that I dislike about the overall experience. I actually hate the new navigation system that got added a few patches ago and considering I have to use it to get to every mission it does take away from the overall fun (this is probably me but I felt I should add it). Grinding for materials can become tedious and boring but is required for the improvement of your weapons and warframes. After 375+ hours the gameplay has begun to become stale and repetitive, although I know people with over 1000 hours and still enjoy it. If you wish to fully experience the game you need to buy the ingame currency, which allows for the purchasing of cosmetics, weapons and warframes (all of which are horribly overpriced). There are also 'prime warframes' which are better versions of other frames which game be obtained through void missions but not purchased through the ingame store. This leaves two options: farm it or buy it from another player in the trade tab. As a new player the trade section is confusing and takes time to learn but sadly the game doesn't explain how to properly use it (or at all from my memory).  I would recommend the game as it is enjoyable and has fun combat but like most games it has its flaws. But it is free which is nice.  7.5/10",

There is some time-gating for the crafting, which is rather annoying at the start since you don't have a lot of gear to play with in the meantime. There is a general lack of guidance in-game, so I strongly recommend finding some guides elsewhere (most notable example I've seen: Tenno that don't know they can glide... until the game requires them to - and thus get stuck, and have to find a guide -, which is pretty far in). The parkour system in this game is fun, but I frequently find myself unsure of where I am supposed to go (be it using the mini-map or in the parkour challenges). There's a free flight mode. Seems great on paper, but it still needs work. Also, maybe it's 6DOF (I've never managed to control the roll though), but they don't support 6DOF devices.",

The main focus of the game is about min/maxing and collecting loot to improve said min/maxing, so if you don't enjoy that style then this isn't for you. Best played with others enthused about Warframe  You will feel like a god when you play this game, spinning around murdering anything even remotely hostile with lightning guns or rocket launchers or swords simultaneously electrify and blow up people. Or hell, just punching a guy into orbit is a viable method of murder that this game provides. I found it a great game to play while socializing with your friends; Get a bunch of people together in a teamspeak and play while talking about whatever. At the highest level of the game (read several hundred hours in) most missions can be done with casual ease and discussing different builds and combinations of warframes can keep conversations going for hours.  The biggest downside is that Warframe is undoubtably a grind and time sink. You must gather the credits to purchase the blueprint for a weapon which then has specific material requirements, some exceedingly rare, which must be ground for. once completed then you must wait 12 hours to even get the weapon and even then it will need to be leveled up to become useful. EVEN THEN you still need to upgrade it in two different ways to get the absolute most out of it. total time spent depends on the weapon in question but it can take anywhere from a week to a month to get a weapon from unowned to pinnacle of achievement that weapon can reach. and this is assuming you have all the required mods to reach that pinnacle, which themselves can take a long time to acquire.  However with all that said it is still one of the most addicting games I have ever played. 8/10",

Key grind/farming was bad enough before as well as resource/part/bp/mod farming. but now you're gonna be delighted by how many things you can farm now void tears, stupid flowers and one off the worst hours spent to do one stupid passageway task... don't even get me started on that it's ridiculous how some tasks are dificult some are easy like lifting your finger and others are just abnoxiously annoying increasing the wait time for anything and now you have to do them to actualy unlock the missions... yeah the mission you were able to buy before in the shop no problem now you have to wait for them... hours days grind for them.... why even add the war within when you're gonna make me grind for it how to get it: first 10 sentients killed, 3 special drift mods acquired, and a weapon build for a rank 5 or above... and any of those tasks do not work backwards! i played this game for a long time endured the DEVs being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and eating up m,ore and more of my time with their great farmville clone with ninjas breaking the game time after time and leaving holes in it never even trying to repair more important things or even try to balance actual gameplay... no now the game is officialy broken tons of vets left it after this update and i will do as well since this is the smart decision tons of money and actual time spent on this only to be punished.... for playing before the update... if DEVs think that i will go through each of those stupid passageways to be again able to do missions they're wrong i'm tired of replaying and grinding Thanks DEVs for ruining the game completly next time thing again before even touching a PC ok?",

            "review_text": "Okay I downloaded this game, realized I need to register on a website and then shelved it for about 3 months (so tired of having to pre-reg). However once I got over my laziness and signed up for WF, I found this game to be amazingly fun/additive.  4/5 for game play. Initnally the game is kind of overwhelming, lot of mods and different way to configure your Tenno. However once you start peeling back the game layers you realize there is so much to do. DE found a way to merge simple with complex. All the while encouraging you to try every aspect of the game.  4.5/5 for graphics, style, ambiance. I rarely use the word 'cool' anymore to describe things but this game is actually pretty umm ... cool. The look and feel of WF aesthetic is consistent for the world. When you first see a stalker or are invaded by an enemy, it looks powerful, intimidating. The way opponents a game should look. It enough to draw everyone's attention and prepare to survive.  Only draw backs are some Tenno frames go HAM with the graphics their abilities output. When you have 4 of those frames in 1 mission all spamming abilities things do get chaotic. Also, mission maps tend to repeat a little bit to frequently for my taste. However the variation of the enemies/modes slightly makes up for it.  5/5 Sound. The voice overs and ambient sounds are superb! The enemies sound intimating. The world feels immersive.   4/5 Story/lore. I really love the lore of this game. It's post-post-post-post apocalyptic type setting. Filled with plot twists and requires a little outside delving to discover it all.  They streamline the plot through a few quests to bring you in the world. However, I do believe they could offer a bit more lore this way. The story quest are too few imho and the game would benefit from of them.  Now as I type this they have just released: The War Within. DE seem to remain frequent on updating the story and lore so this could be a good thing.  Community. For the most part the community seems good. Everyone is super excited about the game and most people are quick to offer explanation or help when asked. I can't really tell the size of the community because of the way the game is set up. However it seems there are a ton of people a endgame/near end game. And fewer people who are working their way up.   The Devs are very interactive with the community. Often doing a little RP in chat. The ingame HYPE for The War Within on release was wild and energetic. I really like that they thematically hype their own game.   PvP pvp is okay. The population for pvp is low (at certian times). The balance is questionable. My suggestion to you would be to clear most of the pve before you attempt pvp. Learn how to use your frame, how to move and dash around like a ninja.   Basic New Tips. It's not p2w imo. It's just pay to get things a bit faster.  If you are serious about the game and actually want to progress faster. Do a little research on youtube/wiki before you start. Clearing planets sometimes requires certain tasks be met. So look for the junction requirements asap and complete the tasks as you go along.  Trying every weapon and every frame is the best way to level.  Join a Clan  Not all missions need to be completed with other players. If you have a hard time finding others just try to solo it.  Use your beginning plat wisely. Also once you find a weapon/frame you like, dont be afraid to  upgrade it early. Yes, better frames will come along but the wait could be a while. It's not super fun to struggle till then (unless you like that challenge).  Keep an eye out for promo codes.  And finally repect CLEM! &lt;3",

            "review_text": "As a preface; I exclusively play Warframe through their own launcher and not the steam one, so don't take the hours listed here seriously. As of writing this review I have at least 900 hours in the game.  Warframe may market itself as a game about ninjas, but that isn't really a very good description of it.  Warframe is a player vs enemy randomized dungeon crawler / third person shooter / Hero shooter / grind for progession free to play MMO-like centered around the idea of obtaining and mastering loot and weapons.   The gameplay itself consists of moving around the map quickly through use of your warframe's high air mobility while you shoot enemies while performing an objective on the map. Sometimes this objective IS to shoot enemies. Every mission in the game basically boils down to this. But missions happen in such short spurts and have such a jump in/jump out quality to them that they manage to be addictive and entertaining, despite not being all that varied.  This game is free to play, which means there are microtransactions. Most of these microtransactions are extremely fair, you can get around almost all of them by grinding in the game (Not factoring in trading through the in game economy). The grind is, obviously, not the quickest thing in the universe. It is however much quicker than most other Free to Play games that I have experienced.  There is a lot of grinding in this game, if you enjoy games like Monster Hunter you'll probably have fun here. If you hate the idea of grinding, this game might not be for you. I do find that the grinding doesn't often feel bad in Warframe since Warframe's goal IS getting that next item or maxing that next mod. Unlike other games, progress isn't often locked behind getting that item. Instead, getting that next item IS the progress, and if you arn't happy with your progress towards that weapon you can swap your focus to getting a different one since there are so many of them. This tapers off a little bit once you hit the end of the game as I have, where the things being grinded for (Riven mods and Primed Items almost exclusively) often are based entirely on RNG, so you lose the feeling of every mission you do serving as some form of progress. I do feel that's fair after accumulating the number of hours that I have, however.  The dev team is pretty involved with their community. Even when they don't listen to popular feedback they usually do address the fact that the feedback WAS present and read. Which is more than most devs these days, who seem almost scared to be even slightly open with the community.  The game is constantly updated, and not in the way you expect from most f2ps where it's like 'every six months or so they add a pay to play episode that lasts 10 minutes and has unbalanced drops.' Warframes quests are always free, and while they've slowed down a bit recently, manage to come out fairly frequently. New weapons are added to the game at a pretty fast pace. There's usually at least one update per week, though the update doesn't always contain new additions.  The game isn't without issues, though. First of which is balance. The game is PVE so balance isn't AS high a requirement as it would be in PVP games, but the lack of balance is still there. Most weapons in the game can perform throughout the entire star chart, but theres very noticiable performance gaps that grow larger and more noticiable the longer you play.  Inventory Slots. Earlier I said that most of the microtransactions are super fair and only save you time. There is one exception to this. You start the game with a handful of slots for weapons and warframes. Each built weapon or warframe requires a slot. Since the game is all about gaining new warframes and weapons the starting ammount of slots, while they will not prevent you from playing as long and to as hard of difficulties as you want, will definitely hinder your enjoyment as you're forced to ditch your weapons pretty regularly. Slots arn't that expensive, and though I think they could give new players one or two slots more, they're still pretty fair considering. You can play with just the starter slots but slots are definitely the area you will feel you're forced to drop money on the most during your time with this game.  Bugs. The game is pretty buggy. Rarely unplayably so, but they're still not exactly rare. DE doesn't really seem to have any kind of large internal testing team, so whenever any new quests or new modes launch, you can expect to encounter a lot of bugs with them during the first two days of their implementation before DE manages to smooth them out some.  The game doesn't explain itself well. A lot of things you will need to look up on the wiki or ask other players about.  I would recommend Warframe if you're looking to just jump into a quick game at your leisure on occasion and don't neccesarely want something that costs much or is in depth. I would also recommend it if you don't mind playing a game with no real goal other than having fun while grinding out whatever looks cool or is new. I wouldn't say that Warframe is for everybody, but I do think the majority of gamers can probably enjoy it for what it is.",

Cons: - RNG - meh skins for weapons - u can get burns cuz of the grinding; - i feel that they sometimes neglet this great parkour system; - bad AI, like really really bad (this includs bosses) - this year many many spongebullet/invulnerable enemies ( to reduce the 1 shot killing enemies but used in a bad uninspired way) - RNG - repetetive after a while: few maps; even if u have like 100 missions only a few are usefull/worthy - sorties: repetetive, boring and bad rewards, after TWW comes with extra burns. Can't talk about raids, i was never interested. - now its worthless to push yourself in endless missions cuz reward nerfs; - lately very toxic community; - bad pvp; - new bad riven mods that comes with even more RNG: new reward from sorties that can be used on a random weapon, with a random mr req and random stats ( if you're bad luck brian u could get a riven mod for a sentinel weapon with 100%/200% on useless stats); - vaulting prime weapons/frames   Huge con: constant nerfs to resouce/xp farming; i understand that it isnt normal to max everything in a couple of months but honestly even if you are a new player u can feel the burns:  - farm a tremendious amount of rare resources to make weapons/frames( oh you managed to get a decent amount cuz u got somehow a (stacked) 4x / 8x booster? let's introduce a new ultra rare resource req for new weaps/frames - after u leveled a weapon/frame and want to improve it you have to relevel that weapon/frame, ah and btw xp farming was rnerfed this year about 2 times ( xp range, stealth killiling)  Why do i still recommend this game with so many cons?

            "review_text": "Let me write a bit of a comprehensive review of this game. Also, my play time is only slightly deceptive simply because some of my friends have used my rig to check in and play on Warframe.  I have 1,000 hours by myself on this game. I have been playing since the day before Update 10. Let me tell you, the changes I have seen.  I am rather unsure as to where to begin with this review, but here goes.    Pros   The quests are rather well done and do let you in on some of the lore in the game itself. As much as the quests can be slightly grindy themselves, they are still worth doing.  Customization of weapons, warframes, colors and accessories never ends. Millions of colors to choose from, tons of attachments to make yourself look more pretty. Please for the love of whatever god you believe in, do NOT be that guy in the game who has no stance and basic colors on all of your crap. You look like a chump.  Companion Mechanics aren't so bad, you can have Dog [Kubrow] Cat [Kavat] or a sentinel. They all give benefits, bonuses, and can fight alongside you. (Insert inert vacuum update appreciation here.)  There are plenty of alerts, challenges, invasions, syndicate missions and relic runs that you can do to get better mods, rewards, weapons, and customizations.   Syndicates and their rewards are great and extremely useful.  The player ships was a great addition to the game and helped organize the arsenal, mods, foundry, relics, etc, in a much cleaner fashion.  The enemies come in all shapes and sizes and difficulties, and trust me-I might be mastery level 19 but I still get the crap beat out of me in some missions. The challenge is always there and that's a great thing.  Recruiting chat is useful-USE IT.  Clan system  It's great, although it is hard to start one and run it efficiently, I started one with the help of a few and it grew to over 250 at one point. The more people to help contribute to research and builds, the better. Plus, there are clan based weapons and warframes that only come from clan research so joining one is beneficial to you.  The Mastery Rank up missions.  They start easy but holy crap, you play long enough, the devs are gonna make sure you're good at what you do. Don't even get me started on the MR19 test. It was fun, but a true challenge.   The tilesets of missions have changed over time and many of them are quite pretty.   The factions all have their units, and even they change over time. I remember when there weren't mutalist moas...those were the days.   The bosses are always fun to go and fight, just remember to let someone else get the kill shot. You know what I'm talking about.  Scanning and getting things put into your codex is actually fun, you can go to easy missions by yourself and just relax and scan, and get out.  The Simalcrum is a wonderful addition as well, allowing you to test your weapons and frames on multiple enemies at different levels to see how much damage you can do. Or, to test whether or not a certain frame build is good.  Passive abilities being added to warframes was another great addition to the game, and helps give you a little bit of an edge sometimes if things go south.   The Void Trader was an awesome addition, as well as primed mods. This also gave you some pretty weapons too, at the expense of your credits and ducats. Which unfortunately you have to sell prime parts for but hey, everyone has extra bronco prime parts.   The relays are an extremely useful place, as well as a cool place to go see and talk to other players (occasionally even the server will bestow it's great wisdom upon us).   ENDO.  This was a massive change especially to those of us with over a few thousand fusion cores. Okay, so endo is what you use to power up your mods that you put on frames, weapons, companions, and the like. Used to be that you had fusion cores to do so, and there was a fusion core market. With the change to endo, the market was all but vaporized. As extremely unfortuante as this was-the endo is still a nice change, to me at least. I still sorta miss my cores though...  The Trading system is much better than it used to be, I recall when it first came into the game.  NO. YOU CANNOT TRADE BASIC WEAPONS/WARFRAMES/BLUEPRINTS OR MATERIALS. Carry on.  Dark Sectors Now I know that the invasions are off for now, but let me remind you that these missions give LOTS of credits and TONS of materials and XP, so please, if you need XP, go for one of these. They all have their benefits.   I believe that's as many pros as I have for now, and if I think of any more, I will add them. Now here's what we all need to talk about.   CONS  ARCHWING.  This is quite literally, to me, the MOST HATED mode in this game. I will say that when it came around, it was pretty cool. I would sometimes run an archwing mission because, hey, space ninjas...IN SPACE. Am I right?  But here is where it went to literal ♥♥♥♥ to me. The second it was shoved down our throats.  When the relays came to be, there was one orbiting every planet. Then this boss character by the name of VAY HEK decided it was time to 'destroy' them. Which forced many of us to begrudgingly get out our half-leveled archwings, level them up, mod them, and go spend our time protecting these relays. Mind you, there are only three left at this point. Four if you count Maroo's Bazaar. These relays orbit Mercury, Saturn, and Pluto. But the only way to defend these were with our archwings. Yes, we got nice and dandy rewards from it and all, but this game mode is total CRAP. Plus they added in the stupid ♥♥♥ submersible missions on Uranus. There are already so many things wrong with that statement right there. I could spend all day trashing the abortion that archwing is, but I have other things to cover.  The Grind IT SUCKS. But what sucks the most to me are the relic missions. Yeah it makes things a little more organized and changes up the void rewards, but holy crap guys and gals. It is one horrific thing to go through. It made this game more grindy than it was, which I did NOT think was possible. Yes, you have to wait 24 hours for weapons to build and 72 hours for warframes. It's a wait, it's true. It sucks. But the wait is well worth it. (So what I rushed Inaros, leave me alone. I was excited)  PLATNIUM I ONLY put this as a con because well, you pay for it with real money. Oh and trading it, the tax rate on it is INSANE. Plus the discounts you get on it aren't always that great. I've passed up so many 20% offs, it's bordering on crazy.  The Introduction and Starting Out Now this is much more lengthy and grindy than I remember it being. I even played through the beginning and tutorial to see what it was like when it was changed. So, what. Everyone starts on Earth now, rather than Mercury? I guess that's part of improving the game though, showing off your new tileset and such. I understand. I guess the tutorial needed a change at some point. But SERIOUSLY. DAMAGED MODS. It's not all that hard to get INTO the game, but the damaged mods make you feel like a peashooting crapwad. It's embarassing to say the least, and honestly I feel like it's slightly discouraging to any new player. But that's what a new player is being all about, right?  Side note- Maroo's Bazaar. Okay New players and anyone looking for something in particular. Do NOT. Bother those of us there that have set up shop with UNSOLICITED BEGGING. I WILL NOT GIVE YOU MY ONLY BERSERKER MOD. I came to see if anyone was up for trading what I had set up shop for, not what you came there to beg me for. I know the Bazaar leaves you open for unsolicited trades, but that is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. Try trade chat and the warframe markets first, or even your buddies, before you go looking to trade with people who don't want to just hand you their hard earned things.   That's all for now folks, postive review from a 3 year veteran.",

It's free to play ... so just give it a try and see for yourself :-) Don't really wanna mention that here, though the question will come anyway: Is it pay 2 win ? NO. Definitely not. I don't play much PvP in this game but money won't help you improving anything to be better than anyone. For PvE ... sure, you can get your stuff faster, no farming needed ... but where's the point. Most fun in this game are the missions where you farm your equipment. You can easily farm enough to sell/trade to other players to buy whatever you need for ingame currency. I've always had more than i would ever need, though one day i decided to buy a Prime Access Pack anyway, simply because i play this game a lot and felt like the Devs are doing such an awesome job that they deserve my support.

            "review_text": "This is one of the first 'formal esque' critiques I've ever done, so take it easy on me.    PERSONAL OPINION  : Personally I love this game, and have dropped a little sliver of money into it(just to get a little boost ahead), even though I have done so with a twinge of regret afterwards. The game is much easier with money being dropped into it, but is still enjoyable even without dropping any of your hard earned cash on it. The game seems slightly pay to win to me, because you can buy special weapons that you normally wouldn't be able to get with real money, you can buy rare materials that you need to craft certain warframes and weapons, and you can also buy some other misc stuff you wouldn't normally be able to get if you don't drop money on the game. But otherwise, the game is pretty good.    OVERVIEW FROM EXPERIENCE  : From my point of view, the game seems very repetitive and grindy, BUT , It is extremley fun if you have a group of friends to play with. Playing online with random people can be a struggle sometimes, because some people have no idea where they are going, some people die constantly, or simply just go afk at the start. I have to say I am a culprit of this some of the time, but it is extremly annoying if you are trying to rush throuhg a mission online. Solo play can be a little bit of a struggle, as some of the missions are almost uncompletable solo ( mainly the defense missions). So you need to do much more grinding when you are in Solo Play rather then multiplayer. But leveling up your warframes, weapons, and drones is very thrilling and fills you with a sense of delight when you see the 'LEVEL UP' with your weapon under it. Getting to the new planets can be a struggle sometimes if you are underleved for the planets, as the enemies get much more difficult, but the rewards of the missions get much better and newer materials are avaliable on these planets(such Gallium and Orokin Cells). In my experience some of the best weapons in the game to use are the melee weapons. They seem very strong and can take down enemies in seconds, unlike the bows, which seem very underpowered. It still takes 2-3 shots to take down some enemies, even with headshots/crits on the bows. Some of the most enjoyable missions are the stealth missions. It is so much fun to just run around all sneakily and just assassinating all your enemies! Some of the least enjoyable missions are the mobile defense missions. You have to carry around that datamass and run around with only your secondary and melee weapon, which can cause for some tricky if you run into powerful enemies(yikes). It is also a pain defending the control point(in solo at least), as in some missions you're in one sector of the room killing enemies to keep them away from the console, but at the same time some other enemies are destroying your control center, so i really dislike the mobile defense missions.  Now let's end off with the pros and cons.   PROS :  -No bugs(that i have encountered) -Almost no glitches -Good Graphics -Smooth Gameplay -Fast load up times when flying to and from planets. -Good movement options while on the planets(ziplines, Running, rolling, dodging). -Enemies are fair and are fairly challenging to take out. -Materials are pretty easy to come by, as there are deposits everywhere on planets. -Communication with teammates on online play is simple -Matchmaking doesn't take a long time at all -Very interesting warframes with unique abilities -Cool looking weapons  -Intriguing lore -Lots of lore -The game's sounds are balanced(not overly loud or quiet) -Pretty visuals -Nice soundtracks -Good storyline -Not too easy, but not too hard -Updates quite often -Interesting enemy designs -Clans you can join have the capability to have a lot of people, clan communication is easy. -Mastery Rank System is easy to figure out and unlocks many new items -Syndicates give you access to unique items, and can get you items that help greatly with gameplay. -End game is pretty easy. (I probably missed alot, but oh well)   CONS :  -Repetitive Gameplay -too easy for experienced gamers -very tedious when farming/grinding for rare materials -Can buy almost all rare materials with real money -Finding people with your skill level/play time to play with is difficult -Weapons aren't very balnced,  -Some weapon types are very underpowered(bows -Pvp is boring -Buying in-game currency(Platinum) is very relevant and necessary -Platinum can give you gigantic boosts in-game -Very limited storage space to store Mods/Weapons  All in all I love Warframe, even though it has a lot of faults, but i believe the Pros outweigh the Cons.  If you made it this far thanks for taking the time to read my Review (*^w^*) ",

            "review_text": "Warframe is a long running free to play game with premium options to spend real money on.   You'll likely read and hear that Warframe is grind heavy, and indeed it can be, but I've always felt that a grind can be made to feel unimportant so long as the game itself is fun, and the grind does not feel necassary. Warframe is grindy, but it is not a necassary grind.    The actual gameplay, that of third person combat is highly satisfying. The movement feels mostly very fluid and quite easy to manage complex and badass moves that leave you feeling as if you're more than just the common enemies. You're more agile, more skilled, and far more mobile. The weapons range in feel from average shooter, and beyond. Finding weapons that you like and prefer over others, even if slightly weaker, can be very satisfying. Melee weapons are not the best aspect of the game, but they are easy to use and are done far better than most every other shooter game I've ever played. Not the high point, but considering how great most of the guns feel, the melee weapons not being as satisfying is not a gross condemnation of the game by any means.   The movement and guns feel great. The missions themselves are usually fairly short and feature random maps. The maps are not like a lego set with a million different pieces arranged for your running pleasure, rather the map makers have created rooms and hallways that are semi-randomly matched together so that while all of the missions look somewhat similar, the maps themselves are greatly varied. It's a servicable solution to keep burnout at bay for the player. There is much to hide behind and flip about on. The gameplay is further varied by each frame or class that the player can use. Everything from a warframe that can hurl fire and burn everything in sight to a quick cowboy-like frame that blasts enemies with a pair of pistols.   The grind is not severe. It will take a lot of time to attain what you want, but for the most part you don't need any of the truly grindy items. You'll mostly just find yourself setting a goal and grinding for it because you enjoy the gameplay itself, the goal itself is pretty much secondary as you revel in slaughtering hundreds of hapless enemies.    Everything can be attained by not paying any money, though some items may naturally require longer periods of time to acquire without paying real money. The player economy is strong and obtaining the premium currency by trading away valuable items that other players want is not a severe affair, though may require some luck and timing if you're unwilling to negotiate.   Try the game, and if you enjoy the movement and gunplay then you're likely to enjoy sticking around. If the movement and guns, even the starter weapons, don't sound, look, and feel satisfying to you then I'd say that the gameplay will not quite manage to hook you, and so the grind will quickly exhaust you.",

The game is always being updated with new missions, features, fixes, core content, ect. Sometimes I think the game feels fresh and new after some updates. Warframe has come such a long way and I can't wait to see whats next for the game.  The game can be grindy and repetitive but I love the combat and trying new weapons and warframes. Every weapon and frame has a level cap of 30. you can apply mods that you will get from missions and NPCs to improve there stats.  When you build up enough overall XP you can gain a new mastery rank, with each new mastery rank you will need to do a challange to go up in a mastery rank.   Customization seems endless, you can change the look of weapons, warframes, pets, ships, even clan Dojos can be customized to your personal choice. You can make yourself stick out from the crowd. A lot of these customization options will require you to pay some platinum.   There is somthing for everyone in Warframe, you can play the way you want. I personaly like being a tanky Rhino Prime warframe along with the Hek Shotgun and the Scindo axe. I have friends that like being more of a support build or even going in stealth.   Graphicly the Warframe looks amazing and is up to par with some modern AAA games. The game is also very well optimized and runs great on my PC.

After coming back home to a wife who cheated and wanted a divorce, I fell into a deep depression. I thought my life was over and my existence had no purpose. That was, until I found this game.     I thought this game was a joke. A Space Ninja MMO?!? This'll be hilarious. It even had DLC on sale! I invited some close friends over, we needed to kek together at this glorious joke.   We booted up the game and set the graphics quality to 'fantastic' Upon hitting play, our lives were changed forever.   The screen lit up with the radiating energy of the sun, accompanied by the roar of 1 trillion lions. The angels of heaven rode down from Valhala one the backs of giant white doves, singing 'Hallelujah' from their based lungs. Our eardrums deafened as the intertwining storylines of this gift from god put our minds on a new level. My computer exploded, but the game didn't stop. Because... we were the game.  We were the game... and the game was us...  Warframe ascended us to a new state of being.  A voice descended from the sky. 'Clem!' (My children, it is time.)  We were sucked into the world of Warframe. The game is the way it is today because of us... we fixed the sins of this previously hellish world. It was time. We cured cancer, we ended world hunger, we stopped the birdocracy of the government.   It was over... Everything was right in the world. so please, buy this game and let my hard work not go to wate...

Back when the gram was the best weapon because of its charge attack and the UI was an opaque grey box with your health and abilities. I have since been playing this game on and off for awhile because of its solid combat, sound, and art that I had found very pleasing. During this time I would easily rate the game 6/10.  However this was all before the colossal changes they made, changing the game immensely to the point that now I play it for at least 20 hours each week. I try to get as many of my friends to play this game as I can and I don't even mind doing the same missions over and over again to help them progress. This game is so fun and addicting that it easily has become one of my favorite games of all time.   Gameplay 10/10 it leaves nothing to want, I am completely satisfied with everything the gameplay has to offer.   Sound 9/10 I really enjoy the subtle music that varies from each planet and faction type, from stealth to open combat.  Graphic 9/10 even on its lowest settings it looks amazing and runs really well, and on max graphics this game is stunning.  Overall rating 9/10, I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone I think it is a very enjoyable game.  With this game now adding its next expansion to the story the War Within which is a great sequel to the previous expansion The Second Dream. This game has much to offer in terms of content for new and old players, and its evident that new content will be coming out in the future.",

I wouldn't really recommend it now that it's gotten a little stale I guess? The new story that came out is a strange, and I've heard some rumours about the story contradicting itself or something like that? See for yourself after you've done a few quests. Like, the graphics and that ♥♥♥♥ are AMAZING. I'll give you that, off the top of my head everything looks nice. It's just that, it's not the same ol' Warframe like it used to be. I'll edit more stuff if I ever got the free time to actually know if anything is new, but other than that, I uninstalled it cause I haven't played in a while and didn't understand the new patches. Other than that... Enjoy reading my old review..  vvvvvvvvvvvvv  Warframe is so beautiful in so many ways. The grind. The things you do to become the 'best' in the game. I can't even put it in words why I have hundreds of hours in this game but... here's my daily schedule (as of now): 1. Wake up 2. Get on WARFRAME 3. Play for 12381083123 hours 4. Wait 5. Wait 6.

At first you would probably wonder why the hell am I playing this game which has nearly 9 GB worth of my space, but once you get in it may be hard to understand at first but you'll get the hang of it. After a while it gets more addictive with more story's more planets to explore, joining your friends in an endless battle to defeat the Grinner and Corpus (the enemy's of the game if you didn't know). And then comes the bosses... Join the game in an intense battle between different bosses with different powers. But thats not it! There is your character, your own character with your own weapons and clothing. There are different warframes (characters) to choose from with different statistics, abilities and overall power. To be honest there hasn't been a day since I haven't remembered playing warframe with my friends on the PS4 and having overall fun and RAGE! One minor thing I don't like about this game is that its kind of a pay to win game. But luckily for us there is a system where players who dont like speding money on the game can use in game currency called credits to build weapons and warframes using different materials you find in-game. So... Everyone has a story, What's your's. I would highly reccoment this game to anyone who likes a third person shooter with amazing graphics, a futuristic sci-fi like story and, overall good gameplay.",

I'm serious, go to ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ before you decide to spend time on this. Your life depends on it.  This game will destroy you over and over. I find it difficult to say it's not my favorite game as of late and to be honest, I'm playing a lot of much better games.  The main issue is the developers, and I'm going to name drop. Reb, Megan and Geoff are the only people I respect in that group anymore. Rebecca, a community manager, is one of the nicest, coolest people I've ever come across and she does a really good job connecting to the community. She spends a lot of her time playing the game and messing around with players.  The people designing the game itself do not understand their game, have extremely poor judgement, or are actually ♥♥♥♥ing with us.  One day they say they're going to try to eliminate the grind, and look where we are the next day. RNG to have something spawn in a mission, a difficult ordeal to destroy it, and a high cost to reroll the stats on a mod that only works for one random weapon, and then you might come out even worse than before, because RNG controls the stats and their values.  In essence it's not a bad system, but they're not going to do anything about it. I have very little hope that they're going to fix a game I gush about so much because the last time they 'fixed' something was an Archwing overhaul that actually made a couple of my friends stop playing.  They took a year to get the most recent update out and it's barely two hours of content before we hit a very, very mediocre grind. It's not even that much to grind, either. Riven Mods are such a tiny thing. Come on, guys, if you're gonna make us grind, please at least make it meaningful? Give us plenty to do?  The story, the aesthetic, the graphics... everything else is so ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, but the gameplay is actually beginning to drive me up the wall. I want to support DE, I really do, but I can't even TRUST most of them not to half ♥♥♥ it.  I wrote a review for this game before that begged people to experience it while they could, because things like this don't stay around forever. Honestly, after this update... it can wait.",

            "review_text": "Redefining F2P standards.  Everytime I introduce this game to somebody the first thing they ask is 'How is all this for free? There has to be some catch'.  There is a catch. It is that you need to grind huge amount of time to get certain items especially the latest brand new items. But it's not as bad as you would expect, as a long time hack and slash and 3rd person shooter fan, the gameplay in and itself is extremely fun and I find myself just grinding these things out passively. Before you judge this game you must look at it from a developer's point of view.   I've played my fair share of F2P games, from Planetside to War Thunder to Hearthstone and almost every single 'WoW Killer' MMORPG that's ever released. Hell, I've had worse experiences with B2P games *cough* Black Desert Online *cough*. This game is always that one game I always find myself defaulting back to, and it has very rarely ever let me down if ever, with certain hotfixes that are immediately fixed if they face negative feedback. Why then do I keep returning? Well for starters, it has the best F2P model I have ever seen in a game. Nothing is Pay2Win, period. What you can buy from the shop another player can farm and get. There is no single best weapon, most of them have their strengths and weakness and can be stronger than the other based on the type of enemies you're facing and the way you use them. Rather you can have multiple types of weapons for each situation. The same applies for the Warframes themselves, they act as the classes in game, but instead of the norm, you need to consider them as tools you change out based on the requirements of the missions you're going into. Loki can be useful to not alert enemies and hack data vaults in spy missions, Frost can be used to create a defensive shield around a cryopod or extractor you're trying to defend, and so on. Secondly, you can play how ever you want to, if you love that Devil May Cry hack and slash gameplay you can hold F with a great sword equipped and equip your melee weapon like your primary, allowing you to deflect bullets holding down block, or execute combos based on the stances you have equipped to deal just as much or even more damage than you would just shooting a gun from afar. Vice versa, if you enjoy shooting, you can mod out your gun to deal insane amounts of damage. However, a good player does both and uses them based on the requirements. Might I add that the community in this game is wonderful, which is wierd as it's an F2P game. Join a clan and there will almost certainly be someone to show you the ropes and answer any questions you have. End game content like the high level void relic farms and sorties is also really easy as players are only happy to carry you, just so long as you don't get in their way or do things to inhibit them completing the mission.   Yes you do need platinum (premium currency) for weapon and warframe slots, but these are easy to get, there's a large amount of void missions that are available to you starting from level 6. These missions drop prime parts that can be used to create better primed versions of warframes or weapons. These can be traded to other players for platinum which can be used to fund all your requirements. There is nothing unnatainable in this game. All it takes is some time.   My only issue with this game is I am unable to play any PvP or Conclave matches as the ping is really high probably because my region is far from their servers. They are working on a fix to this by introducing player run servers with rewards. Other than that yes, there are certain issues with buff and nerf hotfixes or the way the implement new systems in the game, for example the new Riven mods rely too much on RnG however the developers always considers player feedback and works on fixing a majority of these issues ASAP. If they do not or cannot fix something they always explain why on their devstreams on twitch held every alternate friday, I would definitely recommend watching those if you're interested in the development of the game. Be a part of the community and contribute by posting any of your issues on forums instead of flaming the game and it's developers, because there really isn't any other game like this out there.  To conclude, I see a lot of reviews saying that you can judge this game after playing for 3 hours, that quite simply isn't the case and you would barely be scratching the surface of what this game has to offer and to truly experience how it's grown in the past few years. You wouldn't be introduced to the archwing mode for example (lets you equip wing-like technology and its own set of weapons and fly around in space and complete all new types of missions). But by far the one thing you need to experience in Warframe is the Second Dream quest. Just to put things in perspective it made me, a long time strong F2P player actually dig up my wallet and buy platinum, platinum I still haven't used, just to support the game and their developers.

However, after having played hours upon hours of Warframe my opinion has changed.   Warframe has the greatest free to play model of any game I have ever played. You are not locked out of any content in the game in any way. All things in the game are completely accessible by simply playing the game. You can pretty much play through the entire game without paying a cent. The benefits to actually paying money into the game are totally worth though. Warframe's core gameplay loop is the largest grind I have ever seen. The best way to rush the grind is to simply use actual money. If you have spent to much time grinding for that one item and have never been able to aquire it and are way to frustrated to continue actually trying you can simply purchase the item for a reletively fair price. I have never once felt like the game was trying to cheat me out of my money.  As for the game itself it is all around enjoyable. The gameplay loop is a great escapist fantasy where you get to play as space ninjas with superpowers and incredible/impractical weapons. If that wasn't good enough for you there is practically infinite customization for anything. Your ninjas, ships, weapons, pets, and shoulder companions are all available for customization. There are also many many subsystems in this game that are poorly explained but completely worth digging into.  Be warned that this game is one giant grind as you try to make yourself an even more badass ninja. The game isn't exactly friendly to newcomers so expect to resort to many a youtube tutorial but the community is incredibly helpful when it comes to finding out what the hell to do. I could not suggest this game more if you are just looking for a fun experience with friends that will leave you wanting to just make one more run despite all those important things you should probably be working on.",

Thats purely subjective though so maybe a little more explaination is called for.  Pros:  - Graphically, its pretty damn beautiful  - Shooting element is very smooth  - Leaping from wall to wall, landing a headshot mid leap from 50 metres away, burning enemies with a draconic effigy all at the same time is pretty cool. You know.... just a little.  - The game just keeps getting more and more added in. The game I play now has so much more to it than it did when I first started playing, and the devs actually care about their game. Which is always a plus.  - One of their quests blindsided me emotionally. Never thought a 3rd person shooter in this style would hit me in the feels but they managed. Any game that actually gets a real emotional response from me is instantly on my praise list.  - A very good free to play model. Theres only a handful of items you can't get by playing the game. Platinum (the real money currency) can be earned by selling mods and parts to other players in game. I've put money into the game but only to unlock more slots for frames and weapons. This wasn't actually necessary as I could have just sold things over the market but... meh. Paid for convenience and to support the game. No regrets.  - Nice pick up put down style game. Log on. Do a mission before going to work/school/that place you have to open your door to access (outside or some name like that... I don't know I try to avoid it whenever I can). Then log out and do whatever. Game will be waiting for you to come back. It won't even judge you. Well, not too much anyway.  It's not all sunshine and rainbows of course. No game is perfect and this is no exception.  Cons  - Controls can be pretty daunting for new players: Once you have this down you'll be leaping around a 3D area and loving every minute, but it doesn't change the fact that; yeah. It's pretty confusing to begin with.  - Pretty samey. I'm gonna expand on this as I know it's a game breaker for some. I personally usually get pretty bored of grindy games. I've enjoyed my fair share of Japanese RPGs but I can count the number of them I've completed on one hand. I start with the best of intentions but after hour 100 of grinding my level just to beat that last boss (I'm looking at you Star Ocean 2. Level 250 to have a chance? Really?) I usually find myself questioning where exactly it all went wrong in my life. Warframe for me, appears to be an exception. Theres a number of different mission types to keep things at least modestly different and fresh, but all of it usually boils down to: Point and shoot until everything is dead. I'd recommend you try it before you knock it as, like me, you may find that actually this is one grind game you can get into.  But it IS still a grind.  - It's pretty complex, what with the numerous weapons, mods, relics, space dogs, space cats (no those last two are real. I'm not making it up), frames and such. There's almost limitless build potential for each weapon, frame or space pet but, obviously, some builds work better than others, generally speaking. I think this is awesome! So why is it under the cons section?  Because if you're looking at the screenshots and hoping for a straight up, mindless shooter where you hit play and kill everything you're gonna be disappointed. You walk into one of the high tier levels unprepared and theres gonna be a lot of holes in your suit and your patience. I won't say this is a cerebral experience but I will say that there's quite a bit of research, planning and character building goes into making an end game frame and weapon build. Also mods. See previous section about grindiness. 300 hours in and I'm still looking for a number of mods to complete some of my favourite weapon builds.  -RNGesus is stong with this one. No seriously. You are at his mercy almost entirely throughout. Unless you're willing to drop that magical Platinum I mentioned earlier. I personally would have preferred to see a bit more control and a little less of RNGesus' smirking face but.... well I love the game enough to forgive it with only one or two desk slams and curses that would go some way to making me poor dear parents question how they raised their son.  Overall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone for the resons I listed in the pros (and possibly the cons depending on whether you thought of them as negatives or not) but there are a number of elements in the game that may turn people off.  Still, which other game gives you the ability to shed your draconic cloak, tunring it into a stationary dragon turret, and dance in the embers of your foes to the music of their dying screams!  ....  OK now I'M questioning my upbringing.",

Melee is also amazing. I recommend this game, no doubt!   More details here.  Warframe's settings has a variety of choices, which is great for people with a weak computer, and also the HUD is very nicely set out in a neat and not all over the place setout. There is a global chat menu, with different sections such as the trading section, recruiting section and most of all, there are clans! Clans are a group of people, and the max member capacity is 1000, AKA Moon Clan. Yes, when clans reach a specific number of members, they will be known as a different clan. Such as my bosses clan Raindogs which is a moon clan. Clans have there own personal building, but we call them Dojos. Varieties of buildings are built in the dojo's, such as hallways, barracks's, weapon labs, and the newly updated lab, Warframe Research Lab!

This game can be a bit difficult to figure out at times, the movement and melee feel odd at first and many of the RPG mechanics have a sizable learning curve, but once I figured them out I found it very enjoyable and rewarding to play.  The free to play model works well for this game, putting money into the game is more a way of saving time than becoming overpowered. Having said that I've put over $100 in to this game (counting the PS4 version as well).  I haven't done much soloing in the game but it is an option if you prefer, however I find the co-op mechanics very unobtrusive and as long as you stay within an appropriate level range you won't have any trouble with other players. That's beside the point that the co-op is an intrinsic part of the game and more importantly is quite fun.  A very fun and addictive co-op RPG shooter.",

Still, solo play or playing with friends to start off as you learn is fun, and once you get the hang of it you should be able to jump right into games with the more experienced players.  This is a free to play game, so micro transactions are rampant. They aren't required for success, but they do make things quicker and easier for you on the crafting end.

I would suggest playing without paying till you know for sure it's the game for you.",

Missions are randomly generated around common tileset, positive or negative, it's a feature that it is well suited to. Tenno (the player's class essentially) are an ancient warrior race in organic-looking powered armor, fighting a crumbling military structure and an intergalactic corporation... it's actually an okay overarching theme to the third person shooter market. While the 'four revives' thing sounds terrible, if you're playing online there will be tons of squads. Teamwork is vital to solid gameplay, so lone wolves may need to spend a little time slumming it before finding a solid loadout.  Overall, I like this game, and definitely plan on playing it more. Solid combat with simple controls at its core with a visually interesting thematic for the rest of the game. some sets are a little repetitive, but the sheer combinations of setpieces they're putting together is staggering, and they're always improving.

The crafting system takes extensive real-time (12 hours for most pieces of gear and 72 hours to craft a new Warframe which are the different classes.)  I enjoyed the game, but I don't like the restrictions on F2P characters. You are limited to only having 2 Warframes unless you pay real money to unlock additional frames. Perhaps this is fair, but the only other option is to sell the warframe you spent so much time leveling in order to try out a new one. Do you get a lot of money for selling your old friend? No, you don't. If you decide that you actually liked the older frame more you have to gather materials and wait 72 hours to recraft and then relevel it. Not fun.",

Pros: Free to play, great graphics, good amount of replayability due to many many different kinds of suites being available, powers and customizables make for a good amount of variables.  Cons: Free to play, but pay to win/have fun. I am getting worried that game companies are going to start adopting this method and it scares me to no end that it will spell disater for the game industry. Its almost ruined a whole generation of games for me and many many others.

Will try to 'nickle &amp; dime' you at every opertunaty. 2. While the graphics are great I noticed some textures failed to load on a few missions. This only happened a few times &amp; it   didn't hinder 'my' enjoyment, but I wanted to mention this. 3. You have to pay to unlock basic colors for weapons &amp; warframes!? (Yes really)  This game plays amazingly. It offers alot in the way of customization &amp; options to personalize everything to your liking, from your powers to your warframe to your weapons, colors &amp; all. However, with all these options there comes a great evil... lots &amp; lots of microtransactions. Now I'm not the kind of person to besmerch the use of microtransaction, in fact its the oposite! I play lots of games with microtransactions in them, such as Dead Space 3 &amp; Mass Effect 3, both of which offer quick ways to get what you wanted for a small real world cash fee. These kind of microtransactions do not bother me at all. Most of the items in Warframe can be earned through lots of hours simply playing the game. This concept is great... until you see things like, having to buy colors to recolor your warframe or weapons! Yes you have to pay real cash to unlock something as simple as color options! I understand having to pay for 'special' color options, but basic color options? Come on, no one should ever have to pay for something that simple.I.E. if you want to make your warframe black, well guess you will need to fork over some real world money for that.  It may sound like I'm hating on this game, but really I'm simply pointing out the same kind of things that are wrong with most F2P games, they expect the player to pay for everyhting in the game with reall money. While I don't mind microtransactions that allow me to simply bypass spending hundreds of hours grinding to open it up through playing, I hate when developers decide to put even the most basic of things such a colors behind a pay wall. That all may infuriate me, but there is no denying that this is a great game with solid controls &amp; great fun to be had in it. Just be aware that while most things can be gotten through hours of play something must be purchased with actual cash. Don't beleive anyone that says it's pay to win though, the things that you can't unlock without paying real money are all just cosmetic things. If you enjoyed Mass Effect 3s multiplayer or just simply love action, RPG, 3rd person shooter hybrids then give Warframe a shot, because inspite of all the microtransactions this is a fantastic game.

            "review_text": "What can I say about Warframe? Well, as you can see I have like three hours on it, so many of the features have not yet been touched. Also, what I can say is I am not really a hard-core gamer. I mean I used to be. But now I got married and a job and everything and I just don't have time like I used to to play video games. So this is coming from... a moderate gamer with some programming experience.  First of all, graphics-wise, I think that the graphics are pretty amazing. The game always manages to catch you in poses and shots that just look great, and the DOF that is in the game only assists in that. I am not running a super high end computer, but it also supports it quite well, meaning that their memory consumption is done quite well; another game of that capacity would have me lagging horribly. I guess that is necessary though, seeing as it was made for PS4 as well. Their particle systems are amazing too, I mean blowing up a crate and wow, the explosion looks fantastic!  Secondly, the controls are the standard controls; no surprises here. In fact, as a 3rd person shooter, there weren't too many surprises, I mean it has standard AI, standard physics, etc.   So what stands out from other games that I have seen? Well first of all, I DO like the customizability of the characters, and their super powers are pretty cool. I love how you can level your character and then based on your level you pick up what is called 'mods' that you equip to the weapon/'tenno'. Also, what I love is that sometimes, just sometimes I am not in the mood to play with some random person, and you have massive control over that. In fact, you can just solo if you want. And speaking of levels, there are upwards of 250 levels in the game!   Now the bad: First of all, this game is still in development and in some ways you can really tell. This is mixed because you know that if there is a problem it will shortly be fixed, and updates are constantly happening. But I am an amateur 3d designer/programmer and sometimes I run into things that make me groan and hope that they fix it soon, and to be fair, these are small things like no enemies on the mini-map, and the containers need to be worked on. One big hitch for me was that I had to dig around to find out how to customize items. The tutorial didn't really offer anything to help me along the way, and everything (from a beginners standpoint) is so expensive that I know that there will be a huge grind to get anything done. Lastly, it seems largely as a 'pay to win' sort of game. Or rather, I suspect that if you pay cash, you probably won't be required to grind like the rest of us. But in this, I sort of understand, I mean it's not really a PvP game, nor is it charging me anything to play, so in the end it isn't really hurting me.  In the end, I give Warframe 8/10 for great graphics, playability, and overall sheer size of the game.",

However, at the end of the day, you're getting an amazing free to play co-op game, which could easily pass as a fully priced retail title. So spending a small amount of money on a warframe or a weapon shows a good sense of appreciation to the developers. So STOP reading these reviews and download the game NOW! :)",

Teamwork is always key in this game and make sure you can work with your team. The combat system features some intresting tactics you can use. One of the coolest ones in my opinion is the abilty to run on a wall while shooting helpless little robot men. It doesn't stop at running on walls. From doing backflips off walls to sliding across from cover to cover, Warframe is something to play for a long time. I am still new to this so I will get to see what else Warframe offers me and what enemies i will have to face next.",

This game does work like other F2P games where it wants you to spend money to expand things, but they do give out free coupons and things which will make buying from their store a lot easier. Recently I received a 75% off as my daily reward, I ended up buying about 1000 Platinum (Warframe points) for only $12.50 USD, which is normally valued at about $50.00 USD.

            "review_text": "So, uh, Warframe. Where to start.  Basically the trailer shows you as a kinda ninja robot thingy who kills whole groups of enemies using unique powers - that's half-true. In Warframe, most of ths stuff is actually gun play. It's third-person, which means you get to stare over your own shoulder a lot, but it's FAST - ie. stupidly fast physics-defying (as in, not even theoretical physics-defying) fights where you say 'hey, I want to kill that boxheaded robotic guy over there. Do I a) slide along the floor, spin around and slice him into two pieces at the waist LIKE A BOSS, or b) shoot at him? Which one is faster? Did I hear a)?'  Crazy trick stunts aside, there's a variety of weapons (although I have to complain that primary weapons are ALWAYS stronger than their secondary counterparts), and the thing that makes this game unique: Warframes.  Warframes being that robotic suit of armour which lets you do really absurd stuff, like pull whole groups off ledges to laand at your feet and get finished off by that great big reaper you just happen to be carrying. Or go so crazy that all the enemies in a large radius around you get confused and start attacking each other. Or shed your skin, or hit the ground so hard everything around you goes slowmo, or maybe even just bog-standard turn invisible.  There are warframes to fit most playstyles - support, tank, glasscannon - and all with unique ability sets, but none of them are biased towards a set of weapons. You don't get a sniper frame. You get a whole load of frames, whether fast, light and high-damaging, or slow but resilient, and you can lump whatever weapon you like on it. One good example is the primary healing/support frame, with her ability that directs all damage taken to nearby enemies while reducing damage done to herself, and slap a manually-detonated 5-shot grenade launcher on it. You can even get a compound bow/railgun with a high Critical chance, put it on the Warframe with an ability that highlights weakspots on enemies and massively amplifies damage to that point, and then run riot in a Survival mission where you need to kill LOADS of enemies to keep your oxygen supplies up.  All in all, this game is fast (if update-intensive), and well worth a try.",

The team stays really active within it, for instance prime time, their weekly thursday night live stream talking about current happenings. Honestly I totally support the community. There's also a decent amount of gear customization with their modding system.  Oh also for an f2p its not even pay to win because all of the best gear isn't even available for the real money currency, platinum.

They are always fixing issues and adding new content, it's like as soon as your starting to get tired of the game they add some new weapons or game mode that make you start griding along again because its something you just have to have. Another aspect of this game I enjoy is the fact that no matter the lobby or who your playing with everyone works together. Its one of the only games I've ever played that no matter who your playing with everyone works together and rarely is there trash talk, maybe some bragging on what you have or how powerful you are but everyone does that :) . But anways back to the game you get to choose from 3 possible characters called Warframes who each have there own individual powers and abilitys pretty cool right? So you choose from those and as you progress through the game you can build and obtain any frame in the game awesome am I right? So you can be anyone have any weapon and you dont have to spend money unless you want to it has a full ingame trade option where you can sale mods and blueprints and some other items as well so there is no need for platinum purchases unless you want so come join Warframe its an amazing game that I have dedicated many hours and so have many of my friends that I have gotten to play it I hope this helps you decide to play the game.

Made changes to compensate against speed runners which ruined the potiental in this game. Enjoyed choosing between being stealthy, or switching to combat. Now near impossible to do multiplayer stealth.' - This was my old review.  I now do recommend this game, however it still is a grind fest. I am happy that they fixed the spawn rates, stealth system, and included a few new game modes to help grinding.  Positives  +Many Game Modes: Survival, Defense, Capture, Spy, etc, all a bit different.  +Lots of different equipments and warframes to chooe from to help ease the grinding.  +Multiplayer runs, dojo/clan systems.  +Clans can build their own base.  +Interesting PvP system for dueling, clan wars, and territory ownership.  +Everything in the shop can be built, best items aren't avaliable for purchase on cash.  +Trading system that includes trading in-game currency and cash-currency  +Material listed planet by planet to help find the materials you need.  +Neat Damage 2.0 and Melee 2.0 system to put a lot of details into equipment and battle.  Negatives  -Lots of items require 12-24 hours to build. Warframes being 72 hours (After the 12 hour parts are built)  -Only option to speed build items is real money.  -Cash store is really really expensive. (Ex: 20 Plat for a colours to customize your own warframe)  -Customization to personalize your warframe all cost money, very few choices can be earned by in-game currency.  -Some of the warframes are a little overpowered, and some are very underpowered.  -Limited slots of owning weapons and warframe. (Cost money to get more slots)  I find once you find your kind of warframe, and weapons. The grind isn't so bad.",

The gameplay is all around satisfying, the variaty is amazing, Melee: Hammers, Swords, Staves, Polearms, Daggers and many more Guns: Machine guns, Shotguns, Snipers, Bows, Laser Cannons, Rocket Lauchers and many more. You can mod all of them as well to a very complicated level, you can adjust your weapons for different status effects Corrosive, Radiation, Fire, Cold, Toxic ect. or go with a crit build to make your crit chance &amp; damage ungodly, there are also many utility mods to add accuracy, ammo amounts, reload speed ect.  EVERYTHING ELSE The graphics are shockingly amazing for a F2P and the soundtrack that comes with it is beautiful. The variation of areas, the icy tundras on pluto, the overgrown forests of earth to the void. The community is pretty damn good, i have not met a single hacker in my many hours of this game and most people are very helpful and polite. The game will last you ages, as there is no clear end to it as it gets updated pretty frequently.

It offers alot of diversity when it comes to weapons, items, fighting styles etc. And a big point is that it isn't a Pay 2 win game since you can nearly get everything in the game without spending a single cent. As for myself i only spent 5€ once to buy some warframe slots, which can only be bought with platin (ingame premium currency). But other than this weapon slots and colors there is nothing else which can't be farmed. I do recommend to be a fan of grinding games though since you will need some patience to get certain mods for example (it also doesn't go any faster with plat).   The Mod System is also a great feature which makes it possible to fit your own playstyle. Whether you want a stealthy gameplay or a full aggro tank is your choice, but keep in mind that you should always try to pick something teamfriendly because especially in highlevels it's important to have teamwork at it's not really useful going solo into a group of enemies which maw you down in a few seconds.

Now this platnium, can Buy practicaly ANYTHING in the game, if you spend enough, you can buy everything in the game, give or take a few items that are locked by rank  Now the last thing i want for this game, is for it to be a Pay to win game, now i have a suggestion, let their be transactions (Hear me out!) BUT wait till your rank 5 or-so , so you get a jist of the game, before you go and waste it.  Those were the Bads, here are the goods  1) a VERY good, story, i personally took time to read the story, wich dosnt happen alot,   2) theirs a variety, you dont HAVE TO use gunplay, if u do not wish,their are other ways ( Stealth Being One)  3) theirs a rather big community for this game, at least 10,000 whenever im online, which makes me happy  Anyways thats MY review, and most of MY thoughts my rating for this game, is 7/10 :)",

            "review_text": "Where do i begin?  Warframe is in my opinion the single greatest F2P game Ive ever seen, even though it has quite some space for improvement. The main thing is the lack of endgame content second is the fact that you will have to spent some money on Ingamecurrency, if you don't want to spend tonns of hours on getting your gear onto a level from which you can get everithng without platinum (ingame currency).  The developers have announced what the Endgame will look like and it seems not to be to far away, but even without Warframe has plenty of different feeling weapons to craft, level up and upgrade so the wait for endgame isn't that tragic, I think it's amazing how long Warframe managed to exist without endgame content, somethng where many games like Guild wars for example have failed.  To the Pay2Win point: It really isn't that big of a deal as it looks at first, the developers regularly give opportunities to get some of the most important Items which can get you trough the game without paying, but it will take some extra time and i personally reccomend spending e few bugs for a smoth start. The only Thing i would really buy are Warframe and weapons slots to keep up a good diversity of weapons and characters  The really good things about the game: It has a very fast and dynamic gameplay with a huge amount of different weapon and 'characters' the three different enemy factions all desire a different strategy and with advanced levels and levelmodes it stays challanging for a really long time.  It has really fancy graphics and every faction has a different stile of tileset, which look amacing (the architecture of the Orokin Void, 'hidden places of the original faction which is mostly wiped out, just looks amazing).  Right now they are recreating some of the old features, like Meele fighting will get an improvement and many of the old lame bosses get new mecanics, there are many updates quite regularly which keep the game interessting.  And last i want to point out, what is the best feature: Each Warframe, they behave like character classes in other games, have a different theme and the amazing thing is that each warframe makes you play differently and the feeling of the different classes really comes across very well, something i haven't managed to find in a game this intence since World of warcraft. right now there are 18 Different Warframes and the game makes you wanna play in diferent stiles, from offensive pre Force (Rhino) to tactical deffensive (Frost) over an exposive antimatterwarframe called Nova to stealthy Warframes every shade of tactical Warframe is available and quite balanced.

You can even trade in-game items for the real-world currency (Platinum) to make it possible to get what ever you want.

All of the weapons (except a few that were for founders only) are all available in game, purchasable with the credits you earn fighting or by their platinum (Real money). Using in game currency you have to purchase the blueprints through the store (They don't cost platinum) then you have to grind for the materials. And I mean grind, look at what is available where before you purchase, because it'll take you a while to get to the next location and time to farm the materials in that sector, then it takes 12 hours (Yes, realtime) to complete it, then you have to level it up to add mods.  Basically rinse and repeat that cycle of buying, farming, building, and you have Warframe.

Warframes and weapons are crafted and upgraded. There are several mission types and a large number of levels.   The problems:  -Each level is one of about 6 designs. -The missions types all come down to running into a room, guns blazing, and pew-pew'ing everything. -The endgame is the same shooting and grinding as the early game. There really isn't anything to do once you have your weapons maxed other than collect rare items. -The trading environment consists of many many players who have lots to sell but very few players who are interested in buying what they can grind for themselves. -The warframe balance just doesn't seem right. There are definitely some OP abilities. -It doesn't really matter which warframe a player uses since there isn't really any class diversity. Just pew pew with any warframe, and when you have the energy, use your autokill button. -Low and high level players are often grouped, resulting in the high level players running to the end while the low level (or unequipped) player frustratingly gets to kill nothing. This also leads to a perception that the game is trivially easy, which it often is.  On the positive side,  +it's easy to play this game for an hour or two, leave, and come back the next day since there are crafting times.  +Almost all significant items in the in-game store can also be bought or crafted without spending real money. +Grinding and collecting items is a staple of a lot of video games. It's popular because it keeps players interested. +The most recent update added a number of new weapons, a new mission type, a new warframe, and a HUD overhaul. +Periodic alerts offer quests for players looking for purpose.

            "review_text": "Totally underrated game with a surprising amount of depth. Very cool visual style &amp; graphics, loads of playstyles and weapons with a mods system that allows for a lot of customization and control. Free to play with premium currency(platinum), but here's another bit of awesome: almost all the frames &amp; weapons can be built using blueprints that drop in game; these require in game credits and resources that also drop. So you can spend a little bit of time farming and build something that could've cost you 5, 10, even 20$ worth of platinum(real money).   CONS: It's still in its infancy and has some bugs, but for the most part, I've seen the majority go away in the 5ish weeks I've been playing. Also, the voice acting is horrible. The voice of the Lotus will get very old very fast. You can just turn it off and pay attention for what is changing/happening. Some of the drops can be irritating. For example, if you want to build a particular warframe, you have to farm the assassination (boss) mission that drops those parts. You need 3: a helmet, a chassis, and systems. Then you can buy the frame blueprint in the market. Once all 3 pieces are built, those become the components of the frame blueprint. This is a great system, as I've said, but it can get tedious when you need one rare resource and have to start farming for those. So far I've not run into much I couldn't build with a little farming/grinding/patience. But keep in mind some higher level and rare blueprints will take some rediculous amounts of high end rare resources.   All in all I highly recommend more people start playing this. It's set to launch with the PS4, and it deserves that larger market. Pretty cool to get in it while it's still being built/open beta.",

            "review_text": "Warframe is a F2P game that lives up to most of the conventions associated with the payment model. Once you get beyond the first few hours, it does its best to try to loosen your purse strings. However, unlike many other free-to-play games, Warframe is honest in its assertion that it is, in fact, a free game to play. The time investment required to gain notable progress is not unfair. You won't find yourself hitting any brick walls in terms of progression or difficulty. All in all, Warframe is playable for those without much (or anything) to spend--something to be appreciated in the present landscape of F2P offerings.   With the F2P issue covered, lets look at what Warframe does well. Firstly, it looks great. The technical graphics and art direction are both top-notch here, especially for a F2P title. The animations are fluid and dynamic. The gameplay is easy to to pick up and the default keybindings are fairly intuitive. The warframes (classes, essentially) are all distinct and, for the most part, fun to play--I'd recommend avoiding Excalibur for new players, it's a boring warframe. The weapons and abilities are unique and feel impactful. Levels can be entered into quickly and generally don't take long to complete, which allows for players to squeeze in playtime when time is an issue. Finally, the servers are fairly stable and the cooperative play is well done.   There are, however, some things that Warframe doesn't do well. For one, the AI is pretty poor. Most enemies act as nothing more than cannon fodder, running headlong into your stream of projectiles. The levels are largely recycled and very samey. Also, there isn't much in the way of weapons and powers. If you're looking for deep customization beyond aesthetics, you won't find it here; which is peculiar considering most F2P titles attempt to load up the unlockable content to as large a degree as possible. Lastly, the game can be a huge timesink. While I stated earlier that the time required for progression isn't necessarilly unfair, Warframe manages to fall on the high side of grindy timesinks. This can be seen as a negative or perhaps simply as something that comes with the territory, your choice.   My recomendation of Warframe comes with a qualification. This is a grindy game that appeals to people that enjoy a bit of mindless farming (or in this case, a lot of mindless farming). If you're looking for a game to sink some hours into with simplistic, yet polished, gameplay, then Warframe is perfect for you.",

The amount of weapons, pets and warframes (suits) is fenomanel and you can get almost everything for free.  So first I'll tell you the negatives. This is a game where you will need to hide behind cover but there is no proper cover system witch is a big problem. At first it may be hard to adjusting to having to crouch behind objects and move out of cover to shoot people but it is easy to get used too. The great thing is once your character ranks up a bit this becomes less and less of a problem.  I would suggest playing this game while it's free because it's going to become a full game (is in beta at the moment) and so this may add a price tag. Premium is something that can really make things easier but i don't suggest getting it because buyihng stuff always seems to be a waste.  The extensive amount of stuff is another thing. While there are about 14 warframes (suits) which are all completely different some a really overpowered and others underpowered, it doesn't work. The overpowered ones are hard to get and underpowered ones you start with (the best starting warframe is Loki btw) (second best is excalibre. I recommend buying blueprints for everything because their so much cheaper the only issue is you have to wait to build stuff and you have to collect items. Sentinels are really overpowered and bad for stealth (unless you get the one for stealth). They are basically pets and shoot enemies for you.  All around this is an awesome game with great gameplay it just has a couple of flaws. If you have enough friends to play with it can be very addictive but if you don't have any friends that are interested don't bother playing it because this game is made for multiplayer.",

It's a very fun game- the unique art style, extremely fast gameplay and fun weapons make the the first three or four hours very enjoyable indeed. I can say it's like no other game I've played before, and the idea of Space Ninjas still amuses me. The HUD's pretty slick and minimalist, and I do like the enemy design and the variations in the factions. The bosses are pretty fun to tackle, and the community is very good, as free-to play games go. However, there are some limitations. I'll ignore the occasional bug or glitch- it's still in beta. Level design can be a touch repetive, and there is a definite pay-to-win mechanic. I found that after about ten hour's play, I hit The Wall. I wasn't leveling up fast enough to compete with the other players and I couldn't buy any new weapons or any of the titular Warframes.  Overall, I'd recommend this if you're looking for a new way to play a 3PS and don't mind occassional glitches or paying real money for better ingame items. Also, space ninjas. Space. Ninjas. 7/10.",

            "review_text": "WarFrame you are basicly a SpaceNinja that kills everything in his/her path. Iv played the game now and again since it came open first time, and it still is a very good game to come back to. I might say its one of the best Action MMOs iv ever played, since every new update adds so much more to the game. And going back to it now after a new months after it went 'Release' (1.0 when beta is over) I have to say..  THERE IS SO MUCH THINGS I still havent seen. But to be more specific about the game.  The game is like a Hybrid of Ninja Gaiden and Phantasy Star Online (with the online and having a few skills etc) Where you go around in diffirent maps (worlds) to choose what kind of Missions you want to do. There are a few diffirent missions in the game, for example, Survival, Defending, Sabotage, Raid, Capture etc.  Than beside of all the diffirent Random Level Designs and all the diffirent World Layouts (the overall Biom of the map you are in) It gives you abit more of a Replay value, since you might replay a few of the same maps to get some resources you might need for a weapon Blueprint (going to get to that soon) or maybe you want a new WarFrame Blueprint and is farming bosses.  But you wont be Farming to much nowadays since iv heard they have changed it to the better. Though it still was a blast just going in killing him over and over, and get random mods you could put in your weapons to make it stronger.  About Blueprints of Weapon and Warframes (Classes) You can buy everything with real money, but i cant say anything in this is Pay to win, since you can get EVERYTHING! Without laying a single dollar, this inturn makes you wanna play tha game more, because it doesnt feel like the game is unfair. Though it might take some time more if you do it in the Blueprint way, you can still get it without paying, so i call it worth.  First the Blueprints (Warframe or Weapons) does cost Credits, and after you bought it with credits you simply go to the Foundry (your more or less 'Blacksmithing Creation-corner of Awesome Weaponry/Gear') It sais what kind of things you need to get it. (Materials, like well things you get from enemies and around the world's)  The Mods (IMPORTANT ♥♥♥♥♥) The Mods in this game are well Mods. (not game mods that change how the game is) But Mods to weapons, that can add Fire Damage / Ice Damage. Maybe you want your melee Weapon to swing faster, well done.. Or you want to Crit more often.. Well Done. Or maybe Reload or have more ammo. Done (You do need to find them first, but that isnt to hard since the only thing you need to do is to go around killing everything and pick up small 'reactors' (Sure looks like it) And you are good to go) There are Mods for your WarFrame also, which does almost the same as weapons. You have your 'Class mod' which is 4 diffirent abilities that you can upgrad to make them stronger, then you have the normal Warframe mods, which is. More health, Shield, running speed, staminga ETC.  And here is why i say its Like Phantasy Star Online. You have these small robot Pets (that you can either buy, or create from blueprints) These buggers are extremely good, depending on your gamestyle. Some are for stealth, some for raw Encounter and some are more balanced. And yes, these buggers also have Mods, but i think you get the point of how they work at this moment.  Overall, i could just babbel about the game for ages. But why read this and hear what i can say about it, when its FREE to PLAY. Just press that Install Button and Play it yourself and see how you like it. I Though HIGHLY recommend you atleast try the game out for a few hours, till you get a hang of it. Have a good one, and happy Hunting!",

Warframe's got accseptable everything, and if you remember a certain Xbox 360 game 'Dark Sector' than this is definatly a game to throw a little a cash ar for the fun. 3/5 stars -1 for 12 hour waiting time to craft items -1 for revival micro-transaction, my least favorite one of the cash-purchases in the game.",

A SLEW of battle suits (i.e. 'Warframes') all with different powers and abilities. Oodles of handguns, knives, bows, rifles, shuriken, swords, polearms, shotguns, machineguns, energy weapons, biological weapons and high explosive weapons. Dozens of dynamic, on-the-fly environments. Wall running, climbing, jumping, sliding, fliping, John Woo film style leaping sideways with a pistol in each hand shooting style acrobatics. About a dozen mission types. Everything is configurable with atrifacts known as mods. Even mods can be augmented by fusing them together to make them more powerful.  Check it out, it's worth the download and playing through the intros if you enjoy action games. If you really like it, consider tossing Digital Extreme a few coins for some 'platnum' and buy some extra weapon and Warframe slots... about the only thing you can't get via just playing the game.

            "review_text": "Firstly, I need to state very loudly and clearly that this game is in open beta. My review is based on an unfinished product, and I will be resubmitting the review when the game reaches final release.  Warframe is a third-person sci-fi cooperative shooter. Teams of up to four players (Tenno) take control of biomechanical Warframes and fight their way through procedurally generated levels. Although the gameplay is addictive, the driving force of the game at the moment is gear grinding. Players grind for components build Warframes, resources to build weapons, and mods to attach to Warframe and weapons.  My major gripe with the game in it's present state is the lack of variety. Although the procedurally generated levels are gorgeous, the objectives are repetitive and the game world feels very generic. I'm thoroughly hooked on the game, but I would really like to see more unique environments and some more story driven content. Lazy level design and a lack of story content are fine if the game is heavily PVP focussed, but Warframe's focus is almost entirely PVE.  One advantage that being PVE focussed does have is that the F2P with microtransactions model it uses is almost immune to the 'pay to win' scenario found in so many F2P titles. The only place where you really need to spend money on this game is for inventory slots to store weapons and Warframes. This is a bit of a burn, but fortunately they're not terribly expensive. $11.50 AUD will get you enough platinum for 5 warframe slots and 10 weapon slots, which should be enough to cover a casual player's expanding arsenal. Platinum can also be used to purchase Warframes, weapons, credit and experience boosters, cosmetic items, and a number of other items. Personally, I found Warframes and weapons were horribly overpriced, especially they since can all be obtained for free in game. Buying items also (at least currently) reduces the available experience of the game, since about 90% of it is currently grinding for items.  Overall, I'd say this is an open beta with a lot of promise (and I'm certainly already hooked), but it really needs some more engaging content if it's going to make the long haul.",

You can clearly see the amount of effort and love that are going into making this, and it seems that with every large update, the game just manages to become more aluring.  There are quite a few approaches you can take on gameplay, especially concerning the weapons you choose. These can offer incredible diversity in playstyle, which one can further change according to their tastes, when it comes to customisation. The amount of mobility is also a great factor in this game, allowing you to perform a variety of acrobatic moves to get around, or even get the upper hand on enemies, if you know what you're doing.",

Melee is elegantly handled with a single key instead of having to manually equip a weapon. Putting weapons together the long way is just the right amount of work to actually be kind of satisfying instead of the anticipated unbearable grind. The universe and art direction are excellent; the Tenno are badasses, and it's practically impossible to not be awesome. Even playing online with random guys isn't too awful; the average player barely even talks during a game, although you do run into some guys who are apparently hosting the game from a TI-83 in Kenya. All in all, I mean, it's a game about future space ninjas with guns and swords and superpowers, so I'm kind of predictably addicted.

The customization in warframe can make the player look advanced or cool in certan ways. The player can mainly customize there helmate, torso, arms, and legs. The player can also customize the swords color. The last feature i would like to go over is guns and bows. The guns are for people that like to go into the fight and have a strong wepon at there side. As for the bow, its way stronger and is better used at long range.

Switching seamlessly from dual fire pistols to twin glass swords to finish an enemy off with a horizontal bisection never gets old, and the parkour system is just icing on the cake. Not to mention the amazing weapon variety, ranging from freeze rays to boomerangs. Fair warning, though: it can get repetitive, so, unless you have friends to play with, it may only be fun in small doses at a time, but it is very fun.",

The character customization is also very good, even if you don't have any money since some extra colors are available to you for free. And, if you do have the money, the possibilites are nearly endless from changing what type of Warframe you use to what body type it has to the decorative armor pieces that it wears, and the various color palletes give a vast aray of possible color combinations.  The only thing I'd even think to complain about is how the maps tend to repeat, but, at the same time, I like how the maps are generated randomly from a specific set of rooms each time a mission is started, preventing the entire map for a mission being the same multiple times in a row. There are a couple glitches I have come across, though, but glitches are to be expected in pretty much any game, and the ones I've seen are nothing that really ruin the game's fun and excitement. There's also that fact that there is no PvP, except in Clan Dojos, but that is so easy to overlook with how exciting everything else is.  Overall, this could perhaps be one of the best games, if not the best game, I have ever played. It is definitely worth the download, and you really have nothing to lose if you happen to not like it.",

            "review_text": "When i first stumbled over Warframe, i only read something about Ninjas and Space. It sounded cool to me so i gave it a try.   Boy was i surprised!  Before i give you a little more text i sum up the pros and cons. Starting with cons.    Cons:    - You are 'forced' to use a lot of different equipment (Warframes, Weapons, Companions) to increase your Mastery Rank.  This is actually not that bad since mastery rank isn't that important. You unlock a few things with it, mostly weapons, but if you like to try a lot of different equipment you'll get the MR anyway.   - Gameplay is a bit repetitive. Basically everything comes down to slay enemies. Lots of them. In Style. Is this really a con?  - Items in the in-game-market are pretty expensive. But there's also the trade channel, where you can get better stuff cheaper.      Pros:    - There are very few things in the game where you 'have to' spend real money for. Most notably to increase space in inventory for warframes and weapons (no space limit for ressources though). The prices for these are pretty low however and it's totaly ok. I put the 'have to' in brackets because the basic space is sufficient if you only play every now and then.   - No Pay 2 Win! If you invest money in the game you will only get things faster but they won't be better. You can get everything in the game just by playing it, besides some decorations and the afore mentioned inventory space.   - The best equipment can not be bought in the ingame-market but has to be acquired by playing higher level missions. It can, however, be bought from other players. This is also a possible way to get your hands on the real-money-currency, platinum, without spending real money. Pretty cool.   - Fantastic customization options, both visual and technicaly. You can paint your warframes, companions, and weapons and also attach decorational armor on them (which costs real money, but has no effect besides looks). You can even chose different animation sets for your character! There are hundreds of so called mods to improve the stats of your equipment to customize it so it suits your needs.   - Tons of weapons! There's everything from heavy machine guns to assault rifles, shotguns, pistols, shurikens, bows and xbows, sniper rifles, swords, hammers, axes, whips (!), flame throwers, grenade launchers... you name it! I have never seen a game with so many different weapons in it.   - Style! The animations are excellent and there's a wide variation of moves you can do, like wall-walking, somersaulting, sliding, you can equip different stance mods on melee-weapons to change the way you swing them, there are melee-combos, you can dismember enemies, pin them to walls, throw them in the air... Best thing about this is that despite the complex possibilities the controls are very accurate and easy to handle.   - A lot of good ideas have slipped into the game, for example the way clans are handled (You build a large space station with your clan, the so called dojo, whose interior is fully customizable as well, there's support for different sizes of clans and so on) or the fact that your base of operations is a speaking spaceship which is a bit mental .   - The game is free!!1   To finish my little review let me say that warframe is not only one of the best f2p-games i've ever seen but it can hold it's ground against full prize games with ease.   If you don't have it yet, get it, it's free damnit!",

Its not pay to win, more like pay to look badass.  Graphics are really well done and mission design is absolutely beautiful. (I am not a big fan of instances, but I think it works best like that for this game).  Fast combat, parkour skills, variety of melee and ranged weapons (swords, bows, kunais ect.), a lot of planets, countless missions, many warframes to chose from every having its own unique stile of play.  Game is updating every few days with bug fixes and balances,  Things I dislike: - Better and more balanced PvP and Cephalon (allow more weapons and mods). - Some bugs like falling trough elevator, getting stuck in invisible hole and damn I hate when I am climbing small box or a wall and just do backflip 20 metters behind into enemy lines. - It takes decade to craft something and when you find all parts then wait 12h to 3d (its realistic trough). - Too addictive.

My first review was honest but after playing more, i can honestly say this is great to play with friends but going into this solo, you never find a group. Especially at low levels, PvP is horrible unless you spend money on good items. And seems very repetive with the missions, all it does is mix them up a little.",

            "review_text": "This game is quite impressive. I'm a keen RPG and Sci-Fi fan, and playing as a variety of different cyborg ninja's in space just really hits the spot.  There is a lot of grinding involved, but dont let that fool you, there is plenty of content here to keep you interested.  From needing to unlock the 20 more warframes, to the dozens of weapons, sentinels, modding, trading, syndicates and missions - you wont run out of things to do too soon.  Its f2p, and as such there is a market where you can use actual money to buy weapons and frames etc. The in game credits earned via playing missions can also be used, but only for a limited number of items by comparison. For example, you could pay 200 platinum ($20 buys 370 plat atm)) for a weapon or frame, or instead use 20-100k purchasing the blueprints for them. This cannot be done with all weapons and frames at rank 1, as some of them are xp-locked - requiring more levelling up and 'mastery' test to be passed. Some materials can also be purchased this way.  Keep in mind that any blueprints also require credits to complete, plus all the grinding to get all the materials that you need (some of which simply are not available early on via drops), so it is much quicker to pay real money, but far less satisfying (for me).  The community seems friendly enough as far as online games go, with plently of people looking to group up and do quests together (where the game really shines) or trade items and talk tactics.  Visually, its very good. Plently of eye candy and a nice smooth frame rate even on maxed settings (check my profile for sys specs). The audio is crisp and environmentally accurate.  I use kb + mouse for controls, and I found them to be very fluid, although a little tricky to master without some practice. This was only a matter of probably half an hour, so nothing excessive there. The combat is fast paced and really agile. You can wall-run, slide, spin, block, deflect shots, and generally do awesome ninja stuff all whilst waving around swords, guns or anything in between.   Lets not forget the character abilities, which are unique for each frame. There use is limited by your power reserves, which can be replenished mid battle from drops, making for some strategicly mixed combat. Powers can be damage dealing, defensive, buff, or healing, with each frame having a certain style or focus on the types of powers. For example, Volt frame uses the energy in a mostly electrical sense - dealing shock bolts of lightining or creating a defensive energy barrier, super speed or electrical overload AoE.  The atmosphere works very well, fairly dark sci-fi style (dead space-esque) with plenty of unknowns and suspicious dialogue and characters going on. There's not an exessive amount of gore, but carving enimies in halves or setting them ablaze, electrocuting, freezing, shooting or bashing the hell out of enemies is certainly violent - but is on a level that works without going overboard.   There is of course, quite a lot of customisation to boot also. You can paint your space ship, choose the colour schemes inside the ship, as well as buy decorations and attachments for your frames and weapons.  I could go on but honestly I wouldnt know where to stop. All in all this is a great game, especially for a f2p.  10/10",

The first 100 hours or so of gameplay you will love the game. While the maps (tilesets) are the same ones over and over, I believe that is one of its strengths. The game is incredibly fast paced, (I find that going back to other games I'll become somewhat irritated at first at how sloooooow everything is at first,) and the fact that the game has repeated maps helps with completing objectives fast with your squad (up to four players,).  There are maaaany different weapons and warframes (the main characters) you can find blueprints for, craft, and, yes, spend countless hours farming for (And many of these weapons and frames are competely insane, like a frame that can fire disco balls of death, or a gun that fires streams of tentacles).  And herein lies one of its greatest weaknesses. Its a farming game. Once I got to around 300 hours of gameplay or so, I realized that there are many ways that you can farm and not even have to PAY ATTENTION to the game. I'm not going to list specifics, lest they get changed, but suffice it to say some warframes can be used in conjunction with a group of people and maps that allows you to essentailly pay only a few seconds attention to the game, while your frames sit around and murder countless enemies, hours on end, in the hope that you will get that rare blueprint, that one Loki Systems or Volt Chassis by the time you decide to leave the mission after an hour or so, only to come back and do it all again.  So in conclusion, TRY WARFRAME. There are countless ways to get stuff without paying money for Platnium in game, its a looot more common than you realize. The game is incredibly awesome, and the feeling of doing awesome ninja moves thorugh the air and tearing through hundreds of enemis with your insanely awesome abilites and weapons is something you will not find in other games. BUT, and this is why I don't play as regurarly as I once have, don't play it to farm. Or else you'll just be spending your time Farming to get stuff to help you get more stuff, in an endless cycle. Play it, don't farm the crap out of it.   ",

Pros 1. Skills are very good and with multiple warframes come diffrent skills allowing to to build ur perfect build c what i did there lol. 2.They added new parcore elements to the game like running on walls running up walls. 3.They added mods no not ur typical mods like on minecraft mods in warframe are like bonus skilz to back up ur build. 4. there are diffrent weapons and melee weapons to custimize to ur likeing like bows for example and then theres assault rifles to pistols. 5. the melee weapons are varied to the players likeing and that is absoulty stunning with u think of melee u think of swords well in warframe u have scythe to staffs to maces ect... and all are sci fi themed  overall this game is stunning but just like any game it has its flaws but the perfect atmosphere for alien game and there even a matchmaking pvp games.       as u can see i dont have that much hours on it but i have enough experients to let u no u must try",

Probably the best free to play model I've seen. 90% of the game can be made yourself without the need for buying 'platinum', the real money currency of Warframe. Most pure platinum buys that can't be built or found are purely visual or ways to reduce the build time.   Typically if you were to build, say, a new basic gun it would require various resources and some ingame money called credits. At first the resources will be hard to get, but after a while you will be swimming in them. A basic weapon could be build for free with all the require resources in about 12 hours. I usually build it before bed so by the time I come back its ready.  Warframes, or the characters you play as, take a lot longer. You need three pieces, each one with its own resources, and they all take 12 hours to complete. Once you have the parts you build them together which takes about 36 hours. Painful I know, but its a lot better than paying 200+ platinum for it.   Most of the game is about being as stylish as hell. This isn't one of those games where you feel like a dirt farmer until you reach a high level. Nothing is better than sending a room of enemies, and adjacent rooms, flying with one Rhino stomp or slashing up enemies left and right with Valkyr.   The game is still beta so there isn't much of an epic story to go with it. No clear credits roll ending. However, the team does release a lot of updates and they are constantly tweeking the game or adding in new warframes and weapons.",

The game is famous for being a repetitive grinding machine, I find this depends on what missions you choose to play, but yeah if you want to progress with your weapons and frames and get stronger you will have to do the same thing over and over alot. Probably the greatest feature of warframe though is the fact you can literally be a alien wizard ninja with a jetpack. My biggest concern with warframe that almost made me click downvote is that they have a tendency to make big updates that suddenly make the game 35x harder to run. I once had to stop playing for a wohle 2 weeks because my computer couldnt load their new fancy animated loading screen......... they like to put random crap into the game that is unnecesary that kills fps. more of a game dev problem than the game itself however. 8/10 i suppose (potential 10/10 if they ever stop messing around and fix the obvious connection problems)",

What matters is how you play it. And when it comes to Warframe, you can play however you want thanks to the customization traits to the game, the massive amounts of characters (Warframes), Weapons, Pets/Sentinels, and Mod array. You can play HOWEVER you want and WHATEVER you want. And guess what? You can do it for FREE! Sure, waiting for things to complete building can be a little boring, and repeating missions for resources to complete said things can be a bit frustrating, but that's just part of the experience. You want good items? You have to work for them. You get there eventually.",

Due to DE's lack of competence and poor design, they decided to leave the game and find something better.  -&gt;Do you like co-op action? Do you enjoy throwing yourself out there to do missions with other bros? Do you find yourself yearning to experience what it would be like to be a space ninja with 3 other guys while tearing apart baddies? Then Warframe is NOT for you. Environments are poorly-designed with little to no creativity invested; the enemies tend to sit behind corners even when you casually walk up to them and just stand there; the controls are so poorly coded that often-times you either overshoot or undershoot a jump and end up getting stuck on some stupid crap.   -&gt;As of January 25, 2015 DE has not only ignored a recurring issue with multiple players not being able to join sessions, but has asked the playerbase to compromise their own security or mess something up in the hopes of rectifying the issue on their own. Unfortunate for DE, not everyone is dumb enough to compromise for their sake.   -&gt;Weapon and frame balancing. Just take a moment to think of your favorite mmo. Certain builds did certain things and made doing things like quests and whatnot either more easier or just benefitted you greatly. DE scrapped the model and ♥♥♥♥ on it before putting it in a paper bag and putting it on someone's front doorstep. They then lit it on fire, pressed the doorbell, and ran behind some bushes to watch the ensuing hilarity. I kid you not, that it the EXACT mindset of DE's staff when designing weapons and frames. They only recently made fixes to necromancer (nerfed him to the point of near-uselessness) and nova which means nothing when the primes are still varying between garbage and OP. Oh, and a majority of players prefer Loki simply for the speed and stealth aspect. Also, invest real life money in this game if you want to get on top because that's EXACTLY how you get all the best gear.   -&gt;The archwing. Whoever was the glue-snorting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to design this thing needs to be fired. In concept it's fine. However, the missions and aethetics are so bad you often find yourself avoiding the missions if only to NOT use the stupid thing. It's not even so much that it's difficult to control as there just isn't any joy to be had. I can't properly explain what is wrong with it because there is too much. If you have the urge to play warframe even after reading this review, give the archwing a shot and see what I'm talking about.  -&gt;RNG. Abbreviation for Random-Number Generation. What that means is that you are NEVER guaranteed to get the same number twice. So you know how a lot of other MMO's either have poor RNG for drops while others are basically the equivalent of beating a pinata without a blindfold? Imagine if that pinata could move and think, you were blindfolded, you both were on a frozen lake, people were throwing snowballs at you all the while, and your only weapon of choice was a twig. Yes, it's that bad. 'Luck' isn't even an applicable term because the RNG is THAT bad. Oh, and also some materials for making certain weapons and crap aren't available in the cash shop so you end up spending HOURS grinding for something like argon crystals and maybe coming away with 1 at most. This isn't rewarding the player. This is forcing them to suffer for your incompetence.  To sum it up, liquidate the entire staff behind this project and either kill it (merciful option) or sell it to a competent developer. Hell, give it to EA and let them fix it. Oh, and yes, I am suggesting you give what could have been a potential gem to the Hitler of gaming. EA can't ♥♥♥♥ it up anymore than DE has. And that's a REALLY depressing thought.  3/10",

            "review_text": "This is a rather surpising addtion to my steam list. I'm used to games either being keyboard only with a passible controler support or the reverse. With this game, it feels like it was made for both from the outset. Makes me rather happy. While I have been getting used to wasd controls due to games like WoW and Guild Wars 2, I am still what is often refered to as a 'console-tard' when it comes to control type preference.  The combat system is nice. Hit detection is a bit loose, but forgiving and having some nice 'weakspot' options. Each frame has four powers you can level up with often useful secondary effects. I currently play the starting Mag frame, and not only does she have a great pull that does damange, but her second power is a shield power that not only can strip enemies down and replenish allie, it also can replenish things you are protecting and harm some enemy types (such as the pain in the butt corpus). You are give a nice load out of a Main ranged, a secondary ranged, and melee. You get to chose your starting load out in the tutorial mission.  I would advise you choice on whether you are going to solo or team up a lot more. While melee choices of the Skana (katana) or staff are really up to you, there is the choice between steath and attack. Your main and secondaries revolve around this. The Braton and the pistol are great for running and gunning with friends, while the Bow and kunai are best for solo stealth. Mix, match, and have fun.  One thing that I really love about this is that the Melee not only has a slightly different control scheme that helps with combat up close, but also can be used even if you have your ranged weapons out. Granted it's just the basic attack combos with no charge or blocks; but this does allow for stealth kills up close if you snuck up on an enemy and especially if you chose the loud Braton instead of the silent, but slower, Paris Bow.  The graphics are amazing for a game that has been free to play out of the gate. Mod options are plentiful and the ♥♥♥♥ that you can basically earn -everything- in the game... at least from a functional stand point, is rather nice.  Naturally cosmetics are the main name of the game in the cash shop. Yeah, you can outright buy frames, weapons, tools and what not, but none of that is cash shop only, only the skins are specific in some cases. I think my only quam is that a -lot- of the color optoins are locked behind the platnum wall. While they are kinda cheap, the cost ratio for cash to platnum is a bit on the rediculous side. Not as bad as I've seen in the past just... a little skewed for my tastes and can make that first purchase a bit of a difficult one (my friends could tell you how easy it is to get me to spend money in most games for even just a small costume or larger bag space, so this is saying something)  Speaking of bag space: there is none. Sorta. When it comes to having Frames and pets (i think the pets, having checked yet) you do need to buy more space for each new one you get. BUT, either you've been playing the game awhile or have actually dipped into the cash shop already. Add in the fact that you get 50 platnum out the gate, and Those frame slots go for 20 a pop. Not bad all things considered.  But as for inventory space? Infinite. And it's necessary. Crafting is actually a really big thing in this game. It's a simple, straightfoward system you perform on your ship. Often you are going to find matierals all over the missions as pick ups, and you can even get frame, weapon, tool, etc blueprints for the credits you earn. It's through these aspects that you get all the stuff I was mentioning before. Through the credit market, you find a great deal of blue prints, more found on missions and in the 'clan' dojo. Through all these methods, you can build everything in the cash shop. Granted, they are basic versions usually; but -every- frame and weapon and tool. This crafting aspect leaves only the cosmetic items as the reall pull for the shop if you are patient enough to grind out materials for your blueprints.  Is this the best game in the world? Not really; there are a hand full of glitches, the character designs are a bit odd and might take some getting used to, and the way the level systems (yes plural) work are a bit of a pain.  However, between the afforementioned crafting option, the simplicity of jumping into missions with other players and variations in mission types and goals, I can say this is a great pick up and play game.  It's free, so give it a try, you just might like it.",

It is so hard to find good free-to-play games that can be played and enjoyed without spending real money, and this is one of those gems. I haven't spend a dime on this game yet I continue to enjoy it. There are some missions which do seem insanely difficult unless you have special gear, or if you play with others. I recommend that you play this game with a group, it makes it easier and a whole lot more fun. There are a lot of missions that you can take on by yourself if you can't find anyone to play with, I replay some of them for resources and experience. Overall this game provides a fun and impressive experience considering it is free. The graphics are also pretty darn amazing. I'm running this on a low-end laptop and it still runs fine with decent graphics. I definately recommend this game.",

When i first played this game you had three warframe slots and three warframes you could choose from. The blink assassin dude, the tank, and the standard warrior warframe.  Now when i log in to play, and it's been a while since i have, all i see is paying to unlock damn near everything in the game except for maybe weapons. We've gone from having three warframe slots to 2. The only warframe you can unlock with exp (that i saw) was the tank; although you can buy warframe blueprints with in game currency (which doesn't do you much good if you dont have the slots for it). So we have warframe slots locked behind a paywall, all the other warframes locked behind a paywall. Also almost all customisation items are also locked behind a paywall.  I can not recommend this game until the warframes and warframe slots are taken from behind the pay wall.",

            "review_text": "The Game: Terribly addicting, but at least fun to compensate for it. The gameplay is reminiscent of a PvE version of Gunz: the Duel, or a Phantasy Star MMO with its combat systems kicked up several notches, insofar as players run instantiated dungeons with different mission objectives using an action-based combat system. Levels don't work at all as in either of the aforementioned games, though. Instead, a mastery rank represents the player's level of completion of game content, for which experience is gained by ranking the equipment you can make, as well as by completing mission objectives. For the most part, not bothering to increase your mastery rank beyond its natural progression has limited penalties. For example, a few items will be 'XP locked' and you will be unable to buy their blueprints or craft them. Other penalties include a limited trade count, which is equivalent to your mastery rank for every mastery rank that you are at or above 2. For those uninterested in ranking every piece of equipment, a majority of your time might probably be spent invested in endgame shenanigans, a la farming Prime weapon parts from tower runs and weapon damage maximization. The two go hand in hand, really. Since Prime weapon parts are tradeable and are often traded for Platinum (the game's premium currency), a savvy marketeer can sell whatever parts they have available and trade their platinum back into the market for different weapon parts or rare weapon mods. This eases the pain of having to grind areas for special mods, or waiting for them to show up in mission alerts.  The Community: Fine for the most part, but there does seem to be an elitist minority. Every so often, you'll see people in the recruiting channel ask for players which have achieved mastery rank 8 or higher to help with Tier 4 tower missions. It's rather disconcerting, since I can't believe that mastery level is in any way, shape, or form, related to skill after about 10 hours of playing the game.  Thoughts: While I previously used the phrase 'endgame shenanigans,' Warframe is not a game with a very well established endgame. The diversity of the equipment with which your character can be outfitted is what helps the player decide how far to go and when they want to call it quits, as there isn't much of a story to drive the action. Having achieved my own goals, I feel as though taking the time to build another powerful weapon or warframe would be redundant, as I've already gone through the experience of doing it once with the things I wanted to do it with and would probably get really bored. But I would still recommend it. If any combination of the words 'cyborg,' 'space,' and 'ninja' titillate you, then I'd say give it a shot.",

Most of the good weapons are 230+p which is going to cost you $20 with some platinum left over. You might think, 'well, that's not really terribly horrible, right?' Except, the way the damage system is built, you will totally suck against one or the other factions without buying weapons that are effective against them.  And don't give me the crap about being able to craft the weapons, because crafting resources are scattered and I've yet to unlock the systems in which to find any specific crafting materials needed. But you can buy them, for real money.  And whatever Warframe you pick at the beginning, that's the only one you'll ever have until you've unlocked enough places to gather the crafting materials, or you drop the real world cash one, which by the way is 20+ just to play another class.",

            "review_text": "I've spent quiet alot of hours in the game, mostly during the first beta back when it just came out. I quitted warframe for awhile after the release of frost prime. And have recently started playing again for a month. I spent most of my time playing this game Off-book so that's partly why I have only 43.1 hours on record. I've spent about 600 hours in Warframe according to my profile. So here's a list of PROS VS CONS.   Warframe is overall a great game, the followings are the reasons why I really enjoy it:  1. Stunning graphic: Warframe has one of the most stunning graphic in the online games I've played, and the best of all is its requirements is very forgiving (which works well for my 8 years old desktop) 2. It's free - very self-explainatory 3. They give you constant opportunities to purchase platinum (premium currency of the game) at 75% off 4. Constant updates 5. Very enjoyable for people who like PvE contents 6. Very little time consuming (for people with a packed schedule; go in do a match and go to work sort of) 7. Can be enjoyable for both the hardcore audiences and the not-so-good at games audiences 8. The Dev team cares, they do alot of Forum communications, and twitch live streams to reach out to their players  However, the game still needs improvements, and these are some of the big 'CONS' that has driven me to quit it for the second time:  1. BUGS &amp; GLITCHES - It's very hard for me to enjoy a game where there are countless bugs and glitches. I've been in the first few betas and it seems like they're not working to improve or fix these crucial glitches (ex: the launcher - bugs EVERYSINGLE time there's an update, been this way since beta) (ex#2: Ingame UI glitches - countless of instances - if you've played the game for about a week or so, you'll know what I'm saying) (ex#3: gameplay glitches - teleportation, falling into the void, freezing, 1st person, ...)  2. COMMUNITY - People hardly ever talk to each other if you run a Pug, it's like the entire community is not very vocal or trying too hard to rush games and get out as quick as possible; It really takes out all the fun there is in the game  3. LACK OF CONTENTS - One of the major reasons. Yes, they try to do events and updates every now and then, but it's not enough. Basically bringing existing gameplay and reintroducing them as an event, then adding 'PRIMED' version of existing items; those do not counted as new contents. As in after you maxed out your first frame, or set of weapons, you immediately switch to a new set and start over again, and again, and again; or go farming  4. FARMING - It's a farm-fest in warframe. I've spent more time farming than actually having fun playing this game again. Parts' droprates are ridiculous (for instance: Nova Chassis - basically it is needed for a frame and to get it, you have to play a high level survival game for rotation C rewards which is at every 20 minutes - and the droprate is just too low, It took me about a week doing that survival mission countless of time until 40 - 60 minutes every game and it was very tiring and boring to do, when most people prefer to exploit bugs to do it easier) - Wether it's gear, or credits, or blueprints you need - in the end it's all about the grind and the endless zombie-y farming.  5. CONSTANT PLATINUM SALES - Yes, I know I've listed this as one of the positives, but the ingame economy is suffering from this, since there are just way too many platinums floating around and stuff in the trading channel just get inflated  6. TRADING SYSTEM - Trading in warframe is like trading in games of the 80s - 90s, the ones I grew up with. It does not have a proper trading system, no 'OFFICIAL' standard price (just vaguely a variety for ranges - pure judgment call most of the time) - People would yell to sell their wares on the trading channel, you have to join a dojo to proceed with the transaction - Taxes ( I personally don't mind this ). Also, without an 'Official' standard price, or a median or a clear image of what the actual price for certain items, the players can literally DICTATE its value - and this opens up alot of space for SCAMMERS to roam freely.  7. WARFRAME SUPPORT - One of the worst support team, problems never get solved - as above, the launcher glitches, I've seen so many forum posts filing complaints about it, and all their solutions NEVER once worked. I had to ask people who had the same problems for help. It seems to me they really do real support stuff with platinum related issues, and transactions. Everysingle time someone try to ask for support, they will be like 'DO YOU HAVE A SCREENSHOTS, OR PROVES' - that's just bloody terrible, because I don't even know where the hell is the taking screenshot button or where the folder is located, and most people don't even bother to find out until they've been asked - some of the glitches or bugs are just their for a few seconds and they log you out or something making it even harder to actually taking a screenshots for support as proves.  8. CONNECTIVITY - Warframe lets people host their own game, which is both good &amp; bad at the same time. - GOODS: Allowing people in their local area to have better access and connectivity to their match.  - BADS: Making it close to impossible for people with limited internet connection to be able to play to others; When you host, people can't join you or lag as hell - When you join their games, you lag as hell and get disconnected constantly or their will split your game session &amp; put you in a seperated instance.  9. VERY REPETITIVE - Some of the maps and environments; They have so little amount of varities of rooms for each type of maps, making it repeating itself - making it very tiresome and boring to actually play, when there's very little left to explore. Also their map designs are very linear, nothing revolutionary or any wow factors. I bet most people playing this game literally memmorized how each map or room layout is.  10. FANS' DEMANDS / COMMERCIALIZED - I remember when I first started playing warframe, I remember the Developers - they were really passionate about this work, and they wanted it to be 'THEIR' game, which mean they want to be able to work and create whatever they want for the game, and I remember this because in one of their few first live streams they mentioned they don't want to take too many suggestions (and was being very dodgy about calling those suggestions 'not suitable' for the game); That had changed alot, since their steam launch - PS and Xbox version, as their player-counts grow. They start taking more suggestions and implementing them into the game - which to many people could be a good thing, because they're listening to their customers; But I personally look at it in a bad way, when they start to work on a game because of their financially driven mindset, it reduces its overrall quality of the game that they're trying to create (It's like hiring someone, pay them not too much or too little just enough to keep the issue of money off their table during work hours). I'd rather play a game where their Dev team is firm on their ground with their ideas and only take suggestions when there's a neccessity to make a compromise.  IN CONCLUSION: The game has been out for about 3 years, this game has alot of good selling points - one I found particularly attractive to me is its graphic effects and their free to play model. However, there are still alot of rooms for improvements. I know, some people told me the game is still in 'beta' phase, yes It is. However, It has been out for 3 years, and that beta phase pretty much has ended for me when they released the game on steam - So using that excuse for not improving some of the bugs since beta is unacceptable  Recommendations: Id recommend this for players who have a packed schedule, as they can burn through the game slowly. And a clear 'NO' for players who want a good long term experience.",

You can gain every weapon and Frame in the game without spending a dime... apart from the 2 frames that have been taken out.  You must have some ability with movement controls to enjoy combat system, people that button mash, do so because they wish to, not because there is no difference.  There is a large amount of farming but not because you cant progress. you farm for XP - Mats and frame and weapon parts. you are always getting a reward, just may not be want you want.  Paying for Plat in this game will help you gain weapons and frames faster, but not by much.. the real win for paying is the get now feature and the upgrades for said items, doubleing capacity for mods (that you also get free in game over time). you still have to get the mods as random drops or again spend cash for random mod drops.   There will be questions for anyone new to playing but every gammer knows that the 'general' chat tab is full of trolls. so join a clan or ask in missions.  Your Master Rank only levels up by leveling different frames and weapons to max. but its a good idea to always have a hard hitter with you once one is maxed out.  all in game currency  Gaining new weapon is as simple as opening the market place from your ship and click the weapons tab and the weapons blueprints tab... Primary, offhand or melee. you can make a lot of different types and more as you gain master rank. joining a clan also allows for different blueprint of frame and weapons if they are researched.  Gaining new frames is as simple as killing a planet boss enough times to collect three different peices of a warframe blueprint (BP) then buying the BP on the market place under warframes then Blueprints.  building times are long and average from 12 hours to 3 days. so feel free to build as much as you can at one time. unless you plan to use plat to speed up the build.  I have never met someone that did not want better gear, never met someone that didnt search for better gear.. the basics are easy to find and get and there are a lot of basics.  New content comes out faster than any game i have played. the Dev's are cool and funny, working with the community durring game play.  I encourage anyone that loves this game to give up a few bucks and help keep it alive. and if you do, then spend it on reactors and catalist from the market place. or open up a few more frame and weapon slots.  I hope this Helps anyone that reads it and hope to see many more years of Warframe to come.",

You can play with no limitations if you do not want to pay, infact the best weapons and mods can not be bought you have to earn/farm them. (Though you can trade with other players if you are desperate.) You cant pay to win. This game is better than a lot of AAA, $$$ first, titles on the market. I believe you will love this game and if you do, and only if you do, you should contribute. We dont work for free so i dont expect DE to either.  Fricking space ninjas. There is something truly awesome about tearing through an army of badass soldiers leaving behind severed body parts with nothing but a kitana by your side or pinning the torso of a mutated monster to the wall with a single shot from your bow.  More Fricking space ninjas. There is an ever growing roster of 20+ frames. If you want to be a tank, caster, stealth assassin, gunslinger or whatever, you have options.  There is a seemingly constant stream of new stuff happening. Every week new fixes, tweaks, patches and content is delivered.  The down side, alas there is in my opinion a downside. When I first played I did not like it. I played a public match and everyong ran off, killed everything and I was left running through empty levels. i tried to play solo and the difficulty and learnng curve was steep. However when it all started to come together, finding the right frame, mods and weapons for my style i was hooked in this ever growing universe.",

            "review_text": "Welcome to Warframe, I'm here to give you a (relatively) detailed explanation to sate the confusion you may be having about this game!  Are they mechs? or.. like. Aliens? Or. Super-Space-Ninjas? Well, to answer your question, they're all of the above!  Technically, the warframes in and of themselves are biomechanical suits which, scientifically speaking, adapt to the nuerological commands of the user in order to operate. In layman's terms, they're literally /Warframes/.  Although, at the same time, they are run by a species of Aliens called Tenno, and, well, they tend to act like Super-Space-Ninjas. Now, onto the actual review! ______  The game consists of a lot of different aspects which are very consistent with that of MMO's, although it plays a lot more like a progressive Co-Op game.   It has a crafting system which uses certain materials that you get from completing the different planet missions, which you can then use with blueprints to craft weapons, and warframes. You can craft the blueprints for weapons using the currency that you get in the game, and you can find the blueprints for warframes in specific planet missions. (Google it)  Each weapon has a different set of affinitys, and interacts with the world differently. If you want to go in guns blazing, you can use an actual gun, or a rocket-launcher, or a flak-cannon. But if you want to be quiet, you have the option to use weapons like bows, kunai, or shurikens, among other things.  There is a money-to-online-currency system that the game does optionally let you use, which you can use to either get weapons, warframes, customizations for warframes, or color-sets. (Color sets basically let you customize your warframe with different colors).  The game plays like a TPS (Third-Person-Shooter)  If you want to get into this game expecting everything to be hand-fed to you, don't play it. Like an MMO, there's a certain grinding process to getting the items or materials you want, and a certain level of luck that's involved.  I personally find it very fun.",

WF is a great third person shooter that combines the finesse of a ninja with the accuracy of a FPS game. The gameplay is great, and almost everything can be farmed with ease. Likewise, you have the option of purchasing Platinum with actual money, which can then be used to obtain cosmetics and gears. Having said that, this isn't your typical Pay2Win type of game; items and gears in WF are easily accessible if you are playing with a group of friends/ clan. The trade economy in WF is quite fair, and the community is awesome. Almost any random veteran gamer was kind enough to share tips and tricks, or even advise on gear progression. Most players are matured and understand that there is a lot info that hasn't been properly conveyed to a fresh WF gamer (a problem that I think is currently plaguing the MMO industry).   Here is where WF might deter new players entering the battlefield. The tutorial briefly touches on the game's basic mechanics, but fails to give an explanation about gear progression, syndicates, the importance of mastery rank, and how to open up new worlds/ areas in the game. The recruitment and trading interfaces might also be hard to maneuver if you are new to the game. WF is also not strong on storytelling. It puts the players in the shoes of a Tenno, but doesn't really explain the purpose of the Tenno properly. If you are looking for a compelling story, look elsewhere. Where WF really shines is in the gameplay mechanics. Each individual WF comes with 4 unique skills, which are unlocked with level progression. WF suits can be customised with mods, which will further enchance or reduce the WF abilities. If your looking for a good 3rd person shooter, look no further. WF is truly the MMO version of Mass Effect or Lost Planet.  TL;DR  Pros ====  - Great community - Constant developer updates/ streams (via twitch) - Great gameplay (wide variety of weapons and abilities) - Gear and mats are easy to obtain (grindfactor: 7/10) - Fun to play with friends or guildies - Cool WF armor designs and skins  Cons ====  - Lack of coherent storytelling - Some concepts in the game were not well explained      ",

This game takes time to learn, but if you're ready, and willing, it's worth it.   Imagine if you will, a free to play game where everything in the game is physically achievable without spending a cent, the only things that are money only, are purely cosmetic, which isn't a problem, if you're willing to spend a little cash. If not, that's fine too. Like I said, it's only cosmetic items that are paid for only.  The gameplay is quite fast paced, keeping you alert and on your toes at all times, there is no down time in a mission, the only chance you'll get to take a breather is on board your ship in between missions. The combat is centered around Primary weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, launchers, etc. Secondary weapons, such as pistols, dual wielded pistols, launchers, and side arms that utilize laser technology. Melee combat in this game, is very graphic, but very fun. You will watch your enemies literally be torn apart right in front of you, from a single slice of your blade of choice, wether it be a two-handed sword, dual daggers, hammers, axes, and whips.  The Warframes themselves, are all unique, with their own powerful abilities that have the power to turn the tides of battle with a blink of an eye. There is one for every playstyle, so it allows players to completely mold the game around them to their own playstyle. Want to be a support? go with Trinity or Equinox. You want to storm in and destroy everything in sight? go with Excalibur, Valkyr, or Rhino. Or maybe you'd rather take it slow and steady? Your best bet is Banshee, or Loki. Maybe you want to stand your ground, and stay standing after everyone before you has fallen? Frost and Vauban are the frames for you.   PROS:  -Addicting, fast paced gameplay  -Friendly community, and Clans  -Over one hundred weapons to choose from, find the one that suits you best  -Somewhat challenging aspect, but anything can be overcome if you have the right builds  -Actually free to play, no hidden paywall ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t  -Consistantly updated with new content, usually consisting of new frames, weapons, and missions to keep you busy  CONS:  -If you're opposed to farming, then you may not like this game, although, running missions is always fun, so it doesn't really feel like a hassle.  -Can be difficult to those who don't know what mods are essential, or how to build a good frame, weapon, or companion.  -Graphics aren't too system straining, but if you have an older computer you may have problems  CONCLUSION:  Great game, I highly reccomend it to anyone that is a long time fan of third person shooters, one of the best free to play games out there right now, no matter what anyone says.",

I do not plan on overviewing the mechanics, or doing much in the way of an in depth review but hey I'll say what I think matters.  First off I will say this. As I'm sure you've already read this game IS Free To Play BUT it is NOT Pay To Win. It is however pay for convenience. Every single item in this game (except for founder exclusive items Excalibur Prime and such) are attainable through regular gameplay. If you are willing to put in the time you can get anything that you desire.  Secondly there is quite a learning curve; at least there was for me. The mod system is quite in depth and many factors go into choosing an effective loadout such as the enemy type, your weapon's base damages, and many other factors. This can be a bit overwhelming but the community is wonderful and there are plenty of guides to modding weapons and warframes in the game, and if you ask a fairly experienced player I'm sure they'd love to help ya out.  Third, this is indeed a very pretty game. This is hands down the best looking Free To Play game I have ever seen, and it's even optimised well. I was able to max out the game on my overclocked GTX 650 :)  And last if you still have any questions, or need help getting started with the game, whether it is learning the in's and out's or getting the essentials in gear, just message me and I'll see what I can do :)  TL;DR Get this game it's well balanced and fair, constantly being made even BETTER, and is truly beautiful to look at.",

There are moments where I get sick of grinding for parts or mods and take a week or two long break, but then I start it up again and get right back into it. The consistancy of the updates and new material keeps you hooked, the last break I took had me start the game to a 1 gig update which added a new Prime frame (Trinity Prime) and a new base frame (Atlas) and once again I was hooked like a heroin addict, grinding away for my next hit of an Atlas part.  Pros: Great combat mechanic Balanced weapons and enemies JUST enough variety to keep you from being bored in your first 50-100 hours of play Great graphics and control set Spectacular weapons and character choices  Cons: If you're impatient you'll be wanting to spend monies on platinum to expidite your advancement Addictive Community can be a little impatient  Recommendation: Get this game. Play this game. Become an awesome space-ninja.",

TL:DR Warframe is a fun and addicting game but loses its luster after a certain period of time due to lack limited gameplay. Warframe gets a 7/10.  Pros - 1) ( Spectacular ) Visually. From the robot-like ninja Tenno to the ornate Oroking Void design/ architecture to the vast biomes and empty desolate space, Warframe nails the Sci-Fi look. The environments are ( almost )completely immersive. 2) ( Unique ) Gameplay. Since you play as space ninjas, you move as such. Various parkour movement that works, flying in space with 'jackpacks', congregating with other players to defeat bosses, collecting rare loot, hanging out with your clan mates in the clan's dojo, or even surviving hordes of malformed zombie-like creatures. It's a story/ lore influenced Third Person shooter with aspects of RTS and MMORPGs. 3) Community. By far Warframe has one of the best communities, ever. I'm a person that plays games such as CS:GO, League of legends, and Dota 2. I was amazed at how nice and helpful people are in this community. 4) Customization. In a lot of games, apart from weapon customization, there are not many things to change. In Warframe, you can customize everything from Warframe and weapons, to what specific color for each individual section upon your warframe/ weapon, VARIOUS ( hundreds ) mods and mod combinations for Warframes and weapons. What is a Mod? A Mod is an item that can be applied to your Warframe or weapon that will enhance its abilities in various ways. Wanna inflict a Poison DoT to enemies hit by your bullets? We got it. Wanna give a HP Regen to your allies? We got it. Wanna make your explosive projectiles split into multiple bullets for a multiple explosions and more damage? We got it! Wanna make your arrows pierce enemies allow collateral hits or even explode, we got it. Cons - 1) It can be a bit pricey. Depending on the person you are, you will either be spending no money or a lot. One aspect it borrows from MMORPG games is the grind. Yes, believe it or not, this third person shooter will make you grind, a hell of a lot. You get a blueprint for a weapon, you grind the materials, and you craft the item which will usually take a few mins to a few days depending on item rarity. But of course, being a Free to Play game, microtransactions is DE's income. Don't wanna grind 4 hours of your life away to get materials for Prime weapon? No worries! give us 5$ and we will feed your pocrastination. Don't wanna wait 24 hours for it? Patience is a virtue? Nonsense, give us five more dollars and you can have it now! with a side of regret. Literally ( almost ) everything in this game has a time limit or has to be grinded for. One of the biggets downsides to this game. Out of the 224 hours i've played, I'd say 75% of it is grinding. 2) Replayability. I do not know if its true, but I heard rumors that Digital Extremes performs Witchcraft. 6 months is the life expectancy of Warframe players because they die for a few weeks/ months and then magically resurrected. Apart from necromancy, DE has the ability to control the minds of players and spend their money. It is truly an addicting game for a short period of time at which you realize after grinding the same mission killing the same chopped and reskined mobs on similar maps within the limited game modes that you realize you spent way too much money and you just lost a lot of your life.  Reasons to buy - Looks nice, plays nice Reasons not to buy - Boring after a while, grind, grind, limited modes/ content, grind",

Edit 11/26/15  Not really liking the direction this game has been headed in for a year now, and the devs are stacking grind on top of grind harder than ever before. It feels very designed to push the player into buying anything newly released. We're talking garbage weapons requiring several other weapons to craft, warframe suits that take a month or more to acquire, not even counting build and research time which are (now) typically 4-7 days of waiting around. That is, unless you pay to speed it up or just outright purchase off the marketplace with real money currency.   2015 Was originally touted as the 'year of quality' where the devs planned on polishing existing content and bringing everything in line. Outside of two or three examples that were actually successful, everything they've changed has been for the worse, and 80%+ of the older weapons in the game are still complete and utter trash. The initial draw to this game for me was the unique playstyles the warframe suits bring, and the relatively diverse and unique weapons. The devs have outright killed a frame because they didn't like the way the players utilized her, and more than half remain useless or completely outclassed in every single way by other frames. This 'play the way we want you to' mentality is pretty damning and bodes ill for the future of this game.   It's also disheartening to see the devs surround themselves with 'Yes-men' in the studio and on their moderation team, with any thread on the official forums that's not positive towards the direction the game is going being locked despite polite conversation with reason given 'Trolling.' If you don't kiss ♥♥♥ your opinion isn't welcome and you're obviously trolling because how could you not love running the same missions over and over 50+ times and never seeing the part you need drop. This is not hyperbole, as datamined drop chances have confirmed suspicions that many of the more desireable items sit well under 2%.   There is no QA department; almost every single release is shipped with several bugs or breaks another part of the game completely, and any deadline is blown past shamelessly ('Just a reminder: nothing is coming this week!' - Community Manager). Every update is followed by 4-5 days of constant hotfixing as they try to bring everything they broke back to normal, be it getting stuck ingame and dying repeatedly, disconnects, inability to log in, and my favorite thats popped up this year: random bannings for no reason. Support even admits that they don't know why you were banned after you wait 2 weeks for a reply to your ticket.   It's also very clear the devs don't play their own game when they 'playtest' things seemingly for the first time on stream and load up the easiest difficulty missions available, kill some of the weakest enemies in the game, and say 'yeah this is pretty strong.' Do you walk up to level 1 bears in an MMO on your high level character and one hit them and go 'yeah, I'm strong, my class is in a good place'?  Couple all of this with the exponentially increasing grind for anything newly released (2% drop rate on new prime parts that require 5-20minutes of survival or 5-20 waves of defense to even roll for), and I have to dissuade anyone from playing this game. It's very fun with a group of friends for about 20-50 hours depending on the person, but do not think this is a labor of love. It is endless beta that has come to be more and more focused on getting its players to open their wallets. Give it a few hours and walk away. I only log on during new major updates hoping they brought back some part of the game I loved when I first started playing, but it continues to slide downhill.  Do not recommend.",

The negatives people say and argue bring the game down, are true in that some of them exist, but the fact is they just don't like the mechanic. The game has a lengthy waiting mechanic for the weapons. Its mainly just because they want people to play their game for longer periods of time. It also spreads out the distance between upgrades. This game is mostly a loot farm. If you enjoyed Diablo games, then you'd like this because its similar in that one has to grind for loot, but dissimilar in that one has to gather the materials to then make the item. It starts off slow, very slow. With determination, and if one finds the actual fighting fun. The waiting becomes not a problem. I would absolutly reccommend this game.

That aside though its a fun third person shooter mmo if you dont mind the grinding and reptitivness. One thing i hate though is Digital extremes will hide some things behind a pay wall any cool looking accessories and anything youd have to pay 20 dollars for which i dont approve of but those are the cool golden ones but you can get a regular one without paying 5 bucks or waiting for them to post a alert for the item. I mean you can expect grinding in this game but there is alot of it i mean the loot table is abysmal you can get one item your hundreth try. But besides the point its combat is great for a free to play. The gameplay is fun the missions are some what lacking most of the time its kill everyone or carry this there now defend or just stay there defend or kill these two dudes thats pretty much the mission types in a nutshell. There is however some stealth in the game Heavy enphasis because most of the time if someone joins they will not stealth at all or if you want to there is no reward and it takes 100 times longer. Also if you say well just turn it on solo or invite and play with your friends the Ai in the game is pretty bad they will cluster together making it imposible to kill them without some one who can go invisible or kill them instantly. Aswell it isnt as fun with you play with randoms cause you can get teamed up with people end game that rush ahead killing everyone instantly there is no real sense of danger when this happens so its disapointing but like said earlier you can turn it on solo or invite only and play with your friends.",

Very glad they didn't scare me off though. This game is a solid way to burn away a few hours while soothing your mind in a way only a dungeon crawler can.  A big concern people have is the grind, but I haven't really noticed it much after playing other MMO titles and, god forbid, Destiny. The grind is comparable to the grind you would find in Diablo 3 where you are just waiting for drops, but are not stuck behind an epic week long raid lockout.  Core game play is a rogue-like with semi-random generated maps, hordes, and objectives. As I play it I feel it is the perfect fusion of Destiny and Diablo 3, without Destiny's horrible loot system and raid lockouts.  I will mention that it is F2P, so there is a ton of content you can purchase to skip the 'grind,' but you are never forced to purchase. Nearly everything is unlockable through crafting and just playing the game with the exclusion of some cosmetic items.  TL;DR - Fun game, has micro transactions you aren't forced to take part in, and combines elements from two great genres (rogue-like and shooter) into one exciting package.",

Warframe is one of those games that you have to spend a long time playing to get somewhere. Whether this is constantly grinfing for blueprints or for items to sell for Platinum (One of the 2 In game currencies, this can be pirchased with real money if you wish to) it all comes down to time.   Pros: -Constantly being updated and changed. -New movement system makes the game 10x better than it was with new flips and tricks - Good graphics and visuals -Great fun to play with friends -Awesome combat flow and weapons, especially bows -Loads of missions to complete on different planets  Cons: -Can get boring as you will be repeating a whole lot of stuff -All drops are RNG based (This means Random Number Genrator, so all the drops are completely random) and you'll end up finding yourself praying to RNGeesus for the next prime part or blueprint  Overall this game is soooo much fun and is really awesome but is very time consuming and if you are impatient your money is gonna be dissapering faster then Houdini. Anyway i think this game is definitly worth downloading as it is FREE, and you may hear loads of things saying you have to pay for loads with Platinum but you don't have to buy the Platinum you can trade with others for it if you have things they want!  9/10  Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions.",

            "review_text": "Updated after Warframe Update 18.  My last review was to short and not prised the game enough. so i decided to make a full review on it.  For introductions. This is a 3rd person Action/Adventure game. Were you play as a space ninja. Many mysteries of your history is kept secret from you. You a Tenno, wake up in a solar system much like ours with some additional planets. Current status a war has broken out where one side figths to perserve, while another fights to progress. These two factions are known as the Grineer and Corpus. However there is a third faction that wants to conquer all. The Infested or Infestation. You as the playable Tenno can decide to perserve balance or pick a side, in the end all weapons are pointed at everyone regardless. Selfishly to say that its more fun and better that way.  For the game itself. On its own it too good to be a Free-To-Play. This game litteratly is the defenition of Free-To-Play. Altho the grind is hard but very rewarding. Game is highly optimised to where any old clunky computer can run it well enough to enjoy it. (I am one of said people.) This game is customizable heavy. You can pick any warframe, any weapon and set it up to your hearts content. You can even customize the color or said warframe and weapon to even add little decordive bits and skins to it. As a Free-To-Play everything is at your reach to obtain. Movement and controls are very fluint and smooth. Graphicly is to amazing to be a Free-To-Play, Brilliant colors and textures. The combat come in variaties depending on your weapon loadouts but overall combat is excellent. Nor much of a story to it but the story it has it going for isnt to shaby at all. In fact its perfect setting for the game as well as the immersion. Many mission and content thats is better shown than explained.  Altho it is Free-To-Play there is a micro-transaction system. However you can absolutly play the game fir free. No level limits, no area limits, no weapon limits, and no monthy purchases. The buying currency is called Platnium. Its mostly used to buy cosmetics and making the game progress twice a fast.  The community is absolutly helpfull. As long as you mind your P's and Q's people are happy to assist. Once again makes it unbelievable that this is a Free-To-Play. As for the developing team Digital Extremes [DE] for short. Are at nutbusting pase to always bring you new content, and wonder even if this new content is what the players want to begin with. DE is always puting the player first rather than there wallets. Weekly hotfixes and patches. Everyso often a game changing update that blows minds and gives the player another warframe fix to get addicted on.  Pros of Warframe. [+] Free-To-Win by beyond generouse defenition [+] Constant pacthes and updates [+] Tight but happy Community [+] The choice to play alone or with others. [+] Verioty of Combat [+] Content plue end game Content. [+] Craftable goods and weapons. [+] A plethera of Warframes and Weapons to chose from. [+] Warframe and weapons are upggradable through modifications. (Also completly free) [+] Unique different playstiles to chose [+] Many explorations as well as random generated level desing. (Rouge like almost) [+] Intersingt story, enemies, bosses, and assasins. [+] Simple to learn, Complex to explain.  Cons of Warframe [-] Grind heavy, but not as bad as Destiney because here is very rewarding. [-] Time consuming crafting. Making a new Warframe, Weapon, or Goods. Can last about 12 hours to 3 days. [-] A small window of exclusivity. More of my own personal Con than a overall. Its only a small window and the exclusives arent always the best. Just look better.  My perfetional opinion rating would be a 9/10 My totaly biast opinion rating is 10/10 Portable Orokin Technical Augmentaion Tactical Offensive.  POTATO for short.  Personal notes:  The game is a bit of a slow burn at first. Mainly all you have to soak in. However once you learned something once your ok for the rest of the game. Even though this game can be grind heavy that dosent make it a bad thing. I personaly like grinding if the grind is rewarding in some ways. I personaly tossed money in, but not because its required. Mostly because it deserves the money. I'm more than happy to invest into this game. There is plenty to do. im already over 1000 hours into the game and only fell i got another 3/4 to go before im through. Even so with new stuff keep getting pumped out i doubt ill ever retire from this game in the next 5 years. Even then i still have doubt i could even retire. This game is oddly satisfing in many ways.   Anyways thank you for reading my review. there prolly were some shorter version out there, but i hope you enjoy. This game is too good to be true for a Free-To-Play.",

Some good customisations for weapons.  **Updated review** Seeing as how I wrote my first review a long time ago, I figured it would reinstall and give it another shot and update.   It is fun for awhile, but VERY repeatative. There is virtually no story to this game. Bits and pieces of lore are sprinkled around, but nothing substantial.   -You are a good guy (or bad guy, we still dont really know) -1 of 3 factions are in a world and try to stop you from your objective (Rescue hostage, access computer/get data, carry briefcase to terminal/defend a few times, Endless defense, eliminate all enemies), then you run to a finish line -You get a pet to help you, either a robot or a dog, but you gotta farm for it -Collection game, gotta get all those cards to upgrade your weapons and armor. Dont forget about the micromanagement of said cards, gotta wade through TONS of duplicates to merge and upgrade the ccards themselves -All armor requires a fairly lengthy grind due to RNG -Sometimes a deadly boss appears randomly to 'avenge' someone else you killed -At any given time, theres really only 2-3 good weapons you should be using. Everything else is just a leveling grind to up your account level for bonuses  It looks good, especially at high settings. But it gets boring. You are mindlessly killing enemies without really knowing more than they are in the way. You can co-op with 3 other players for missions, but really you need to speed run to keep up with them. Dash to objective, complete, run to exit. Repeat  If you are looking to kill a weekend, by all means give it a shot. Long term, you will be burnt out on this never ending beta.",

I have not encountered many bugs and the game gets regular updates so if there are bugs they will be fixed. The game also looks good. Great lighting and visuals through out all of the planets.  The cons for the game are: If you want to have fun, i recomend playing with 3 other people with skype. The in game voice chat is really bad. If you dont want to pay 60 bucks up front the game takes time, and i mean alot of time, to get the warframes and tools you want.   Other then that its a pretty good game!

Warframes are all so creative beautiful and unique and it never feels quite boring to play with them, the normal versions are also grindy to get and each component has to build 12 ♥♥♥♥ing hours and the warframe itself takes 3 days to craft once you've started the process. New warframes will need a new alert (daily missions) only resource called nitain extract to farm which is soo bad to get for newer players who just want to vary their playstyle and do something fun in the game not saying excalibur isn't fun, but he is no mirage who makes booby traps and disco balls of death. But even though it sounds like a terrible amount of grinding, weapons and warframes are quite rewarding, especially for first-time players who just got an interesting warframe like valkyr or chroma. And now for the primes, OH MY GOD, I HATE FARMING FOR PRIMES! they are special variations of the normal warframes featuring higher stats and polarities (let's put a pin on this one), the are visually stunning either black and gold or white and gold (depends on how you see the dress), they might have special particle effects and you are generally a pretty kool dude if you have one, but it takes time and a lot of praying for RNGesus to spray you with glorious prime part component blueprints for either warframes and blueprints, you'll have to play certain void missions to get a chance at the prime part blueprint you want and trust me, it feels SO GOOD when you get them. there are a few prime warframes in the game currently and you can buy one in the current pack they are offering, which is the latest prime released, then they'll withdraw the pack to introduce the new prime and make a new pack (note these cost a lot of real money), these also generally come with new weapons (primed) and cosmetics for you and your pet, the kubrow (doggy) or sentinel (space robot worms that fky and break your stealth game, except for shade, i love you shade :3)  The pet system is amazing, because you have different sentinels and breeds of kubrow, each specialising in something that helps in battle, and they are adding new pets which are the kavats (my own space kitty, yay), but you have to craft sentinels, by getting their resources, primed sentinels which are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get, you know, the recurring torturous farming, grinding and temptation to buy platinum which is stupidly overpriced but makes the game so easy to muddle through)  Platinum.... ♥♥♥♥ you platinum, it's expensive but a not a necessity, one of the giant benefits in warframe that is very good and convenient but not needed to make the game fun, it's no Pay to Win game, it's a new type called grind and bullet jump to win, not like some games that literally ask to get prmium memberships and buy premium currency or else you'll be stuck with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff forever, which in turn makes the game annoying and not fun, which is sub-optimal for a game, but warframe is free to play and not P2W, so platinum is there to make the game easier for you to play and make the game easier for the devs to make and they actually deserve the time and money some people put in this game, because honestly it's amazing and is constantly evolving (except for the AI of the enemies, seriously DE, fix that ♥♥♥♥!), and they are very in touch with their community and knows how to make everyone ride the hype train, they make anything sound awesome. They stream every week with the devs and the amazing community manager and space momma, DERebecca (she voices the lotus).  So all in all, warframe does have some flaws but they have over 18 updates so far, U18 being my favourite, they introduce new elements, renew old ones, substitute outdated and impossible to salvage things like your warframe abilities counting as mods and taking mod capacity, thank god they took it out. Finally they are amazing people at DE the community is amazing and full of hate and everyone bashing about how saryn is not OP anymore but instead is more dynamic and rewarding to use, so 8/10 objectively and 2000000000000000/10 for me, if you disagree......              ♥♥♥♥ YOU!!!! :3",

The graphics are of a interesting realistic quality. You play as a space ninja where there are many different 'warframes' each with unique stats and abilities. Getting into the more dynamic parts of the game may take a bit but it's well worth with a variety of missions to choice from and a map theme to go with the planet you are on. It's even more fun with friends as well as a lot easier in most cases, but you can most definitly solo to a degree. Personally I use a x360 controller, so if your like me, you will have lots of fun :D. It is free-to-play but you will have to make a profile and install the came and update as they are activily working on the game!   tl;dr: 'realistic'/high quality graphics, you are a space ninja with super powers. hard early, grindy late, requires second profile and updates.",

And it's undeniable, there are some really big names out there which give this particular part of the industry a pretty bad name. When done right though, it can be the poor mans way to gaming.   Warframe is a game that does this better than many others. First off, Platinum(the games special currency) can be used for these following purpouses:  -Speed up crafting -Buying weapons and warframes instantly withough having to get the materials -Buying cosmetics -Trading with other players -Buying slots for warframes and weapons  None of these provide an unfair advantage in the end. Players have the same potential for being good at the game no matter how much or little they pay. They simply cut down on grinding and waiting. Also the only purchase you'll ever need to make is more slots which are super cheap anyway. Note the fact that you can trade it with other players. This of course means you can earn Platinum without paying a cent as long as you know what to do.   But what about the game itself then? Well...  Warframe is an action-RPG shooter hybrid where you play as magical space ninjas with sparkly superpowers. The sole purpouse of the game is to shoot stuff so that you can get resources and blueprints so you can shoot stuff harder and get more resources and blueprints. You also have a quite robust parkour system at your disposal. It's not quite Mirrors Edge but it works and it brings alot more style and excitement to battles.   The game revolves around crafting and buying new warframes and weapons. Weapons can be all different kinds of rifles, launchers, laser miniguns etc. while melee weapons range from dinky knives to greatswords bigger than its user. Warframes on the other hand are basically different characters. Each warframe has a set of stats and four abilities.  Pros: -Parkour system is fun and makes the game feel uique from other shooters -Lots of lore to explore for those who are interested -Always satisfying to try out a new frame or weapon -Good f2p model -Tons of gameplay hours to be lost here -Generally polite and helpful community. Of course a-holes are to be expected here and there  Cons: -Grinding can sometimes get tedious if RNGsus is not on your side -Trade system could be better -Some things take way too long to get *cough* Equinox *cough* -Some weapons and frames are not worth the work to get them -Might be hard to know how to start out. Try to get help from someone more experienced if you find yourself not knowing what to do",

For a free-to-play user, the combat may become a bit repetitive, but for a paying player, there are many weapons to choose from, which keeps the game exciting and fast-paced. Warframe does a wonderful job at getting increasingly difficult through the stages. My only complaint about this game is the map, the atmosphere within each level eventually all begins to look the same, it is hard to tell at some points if you have already done a level or not. Regardless of this, I still highly recommend the game to everyone who enjoys a fun, combat-based game.",

You don't have to pay for anything if you don't want to which is a nice touch, yes there is a bit of real time waiting for when constructing something (12 hours for a weapon, 72 hours for a Frame) but its worth the wait. there are only a few things here and there which you would have to dig into your wallet to buy, but those things are justified, otherwise they are really hard to find/farm for. Speaking of which, the Farming/Grinding for specific blueprints or materials is way more fun then in other games as you'll more likely than not come up with other intriguing rewards, they may not be what you're looking for, but almost everything that you can find has a use.  The one teeny tiny problem I have is with a little bit of the voice acting. mainly with Lotus. Now don't get me wrong She's beautifully designed, the one thing she's lacking in my opinion is any real emotion, but I guess that is kinda explained in one of the stories (Second Dream). Second Dream was a great story speaking of which, however (without any spoilers) I can honestly say that I was mind blown, but after a while in the end a little dissapointed but thinking back on it I still like the ending because it still leaves some questions/secrets which I hope will be answered soon. I can't say what specifically disappointed me about it without spoiling a huge lore secret so I'll just leave it at that. However, that out of the way, Second Dream was all in all pretty damn epic.  OH MAN!!! I almost forgot something else that's really well thought out about this game. The extra (DLC like) stories (or episodes) are completely free! you just have to rank up, buy the blueprint for the specific episode and craft it.  I can't wait to see what else is to be done with this game, and believe me if I could make 3D models I would be designing helmets for a lot of the Frames (IVARA IS LACKING A LOT OF HELMETS!!!)",

Here are some factors that led me to my mad addiction:   ~Through farming (How rigorous depends on the rng gods) you can buy pretty much anything with the in game with the 'money-costing' currency (Platinum) with the trading system allowing for the trade of parts/upgrades for platinum.  ~The Graphics are AMAZING for a free to play game!  ~Sounds are nice, new updated sounds are soon to be released. ~Many many frames(classes essentially) available, allowing for a diverse gameplay.  ~The crazy amount of builds that can be experimented with given the ample amounts of mods in-game. ~There feels like an endless amount of missions, as completing planets opens up more planets. On top of that there are special areas that contain specialized missions with specialized rewards from a specific loot table. (A very special place, as you can tell)  Cons:  ~Lots and lots and lots of gridning.....but this is counteracted by the vast amount of frames and weapon combinations, allowing for a more diversified gridning experience.  ~Certain builds are preferred by other players more than just a random build, making recruiting for a mission a bit tedious if you're running with an uncommon or made-up build.      TLDR; Great game, would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an in-depth, interactive mmo-rpg-fps-3rd person game.",

I've probably spent more than I should have on this game for cosmetics or items that I didn't feel like grinding for, but at no point did it feel like a rip-off or that I 'had' to spend cash.  Each frame (think of a character class) feels unique and dynamically alters the way you play, and each are viable and uniquely suited for a given situation. After you get past the clunky tutorial, the missions flow easily - you can solo most missions if you feel like exploring and opening every single loot cache. . . or you can find other players fairly quickly to tackle the harder missions. Mastery ranks encourage players to try new things and keep their experience fresh, but the forma mechanic also allows you to keep any item you enjoy viable at all levels of play.  I'm a little ashamed of the time I spent playing this, but let that be testament to its replay value. I normally burn out on games much faster.",

These goals may be certain quests and small (what i like to call) Candy Treats that give you a sort of high whenever you accomplish something that you wanted to. Even building a new semi-automatic rifle is a pleasure, because you get a new goal to make them better, stronger, and find what works, and though this may seem boring, this game actually gives you a sense of pleasure by watching yourself start weak and become strong. The crafting system is what gives the game a sense of Candy Treats because it gives you breaks inbetween the game so whenever you come back, you have something new to use and it is not the same as always. There is a high degree of costumization, and though it is hard to obtain, it is obtainable just from playing the game enough. It perfectly balances out time spent grinding, and time spent earning, and focuses more on the FUN of what a game should be, rather on the difficult challenge some games tend to exadurate thinking impossible quests are fun. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a fun game to waste a ton of time on, and I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves beauty of design and story and costumization.",

That said, I REALLY love this game. I have to say that was probably the fastest I've ever had a bug/hack fix taken care of!!!!",

There was a point where I had about 99% of all items in the game, missing only exclusives and 2 boss-dropped guns (RNG for the lose). So I know what I'm talking about. Warframe goes through the standard MMO cycle; Release OP thing, profit, nerf thing, release exclusives, profit, repeat forever - printing money. Gammacor being a good example. And don't get me started on the horrible development cycle and spam of compile errors, but they managed to hold it together with glue and tape. This is almost the only game making them any money at all so I see why theyre milking it so hard. But frankly it's a giant negative for the game, and its likely to, and indeed should, turn off new players.   If you can play responsibly, and not throw money at the game, then it's great.

The quality that the developers have put in to the combat systems, the visuals, and just the gameplay style in general is way beyond a lot of newer games that you have to pay to play. ** COUGH COUGH *  DESTINY  * COUGH *. In this game, as you grind for resources to craft weapons, new frames, and other things, you find yourself getting hooked on the whole batshit-crazy ninja mechanics where's you're jumping off walls and murdering enemies simultaneously. I've seriously never experienced a more enternaining combat system that has been executed so perfectly. You'll find that not only are the gameplay mechanics extreemly fun, but generally, the atmospheres are really well established with very simple techniques, for example, when you're about to fight off some infected, you'll find that the area is dark, dirty, and just straight ominous looking. It's crazy to see such a well-detailed game be free to play.  all in all, if you're looking to become a futuristic, interstellar space ninja, fighting along-side your interstellar space ninja friends and ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up, look no further.",

No problem (Except for effing Vauban)(and legacy Prime frames) + Wanna battle creatures and have some sort of a backstory + some form of a story line? No problem + The game has amazing visuals for a free to play + You can access everything fast through in game currency, but that is not necessary as you can acquire everything by completing missions + You can join Clans, many of whom have completed all of the avaliable research and thus you can acquire items, whose components you can't find through missions + Overall my personal favourite free to play with constant updates coming out, the devs have turned this rock into a marvelous gem, that only gets better + The gameplay itself is awesome, the Tenno are responsive to commands and are easy to manouver.  Cons -  - Grindfest lord - you can obtain everything in the game, but you will spend DAYS to acquire that ONE LAST component you need for an item - The RNGezus tends to be a ♥♥♥♥ - Occasional bug here and there, I once stuck in a wall during a mission, sometimes the frame doesn't go where you want to - You might grow bored of the grinding after a while - If you get into Warframe, you don't get out... you WILL come back, there is no escape - Stalker will ♥♥♥♥ you up, so prepare your ♥♥♥ during early levels  Overall, great game, 250hrs and I am still a noob, but atleast I have Rhino prime, so suck it.

And updates containing more to hunt down. It's also worth noting that its' community market's economy is pretty well balanced and even addictive.   Anyways. It's fun at first. Very fun. But quickly becomes rinse and repeat grinding. Some games do that well, but Warframe is a different story. It's core is too confused and a myriad of poor balancing from weapons to the Warframes themselves which make a portion of playstyles frustratingly inneffective. It's a viscious circle. You get the tools to be a slick ninja, but it's balanced around the fact that anyone can pick up a grenade launcher and blow the hoards away, or pick a Warframe that makes things trivial with the press of a button.  Two things need to happen to make this game a total must play. - An AI overhaul. (They don't even try to dodge your aim.)  - Severe weapon and Warframe rebalancing.   Because right now, the game only gets harder with numbers and caking on more health/damage. It doesn't get smarter or faster. Dial back the quanity for quality, and this will be as awesome as it seemed when I first picked it up.",

I've gone through the steps of grinding out blueprints for a new Warframe and then grinding out the material, and it feels good to finally put on that new Warframe and try it out. I also just like tedious grinding, so I guess that spoke to me on a personal level.   Wish the PvP wasn't dead, though.  Good game, try it out. Strong 8 out of 10.",

EDIT: I recently came back to the game to play for a bit and i couldnt get into the grind with other people because i wasnt using some meta setups or because i didnt have 2 DAMN HOURS to help people grind for 1 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ item. i stopped right after because without other people its difficult to survive the missions you need to grind but when i had people doing this left and right it just killed it right there for me. so if that isnt a good analogy for the grinding of this game idk what is.",

The main point is getting mods to make your warframe stronger and crafting stronger mods with other mods and i guess getting a cooler looking warframe but i can't really see myself grinding long enough to do that however i havent unlocked the 'lacross but with aliens' part of the game yet so i will probably play for another few days atleast.

The frames are very numerous and quite diverse and DE is constantly bringing out new frames and equipment. The stories continue to be upgraded and the community is overall very friendly.   This is a game of grinding to build your own ecosystem of sorts. If you are not into such games, Warframe will not interest you. However, if you do like leveling up your equipment, interacting with other players and creating a place for yourself, Warframe is a wonderful place to do so.   Oh and one final word. I have never 'Had to' pay for anything in the game. The only time I did was to give something back to DE by buying Pt during a 75% off deal (I already had thousands of Pt but did so anyway), or to buy Tennogen products.

So much to unlock and achieve still.   Pros : -Space Ninjas -Space Ninjas doing parkour -Massive crafting system -Massive research system -Dynamic builds. Meaning, you can customize and mod a Warframe that suits your play style, the way you want it, and if you do it right, it will be competitive. There are so many Warframes with so many abilities and so many weapons gears and modifications, that truely everyone is catered for.  -Interesting and involving quests and quest lines to discover and complete, spanning over multiple planetary systems. -Space Ninjas in space, with almost robotech type suit. Called archwings.  *-Very addictive  Cons : -Waiting walls. There will be times where you have nothing to do but wait for completion of a foundry project. Which time you could do something else or farm resources by repeating previous missions. -It is free to play, not pay 2 win, but the line is very thin, as you can buy just about everything through in-game means, but it will take you very long. -Game is very confusing at start. You will find yourself bashing your head with frustration through the first few days. Things are ill explained, and community is like ' Well, you should have known that. We do, since we been playing for so long' etc. No real helpful guides. You just have to push through and learn everything the hard way. *-Very addictive   Those are the big things that stand out for me personally. Definitely worth it though. I have managed to not only survive the first few days, but have managed to build a Dojo with all research structures and a lot of research, I have built 8 Warframes and 30 odd weapons. Done it all without having to pay. Just by trading in-game. I'm not even a power gamer. So jump in and get good, as that's all it takes to enjoy this awesome game.",

        {
            "review_text": "Edit: Now that I have put a lot of time into this game I hit the 'farming point'. What I mean by that is I have unlocked all the planets, completed the main story line quest, and obtained most of the warframes you can get from bosses and grinding the same mission types over and over. When you get to this point the game just becomes a relic, vault, and void fissure grinding experience. It turns into this experience because to get 'prime' gear you literally have to run the same missions over and over to get relics. Then you have to take said relics and run the same missions types over and over to open them. The catch is that you have a slim chance of receiving the gear item you want from the relic, vault, or void fissure you are grinding. When you run void fissure missions you are given a chance at six different items from just that one relic. Even when you spend hours running void fissure missions to collect void traces to refine your relics its seems to help very little in terms of getting the exact prime item you need. I have run void fissure missions 50+ times with a refined relics and not gotten the item I needed (takes about an hour of grinding void fissure missions just to get enough traces to refine one relic). All this grinding doesnt even include the other materials you must grind to build said prime items after you have collected each piece. This style of game play is pretty much all that you experience once you have reached the end game content. Overall this game is excellent for the first 40 hours or so of gameplay but dies rather quickly when you get to the end game. Since end game content is a key feature for me in any MMO, I have to change my recommendation to 'no'.   8/10 for first 40 hours of gameplay  2/10 for end game content     This is a recommendation but it has some heavy undertones and issues that I am assuming will be fixed. If the below issues are not fixed then this would be a non recommendation.  Backround: I have only started playing this game since the new patch has been out. So I have no bias based on how the game use to be and how it is now. After reading the recent reviews I can tell that the way the game is now is worst off then it was before.   Problems: Simply no other way to put this other then you need friends with all the planets unlocked to even remotely progress as a new player. You will need crafting materials that can only be obtained on planets that you cant even unlock yet in order to unlock that hyper gate to said planet..... I think when they developed this patch they did not connect all the dots or test if a new player could advance off the first two planets on his own.   The second problem is arch wing missions. These are flying missions in the game and specifically they have timed ones that you must fly threw a very poorly designed level with very poor map icon indicators. Essentially you are flying through a randomly computer generated maze and 99% of the time it doesnt flow right. I have yet to beat a single one of these mission types. The patch notes say they fixed archwing flying mechanics but they still feel broken to me.   The good stuff: Game play is fun All the different moves and mods you can get keep the game intresting  It isnt a pay to win game its a pay to not wait which if your patient its a plus versus the pay to win system Everything in the game can be obtained by crafting and not paying real money (again have to wait for the items to build, you can pay real money to not wait) Fast flow missions, you can do a bunch of missions quickly or you can take your time. This is a bonus for me because some types are boring and you just want to knock them out fast.  Graphics are great on a good machine (Never tried on a low end machine but on a high end one it plays great) Multiple different warframe builds to play multiple different roles on a map. If you like chopping stuff then you can chop stuff, if you like shooting stuff you can shoot it, if you like blowing stuff up you can blow stuff up, if you like being a ninja and sneaking around then be a ninja.   Overall I like the game a lot but the not being able to advance past certain planets with out materials you cant obtain as a new player is going to drive you mad if you dont have friends that play. This seems like something they will clearly fix because it doesnt seem like they purposely designed it that way. Only time will tell where they take the game next.",

I started playing Warframe in 2015 after a friend showed me the game, i can say after almost 700 hours that this is the best free to play game currently on the market, DE have really done well, especially in making this game non pay to win which many other games promote and actively encourage *cough* Call of Duty *cough*.  Regarding my gpu the game often crashes on mission end and i can only load the missions if im not in the warframe window, but by no means does that ruin the fun of this game, the replaybility is endless no matter how many times you have to grind for a certain prime item, no two missions are the same, even boss fights.  Every Frame is unique and offers alternative playstyles for every player, even if they are not that good (hydroid), most frames are available by simply farming bosses, others can be get from quests, alerts and sorties, might aswell mention that my favourite frame is Nova Prime, but as i was saying every frame offers unique gameplay, unlike me though i reccomend playing every frame before you choose a favourite.  As for missions there are a huge variety of missions and map nodes to play (love the new starchart btw, also RIP Draco) there are lots of unique tilesets and due to the level being proceduly generated on every load up hardly any two levels are the same, the quests are also really fun and have interesting stories (War within hype).

            "review_text": "This game is simply a masterpiece, and a work of videogame art at its finest.  If there truly is anything from Warframe that needs to be mentioned, it's the phenomenal and optimized performance of this game on almost any hardware, including integrated graphics cards that aren't dedicated nor meant for gaming.  For one thing, this game's minimum system requirements are enough to get you interested immediately. It only requires two gigabytes of memory. Yes, two. Considering that the average memory today is thought to be eight, the requirement of only two for this game is almost too hard to believe, but it's true.  More so, the graphics card this game requires can have as little as half a gigabyte, not to mention this game only requires a dual core processor with two gigahertz that's ten years old. Even with those specifications, it's likely that you could still play Warframe at medium settings with a steady thirty to forty five frames per second, and that is impressive.  If the requirements still aren't enough to make you download this game, the visuals are very impressive in comparison to the hardware that this game requires. Considering how little power the minimum required hardware actually offers in comparison to modern day gaming hardware, the visuals far exceeded my expectations.  As a matter of fact, while I was in game, I even noticed that, while I had my framerate display visible, it showed that the game was still using up less than a single gigabyte of memory, even while you're in heavy fighting. Because of this low memory usage, lag spikes are essentially non existent for anyone who has at least four gigabytes of memory, even if you choose to play on maximum settings.  And finally, to top it all off, I have experienced very few issues or crashes while playing Warframe. During my time in missions, for me, bugs are almost non existent, all the while I have experienced, quite literally, only a few crashes over the course of six months since I downloaded this game.  As for the sound effects and music, many consider Warframe's soundtrack to be an underrated and hidden gem of the current generation of videogame music and sound, and I completely agree. What's even more delightful is that the voice acting is actually quite good, along with the actual quality and clarity of the sound effects.  What's even more tempting in a technical aspect is the incredibely expansive and wide variety of display and audio settings to change, many of which are unavailable to change in other games through conventional means. In short, Warframe is a rare gem that will easily attract the attention of those who enjoy technical customization.  To finally give you an idea of just how superb Warframe's performance really is, I am currently using hardware that would've been considered acceptable for a heavy gaming setup at least five years ago. The graphics card I use is at least five years old, and has roughly a third to a fourth of the memory that most people would have for a gaming setup. More so, my memory is at least half of what most people would have today, not to mention both it and my processor could be considered up to ten years old.  And yet, even with hardware that aged, I still manage to play Warframe on its maximum display settings, all the while maintaining a minimum framerate of at least thirty, even during an extremely heavy fight with three other people doing the same alongside me, and at times, even exceeding sixty. A game with that type of superb performance, combined with visuals that, at maximum, were considered impressive for the year it was released, is a very rare gem to find, and does not come often.  After all that I have said about the game, it should be more that enough to tempt anyone into downloading this free gem of shining beauty into their library. Warframe is nothing short of a work of art, and those who first developed the game should be very proud of themselves, because, in a technical aspect, they have done what very few games in the current decade have managed to do, if any at all. I can only begin to hope that other game developers learn from what Warframe's developers have done, and follow their example.  With all of this said and done, this is the perfect next gen and intensive game for anyone who is on a budget, including myself. If your computer's hardware is no more than ten years old, then it will play Warframe. Even if that means you have to lower your display settings, you will still get a playable framerate that is considered acceptable and average by most gamers, many of which would say thirty.  ",

I was playing this since the closed beta and they've come a long way since the days of one gray spaceship hallway after another. The game is huge, varied, colorful and chaotic.   While it is true that you can get every weapon and possibly every warframe for free just by playing. Don't know if this is still true but back 2 years ago you could build the warframe by collecting parts in the more difficult planets. The slots you have to open up to hold them in your inventory though, take real money. Also, you have to griiiiind in this game. It could potentially take you hours a day just to get enough of one item so you can build what you need. That means doing the same mission, doing the same thing over and over and over again. In a way this is a casual game but in another way it isn't.  You have to be willing to commit your time and money to this game if you want all the weapons and warframes. If you aren't a grinder type of player and don't have the money to spend on inventory slots, you can still have fun with this game for a little while but then there will eventually be that threshold where you have to decide. How far do you want to dive in? For me, I spent about $40 from the start to when I stopped playing and got over 400 hours of game time that I really enjoyed. The grind got to me though and I was unwilling to spend anymore money on slots.   This is one of the best co-op games out today. It's massive! the shooting feels nice. I've never had any problems with the community. Flipping, running along walls and sliding around like a badass ninja feels great! There's just that one problem of commitment. How much time and money are you willing to spend? At least give this a try since it's free to start out and see if you like it. I'm sure you'll get plenty of hours of fun out of Warframe.",

After you finished crafting the weapon/warframe, gongratulations you now have a new weapon.. Btw. The only way to lvl up in this game is to first level up your warframe/weapon. And for that you will once again have to farm so that you can craft a new weapon..  Warframe consists of endless farming, which can get really boring after a while as Warframe never really gets anything new to the gameplay (except warframes and weapons.)

Controls are nice, graphics are flashy, the soundtrack is appropriate and let's face it, you're a space-ninja. Buuuuuut, that doesn't mean bugframe doesn't have cons. With every update you have to wait for a couple of hotfixes, cause of certain bugs that keep reappearing, it's a tough start for a new player (but it's like that for any MMO), the RNG is terrible, some changes that come with updates, the so-called nerfs, are usually uncalled for.  Still it's F2P and if you play well enough (or if RNGesus blesses you with multiples of rare stuff), there's a trading system, so you can sell the rare stuff you don't need to lazy players with platinum ($€-bought in-game money) for that said platinum. All-in-all it's a game you need to play a bit to figure out if you like it or not.   My new review:     I stopped playing the game. Not because of any gamebraking factor, or any major change. It's because everything feels the same. Sure the quests are a nice change of pace from regular missions,  BUT  EVERY NEW WARFRAME, EVERY NEW WEAPON (well not every weapon since most of them are craftable through market), EVERY NEW WHATEVER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT YOU NEED, YOU GOTTA FARM IT FROM BASIC MISSIONS OR a bit different version OF THE SAME BASIC MISSIONS, for which you ALWAYS EQUIP THE SAME SETS and JUST MOSTLY CAMP OR DO A SPEEDRUN OF THE MISSION TO GET WHAT YOU NEED AND THEN YOU RINSE AND REPEAT UNTIL YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT!!! And while we're on the topic of new stuff... They have a tendency to nerf every single thing in the game... Except enemies, which get a buff every once in a while... The community is still decent, well it is getting a bit cancerous, but that comes with every big F2P game. Also one more thing that is with most if not all F2P M.M.O. games, the EULA contains them being able to ban you for whatever reason they want to. I don't mind that part, I mind when they ban people who just comment on what wasn't fixed and what should be fixed with updates cause something is broken in-game.   ",

            "review_text": "(I know i do not have much time on this game but this is merely my opinion from my experience so far)  I mostly recommend this game if you have a bit of spare money that you are willing to spend on a game. Because if you do have a bit of spare cash, this game will be incredibly fun in some ways, since almost everything can be bought with platinum, which is this games currency from micro-transactions. The amount of cool things i've seen from people who have spents lots of money on this game, is unrealistic. It makes me feel like a less cool space ninja guy, but meh, i'd rather spend my money elsewhere.  If you are like me and dont want to or have any money to spend on a game, this game can still be somewhat addictive to some extent. I first heard about this game when it came close to being one of the top mmo's where you need to farm like crazy, and boy was that list right. I spent a whole 24 hours just farming for neurodes, which is a crafting component for many weapons. I only got about 4-6 within that time. Whereas a friend of mine got around 50 within a couple of hours. So i just guess that my RNG is bad.   I kept on saying to myself whilst farming 'Why am i still doing this? How can i do this for so long?' The thing that made me stick, is the variety of 'tactics' you could use. Now i quoted that because many people would disagree and say this game isnt tactical at all. And i also somewhat agree, as i've seen people stand still as trinity and any other warframe, and just spam abilities. And that doesn't look fun at all, nor tactical.  In conclusion:  If you have some spare money in your steam or paypal then you will more than likely enjoy this game and play it for hours on end.  If you want to play this game and not put any money into it, you will need alot of spare time and patience to get to the point where you will enjoy it the same as those who have put money into this.  I'd give this game a 8.5/10 if i were to give it a legitimate rating. This game could be perfect, but my personal RNG is whats making me not enjoy this game at all, and the fact that people who put money into this can have a much more overpowered things in a much smaller time frame, but heck, i guess thats how micro-transactions work.",

For some, its grinding the void to get all the prime weapons and frames. Others want to set records and see how far they can go in a survival or defense mission. And of course Fashionframe is the true endgame.   Every frame and weapons truly feels unique and you will have countless hours of fun trying out new builds to fit your playstyle.   On the topic of the in game market. PLatinum is the premium paid for currency used to buy weapons and frames from the market. However, everything except cosmetic items can be obtained without spending any real cash. Some games have this model as well but with an absolute ridiculous odds and actually being able to collect everything you want unless you pay for it. You will never feel that way in warframe. With relative ease and alot of fun doing it will collect blueprints and parts and build different frames and weapons in your foundry. The best part about it all? If you grind out the rare prime parts from the void, other players will be willing to buy them from you for platinum which in turn can be used to buy things from the market. If anything, Warframe is pay to speed up and most certainly NOT pay to win.   The Developers (DE) give constant updates and balances, and are in frequent contact with us. Between Dev Streams and ingame messages about hotfixes, I can easily say that DE are probably the best developers at listening to their fanbase and responding to them.   Give warframe a try, its free and a ton of fun.",

This was the first game that i downloaded to my computer almost 2 years ago when I got into PC gaming. Needless to say, the game has DRASTICALLY changed since then. However, it's still amazingly fun.  People usually describe warframe as a grind (which it is). It's a different kind of grind though. All the weapons and warframes have a purpose (with like maybe 2 exceptions), and are just fun to use. Thats it. This is just a fun game that i literally am stuck playing because it's jsut freaking fun to fly around like a ninja chopping enemies in half and sending them ragdolling into oblivion with a grenade launcher.  Get it, try it out, it's free afterall. If you dont like it, oh well, you didnt loose any money.  EDIT:  GG DE, ya got me with the 2, 75% off of platinum purchases in a row. Guess who has 8k plat sitting around, and nothing to spend it on.  Thats the problem that ive run into after an almost 300 additional hours since i wrote the first review, is that im starting to run out of shinnies, and the new shinnies arent really that interesting to me. The newest weapons like the stradavar and dark split thingies are trash and a waste of time. The devs need to spend less time making copycat 'trap' weapons that suck, and make more interesting unique weapons that could serve a purpose. I need something to use that can take out the lvl 120 enemies i face on a regular basis BESIDES the tonkor or synoid simulor or vaykor hek.  Recent reworks to warframes like Saryn and Mag (Volt is excluded, his was good) have blow a huge load. Thats all i have to say. Still would reccommend this game despite the gripes.",

Yes, there's a hell of a lot of stuff that requires some pocket money but there's also a lot of stuff that you can earn yourself and I feel like you won't be hampered too much unless you find cosmetic looks insulting to your character. This game has fantastic fluidity in it's movement and combat systems (with the right movement combo you can genuinely go 0-100mph real quick). The game is graphically awesome and is well optimised in various areas, all of these options are changeable to your own spec ofcourse.   Warframe is a very nice switch up from the regular fast paced action MMOShooter and I truly believe and stand by the fact that if you played this game before the huge update it has had and stopped playing since, give it another go now. Honestly, I'm thoroughly impressed with the direction this game is taking. Do not be turned away by the microtransactions as like I said, a lot of these items are available through Mastery Rank and using blueprints to collect the resources you need to make them.  Pros: - Great storyline so far - Character design and background is very interesting - Feel like a total badass whilst wrecking everything in your path - Large choice of weaponry and armour (anything to tailor your destructive needs) - Online servers are very, very good. Hardly ever any drop in connection etc.  Cons: - Lengthy wait on the foundry for a lot of weapons and items (patience is required for better gear but not complaining) - There are A LOT of micro DLC options (again not complaining but they're everywhere in game) - Sometimes struggle to find a team to match up with (not all the time)  That's really it. Like I said if you haven't already, pick this game back up, it has its own launcher/patcher now as an external output from Steam once you've downloaded it from the store to your library but yeah, truly loving this game at the moment and cannot wait to reach endgame content!  - Ryzun",

They now have these 'fissures' that pop up though-out the mission and you need to collect these relics from the fissures as you kill things in order to get very rare items.  The Problem: You need to complete a misson WHILE doing this, and some missions need to be done first, before worrying about gathering these relics which pop up through the entire time that you are doing the mission and even after as long as you don't exit. In one such case there is a capture mission where you need to run after a guy and shoot him down and 'capture' him. The problem is, not everyone is a team player and happily collect their relics as you run off to catch the bad guy. Then, once the capture is done and the OTHER people who didn't help collect all their relics, go off to exit. You MUST get all your relics in order to get your rare item (You need 10), so since you were single handedly chasing this guy down because others cannot be bothered, you could risk losing your chance on getting the rare item if the people close the mission out on you.  The void fissure method, I do like it, but there are some styles of missions it should NOT be on. To top it off, they now also have a guy that will appear in missions who are very strong and can appear in these fissure missions. My boyfriend and I were running off to get the capture target, while the other 2 decided to do their own thing, then this guy also came and was kicking our asses, while we are also trying to take down the capture target and eventually they came to help, but refused to revive anyone who fallen, then since they had all their fissures they were about to go close the mission. Luckily they didn't but my bf used up the last of his self-revive while trying to get the fissures, and he lost out on the entire mission.. fun right?   This game has brought out a lot more d*cks, and my ignore list of blocking these players is going to get very full very fast.",

So let me just summarize some Pros and Cons.  PROS: - The game has AMAZING graphics, for it requiring such a low performance - The gameplay is very fluently and addicting - The Community is truly great, I did not encounter one toxic player so far. - You Do not nead any other players to complete any missions, everything is soloable (except Raids) - You can change every Weapon, character or companion to your personal play style. - there are scheduled Dev streams where the dev will interact with the community  CONS: - The game is hard to learn, I started playing with a good friend of mine, and we had trouble learning all the details about mods, crafting and everything... If you do not have any contacts in the game, visit the forums or any other place to get Information about the game - The game requires a lot of time, meaning that the characters (Warframes) you can farm are seperated in different drops, (Helmet,Chasis Systems, Blueprint etc) which all drop from different sources.(And are Rng based) - You need a lot of platinum (ingame currency) to equip your account   MICROTRANSACTIONS  Yes, the game is free, yes there are microtransactions... so how do I start this... with the ingame currency (platinum) you can buy cosmetics,ships and the newest update stuff (weapons,warframes,ships etc)  You Can however trade the stuff you farmed on the market with other players against platinum or other items.  Also, there is this thing called slots.. For weapons and Warframes... You need platinum to be able to own more weapons and Warframes, which is quite exepnsive should you plan on getting all warframes...   What made me stop playing:  The simple reason I stopped playing was that there is no actual skill improvement. After I got everything you could have gotten in that time I started realizing that all I am doing is getting the new released items, stop playing, waiting for an update and get the new released items again.  There is NO actualy skill improvement compared to many other games  (I will just use csgo,chess or smth like this as an example)   END WORDS   This is a truly great game, I can just recomment playing it, it has amazing graphics,story and gameplay supported by a great community. But prepare to have a lot of struggles learning the basics  On my last note I can leave the hint that the Game has a lot of little 'features' I did not adress here simply to not spoil the game.",

If you want to kill everything you can do it. It will not get very much loot but you will level up more. On the other hand if you wan to get as much loot as possable you might look for crates and lockers off the mission path. The result is you get more loot but less X.P. because if you do the missions quickly you could go through two or three missions as someone getting loot got through one. I love how the game lets you play any style of playing.  My pros are: -what I said above -unique upgrade system -great tutorial -SPACE SHIPS!!! -gives you a choice of weapons and the begining giving you the choice of going loud or quiet.  -giving lots of different tenos (characters) to play as -lots of different game play options -unique unlocking different maps/levels system CONS: -takes me and my friends 10 trys to connect to eachother's game -pay to win aspect -have to guess what bosses to beat to get to a certaint planet  This concludes it.

Only positive maybe is you can earn premium currency in game so you don't have to spend real cash on game, but without it don't hope for good stuff !  I got all in game, but BEST stuff, best premium frames, premium weapons and mods , i bought everything because RNG will give you ♥♥♥♥ ! Of my 1 man army set up i bought 90% of stuff with premium currency !  It's grind fest, it's linear as ♥♥♥♥, grinding different items make no sens cuz they are usless.  This is game for ppls who like to take screenshoots of their avatars, cuz they are ugly IRL like dogs, and post them around internet !

Oh, also, our fanbase loves to complain about balance.' what about the PVP mode?' 'what? oh, right we have a PVP mode. erm.... yeah, we preffer to pretend it doesn't exist. We add in some mods every now and again, but, it's pretty much ♥♥♥♥, just focus on PVE.' ok, so how good is this PVE? 'well, does farm, rinse, repeat sound apealing to you? no? well ♥♥♥♥ you, we offer you a dull, unforgiving, unrewarding RNG based-reward system that is completely based on luck.' how dull is it? 'Imagine every single recently added item is the Cobra from BL2. all of which are added on the same places, on the same rotations.' ok,. but how about graphics? 'ok, that's actually really good. I mean, we basicly cut every single cent from creative department to put it in the graphical guys, and sound, and BOY did they deliver.' ooookkk, so I get a dull but pretty game? 'yes. oh, aslo we throw in some half-♥♥♥♥♥ excuse for quests. The only really good one is second dream and Natah, and after the ones after these are kinda decent as well.' riiight, so it's basicly Destiny only free? 'yeah, pretty much. well at least we don't insult our players saying they'll throw money at the screen, but the RNG is just as much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and just as boring.' ok, so, after I finish pretty much everything, maxed all weapons, frames, AWs, AW weapons, what do I do? 'pft, ♥♥♥♥ if we know, kill some things maybe, get a hammer and bash a Corpus' head in, I don't care, buy some deluxe/immortal/Tennogen skins and make us rich so you can show off in the relays, buy spaceshit skins to tell everyone you spent money on a loading screen, buy a Syandana, I don't care, give us money. Hey, at least we're not adding microtransaction safes and drills with augmented weapons, geez.' erm... yeah, I guess you got that going for you.....oh, what about lore- 'PFTHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAH *breathes in* hahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaha *breathing intensifies* ohh, boy, that slaps me on the knee, uhhhh, phew, hah, no, we, we don't have a lore. I mean, we DO but it's so convoluted and underexposed that any casual player would only know about it if they did 'Natah' and the 'Second Dream' quests, and let's face it, any new and casual player probably couldn't give less of a ♥♥♥♥ about quests, they just want to shoot ♥♥♥♥.' sooo you're saying not to get the game Mr. Critic? what? NO, it's a great and fun game, if you don't have OCD and likes to complete a game 100%, if you're here to kick ♥♥♥ and, well, NOT chew bubblegum, as Warframes have no mouths, then this game will probably be fun for you, but if you'd like to do that, while use a great variaty of weapons (most of which suck dong) then make sure you have either A. Money to spare and spend here; B. a lot of time in your hands; or C. Buckets and buckets of unending luck.",

I felt it necessary to adress this game from a midpoint perspective: I don't have an insane playtime count ingame, but nor am I new to this genre.  So, if you can run Warframe, and haven't yet: what on Earth are you doing? Even if you aren't one for farming or mindless slaughter, give this game a college try. It's fun, varied and quite unique in its styling and storytelling. I personally didn't expect much from a freebie, but **** was I wrong. The random generation of maps, the simple fact that RNG won't constantly **** with you (unless you want Equinox :P) and resource hunting is enjoyable.  On the other hand, nothing in life is perfect (except the deity of your belief, of course). This game has bugs and its assortment of issues. Enemy's armour scales to the point where only cheesing the game does anything; some frames are stupidly better than others; and of course random bugs and glitches. You'd expect the devs to pay more attention to these key issues rather than shoving content down the launcher and nerfs up the frame's backsides, but thats the reality.   So, with all that said and done, is Warframe worth your time? Absolutely! Despite its issues, the game stands out as a shining beacon in its genre of a looter-shooter, only really outshadowed by Borderlands 1 &amp; 2 (Destiny? Don't get me started &gt;:| ), which is saying alot for a freebie. The devs have been a bit careless recently and some recent changes were stupid if not unecessary, but the game lives on. People complaining about the endless grind: They are immature. Why sign up for a game that OPENLY admits it's a grinder, and then complain about it? People claiming a lack of content? Name ONE game that has endless content, and enough content to live over 2000 hours? None? Thats what I thought.... (Multiplayer only games 'content' is different in the fact that they don't effect total playtime, because they don't dramatically change playstyles like PvE items do)   So, to end this review: Is it a good time to jump into Warframe as a rookie? Definitely. Are you a veteran wanting to try come back to your old stomping grounds? Maybe not yet.... DE are still implimenting changes for late-end game content. But, alas, I return to the long wait for the War Within.  Thanks for reading this review. Go back to playing games..... Go...... ",

When I get the itch to play it again, I reinstall it, and then spend a considerable amount of time glued to wikis and walkthrough videos, trying to make heads or tails of the changes that have happened since I was gone. It's easy to get lost in the ever-changing landscape of this game, and you best not get too attached to any one aspect of it, as it could be gone with the next update.  Now, at the time of my yearly rage quits, I might be inclined to not recommend this game, but that is ultimately unfair. Despite the long hours of grinding, or constantly having to rely on the internet to tell me how to complete certain tasks, or the sudden jumps in difficulty without warning, this still remains the best free-to-play game I've encountered, hands down. For me, the enjoyment outweighs the frustration. (And of all the games that require a lot of grinding, I definitely have the most fun doing it in this one.)  What you get in the end is a third-person action game with extremely satisfying controls (most of the time), gorgeous (if repetitive) environments, and a lot of fun crafting and management elements, all with a price tag of zero. My advice to you is to heed the warnings of the negative reviews, and then give it a shot anyway.",

I just do wish that the long-term gameplay loop wasn't centered around endlessly grinding for new weapons and frames, and more about something a bit more meaningful. Then again, the sense of worth and meaning one derives from a game is completely subjective, so take from this what you will. Certainly recommended for those who have the time.",

That said, this is probably the best F2P out there. Fantastic mobility and control, satisfying as all hell in terms of high level weaponry, this game's core gameplay loop is fun as all hell.  Which is good, because this game is also a bit of a grindfest, especially earlier on when you're stuck to the lower difficulty planets which yield less rewards. Stick with it past that hump and you'll be rewarded plenty.  Also, be aware that while you can buy everything in the game with the cash shop currency, Platinum, not everything in the cash shop is worth buying at ALL. In fact only a few things are. Don't buy without a guide!   The good news is, Platinum can be traded between players, so if you're willing to do the farming that others don't want to, there is nothing in this game that you can't get for free.  This game is a bit 'mysterious', the lore and other stuff about it isn't obvious. If you're willing to dig into it a bit, and figure things out for yourself, it's awesome. If you want to be guided, this isn't for you.",

When I first started playing back in June '13, it was a cool little game to just collect stuff in, level up items, and fool around a bit. The game underwent a major overhaul for its PS4 release and is now expanding in all categories including lore, map variety, mods, weapons, and warframes. I updated this review pre-update 14, and the additional quest/lore system, upcoming mass-UI, and player ships are HUGE improvements to look forward which will further solidify the game as a serious and unqiue title.   The mechanics are very attractive, mixing fast movement with gunplay/melee combat and the special powers of each warframe. The mod system can change up combat as you see fit, and any gun/melee/warframe is viable with enough love put into it. The graphics are bright and shiny, and the game is pretty well-optimized for older systems. Tile sets for maps are finally taking the game off of ships and onto planets. Sounds for enemies and environments continue to be updated for the better. Dojos offer players a way to create clans and design/decorate their own 'house' of sorts. Warframes and weapons can have customized color, attachements, armor, skins, and syndanas (scarves).   Best of all, the game boasts a dedicated developer team who usually respond quickly and respectfully to the thoughts and wishes of the community. They even run live streams which are fun to watch and offer a kind of interaction that a lot of games miss. One of the biggest improvements I've seen due to this dev-player interaction is through events, which were once extremely annoying due to their setup but are now engaging and fair to both the occassional player and the diehard clan alike.   The cash shop for this game is also rather extreme but this is F2P and to be expected. The game lacks dedicated servers, but several changes put into the grouping system have made joining a terrible host much less common. The pve/psueo-pvp Dark Sector system was arguably released too early and right now doesn't offer players/alliances much benefit. However, with DE's track record, it's suitable to have faith the Dark Sectors will continue to be improved upon. There is an actual pvp system in the game, but having never bothered with it, I can't offer any opinion.   RNG is perhaps the one big drawback of this game. Much of the game's content relies on RNG, which after a while gets very tiresome. To date, not much has been done to allow players to have some influence over RNG (except outright buying said items through store or prime access) and there are many tweaks that could be made to make things less grindy..  Yet, there's a lot of good in the game and all the reason to trust that improvements will continue. If the game had some kind of membership system, I'd definitely buy into it without a second thought. It's plenty obvious this game is growing and growing quickly under focused guidance. It's good to see a team that's not afraid to remain in the beta phase and still get stuff done. High hopes for this one!",

It is still a fun game and the platinum thing doesnt take away from the gameplay, just that it later in the game it becomes anoying.

Yes, it has a tendency to grind, yes not every update is what you want/expect, and yes (sadly) they often use the legendary 'nerf-hammer'  So is it perfect? Nope. Not in a long shot. But is it a really good game in it's genre? I doubt you can argue this, especially considering its free2play. I'd advise you to play this game with your friends, help eachother out, do weird stuff!

To an outsider looking in Warframe may look like absolute sensory overload, a good looking Free-to-Play Game with high-octane action throughout any mission. At second Glance however, a steep learning curve, lack of explanation on the Game's part and huge Grindwall may turn any newcomer off, if there isn't persistence in that Gamers mind. Lastly at third Glance, the Game's depth and true potential may be finally seen, as the Gamer reads up on all the little hidden mechanics, gets in touch with the mechanics and learns how to overcome his own lack of persistence. The only thing remaining is the Grind, but if it's fun, is that a bad thing? :P    Pros:",

I've used the trade chat and farming to make enough money to get almost anything I've ever wanted in this game. And if I couldn't afford it, there was enough other options to get by with that I didn't care.  - Great action combat between every weapon type imaginable. Shotguns/ assault rifles/ great swords/ lasers/ katanas/ ninja stars/ scythes/ cannons/ grenade lauchers/ etc.  - HUGE variety in weapons, classes-(frames), and mods-(builds) that allows a broad selection of play styles. The builds can be changed at any time for free.  - Super active community full of helpful people. The region chat is always active, no matter what time I log on.  Cons: - Not enough content. I was bored very early in this game, but I found goals to keep me playing. Mostly farming for a weapon I thought was interesting, or a frame, trying different builds for weapons and frames, etc.  - Very fast paced and antisocial in most public games with strangers. Not enough time to communicate because players rather compete for the most kills or the highest damage, then rush to the extraction and never see them again. It's better with clan members though.  - I can see it slowly transitioning into the endless RNG grind that mmorpgs are notorious for. They've recently added Riven mods (extremely strong mods), which cost kuva, kuva takes a long time to farm. You use kuva to reroll the stats on a riven mod. Also, riven mods are for random weapons. You don't get to choose which weapon it will be for. As you reroll the random stats, it begins to cost more kuuva each time, forcing you to go grind more kuva, searching for those perfect stats.  They said Riven mods were to encourage players to use older, weaker weapons, but they also gave riven mods to the META, the best weapons... That's not going to encourage us to play older/weaker weapons. It's going to force us to buy or grind for Riven mods for the BEST weapons if we want to keep up. And since players are selling these Riven mods for THOUSANDS of platinum, the grind is becoming ridiculous.",

The main issues I would say about this game come into play whether or not you want to spend IRL money. You do not ever NEED to spend IRL money for this game. It isn't as much pay to win as much pay to rush. You pay to get things you don't feel like waiting for. In this regard I feel the biggest downside of the game is how much effort you will put into getting something that you won't use. A lot of weapons aren't as effecient, despite having really cool designs and it feels bad spending the time to upgrade a weapon just to have it underperform.   If there is a specific warframe that you want. I would recommend buying them if you're going to spend and IRL money. I wound up quiting the game for a long time because I didn't like the starter frame I chose. Not because they were bad but because the didn't feel good for me to play. However, coming back buying the one I thought looked coolest at the time hooked me on this game for a consecutive 3 months. It has it's issues sure overall this is a great game.

Customization is also one of the best i've seen, next to GTA V online.  Gameplay is what its all about though. If you hate games in which you have to grind, dont ever think about downloading this game. Since it is f2p, expect a massive grind. And oh my the grind. But if you play with your friends, you are going to love htis game. Very rewarding experience because of the grind though.   Community is quite literally the best there is. I have met some veteran players while i was Master Rank 2 and they helped me out so much, without even thinking twice about it. The community of this game is what makes it shine. Also Join a Clan! Clans are what make this game that much more fun!  Few games have ever had me addicted to it to the point where i dream about it (seriously dream about it) Warframe is actually the third. Others Being Dragons Dogma and Skyrim.   It is definetely worth a try if you like mmos but stay away if you dont like grinding.   Overall a (9.5/10), (sometimes the grind is a bit too over the top)",

Where you go from here is up in the wind unless you heavily research into what actions you should do. Warframe is not something I can call intuitive at all. When I first started playing, I heavily researched on what to do for reference, and had the luck of knowing someone who is a complete veteran of the game.  Knowing someone who already plays can just boost you in progress within the game by having someone with know-how advising your actions. Otherwise, get use to research.  This game is just so damn expansive and is constantly growing that its current steam rating doesn't really reflect on the quatlity of the game. Warframe is an easy 80/100+ for its rating.  The fact that the game constantly changes means that it's quallity should also change but actually doesnt.  I advise anyone to play this game for an hour and say that it doesnt look badass.",

Survival, defense, exterminate, void runs, dark sectors, pvp, quests, even a relay for you to just chill and talk some crap with others. The community of players is great; they're very patient with newbies. I've been very happy with how the players, especially high-levelled ones, patiently deal with the new guys and even people who still kind of suck like me. Melee combat is really fun especially if you have stance mods on, and combat overall flows very smoothly. One moment you could be wallrunning, then the next hanging on the wall and picking those neat headshots, then rolling on the ground and slicing someone in half... You get the idea. Many newbies also complain about the apparent pay2win factor of warframe, but in reality, this is one of the few games left that you don't NEED to spend money on to actually get good. This is currently my favourite game, and as far as I'm concerned, this stands proud among some of the huge paid games around.",

UPDATE: While this is still the best F2P game that I've played so far, which doesn't necessarily say much, I can't recommend it to anyone. It's fun for awhile, even with all the grinding, but the endgame is just a chore without a speck of fun. The people that live in region chat but don't actually play the game keep constantly whining about stuff not being hard enough and now things are getting more and more annoying for those of us that actually play the game.  The game is also full of bugs/glitches that never seem to get fixed. They keep trying to implement new systems that only end up adding to the pile instead of actually fixing anything. Connection related issues are some of the worst. You'll get dropped mid-mission for absolutely no reason and lose everything you had.  Region chat used to be fairly helpful to new players, but it's become a toxic pit that should be avoided like the plague. There are a dozen or so people that literally sit in Region trolling all day without actually playing the game. In my Region there's a few that have been acting like gods of the game since they were Mastery Rank 6, spouting definitive remarks about popular weapons and frames that they've never even used. Even the moderators act like, and probably are, little children with too much power.  This isn't really a game related problem but people in trading can be real ♥♥♥♥♥. There's a big division between people that just stick to trade chat and people that live based on some external trading website and think that it's THE definitive trading resource. The people that stick to trade chat are usually pretty reasonable, although as with any market there are people trying to scam new players, while the others are usually just terrible to deal with. They'll instantly ignore you if you don't offer them as much as or more than their precious website says their item is worth, or they'll completely freak out on you and call you every name in the book before demanding an insane price, basically trying to bully you into paying what they want. Realistically, the stuff is only worth as much as you're willing to pay, but very few people realize that.  The rank system means nothing. The game is full of MR 21s (current max player rank), that are dumb as rocks and have no real experience with anything, but they act like they're pros that have been playing for years.   A lot of the rewarding stuff is designed to force you to play with other people which is really dumb, unless you have a handful of friends to play with. The worst part of this is that the game is jam packed with leeches and idiots. So unless you have reliable friends to play with, you have to grind your ♥♥♥ off and get really good at everything so that you can just solo almost everything and avoid the mountain of hassle associated with going public. Although, even when you complete it, your reward is completely in the hands of RNG and the RNG in this game is absolutely terrible.  Also, unless you have amazing internet, you're gonna be spending a ton of time trying to find squads for the stuff that you need other people for, like raids and keysharing. And if you do ever host something and there's like 1ms of ping difference from what the others joining are used to, they're gonna ♥♥♥♥♥ non-stop until you're done with whatever you're doing.  I used to really, really like this game, but now I can barely bring myself to login once a day. I haven't had a single day in well over a year where the game worked without issue. Save yourself a lot of time and money and go find something else.  Update 11/25/2016: After much time away from this game, I came back to find that the developers have driven this game so much further down the crapper than I could've ever imagined. They've made many systems much more convoluded and grindy than before, nerfed most of the characters completely into the ground, and made the odds of getting anything good far worse. Also, they still haven't fixed any of the real issues that have persisted for years.",

The concept is the same- level up your gear, kill everything in sight, and repeat. It's a very hollow, yet effective concept.  It's F2P platform is one of the best and has been debated as being a number one platform among all F2P games.   It should be noted that this game will take away one thing from you; it's either time or money, but trading in-game items proves its worth.  Key-points: *Vast array of weapons. *Varying combat styles of your choice. *The grind is extreme. *Classes are superb and unique. *Quests are decent. *Frequent content updates, hotfixes, and major updates. *A true F2P game- everything can be earned by in-game grinded resources and currency (besides the steam curator cosmetic items, this all depends on how much time you can spend playing the actual game).",

Especially if you like ninja robots :P  It is also important to mention that this game has a pretty steep learning curve. It takes a while to get used to the mechanics and it definetely takes a bunch of reading to become up to date with which mods to use to upgrade your items etc.  The movement in the game is quite smooth and it is very enjoyable to practically parkour through all the different layouts, it is however not all 'maps' that are optimized for this type of movement, which is a shame as it is one of my favorite parts of the game.

See the negative issues addressed in the reviews are all 100% valid. But, they don't really become applicable until you either finish the story line (loosely speaking) or reach Mastery Rank 8. The former takes 3-4 weeks. The latter takes roughly 2-3 weeks. The roughest experiences I have had were when I started out and when I was finally crashing. The middle portion or about 80% of the time I spent on this game were well spent. Some people claim grinding is difficult and while it is there were other means that I sometimes used. I'll be honest (no hacks or cheats) i made somewhere around $600 worth of platinum without inputting any amount of my own money on this game. Just depends on how well you utilize the market chat. Also, compared to games I have played like CS:GO, League of Legends, Overwatch, etc the warframe community + devs made the game super welcoming.  Five things I loved: 1. Combat + Parkour (Best update + removing stamina) 2. Solar Rails (Disabled due to monopolization by Alliances I was part of one) 3. New content every week sometimes twice a week/Events (LOVE EVENTS) 4. Graphics for F2P game 5. Clans/Alliances (Research material and recognition)  Five things I hated: 1. Trade market (players have no idea what they are doing, scammers, toxicity) 2. Prime Frame drop locations and ABC rotation (had to play intervals of 40 minutes of T3 Survival for 1 piece which had 0.01% drop rate) 3. Viability of frames, I hate playing solely healer but trinity is loved for grinding yet no one wants to play it sadly oberon healing not very viable 4. Baro Ki Teer (items are overpriced to hell) 5. Resources drop rate (have like million of alloy plates after 10 hours of grinding but 3 neural sensors LOL)  I would recommend playing this game and enjoying the game staying away from trade market, prime frames, and the meta. Just ignore that stuff. Don't do what I did. I would grind my gear up to top tier and solo Tier 4 Survival for 60 minutes on several different frames. It burned me out and all the aspects of the game that were fun for me are somewhat gone (solar rails, recognition for being in a clan, addition of more chance in drops). If you take a break from the game its pretty hard to get back into it because of how quickly content gets added. However, if you listen to the things I say to ignore, then you will enjoy the game assuming you can get over the initial entrance hurdle for about 1-2 months. ",

            "review_text": "Warframe is a nice looking adrenaline pumped co-op multiplayer shooter with science fiction environment and fighting-sliding-shooting mercenaries from the guys who co-created the Unreal series. In the last year or so it got a lot of new content which transformed the game. With these updates of course came a lot of problems.  Good: Intensive combat with unique elements. Great amount of customization options, lots of equipment, mods and accessories. Decent graphics, good performance. Nicely designed, varied game modes. Co-op play is fun. You can obtain most things through regular gameplay without paying for it. Regular updates and patches. Extensive universe with plenty to do and explore. The usual mmo grind exists in Warframe too, but it is more enjoyable. Players farm instance keys, mods, resources, blueprints for warframes and gear, and of course credits.  Bad: Lag issues with hosts with bad internet connection or location. Occasional migration and other issues are annoying. Bugs on missions, new maps containing places where it is easy to stuck. Archwing movement is pretty confusing at first, and blade feels overpowered. Sometimes hard to find people to play with due to the many sectors, making the progress harder later in the game. Combat system could be dull and repetitive after some time. New, simplified movement is pretty much broken, which can be especially annoying during retrieval missions. Geometry collusions also not help the situations. Many elements break the flow. Almost anything could be bought with platinum in the shop or in the trading chat. As far as I know there are only two ways to trade your goods with other players. One option is the good-old trade chat, other one is the bazaar where you walk around with the stuff you want to get rid off floating above your head. It is like it was made intentionally hard to get rare parts from easier sources without paying for it or grinding for days. Prime warframes contionously get 'vaulted' which means that they are getting removed from drop tables and only paying players can obtain them. Some of these primes are also objectively better which was not the case before.  Overall, Warframe is a decent game. Expansions came and it became more bugged and devs messed up a lot of things, but frequent patches maintain playability. However, there are days when a recent patch ruins the game. The amount of added content is impressive, however a few features feel reckless. If you do not want to pay the game becomes extremely grindy, and of course there are stuff which can be bought only with real money. The ultimate problem remains the fact that you cannot play alone thus it is hard to unlock whole planets if you do not have someone beside you as there is no proper scaling based on player count. This makes progress for new player basically impossible. And this review is for those who did not play the game yet, thus this is going to be a no. The game is too convoluted to be any fun for anyone who starts it anew.   MY OPINION: 7.5/10 (GOOD)  Graphics: 8/10 World Design: 7/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Sound: 8/10 Replay Value: 8/10 Free-to-Play Model: 6/10",

As somebody with over 1000 hours on this game (i played alot on another steam account) I can say that it is a quite enjoyable game, especially if played with friends.

The early-game when you're just learning and don't have much can seem slow and tedious at first but stick with it, I promise it's worth it in the end. If you need any help with things then most clans or alliances are full of people more than willing to help you and if they don't, the forums or reddit are full of helpful people too.   As I said though, if DE doesn't stop adding the grindy content and ignoring the players they're going to lose their player-base which while it isn't small, its not exactly huge for a strictly multiplayer game. The annoying thing is, the people I see leaving this game, leave it for the smallest reason because DE just refuse to go back and bugfix old content.  Still, personally I think for a free game it's definetly worth a play for anyone who likes jumping around slashing dudes up with a katana, scythe or just melting them with corrosive pirate cannons.",

            "review_text": "CURRENT RECOMMENDED STATUS:  Watching, light playing, absoutly no contribution to devlopment (paying money)   UPDATE 2: So another quest and warframe came out recently, not a huge fan but it went largly without issue except one of the new frames abilities. It can 'infect' other players. Now while inter player interaction is often a good thing for a co-op PvE game this crosses a line and I will explain. At the very beginning of the game you get this thing stuck to your leg and by completing the Intro/tutorial quest you can remove it. I did not play the game at first launch but I am sure I can safely assume that it was removeable from the start. This new frame gives you a cyst on your neck. Not pretty. But you should be able to guess the problem. You can't remove it yet. Although I am all for this level of interaction and I am sure the Devs have something in line to use these things besides a completely useless pet, it should not take a week of work to undo something some other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ did to you. I have fluxuated with giving positive and negative review to this game and not we are back in the red. The Devs really need to get their priorities straight and push things when they are all the way complete not half ♥♥♥♥♥ with issues the they should know from experience will ♥♥♥♥ us off to great length. I should not have to play this game solo to avoid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of the world. One bad apple can truly ruin the basket full. The devs dont even give us a way to remove the one bad one. Untill they do I will remove myself from the rotting heap.   UPDATE 1: So I have picked back up this game after a while and am pleased to say most if not all issues I had were fixed is some patches/updates since I posted my original review. I now must say that this game is back to being a very good intersting and fun experience. However as many I simply have fallen out of playing due to finding something else after I left before. I will return when there is more unexplorerd content. Until then I wish the devs the best of luck and some bette update days in the future.  Original Review: This game is just great. Good game play, good variety, good player base, good re playability. But is has one huge fail, and I do mean HUGE fail. This past update was rushed and everyone who knows anything know it. It was poorly implemented and is the worst example of poor Quality Assurance/In House Testing I have ever seen. This is a pathetic example of people that don’t care. Either the game devs don’t give a dam about their players or the fan-boys are screaming so loud in their ear they cant hear legitimate issues. Honestly if the game rolled back to the patch pre-'Sands of Failure' this would be my most recommended game to my friends. Now I would not recommend them play if it was the last game in existence. I continue to play to try and keep up with the new events and test to see if their 'Hotfixes' (which often fix issues nobody even knew existed) solve the constant crashing issues. Here is a short list of only some of the places I crash.   Checking for updates Log-on Prompt Orbiter (Think Menu) Middle of a match Three kills from the end of an hour long mission (I didn’t get the rewards) During the end of mission screen (didn’t get rewards from this either) After the end of mission screen (again no rewards) While trying to build something in my foundry While trying to manage my mods While browsing the market While checking my codex While queuing for a mission  Get my drift? Since the last update I am crashing ALL the time. Before I NEVER had a single crash. I experienced some lag here and there and a few oopses but no CTD and the game never kicked me out in the middle of a mission. This past update was a disgrace to its developers and a disgrace to its community. Yes I am angry, yes I am ♥♥♥♥♥♥. And yes I CAN do a better job. Do it right or don’t do it at all.   To those of you who will inevitably claim I have a crap PC, I have a very very good system and a very stable setup. Outside of this game I have not had one BSOD or CTD for any other game unless I intentionally break it. there is no excuse for this, this is pure laziness or ignorance. I regret paying for the Prime Access pack I got. the devs don’t deserve the support if they push this kind of garbage to us.  The game was great before and the game is still great, if you can over look the constant crashes. I can't eat a crash every other game so for me it is time for a better game where the devs check their work.   Sub note, although I posted this review durring the time of the DDoS attacks the problems existed before they started. The attackes just made them worse and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off enough to actually hit submit this time. It stand by what I said, although it may not seem as bad if you dont play as much as I do.",

            "review_text": "WARNING: This review is long  This game can be summed up in three words:  - Grind - RNG - A s**tton of updates  OK, strictly speaking that's six words, but it still sums up the game. I feel that I've recently got out of it, but that's just because I've got reasonably far and kind of lost interest. I know I'm not the kind of person who's played over 3,000 hours, but I still know the game well, having been playing it for 3 years now, totalling up to 640 hours of Warframe. There is one good reason for this: It's a lot of fun. Starting from havng nothing and finding Rare Mods, getting Prime weapons etc. is absorbing and even tactical.  HOWEVER, there is a difference between absorbing and time-consuming. You wouldn't like it if you're impatient or don't like grinds (or RNG...), and getting the good stuff in Warfame is HEAVILY dependent on both of those. But if you don't mind those, then there really is A HECK OF A LOT TO DO in Warframe. The amount of content is staggering, considering it's Free-To-Play (though most cool cosmetics are only obtainable with micro-transactions). You'll feel like a (forcing myself to use the word) noob at the start - as in REALLY feel like one - when you see the Rank 30 Grand Masters with Primes and all the Cosmetics etc,, but if you put time into it it can be VERY fun.  My main problems have sprung up in the newer updates (The War Within as ironically what finally pushed me away from Warframe, when I'd hoped for it to hook me back in), and I will list them here:  - Riven Mods (My least favourite thing ever) - Rare Mods that you really want but can never find or are actually unobtainable except through trading, forcing you to buy platinum or get rid of prime parts - Virtually unobtainable Prime Weapons (Nikana Prime...) - New content rushing in far too quickly, such as an amazing new thing coming when you're still farming for the cool new content from 2 BLOODY UPDATES AGO  Riven Mods, as a separate note, I absolutely loath. I once got one, but after trying with nearly every primary weapon I own to unlock it and nothing happening, I realised, 'This is probably for a weapon I don't even use.' It is just a schlep to unlock them and you might not even like what they offer. The only other way to obtain them is through trading, and they are traded A LOT, but that forces you to buy platinum, which a lot of people don't want to do, seeing as it's expensive.  Rare Mods can be a bit 'meh' at times, but some are just un-live-without-able, such as Jagged Edge, Vital Sense, etc. But them problem is that they're called 'Rare' for a reason. I spent 2.5 years hunting for Jagged Edge and Vital Sense before I finally got them, and had to resort to platinum to buy Crushing Ruin. Hunting for good mods is the most frustrating thing in Warframe.  I could write a lot about Warframe, but that would make the review too long. The best way to understand what I mean is to try the game out.  So you may ask, why is this review positive?  Answer: Because some people are more patient than others, and some can sink a lot of time into a very time-reliant game.  If you are patient (as in very) and can sink a lot of time into a game, then Warframe is definitely the game for you.  And when you become a Rank 30 Grand Master with Primes and all the Cosmetics etc., you will REALLY feel like one.  Give it a go, and see if you like it. Just remember that progress is slow and starting is difficult, and that there is a grind unlike anything you've ever seen.",
