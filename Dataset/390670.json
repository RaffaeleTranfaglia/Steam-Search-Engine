            "review_text": "Is this a copy of World of Warships? No, it's better. Here's why:  + Gunnery requires skill. The longer you aim, the more accurate the guns will become. Turning the vessel even a little bit will spoil your aim, as it should be.   + Torpedoes also require skill to use; there's no overlay telling you exactly when and where to shoot torps. If you want to slam an entire volley of fish from your DD into a battleship, you'll need to get close to it. A BB's secondaries can rake you hard if you do. Which brings up...  + Direct control of secondaries! See Wargaming? That wasn't so hard, was it? Direct control of AA guns, as well.  + Big tech trees for three nations. Two more placeholders. Far more ships here than in WoWS.  + Submarines! See Wargaming? That wasn't so hard, was it? And depth charges, too. A couple of DDs taking it to a submerged u-boat is great fun. This gives the DDs a really imporant role in fleet engagements, as a sub getting in close to your battleline or carriers can wreak havoc in very short order.  + Battleships don't suck. They actually have useful armor. DDs and CLs can't just hang back and flamethrower a BB to death. Small caliber artillery will bounce off of a BB's armor belt, though you can penetrate their thinly-armored decks if you can finagle a hit on them. Your best bet is to close to torp range in a group. Make no mistake: a single DD is quite capable of ruining a BB's day if she gets in under the guns.  + Battleship main batteries hit HARD. If you land a solid volley on a non-capital vessel, it's toast.  + More advanced crew management. There are a lot of different crewmen with a huge variety of activated skills, and they acquire more skills with experience. It's almost RPG-ish in nature.  + Detailed equipment and consumables in a large variety.   + World of Tanks style vessel progression. You upgrade individual parts of the ship as you wish.  + There's a very unique 'investment' system, whereby you can invest gold in your future progression, which will pay off with interest as you unlock higher tiers.   + A renown system which you can play to increase your rank. Rewards are given out at the end of each 'season' based upon the rank you achieve. Better play increases your rank, and vice versa.  + Buy gold direct through the Steam wallet. This puts a layer of security between you and the foreign game company.   In short, everything that's wrong with WoWS has been fixed here. Downside? Not much:  - Graphics aren't quite as pretty as WoWS, but still quite acceptable, especially if you crank it up to ultra. I'm playing on a four year old box and it handles ultra no problem.  - Wonky support for triple monitor (FOV is too close). This, however, is a very minor issue, as I realize I'm in the extreme minority of users of Surround/Eyefinity.  - Some minor translation issues, but they're more subtle than gross. Just convention and usage, nothing game breaking. Most people probably won't even notice, or care if they do. I certainly don't.   This is my naval game, now. Adios, WoWS. Nice knowin' ya, but I'm moving on.",

The argument really boils down to that since both games kinda want to milk your wallet. Both games indulge in premium stuff, both games are grindy and honestly if you already play Warships but are interested in something like submarines or ships generally having more options, I'd give Steel Ocean a try just to see if it scratches your itch.",

Lots of sastisfying moments, like firing a salvo of large guns, figuring out the perfect torpedo spread, or diving right before battleship shells land on you.  Submarines are balanced overall. Time-limited diving with a lengthy recharge, and destroyers and cruisers have depth charges that can wreck you at any tier. They can also hit you with torpedos at periscope depth. Death against unattentive battleships and carriers, though. Hard to hit while surfaced.  Battleships have a long-range view, like the slanted artillery mode in Armored Warfare. Guns are hard to aim but accuracy improves if you shoot at a single area. Lots of BB players forget to exit arty mode though and get torpedoed to death. BBs include manually operated secondary guns to hit those destroyers and such that sneak in. Can't do anything to subs except sit on them.  Carriers have some number of deck slots where you can assemble your own squadrons to send out, of scouts, fighters, tbombers or dbombers. Tbombers are not overpowered. All planes die quickly to people manually directing AA, so they're best against busy people.  Destroyers are just fun as hell.  Don't have an opinon on cruisers yet. Like bigger destroyers, so not as nimble.",

Destroyers cannot expect to fight BB's and win, the ammunition models seem correct from the outset. Torpedoes are limited, and there's no guide or 'auto aim' so SKILL is required.  The submarine gameplay is challenging, yet rewarding, as a Surface ship captain they are a worthy foe and also play a valid role in the battle.  I am HUGELY impressed. Well done ICE Entertainment, my only small critisicm is the graphics are less 'polished' but I'm happy to accept this in light of the awesome gameplay.

Anywho, The aiming feels a tad clunky. nothing a few matches won't help you get used to. Gameplay wise, it's similar to World of Warships with more Ships. Light cruisers feels a bit heavy I would say. BB is... well, in WoW. You were this big hunk of hard metal. Slow but relatively hard to kill. In this game, they took all that hard metal away and replaced it with tin. Firepower is still there, but you can go down pretty quick especially from sneaky DDs/SS and CVs which drop torps and dive bombers on you. CVs are more like the same, RTS and all the shenanigans. SS is what you'd expect and DDs are DDs. Annoying little buggers.   As for p2w concerns. There are 'Premium' Ammo which are a cut above the rest which cost 2 gold(Cash currency) per ammo. Unfortunately, I have no idea how effective these are due to the game being fresh and all. Onwards we can also use cash currency to exchange it to EXP which used for researching upgrades and higher ship tiers and silver.  Alright we got that over with, Should you play Steel Ocean?  Certainly it's worth a try but in it's current state, there are alot of tweaking that needs to be made. if you don't want to go through the hassle, you might wanna steer clear and play World of warship instead.",

I would definitely recommend this game for two primary reasons: 1) We need more players -there is no harm in slightly faster matchmaking and larger matches. 2) The game is free to play -I make a point never to spend outside currency on games, and many free to play games can take years to get to a goal without utilizing microtransactions. Steel Ocean does have microtransactions as well, but they are only for customizing ships (paint and flags) and buying higher tier ships without unlocking them. However, the reward for using this currency (gold) is really unnecessary and the game is therefore not pay-to-win. Steel Ocean is an excellent game that can set itself apart from other games that are similar. Give it a try.",

            "review_text": "Alright, so I've played a decent amount of both this and World of Warships, and have one primary thing to say: all those guys who say this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ knockoff of WoWs can shove it. Yes, the two games are similar, but there are plenty of things that this game does better than WoWs.  First, the aiming sytem. In Wows, all you have is this weird square thing for a reticle, and you may as well be firing blind with the way your shots scatter. However, Steel Ocean has an aim system that is almost identicle to World of Tanks, surprisingly enough. It gives you an scatter circle that is affected by ship movement and turret rotation, so you can actually see where your shots might land. In addition, battleships, which are essentially artillery, can use an eagle eye view to aim their shots over greater distances.  Second, the weapons. In WoWs, everything other than primary artillery and torpedoes is computer controlled, with no input from the player. Steel Ocean gives control of everything other than anti-air machine guns to the player, meaning flak cannons and main and secondary artillery. This allows for a more dynamic play style (and the ability to actually shoot down planes).  Third, the ships. In WoWs, the primary thing I found I hated was that somehow, cruisers could easily outrange battleships, making battleships a much less viable class. However, I feel that not only are classes better defined, there are more of them. First off are destroyers. They act as scouts and sub hunters. They are fast, manueverable, and armed with torpedoes and fast-firing artillery, but the artillery doesn't do much damage and they have low armor. Second is subs. This is a class that Wargaming refused to put in WOWs, saying it wouldnt work. Well guess what, it does. Subs act as scouts and assassin units, and are a hard counter to battleships and carriers. They are able to submerge and cna only be hit with torpedoes or depth charges, but as a balance have to surface periodically or risk running out of air and drowning. Third are cruisers, which are split into two more classes, light and heavy. Light cruisers are better armed and armoured destroyers, but sacrifice some speed and manueverability. Heavy cruisers go a little further in the loss and gains. Both classes are meant to deal with destroyers and other cruisers, and sometimes subs, and have powerful spotting equipment. Fourth are everyone's favorite, the battleship. Battleships are your heavy-hitting artillery, sitting back from the front lines and hammering away at the enemy from a distance with their superior range and firepower. They are also able to utilize an overhead view of the battlefield, similar to artillery in WoTs. While they are capable of taking a major beating, they lack manueverability and sonar, making they vulnerable to subs and destroyers that get close. Last is the carriers. Aircraft carriers are the support class, and can almost always be found hiding in a corner of the map. Capable of deploying scouts, fighters, dive bombers, and torpedoe bombers, a skilled CV player can certainly carry a team (pun intended). However, carriers are also extremely vulnerable, making protecting them a neccesity, as they make for great target practice.  Now, I will admit that the quene time for matches is incredibly long, but that is primarily due to the small player base this game has, lacking the advertising that WoWs and WoTs have. Matchmaking could definitly use some work, but same could be said for a lot of PvP games. While the ships and turrets are far more manueverable than they should probably be, this also allows for faster-paced gameplay and strategy.  In the end, all I can realy say is that this game has a lot of elements that Wargaming could defenitely use in World of Warships, but it isnt perfect.",

A large and growing base of different ships to choose from along with colour schemes and flags (if you are willing to pay a little extra for the latter two) with their own unique weaknesses and strengths. And apart from World of Warships there is also submarines which could be a real pain if you are playing as a capital ship whereas unless you are a true ace on dodging torpedoes you might come across something of a hard time against them if your lighter ships, ergo destroyers and cruisers don't sink them for you of course. I mean, what is not to like about a decent game where you get to sink massive ships(!?) and is fairly realistic in terms of ballistics and whatnot.   TLDR: Me likey.

First off I want to say you get free Gold sometime for completing stuff etc. to buy XP or convert gold for coins and so on.  The game has some features I like:   +The Guns accuracy: The guns are only accurate if you leave them locked in for a few seconds, if you move them they have to adjust again.  +Submarines, SUBMARINES! I think that speaks for itself. Even though they are kinda hard to play.  +Aircraftcarriers: You can adjust your plane setup as much as you want it to be, not like in WOWs where you have pregiven setups.  + You can control: Main battery, AA GUNS, Torpedoes (Fire one at a time). You can also drop underwater charges from a cruiser to give submarines a hard time. Only Machineguns are controlled by AI.  +More things to research.  + Customization for ingame Cash -&gt; Lasts only for 7 Days but its not that expensive if you are good player. I think 12k for a camo, thats not much.  + The Grind: Grinding isnt a pain in the a** that much, it becomes harder if you go up the Tiers and thats good in my opinion because you keep a ship longer and learn more about it's strenghtes and weaknesses.  + Runs good on weaker PC's, much adjustment to the graphics can be done.   Theres more, find out for yourself, but every good game brings negative aspects with it.   - Physics: The ships accelerate to fast and stop to fast, the weight of the Ships is not to much of a factor yet.  - Shipclasses: The Battleships are crushing right now, the main guns shred everything, hope it's going to be nerfed.  - Matchmaking: Because many people play Battleships right now or Submarines in lower tiers, the matchmaking becomes odd sometimes but you never play with Ships that are higher than 2 Tiers, except you play with a friend who is Tier 3 when you are Tier 1.  - Performance: With some things in the graphics the performance gets kind of bad, the FPS drop down to 20, the game isn't very old so it's more of a 'hopefully gets fixed' negative point.  - No European server, normally american server is no problem for me, if my internet has a bad day, I am unable to play but same as above, they will most likely work on that.   These are my main points I want to Stick out to the people thinking about getting the game, it's for free and the dev's are working constantly on it, so give it a shot.   In the end I can say that this game surprised me in a positive way and I think there is much to come.",

Most times we just divide into 2 groups, or jump into another game that we can enjoy together. I must say this,... SO, is a running contender to WoWs, which we played before, I ran into this game, which we tend to like as a whole, better. But, that waiting for a match for a 4 or more member group matchmaking is pretty bad, considering that it feels like alot of good play time is lost in waiting. Actual play time vs that wait time. Which is longer?   2) Subs should have more than just two depth layers. If I'm not mistaken, Some subs had the potential to dive deeper than depth charges, but at some risk. Some DD and Light Cruisers are too Op for Subs. From what I've noticed in playing this game (SO), is that it takes more than two hits (torps or arts to sink any other vessel. But when it comes to Subs and depth charges, it appears to take only one hit. I Feel that maybe the Subs (or some Subs) need a little more speed to balance this out, if not more evasive depth.    PS. It would be cool in some maps to have larger Ocean swells. Rock the boat,... Baby!",

Even though I was the Game was a lightly slower pace and that the boats handled a little less like land bassed vehicles orvall it is a fun experience so far.   Pros -More variety for vehicles types and therefore ways to play as well -Crew gives you helpfull info when they speak the majority of the time, such as pen\\ no pen or when specfic modules are knocked out or damaged  -Fire is not the main killer or dmg dealer of your boat like it is in WOWS which some boats are just broken with their ability to spam HE to kill everything alive through derp dmg or the fire from Satans inferno aparently -Ammo is not unlimited so especially with torps its not just about spamming them all over the place beace they can be both expensive and very limited yet still powerfull so care needs to be taken when using them. -Torps are visable from the moment they are launched so spotting them isnt based off of some invisable RNG that comes out of nowhere. - Torps also have a more substantialy are time for them to be ale to dmg boats and also have a larger relavtive range thatn in WOWS but since you can always see them dodging is usually an option or at least bracing for impcat if dodging is not an option - Using secondary guns and AA is usually pretty fun and normally always gives you something to do instead off waiting for reloads. -AA weapons also make it nice so taking out planes isnt total luck or a random slaughter and even though some AA is automatic if you arent engaged with another boat you can choose to engage Aircraft to protect yourself and others. -Carriers are a bit different that WOWS as well since you cant run out of planes but instead generate them over time so even if some do get destroyed wait a little bit and you can call out moreand planes have fuel to keep an eye on. - Carrier groups are also nice since you can call out whatever type of plane you need for the situation as oppsed to WOWS where some you only have fighters or only bombers since here is doenst happen like that - Port slots are pretty cheap like $1 a slot or even less if you buy more gold at a time. -Boats collisions are fantastic! Suprised how good the physics and sounds for that are! -Tutorial does a reasonable job explainging mechanics and let you try higher tier boats. -Anyone can use smoke to conceal movement, not restricted by boat type.  Cons  -Premium Boats do appear to be on the more expensive side but maybe the price will change after a while. - There is a premium ammo that can be purchased with gold that has slightley more dmg and penetration but it is a very skight upgrade and the way accuracy works in this game I would bet more shells would land in the water than anything plus they do take up space since you can only carry so much ammo. - Graphics arent great but always something that can be improved over time especially since the mechanics are more than solid enough. - Some of the UI elemnts do look kinda cheesy and cheap but again always something that can be improved upon over time so no biggie there.  From about 12 hours of playtime so far and will update as I notice more pro's and con's  But so far I do say it is a different enough experience to be worth time invested into.  ",

The graphics aren't particularly pretty, but the gameplay is fantastic.  I feel the UI for managing your ships' officers could use a bit of work though, but aside from that, all of the other issues I've had with the game have been niggling at worst.   There's a huge amount of ships to choose from, and judging from the patch notes, they're continuing to add more. Furthermore, all of the ships seem to be relatively balanced in the sense that DDs don't feel inferior or superior to BBs since they serve a different tactical function. Also, in combat with each other, torpedoes hurt... a lot.   Although I haven't played much, the matchmaking system seems really good. As opposed to players being divided purely by ELO, they're divided by ship classes. So, both sides will have the same number of DDs, SSs, CVs, etc... which makes a HUGE difference given that every ship class has its own inherent strengths and weaknesses (you will never have the horrible fate of a full team of SSs vs BBs/CVs).  All in all I'm glad I found out about this game and am looking forward to seeing it get updated.  EDIT: Can't tell if the community is just dead or if the matchmaking is just wonky lately, but there seems to be some odd matchmaking setups i.e. 3 SS + 1 CV, 4BB, 1CL + 2SS. As a result, the game isn't quite as fun as it could be. Honestly I wouldn't mind being placed against ships of a much higher tier at this point if it means more ship diversity (especially considering the timeline of WW2, such engagements did happen). I'd prefer both tier and ship class to be taken into account with matchmaking if they do that though. So, for example, not only are there 3 DDs, 1 CA, 1CV, 2BB on each side, but also 1 Tier 2, 3 Tier 3s, 2 Tier 4s, and 1 Tier 5",

The game offer much enjoyable arcade gameplay experince than WoWs, the game is also a lot more complex than simple minded WoWS.   Pros+ 1. full control over you ships everysingle weapon and support system can be used, while WoWs only have very limited control over you ship, for example battleships in WoWS only have main guns, but in this game you get to manually use the secondary and AA guns. 2. More ships in game for each nation and more nations 3. Submarine 4. larger load out customization options. 5. Night battle.  Cons- 1. Poor optimization, for a game that use a old Engine (Unreal Engine 3) there should be no excuse for that. 2. Dated graphics. 3. Certain Pay 2 win elements.",

Complaining about someone suiciding on your team? Can't. Suicide is a bad word. Want to complain about passive-aggressive behavior? Good luck: Passive is a bad word... because it contains '♥♥♥'. Absurdity reaches a pitched fever when you try to describe a map in a  naval warfare  game and it pukes on you for using the word 'canal'. Not that this is any of a surprise... China is good at exactly two things: Censoring the **** out of everything and producing lead-infused childrens' toys.  Which leads me to the game itself:  The gameplay itself is about as fun as lead poisoning . The map selection is small. Submarines and carriers are severely underpowered, and battleships can be easily sunk by one or two torpedoes... as long as you spend money to get the gold-plated versions. Regular versions require about 4 torpedoes to sink one. And destroyers and cruisers can launch 4-8 of these, so you're still pretty screwed even without the Credit Card Ultimate Upgrade(tm).   The carriers are cursed with planes that are easily shot down, can be seen at over three times the distance they can spot at, and as a courtesy, fly low, slow, and in straight lines or hopelessly long and predictable semi-circles. And the torpedo-dropping ones even helpfully do a full circle about the release point before dropping most of the time. Basically, you have to be asleep at the keyboard to be damaged by a plane, and this assumes you didn't faceplant onto the 'W' key and aren't completely stationary. Even at that, you can expect to only have your planes hit the target about half the time. Unless you spend money, in which case all of these problems go away and you're gifted with planes that fly fast, have 21st century stealth technology, and shoot lasers. Okay, I'm lying about the lasers... but the damage they put out makes you wish it did... a single gold-plated torpedo could probably take out a small island.   I could go on, but I think you get the point: It suffers from terrible balance issues, and feels like a cheap knock-off of world of tanks, but with ships. Which, well, you know...  China . Even assuming you like the game, you're going to be in a league of your own: There's only about 300 or so people on the server in the evenings, so if you advance far enough in the game to have decent ships, you'll be staring at a loading screen forever. And, if you don't advance far enough, you'll die to some guy with money to burn who will sink you with his credit card, because at the lower tiers, skill is pretty irrelevant. But, if you do decide to play the game, do yourself a favor: Don't ever type anything in the game. Because sooner or later, the filter will trip, and if you spend any time at all chatting, you'll probably get a moderator (or a script; I'm not sure how it happens, I just see a lot of complaints outside of the game) to mute you. Maybe they're just practicing for their future job getting paid ten cents and a cracker to build the great firewall of China, I don't know.   If you appreciate this sarcastic and brutally honest review, give me a thumbs up. If you didn't appreciate it, you're probably on the phone to steam support and I have no idea what you're saying because there's no subtitles... but I can guess it's something to the effect of mumble mumble help help I'm being oppressed mumble. So thanks, China. You've made me proud to be an American... where at least our sh*tty games don't suffer from a pathological need to oppress its own players. Cheers!   ",

So far I'm still waiting for the devs to give me a response. Aside from that, and from what I've seen, it's very poorly optimized, the game takes ages to load (in my case it took roughly three times more than WoWS) and, considering its graphics are far from impressive, that's such a massive drawback and it just doesn't make me want to even try it out. Would write about the gameplay, if I could get to play the actual damn game. For now it gets a no-no/10 from me. I don't deny that it has quite a lot of potential though, but we'll have to wait and see.  [EDIT]  Ok, the problem seems to be solved, so... after playing a couple matches, I still hold my point. The game's optimization is absolutely terrible, for some reason there are some specific moments when it freezes for some seconds (switching to depth charges and closing the scouting vision, just to name a few). It's a bit laggy and since it still is fairly new there aren't many players so the queue times are quite long, but it has its charm. The controls are fine, though there are some things that could use some adjustment, such as the lock-on system for main guns (the camera not resetting to where your guns are aiming is kind of a bummer). For some reason I can't get used to the camera being placed just above the water when you're trying to aim your side guns, which ends up tunnel-visioning your line of sight a bit and makes it very awkward to do so.  Anyway, these are all things that I, personally, can't get used to and, as a WoWS player, I can't imagine why the devs would think of making some controls and mechanics so different from one game to the other. So I don't understand why there must be so many differences between WoWS and SO control-wise, since that's usually the first thing that scares off new players (and, with that, potential customers). It still has many interesting stuff going on, the subs, the different firing modes and so. Artistically speaking, the music is also excellent and there're a lot of details put into every ship, even if the poor graphics kinda destroy the whole purpose.  I might continue playing it since it really has tons of potential, this can get to be a great nautical warfare game, we'll just have to give it some time and wait for the community to grow big enough.",

Every single match you have to fight against those Dark Judge players with 5000+ matches experience and all the golden shells &amp; smokes &amp; paints perfectly setup, waiting to tear you into parts. Sure, I am not as good, but I don't want to fight players that are obviously not at the same level, and any legitimate MMO games should not do so. However, if you spread the good players &amp; bad players equally among two sides, that will be fine because although one team there's a huge spread of skill brackets, but at the end the two teams are nearly equal. However, this is not the case at top tiers battles. So usually those 5000+ top players tend to queue in as a 3 or 2 people group, but since there aren't that many players, sometimes there would be only 3 V 3 fights at those top tiers, meaning that they are MOSTLY against you, and you never get a chance to win. So after over 500+ hours of torture, f*ck this sh*t, dead game, go to hell :)  Btw 500 hours seem quite a lot, but that just count as about 2000 games played, this is the level where you just get an entrance ticket to those top tiers fights, and just start to feel the pain.",

Hard to describe what exactly went wrong, it just doesn't feel right.  Judging by the interface, I'd say it's a copycat of Battle Station: Pacific. It just reminds me so much of that game, everything seems to be exactly the same. The whole thing just feels like they brought BS:P back to life and mix-breed with WoT which is actually the fun part of the game.   What pisses me off the most is, if they're copying an old classic, they shoul atleast make it look better, with a more decent graphic and interface, after all, that game they're copying is published 6 years ago.

Not a slight feeling of sailing any ship, its like driving tank on water.  And the worst thing is  PAY TO WIN , you want any gold consumable and good crew? yes spend real money. And did I mention this game have a gatcha system? well yes, its on your luck to get a rare commander.  Seriously this game is a joke, go play World of Warships.",

Pros: -Pretty easy firing mode (circles that get smaller the more to calm your movement and speed) - Pretty big tech Tree - Everyone seems to be on the same level as you  Cons: - The graphics are kinda bad compared to WOW - Its like a ghetto WOW  I dont know its a nice concept but its just an uglier version of WOW. Like if they were to add some of the things from here that would be cool. Well honestly maybe just the subs everything else was kinda dumb. I dont get how you can have a birds eye view of your enemy whos far away. The aiming is kinda for dumb people. It like gets smaller and makes it easy for people to aim and shoot. I feel like you have to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to need something like that. Oh and the graphics are ♥♥♥♥. Imagine putting WOW on a 1360x769 resolution when you have a 4k monitor. Its just plain ugly.",
