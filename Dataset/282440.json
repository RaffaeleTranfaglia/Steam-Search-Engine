            "review_text": "Over the past 6 years I've spent more time playing QL than any other game which comes out to an absurd amount of hours in-game. I'll do my best to summarize the experience and why you should definitely consider getting into it.  A few things you should know before you get into Quake:   1) This game is the most difficult FPS you will ever play. The core mechanics are easy to understand and it's simple enough to grab a weapon and start shooting so the mantra 'easy to learn, hard to master' applies, however, The skill ceiling is so high that no matter how many years you pour into it, you'll never hit it. This quality makes Quake very daunting for core FPS audiences. Many of the pro tricks take months of practice in order to pull off at just an elementary level.  2) Even if you're really good, You're going to lose. A lot. Quake doesn't have an artificially level playing field like most modern games. Quick deaths and large spread fire hitscan weapons do not exist in the same fashion as Battlefield, COD, or just about any modern FPS series. If you are worse than the player you're up against you are going to lose. People who want undeserved wins or prefer the casual experience aren't going to feel comfortable in Quake Live. The people that play have stuck with it with aggressive loyalty because they have the mind-set of someone who enjoys learning something no matter how hard it is. You play because you can appreciate the skill that it takes to be good. In this way, losing in Quake is actually fun, in so far that you can appreciate the player's skill that you lost to.  3) Even with the recent modernization update, the game lacks certain casual nicities that gamers have become accustomed to. A list of some mechanics QL is missing: Regenerating Health, Headshots, Ridiculous amounts of Ammo, Instant kills, Standing still to limit weapon spread, Low speed cap on player movement, Stamina, Loss of velocity while jumping. These mechanics have become coliquially synonymous with the 'tactical' FPS. You'll find that the removal of these features actually promotes tactics a lot more than what you get from the Counter Strike or COD formula.  What is Quake about?  Item timing, Physics exploitation, Map control, Accuracy, Situational awareness, Reading your opponents, Setting traps, and Rockets everywhere.  Who will enjoy Quake Live?  Gamers that are okay with losing and can respect the reasons that they lost. Gamers that find it enjoyable to learn how the physics engine in their game works and how to take advantage of it. Gamers that don't like frags being handed to them because of a lucky shot.  If you spend the time to get familiar with Quake you'll find that it's the most rewarding experience there is in the FPS genre. When you first pull off the Bridge to Rail jump in Campgrounds you'll shriek with delight. When you win your first duel you'll giddily tell people who could care less about games about it. The better you get the more accomplished you feel and there is no end to how good of a player you can be. The pros are bested all the time by some new blood with ungodly talent and dedication.  If you put in the hours you'll also find one of the most loyal and dedicated communities that there are in gaming. There's sure to be an influx of typical gamer culture trolls in the first few weeks but the people that have stuck it out with Quake, I'm sure you'll find, are some of the most level-headed and respectful people out there.

I enjoy playing Quake Live. It's the most fun I've ever had playing a game, and the most I've ever played one specific game. It's easy to keep coming back to time and time again, because at the end of the day it's a pure Arena Shooter - every game starts on equal terms, and it's down to player skill how it goes. Loadout servers are the exception, but those servers are boring ;)  Some people are arguing that now the game costs money they'll just play Quake 3 instead, but Q3 is still rediculously overpriced on Steam. Buy this instead, and you'll actually be abl to play with people. If you're sitting on the fence, wait for it to go on sale.  This game's had it's problems, but it's a classic everyone should try it.

Let's first talk about that update. There was alot of discussion about it. The main topic is the new price, which is 10‚Ç¨. It was a bad move from Bethesda, just changing the price, thats for sure. But everybody who already had the game on Steam, keeps it in their library &amp; can still play it. Also the Premium feature got removed, which makes nobody have advantages. The update also gave us a full Steam Support &amp; making your own Server for you and your friends (which was a premium feature before). Also there was discussions about the removed Linux Support (Yeah, because so many people play on linux.). Im sorry about the people on Linux who can't play anymore.   So I personally think it's not that tragic and people are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing too much and giving inappropriate ratings about the game, which itself is very good and funny, especially if youre playing together with your friends.  I don't support the idea of making a game 10‚Ç¨, but in this case we got something else from that. And YES I recommend you buying this awesome game!",

            "review_text": "TL;DR There wont ever be a Arena FPS on the same level as Quake, RIP Unreal Tournament &amp; Arena Shooters in general.  Put simply, the Ultimate Game of Skill.   There's no easy way around it, no arguements to settle... simply no reason to disprove the statement above; because no other game offers the same mechanics like Quake does, arena shooter or otherwise. We can't even compare its age old rival Unreal Tournament, since that game has been chopped and changed throughout the years... its really just a cheap knockoff. (Not taking out UT99's Facing Worlds... excellent map) Quake's formula remains unchanged since its original incarnation and has stood the test of time.   And plus to compare any shooter to Quake is like comparing Apples to Oranges.   Quake is set apart from other FPS or Arena shooters by having a near perfect engine for precise control and movement, very efficient netcode carried over from the excellent netcode of Quake 3 means that the game feels like a LAN-Party even with 50-100 ping... however I don't recommend playing games over 100.   The gameplay also differs from the fact there's no random variables, no luck based elements involved. The entire game is set about by 'chance'... the chance that a rocket might hit... but that is all controlled by you the player, since every weapon has 100% accuracy and movement is considerably faster than any other FPS. There are no 'headshots' or easy kills, it simply doesn't exist and therefore does not hold your hand in the chance you 'may' get a random headshot as such. If someone kills you repeatedly its just a sign they're a far better player than you are.   This system allows people to play with consistency that isn't often seen in other games, you never really lose the skills you had in Quake... more likely people just get better than you are, the engine is timeless. There's also Map Control to consider, don't want to pick up items? Expect to respawn very quickly. You simply can't play the traditional gametypes successfully without trying to get the items on the map, you don't start with power weapons (loadouts are now an option thank god) and thus you're at a tremendous disadvantage the moment you spawn.   So with no easy entrance for beginners why do I recommend this game? Quake is the only game that offers a true 100% skill based Competitive Experience, the fact there's no random variables should be plainly obvious. Games like CSGO do have an excellent competitive community (though salty D:) , but there is always going to be a random element in the game. The Quake Community is truly amazing, do poorly in a game vs a better player... they'll critique you, give you tips etc... you get the odd elitist but the reception overall is awesome. :3  Also the new update is great imho... sure its Pay 2 Play... but so was Quake Live Premium and that was BS. If you had Quake Live on Steam beforehand you got it free... so why all the commotion?   Stands the Test of Time. 10/10  Edit 2016: Still one of my favourite games of all time, nothing has changed. :3",

I played it when it was F2P and on a browser and it was enjoyable and I loved every bit of it even though I was 12 and terrible at arena FPS. I recommend it to anyone that loves Old School Arena FPS. Although this game is brilliant, there is one issue I have : the community. The community is fading for this title, Im not sure about Q3A though. Because the small community many people that play this game are veterans of Q3A and new players like myself, are not really welcome. I have played a few Clan Arena games ( which is my favourite gamemode) and although I understand how to play the game I can never get kills. Many of the people playing were skilled and were toxic towards me becasue I was so bad at the game. No matter how many times I told them I want to play this game for fun, I would get insta kicked. What I would want ( even though many would disagree) is to create a ranking system and have servers as well as dedicated servers. The ranking system should not be complex, it should simply be 3 levels : Initiate( new player), intermediate ( average or better than newbie) and Skilled ( pro players and veterans). By doing this new players will be less likely to leave or get kicked by pros and will be able to stand a chance against similar skill groups. This is just an idea.

And let me say that Steam did it a good deal by taking it over, all together removing subscriptions for 'premium' which only gave maps. And only maps. As well as a private server. So by taking away a crippling payment system for the F2P on steam, they made it P2P for those who didn't switch and kept it for those who did, simply because it was in their library. However, the only negative effect was on the Game Mode, making you pick up weapons instead of getting the full onslaught at spawn with one to pick from. But the updates brought VAC, Code Patches, and updated UI that didn't rely on web-pages, Unicode goods, and many more improvements by Valve which are overlooked for a measly 10$. And for what? Because a child can't ask ma for something? Things that are free aren't always going to remain that way, and I enjoyed this a lot, even with a few negatives, the positives outweigh them immensely.   So let me explain this: It isn't hat fortress 2. It isn't Half Life. It isn't Any CSGO, it's equal. No money, No bomb, No class loadouts, No classes, No added buffs, nerfs, or differntiations of the SAME WEAPONS.   Now let me be even more blunt: This is a game where you die. And you survive. You spawn, pick up your gun, and focus as hard as you can to kill your opponents, and take top score. And here's a trick: They're all gods. They've mastered the game. I played Quake 2 and 3 when I was little, and they couldnt prepare me for the head to head, player armed combat this has. Rocket Jumping, Rail lodging, and painstaking, rage inducing hours lie ahead of you. And if you want to even be remotely good, practice with the gods. Die, take the fall, and keep going. This game is all about knowing who your opponent is. Listening to each movement, sound, and shot. From Shotguns, to Plasma Guns, to the infamous 'Sniper's Wet Dream,' The Railgun, and even the classic Rocket Launcher, you're at no excuse to say 'They're cheating' or 'They have better weapons' because they're just like yours. It's YOU who sucks in this case.   So put down that stupid little credit card you used for TF2 and CS:GO, and get on equal playing grounds. It's time that you boast your skills by doing two things: Nut up, Or Shut up. That's what you get with Quake Live. Your move.",

Quake 3 arena on your browser with multiplayer capabilities. This was absolutely mindblowing. You could see your stats and how well you compared with other players around the globe. Sure I lost duel matches here and there because guess what? It was one of the few games that took skill to play. sank hours into it. It was a great experience. Free for all was a blast to play.  Quake live eventually came to steam, so I download it, and then come to suprise after joining another FFA game......LOADOUTS.  Seriously, loadouts? this wasn't call of halo: battle strike 14. not so characteristic of an arena shooter man....If i wanted a game with loadouts, i'd be playing Call of duty. However, I didn't want to play Call of Duty. I wanted to play Quake. leave that loadout ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in military shooter.   the problems with the loadouts here is that it removes the point of actively searching for fixed weapon/item spawn points throughout the level when you now can just get two weapons you pick from the menu before spawning. This sort of thing is one of the most controversial additions to the game. They wanted Quake Live to be more open to newcomers but that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• didn't really work out too well. I look at loadouts as a shortcut and that won't help you learn locations of important weaonry and other needed items, kind of like training for duel matches.  universal ammo boxes? ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off. it ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing happened as well. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s. this little piece of box refills your entire ammunition supply, so no more individual ammo types to find.  Useless auto jump? useless as described. WTF is the point of this? It's not really strafe-jumping at all so you're just jumping around like an idiot while everyone else who knows how to strafe jump are all over the place.  So what you get now is a heavily modified version of Quake 3 arena with new maps, game modes and that's it for a low, low price of 9 dollars, which isn't the problem here at all. There is no ranking...and this game could do with a major visual overhaul, someething like CSGO did, made that game look and feel modern style....not that it matters anyway because a Quake veteran plays on the lowest graphics setting to achieve the most frames per second, so as soon as they see you as a bright green enemy player model and you haven't done a damn thing in the match, that's it, you're ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing dead. there is no 'Hey, I saw him first=kill' ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t like on CSGO. If you know how to play, how the weapon work, timing with item spawns,ect, you're good to go. If you don't, you're a dead man. So dedication is important for Quake Live if you want to have fun.  That's duel mode for you. that is the only game mode that wasn't molested with modern features so if you go on that game mode, prepare to fight, otherwise get the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out because the other seasoned players will make hamburger meat out of you in 2 seconds.  This whole loadout thing happened because during a past press conference or whatever, Id soft basically said that they wanted to open this up to a newer audience by adding these changes to the game. in english, they wanted to cater to the casual player market, but in doing so, alienates the core veteran base of Quake live while most modern players will find this game mediocre at best since these features are now the new default settings. this was not a very good development decision in my opinion.    Quake Live is NOT a modern military shooter, so why make these changes? it makes no sense. I had to bust my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on this game to get somewhat decent back in the day, and even that wasn't enough because I still went 0-32 in a duel match because I simply wasn't on this game 24/7, 12 months of the year. Free for all was my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but with the loadouts and all that nonsense in the way, it's just not fun anymore. There's nothing making you want or need to navigate through the maps to find weapons and armor while killing other players, which was the main point of the game.   So unless you want to be only playing freezetag, I wouldn't recommend getting this game because that's the only mode people are playing. Also, since Bethesda and Id software don't support this game and there are no official servers so it's all community-based server locations. don't be suprised when you don't get good ping during gameplay. Only time will tell when this game finally dies off, as if it's on life support or something. I'm starting to see less of this game anytime e-sports is mentioned.  To top it all off, Quake Live is on life support or something, so don't expect good ping on most of the servers depending where you live....even CSGO has better connection 90 percent of the time, which is astounding.     I'm done with Id soft.  This game is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing mess.   But I'll tell you what. You want a game with zero ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t included in your steak order and also the meat is real and not something mixed in a blender like from the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• mcdonalds menu? A well-done steak with that A1 sauce? There is a game on steam here if you didn't know called 'Reflex', it's an arena fps based on the Challenge pro mode mod that was originally made for Quake 3 Arena to help make the game much more fluid and competive with better weapon behavior, balanced maps, ect but Reflex aims to be a much more modern version of Quake 3, recently made maps done by the community, get random prizes similiar in the CSGO or TF2 fasion for your robot. there is an Xp bar but that doesn't do anything for you other than showing, hey' you are seasoned player, not because your weapons will deal more damage or your armor is better than everyone else's. Sure the playerbase is small but with your enthusiasm for the arena shooter genre, Reflex is sure to blow this Quake JIVE out of the water...and it probably has already for that matter.  Also, since I'm just throwing my two cents out there and judging by the abomination they call 'Halo 4 2016 multiplayer', don't get your hopes up for Quake: Champions which will most likely be an Overwatch clone since the characters are dubbed as 'champions' and each individual will also have their starting loadout and abilities, so with that theory in place, if you are looking for a classic, Quake 3 style arena shooter gameplay, you can kiss that goodbye because Id software has become bethesda's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and they're doing new things now.   gay sex maybe, i don't know.   Verdict: 2/10",

The games mechanics are very unforgiving towards mistakes, and every aspect requires pixel precision.  So as you have probably guessed, the skill level is very high, so expect to get beaten a lot if you are new. The game is easy to get into, but very difficult to master. However, due to being around for so long there are plenty of tutorials and demos online to help.  Visually the game is still acceptable after 15 years, and can be maxed out to look quite nice.  It is still immensely popular, for there is a lack of shooters of this nature. Developers tend to favor easy games that appeal to the mass market/lowest common denominator, and until that changes, quake live is here to stay.

Ultimately, given that 86% have said 'yes', I think that percentage is a little too high and visible right now, so that's a 'no' from me.",

I went over there and the door was unlocked so I went right in. Sure enough there was my neighbor and two of his friends smoking to their hearts content. I told them they had two options, one- they could put the joints out or two- I would put the joints out for them. My neighbor had run ins with me before so he knew I meant business so he threw his joint down and told me to leave. I said you made a wise choice but I‚Äôm still calling the cops and then I turned to leave. My neighbor then got up off the couch got behind me and said a few cuss words and told me to mind my business. Well that did it. I turned around, took off my shades, looked him straight in the eye and said ‚Äúlets get high‚Äù. I then front kicked him a good 8 feet in the air. Then his other friend came at me with the bong, I grabbed his arm, snapped it and then hit him in the stomach with the bong. His other friend ran into the kitchen so I went after him. He was in the corner crying so I said ‚Äúthis is your brain‚Äù and then I grabbed a frying pan and said ‚Äúthis is your brain on drugs‚Äù and then I hit him in the head as hard as I could with the frying pan. After that I called the cops and they came over and arrested my neighbor and his friends. As I was leaving the sarge shouted out to me thanks. I turned around, took off my shades, looked him straight in the eye and said ‚Äù well you know sarge, perhaps if we build a freaking dunkin doughnuts on this street it would give you guys a excuse to ride up here once or twice a week and keep the crime down. I then threw my shades on the ground to let him know I meant business. I feel pretty good about what I did for my neighborhood today.",

Many of todays fps games such as Half-Life and Call of Duty forexmaple, also use the Quake engine that Quake 1 introduced. Now enough about that. . From since 1996, Quake has been the most respected fps out there and has also been pretty much the most difficult one to learn. All todays call of battlefields don't stand a chance in a fight with Quake. Why? Because Quake never hold your hand and that was always the thing, until now..  2014 and Quake Live. Quake Live is basically call of live. This game ain't Quake anymore as it has all kinds of streamlining to make it less Quake and more like the todays console fps instead. This thing doesn't respect the history at all and instead it added weaponloadouts. That is something that's totally against the way Quake works. It has visible timers on items, universal ammo, faster movement speed with Gauntlet... This release changed the core game mechanics like many damage ratios of the weapons. Some weapons were made less powerful and some more powerful. Now this is something that you will never do to an legend. This game is not your generic call of battlefield, this is Quake for gosh sakes. Epic announcer was also replaced by someguy who tries so hard and yet doesn't even come close to sounding acceptable.  Game is also very broken. My friend couldn't even connect to the game at all as it just gave him an error screen and i couldn't connect once at all either. Though luckily it resolved for me in matter of seconds, but not for my friend sadly.  The game menu system is broken. You click on an object and nothing happens. I actually discovered this but it's a clear bug. To get the system to work, you have to click it again. So if i click 'browse games', nothing happends. Now if i click it again after a split sec then it accepts it. Another thing is the options menu for controls. This game does not register my mouse scrollwheel for some reason. It has default next weapon as 'scroll down' but i tried to change it and even add scroll up to 'next weapon' and the game just ignored it.  I don't recommend this awful garbagepile ever as now this thing is just closer to the modern console fps than it is to being a Quake game anymore. You remember, the important one that created 3D Deathmatch games in 1996? Next update will probably even introduce regenerating health and ironsight aiming. Yeah, just don't play this..",

They fixed Eyefinity support, which is always nice and you can also now set a custom resulotion with windowed mode, which can be handy, because Eyefinity support is pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•...  The need of a Quake Live account is still there, which is probably one of the wort things about this game... It still uses Steam for multiplayer and stuff, so you can still just join your friends like that, so why does it need an Quake Live account? No idea...  Other than that... Well, it's Quake... Dunno what more to say :P Feels a lot like Quake 3, except you can choose what weapons to start with and stuffs. Just feels kinda weird to me...  Could also be great if it had some sort of tutorial... Got kinda confused with gamemodes like freeze tag and stuff at first...  After they have fixed the game, I can now finally recommend it! Give it a try, it's worth it! I'll give it 6/10, good to be f2p!  -- Original review below --  I played it way back before it was on Steam and everything and when you needed to do ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in your browser to get it running and all that. I kinda liked it back then. It was ok. Nothing really too special.  So, what has happened over this time and since the release on Steam? Basiclly, nothing really. You still need a Quake Live account and it just feels like it hasn't aged very well. Widescreen support is horrible and it crashed my entire PC the first time I started it up. I don't know what's up with that...  Also, no Eyefinity/Multi-Monitor support and windowed mode only goes to 1024x768!  So... this is basiclly a poor-mans version of Quake 3... Get Quake 3 if you can!  Overall this game gets 4/10, Since it's f2p you can give it a shot if you feel like it, but it's pretty meh.",

I was a little disappointed with the lack of gore, as in the original Quake 3 instead of bursting into particles of light, you literally are gibbed with your blood and guts spilling everywhere. I didn't mind that too much, however as the gameplay was still true to the original Quake.  They slowly and slowly added things that would make the game worse, like forced player-models (although it can be revised, they still remained all the same colour) and pay-to-play membership for extra perks, game modes and maps to play.  The Steam release is by far the absolute WORST thing to happen to this game, which is now INCREDIBLY spoonfed and ruined. The amount of skill required is now considerably less now that you can literally pick any two weapons to spawn with, completely ruining the element of racing to weapons first and who's the better strafer or bunnyhopper.   Pick-ups and power-ups now have a visible timer so you can camp them... This shouldn't be. You used to have to remember how long it's been, and now more spoonfeeding is introduced by showing you how much longer until, so every god damn player just camps quad damage now.  The announcer, once a deep, booming and chilling voice is now replaced with an unlikable, disgustingly acted celebrity-esqe voice that sounds like he's getting a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.   Zenimax or who-ever-the-hell made this game butchered quite terribly.

Its impossible to aquire a killstreak without passing the immense learning curve the game is legendary for. The only reason i have any luck at all in this game is because i used to play bots alot on dreamcast and 4 player deathmatch. Im telling you you will find no easy killstreak and if you do as sson as its given to you it is taken away in a second. YOu will not get lucky like that so often until you aquire a good amount of skill. So thats why i think even with all the newfeatures added supposedly for noobs its till gonna kick there asses and possibly might turn of newplayers because like i said before this game is all about skill. The only thing ican give it one point down for is they removed the awesome gore it had from the dreamcast and pc versions. Its impossible to give any negative reviews about this game you can always buy the older versions if you cant stand the new features but i think people pay for the subscription because they love quake and it makes it easy like xbox live to get into clans and al those community features.",

In fact, it's pretty good. A simple, straight forwarded FPS. Just what I wanted.  So why the downvote you ask?  The same reason I could give you for many PvP games: The community is cancerous. For a game that's around for so long that actually surprised me. The community seemingly despises beginners and you get kicked/banned the moment you're not in perfect harmony with their ridiculous values. Well fine, if you want to gather like-minded fools around you, I won't disturb you. I'll just take back my money and invest it into something worth bothering with. If I had plenty of friends around to play some private matches every now and then, that could be still fun. But since I don't happen to have friends who are actively playing QL and bots are not really interesting either, this game has nothing to offer to me.

            "review_text": "Having grown up playing online shooters such as Quake, you could understand how excited I was with the launch of Quake Live on Steam. I would consider myself a shooter fanatic, always playing the shooters that deserve my time, and skill. Quake, a simple, and fast paced shooter has become now a daily part of my life, only after a short relese of 2 days, and i'm sure i'll be back for more.  The game isn't all great, though. The classic Quake experience of knowing the map, times of weapon spwans, and even how much damage a gun will do to a un-armored and armored foe is totally swept away with many complexitys of Quake in Quake Live. A normal game allows loadouts, a putrid system for a game like Quake to have, while it also ruins the learning curve and challenge to many aspects of the game. For example, having not played Quake in years, I hopped in with the intent of rushing to the rocket launcher (a powerful weapon if controled accurately in the game) to only be surprised that in the menu, the option to start with ANY weapon in the games arsenal was available. Instantly my respect for players on higher end streaks was diminished, and the knowledge that any average joe could hop on and vaporize me with a railgun, was totally possible made the game suddenly alot less fun. I REALLY advice against this gameplay even if you are a begginer, Quake only makes itself into another generic FPS title that feels the need to compete, when it doesnt, it is better in almost all rights comnpared to other titles (ahem Call of Duty).  But my critism aside, gamemodes outside of the basic one are available, and the classic game modes and duels were ALL available here, to my relief. I find most of my time spent in Quake is the duel mode, 1v1 intense combat, knowing when weapons will spawn, and that my only hope of winning, is between me, and a super powerful laser gun. Not many games today do what Quake does, or offers such a simply unique, and simple experince that not only is fun to play, but is also very challenging. In fact, I beleive we may have a contender for the best FTP shooter this year, and certainly one of the best on steam currently. If you are a shooter fan of any kind, I highly recommend Quake Live.",

It's incredible that a game this old (15 years! that's half my age!) has such a huge fan base now, all thanks to Steam. Servers are full and people are having loads of fun. To be honest, I didn't know QL even existed and I doubt that many people did. Who ever thought it would be a good idea to put this on Steam deserves a Nobel Prize.  QL stays very true to Q3A, in that the graphics are the same, the sounds are (mostly, except for the announcer) the same, and most importanly the speed, pace and feel of the game are the same. I just came back from my first two rounds of Free-for-All, and I'm pumped.  The one thing that immediately made me go 'oh, ok... but wow!' was the fact that you get to pick your first two weapons now, instead of starting with the standard machine gun. They both come with a moderate amount of ammo, just to get you going again: it means you don't have to start hunting for a weapon before you set out to find your first victim. And that anyone who spawns near you is a real threat.  Another change is that all ammo packs now give you ammo for any weapon you are currently holding: if you're holding a Lightning Gun you get lightning ammo, if you're holding a Rocket Launcher you get rockets, etc. (although I'm not sure if this is also true for the BFG). It makes it easier to keep using you favourite weapons. Fortunately, the weapons are balanced enough (read: powered down) to make this fair. And if you still happen to run out of ammo, you can always use your trusty Gauntlet for a nice, humiliating melee kill.  There are other (but minor) gameplay changes as well, e.g.: you can see how much damage points you're dealing; powerups show their respawn time; there's a new green armour for 25 armour points.  One change I do not like but can accept is that there are no more 'gibs' and gore (blood splatter) animations. It would have been nice to be able to turn these on, just to make it worth that extra rocket you fired at your opponent after he was already dead.  I was really cautious to install this 'Free to Play' game, but thank god this one really is free to play in the normal sense of the word. You can, but absolutely genuinely positively do not have to pay any money what so ever. But you'll want to, just to support the developers and enable them to keep supporting this awesome retro-neo title.    Sadly, I have to end this review with a couple of notes to the developer:  1. A euro is not the same as a dollar 2. A dollar is not the same as a euro 3. ??? 4. Profit!",

I have to say that I wish the Load outs werent added. It is interesting sometimes, but usally just very anoying. Also I have to say that damn Lightning gun is to powerful, Anyway the new features are cool as it lets you spawn with your choice weapons. Still though I liked it when you started off with nothing and have to find a good gun. Felt like it took more skill to be able to move fast enough to get properly armed.   Anyway still great, definatly play this. The free version has almost all features. It is only missing stuff like voting on next map, running your own server. and a few friend items.

            "review_text": "I know it's not right to charge $10 for what was a free game. But honestly, it's still worth it because this game is bad mutha effin awesome!  I downloaded the first demo q3dm17 for free when it first came out and never have I ever experience a game giving you complete freedom of aim, movement, and reflexes only limited by your physical body.  I then bought quake 3 arena in 1999 for $20. Played dual on t6 forever back when mplayer was around.  Then downloaded q3wave ctf and hooked again. Then Rocket Arena 3 (RA3) came out and once again changed my life through college. Each session of play is rewarded by the next session when you can feel your movement, coordination, aim, and adrenaline flurry and improving with time as your brain rewires you to become better. No game can reward you like this one for the time and effort required to acquire the raw reflexes and skill.  Quake live browser was a fail, but because this game is built for speed, which browsers cannot keep up. Back in the day, we mod the cfg to squeeze ever ounce of fps, because speed was all that matter, even if it sacrifice visuals.  Thank God quake live went Native Desktop.  For $20, I played the hell out of this game from 1999 to now. So technically, this was originally not free. But hell, I'll pay again and again. Got more fun out of this than the crazy amount of money people spend on WoW, or other pay2win games.  And don't even complain about the high skill ceiling, that's why this game is awesome. I was crushed in the beginning and months of play paid off. Hell, I still get crushed by many today, it's awesome to know good players are out there. Best fair game with no leveling BS as everyone is on equal footing with the same health, armor, and weapons. Only thing setting you apart is your strategy and skill.  Then you have pql, which is the already fast paced game now on speed, wtf... awesome. This game keeps surprising me after 18 years. *sniff*  And the friend I recommended this game to back in college hated it at first. But then played it straight through summer and broke the first skill threshold. He never looked back and today his skill far surpasses mine, though I'm creeping back up (so watch out bro). Awesome.  So yeah, don't ruin this bad ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game by whining about a measly $10. I'd pay $100 easy for it. But got my money's worth. 18 years of awesomeness for $20. Thank you ID and John Carmack.  Of course this game is not for everyone. It will not reward you with frags immediately like most games. It is not nice to newbies, but you can start a ffa map with bots to improve, You will get slaughtered... but if you hang in there, I promise you will understand and see what I see. When you hit 1400+ elo, you will love the game even though your kill/death ratio is 1:1.  Anyways, my two cents. The development and work that has been put in is well justifies (if not more) than the $10 cost. So good job guys, kudos to the developers for keeping my favorite game alive.",

What looks like a arcade-arena shooter is an ultra-fast tactical experience. Besides aiming the player will need skill in map-awareness, item-timing, movement and tactics. Quake is the only game that gets my heart beating faster and my hands shivering after an intense round of 10 minute gameplay. I'd recommend to find someone to teach you how to quake for a better experience, and alot of training.

I will start off by saying I think ten bucks flat is better since you get all the added features and the features that were previously reserved only for premium subscribers. The game itself is a modernization of q3a and it brings the game into the modern age with some gameplay features. No added classes and other ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but modern features like workshop integration, custom maps, a modern looking server browser, etc. I have put over 1000 hours into this game over the course of this past year and see myself playing it till it is 100% dead. It is so easy to get started, mess around with friends in free for all, ctf, etc. Though, if you are more of the competitive type, you will find game modes to suit your play. Though be warned, getting exceptionally good at this game requires you to go down the figurative rabbit hole and practice self-control, coordination, self-reliance, and humility. In duel (the mose common competitive mode) particularly. In duel, it is 1v1 and the goal is to just be a better player than your opponent. I have put a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ton of time into practice, reviewing demos, watching and studying pro-matches, etc. This game is such a basic fps on the surface but makes you practice creating quick strategies, forward thinking, and the ability to read an opponent to predict how they will play. If you play this game and get very good, the skills you learn will carry over into other games i.e. counter strike, COD, UT4, Overwatch, and quite possibly, Quake Champions. Only time will tell what the future holds for these cut throat, unforgiving FPS games, but as of now, Quake live is an incredible game and I can not recommend it enough for casual and competitive play alike.",

I doubt you will enjoy this game if you were not playing shooter games in the 90's. Highly comparable to Quake III but without modding and no cross-platform support (a step backward in my opinion). It's not that this game is great but it's that all other shooter games now are crap now.   Despite not having official mods, some crafty hackers developed programs named minqlx and minqlbot which uses dll injection to allow server admins to be tyranical even when they're afk. Most servers ran have these minqlx or minqlbot which are usually configured to censor speech, automatically pass votes when most people didn't vote, or play annoying music.   Now you must be careful, if you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• anyone off they will callvote to kick you and minqlx will usually automatically pass the vote, either that or the admin will for fun (this is especially true on canadian ran servers because they don't believe in democracy).   There are only a few active servers which are usually overpopulated. And only 2 active game types: FFA or team elimination. So you have the choice of 16 player FFA on really small maps, or 16 player clan arena where you have to wait for at least 10 minutes before they let you join. Choice #1 gives you lots of rocket spam and spawn fragging. Choice #2 gives you a game where you're mostly waiting in the queue to play, then you died and you have to wait for the round to restart.   I only play this because I'm already good at it, I cannot recommend this to a normal person.",

To start off, Loadouts are now optional and aren't P2P to remove. This is very good because it diverses the toxic players from the people who want to learn quake live or just want to have fun to shoot some people. Before I had a very big issue with learning how to play Quake Live against other actual players, but since now Loadouts are now disabled by default, the community can grow again. Now you wont pop around the corner and get your head blown off by a rocket launcher, every single time. Voice chat was also added appearently, which can add a huge element of playstyle on QL that requires teamwork to win. I haven't played too much yet but I can already see the potential in this game.  There's even a course in the game it's self that allows you to practice strafe jumping without the need to download a custom map.",
