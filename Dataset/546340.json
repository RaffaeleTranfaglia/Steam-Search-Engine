The dev did not host a giveaway and retract it like 'Evil Maze'.....if it was that scenario. Then, I would understand the negativity.  It was an accident, so just let it go. Devs/Publisher don't make games for free...who is going to pay the electic bill.  Removed from my account too, but don't really care. Don't think I would spend time on it anyways......and the ones whining probably wouldn't either.",
