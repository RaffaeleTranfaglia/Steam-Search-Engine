            "review_text": "Toadled is a clicker game with a 'Katamari Damacy' vibe. Gameplay is simple: eat everything on screen that is not a bomb, and use coins to upgrade stats as you go from form to form until eventually you eat everything.  You can finish the game in half an hour or so if you upgrade smart and just keep clicking, but the game has a lot of achievements and optional challenges that expand the play time.  What I liked: -The silly art style -The collectible comic -Ease of the gameplay  What I didn't like: -The various 'avoider' things that keep getting away from the mouse and I basically could only eat with slow-mo -The overall look of the slowmo mode. The whole background etc. disappears  Overall a good game for the price. Definitely worth spending a few playthroughs in.",
